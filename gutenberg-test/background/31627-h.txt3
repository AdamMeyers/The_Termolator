PREFACE.


It has not been my object to present in the following
pages even an approximately complete description
of the volcanic and seismic phenomena of the globe;
such an undertaking would involve an amount of
labour which few would be bold enough to attempt;
nor would it be compatible with the aims of the
Contemporary Science Series.

I have rather chosen to illustrate the most recent
conclusions regarding the phenomena and origin of
volcanic action, by the selection of examples drawn
from the districts where these phenomena have been
most carefully observed and recorded under the light
of modern geological science. I have also endeavoured
to show, by illustrations carried back into later geological
epochs, how the volcanic phenomena of the
present day do not differ in kind, though they may
in degree, from those of the past history of our globe.
For not only do the modes of eruption of volcanic
materials in past geological times resemble those of
the present or human epoch, but the materials themselves
[Pg viii]are so similar in character that it is only in
consequence of alterations in structure or composition
which the original materials have undergone, since
their extrusion, that any important distinctions can
be recognised between the volcanic products of recent
times and those of earlier periods.

I have, finally, endeavoured to find an answer to
two interesting and important questions: (1) Are we
now living in an epoch of extraordinary volcanic
energy?       a question which such terrible outbursts
as we have recently witnessed in Japan, the Malay
Archipelago, and even in Italy, naturally suggest;
and (2) What is the ultimate cause of volcanic
action? On this latter point I am gratified to find
that my conclusions are in accordance with those
expounded by one who has been appropriately
designated "the Nestor of Modern Geology," Professor
Prestwich.

Within the last few years the study of the structure
and composition of volcanic rocks, by means of the
microscope brought to bear on their translucent
sections, has added wonderfully to our knowledge
of such rocks, and has become a special branch of
petrological investigation. Commenced by Sorby,
and carried on by Allport, Zirkel, Rosenbusch, Von
Lasaulx, Teall, and many more enthusiastic students,
it has thrown a flood of light upon our knowledge of
the mutual relations of the component minerals of
igneous masses, the alteration these minerals have
undergone in some cases, and the conditions under
[Pg ix]which they have been erupted and consolidated. But
nothing that has been observed has tended materially
to alter conclusions arrived at by other processes of
reasoning regarding volcanic phenomena, and for
these we have to fall back upon observations conducted
in the field on a more or less large scale,
and carried on before, during, and after eruptions.
Macroscopic and microscopic observations have to
go hand in hand in the study of volcanic phenomena.

INTRODUCTION.




CHAPTER I.

HISTORIC NOTICES OF VOLCANIC ACTION.


There are no manifestations of the forces of Nature
more calculated to inspire us with feelings of awe
and admiration than volcanic eruptions preceded or
accompanied, as they generally are, by earthquake
shocks. Few agents have been so destructive in
their effects; and to the real dangers which follow
such terrestrial convulsions are to be added the
feelings of uncertainty and revulsion which arise from
the fact that the earth upon which we tread, and
which we have been accustomed to regard as the
emblem of stability, may become at any moment the
agent of our destruction. It is, therefore, not surprising
that the ancient Greeks, who, as well as the
Romans, were close observers of the phenomena of
Nature, should have investigated the causes of terrestrial
disturbances, and should have come to some
[Pg 2]conclusions upon them in accordance with the light
they possessed. These terrible forces presented to
the Greeks, who clothed all the operations of Nature
in poetic imagery and deified her forces, their poetical
and mystical side; and as there was a deity for every
natural force, so there was one for earthquakes and
volcanoes. Vulcan, the deformed son of Juno (whose
name bears so strange a resemblance to that of "the
first artificer in iron" of the Bible, Tubal Cain), is
condemned to pass his days under Mount Etna,
fabricating the thunderbolts of Jove, and arms for
the gods and great heroes of antiquity.

The Pythagoreans appear to have held the doctrine
of a central fire
(                                                  )
as the source of volcanic
phenomena; and in the Dialogues of Plato allusion
is made to a subterranean reservoir of lava, which,
according to Simplicius, was in accordance with
the doctrine of the Pythagoreans which Plato was
recounting.[1] Thucydides clearly describes the effect
of earthquakes upon coast-lines of the Grecian Archipelago,
similar to that which took place in the case of
the earthquake of Lisbon, the sea first retiring and
afterwards inundating the shore. Pliny supposed
that it was by earthquake avulsion that islands were
naturally formed. Thus Sicily was torn from Italy,
Cyprus from Syria, Eub      a from B      otia, and the rest;
but this view was previously enunciated by Aristotle
in his
"                                                             ,"
where he states that earthquakes
have torn to pieces many parts of the earth, while
lands have been converted into sea, and that tracts
once covered by the sea have been converted into
dry land.

[Pg 3]But the most philosophical views regarding terrestrial
phenomena are those given by Ovid as having
been held by Pythagoras (about B.C. 580). In the
Metamorphoses his views regarding the interchange
of land and sea, the effects of running water in
eroding valleys, the growth of deltas, the effect of
earthquakes in burying cities and diverting streams
from their sources, are remarkable anticipations of
doctrines now generally held.[2] But what most concerns
us at present are his views regarding the
changes which have come over volcanic mountains. In
his day Vesuvius was dormant, but Etna was active;
so his illustrations are drawn from the latter mountain;
and in this connection he observes that volcanic vents
shift their position. There was a time, he says, when
Etna was not a burning mountain, and the time will
come when it will cease to burn; whether it be that
some caverns become closed up by the movements
of the earth, or others opened, or whether the fuel
is finally exhausted.[3] Strabo may be regarded as
[Pg 4]having originated the view, now generally held, that
active volcanoes are safety-valves to the regions in
which they are situated. Referring to the tradition
recorded by Pliny, that Sicily was torn from Italy by
an earthquake, he observes that the land near the sea
in those parts was rarely shaken by earthquakes, since
there are now orifices whereby fire and ignited matters
and waters escape; but formerly, when the volcanoes
of Etna, the Lipari Islands, Ischia, and others were
closed up, the imprisoned fire and wind might have
produced far more violent movements.[4]

The account of the first recorded eruption of
Vesuvius has been graphically related by the younger
Pliny in his two letters to Tacitus, to which I shall
have occasion to refer further on.[5] These bring down
the references to volcanic phenomena amongst ancient
authors to the commencement of the Christian era;
from all of which we may infer that the more
enlightened philosophers of antiquity had a general
idea that eruptions had their origin in a central fire
within the interior of the earth, that volcanic mountains
were liable to become dormant for long periods,
and afterwards to break out into renewed activity,
that there existed a connection between volcanic
action and earthquakes, and that volcanoes are safety-valves
for the regions around.

It is unnecessary that I should pursue the historical
sketch further. Those who wish to know the views
of writers of the Middle Ages will find them recorded
[Pg 5]by Sir Charles Lyell.[6] The long controversy carried
on during the latter part of the eighteenth century
between "Neptunists," led by Werner on the one
side, and "Vulcanists," led by Hutton and Playfair
on the other, regarding the origin of such rocks as
granite and basalt, was finally brought to a close by the
triumph of the "Vulcanists," who demonstrated that
such rocks are the result of igneous fusion; and that
in the cases of basalt and its congeners, they are being
extruded from volcanic vents at the present day.
The general principles for the classification of rocks
as recognised in modern science may be regarded as
having been finally established by James Hutton, of
Edinburgh, in his Theory of the Earth,[7] while they
were illustrated and defended by Professor Playfair in
his work entitled, Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory
of the Earth,[8] although other observers, such as
Desmarest, Collini, and Guettard, had in other
countries come to very clear views on this subject.

The following are some of the more important
works on the phenomena of volcanoes and earthquakes
published during the present century:       [9]

1. Poulett Scrope, F.R.S., Considerations on Volcanoes
(1825). This work is dedicated to Lyell, his
fellow-worker in the same department of science, and
was undertaken, as he says, "in order to help to
dispel that signal delusion as to the mode of action
of the subtelluric forces with which the Elevation-Crater
theory had mystified the geological world."
The second edition was published in 1872.

[Pg 6]2. This was followed by the admirable work, On
the Extinct Volcanoes of Central France, published in
1826 (2nd edition, 1858), and is one of the most complete
monographs on a special volcanic district ever
written.

3. Dr. Samuel Hibbert, History of the Extinct Volcanoes
of the Basin of Neuwied on the Lower Rhine
(1832). Dr. Hibbert's work is one of remarkable
merit, if we consider the time at which it was written.
For not only does it give a clear and detailed account
of the volcanic phenomena of the Eifel and the Lower
Rhine, but it anticipates the principles upon which
modern writers account for the formation of river
valleys and other physical features; and in working
out the physical history of the Rhine valley below
Mainz, and its connection with the extinct volcanoes
which are found on both banks of that river, he has
taken very much the same line of reasoning which
was some years afterwards adopted by Sir A. Ramsay
when dealing with the same subject. It does not
appear that the latter writer was aware of Dr.
Hibbert's treatise.

4. Leopold von Buch, Description Physique des Iles
Canaries (1825), translated from the original by C.
Boulanger (1836); Geognostische Reise (Berlin, 1809),
2 vols.; and Reise durch Italien (1809). From a large
number of writings on volcanoes by this distinguished
traveller, whom Alexander von Humboldt calls "dem
geistreichen Forscher der Natur," the above are
selected as being the most important. That on the
Canaries is accompanied by a large atlas, in which
the volcanoes of Teneriffe, Palma, and Lancerote,
with some others, are elaborately represented, and
are considered to bear out the author's views regarding
[Pg 7]the formation of volcanic cones by elevation or
upheaval. The works dealing with the volcanic
phenomena of Central and Southern Italy are also
written with the object, in part at least, of illustrating
and supporting the same theoretical views; with
these we have to deal in the next chapter.

5. Dr. Charles Daubeny, F.R.S., Description of Active
and Extinct Volcanoes, of Earthquakes, and of Thermal
Springs, with remarks on the causes of these phenomena,
the character of their respective products, and their
influence on the past and present condition of the globe
(2nd edition, 1848). In this work the author gives
detailed descriptions of almost all the known volcanic
districts of the globe, and defends what is called "the
chemical theory of volcanic action"       a theory at one
time held by Sir Humphrey Davy.

6. Wolfgang Sartorius von Waltershausen, Der
Ætna. This work possesses a melancholy interest
from the fact that its distinguished author did not
live to see its publication. Von Waltershausen, having
spent several years in making an elaborate survey of
Etna, produced an atlas containing numerous detailed
maps, views, and drawings of this mountain and its
surroundings, which were published at Weimar by
Engelmann in 1858. A description in MS. to accompany
the atlas was also prepared, but before it was
printed, the author died, on the 16th October 1876.
The MS. having been put into the hands of the late
Professor Arnold von Lasaulx by the publisher of
the atlas, it was subsequently brought out under the
care of this distinguished petrologist, who was so
fully fitted for an undertaking of this kind.

7. Sir Charles Lyell in his Principles of Geology[10]
[Pg 8]devotes several chapters to the consideration of
volcanic phenomena, in which, being in harmony
with the views of his friend, Poulett Scrope, he combats
the "elevation theory" of Von Buch, as applied
to the formation of volcanic mountains, holding that
they are built up of ashes, stones, and scoriæ blown
out of the throat of the volcano and piled around
the orifice in a conical form. Together with these
materials are sheets of lava extruded in a molten
condition from the sides or throat of the crater itself.

8. Professor J. W. Judd, F.R.S., in his able work
entitled, Volcanoes: What they are, and what they
teach,[11] has furnished the student of vulcanicity with a
very complete manual of a general character on the
subject. The author, having extensive personal
acquaintance with the volcanoes of the south of
Europe and the volcanic rocks of the British Isles,
was well equipped for undertaking a work of the
kind; and in it he supports the views of Lyell and
Scrope regarding the mode of formation of volcanic
mountains.

9. Sir Archibald Geikie, F.R.S., in his elaborate
monograph[12] on the Tertiary Volcanic Rocks of the
British Isles, has recorded his views regarding the
origin and succession of the plateau basalts and

CHAPTER II.

FORM, STRUCTURE, AND COMPOSITION OF
VOLCANIC MOUNTAINS.


The conical form of a volcanic mountain is so
generally recognised, that many persons who have no
intelligent acquaintance with geological phenomena
are in the habit of attributing to all mountains having
a conical form, and especially if accompanied by a
truncated apex, a volcanic origin. Yet this is very far
from being the fact, as some varieties of rock, such as
quartzite, not unfrequently assume this shape. Of
such we have an example in the case of Errigal,
a quartzite mountain in Donegal, nearly 3000
feet high, which bears a very near approach in form
to a perfect cone or pyramid, and yet is in no way
connected, as regards its origin or structure, with
volcanic phenomena. Another remarkable instance
is that of Schehallion in Scotland, also composed
of quartz-rock; and others may be found amongst
the ranges of Islay and Jura, described by Sir A.
Geikie.[1]

Notwithstanding, however, such exceptions, which
might be greatly multiplied, the majority of cone-shaped
mountains over the globe have a volcanic
[Pg 11]origin.[2] The origin of this form in each case is
entirely distinct. In the case of quartzite mountains,
the conical form is due to atmospheric influences
acting on a rock of uniform composition, traversed by
numerous joints and fissures crossing each other at
obtuse angles, along which the rock breaks up and falls
away, so that the sides are always covered by angular
shingle forming slopes corresponding to the angle of
friction of the rock in question. In the case of a
volcanic mountain, however, the same form is due
either to accumulation of fragmental material piled
around the cup-shaped hollow, or crater, which is
usually placed at the apex of the cone, and owing
to which it is bluntly terminated, or else to the welling
up from beneath of viscous matter in the manner
presently to be described.

Views of Sir Humphrey Davy and L. von Buch.       The
question how a volcanic cone came to be
formed was not settled without a long controversy
carried on by several naturalists of eminence. Some
of the earlier writers of modern times on the subject
of vulcanicity       such as Sir Humphrey Davy and
Leopold von Buch       maintained that the conical
form was due to upheaval by a force acting from
below at a central focus, whereby the materials
of which the mountain is formed were forced to
assume a quâ-quâ versal position       that is, a position
in which the materials dip away from the central
focus in every direction. But this view, originally
[Pg 12]contested by Scrope and Lyell, has now been
generally abandoned. It will be seen on reflection
that if a series of strata of ashes, tuff, and lava,
originally horizontal, or nearly so, were to be forced
upwards into a conical form by a central force, the
result would be the formation of a series of radiating
fissures ever widening from the circumference towards
the focus. In the case of a large mountain such
fissures, whether filled with lava or otherwise, would
be of great breadth towards the focus, or central
crater, and could not fail to make manifest beyond
dispute their mechanical origin. But no fissures of
the kind here referred to are, as a matter of fact, to be
observed. Those which do exist are too insignificant
and too irregular in direction to be ascribed to such
an origin; so that the views of Von Buch and Davy
must be dismissed, as being unsupported by observation,
and as untenable on dynamical grounds. As a
matter of fact, the "elevatory theory," or the "elevation-crater
theory," as it is called by Scrope, has been
almost universally abandoned by writers on vulcanicity.

Principal Varieties of Volcanic Mountains as regards
Form.       But whilst rejecting the "elevatory theory," it
is necessary to bear in mind that volcanic cones and
dome-shaped elevations have been formed in several
distinct ways, giving rise to varieties of structure essentially
different. Two of the more general of these
varieties of form, the crater-cone and the dome, are
found in some districts, as in Auvergne, side by side.
The crater-cone consists of beds or sheets of ashes,
lapilli, and slag piled up in a conical form, with a central
crater (or cup) containing the principal pipe through
which these materials have been erupted; the dome,
[Pg 13]of a variety of trachytic lava, which has been extruded
in a molten, or viscous, condition from a central pipe,
and in such cases there is no distinct crater. There
are other forms of volcanic mountains, such as those
built up of basaltic matter, of which I shall have to
speak hereafter, but the two former varieties are the
most prevalent; and we may now proceed to consider
the conditions under which the crater-cone volcanoes
have been formed.

Crateriform Volcanic Cones.       Of this class nearly
all the active volcanoes of the Mediterranean region       Etna,
Vesuvius, Stromboli, and the Lipari Islands       may
be considered as representatives. They consist
essentially of masses of fragmental material, which
have from time to time been blown out of an orifice
and piled up around with more or less regularity
(according to the force exerted, and direction of
the prevalent winds), alternating with sheets of lava.
In this way mountains several thousand feet in height
and of vast horizontal extent are formed. The fragmental
materials thus accumulated are of all sizes,
from the finest dust up to blocks many tons in weight,
the latter being naturally piled around nearest to
the orifice. The fine dust, blown high into the air
by the explosive force of the gases and vapours, is
often carried to great distances by the prevalent
winds. Thus during the eruption of Vesuvius in A.D.
472 showers of ashes, carried high into the air by the
westerly wind, fell over Constantinople at a distance
of 750 miles.[3]

[Pg 14]These loose, or partially consolidated, fragmental
materials are rudely stratified, and slope downwards
and outwards from the edge of the crater, so as to
present the appearance of what is known as "the
dip" of stratified deposits which have been upraised
from the horizontal position by terrestrial forces. It
was this excentrical arrangement which gave rise to
the supposition that such volcanic ash-beds had been
tilted up by a force acting in the direction of the
volcanic throat, or orifice of eruption. The interior
wall of Monte di Somma, the original crater of
Vesuvius, presents a good illustration of such fragmental
beds. I shall have occasion further on to
describe more fully the structure of this remarkable
mountain; so that it will suffice to say here that this
old prehistoric crater, the walls of which enclose the
modern cone of Vesuvius, is seen to be formed of
irregular beds of ash, scoriæ, and fragmental masses,
traversed by numerous dykes of lava, and sloping
away outwards towards the surrounding plains.

Of similar materials are the flanks of Etna composed,
even at great distances from the central crater;
the beds of ash and agglomerate sometimes alternating
with sheets of solidified lava and traversed
by dykes of similar material of later date, injected
from below through fissures formed during periods of
eruptive energy. Numerous similar examples are to
be observed in the Auvergne region of Central France
and the Eifel. And here we find remarkable cases of
"breached cones," or craters, which will require some
special description. Standing on the summit of the
Puy de Dôme, and looking northwards or southwards,
the eye wanders over a tract formed of dome-shaped
hills and of extinct crater-cones rising from
[Pg 15]a granitic platform. But what is most peculiar in
the scene is the ruptured condition of a large number
of the cones with craters. In such cases the wall of
the crater has been broken down on one side, and we
observe that a stream of lava has been poured out
through the breach and overflowed the plain below.
The cause of this breached form is sufficiently obvious.
In such cases there has been an explosion of ashes,
stones, and scoriæ from the volcanic throat, by which
a cone-shaped hill with a crater has been built up.
This has been followed by molten lava welling up
through the throat, and gradually filling the crater.
But, as the lava is much more dense than the material
of which the crater wall is composed, the pressure
of the lava outwards has become too great for the
resistance of the wall, which consequently has given
way at its weakest part and, a breach being formed,
the molten matter has flowed out in a stream which
has inundated the country lying at the base of the
cone. In one instance mentioned by Scrope, the
original upper limit of the lake of molten lava has
left its mark in the form of a ring of slag on the
inside of the breached crater.[4]

Craterless Domes.       These differ essentially both in
form and composition from those just described,
and have their typical representatives in the
Auvergne district, though not without their analogues
elsewhere, as in the case of Chimborazo, in
South America, one of the loftiest volcanic mountains
in the world.

[Pg 16]


  



Fig. 2.       Cotopaxi, a volcano of the Cordilleras of Quito, still active,
and covered by snow down to a level of 14,800 feet. Below this is a
zone of naked rock, succeeded by another of forest vegetation. Owing
to the continuous extrusion of lava from the crater, the cone is being
gradually built up of fresh material, and the crater is comparatively small
in consequence.       (A diagrammatic view after A. von Humboldt.)




Taking the Puy de Dôme, Petit Suchet, Cliersou,
Grand Sarcoui in Auvergne, and the Mamelon in the
Isle of Bourbon as illustrations, we have in all these
cases a group of volcanic hills, dome-shaped and
destitute of craters, the summits being rounded or
slightly flattened. We also observe that the flanks
rise more abruptly from their bases, and contrast in
outline with the graceful curve of the crater cones.
[Pg 17]The dome-shaped volcanoes are generally composed of
felsitic matter, whether domite, trachyte, or andesite,
which has been extruded in a molten or viscous
condition from some orifice or fissure in the earth's
crust, and being piled up and spreading outwards,
necessarily assumes such a form as that of a dome,
as has been shown by experiment on a small scale by
Dr. E. Reyer, of Grätz.[5] The contrast between the
two forms (those of the dome and the crater-cone) is
exemplified in the case of the Grand Sarcoui and its
neighbours. The former is composed of a species of
trachyte; the latter of ashes and fragmental matter
which have been blown out of their respective vents of
eruption into the air, and piled up and around in a
crateriform manner with sides of gradually diminishing
slope outwards, thus giving rise to the characteristic
volcanic curve. The two varieties here
referred to, contrasting in form, composition, and
colour of material, can be clearly recognised from the
summit of the Puy de Dôme, which rises by a head
and shoulders above its fellows, and thus affords an
advantageous standpoint from which to compare the
various forms of this remarkable group of volcanic
mountains.

Cotopaxi (Fig. 2) has been generally supposed to be
a dome; but Whymper, who ascended the mountain
in 1880, shows that it is a cone with a crater, 2,300
feet in largest diameter. He determined the height to
be 19,613 feet above the ocean. Its real elevation
above the sea is somewhat masked, owing to the fact
that it rises from the high plain of Tapia, which is
[Pg 18]itself 8,900 feet above the sea surface. The smaller
peak on the right (Fig. 2) is that of Carihuairazo,
which reaches an elevation of over 16,000 feet.

Chimborazo, in Columbia, province of Quito, is one
of the loftiest of the chain of the Andes, and is
situated in lat. 1° 30' S., long. 78° 58' W. Though not
in a state of activity, it is wholly composed of volcanic
material, and reaches an elevation of over 20,000 feet
above the ocean; its sides being covered by a sheet
of permanent snow to a level of 2,600 feet below the
summit.[6] Seen from the shores of the Pacific, after
the long rains of winter, it presents a magnificent
spectacle, "when the transparency of the air is
increased, and its enormous circular summit is seen
projected upon the deep azure blue of the equatorial
sky. The great rarity of the air through which the
tops of the Andes are seen adds much to the splendour
of the snow, and aids the magical effect of its
reflection."

Chimborazo was ascended by Humboldt and Bonpland
in 1802 almost to the summit; but at a height
of 19,300 feet by barometrical measurement, their
further ascent was arrested by a wide chasm. Boussingault,
in company with Colonel Hall, accomplished
the ascent as far as the foot of the mass of columnar
"trachyte," the upper surface of which, covered
by a dome of snow, forms the summit of the mountain.
The whole mass of the mountain consists
of volcanic rock, varieties of andesite; there is no
trace of a crater, nor of any fragmental materials,
[Pg 19]such as are usually ejected from a volcanic vent of
eruption.[7]

Lava Crater-Cones.       A third form of volcanic
mountain is that which has been built up by successive
eruptions of basic lava, such as basalt or dolerite,
when in a molten condition. These are very rare,
and the slope of the sides depends on the amount of
original viscosity. Where the lava is highly fused its
slope will be slight, but if in a viscous condition,
successive outpourings from the orifice, unable to
reach the base of the mountain, will tend to form a
cone with increasing slope upwards. Mauna Loa
and Kilauea, in the Hawaiian Group, according to
Professor J. D. Dana, are basalt volcanoes in a normal
state. They have distinct craters, and the material
of which the mountain is formed is basalt or dolerite.
The volcano of Rangitoto in Auckland, New Zealand,
appears to belong to this class.

Basalt is the most fusible of volcanic rocks, owing
to the augite and magnetite it contains, so that it
spreads out with a very slight slope when highly
fused. Trachyte, on the other hand, is the least
fusible owing to the presence of orthoclase felspar, or
quartz; so that the volcanic domes formed of this
material stand at a higher angle from the horizon
than those of basaltic cones.

[1] Scenery and Geology of Scotland (1865), p. 214.

[2] Humboldt says: "The form of isolated conical mountains, as
those of Vesuvius, Etna, the Peak of Teneriffe, Tunguagua, and
Cotopaxi, is certainly the shape most commonly observed in volcanoes
all over the globe."       Views of Nature, translated by E. C. Otté and
H. G. Bohn (1850).

[3] It is supposed that after the disastrous explosion of Krakatoa in
1883 the fine dust carried into the higher regions of the atmosphere
was carried round almost the entire globe, and remained suspended for
a lengthened period, as described in a future page.

[4] Another remarkable case is mentioned and figured by Judd, where
one of the Lipari Isles, composed of pumice and rising out of the
Mediterranean, has been breached by a lava-stream of obsidian.       Loc.
cit., p. 123.

[5] Reyer has produced such dome-shaped masses by forcing a quantity
of plaster of Paris in a pasty condition up through an orifice in a board;
referred to by Judd, loc. cit., p. 125.

[6] Whymper determined the height to be 20,498 feet; Reiss and
Stübel make it 20,703 feet. Whymper thinks there may be a crater
concealed beneath the dome of snow.       Travels amongst the Great
Andes of the Equator, by Edward Whymper (1892).

[7] Whymper states that there is a prevalent idea that Cotopaxi and a
volcano called Sangai act as safety-valves to each other. Sangai reaches
an elevation (according to Reiss and Stübel) of 17,464 feet, and sends
intermittent jets of steam high into the air, spreading out into vast
cumulus clouds, which float away southwards, and ultimately disappear.       Ibid.,
p. 73.

CHAPTER III.

LINES AND GROUPS OF ACTIVE VOLCANIC VENTS.


The globe is girdled by a chain of volcanic
mountains in a state of greater or less activity, which
may perhaps be considered a girdle of safety for the
whole world, through which the masses of molten
matter in a state of high pressure beneath the crust
find a way of escape; and thus the structure of the
globe is preserved from even greater convulsions than
those which from time to time take place at various
points on its surface. This girdle is partly terrestrial,
partly submarine; and commencing at Mount Erebus,
near the Antarctic Pole, ranging through South
Shetland Isle, Cape Horn, the Andes of South
America, the Isthmus of Panama, then through
Central America and Mexico, and the Rocky Mountains
to Kamtschatka, the Aleutian Islands, the
Kuriles, the Japanese, the Philippines, New Guinea,
and New Zealand, reaches the Antarctic Circle by the
Balleny Islands. This girdle sends off branches at
several points. (See Map, p. 23.)

[Pg 21]



  



Fig. 3.       Volcanic cone of Orizaba (Cittaltepeth), in Mexico, now
extinct; the upper part snow-clad, and at its base forest vegetation; it
reaches a height of 16,302 Parisian feet above the sea.       (After A. von
Humboldt.)





(a.) The linear arrangement of active or dormant
volcanic vents has been pointed out by Humboldt,
Von Buch, Daubeny, and other writers. The great
range of burning mountains of the Andes of Chili,
Peru, Bolivia, and Mexico, that of the Aleutian
Islands, of Kamtschatka and the Kurile Islands,
extending southwards into the Philippines, and the
branching range of the Sunda Islands are well-known
examples. That of the West Indian Islands,
ranging from Grenada through St. Vincent, St.
Lucia, Martinique, Dominica, Guadeloupe, Montserrat,
Nevis, and St. Eustace,[1] is also a remarkable
example of the linear arrangement of volcanic
[Pg 22]mountains. On tracing these ranges on a map
of the world[2] (Map, p. 23), it will be observed
that they are either strings of islands, or lie in
proximity to the ocean; and hence the view was
naturally entertained by some writers that oceanic
water, or at any rate that of a large lake or sea,
was a necessary agent in the production of volcanic
eruptions. This view seems to receive further corroboration
from the fact that the interior portions
of the continents and large islands such as Australia
are destitute of volcanoes in action, with the remarkable
exceptions of Mounts Kenia and Kilimanjaro in
Central Africa, and a few others. It is also very
significant in this connection that many of the
volcanoes now extinct, or at least dormant, both in
Europe and Asia, appear to have been in proximity
to sheets of water during the period of activity.
Thus the old volcanoes of the Haurân, east of the
Jordan, appear to have been active at the period
when the present Jordan valley was filled with water
to such an extent as to constitute a lake two hundred
miles in length, but which has now shrunk back to
within the present limits of the Dead Sea.[3] Again,
at the period when the extinct volcanoes of Central
France were in active operation, an extensive lake
overspread the tract lying to the east of the granitic
plateau on which the craters and domes are planted,
now constituting the rich and fertile plain of Clermont.

[Pg 23]




  



Such instances are too significant to allow us to
[Pg 24]doubt that water in some form is very generally
connected with volcanic operations; but it does not
follow that it was necessary to the original formation
of volcanic vents, whether linear or sporadic. If
this were so, the extinct volcanoes of the British
Isles would still be active, as they are close to the
sea-margin, and no volcano would now be active
which is not near to some large sheet of water.
But Jorullo, one of the great active volcanoes of
Mexico, lies no less than 120 miles from the ocean,
and Cotopaxi, in Ecuador, is nearly equally distant.
Kilimanjaro, 18,881 feet high, and Kenia, in the
equatorial regions of Central Africa, are about 150
miles from the Victoria Nyanza, and a still greater
distance from the ocean; and Mount Demavend, in
Persia, which rises to an elevation of 18,464 feet near
the southern shore of the Caspian Sea, a volcanic
mountain of the first magnitude, is now extinct or
dormant.[4] Such facts as these all tend to show that
although water may be an accessory of volcanic
eruptions, it is not in all cases essential; and we
are obliged, therefore, to have recourse to some other
theory of volcanic action differing from that which
would attribute it to the access of water to highly
heated or molten matter within the crust of the earth.

(b.) Leopold von Buch on Rents and Fissures in the
Earth's Crust.       The view of Leopold von Buch, who
considered that the great lines of volcanic mountains
above referred to rise along the borders of rents, or
fissures, in the earth's crust, is one which is inherently
[Pg 25]probable, and is in keeping with observation. That
the crust of the globe is to a remarkable extent
fissured and torn in all directions is a phenomenon
familiar to all field geologists. Such rents and fissures
are often accompanied by displacement of the strata,
owing to which the crust has been vertically elevated
on one side or lowered on the other, and such displacements
(or "faults") sometimes amount to thousands
of feet. It is only occasionally, however, that such
fractures are accompanied by the extrusion of molten
matter; and in the North of England and Scotland
dykes of igneous rock, such as basalt, which run
across the country for many miles in nearly straight
lines, often cut across the faults, and are only rarely
coincident with them. Nevertheless, it can scarcely
be a question that the grand chain of volcanic
mountains which stretches almost continuously along
the Andes of South America, and northwards through
Mexico, has been piled up along the line of a system
of fissures in the fundamental rocks parallel to the
coast, though not actually coincident therewith.

(c.) The Cordilleras of Quito.       The structure and
arrangement of the Cordilleras of Quito, for example,
are eminently suggestive of arrangement along lines
of fissure. As shown by Alexander von Humboldt,[5]
the volcanic mountains are disposed in two parallel
chains, which run side by side for a distance of over
500 miles northwards into the State of Columbia, and
enclose between them the high plains of Quito and
Lacunga. Along the eastern chain are the great
cones of El Altar, rising to an elevation of 16,383
feet above the ocean, and having an enormous crater
apparently dormant or extinct, and covered with snow;
[Pg 26]then Cotopaxi (Fig. 2), its sides covered with snow,
and sending forth from its crater several columns of
smoke; then Guamani and Cayambe (19,000 feet), huge
truncated cones apparently extinct; these constitute
the eastern chain of volcanic heights. The western
chain contains even loftier mountains. Here we find
the gigantic Chimborazo, an extinct volcano whose
summit is white with snow; Carihuairazo[6] and Illiniza,
a lofty pointed peak like the Matterhorn; Corazon, a
snow-clad dome, reaching a height of 15,871 feet;
Atacazo and Pichincha, the latter an extinct volcano
reaching an elevation of 15,920 feet; such is the
western chain, remarkable for its straightness, the
volcanic cones being planted in one grand procession
from south to north. This rectilinear arrangement of
the western chain, only a little less conspicuous in the
eastern, is very suggestive of a line of fracture
in the crust beneath. And when we contemplate
the prodigious quantity of matter included
within the limits of these colossal domes and their
environments, all of which has been extruded from the
internal reservoirs, we gain some idea of the manner
in which the contracting crust disposes of the matter
it can no longer contain.[7]

Between the volcanoes of Quito and those of Peru
there is an intervening space of fourteen degrees of
[Pg 27]latitude. This is occupied by the Andes, regarding
the structure of which we have not much information
except that at this part of its course it is not volcanic.
But from Arequipa in Peru (lat. 16° S.), an active
volcano, we find a new series of volcanic mountains
continued southwards through Tacora (19,740 feet),
then further south the more or less active vents of
Sajama (22,915 feet), Coquina, Tutupaca, Calama,
Atacama, Toconado, and others, forming an almost
continuous range with that part of the desert of
Atacama pertaining to Chili. Through this country
we find the volcanic range appearing at intervals;
and still more to the southwards it is doubtless connected
with the volcanoes of Patagonia, north of the
Magellan Straits, and of Tierra del Fuego. Mr.
David Forbes considers that this great range of
volcanic mountains, lying nearly north and south,
corresponds to a line of fracture lying somewhat to
the east of the range.[8]

(d.) Other Volcanic Chains.       A similar statement in
all probability applies to the systems of volcanic mountains
of the Aleutian Isles, Kamtschatka, the Kuriles,
the Philippines, and Sunda Isles. Nor can it be
reasonably doubted that the western American coast-line
has to a great extent been determined, or marked
out, by such lines of displacement; for, as Darwin
has shown, the whole western coast of South America,
for a distance of between 2000 and 3000 miles south
[Pg 28]of the Equator, has undergone an upward movement
in very recent times       that is, within the period of
living marine shells       during which period the volcanoes
have been in activity.[9]

(e.) The Kurile Islands.       This chain may also be
cited in evidence of volcanic action along fissure lines.
It connects the volcanoes of Kamtschatka with those
of Japan, and the linear arrangement is apparent. In
the former peninsula Erman counted no fewer than
thirteen active volcanic mountains rising to heights
of 12,000 to 15,000 feet above the sea.[10] In the chain
of the Kuriles Professor John Milne counted fifty-two
well-defined volcanoes, of which nine, perhaps more,
are certainly active.[11] They are not so high as those
of Kamtschatka; but, on the other hand, they rise
from very deep oceanic waters, and have been
probably built up from the sea bottom by successive
eruptions of tuff, lava, and ash. According to the
view of Professor Milne, the volcanoes of the Kurile
chain are fast becoming extinct.

(f.) Volcanic Groups.       Besides the volcanic vents
arranged in lines, of which we have treated above,
there are a large number, both active and extinct,
which appear to be disposed in groups, or sporadically
distributed, over various portions of the earth's surface.
I say appear to be, because this sporadic
distribution may really be resolvable (at least in
some cases) into linear distribution for short distances.
Thus the Neapolitan Group, which might
[Pg 29]at first sight seem to be arranged round Vesuvius as
a centre, really resolves itself into a line of active and
extinct vents of eruption, ranging across Italy from
the Tyrrhenian Sea to the Adriatic, through Ischia,
Procida, Monte Nuovo and the Phlegræan Fields,
Vesuvius, and Mount Vultur.[12] Again, the extinct
volcanoes of Central France, which appear to form
an isolated group, indicate, when viewed in detail,
a linear arrangement ranging from north to south.[13]
Another region over which extinct craters are distributed
lies along the banks of the Rhine, above
Bonn and the Moselle; a fourth in Hungary; a fifth
in Asia Minor and Northern Palestine; and a sixth
in Central Asia around Lake Balkash. These are
all continental, and the linear distribution is not
apparent.

[1] For an interesting account of this range of volcanic islands see
Kingsley's At Last. The grandest volcanic peak is that of Guadeloupe,
rising to a height of 5000 feet above the ocean, amidst a group
of fourteen extinct craters. But the most active vent of the range is
the Souffrière of St. Vincent. In the eruption of 1812 this mountain
sent forth clouds of pumice, scoriæ and ashes, some of which were
carried by an upper counter current to Barbados, one hundred miles to
the eastward, covering the surface with volcanic dust to a depth of
several inches.

[2] An excellent, and perhaps the most recent, map of this kind is that
given by Professor Prestwich in his Geology, vol. i. p. 216. One on a
larger scale is that by Keith Johnston in his Physical Atlas.

found the summit covered with sulphur, and from a cone fumes at a
high temperature issued forth, but there was no eruption.       Journ. Roy.

be 16,515 feet.

[7] The arrangement of the volcanoes of Peru and Bolivia is also suggestive
of a double line of fissure, while those of Chili suggest one
single line. The volcanoes of Arequipa, in the southern part of Peru,
are dealt with by Dr. F. H. Hatch, in his inaugural dissertation,
Ueber die Gesteine der Vulcan-Gruppe von Arequipa (Wien, 1886).
The volcanoes rise to great elevations, having their summits capped by
snow. The volcano of Charchani, lying to the north of Arequipa,
reaches an elevation of 18,382 Parisian feet. That of Pichupichu
reaches a height of 17,355 Par. feet. The central cone of Misti has
been variously estimated to range from 17,240 to 19,000 Par. feet.
The rocks of which the mountains are composed consist of varieties of
andesite.

CHAPTER IV.

MID-OCEAN VOLCANIC ISLANDS.


Oceanic Islands.       By far the most extensive regions
with sporadically distributed volcanic vents, both
active and extinct, are those which are overspread
by the waters of the ocean, where the vents emerge
in the form of islands. These are to be found
in all the great oceans, the Atlantic, the Pacific, and
the Indian; but are especially numerous over the
central Pacific region. As Kotzebue and subsequently
Darwin have pointed out, all the islands of
the Pacific are either coral-reefs or of volcanic origin;
and many of these rise from great depths; that is to
say, from depths of 1000 to 2000 fathoms. It is
unnecessary here to attempt to enumerate all these
islands which rise in solitary grandeur from the surface
of the ocean, and are the scenes of volcanic operations;
a few may, however, be enumerated.

[Pg 31]



  



Fig. 4.       The Peak of Teneriffe (Pic de Teyde) as seen from the ocean.       (From a photograph.)




(a.) Iceland.       In the Atlantic, Iceland first claims
notice, owing to the magnitude and number of its
active vents and the variety of the accompanying
phenomena, especially the geysers. As Lyell has
observed,[1] with the exception of Etna and Vesuvius,
the most complete chronological records of a series of
[Pg 32]eruptions in existence are those of Iceland, which
come down from the ninth century of our era, and
which go to show that since the twelfth century there
has never been an interval of more than forty years
without either an eruption or a great earthquake.
So intense is the volcanic energy in this island that
some of the eruptions of Hecla have lasted six years
without cessation. Earthquakes have often shaken
the whole island at once, causing great changes in
the interior, such as the sinking down of hills, the
rending of mountains, the desertion by rivers of their
channels, and the appearance of new lakes. New
islands have often been thrown up near the coast,
while others have disappeared. In the intervals
between the eruptions, innumerable hot springs
afford vent to the subterranean heat, and solfataras
discharge copious streams of inflammable
matter. The volcanoes in different parts of the
island are observed, like those of the Phlegræan
Fields, to be in activity by turns, one vent serving for
a time as a safety-valve for the others. The most
memorable eruption of recent years was that of
Skaptár Jokul in 1783, when a new island was thrown
up, and two torrents of lava issued forth, one 45 and
the other 50 miles in length, and which, according to
the estimate of Professor Bischoff, contained matter
surpassing in magnitude the bulk of Mont Blanc.
One of these streams filled up a large lake, and,
entering the channel of the Skaptâ, completely dried
up the river. The volcanoes of Iceland may be considered
as safety-valves to the region in which lie the
British Isles.

(b.) The Azores, Canary, and Cape de Verde Groups.       This
group of volcanic isles rises from deep Atlantic
[Pg 33]waters north of the Equator, and the vents of eruption
are partially active, partially dormant, or extinct. It
must be supposed, however, that at a former period
volcanic action was vastly more energetic than at
present; for, except at the Grand Canary, Gomera,
Forta Ventura, and Lancerote, where various non-volcanic
rocks are found, these islands appear to have
been built up from their foundations of eruptive
materials. The highest point in the Azores is the
Peak of Pico, which rises to a height of 7016 feet
above the ocean. But this great elevation is surpassed
by that of the Peak of Teneriffe (or Pic de
Teyde) in the Canaries, which attains to an elevation
of 12,225 feet, as determined by Professor Piazzi
Smyth.[2]

This great volcanic cone, rising from the ocean,
its summit shrouded in snow, and often protruding
above the clouds, must be an object of uncommon
beauty and interest when seen from the deck of a
ship. (Fig. 4.) The central cone, formed of trachyte,
pumice, obsidian, and ashes, rises out of a vast caldron
of older basaltic rocks with precipitous inner walls       much
as the cone of Vesuvius rises from within the
partially encircling walls of Somma. (Fig. 5.) From
the summit issue forth sulphurous vapours, but no
flame.

Piazzi Smyth, who during a prolonged visit to this
mountain in 1856 made a careful survey of its form
and structure, shows that the great cone is surrounded
by an outer ring of basalt enclosing two foci of eruption,
[Pg 34]the lavas from which have broken through the ring
of the outer crater on the western side, and have
poured down the mountain. At the top of the peak
its once active crater is filled up, and we find a
convex surface ("The Plain of Rambleta") surmounted
towards its eastern end by a diminutive
cone, 500 feet high, called "Humboldt's Ash Cone."
The slope of the great cone of Teneriffe ranges from
28° to 38°; and below a level of 7000 feet the general
slope of the whole mountain down to the water's edge
varies from 10° to 12° from the horizontal. The great
cone is penetrated by numerous basaltic dykes.

The Cape de Verde Islands, which contain beds of
limestone along with volcanic matter, possess in the
island of Fuego an active volcano, rising to a height
of 7000 feet above the surface of the ocean. The
central cone, like that of Teneriffe, rises from within
an outer crater, formed of basalt alternating with beds
of agglomerate, and traversed by numerous dykes of
lava. This has been broken down on one side like
that of Somma; and over its flanks are scattered
numerous cones of scoriæ, the most recent dating
from the years 1785 and 1799.[3]

[Pg 35]



  



Fig. 5.       View of the summit of the Peak of Teneriffe (12,225 feet) and of the secondary crater, or outer ring
of basaltic sheets which surrounds its base; seen from the east.       (After Leopold von Buch.)




The volcanoes of Lancerote have a remarkably
linear arrangement from west to east across the
island. They are not yet extinct; for an eruption
in 1730 destroyed a large number of villages, and
covered with lava the most fertile tracts in the island,
which at the time of Leopold von Buch's visit lay
waste and destitute of herbage.[4] In the island of
Palma there is one large central crater, the Caldera
de Palma, three leagues in diameter, the walls of
[Pg 36]which conform closely to the margin of the coast.
Von Buch calls this crater "une merveille de la
nature," for it distinguishes this isle from all the
others, and renders it one of the most interesting and
remarkable amongst the volcanic islands of the ocean.
The outer walls are formed of basaltic sheets, and
towards the south this great natural theatre is connected
with the ocean by a long straight valley,
called the "Barranco de los Dolores," along whose
sides the structure of the mountain is deeply laid
open to view. The outer flanks of the crater are
furrowed by a great number of smaller barrancos
radiating outward from the rim of the caldera. Von
Buch regards the barrancos as having been formed
during the upheaval of the island, according to his
theory of the formation of such mountains (the elevation-theory);
but unfortunately for his views, these
ravines widen outwards from the centre, or at least do
not become narrower in that direction, as would be
the case were the elevation-theory sound. The maps
which accompany Von Buch's work are remarkably
good, and were partly constructed by himself.

(c.) Volcanic Islands in the Atlantic south of the
Equator.       The island of Ascension, formed entirely of
volcanic matter, rises from a depth of 2000 fathoms
in the very centre of the Atlantic. As described by
Darwin, the central and more elevated portions are
formed of trachytic matter, with obsidian and laminated
ash beds. Amongst these are found ejected
masses of unchanged granite, fragments of which
have been torn from the central pipe during
periods of activity, and would seem to indicate a
granitic floor, or at least an original floor upon which
more recent deposits may have been superimposed.
[Pg 37]In St. Helena we seem, according to Daubeny, to
have the mere wreck of one great crater, no one
stream of lava being traceable to its source, while
dykes of lava are scattered in profusion throughout
the whole substance of the basaltic masses which
compose the island. Tristan da Cunha, in the centre
of the South Atlantic, rises abruptly from a depth of
12,150 feet, at a distance of 1500 miles from any
land; and one of its summits reaches an elevation
of 7000 feet, being a truncated cone composed of
alternating strata of tuff and augitic lava, surrounding
a crater in which is a lake of pure water. The
volcano is extinct or dormant.

Were the waters of the ocean to be drawn off,
these volcanic islands would appear like stupendous
conical mountains, far loftier, and with sides more
precipitous, than any to be found on our continental
lands, all of which rise from platforms of considerable
elevation. The enormous pressure of the water
on their sides enables these mid-oceanic islands to
stand with slopes varying from the perpendicular
to a smaller extent than if they were sub-aerial;
and it is on this account that we find them rising
with such extraordinary abruptness from the "vasty
deep."

(d.) Volcanic Islands of the Pacific.       The volcanic
islands of this great ocean are scattered over a wide
tract on both sides of the equator. Those to the
north of this line include the Sandwich Islands,
the Mariana or Ladrone Islands, South Island, and
Bonin Sima; south of the equator, the Galapagos,
New Britain, Salomon, Santa Cruz, New Hebrides,
the Friendly and Society Isles. While the coral
reefs and islands of the Pacific may be recognised
[Pg 38]by their slight elevation above the surface of the
waters, those of volcanic origin and containing active
or extinct craters of eruption generally rise into
lofty elevations, so that the two kinds are called
the Low Islands and High Islands respectively.
Amongst the group are trachytic domes such as
the Mountain of Tobreonu in the Society Islands,
rising to a height probably not inferior to that of
Etna, with extremely steep sides, and holding a
lake on its summit.[5] The linear arrangement of some
of the volcanic islands of the Pacific is illustrated
by those of the Tonga, or Friendly, Group, lying to
the north of New Zealand. They consist of three
divisions       (1) the volcanic; (2) those formed of
stratified volcanic tuff, sometimes entirely or partially
covered by coralline limestone; and (3) those which
are purely coralline. The first form a chain of lofty
cones and craters, lying in a E.N.E. and W.S.W.
direction, and rising from depths of over 1000
fathoms. Mr. J. J. Lister, who has described the
physical characters of these islands, has shown very
clearly that they lie along a line       probably that of a
great fissure       stretching from the volcanic island of
Amargura on the north (lat. 18° S.), through Lette,
Metis, Kao (3030 feet), Tofua, Falcon, Honga Tonga,
and the Kermadec Group into the New Zealand
chain on the south. Some of these volcanoes are in
a state of intermittent activity, as in the case of
Tofua (lat. 20° 30' S.), Metis Island, and Amargura;
the others are dormant or extinct. The whole
group appears to have been elevated at a recent
period, as some of the beds of coral have been
raised 1272 feet and upward above the sea-level,
[Pg 39]as in the case of Eua Island.[6] The greater number
of the Pacific volcanoes appear to be basaltic;
such as those of the Hawaiian Group, which have
been so fully described by Professor J. D. Dana.[7]
Here fifteen volcanoes of the first class have been
in brilliant action; all of which, except three, are
now extinct, and these are in Hawaii the largest
and most eastern of the group. This island contains
five volcanic mountains, of which Kea, 13,805
feet, is the highest; next to that, Loa, 13,675 feet;
after these, Hualalai, rising 8273 feet; Kilauea,
4158 feet; and Kohala, 5505 feet above the sea; this
last is largely buried beneath the lavas of Mauna Kea.
The group contains a double line of volcanoes, one
lying to the north and west of the other; and as the
highest of the Hawaiian Group rises from a depth in
the ocean of over 2000 fathoms, the total elevation
of this mountain from its base on the bed of the
ocean is not far from 26,000 feet, an elevation about
that of the Himalayas. Mauna Kea has long been
extinct, Hualalai has been dormant since 1801; but
Mauna Loa is terribly active, there having been
several eruptions, accompanied by earthquakes, within
recent years, the most memorable being those of
1852 and 1868. In the former case the lava rose
from the deep crater into "a lofty mountain," as
described by Mr. Coan,[8] and then flowed away eastward
for a distance of twenty miles. The interior of
[Pg 40]the crater consists of a vast caldron, surrounded by a
precipice 200 to 400 feet in depth, with a circumference
of about fifteen miles, and containing within
it a second crater, bounded by a black ledge with a
steep wall of basalt       a crater within a crater; and from
the floor of the inner crater, formed of molten basalt,
in a seething and boiling state, arise a large number
of small cones and pyramids of lava, some emitting
columns of grey smoke, others brilliant flames and
streams of molten lava, presenting a wonderful spectacle,
the effect of which is heightened by the constant
roaring of the vast furnaces below.[9]

PART II.

EUROPEAN VOLCANOES.




CHAPTER I.

VESUVIUS.


Having now dealt in a necessarily cursory manner
with volcanoes of distant parts of the globe, we may
proceed to the consideration of the group of active
volcanoes which still survive in Europe, as they possess
a special interest, not only from their proximity and
facility of access, at least to residents in Europe and
the British Isles, but from their historic incidents;
and in this respect Vesuvius, though not by any means
the largest of the group, stands the first, and demands
more special notice. The whole group rises from the
shores of the Mediterranean, and consists of Vesuvius,
Etna, Stromboli, one of the Lipari Islands, and
Vulcano, a mountain which has given the name to all
mountains of similar origin with itself.[1] Along with
these are innumerable cones and craters of extinct or
dormant volcanoes, of which a large number have
been thrown out on the flanks of Etna.

(a.) Prehistoric Ideas regarding the Nature of this
Mountain.[Pg 42]       Down to the commencement of the
Christian era this mountain had given no ostensible
indication that it contained within itself a powerful
focus of volcanic energy. True, that some vague
tradition that the mountain once gave forth fire
hovered around its borders; and several ancient
writers, amongst them Diodorus Siculus and Strabo,
inferred from the appearances of the higher parts of
the mountain and the character of the rocks, which
were "cindery and as if eaten by fire," that the
country was once in a burning state, "being full of
fiery abysses, though now extinct from want of fuel."
Seneca (B.C. 1 to A.D. 64) had detected the true
character of Vesuvius, as "having been a channel for
the internal fire, but not its food;" nevertheless, at
this period the flanks of the mountain were covered
by fields and vineyards, while the summit, partially
enclosed with precipitous walls of the long extinct
volcano, Somma, was formed of slaggy and scoriaceous
material, with probably a covering of scrub.
Here it was that the gladiator Spartacus (B.C. 72),
stung by the intolerable evils of the Roman
Government, retreated to the very summit of the
mountain with some trusty followers. Clodius the
Prætor, according to the narration of Plutarch, with
a party of three thousand men, was sent against them,
and besieged them in a mountain (meaning Vesuvius
or Somma) having but one narrow and difficult
passage, which Clodius kept guarded; all the rest
was encompassed with broken and slippery precipices,
but upon the top grew a great many wild vines;
the besieged cut down as many as they had need of,
and twisted them into ladders long enough to reach
from thence to the bottom, by which, without any
danger, all got down except one, who stayed behind
to throw them their arms, after which he saved
himself with the rest.[2] "On the top" must (as
Professor Phillips observes) be interpreted the summit
of the exterior slope or crater edge, which would
appear from the narrative to have broken down on
one side, affording an entrance and mode of egress
by which Spartacus fell upon, and surprised, the
negligent Clodius Glabrus.

[Pg 43]



  



Fig. 6.       Probable aspect of Vesuvius as it appeared at the beginning of the Christian era; seen from the Bay of Naples.




[Pg 44]In fancied security, villas, temples, and cities had
been erected on the slopes of the mountain. Herculaneum,
Pompeii, and Stabiæ, the abodes of art,
luxury, and vice, had sprung up in happy ignorance
that they "stood on a volcano," and that their prosperity
was to have a sudden and disastrous close.[3]

(b.) Premonitory Earthquake Shocks.       The first
monitions of the impending catastrophe occurred in
the 63rd year after Christ, when the whole Campagna
was shaken by an earthquake, which did much damage
to the towns and villas surrounding the mountain
even beyond Naples. This was followed by other
shocks; and in Pompeii the temple of Isis was so
much damaged as to require reconstruction, which
was undertaken and carried out by a citizen at his
own expense.[4] These earthquake shakings continued
[Pg 45]for sixteen years. At length, on the night of August
24th, A.D. 79, they became so violent that the whole
region seemed to reel and totter, and all things
appeared to be threatened with destruction. The next
day, about one in the afternoon, there was seen to
rise in the direction of Vesuvius a dense cloud, which,
after ascending from the summit of the mountain
into the air for a certain height in one narrow, vertical
trunk, spread itself out laterally in such a form that
the upper part might be compared to the cluster of
branches, and the lower to the stem of the pine which
forms so common a feature in the Italian landscape.[5]

(c.) Pliny's Letters to Tacitus.       For an account of
what followed we are indebted to the admirable
letters of the younger Pliny, addressed to
the historian Tacitus, recounting the events which
caused, or accompanied, the death of his uncle, the
elder Pliny, who at the time of this first eruption of
Vesuvius was in command of the Roman fleet at the
entrance to the Bay of Naples. These letters, which
are models of style and of accurate description, are too
long to be inserted here; but he recounts how the
dense cloud which hung over the mountain spread
over the whole surrounding region, sometimes illuminated
by flashes of light more vivid than lightning;
how showers of cinders, stones, and ashes fell in
such quantity that his uncle had to flee from Stabiæ,
and that even at so great a distance as Misenum
they encumbered the surface of the ground; how the
ground heaved and the bed of the sea was upraised;
how the cloud descended on Misenum, and even the
island of Capreæ was concealed from view; and
[Pg 46]finally, how, urged by a friend who had arrived from
Spain, he, with filial affection, supported the steps of
his mother in flying from the city of destruction.
Such being the condition of the atmosphere and the
effects of the eruption at a point so distant as Cape
Misenum, some sixteen geographical miles from the
focus of eruption, it is only to be expected that
places not half the distance, such as Herculaneum,
Pompeii, and even Stabiæ, with many villages and
dwellings, should have shared a worse fate. The first
of these cities, situated on the coast of the Bay of
Naples, appears to have been overwhelmed by
volcanic mud; Pompeii was buried in ashes and
lapilli, and Stabiæ probably shared a similar fate.[6]

(d.) Appearance of the Mountain at the Commencement
of the Christian Era.       At the time of the first
recorded eruption Vesuvius appears to have consisted
of only a single cone with a crater, now known as
[Pg 47]Monte di Somma, the central cone of eruption which
now rises from within this outer ruptured casing not
having been formed. (Fig. 6.) The first effect of the
eruption of the year 79 was to blow out the solidified
covering of slag and scoriæ forming the floor of the
caldron. Doubtless at the close of the eruption a cone
of fragmental matter and lava of some slight elevation
was built up, and, if so, was subsequently destroyed;
for, as we shall presently see by the testimony of the
Abate Guilio Cesare Braccini, who examined the
mountain not long before the great eruption of A.D.
1631, there was no central cone to the mountain at
that time; and the mountain had assumed pretty
much the appearance it had at the time that Spartacus
took refuge within the walls of the great crater.

(e.) Destruction of Pompeii.       Pompeii was overwhelmed
with dry ashes and lapilli. Sir W. Hamilton
found some of the stones to weigh eight pounds. At
the time of the author's visit, early in April 1872, the
excavations had laid open a section about ten feet
deep, chiefly composed of alternating layers of small
pumice stones (lapilli) and volcanic dust. It was
during the sinking of a well in 1713 upon the theatre
containing the statues of Hercules and Cleopatra that
the existence of the ancient city was accidentally
discovered.

(f.) More recent eruptions.       Since the first recorded
eruption in A.D. 79 down to the present day, Vesuvius
has been the scene of numerous intermittent eruptions,
of which some have been recorded; but many, doubtless,
are forgotten.

In A.D. 203, during the reign of Severus, an eruption
of extraordinary violence took place, which is
related by Dion Cassius, from whose narrative we
[Pg 48]may gather that at this time there was only one
large crater, and that the central cone of Vesuvius
had not as yet been upraised. In A.D. 472 an eruption
occurred of such magnitude as to cover all Europe
with fine dust, and spread alarm even at Constantinople.

(g.) Eruption of 1631.       In December 1631 occurred
the great convulsion whose memorials are written widely
on the western face of Vesuvius in ruined villages. This
eruption left layers of ashes over hundreds of miles of
country, or heaps of mud swept down by hot water
floods from the crater; the crater itself having been
dissipated in the convulsion. Braccini, who examined
the mountain not long before this eruption, found
apparently no cone (or mount) like that of the modern
Vesuvius. He states that the crater was five miles in
circumference, about a thousand paces deep (or in
sloping descent), and its sides covered with forest
trees and brushwood, while at the bottom there was a
plain on which cattle grazed.[7] It would seem that
the mountain had at this time enjoyed a long interval
of rest, and that it had reverted to very much the
same state in which it was at the period of the first
eruption, when the flanks were peopled by inhabitants
living in fancied security. But six months of violent
earthquakes, which grew more violent towards the close
of 1631, heralded the eruption which took place in
December, accompanied by terrific noises from within
the interior of the mountain. The inhabitants of the
coast were thus warned of the approaching danger,
and had several days to arrange for their safety; but
in the end, a great part of Torre del Greco was
destroyed, and a like fate overtook Resina and
[Pg 49]Granatello, with a loss of life reported at 18,000
persons. During the eruption clouds condensed into
tempests of rain, and hot water from the mountain,
forming deluges of mud, swept down the sides, and
reached even to Nola and the Apennines. Nor was
the sea unmoved. It retired during the violent earthquakes,
and then returned full thirty paces beyond
its former limits.

Not indeed until near the close of the seventeenth
century is there any evidence that the central cone of
Vesuvius was in existence; but in October 1685 an
eruption occurred which is recorded by Sorrentino,
during which was erected "a new mountain within,
and higher than the old one, and visible from Naples,"
a statement evidently referable to the existing cone       so
that it is little more than two centuries since this
famous volcanic mountain assumed its present form.

(h.) Eruptions between the years 1500 and 1800.       Since
A.D. 1500 there have been fifty-six recorded
eruptions of Vesuvius; one of these in 1767 was of
terrific violence and destructiveness, and is represented
by Sir William Hamilton in views taken both before
and during the eruption. A pen-and-ink drawing of
the appearance of the crater before the eruption is here
reproduced from Hamilton's picture, from which it
will be seen that the central crater contained within
itself a second crater-cone, from whence steam, lava,
and stones were being erupted (Fig. 7). Thus it will
be seen that Vesuvius at this epoch consisted of three
crater-cones within each other. The first, Monte di
Somma; the second, the cone of Vesuvius; and the
third, the little crater-cone within the second. During
this eruption, vast lava-sheets invaded the fields and
vineyards on the flanks of the mountain. A vivid
[Pg 50]account of this eruption, as witnessed by Padre Torre,
is given by Professor Phillips.[8] We shall pass over
others without further reference until we come down
to our own times, in which Vesuvius has resumed its
old character, and in one grand exhibition of volcanic
energy, which took place in 1872, has evinced to the
world that it still contains within its deep-seated
laboratory all the elements of destructive force which
it exhibited at the commencement of our era.

(i.) Structure of the Neapolitan Campagna.       But before
giving a description of this terrific outburst of volcanic
energy, it may be desirable to give some account
of the physical position and structure of this mountain,
by which the phenomena of the eruption will be better
[Pg 51]understood. Vesuvius and the Neapolitan Campagna
are formed of volcanic materials bounded on the west
by the Gulf of Naples, and on the east and south by
ranges of Jurassic limestone, a prolongation of the
Apennines, which send out a spur bounding the bay on
the south, and forming the promontory of Sorrento.
The little island of Capri is also formed of limestone,
and is dissevered from the promontory by a narrow
channel. The northern side of the bay is, however,
formed of volcanic materials; it includes the
Phlegræan Fields (Campi Phlegræi), and terminates
in the promontory of Miseno. Lying in the same
direction are the islands of Procida and Ischia, also
volcanic. Hence it will be seen that the two horns
of the bay are formed of entirely different materials,
that of Miseno on the north being volcanic, that of
Sorrento on the south being composed of Jurassic
limestone, of an age vastly more ancient than the
volcanic rocks on the opposite shore. (Map, p. 52.)

The general composition of the Neapolitan
Campagna, from which the mountain rises, has
been revealed by means of the Artesian well sunk to
a depth of about 500 metres (1640 feet) at the Royal
Palace of Naples, and may be generalised as
follows:

From the above section, for which we are indebted to
Mr. Johnston-Lavis, the most recent writer on Vesuvius,
it would appear that the first volcanic explosions by
which the mountain was ultimately to be built up
took place after the deposition of the sands and
marls (No. 2), while the whole Campagna was submerged
under the waters of the Mediterranean. By
the accumulation of the stratified tuff (No. 1), the sea-bed
was gradually filled up during a period of volcanic
activity, and afterwards elevated into dry land.[9]

(j.) Present Form and Structure of Vesuvius and
Somma.       The outer cone of Vesuvius, or Monte di
Somma, rises from a circular platform by a moderately
gentle ascent, and along the north and east terminates
[Pg 54]in a craggy crest, with a precipitous cliff descending
into the Atria del Cavallo, forming the wall of the
ancient crater throughout half its circumference; this
wall is formed of scoriæ, ashes, and lapilli, and is
traversed by numerous dykes of lava. Along the
west and south this old crater has been broken
down; but near the centre there remains a round-backed
ridge of similar materials, once doubtless a
part of the original crater of Somma, rising above
the slopes of lava on either hand. On this has been
erected the Royal Observatory, under the superintendence
of Professor Luigi Palmieri, where continuous
observations are being made, by means of delicate
seismometers, of the earth-tremors which precede or
accompany eruptions; for it is only justice to say that
Vesuvius gives fair warning of impending mischief,
and the instruments are quick to notify any premonitory
symptoms of a coming catastrophe. The elevation
of the Observatory is 2080 feet above the sea.

On either side of the Observatory ridge are wide
channels filled to a certain height with lavas of the
nineteenth and preceding centuries, the most recent
presenting an aspect which can only be compared to
a confused multitude of black serpents and pachyderms
writhing and interlocked in some frightful
death-struggle. Some of this lava, ten years old, as
we cross its rugged and black surface presents gaping
fissures, showing the mass to be red-hot a few feet
from the surface, so slow is the process of cooling.
These lava-streams       some of them reaching to the
sea-coast       have issued forth from the Atria at
successive periods of eruption.

From the midst of the Atria rises the central
cone, formed of cinders, scoriæ, and lava-streams, and
[Pg 55]fissured along lines radiating from the axis. This
cone is very steep, the angle being about 40°-45°
from the horizontal, and is formed of loose cindery
matter which gives way at every step, and is rather
difficult to climb. But on reaching the summit we
look down into the crater, displaying a scene of ever-varying
characters, rather oval in form, and about
1100 yards in diameter. From the map of Professor
Guiscardi, published in 1855, there are seen two
minor craters within the central one, formed in 1850,
and an outflow of lava from the N.W. down the
cone. At the time of the author's visit the crater
was giving indications, by the great quantity of sulphurous
gas and vapour rising from its surface, and
small jets of molten lava beginning to flow down
the outer side, of the grand outburst of internal
forces which was presently to follow.

(k.) Eruption of 1872.       The grand eruption of
1872, of which a detailed account is given by Professor
Palmieri,[10] commenced with a slight discharge of incandescent
projectiles from the crater; and on the
13th January an aperture appeared on the upper edge
of the cone from which at first a little lava issued
forth, followed by the uprising of a cone which
threw out projectiles accompanied by smoke, whilst
the central crater continued to detonate more loudly
and frequently. This little cone ultimately increased
in size, until in April it filled the whole crater and
rose four or five metres above the brim. At this
time abundant lavas poured down from the base of
the cone into the Atria del Cavallo, thence turned
into the Fossa della Vetraria in the direction of the
[Pg 56]Observatory and towards the Crocella, where they
accumulated to such an extent as to cover the hillside
for a distance of about 300 metres; then turning
below the Canteroni, formed a hillock without spreading
much farther.

In October another small crater was formed by the
falling in of the lava, which after a few days gave vent
to smoke and several jets of lava; and towards the
end of October the detonations increased, the smoke
from the central crater issued forth more densely
mixed with ashes, and the seismographical apparatus
was much disturbed. On the 3rd and 4th November
copious and splendid lava-streams coursed down the
principal cone on its western side, but were soon
exhausted; and in the beginning of 1872 the little
cone, regaining vigour, began to discharge lava from
the summit instead of the base as heretofore.

In the month of March 1873, with the full moon,
the cone opened on the north-west side       the cleavage
being indicated by a line of fumaroles       and lava
issued from the base and poured down into the Atria
as far as the precipices of Monte di Somma. On the
23rd April (another full moon) the activity of the
craters increased, and on the evening of the 24th
splendid lava-streams descended the cone in various
directions, attracting on the same night the visits of
a great many strangers. A lamentable event followed
on the 26th. A party of visitors, accompanied by
inexperienced guides, and contrary to the advice of
Professor Palmieri, insisted on ascending to the place
from which the lava issued. At half-past three on the
morning of the 26th they were in the Atria del Cavallo,
when the Vesuvian cone was rent in a north-west
direction and a copious torrent of lava issued forth.
[Pg 57]Two large craters formed at the summit of the
mountain, discharging incandescent projectiles and
ashes. A cloud of smoke enveloped the unhappy
visitors, who were under a hail-storm of burning
projectiles. Eight were buried beneath it, or in
the lava, while eleven were grievously injured.[11]
The lava-stream, flowing over that of 1871 in the
Atria, divided into two branches, the smaller one
flowing towards Resina, but stopping before reaching
the town; the larger precipitated itself into the Fossa
della Vetraria, occupying the whole width of 800
metres, and traversing the entire length of 1300
metres in three hours. It dashed into the Fossa di
Farone, and reached the villages of Massa and St.
Sebastiano, covering a portion of the houses, and, continuing
its course through an artificial foss, or trench,
invaded cultivated ground and several villages. If it
had not greatly slackened after midnight, from failure
of supply at its source, it would have reached Naples
by Ponticelli and flowed into the sea. The eruption
towards the end of April had reached its height. The
Observatory ridge was bounded on either side by two
fiery streams, which rendered the heat intolerable.
Simultaneously with the opening of the great fissure
two large craters opened at the summit, discharging
with a dreadful noise an immense cloud of smoke and
ashes, with bombs which rose to a height of 1300
metres above the brim of the volcano.[12] The torrents
of fire which threatened Resina, Bosco, and Torre
Annunziata, and which devastated the fertile country
[Pg 58]of Novelle, Massa, St. Sebastiano, and Cerole, and
two partially buried cities, the continual thunderings
and growling of the craters, caused such terror, that
numbers abandoned their dwellings, flying for refuge
into Naples, while many Neapolitans went to Rome
or other places. Fortunately, the paroxysm had now
passed, the lava-streams stopped in their course, and
the great torrent which passed the shoulders of the
Observatory through the Fossa della Vetraria lowered
the level of its surface below that of its sides, which
appeared like two parallel ramparts above it. Had
these streams continued to flow on the 27th of April
as they had done on the previous night, they would
have reached the sea, bringing destruction to the very
walls of Naples. During this eruption Torre del
Greco was upraised to the extent of two metres, and
nearly all the houses were knocked down.

The igneous period of eruption having terminated,
the ashes, lapilli, and projectiles became more
abundant, accompanied by thunder and lightning.
On the 28th they darkened the air, and the terrific
noise of the mountain continuing or increasing, the
terror at Resina, Portici, and Naples became universal.
It seemed as though the tragic calamities
of the eruption of A.D. 79 were about to be repeated.
But gradually the force of the explosions decreased,
and the noise from the crater became discontinuous,
so that on the 30th the detonations were very few,
and by the 1st May the eruption was completely
over.

Such is a condensed account of one of the most
formidable eruptions of our era. In the frontispiece
of this volume a representation, taken (by permission)
from a photograph by Negretti       Zambra, is given,
[Pg 59]showing the appearance of Vesuvius during the final
stage of the eruption, when prodigious masses of
smoke, steam, and illuminated gas issued forth from
the summit and overspread the whole country around
with a canopy which the light of the sun could
scarcely penetrate.

It will be noticed in the above account that, concurrently
with the full moon, there were two distinct
and special outbreaks of activity; one occurring in
March, the other in the month following. That the
conditions of lunar and solar attraction should have
a marked effect on a part of the earth's crust, while
under the tension of eruptive forces, is only what
might be expected. At full moon the earth is
between the sun and the moon, and at new moon
the moon is between the sun and the earth;
under these conditions (the two bodies acting in
concert) we have spring tides in the ocean, and a
maximum of attraction on the mass of the earth.
Hence the crust, which at the time referred to was
under tremendous strain, only required the addition
of that caused by the lunar and solar attractions to
produce rupture in both cases, giving rise to increased
activity, and the extrusion of lava and volatile matter.
It may, in general, be safely affirmed that low barometric
pressure on the one hand, and the occurrence
of the syzygies (when the attractions of the sun and
moon are in the same line) on the other, have had
great influence in determining the crises of eruptions
of volcanic mountains when in a state of unrest.

Contrast between the Northern and Southern Slopes.       Before
leaving Vesuvius it may be observed that
throughout all the eruptions of modern times the
northern side of the mountain, that is the old crater
[Pg 60]and flank of Somma, has been secure from the
lava-flows, and has enjoyed an immunity which does
not belong to the southern and western side. If we
look at a map of the mountain showing the direction
of the streams during the last three centuries,[13] we
observe that all the streams of that period flowed
down on the side overlooking the Bay of Naples; on
the opposite side the wall of Monte di Somma
presents an unbroken front to the lava-streams. From
this it may be inferred that one side, the west, is
weaker than the other; and consequently, when the
lava and vapours are being forced upwards, under
enormous pressure from beneath, the western side
gives way under the strain, as in the case of the
fissure of 1872, and the lava and vapours find means
of escape. From what has happened in the past it
is clear that no place on the western side of the
mountain is entirely safe from devastation by floods
of lava; while the prevalent winds tend to carry the
ashes and lapilli, which are hurled into the air, in the
same westerly direction.

crowd followed the gesture of the Egyptian, and beheld with ineffable
dismay a vast vapour shooting from the summit of Vesuvius, in the
form of a gigantic pine tree; the trunk       blackness, the branches       fire!
A fire that shifted and wavered in its hues with every moment       now
fiercely luminous, now of a dull and dying red that again blazed
terrifically forth with intolerable glare!... Then there arose on high
the shrieks of women; the men stared at each other, but were speechless.
At that moment they felt the earth shake beneath their feet;
the walls of the theatre trembled; and beyond, in the distance, they
heard the crash of falling roofs; an instant more and the mountain-cloud
seemed to roll towards them, dark and rapid; at the same time
it cast forth from its bosom a shower of ashes mixed with vast fragments
of burning stone. Over the crushing vines       over the desolate streets       over
the amphitheatre itself       far and wide, with many a mighty
splash in the agitated sea, fell that awful shower." A visit to the disinterred
city will probably produce on the mind a still more lasting and
vivid impression of the swift destruction which overtook this city.

CHAPTER II.

ETNA.


(a.) Structure of the Mountain.       Etna, unlike Vesuvius,
has ever been a burning mountain; hence it
was well known as such to classic writers before the
Christian era. The structure and features of this
magnificent mountain have been abundantly illustrated
by Elie de Beaumont,[1] Daubeny,[2] Baron von
Waltershausen,[3] and Lyell,[4] of whose writings I shall
freely avail myself in the following account, not
having had the advantage of a personal examination
of this region.

Structure of Etna.       So large is Etna that it would
enclose within its ample skirts several cones of the size
of Vesuvius. It rises to a height of nearly 11,000
feet above the waters of the Mediterranean,[5] and is
planted on a floor consisting of stratified marine
volcanic matter, with clays, sands, and limestones of
newer Pliocene age. Its base is nearly circular, and
has a circumference of 87 English miles. In ascending
[Pg 62]its flanks we pass successively over three well-defined
physical zones: the lowest, or fertile zone,
comprising the tract around the skirts of the mountain
up to a level of about 2500 feet, being well cultivated
and covered by dwellings surrounded by olive groves,
fields, vineyards, and fruit-trees; the second, or forest
zone, extending to a level of about 6270 feet, clothed
with chestnut, oak, beech, and cork trees, giving place
to pines; and the third, extending to the summit and
called "the desert region," a waste of black lava and
scoriæ with mighty crags and precipices, terminating
in a snow-clad tableland, from which rises the central
cone, 1100 feet high, emitting continually steam and
sulphurous vapours, and in the course of almost every
century sending forth streams of molten lava.

The forest zone is remarkable for the great number
of minor craters which rise up from the midst of
the foliage, and are themselves clothed with trees.
Sartorius von Waltershausen has laid down on his
map of Etna about 200 of these cones and craters,
some of which, like those of Auvergne, have been
broken down on one side. Many of these volcanoes of
second or third magnitude lie outside the forest zone,
both above and below it; such as the double hill of
Monti Rossi, near Nicolosi, formed in 1659, which
is 450 feet in height, and two miles in circumference
at its base. Sir C. Lyell observes that
these minor crater-cones present us with one of
the most delightful and characteristic scenes in
Europe. They occur of every variety of height and
size, and are arranged in picturesque groups. However
uniform they may appear when seen from
the sea or the plains below, nothing can be more
diversified than their shape when we look from above
[Pg 63]into their ruptured craters. The cones situated in
the higher parts of the forest zone are chiefly clothed
with lofty pines; while those at a lower elevation are
adorned with chestnuts, oaks, and beech trees. These
cones have from time to time been buried amidst
fresh lava-streams descending from the great crater,
and thus often become obliterated.

lavas, chiefly trachytic; b. Newer lavas, erupted (with a) before origin
of the Val del Bove; c. Scoria and lava of recent age; T. Tertiary
strata forming the foundation to the volcanic rocks. The position of
the Val del Bove before its formation is shown by the lightly-shaded
portion above B.




(b.) Val del Bove.       The most wonderful feature of
Mount Etna is the celebrated Val del Bove (Valle del
Bue), of which S. von Waltershausen has furnished a
very beautiful plate[6]       a vast amphitheatre hewn
out of the eastern flank of the mountain, just below
the snow-mantled platform. It is a physical feature
somewhat after the fashion of Monte Somma in
Vesuvius, but exceeds it in magnitude as Etna
exceeds Vesuvius. The Val del Bove is about five
miles in diameter, bounded throughout three-fourths
of its circumference by precipitous walls of ashes,
scoriæ, and lava, traversed by innumerable dykes, and
rising inwards to a height of between 3000 and 4000
[Pg 64]feet. Towards the east the cliffs gradually fall to a
height of about 500 feet, and at this side the vast
chasm opens out upon the slope of the mountain. At
the head of the Val del Bove rises the platform,
surmounted by the great cone and crater. It will
thus be seen that by means of this hollow we have
access almost to the very heart of the mountain.

What is very remarkable about the structure of this
valley is that the beds exhibit "the quâ-quâ versal
dip"       in other words, they dip away on all sides from
the centre       which has led to the conclusion that in
the centre is a focus of eruption which had become
closed up antecedently to the formation of the valley
itself. Lyell has explained this point very clearly by
showing that this focus had ceased to eject matter at
some distant period, and that the existing crater at
the summit of the mountain had poured out its lavas
over those of the extinct orifice. This was prior to
the formation of the Val del Bove itself; and the
question remains for consideration how this vast
natural amphitheatre came to be hollowed out; for
its structure shows unquestionably that it owes its
form to some process of excavation.

In the first place, it is certainly not the work of
running water, as in the case of the cañons of
Colorado; the porous matter of which the mountain
is formed is quite incapable of originating and supporting
a stream of sufficient volume to excavate and
carry away such enormous masses of matter within
the period required for the purpose. We must therefore
have recourse to some other agency. Numerous
illustrations are to be found of the explosive action of
volcanoes in blowing off either the summits of mountains,
or portions of their sides. For example, there
[Pg 65]is reason for believing that the first result of the
renewed energy of Vesuvius was to blow into the air
the upper surface of the mountain. Again, so late as
1822, during a violent earthquake in Java, a country
which has been repeatedly devastated by earthquakes
and volcanic eruptions, the mountain of Galongoon,
which was covered by a dense forest, and situated in
a fertile and thickly-peopled region, and had never
within the period of tradition been in activity, was
thus ruptured by internal forces. In the month of
July 1822, after a terrible earthquake, an explosion
was heard, and immense columns of boiling water,
mixed with mud and stones, were projected from the
mountain like a water-spout, and in falling filled up the
valleys, and covered the country with a thick deposit
for many miles, burying villages and their inhabitants.
During a subsequent eruption great blocks of basalt
were thrown to a distance of seven miles; the result
of all being that an enormous semicircular gulf was
formed between the summit and the plain, bounded
by steep cliffs, and bearing considerable resemblance
to the Val del Bove. Other examples of the power
of volcanic explosions might be cited; but the above
are sufficient to show that great hollows may thus be
formed either on the summits or flanks of volcanic
mountains. Chasms may also be formed by the
falling in of the solidified crust, owing to the extrusion
of molten matter from some neighbouring vent of
eruption; and it is conceivable that by one or other
of these processes the vast chasm of the Val del Bove
on the flanks of Etna may have been produced.

(c.) The Physical History of Etna.       The physical
history of Etna seems to be somewhat as follows:       

First Stage.       Somewhere towards the close of the
[Pg 66]Tertiary period       perhaps early Pliocene or late
Miocene       a vent of eruption opened on the floor of
the Mediterranean Sea, from which sheets of lava
were poured forth, and ashes mingled with clays and
sands, brought down from the neighbouring lands,
were strewn over the sea-bed. During a pause in
volcanic activity, beds of limestone with marine shells
were deposited.

Second Stage.       This sea-bed was gradually upraised
into the air, while fresh sheets of lava and other ejecta
were accumulated round the vents of eruption, of
which there were two principal ones       the older under
the present Val del Bove, the newer under the summit
of the principal cone. Thus was the mountain gradually
piled up.

Third Stage.       The vent under the Val del Bove
ceased to extrude more matter, and became extinct.
Meanwhile the second vent continued active, and,
piling up more and more matter round the central
crater, surmounted the former vent, and covered its
ejecta with newer sheets of lava, ashes, and lapilli,
while numerous smaller vents, scattered all over the
sides of the mountain, gave rise to smaller cones and
craters.

Fourth Stage.       This stage is signalised by the
formation of the Val del Bove through some grand
explosion, or series of explosions, by which this vast
chasm was opened in the side of the mountain, as
already explained.

Fifth Stage.       This represents the present condition
of the mountain, whose height above the sea is due,
not only to accumulation of volcanic materials round
the central cone, but to elevation of the whole island,
as evinced by numerous raised beaches of gravel and
[Pg 67]sand, containing shells and other forms of marine
species now living in the waters of the Mediterranean.[7]
Since then the condition and form of the
mountain has remained very much the same, varied
only by the results of occasional eruptions.

(d.) Dissimilarity in the Constitution of the Lavas
of Etna and Vesuvius.       Before leaving the subject we
have been considering, it is necessary that I should
mention one remarkable fact connected with the origin
of the lavas of Etna and Vesuvius respectively; I refer
to their essential differences in mineral composition.
It might at first sight have been supposed that
the lavas of these two volcanic mountains       situated
at such a short distance from each other, and evidently
along the same line of fracture in the crust       would be
of the same general composition; but such is not the
case. In the lava of Vesuvius leucite is an essential,
and perhaps the most abundant mineral. It is called
by Zirkel Sanidin-Leucitgestein. (See Plate IV.)
But in that of Etna this mineral is (as far as I am
aware) altogether absent. We have fortunately
abundant means of comparison, as the lavas of
these two mountains have been submitted to close
examination by petrologists. In the case of the
Vesuvian lavas, an elaborate series of chemical
analyses and microscopical observations have been
[Pg 68]made by the Rev. Professor Haughton, of Dublin
University, and the author,[8] from specimens collected
by Professor Guiscardi from the lava-flows extending
from 1631 to 1868, in every one of which
leucite occurs, generally as the most abundant
mineral, always as an essential constituent. On
the other hand, the composition of the lavas of
Etna, determined by Professor A. von Lasaulx, from
specimens taken from the oldest (vorätnäischen) sheets
of lava down to those of the present day, indicates
a rock of remarkable uniformity of composition, in
which the components are plagioclase felspar, augite,
olivine, magnetite, and sometimes apatite; but of
leucite we have no trace.[9] In fact, the lavas of Etna
are very much the same in composition as the ordinary
basalts of the British Isles, while those of Vesuvius
are of a different type. This seems to suggest an
origin of the two sets of lavas from a different deep-seated
magma; the presence of leucite in such large
quantity requiring a magma in which soda is in
excess, as compared with that from which the lavas
of Etna have been derived.[10]

[7] Sir William Hamilton observes that history is silent regarding the
first eruptions of Etna. It was in activity before the Trojan War, and
even before the arrival of the "Sizilien" settlers. Diodorus and
Thucydides notice the earliest recorded eruptions, those from 772 to
388 B.C., during which time the mountain was thrice in eruption.
Later eruptions took place in the year 140, 135, 125, 122 B.C. In the

In such cases the felspar crystals ought to retain the forms of leucite.

CHAPTER III.

THE LIPARI ISLANDS, STROMBOLI.


(a.) A brief account of this remarkable group of volcanic
islands must here be given, inasmuch as they seem
to be representatives of a stage of volcanic action in
which the igneous forces are gradually losing their
energy. According to Daubeny, the volcanic action in
these islands seems to be developed along two lines,
nearly at right angles to each other, one parallel to
that of the Apennines, beginning with Stromboli,
intersecting Panaria, Lipari, and Vulcano; the
other extending from Panaria to Salina, Alicudi,
and Felicudi, and again visible in the volcanic
products which make their appearance at Ustica.
(See Map, Fig. 11.) The islands lie between the
north coast of Sicily and that of Italy, and from
their position seem to connect Etna with Vesuvius;
but this is very problematical, as would appear from
the difference of their lavas. The principal islands
are those of Stromboli, Panaria, Lipari, Vulcano,
Salina, Felicudi, and Alicudi. These three last are
extinct or dormant, but Salina contains a crater, rising,
according to Daubeny, not less than 3500 feet above
the sea.[1] Vulcano (referred to by Strabo under the
name of Hiera) consists of a crater which constantly
[Pg 70]emits large quantities of sulphurous vapours, but was
in a state of activity in the year 1786, when, after
frequent earthquake shocks and subterranean noises,
it vomited forth during fifteen days showers of sand,
together with clouds of smoke and flame, altering
materially the shape of the crater from which they
proceeded.



LIPARI ISLANDS.
  



Fig. 11.       Map to show the position of these islands, showing the
branching lines of volcanic action       one parallel to that of the Apennines,
the other stretching westwards at right angles thereto.




The islands of Lipari are formed of beds of tuff,
penetrated by numerous dykes of lava, from which
uprise two or three craters, formed of pumice and
obsidian passing into trachyte. Volcanic operations
might have here been said to be extinct, were it not
that their continuance is manifested by the existence
[Pg 71]of hot springs and "stufes," or vapour baths, at St.
Calogero, about four miles from the town of Lipari.
Daubeny considers it not improbable that this island
may have had an active volcano even within the
historical period, a view which is borne out by the
statement of Strabo.[2]



  



Fig. 12.       Island of Vulcano, one of the Lipari Group, in eruption.       (After
Sir W. Hamilton.)




(b.) But by far the most remarkable island of the
group, as regards its present volcanic condition, is
Stromboli, which has ever been in active eruption from
the commencement of history down to the present day.
Professor Judd, who visited this island in 1874, and
has produced a striking representation of its aspect,[3]
gives an account of which I shall here avail myself.[4]
[Pg 72]The island is of rudely circular outline, and rises into
a cone, the summit of which is 3090 feet above the
level of the Mediterranean. From a point on the side
of the mountain masses of vapour are seen to issue,
and these unite to form a cloud over the summit; the
outline of this vapour-cloud varying continually according
to the hygrometric state of the atmosphere, and
the direction and force of the wind. At the time of
Professor Judd's visit, the vapour-cloud was spread in
a great horizontal stratum overshadowing the whole
island; but it was clearly seen to be made up of a
number of globular masses, each of which is a product
of a distinct outburst of volcanic forces. Viewed
at night-time, Stromboli presents a far more striking
and singular spectacle. When watched from the
deck of a vessel, a glow of red light is seen to
make its appearance from time to time above the
summit of the mountain; it may be observed
to increase gradually in intensity, and then as
gradually to die away. After a short interval the
same appearances are repeated, and this goes on till
the increasing light of dawn causes the phenomenon
to be no longer visible. The resemblance presented
by Stromboli to a "flashing light" on a most gigantic
scale is very striking, and the mountain has long
been known as "the lighthouse of the Mediterranean."

The mountain is built up of ashes, slag, and scoriæ,
to a height of (as already stated) over 3000 feet above
the surface of the sea; but, as Professor Judd observes,
this by no means gives a just idea of its vast bulk.
Soundings in the sea surrounding the island show
that the bottom gradually shelves around the shores
to a depth of nearly 600 fathoms, so that Stromboli is
a great conical mass of cinders and slaggy materials,
[Pg 73]having a height above its floor of about 6600 feet,
and a base the diameter of which exceeds four miles.

The crater of Stromboli is situated, not at the apex
of the cone, but at a distance of 1000 feet below it.
The explosions of steam, accompanied by the roaring
as of a smelting furnace, or of a railway engine when
blowing off its steam, are said by Judd to take place
at very irregular intervals of time, "varying from less
than one minute to twenty minutes, or even more."
On the other hand, Hoffmann describes them as
occurring at "perfectly regular intervals," so that,
perhaps, some variation has taken place within the
interval of about forty years between each observation.
Both observers agree in stating that lava is to
be seen welling up from some of the apertures within
the crater, and pouring down the slope towards the
sea, which it seldom or never reaches.[5] The intermittent
character of these eruptions appears to be
due, as Mr. Scrope has suggested, to the exact proportion
between the expansive and repressive forces;
the expansive force arising from the generation of a
certain amount of aqueous vapour and of elastic gas;
the repressive, from the pressure of the atmosphere
and from the weight of the superincumbent volcanic
products. Steam is here, as in a steam-engine, not
the originating agent in the phenomena recorded;
but the result of water coming in contact with
molten lava constantly welling up from the interior,
by which it is converted into steam, which from time
to time acquires sufficient elastic force to produce the
eruptions; the water being obviously derived from
the surrounding sea, which finds its way by filtration
through fissures, or through the porous mass of which
[Pg 74]the mountain is formed. Were it not for the access
of water this volcano would probably appear as a
fissure-cone extruding a small and continuous stream
of molten lava. The adventitious access of the sea
water gives rise to the phenomena of intermittent
explosions. The vitality of the volcano is therefore
due, not to the presence of water, but to the welling
up of matter from the internal reservoir through the
throat of the volcano.

Pantelleria.       This island, lying between the coast
of Sicily and Cape Bon in Africa, is wholly volcanic.
It has a circumference of thirty miles, and from its
centre rises an extinct crater-cone to a height of about
3000 feet. The flanks of this volcano are diversified
by several fresh craters and lava-streams, while hot
springs burst out with a hissing noise on its southern
flank, showing that molten matter lies below at no
very great depth.

This island probably lies along the dividing line
between the non-volcanic and volcanic region of the
Mediterranean, and is consequently liable to intermittent
eruptions. It was at a short distance from
this island that the remarkable submarine outburst
of volcanic forces took place on October 17th, 1891,
for an account of which we are indebted to Colonel
J. C. Mackowen.[6] On that day, after a succession of
earthquake shocks, the inhabitants were startled by
observing a column of "smoke" rising out of the sea at
a distance of three miles, in a north-westerly direction.
[Pg 75]The Governor, Francesco Valenza, having manned a
boat, rowed out towards the fiery column, and on
arriving found it to consist of black scoriaceous bombs,
which were being hurled into the air to a height of
nearly thirty yards; some of them burst in the air,
others, discharging steam, ran hissing over the water;
many of them were very hot, some even red-hot. One
of these bombs, measuring two feet in diameter, was
captured and brought to shore. It was observed that
after the eruption the earthquake shocks ceased. A
vast amount of material was cast out of the submarine
crater, forming an island 500 yards in length
and rising up to nine feet above the surface, but after
a few days it was broken up and dispersed over
the sea-bed by the action of the waves.

CHAPTER IV.

THE SANTORIN GROUP.

structure of the submerged volcano.       a. Island of Aspronisi; b. Island
of Thera; 1. Old Kaimeni Island; 2. New Kaimeni Island; 3. Little
Kaimeni Island.




(a.) Before leaving the subject of European active
volcanoes, it is necessary to give some account of the
remarkable volcanic island of Santorin, in the Grecian
archipelago. This island for 2000 years has been the
scene of active volcanic operations, and in its outline
and configuration, both below and above the surface
of the Mediterranean, presents the aspect of a
partially submerged volcanic mountain. (See Section,
Fig. 13.) If, for example, we can imagine the waters
of the sea to rise around the flanks of Vesuvius until
they have entered and overflowed to some depth the
interior caldron of Somma, thus converting the old
crater into a crescent-shaped island, and the cone of
Vesuvius into an island       or group of islands       within
[Pg 77]the caldron, then we shall form some idea of the
appearance and structure of the Santorin group.

Form of the Group.       The principal island, Thera,
has somewhat the shape of a crescent, breaking off in
a precipitous cliff on the inner side, but on the outer
side sloping at an angle of about fifteen degrees into
deep water. Continuing the curvature of the crescent,
but separated by a channel, is the island of Therasia;
and between this and the southern promontory of
Thera is another island called Aspronisi. All these
islands, if united, would form the rim of a crater, in
which the volcanic matter slopes outward into deep
water, descending at a short distance to a depth
of 200 fathoms and upwards. In the centre of the
gulf thus formed rise three islands, called the Old,
New, and Little Kaimenis. These may be regarded as
cones of eruption, which history records as having
been thrown up at successive intervals. According to
Pliny, the year 186 B.C. gave birth to Old Kaimeni,
also called Hiera, or the Sacred Isle; and in the first
year of our era Thera (the Divine) made its appearance
above the water, and was soon joined to the
older island by subsequent eruptions. Old Kaimeni
also increased in size by the eruptions of 726 and
1427. A century and a half later, in 1573, another
eruption produced the cone and crater called Micra-Kaimeni.
Thus were formed, or rather were rendered
visible above the water, the central craters of eruption;
and between these and the inner cliff of Thera
and Therasia is a ring of deep water, descending to a
depth of over 200 fathoms. So that, were these islands
raised out of the sea, we should have presented to our
view a magnificent circular crater about six miles in
diameter, bounded by nearly vertical walls of rock
[Pg 78]from 1000 to 1500 feet in height, and ruptured at one
point, from the centre of which would rise two volcanic
cones       namely, the Kaimenis       one with a double
crater, still foci of eruption, and from time to time
bursting forth in paroxysms of volcanic energy, of
which those of 1650, 1707, and 1866 were the most
violent and destructive.[1] Of this last I give a bird's-eye
view (Fig. 14).

The only rock of non-volcanic origin in these
islands consists of granular limestone and clay slate
forming the ridge of Mount St. Elias, which rises to
a height of 1887 feet at the south-eastern side of
the island of Thera, crossing the island from its
outer margin nearly to the interior cliff, so that the
volcanic materials have been piled up along its sides.
The rocks of St. Elias are much more ancient than
any of the volcanic materials around; and, as Bory
St. Vincent has shown, have been subjected to the
same flexures, dip and strike, as those sedimentary
rocks which go to form the non-volcanic islands of
the Grecian archipelago.

Ground Plan of Rocca Monfina


Fig. 15.       Rocca Monfina, in Southern Italy, showing a crater-ring
of trachytic tuffs, from the midst of which, according to Judd, an andesite
lava-cone has been built up. Compare with the Santorin Group.




(b.) Origin of the Santorin Group.       In reference to
the origin of the Santorin group, Lyell regards it
as a remnant of a great volcanic mountain which
possessed a focus of eruption rising in the position
of the present foci, but afterwards partially destroyed
and the whole submerged to a depth of over 1000
feet. But another explanation is open to us, and
one not inconsistent with what we now know of
the physical changes to which the Mediterranean has
been subjected since early Tertiary times. To my
mind it is difficult to conceive how such a volcanic
mountain as that of Santorin could have been formed
under water; while, on the other hand, its physical
structure and contour bear so striking a resemblance
(as already observed) to those of Vesuvius and Rocca
Monfina that we are much tempted to infer that it
had a somewhat similar origin. Now we know that
Vesuvius was built up by means of successive eruptions
taking place under the air; and the question arises
whether it could be possible that Santorin had a similar
origin owing to the waters of the Mediterranean
having been temporally lowered at a later Tertiary
epoch. It has been stated by M. Fouqué that the
age of the more ancient volcanic beds of Santorin
belong, as shown by the included fossils, to the
[Pg 81]newer Pliocene epoch. These are of course the
unsubmerged, and therefore more recent strata, and
may have been recently upheaved during one or more
of the outbursts of volcanic energy. But it seems
an impossibility that the Gulf of Santorin, with its
precipitous walls and deep circular interior channel,
as shown by the Ideal Section (Fig. 13), could have
been formed otherwise than under the air. We are
led, therefore, to inquire whether there was a time
in the history of the Mediterranean, since the Eocene
period, when the waters were lower than at present.
That this was the case we have clear evidence. The
remains of elephants, hippopotami, and other animals,
which have been discovered in great numbers in the
Maltese caves, show that this island was united to
Sicily, and this again to Europe, during the later
Pliocene epoch, so as to have become the abode of
an Europasian fauna. According to Dr. Wallace, a
causeway of dry land existed, stretching from Italy to
Tunis in North Africa through the Maltese Islands       an
inference involving the lowering of the waters of the
Mediterranean by several hundred feet.[2] There is
every reason for supposing that the old volcano of
Santorin was in active eruption at this period; and
its history may be considered to be similar to that of
Vesuvius until, at the rising of the waters during the
Pluvial (or Post-Pliocene) epoch, during which they
rose higher than at present, Santorin was converted
into a group of islands, slightly differing in form from
those of the present day. This view seems to meet the
difficulties regarding the origin of this group, difficulties
which Lyell had long since clearly recognised.

[Pg 82](c.) Limit of the Mediterranean Volcanic Region.       With
the Santorin group we conclude our account of
the active European volcanoes. It may be observed,
however, that from some cause not ascertained the volcanic
districts of the Mediterranean and its shores are
confined to the north side of that great inland sea; so
that as regards vulcanicity the African coast presents
a striking contrast to that of the opposite side. If we
draw a line from the shores of the Levant to the
Straits of Gibraltar, by Candia, Malta, and to the
south of Pantelleria and Sardinia, we shall find that
the volcanic islands and districts of the mainland lie
to the north of it.[3] This has doubtless some connection
with the internal geological structure. The
immunity of the Libyan desert from volcanic irruptions
is in keeping with the remarkably undisturbed
condition of the Secondary strata, which seldom
depart much from the horizontal position; while the
igneous rocks of the Atlas mountains are probably of
great geological antiquity. On the other hand, the
Secondary and Tertiary formations of the northern
shores and islands of the Mediterranean are generally
characterised by the highly-inclined, flexured, and
folded position of the strata. Hence we may
suppose that the crust over the region lying to the
north of the volcanic line, owing to its broken and
[Pg 83]ruptured condition, was less able to resist the
pressure of the internal forces of eruption than that
lying to the south of it; and that, in consequence,
vents and fissures of eruption were established over
the former of these regions, while they are absent in
the latter.

and Lyell's Principles of Geology, vol. ii. p. 65 (edition 1872). The

Sardinia, Sicily, Pantelleria, the Grecian Archipelago, Asia Minor, and
Syria; the non-volcanic area lying to the south of this line will include
the African coast, Malta, Isles of Crete and Cyprus. The Isle of
Pantelleria is apparently just on the line, which, continued eastward,
probably follows the north coast of Cyprus, parallel to the strike
of the strata and of the central axis of that island.       See "Carte
Géologique de l'île de Chypre, par MM. Albert Gaudry et Amedée
Damour" (1860).

CHAPTER V.

EUROPEAN EXTINCT OR DORMANT VOLCANOES.


We are naturally led on from a consideration of the
active volcanoes of Europe to that of volcanoes which
are either dormant or extinct in the same region.
Such are to be found in Italy, Central France,
both banks of the Rhine and Moselle, the Westerwald,
Vogelsgebirge, and other districts of Germany;
in Hungary, Styria, and the borders of the Grecian
archipelago. But the subject is too large to be
treated here in detail; and I propose to confine my
observations to some selected cases which are to be
found in Southern Italy, Central France, and the
Rhenish districts, where the volcanic features are of
so recent an age as to preserve their outward form
and structure almost intact.

(a.) Southern Italy.       Extinct volcanoes and volcanic
rocks occupy considerable tracts between the western
flanks of the Apennines and the Mediterranean coast
in the Neapolitan and Roman States, forming the
remarkable group of the Phlegræan fields (Campi
Phlegræi), with the adjoining islands of Ischia,
Procida, Nisida, Vandolena, Ponza, and Palmarola;
at Melfi and Avellino. All the region around Rome
extending along the western slopes of the Apennines
from Velletri to Orvieto, together with Mount Annato
[Pg 85]in Tuscany, is formed of volcanic material, and the
same may be said of a large part of the island of
Sardinia. From these districts I shall select some
points which seem to be of special interest.

Monte Nuovo and the Phlegræan Fields.       The tract
of which this celebrated district forms a part lies as
it were in a bay of the Apennine limestone of Jurassic
age. The floor of this bay is composed of puzzolana,
a name given to beds of volcanic tuff of great thickness,
and rising into considerable hills in the vicinity
of the city of Naples, such as that of St. Elmo. Its
composition is peculiar, as it is chiefly formed of
small pieces of pumice, obsidian, and trachyte, in beds
alternating with loam, ferriferous sand, and fragments
of limestone. It is evidently of marine formation,
as Sir William Hamilton, Professor Pilla, and others
have detected sea-shells therein, of the genera Ostræa,
Cardium, Pecten and Pectunculus, Buccinum, etc. It
is generally of a greyish colour, and sometimes
sufficiently firm to be used as a building stone. The
Roman Campagna is largely formed of similar
materials, which were deposited at a time when the
districts in question were submerged, and matter was
being erupted from volcanic vents at various points
around, and spread over the sea-bed.

Such is the character of the general floor on
which the more recent crater-cones of this district
have been built. These are numerous, and all
extinct with the exception of the Solfatara, near
Puzzuoli, from which gases mixed with aqueous
vapour are continually being exhaled. The gases
consist of sulphuretted hydrogen mixed with a minute
quantity of muriatic acid.[1] This district is also
[Pg 86]remarkable for containing several lakes occupying
the interiors of extinct craters; amongst others, Lake
Avernus, which, owing to its surface having been
darkened by forests, and in consequence of the
effluvia arising from its stagnant waters, has had
imparted to it a character of gloom and terror, so
that Homer in the Odyssey makes it the entrance to
hell, and describes the visit of Ulysses to it. Virgil
follows in his steps. Another lake of similar origin
is Lake Agnano. Here also is the Grotto del Cane,
a cavern from which are constantly issuing volumes
of carbonic acid gas combined with much aqueous
vapour, which is condensed by the coldness of the
external air, thus proving the high temperature of
the ground from which the gaseous vapour issues.
This whole volcanic region, so replete with objects
of interest,[2] may be considered, as regards its volcanic
character, in a moribund condition; but that it is
still capable of spasmodic movement is evinced by
the origin of Monte Nuovo, the most recent of the
crater-cones of the district. This mountain, rising
from the shore of the Bay of Baiæ, was suddenly
formed in September 29th, 1538, and rises to a height
of 440 feet above the sea-level. It is a crater-cone,
and the depth of the crater has been determined by
the Italian mineralogist Pini to be 421 English feet;
its bottom is thus only 19 feet above the sea-level. A
portion of the base of the cone is considered partly
to occupy the site of the Lucrine Lake, which was
itself nothing more than the crater of a pre-existent
[Pg 87]volcano, and was almost entirely filled up during the
explosion of 1538. Monte Nuovo is composed of
ashes, lapilli, and pumice-stones; and its sudden
formation, heralded by earthquakes, and accompanied
by the ejection of volcanic matter mixed with fire
and water, is recorded by Falconi, who vividly depicts
the terror and consternation of the inhabitants of the
surrounding country produced by this sudden and
terrible outburst of volcanic forces.[3]

(b.) Central Italy and the Roman States.       The tract
bordering the western slopes of the Apennines northward
from Naples into Tuscany, and including the
Roman States, is characterised by volcanic rocks and
physical features of remarkable interest and variety.
These occur in the form of extinct craters, sometimes
filled with water, and thus converted into circular
lakes; or of extensive sheets and conical hills of tuff;
or, finally, of old necks and masses of trachyte and
basalt, sometimes exhibiting the columnar structure.
The Eternal City itself is built on hills of
volcanic material which some observers have supposed
to be the crater of a great volcano; but
Ponzi, Brocchi, and Daubeny all concur in the
opinion that this is not the case, as will clearly
appear from the following account.

The geological structure of the valley of the Tiber
at Rome is very clearly described by Professor Ponzi
in a memoir published in 1850, from which the
accompanying section is taken.[4] (Fig. 16.) From
this it will be seen that "the Seven-hilled City"
[Pg 88]is built upon promontories of stratified volcanic tuff,
of which the Campagna is formed, breaking off along
the banks of the Tiber, the hills being the result of
the erosion, or denudation, of the strata along the side
of the river valley. As the strata dip from west to
east across the course of the river, it follows that
those on the western banks are below those on the
opposite side; and thus the marine sands and marls
which underlie the volcanic tuff, and are concealed
by it along the eastern side of the valley, emerge on
the west, and form the range of hills on that side.
Such being the structure of the formations under
Rome, it is evident that it is not "built on a
volcano."

1. Alluvium of the Tiber; 2. Diluvium; 3. Volcanic tuff (recent
deposits); 4. Sands, etc.; 5. Blue marl (sub-Apennine deposits).





The tuff contains fragments of lava and pebbles
of Apennine limestone, and was deposited under
the waters of an extensive lake at a time when
volcanic action was rife amidst the Alban Hills.
This lacustrine formation rests in turn on deposits
of marine origin, containing oysters, patellæ, and
other sea-shells, of which the chain of hills on the
right bank of the Tiber is chiefly formed.

The district around Albano lying to the south of
Rome is of peculiar interest from the assemblage of
old crater-lakes which it contains; as, for instance,
[Pg 89]those of Albano, Vallariccia, Nemi, Juturna, and the
lake of Gabii. The lake of Albano, one of the most
beautiful sheets of water in the world, is about six
miles in circumference, and surrounded by beds of
peperino, a variety of tuff presenting a bright, undecomposed
aspect when newly broken. The level of
this lake was lowered by the Romans during the
siege of Veii by means of a tunnel, so that the waters
are 200 feet lower than the level at which they
originally stood. In the same district is the lake of
Nemi, very regular in its circular outline; that of
Juturna lying near the foot of the Alban Hills, and
that of Ariccia lying in a deep hollow eight miles in
circumference;       all may be supposed to have been the
craters of extinct volcanoes, both by reason of their
shape and of the materials of which they are formed.
All these old craters are, however, according to
Daubeny, "only the dependencies and offshoots, as
it were, of the great extinct volcano, the traces of
which still remain upon the summit of the Alban
Hills, and which is comparable in its form to that
of Vesuvius, as it is surrounded by an outer circle
of volcanic rock comparable to that of Somma."[5]

To the north of the city of Rome are several crateriform
lakes, some of which are of great size, such as
that of Bolsena, over twenty miles in circumference,
and the Lago di Bracciano, almost as large, and lying
about twelve miles from the city. These extensive
sheets of water are surrounded by banks of tuff and
volcanic sand, in which fragments of augite, leucite,
and crystals of titanite are distributed. The town of
Viterbo is built up at the foot of a steep hill called
Monte Cimini, the lower part of which is composed
[Pg 90]of trachyte; this is surmounted by tuff, which appears
to have been ejected from an extinct crater
occupying the summit of the mountain, and now
converted into a lake called the Lake of Vico. This
crater is perfectly circular, and from its centre rises a
little conical hill covered by trees.

(c.) Physical History.       Space does not permit of a
fuller description of the remarkable volcanic features
of the tract lying along the western slope of the
Apennines; but from what has been stated it will be
clear that volcanic forces have been in operation at one
time on a grand scale in the Roman States and the
South of Tuscany, over a tract extending from Mount
Annato to Velletri and Segni.

This tract was separated from that of the Neapolitan
volcanic region by a range of limestone
hills of Jurassic age between Segni and Gaeta, a
protrusion of the Alban Hills westward; but the
general structure and physical history of both regions
are probably very similar, with the exception that the
igneous forces still retain their vitality in the more
southerly region. In the case of the Roman volcanic
district, a bay seems to have been formed about the
close of the Miocene period, bounded on all sides but
the west by hills of limestone, over whose bed strata
of marl, sandstone, and conglomerate were deposited.
This tract was converted by subsequent movements
into a fresh-water lake, and contemporaneously
volcanic operations commenced over the whole
region, and beds of tuff, often containing blocks of
rock ejected from neighbouring craters, were deposited
over those of marine origin. Meanwhile numerous
crater-cones were thrown up; and, as the land gradually
rose, the waters of the lake were drained off,
[Pg 91]leaving dry the Campagna and plain of the Tiber.
Ultimately the volcanic fires smouldered down and
died out, whether within the historic epoch or not
is uncertain; lakes were formed within the now
dormant craters, and the face of nature gradually
assumed a more placid and less forbidding aspect
over this memorable region, destined to be the site
of Rome, the Mistress of the World.

CHAPTER VI.

EXTINCT VOLCANOES OF CENTRAL FRANCE.


(a.) General Structure of the Auvergne District.       From
a granitic and gneissose platform situated near
the centre of France, and separated from the western
spurs of the Alps by the wide valley of the Rhone,
there rises a group of volcanic mountains surpassing
in variety of form and structure any similar mountain
group in Europe, and belonging to an epoch ranging
from the Middle Tertiary down almost to the present
day. This volcanic group of mountains gives rise to
several important rivers, such as the Loire, the Allier,
the Soule (a branch of the Loire), the Creuse, the
Dordogne, and the Lot; and in the Plomb du Cantal
attains an elevation of 6130 feet above the sea. Its
southern section, that of Mont Dore, the Cantal,
and the Haute Loire, is characterised by magnificent
valleys, traversing plateaux of volcanic lava, and
exhibiting the results of river erosion on a grand
scale; while its northern section, that of the Puy de
Dôme, presents to us a varied succession of volcanic
crater-cones and domes, with their extruded lava-streams,
almost as fresh and unchanged in form as
if they had only yesterday become extinct. A somewhat
similar, but less important, chain of extinct
volcanoes also occurs in the Velay and Vivarais,
[Pg 93]between the upper waters of the Loire and the
Allier, in the vicinity of the town of Le Puy.[1] The
principal city in this region is Clermont-Ferrand,
lying near the base of the Puy de Dôme, and ever
memorable as the birthplace of Blaise Pascal.[2]



  



Fig. 17.       Generalised Section through the Puy de Dôme and Vale
of Clermont, distance about ten miles. The general floor formed of
granite and gneiss (G); D. Domite-lava of the Puy de Dôme; Sc.
Cones of ashes and scoriæ; L. Lava-sheets; A. Alluvium of the Vale
of Clermont and Lake deposits.




The physical structure of this region is on the
whole very simple. The fundamental rocks consist
of granite and gneiss passing into schist, all of
extreme geological antiquity, forming a vast platform
gradually rising in a southerly direction towards
[Pg 94]the head waters of the Loire and the Allier in the
Departments of Haute Loire, Lozère, and Ardèche.
On this platform are planted the whole of the volcanic
mountains. (See Fig. 17.)

The granitic plateau is bounded on the east,
throughout a distance of about 50 miles, by the
wide and fertile plain of Clermont, watered by the
Allier and its numerous branches descending from the
volcanic mountains, and is about 25 miles in width
from east to west in the parallel of Clermont, but
gradually narrowing in a southerly direction, till
at Brioude it becomes an ordinary mountain ravine.
The eastern margin of the plain is formed by another
granitic ridge expanding into a plateau towards the
south, and joining in with that already described;
but towards the north and directly east of Clermont
it forms a high ridge traversed by the railway to St.
Étienne and Lyons, and descending towards the east
into the valley of the Loire. No more impressive
view is to be obtained of the volcanic region than
that from the summit of this second ridge, on arriving
there towards evening from the city of Lyons. At
your feet lies the richly-cultivated plain of Clermont,
dotted with towns, villages, and hamlets, and decorated
with pastures, orchards, vineyards, and numerous trees;
while beyond rises the granitic plateau, breaking off
abruptly along the margin of the plain, and deeply
indented by the valleys and gorges along which the
streams descend to join the Allier. But the chief
point of interest is the chain of volcanic crater-cones
and dome-shaped eminences which rise from the
plateau, amongst which the Puy de Dôme towers
supreme. Their individual forms stand out in clear and
sharp relief against the western sky, and gradually
[Pg 95]fade away towards the south into the serried masses
of Mont Dore and Cantal, around whose summits the
evening mists are gathering. Except the first view
of the Mont Blanc range from the crest of the Jura,
there is no scene perhaps which is calculated to
impress itself more vividly on the memory than that
here faintly described.[3]




  



Fig. 18.       Transverse view of the Puy de Dôme and neighbouring volcanoes from the Puy de Chopine.       (After Scrope.)




[Pg 96](b.) The Vale of Clermont.       The plain upon which
we look down was once the floor of an extensive lake,
for it is composed of various strata of sand, clay,
marl, and limestone, containing various genera and
species of fresh-water shells. These strata are of
great thickness, perhaps a thousand feet in some
places; and along with such shells as Paludina, Planorbis,
and Limnæa are also found remains of various
other animals, such as fish, serpents, batrachians,
crocodiles, ruminants, and those of huge pachyderms,
as Rhinoceros, Dinotherium, and Cænotherium. This
great lake, occupying a hollow in the old granitic platform
of Central France, must have been in existence
for an extensive period, which MM. Pomel, Aymard,
and Lyell all unite in referring to that of the Lower
Miocene. But what is to us of special interest is the
fact that, in the deposits of this lake of the Haute Loire,
with the exception of the very latest, there is no intermixture
of volcanic products such as might have been
expected to occur if the neighbouring volcanoes
had been in activity during its existence. Hence it
may be supposed that, as Scrope suggested, the
[Pg 97]waters of the lake were drained off owing to the
disturbance in the levels of the country caused by the
first explosions of the Auvergne volcanoes.[4] If this be
so, then we possess a key by which to determine the
period of the first formation of volcanoes in Central
France; for, as the animal remains enclosed in the
lacustrine deposits of the Vale of Clermont belong
to the early Miocene stage, and the earliest traces of
contemporaneous volcanic ejecta are found only in
the uppermost deposits, we may conclude that the
first outburst of volcanic action occurred towards the
close of the Miocene period       a period remarkable for
similar exhibitions of internal igneous action in other
parts of the world.

(c.) Successive Stages of Volcanic Action in Auvergne.       The
volcanic region here described, which has an
area of about one hundred square miles, does not
appear to have been at one and the same period of
time the theatre of volcanic action over its whole
extent. On the contrary, this action appears to have
commenced at the southern border of the region in
the Cantal, and travelling northwards, to have broken
out in the Mont Dore region; finally terminating its
outward manifestations among the craters and domes
of the Puy de Dôme. In a similar manner the volcanic
eruptions of the Haute Loire and Ardèche,
lying to the eastward, and separated from those of the
Cantal by the granitoid ridge of the Montagnes de
Margeride, belong to two successive periods referable
very closely to those of the Mont Dore and the Puy de
[Pg 98]Dôme groups.[5] The evidence in support of this view
is very clear and conclusive; for, while the volcanic
craters formed of ash, lapilli, and scoriæ, together with
the rounded domes of trachytic rock of which the
Puy de Dôme group is composed, preserve the
form and surface indications of recently extinguished
volcanoes, those which we may assume to have been
piled up in the region of Mont Dore and Cantal have
been entirely swept away by prolonged rain and river
action, and the sites of the ancient craters and cones
of eruption are only to be determined by tracing the
great sheets of lava up the sides of the valleys to their
sources, generally situated at the culminating points
of their respective groups. Other points of evidence
of the great antiquity of the latter groups might be
adduced from the extent of the erosion which has
taken place in the sheets of lava having their sources
in the vents of the Plomb du Cantal and of Mont Dore,
owing to which, magnificent valleys, many miles in
length and hundreds of feet in depth, have been cut
out of these sheets of lava and their supporting
rocks, whether granitic or lacustrine, and the materials
carried away by the streams which flow along their
beds. These points will be better understood when
I come to give an account of the several groups;
and in doing so I will commence with that of the
Cantal.[6]

(d.) The Volcanoes of the Cantal.       The original
[Pg 99]crater-cones of this group have entirely disappeared
throughout the long ages which have elapsed since the
lava-streams issued forth from their internal reservoirs.
The general figure of this group of volcanic mountains
is that of a depressed cone, whose sides slope away in
all directions from the central heights, which are
deeply eroded by streams rising near the apex and
flowing downwards in all directions towards the
circumference of the mountain, where they enter the
Lot, the Dordogne, and the Allier. The orifice of
eruption was situated at the Plomb du Cantal, formed
of solid masses of trachyte, which, owing, as Mr.
Scrope supposes, to a high degree of fluidity, were
able to extend to great distances in extensive sheets,
and were afterwards covered by repeated and widely-spread
flows of basalt; so that the trachyte towards
the margin of the volcanic area becomes less conspicuous
than the basalt by which it is more or
less concealed from view, or overlapped. Extensive
beds of tuff and breccia accompany the trachytic
masses.

Magnificent sections of the rocks are laid open to
view along the sides of the valleys, which are steep
and rock-bound. Except towards the south-west,
about Aurillac, where lacustrine strata overlie the
granite, the platform from which rises the volcanic
dome is composed of granitic or gneissose rocks.
Accompanying the lava-streams are great beds of
volcanic agglomerate, which Mr. Scrope considers to
have been formed contemporaneously with the lava
which they envelop, and to be due to torrents of
water tumultuously descending the sides of the
volcano at periods of eruption, and bearing down
immense volumes of its fragmental ejecta in company
[Pg 100]with its lava-streams.[7] Nowhere throughout
this region do beds of trachyte and basalt alternate
with one another; in all cases the basalt is the newer
of the two varieties of rock, and this is generally the
case throughout the region here described.

(e.) Volcanoes of Mont Dore.       This mountain lies to
the north of that of Cantal, and somewhat resembles
it in general structure and configuration. Like
Cantal, it is destitute of any distinct crater; all that is
left of the central focus of eruption being the solidified
matter which filled the throat of the original volcano,
and which forms a rocky mass of lava, rising in its
highest point, the Pic de Saucy, to an elevation (as
given by Ramond) of 6258 feet above the level of the
sea, thus exceeding that of the Plomb du Cantal by
128 feet. Its figure will be best understood by
supposing seven or eight rocky summits grouped
together within a circle of about a mile in diameter,
from whence, as from the apex of an irregular and
flattened cone, all the sides slope more or less
rapidly downwards, until their inclination is gradually
lost in the plain around. This dome-shaped
mass has been deeply eroded on opposite sides
by the valleys of the Dordogne and Chambon;
while it is further furrowed by numerous minor
streams.[8]

The great beds of volcanic rock, disposed as above
stated, consist of prodigious layers of scoriæ, pumice-stones,
and detritus, alternating with beds of trachyte
and basalt, which often descend in uninterrupted currents
till they reach the granite platform, and then
spread themselves for miles around. The sheets of
basalt are found to stretch to greater distances than
[Pg 101]those of trachyte, and have flowed as far as 15 or
20 miles from their orifices of eruption; while in
some cases, on the east and north sides, they have extended
as far as 25 or 30 miles from the central height.
On the other hand, a radius of about ten miles from
the centre would probably include all the streams of
trachyte;       so much greater has been the viscosity of
the basalt over the latter rock. Some portions of these
great sheets of lava, cut off by river valleys or eroded
areas from the main mass of which they once
formed a part, are found forming isolated terraces and
plateaux either on the granitic platform, or resting on
the fresh-water strata of the valley of the Allier, while
in a northern direction they overspread a large portion
of the granitic plateau from which rise the Puy de
Dôme and associated volcanic mountains. Still more
remarkable are the cases in which these lava-streams
have descended into the old river channels which
drained the granitic plateau. Thus the current which
took its origin in the Puy Gros descended into the
valley of the Dordogne, while another stream invaded
the gorge of Champeix on the eastern side.

The more ancient lava-streams just described are
invaded by currents and surmounted by cones of
eruption of more recent date, similar to those of the
Puy de Dôme group lying to the northward. Such
cones and currents, amongst which are the Puy de
Tartaret and that of Montenard, present exactly the
same characters as those of this group, to which we
shall return further on.

(f.) Volcanoes of the Haute Loire and Ardèche.       Separated
by the valley of the Allier and the granitic
ridge of La Margeride from the volcanic regions of
Cantal and Mont Dore is another volcanic region of
[Pg 102]great extent, which reaches its highest elevation in the
central points of Mont Mezen, attaining an elevation
(according to Cordier) of 5820 feet, and formed of
"clinkstone." The volcanic products of Mezen have
been erupted from one central orifice of vast size, and
consist mainly of extensive sheets of "clinkstone,"
a variety of trachytic lava, which have taken courses
mainly towards the north-west and south-east. These
great sheets, one of which appears to have covered
a space more than 26 miles in length with an average
breadth of 6 miles, thus overspreading an estimated
area of 156 square miles, has been deeply eroded by
streams draining into the Loire, along whose banks
the rocks tower in lofty cliffs; while it has also suffered
enormous denudation, by which outlying fragments
are disconnected from the main mass, and form flat-topped
hills and plateaux as far distant as Roche en
Reigner and Beauzac, at the extreme distance (as
stated above) of 26 miles from the source of
eruption.

But even more remarkable than the above are the
vast basaltic sheets which stretch away for a distance
of 30 miles by Privas almost to the banks of the
Rhône, opposite Montlimart. These have their origin
amongst the clinkstone heights of Mont Mezen, and
taking their course along the granitic plateau in a
south-easterly direction, ultimately pass over on to
the Jurassic and Cretaceous formations composing the
plateau of the Coiron, which break off in vertical cliffs
from 300 to 400 feet in height, surmounting the
slopes that rise from the banks of the Ardèche and
Escourtais rivers near Villeneuve de Bere. This is
probably one of the most extensive sheets of basalt
with which we are acquainted in the European area,
[Pg 103]and it is only a remnant of a vastly greater original
sheet.[9]

the Col; 2. Road to Brioude; 3. Croix de la Paille; 4. Orgue d'Expailly (basalt); 5. Spot where human bones were found.




[Pg 104](g.) Newer Volcanoes of the Haute Loire (the Velay
and Vivarais).       Subsequently to the formation of the
lava-streams above described, and probably after the
lapse of a lengthened period, the region of the Haute
Loire and Ardèche became the scene of a fresh outburst
of volcanic action, during which the surface of
the older lavas, or of the fundamental granite, was
covered by numerous crater-cones and lava-streams
strewn along the banks of the Allier and of the Loire
for many miles. These cones and craters are not
quite so fresh as those of the Mont Dôme group;
those of the Haute Loire being slightly earlier in
point of time, and, as Daubeny shows, belonging
to a different system. So numerous are these more
recent cones and craters that Scrope counted more
than 150 of them, and probably omitted many.

The volcanic phenomena now described have a
special interest as bearing on the question whether
man was an inhabitant of this region at the time of
these later eruptions. The question seems to be
answered in the affirmative by the discovery of a
human skull and several bones in the volcanic breccia
of Mont Demise, in company with remains of the
elephant (E. primigenius), rhinoceros (R. tichorhinus),
stag, and other large mammifers. The discovery of
these remains was made in the year 1844, and the
circumstances were fully investigated and reported
upon by M. Aymard, and afterwards by Mr. Poulett
Scrope, upon whose mind no possible doubt of the
[Pg 105]fact remained. From what we now know of the
occurrence of human remains and works of art in
other parts of France and Europe, no surprise need
be felt at the occurrence of human remains in company
with some extinct mammalia in these volcanic
tuffs, which belong to the Post-Pliocene or superficial
alluvia antecedent to the historic period.[10]

(h.) Mont Dôme Chain.       We now come to the
consideration of the most recent of all the volcanic
mountain groups of the region of Central France, that
of the Puy de Dôme, lying to the north of Mont Dore
and Cantal. We have seen that there is almost conclusive
evidence that man was a witness to the later
volcanic outbursts of the Vivarais, and as these craters
seem to be of somewhat earlier date than those of the
Puy de Dôme group, we cannot doubt that they were
in active eruption when human beings inhabited the
country, and not improbably within what is known
as the Historic Period. No mention, however, is made
either by Cæsar, Pliny, or other Roman writers of the
existence of active volcanoes in this region. Cæsar,
who was a close observer, and who carried the Roman
arms into Auvergne, makes no mention of such; nor
yet does the elder Pliny, who enumerated the known
burning mountains of his day all over the Roman
[Pg 106]Empire. It is not till we come down to the fifth
century of our era that we find any notices which
might lead us to infer the existence of volcanic action
in Central France. This is the well-known letter
written by Sidonius Apollonarius, bishop of Auvergne,
to Alcinus Avitus, bishop of Vienne, in which the
former refers to certain terrific terrestrial manifestations
which had occurred in the diocese of the latter.
But, as Dr. Daubeny observes, this is no evidence of
volcanic action in Auvergne, where Sidonius himself
resided; the terrestrial disturbances above referred
to may have been earthquake shocks of extreme
severity.[11]

But although we have no reliably historical record
of volcanic action amongst the mountains of the Mont
Dôme group, the fact that these are, comparatively,
extremely recent will be evident to an observer visiting
this district, and this conclusion is based on three
principal grounds: first, because of the well-preserved
forms of the original craters, though generally composed
of very loose material, such as ashes, lapilli, and
slag; secondly, because of the freshness of the lava-streams
over whose rugged surfaces even a scanty
herbage has in some places scarcely found a footing;[12]
and thirdly, because the lava from the crater-cones has
invaded channels previously occupied by the earlier
lavas, or those which had been eroded since the
overflow of the great basaltic sheets of Mont Dore.
Still, as in the case of the valleys of Lake Aidot, of
Channonat, and of Royat, these streams are sufficiently
[Pg 107]ancient to have given time for the existing rivers to
have worn out in them channels of some depth, but
bearing no comparison to the great valleys which had
been eroded out of the more ancient lavas, such as
those of the Coiron, of the Ardèche, and of the
Dordogne and Chambon in the district of Mont Dore.

(i.) Dome-shaped Volcanic Hills.       I have previously
(page 15) referred to the two classes of volcanic eminences
to be found in the chain of the Puy de Dôme;
one indicated by the name itself, formed of a variety
of trachytic lava called "domite," and of the form of a
dome; the other, composed of fragmental matter piled
up in the form of a crater or cup, often ruptured on
one side by a stream of lava which has burst through
the side, owing to its superior density. Of the former
class the Puy de Dôme and the Grand Sarcoui (see
Fig. 18) are the most striking examples out of the
five enumerated by Scrope, while there is a large
number, altogether sixty-one, belonging to the latter
class. These domes and crater-cones, as already
stated, rise from a platform of granite, either directly
or from one formed of the lava-sheets of the Mont
Dore region, which in turn overlies the granitic platform.
Of the nearly perfect craters there are the
Petit Puy de Dôme, lying partially against the
northern flank of the greater eminence; the Puy de
Cone, remarkable for the symmetry of its conical
form, rising to a height of 900 feet from the plain;
and the Puys de Chaumont and Thiolet lying to the
north of the Puy de Dôme. Of those to the south of
this mount, two out of the three craters of the Puy de
Barme and the Puy de Vichatel are perfect; but most
of the crater-cones south of the Puy de Dôme are
breached. Some of the lava streams by which these
[Pg 108]craters were broken down flowed for long distances.
That the lava followed the showers of ashes and lapilli
forming the walls of the craters is rendered very evident
in the case of the Puy de la Vache, whose lava-stream
coalescing with those from the Puy de la Solas and
Puy Noir, deluged the surrounding tracts and flowed
down the Channonat Valley as far as La Roche
Blanc in the Vale of Clermont. In the interior of
the upper part of the crater still remaining may be
seen the level (so to speak) to which the molten lava
rose before it burst its barrier. This level is marked
by a projecting platform of reddish or yellow material,
rich in specular iron, apparently part of the frothy
scum which formed on the surface of the lava and
adhered to the side of the basin at the moment of its
being emptied.

Space does not permit a fuller description of this
remarkable assemblage of extinct volcanoes, and the
reader must be referred for further details to the work
of Mr. Scrope. I shall content myself with some
further reference to the central figure in this grand
chain, the Puy de Dôme itself.

Ascent of the Puy de Dôme.       On ascending by the
winding path up the steep side of the mount, and on
reaching the somewhat flattened summit, the first
objects which strike the eye are the massive foundations
of the Roman temple of Mercury; they are hewn
out of solid grey lava, altogether different from the
rock of the Puy de Dôme itself, which must have been
obtained from one of the lava-sheets of the Mont
Dore group. To have carried these large blocks to
their present resting-place must have cost no little
labour and effort. The temple is supposed to have
been surmounted by a colossal statue of the winged
[Pg 109]deity, visible from all parts of the surrounding
country which was dedicated to his honour, and the
foundations were only discovered a few years ago
when excavating for the foundation of the observatory,
which stands a little further on under the charge
of Professor Janssen. On proceeding to the northern
crest of the platform a wonderful view of the extinct
craters and domes       about forty in number, and terminating
in the Puy de Beauny, the most northerly
member of the chain       is presented to the spectator.
To the right is the Vale of Clermont and the rich valley
of the Allier merging into the great plain of Central
France. On the south side of the platform a no less
remarkable spectacle meets the eye. The chain of
Puys and broken craters stretches away southwards
for a distance of nearly ten miles, while the horizon is
bounded in that direction by the lofty masses of the
Mont Dore, Cantal, and Le Puy ranges. Nor does
it require much effort of the imagination to restore
the character of the region when these now dormant
volcanoes were in full activity, projecting showers of
ashes and stones high into the air amidst flames of
fire and vast clouds of incandescent gas and steam.

The material of which the Puy de Dôme is formed
consists of a light grey, nearly white, soft felsitic
lava, containing crystals of mica, hornblende, and
specular iron-ore. It is highly vesicular, and was
probably extruded in a pasty condition from a throat
piercing the granitic plateau and the overlying sheet
of ancient lava of Mont Dore. It has been suggested
that such highly felsitic and acid lavas as that of
which the Puy de Dôme, the Grand Sarcoui, and
Cliersou are composed, may have had their origin
in the granite itself, melted and rendered viscous by
[Pg 110]intense heat. Dr. E. Gordon Hull has suggested
that the domite hills (owing to their low specific
gravity) may have filled up pre-existing craters
of ashes and scoriæ without rupturing them, as
in the case of the heavier basaltic lavas, and then
still continuing to be extruded, may have entirely
enveloped them in its mass; so that each domite
hill encloses within its interior a crater formed of
ashes, stones, and scoriæ. In the case of the Puy
de Dôme there is some evidence that the domite
matter rests on a basis of ashes and scoriæ, which
may be seen in a few places around the base of the
cone. It is difficult without some such theory as
this to explain how a viscous mass was able to
raise mountains some 2000 or 3000 feet above the
surrounding plain.[13]

(j.) Sketch of the Volcanic History of Central
France.       It now only remains to give a brief resumé
of the volcanic history of this region as it may be
gathered from the relations of the rocks and strata
to the volcanic products, and of these latter to each
other.

1st Stage.       It would appear that at the close of
the Eocene period great terrestrial changes occurred.
The bed of the sea was converted into dry land, the
strata were flexured and denuded, and a depression
was formed in the granitic floor of Central France,
which, in the succeeding Miocene period, was converted
into an extensive lake peopled by molluscs,
fishes, reptiles, and pachyderms of the period.

[Pg 111]2nd Stage.       Towards the close of the Miocene
epoch volcanic eruptions commenced on a grand
scale over the granitic platform in the districts now
called Mont Dore, Cantal, and the Vivarais. Vast
sheets of trachytic and basaltic lavas successively
invaded the tracts surrounding the central orifices of
eruption, now constituting the more ancient of the
lava-sheets of the Auvergne region, and, invading
the waters of the neighbouring lake, overspread the
lacustrine deposits which were being accumulated
therein. These volcanic eruptions probably continued
throughout the Pliocene period, interrupted
by occasional intervals of inactivity, and ultimately
altogether ceased.

3rd Stage.       Towards the close of the Pliocene
period terrestrial movements took place, owing to
which the waters of the lake began to fall away, and
the sheets of lava were subjected to great denudation.
This process, probably accelerated by excessive rainfall
during the succeeding Post-Pliocene and Pluvial
periods, was continued until plains and extensive
river-valleys were eroded out of the sheets of lava and
their supporting granitic rocks and the adjoining
lacustrine strata.

4th Stage.       A new outburst of volcanic forces
marks this stage, during which the chain of the Puy
de Dôme was thrown up on the west, and that of the
newer cones of the Vivarais on the south-east of the
lacustrine tract. The waters of the lake were now
completely drained away through the channel of the
Allier, and denudation, extending down to the
present day, began over the area now forming the
Vale of Clermont and adjoining districts. The volcanic
action ultimately spent its force; and somewhere
[Pg 112]about the time of the appearance of man, the mammoth,
rhinoceros, stag, and reindeer on the scene,
eruptions entirely ceased, and gradually the region
assumed those conditions of repose by which it is
now physically characterised.

[1] The literature referring to this region is very extensive. Guettard
in 1775, afterwards Faujas, published descriptions of the rocks of the
Vivarais and Velay; and Desmarest's geological map, published in
1779, is a work of great merit. The district was afterwards described
by Daubeny, Lyell, Von Buch, and others; but by far the most
complete work is that of Scrope, entitled Volcanoes of Central France,
containing maps and numerous illustrations, published in 1826, and
republished in a more extended form in 1858; to this I am largely
indebted.

[2] A monument to Pascal, erected by the citizens, occupies the centre
of the square in Clermont. It will be remembered that Pascal verified
the conclusions arrived at by Torricelli regarding the pressure of the
atmosphere, by carrying a Torricellian tube to the summit of the
Puy de Dôme, and recording how the mercury continually fell during
the ascent, and rose as he descended. This experiment was made in
1645.

[3] In this visit to Auvergne in the summer of 1880, the author was
accompanied by his son, Dr. E. Gordon Hull, and Sir Robert S. Ball.
On reaching the station at the summit of the ridge it seemed as if
the volcanic fires had again been lighted, for the whole sky was aglow
with the rays of the western sun.

[4] On the other hand, certain beds of ash and other volcanic ejecta
occur in the uppermost strata of lake deposits of Limagne, so that these
may indicate the commencement of the period of eruption, as suggested
further on.

[5] Only very closely; for Mr. Scrope considers that the crater-cones
of the chain of the Haute Loire give evidence of a somewhat earlier
epoch of activity than those of the Puy de Dôme, as they have undergone
a greater amount of subaerial erosion.

[6] The extent of this river erosion has been clearly brought out by
Scrope, and is admirably illustrated by several of his panoramic views,
such as that in Plate IX. of his work.

XII. of his work, from which the above account is taken. At one spot
near the village of Le Gua there is a break in the continuity of the sheet.

[10] See Scrope, loc. cit., p. 181; also Appendix, p. 228. While there
is no primâ facie reason for questioning the origin of the Demise skull,
yet from what Lyell states in his Antiquity of Man, p. 196, it will be
seen that he found it impossible to identify its position, or to determine
beyond question that its interment was due to natural causes. But
assuming this to be the case, he shows how the individual to whom it
belonged might have been enveloped in volcanic tuff or mud showered
down during the final eruption of the volcano of Demise. MM.
Hébert and Lartet, on visiting the locality, also failed to find in situ any
exact counterpart of the stone now in the museum of Le Puy.

[11] See Daubeny, Volcanoes, p. 31.

[12] That is to say, the surfaces of the lava-streams are not at all, or
only slightly, decomposed into soil suitable for the growth of plants,
except in rare instances.

the density of the domite of the Puy de Dôme to be 2.5, while
that of lava is about 3.0.

CHAPTER VII.

THE VOLCANIC DISTRICT OF THE RHINE VALLEY.


The region bordering the Rhine along both its
banks above Bonn, and extending thence along the
valley of the Moselle and into the Eifel, has been
the theatre of active volcanic phenomena down into
recent times, but at the present day the volcanoes are
dormant or extinct.

(a.) Geological Structure.       The fundamental rocks
of this region belong to the Silurian, Devonian, and
Carboniferous systems, consisting of schists, grits, and
limestones, with occasional horizontal beds of Miocene
sandstone and shale with lignite, resting on the
upturned edges of the older rocks. Scattered over
the greater part of the district here referred to are a
number of conical eminences, often with craters, the
bottoms of which are usually sunk much below the
present level of the country, and thus receiving the
surface drainage, have been converted into little
lakes called "maars," differing from ordinary lakes by
their circular form and the absence of any apparent
outlet for their waters.[1]

[Pg 114]But before entering into details, it may be desirable
to present the reader with a short outline of the
physical history of the region (which has been
ably done by Dr. Hibbert in his treatise, to which I
have already referred), so as to enable him better to
understand the succession of physical events in its
volcanic history.



  



Fig. 20.       Sketch Map to show the physical condition of the Rhenish
area in the Miocene epoch.       (After Hibbert.)




(b.) Physical History.       From the wide distribution
of stratified deposits of sand and clay at high levels
on both banks of the Rhine north of the Moselle,
it would appear that an extensive fresh-water basin,
which Dr. Hibbert calls "The Basin of Neuwied,"
occupied a considerable tract on both banks, in the
centre of which the present city of Neuwied stands.
This basin was bounded towards the south by the
slopes of the Hündsruck and Taunus, which at the
[Pg 115]time here referred to formed a continuous chain of
mountains. (Fig. 20.) To the south of this chain
lay the Tertiary basin of Mayence, which was connected
at an early period       that of the Miocene       with
the waters of the ocean, as shown by the fact that the
lower strata contain marine shells; these afterwards
gave place to fresh-water conditions. The basin of
Neuwied was bounded towards the north by a ridge of
Devonian strata which extended across the present
gorge of the Rhine between Andernach and Linz,
and to the north of this barrier lay another more
extensive fresh-water basin, that of Cologne. From
this it will be seen that the Rhine, as we now find
it, had then only an infantile existence; in fact, its
waters to the south of the Hündsruck ridge drained
away towards the south. But towards the commencement
of the Pliocene period the barriers of the
Hündsruck and Taunus, as also that of the Linz, were
broken through, and the course of the waters was
changed; and thus gradually, as the river deepened its
bed, the waters were drained off from the great lakes.[2]
This rupture of the barriers may have been due,
in the first instance, to the terrestrial disturbances
accompanying the volcanic eruptions of the Eifel and
Siebengebirge, though the erosion of the gorges at
Bingen and at Linz to their present depth and
dimensions is of course due to prolonged river action.
It was about the epoch we have now arrived at       viz.,
the close of the Miocene       that volcanic action
burst forth in the region of the Lower Rhine. It is
probable that this action commenced in the district
[Pg 116]of the Siebengebirge, and afterwards extended into
that of the Moselle and the Eifel, the volcanoes of
which bear evidence of recent date. Layers of trachytic
tuff are interstratified with the deposits of sand, clay,
and lignite of the formation known as that of the
Brown Coal       of Miocene age       which underlies nearly
the whole of the volcanic district on both sides of the
Rhine near Bonn,[3] thus showing that volcanic action
had already commenced in that part to some extent;
but it does not appear from Dr. Hibbert's statement
that any such fragments of eruptive rock are to be
found in the strata which were deposited over the
floor of the Neuwied basin.[4] It will be recollected
that the epoch assigned for the earliest volcanic eruptions
of Auvergne was that here inferred for those of the
Lower Rhine       viz., the close of the Miocene stage       and
from evidence subsequently to be adduced from
other European districts, it will be found that there
was a very widely spread outburst of volcanic action
at this epoch.

(c.) The Range of the Siebengebirge.       This range
of hills       formed of the older volcanic rocks of the
Lower Rhine       rises along the right bank of this
noble river opposite Bonn, where it leaves the narrow
gorge which it traverses all the way from Bingen, and
opens out on the broad plain of Northern Germany.
The range consists of a succession of conical hills sometimes
flat-topped       as in the case of Petersberg; and at
the Drachenfels, near the centre of the range it presents
to the river a bold front of precipitous cliffs of trachyte
[Pg 117]porphyry. The sketch (Fig. 21) here presented was
taken by the author in 1857 from the old extinct volcano
of Roderberg, and will convey, perhaps, a better
idea of the character of this picturesque range than a
description. The Siebengebirge, although appearing
as an isolated group of hills, is in reality an offshoot
from the range of the Westerwald, which is connected
with another volcanic district of Central
Germany known as the Vogelsgebirge. The highest
point in the range is attained in the Lohrberg, which
rises 1355 feet above the sea; the next, the Great
Tränkeberg, 1330 feet; and the next, Great Oelberg,
1296 feet.



  



Fig. 21.       The Volcanic Range of the Siebengebirge, seen from the left bank of the Rhine, above Bonn.       (Original.)




[Pg 118]The range consists mainly of trachytic rocks       namely,
trachyte-conglomerate, and solid trachyte,
of which H. von Dechen makes two varieties       that
of the Drachenfels, and that of the Wolkenburg. But
associated with these highly-silicated varieties of lava       and
generally, if not always, of later date       are basaltic
rocks which cap the hills of Petersberg, Nonnenstrom,
Gr. and Ll. Oelberg, Gr. Weilberg, and Ober
Dollendorfer Hardt. The question whether there is a
transition from the one variety of volcanic rock into
the other, or whether each belongs to a distinct and
separate epoch of eruption, does not seem to be very
clearly determined. Mr. Leonard Horner states that
it would be easy to form a suite of specimens showing
a gradation from a white trachyte to a black basalt;[5]
but we must recollect that when Mr. Horner wrote,
the microscopic examination of rocks by means of
thin sections was not known or practised, and an
examination by this process might have proved that
this apparent transition is unreal. According to H.
[Pg 119]von Dechen, there are sheets of basalt older than the
greater mass of the brown coal formation, and others
newer than the trachyte;[6] while dykes of basalt
traversing the trachytic lavas are not uncommon.[7]

The trachyte-conglomerate       which seems to be
associated with the upper beds of the brown coal strata       is
traversed by dykes of trachyte of later date; and
though it is difficult to trace the line between the two
varieties of this rock on the ground, Dr. von Rath
has recognised the general distinction between them,
which consists in the greater abundance of hornblende
and mica in the trachyte of the Wolkenburg than in
that of the Drachenfels.

The trachyte of the Drachenfels was probably the
neck of a volcano which burst through the fundamental
schists of the Devonian period. It is remarkable
for the large crystals of sanidine (glassy felspar)
which it contains, and has a rude columnar structure.

The absence of any clearly-defined craters of
eruption, such as are to be found in the Eifel district
and on the left bank of the Rhine       as, for example,
in the case of the Roderberg       may be regarded as
sufficient evidence that this range is of comparatively
high antiquity. It seems to bear the same relation to
the more modern craters of the Eifel and Moselle that
the Mont Dore and Cantal volcanoes do to those of
the Puy de Dôme. In both cases, denudation carried
on throughout perhaps the Pliocene and Post-Pliocene
periods down to the present day has had the effect
of demolishing the original craters; so that what we
now observe as forming these ranges are the consolidated
[Pg 120]columns of original molten matter which
filled the throats of the old volcanoes, or the sheets of
lava which were extruded from them, but are now
probably much reduced in size and extent.

Having thus given a description of the older
volcanic range on the right bank of the Rhine, we
shall cross the river in search of some details regarding
the more recent group of Rhenish volcanoes, commencing
with that of the Roderberg, a remarkable
hill a few miles south of Bonn, from which the view
of the Seven Mountains was taken.



  



Fig. 22.       Section of the extinct crater of the Roderberg on the
bank of the Rhine, above Bonn.       (Original.)




(d.) The Roderberg.       This crater, which was visited
by the author in 1857, is about one-fourth of a mile
in diameter, and is in the form of a cup with
gentle slopes on all sides. In its centre is a farmhouse
surrounded by corn-fields. The general section
through the hill is represented above (Fig. 22).

The flanks on the north side are composed of loose
quartzose gravel (gerolle), a remnant of the deposits
formed around the margin of the "Basin of Neuwied"
described above (p. 114). This gravel is found covering
the terraces of the brown coal formation several
hundred feet above the Rhine. Besides quartz-pebbles,
the deposit contains others of slate, grit, and
volcanic rock. On reaching the edge of the crater
we find the gravel covered over by black and purple
scoria or slag the superposition of the scoria on the
[Pg 121]gravel being visible in several places, showing that
the former is of more recent origin. On the opposite
side of the crater, overlooking the Rhine, we find the
cliff of Rolandsec composed of hard vesicular lava,
rudely prismatic, and extending from the summit of
the hill to its base, about 250 feet below. This is the
most northerly of the group of the Eifel volcanoes.

(e.) District of the Rivers Brühl and Nette.       The
volcanic region of the Lower Eifel, drained by these
two principal streams which flow into the Rhine, will
amply repay exploration by the student of volcanic
phenomena, owing to the variety of forms and conditions
under which these present themselves within
a small space. The fundamental rock is slate or grit
of Devonian age, furrowed by numerous valleys, often
richly wooded, and diversified by conical hills of
trachyte; or by crater-cones, formed of basalt or ashes,
sometimes ruptured on one side, and occasionally sending
forth streams of lava, as in the cases of the Perlinkopf,
the Bausenberg, and the Engelerkopf. The
district attains its greatest altitude in the High Acht
(Der Hohe Acht), an isolated cone of slate capped
by basalt with olivine, and reaching a level of 2434
Rhenish feet.[8]

(f.) The Laacher See.       It would be impossible in
a work of this kind to attempt a detailed description
of the Eifel volcanoes, often of a very complex
character and obscure physical history, as in the case
of the basin of Rieden, where tufaceous deposits,
trachytic and basaltic lavas and crater-cones, are
confusedly intermingled, so that I shall confine my
[Pg 122]remarks to the deservedly famous district of the
Laacher See, which I had an opportunity of personally
visiting some years since.[9]



  



Fig. 23.       Plan and Section of the Laacher See, a lake on the
borders of the Eifel, occupying the crater of an old volcano.       G. Gravel
and volcanic sand forming banks of the lake and rim of old crater;
L. Sheet of trachytic lava with columnar structure; B. Basaltic dyke;
S. Devonian slate, etc.




The Laacher See is a lake of an oval form, over
an English mile in the shorter diameter, and surrounded
by high banks of volcanic sand, gravel, and
scoriæ, except on the east side, where cliffs of clay-slate,
in a nearly vertical position, and striking nearly
E.W., may be observed. Its depth from the surface
of the water is 214 feet.[10] The ashes of the encircling
[Pg 123]banks contain blocks of slate and lava which have
been torn from the sides of the orifice or neck of the
volcano and blown into the air; and there can be no
doubt that the ashes and volcanic gravel is the result
of very recent eruptions.

At the east side of the lake we find a stream of
scoriaceous lava of a purple or reddish colour, highly
vesicular, and containing crystals of mica; but the
most important lava-stream is that which has taken
a southerly direction from the crater of the Laacher
See towards Nieder Mendig and Mayen, for a distance
of about six miles. This great stream is covered
throughout half its distance by beds of volcanic ash
and lapilli, but emerges into the air at a distance of
about two miles from the edge of the crater (see Fig.
23), and was formerly extensively quarried in underground
caverns for millstones. Here the rock is a
vesicular trachyte, of a greyish colour, solidified in
vertical columns of hexagonal form, about four feet in
diameter, and traversed by transverse joint planes.
These quarries have been worked from the time of the
Roman occupation of the country; and, before the
introduction of iron or steel rollers for grinding corn,
millstones were exported to all parts of Europe and
the British Isles from this quarry.[11]

The district around the Laacher See is covered by
laminated ejecta of the old volcano, probably of subaërial
origin, through which bosses of the fundamental
slate peer up at intervals, while the surface is diversified
by several truncated cones.

(g.) Trass of the Brühl Valley.       The Brühl Valley,
[Pg 124]which unites with that of the Rhine at the town of
that name, and drains the northern side of the volcanic
region, has always been regarded with much
interest by travellers for the presence of a deposit of
"trass" with which it is partially filled. The origin of
this valley was pre-volcanic, as it is hewn out of the
slaty rocks of the district. But at a later period it
became filled with volcanic mud (tuffstein), out of
which the stream has made for itself a fresh channel.
The source of this mud is considered by Hibbert[12]
to have been the old volcano of the Lummerfeld,
which, after becoming dormant, was filled with water,
and thus became a lake. At a subsequent period,
however, a fresh eruption took place near the edge of
the lake, resulting in the remarkable ruptured crater
known as the Kunksköpfe, which rises about four
miles to the north of the Laacher See. The eruptions
of this volcano appear to have displaced the mud of
the Lummerfeld, causing it to flow down into the
deep gorge of the Brühl, which it completely filled, as
stated above.

On walking down the valley one may sometimes
see the junction of the tuff with the slate-rock which
enfolds it. The tuff consists of white felspathic mud,
with fragments of slate and lava, reaching a depth in
some places of 150 feet. After it has been quarried
it is ground in mills, and used for cement stone under
the name of trass. It is said to resemble the volcanic
mud by which Herculaneum was overwhelmed during
the first eruption of Vesuvius, and which was produced
by the torrents of rain mixing with the ashes
as they were blown out of the volcano.

Sufficient has probably now been written regarding
[Pg 125]the dormant, or recently extinct, volcanic districts of
Europe to give the reader a clear idea regarding
their nature and physical structure. Other districts
might be added, such as those of Central Germany,
Hungary, Transylvania, and Styria; but to do so
would be to exceed the proposed limits of this work;
and we may therefore pass on to the consideration
of the volcanic region of Syria and Palestine,
which adjoins the Mediterranean district we have
considered in a former page.

PART III.

DORMANT OR MORIBUND VOLCANOES OF
OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD.




CHAPTER I.

DORMANT VOLCANOES OF PALESTINE AND ARABIA.


(a.) Region east of the Jordan and Dead Sea.       The
remarkable line of country lying along the valley of
the Jordan, and extending into the great Arabian
Desert, has been the seat of extensive volcanic action
in prehistoric times. The specially volcanic region
seems to be bounded by the depression of the Jordan,
the Dead Sea, and the Arabah as far south as the Gulf
of Akabah; for, although Safed, lying at the head of
the Sea of Galilee on the west of the Jordan valley, is
built on a basaltic sheet, and is in proximity to an
extinct crater, its position is exceptional to the general
arrangement of the volcanic products which may be
traced at intervals from the base of Hermon into
Central Arabia, a distance of about 1000 miles.[1]

The tract referred to has been described at intervals
[Pg 127]by several authors, of whom G. Schumacher,[2] L. Lartet,[3]
Canon Tristram,[4] M. Niebuhr,[5] and C. M. Doughty[6]
may be specially mentioned in this connection.

The most extensive manifestations of volcanic energy
throughout this long tract of country appear to be
concentrated at its extreme limits. At the northern
extremity the generally wild and rugged tract of the
Jaulân and Haurân, called in the Bible Trachonitis,
and still farther to the eastward the plateau of the
Lejah, with its row of volcanic peaks sloping down to
the vast level of Bashan, is covered throughout nearly
its whole extent by great sheets of basaltic lava,
above which rise at intervals, and in very perfect form,
the old crater-cones of eruption. A similar group of
extinct craters with lava-flows has been described and
figured by a recent traveller, Mr. C. M. Doughty, in
parts of Central Arabia. The general resemblance of
these Arabian volcanoes to those of the Jaulân is
unquestionable; and as they are connected with each
other by sheets of basaltic lava at intervals throughout
the land of Moab, it is tolerably certain that the
volcanoes lying at either end of the chain belong to
one system, and were contemporaneously in a state of
activity.

(b.) Geological Conditions.       Before entering any
[Pg 128]further into particulars regarding the volcanic phenomena
of this region, it may be desirable to give a
short account of its geological structure, and the
physical conditions amongst which the igneous eruptions
were developed.

Down to the close of the Eocene period the whole
region now under consideration was occupied by the
waters of the ocean. The mountains of Sinai were
islands in this ocean, which had a very wide range
over parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe. But at the
commencement of the succeeding Miocene stage the
crust was subjected to lateral contraction, owing to
which the ocean bed was upraised. The strata were
flexured, folded, and often faulted and fissured along
lines ranging north and south, the great fault of the
Jordan-Arabah valley being the most important. At
this period the mountains of the Lebanon, the table-lands
of Judæa and of Arabia, formed of limestone,
previously constituting the bed of the ocean during the
Eocene and Cretaceous periods, were converted into
land surfaces. Along with this upheaval of the sea-bed
there was extensive denudation and erosion of the
strata, so that valleys were eroded over the subaërial
tracts, and the Jordan-Arabah valley received its
primary form and outline.

Up to this time there does not appear to have been
any outbreak of volcanic forces; but with the succeeding
Pliocene period these came into play, and eruptions
of basaltic lava took place along rents and
fissures in the strata, while craters and cones of slag,
scoriæ, and ashes were thrown up over the region
lying to the east of the Sea of Galilee and the sources
of the Jordan on the one hand, and the central parts
of the great Arabian Desert on the other. These
[Pg 129]eruptions, probably intermittent, continued into the
succeeding Glacial or Pluvial period, and only died
out about the time that the earliest inhabitants
appeared on the scene.

(c.) The Jaulân and Haurân.       This tract is bounded
by the valley of the Jordan and the Sea of Galilee on
the west, from which it rises by steep and rocky
declivities into an elevated table-land, drained by the
Yarmûk (Hieromax), the Nahr er Rukkâd, and other
streams, which flow westwards into the Jordan along
deep channels in which the basaltic sheets and underlying
limestone strata are well laid open to view.

On consideration it seems improbable that the great
sheets of augitic lava, such as cover the surface of
the land of Bashan, are altogether the product of the
volcanic mountains which appear to be confined to
special districts in this wide area. Some of the craters
do indeed send forth visible lava-streams, but they are
insignificant as compared with the general mass of
the plateau-basalts; and the crater-cones themselves
appear in some cases to be posterior to the platforms
of basalt from which they rise. It is very probable,
therefore, that the lavas of this region have, in the
main, been extruded from fissures of eruption at an
early period, and spread over the surface of the
country in the same manner as those of the Snake
River region, and the borders of the Pacific Ocean of
North America, and possibly of the Antrim Plateau
in Ireland, afterwards to be described.

The volcanic hills which rise above the plateau are
described in detail by Schumacher. Of these, Tell
Abû Nedîr is the largest in the Jaulân. It reaches an
elevation of 4132 feet above the Mediterranean Sea,
and 1710 feet above the plain from which it rises;
[Pg 130]the circumference of its base is three miles, and the
rim of the crater itself, which is oval in form, is
1331 yards in its larger diameter. The interior is
cultivated by Circassians, and is very fruitful; the
walls descend at an angle of about 30° on the inside,
the exterior slope of the mountain being about 22°.
The cone seems to be formed chiefly of scoriæ, and
the lava-stream, which issues forth from the interior,
forms a frightfully stony and lacerated district.[7]



  



Fig. 24.       Extinct Craters in the Jaulân, north-east from the Sea of
Galilee, called Tell Abû en Nedâ and Tell el Urâm, with a central
cone.       (After Schumacher.)




Another remarkable volcano is the Tell Abû en
Nedâ (Fig. 24). This is a double crater, with a
cone (probably of cinders) rising from the interior
of one of them. The highest point of the rim of
one of the craters reaches a level of 4042 feet above
the sea. A lava-stream issues forth from Abû en
Nedâ, and unites with another from a neighbouring
volcano.

[Pg 131]Tell el Ahmâr is a ruptured crater of imposing
aspect, reaching an elevation of 4060 feet, and sending
forth a lava-current, which falls in regular terraces
from the outlet towards the west and north.

The ruptured crater of Tell el Akkasheh, which
reaches a height of 3400 feet, has a less forbidding
aspect than the greater number of the extinct
volcanoes of this region, owing to the fact that its
sides are covered by oaks, which attain to magnificent
proportions along the summit. Numerous other
volcanic hills occur in this district, but the most
remarkable is that called Tell el Farras (the Hill of
the Horse). It is an isolated mountain, visible from
afar, and reaches an elevation of 3110 feet, or nearly
800 feet above the surrounding plain. The oval
crater of this volcano opens towards the north, and
has a depth of 108 feet below the edge, with moderately
steep sloping sides (17°-32°), while the slope
of the exterior, at first steep, gradually lessens to
20°-21°. These slopes are covered with reddish or
yellowish slag. The above examples will probably
suffice to afford the reader a general idea of the size
and form of the volcanoes in this little known
region.

It has been stated above that the great lava-floods
have probably been poured forth intermittently.
The statement receives confirmation from the observations
of Canon Tristram, made in the valley of the
Yarmûk.[8] This impetuous torrent rushes down a
gorge, sometimes having limestone on one side and a
wall of basalt on the other. This is due to the fact
that the river channel had been eroded before the
volcanic eruptions had commenced; but on the lava-stream
[Pg 132]reaching the channel, it naturally descended
towards the valley of the Jordan along its bed, displacing
the river, or converting it into clouds of
steam. Subsequently the river again hewed out its
channel, sometimes in the lava, sometimes between
this rock and the chalky limestone. But, in addition
to this, it has been observed that there is a bed of
river gravel interposed between two sheets of basalt
in the Yarmûk ravine; showing that after the first
flow of that molten rock the river reoccupied its
channel, which was afterwards invaded by another
molten lava-stream, into which the waters have again
furrowed the channel which they now occupy. The
basaltic sheets descend under the waters of the Sea of
Galilee on the east side, and were probably connected
with those of Safed, crossing the Jordan valley north
of that lake; owing to this the waters of the Lake of
Merom (Huleh) were pent up, and formerly covered
an extensive tract, now formed of alluvial deposits.

(d.) Land of Moab.       Proceeding southwards into
the Land of Moab, the volcanic phenomena are here
of great interest. Extensive sheets of basaltic lava,
described as far back as 1807 by Seetzen, and more
recently by Lartet and Tristram, are found at intervals
between the Wâdies Mojib (Arnon) and Haidan. On
either side of the Mojib, cliffs of columnar basalt are
seen capping the beds of white Cretaceous limestone,
while a large mass has descended into the W.
Haidan between cliffs of limestone and marl on either
hand.

Around Jebel Attarus       a dome-shaped hill of limestone       a
sheet of basaltic lava has been poured, and
has descended the deep gorge of the Zerka Maïn,
which enters the Dead Sea some 2000 feet below.
[Pg 133]This gorge had been eroded before the basaltic
eruption, so that the stream of molten lava took its
course down the bed of this stream to the water's
edge, and grand sections have been laid bare by
subsequent erosion along the banks. Pentagonal
columns of black basalt form perpendicular walls,
first on one side, then on the other; while considerable
masses of scoriæ, peperino, and breccia appear at the
head of the glen, probably marking the orifice of
eruption. Other eruptions of basalt occur, one at
Mountar ez Zara, to the south of Zerka Maïn, and
another at Wady Ghuweir, near the north-eastern
end of the Dead Sea. There are no lava-streams on
the western side of the Ghor, or of the Dead Sea.[9]

The outburst of the celebrated thermal springs of
Callirrhoë, together with nine or ten others, along the
channel of the Zerka Maïn, is a circumstance which
cannot be dissociated from the occurrence of basaltic
lava at this spot. In a reach of three miles, according
to Tristram, there are ten principal springs, of which
the fifth in descent is the largest; but the seventh
and eighth, about half a mile lower down, are the
most remarkable, giving forth large supplies of sulphurous
water. The tenth and last is the hottest of
all, indicating a temperature of 143° Fahr. Thus it
would appear that the heat increases with the depth
from the upper surface of the table-land; a result
which might be expected, supposing the heated
volcanic rocks to be themselves the source of the high
temperature. To a similar cause may be attributed
the hot-springs of Hammath, near Tiberias, and those
of the Yarmûk near its confluence with the Jordan.
[Pg 134]Some of these and other springs break out along, or
near, the line of the great Jordan-Arabah fault which
ranges throughout the whole extent of this depression,
from the base of Hermon to the Gulf of Akabah,
generally keeping close to the eastern margin of the
valley.

(e.) The Arabian Desert.       The basaltic lava-floods
occupy a very large extent of the Arabian Desert,
from El Hisma (lat. 27° 35' N.) to the neighbourhood
of Mecca on the south, a distance of about 440 miles,
with occasional intervals. The lava-sheets are called
"Harras" (or "Harrat"), one of which, Harrat Sfeina,
terminates about ten miles north of Mecca. The
lava-sheets rest sometimes on the red sandstone, at
other times, on the granite and other crystalline rocks
of great geological antiquity. In addition to the
sheets of basalt, numerous crater-cones rise from the
basaltic platform at a level of 5000 feet above the sea,
and two volcanic mountains, rising far to the west
of the principal range, called respectively Harrât
Jeheyma and H. Rodwa, almost overlook the coast
of the Red Sea.[10]

(f.) Age of the Volcanic Eruptions.       It is very clear
that the first eruptions, producing the great basaltic
sheets of Moab and Arabia, occurred after the principal
features of the country had been developed. The
depression of the Jordan-Arabah valley, the elevation
of the eastern side of this valley along the great
fault line, and the channels of the principal tributary
streams, such as those of the Yarmûk and Zerka
Maïn, all these had been eroded out before they were
invaded by the molten streams of lava. Now, as these
[Pg 135]physical features were developed and sculptured out
during the Miocene period, as I have elsewhere shown
to be the case,[11] we may with great probability refer the
volcanic eruptions to the geological epoch following       namely,
the Pliocene. How far downwards towards
the historic period the eruptions continued is not so
certain. Dr. Daubeny, quoting several passages from
the Old Testament prophets,[12] says it might be inferred
that volcanoes were in activity even so late as to
admit of their being included within the limits of
authentic history. The poetic language and imagery
used in these passages by the prophets certainly lends
a probability to this view, but nothing more. On the
other hand, these regions have suffered through many
centuries from the secondary effects of seismic action
and subterranean forces, and earthquake shocks have
laid in ruins the great temples and palaces of Palmyra,
Baalbec, and other cities of antiquity. The
same uncertainty regarding the time at which volcanic
action died out, with reference to the appearance of
man on the scene, hangs over the region of Arabia
and Syria, as we have seen to be the case in reference
to the extinct volcanoes of Auvergne, the Eifel, and
the Lower Rhine. In all these cases the commencement
and close of eruptive action appear to have
been very much about the same period       namely, the
Miocene period on the one hand, and that at which
man entered upon the scene on the other; but in the
case of Syria and Western Palestine, the close of the
volcanic period may have been somewhat more than
2000 B.C.

[1] Lake Phiala, near the Lake of Huleh, is also situated to the west
of the Jordan valley. Its origin, according to Tristram, is volcanic.

CHAPTER II.

THE VOLCANIC REGIONS OF NORTH AMERICA.


(a.) Contrast between the Eastern and Western
Regions.       In no point is there a more remarkable
contrast between the physical structure of Eastern
and Western America than in the absence of volcanic
phenomena in the former and their prodigious development
in the latter. The great valley of the Mississippi
and its tributaries forms the dividing territory
between the volcanic and non-volcanic areas; so that
on crossing the high ridges in which the western
tributaries of America's greatest river have their
sources, and to which the name of the "Rocky Mountains"
more properly belongs, we find ourselves in a
region which, throughout the later Tertiary times down
almost to the present day, has been the scene of
volcanic operations on the grandest scale; where
lava-floods have been poured over the country through
thousands of square miles, and where volcanic cones,
vying in magnitude with those of Etna, Vesuvius, or
Hecla, have established themselves. This region,
generally known as "The Great Basin," is bounded
on the west by the "Pacific Range" of mountains,
and includes portions of New Mexico, Arizona,
California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Idaho, Oregon,
Wyoming, Montana, and Washington. To the south
[Pg 137]it passes into the mountainous region of Mexico, also
highly volcanic; and thence into the ridge of Panama
and the Andes. It cannot be questioned but that
the volcanic nature of the Great Basin is due to the
same causes which have originated the volcanic outbursts
of the Andes; but, from whatever cause, the
volcanic forces have here entered upon their secondary
or moribund stage. In the Yellowstone Valley,
geysers, hot springs, and fumaroles give evidence of
this condition. In other districts the lava-streams
are so fresh and unweathered as to suggest that they
had been erupted only a few hundred years ago; but
no active vent or crater is to be found over the whole
of this wide region. A few special districts only can
here be selected by way of illustration of its special
features in connection with its volcanic history.

(b.) The Plateau Country of Utah and Arizona.       This
tract, which is drained by the Colorado River
and its tributaries, is bounded on the north by the
Wahsatch range, and extends eastwards to the base
of the Sierra Nevada. Round its margin extensive
volcanic tracts are to be found, with numerous peaks
and truncated cones       the ancient craters of eruption       of
which Mount San Francisco is the culminating
eminence. South of the Wahsatch, and occupying the
high plateaux of Utah, enormous masses of volcanic
products have been spread over an area of 9000 square
miles, attaining a thickness of between 3000 and 4000
feet. The earlier of these great lava-floods appear to
have been trachytic, but the later basaltic; and in the
opinion of Captain Dutton, who has described them,
they range in point of time from the Middle Tertiary
(Miocene) down to comparatively recent times.

(c.) The Grand Cañon.       To the south of the high
[Pg 138]plateaux of Utah are many minor volcanic mountains,
now extinct; and as we descend towards the Grand
Cañon of Colorado we find numerous cinder-cones
scattered about at intervals near the cliffs.[1] Extensive
lava-fields, surmounted by cinder-cones, occupy the
plateau on the western side of the Grand Cañon; and,
according to Dutton, the great sheets of basaltic lava,
of very recent age, which occupy many hundred square
miles of desert, have had their sources in these cones of
eruption.[2] Crossing to the east of the Grand Cañon,
we find other lava-floods poured over the country at
intervals, surmounted by San Francisco       a volcanic
mountain of the first magnitude       which reaches an
elevation, according to Wheeler, of 12,562 feet above
the ocean. It has long been extinct, and its summit
and flanks are covered with snow-fields and glaciers.
Other parts of Arizona are overspread by sheets of
basaltic lava, through which old "necks" of eruption,
formed of more solid lava than the sheets, rise occasionally
above the surface, and are prominent features in
the landscape.

Further to the eastward in New Mexico, and near
the margin of the volcanic region, is another volcanic
mountain little less lofty than San Francisco, called
Mount Taylor, which, according to Dutton, rises to
an elevation of 11,390 feet above the ocean, and 8200
feet above the general level of the surrounding plateau
of lava. This mountain forms the culminating point
of a wide volcanic tract, over which are distributed
[Pg 139]numberless vents of eruption. Scores of such vents       generally
cinder-cones       are visible in every part
of the plateau, and always in a more or less dilapidated
condition.[3] Mount Taylor is a volcano, with a
central pipe terminating in a large crater, the wall of
which was broken down on the east side in the later
stage of its history.



  



Fig. 25.       Mount Shasta (14,511 feet), a snow-clad volcanic cone in California, with Mount Shastina, a secondary crater,
on the right; the valley between is filled with glacier-ice.       (After Dutton).




[Pg 140](d.) California.       Proceeding westwards into California,
we are again confronted with volcanic phenomena
on a stupendous scale. The coast range of
mountains, which branches off from the Sierra
Nevada at Mount Pinos, on the south, is terminated
near the northern extremity of the State by a very
lofty mountain of volcanic origin, called Mount
Shasta, which attains an elevation of 14,511 feet
(see Fig. 25). This mountain was first ascended by
Clarence King in 1870,[4] and although forming, as
it were, a portion of the Pacific Coast Range, it
really rises from the plain in solitary grandeur, its
summit covered by snow, and originating several
fine glaciers.

The summit of Mount Shasta is a nearly perfect
cone, but from its north-west side there juts out a
large crater-cone just below the snow-line, between
which and the main mass of the mountain there
exists a deep depression filled with glacier ice. This
secondary crater-cone has been named Mount
Shastina, and round its inner side the stream of
glacier ice winds itself, sometimes surmounting the
rim of the crater, and shooting down masses of ice
[Pg 141]into the great caldron. The length of this glacier is
about three miles, and its breadth about 4000 feet.
Another very lofty volcanic mountain is Mount
Rainier, in the Washington territory, consisting of
three peaks of which the eastern possesses a crater
very perfect throughout its entire circumference.
This mountain appears to be formed mainly of
trachytic matter. Proceeding further north into
British territory, several volcanic mountains near
the Pacific Coast are said to exhibit evidence of
activity. Of these may be mentioned Mount Edgecombe,
in lat. 57°.3; Mount Fairweather, lat. 57°.20
which rises to a height of 14,932 feet; and Mount
St. Elias, lat. 60°.5, just within the divisional line
between British and Russian territory, and reaching
an altitude of 16,860 feet. This, the loftiest of all the
volcanoes of the North American continent, except
those of Mexico, may be considered as the connecting
link in the volcanic chain between the continent
and the Aleutian Islands.[5]

(e.) Lake Bonneville.       Returning to Utah we are
brought into contact with phenomena of special
interest, owing to the inter-relations of volcanic and
lacustrine conditions which once prevailed over large
tracts of that territory. The present Great Salt
Lake, and the smaller neighbouring lakes, those called
Utah and Sevier, are but remnants of an originally
far greater expanse of inland water, the boundaries
of which have been traced out by Mr. C. K. Gilbert,
and described under the name of Lake Bonneville.[6]
The waters of this lake appear to have reached their
highest level at the period of maximum cold of the
[Pg 142]Post-Pliocene period, when the glaciers descended
to its margin, and large streams of glacier water
were poured into it. Eruptions of basaltic lava from
successive craters appear to have gone on before,
during, and after the lacustrine epochs; and the drying
up of the waters over the greater extent of their
original area, now converted into the Sevier Desert,
and their concentration into their present comparatively
narrow basins, appears to have proceeded pari
passu with the gradual extinction of the volcanic outbursts.
Two successive epochs of eruption of basalt
appear to have been clearly established       an earlier
one of the "Provo Age," when the lava was extruded
from the Tabernacle craters, and a later epoch, when
the eruptions took place from the Ice Spring craters.
The oldest volcanic rock appears to be rhyolite,
which peers up in two small hills almost smothered
beneath the lake deposits. Its eruption was long
anterior to the lake period. On the other hand, the
cessation of the eruptions of the later basaltic sheets
is evidently an event of such recent date that Mr.
Gilbert is led to look forward to their resumption at
some future, but not distant, epoch. As he truly
observes, we are not to infer that, because the outward
manifestations of volcanic action have ceased,
the internal causes of those manifestations have
passed away. These are still in operation, and must
make themselves felt when the internal forces have
recovered their exhausted energies; but perhaps not
to the same extent as before.

(f.) Region of the Snake River.       The tract of
country bordering the Snake River in Idaho and
Washington is remarkable for the vast sheets of
plateau-basalt with which it is overspread, extending
[Pg 143]sometimes in one great flood farther than the eye can
reach, and what is still more remarkable, they are
often unaccompanied by any visible craters or vents
of eruption. In Oregon the plateau-basalt is at least
2,000 feet in thickness, and where traversed by the
Columbia River it reaches a thickness of about 3,000
feet. The Snake and Columbia rivers are lined by
walls of volcanic rock, basaltic above, trachytic below,
for a distance of, in the former, one hundred, in the
latter, two hundred, miles. Captain Dutton, in describing
the High Plateau of Utah, observes that the
lavas appear to have welled up in mighty floods
without any of that explosive violence generally
characteristic of volcanic action. This extravasated
matter has spread over wide fields, deluging the
surrounding country like a tide in a bay, and overflowing
all inequalities. Here also we have evidence
of older volcanic cones buried beneath seas of lava
subsequently extruded.

(g.) Fissures of Eruption.       The absence, or rarity, of
volcanic craters or cones of eruption in the neighbourhood
of these great sheets has led American geologists
to the conclusion that the lavas were in many cases
extruded from fissures in the earth's crust rather than
from ordinary craters.[7] This view is also urged by
Sir A. Geikie, who visited the Utah region of the
Snake River in 1880, and has vividly described the
impression produced by the sight of these vast fields
of basaltic lava. He says, "We found that the older
trachytic lavas of the hills had been deeply trenched
by the lateral valleys, and that all these valleys had a
floor of black basalt that had been poured out as the last
[Pg 144]of the molten materials from the now extinct volcanoes.
There were no visible cones or vents from which these
floods of basalt could have proceeded. We rode for
hours by the margin of a vast plain of basalt stretching
southward and westward as far as the eye could
reach.... I realised the truth of an assertion made
first by Richthofen,[8] that our modern volcanoes, such
as Vesuvius and Etna, present us with by no means
the grandest type of volcanic action, but rather belong
to a time of failing activity. There have been periods
of tremendous volcanic energy, when instead of
escaping from a local vent, like a Vesuvian cone, the
lava has found its way to the surface by innumerable
fissures opened for it in the solid crust of the globe
over thousands of square miles."[9]

(h.) Volcanic History of Western America.       The
general succession of volcanic events throughout the
region of Western America appears to have been
somewhat as follows:       [10]

The earliest volcanic eruptions occurred in the later
Eocene epoch and were continued into the succeeding
Miocene stage. These consisted of rocks moderately
rich in silica, and are grouped under the heads of
propylite and andesite. To these succeeded during
the Pliocene epoch still more highly silicated rocks of
trachytic type, consisting of sanidine and oligoclase
trachytes. Then came eruptions of rhyolite during
the later Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs; and lastly,
after a period of cessation, during which the rocks
just described were greatly eroded, came the great
[Pg 145]eruptions of basaltic lava, deluging the plains, winding
round the cones or plateaux of the older lavas,
descending into the river valleys and flooding the lake
beds, issuing forth from both vents and fissures, and
continuing intermittently down almost into the present
day       certainly into the period of man's appearance
on the scene. Thus the volcanic history of Western
America corresponds remarkably to that of the European
regions with which we have previously dealt,
both as regards the succession of the various lavas
and the epochs of their eruption.

(i.) The Yellowstone Park.       The geysers and hot
springs of the Yellowstone Park, like those in Iceland
and New Zealand, are special manifestations of volcanic
action, generally in its secondary or moribund stage.
The geysers of the Yellowstone occur on a grand
scale; the eruptions are frequent, and the water is
projected into the air to a height of over 200 feet.
Most of these are intermittent, like the remarkable
one known as Old Faithful, the Castle Geyser, and
the Giantess Geyser described by Dr. Hayden, which
ejects the water to a height of 250 feet. The
geyser-waters hold large quantities of silica and
sulphur in solution, owing to their high temperature
under great pressure, and these minerals are precipitated
upon the cooling of the waters in the air, and
form circular basins, often gorgeously tinted with red
and yellow colours.[11]

lava have been forced up from beneath and have been poured over the
surface. Many cinder-cones are planted along the line of this fissure.

into steam by contact with rock at a high temperature.
[Pg 146]



CHAPTER III.

VOLCANOES OF NEW ZEALAND.


One other region of volcanic action remains to be
noticed before passing on to the consideration of
those of less recent age. New Zealand is an island
wherein seem to be concentrated all the phenomena
of volcanic action of past and present time. Though
it is doubtful if the term "active," in its full sense,
can be applied to any of the existing craters (with two
or three exceptions, such as Tongariro and Whakari
Island), we find craters and cones in great numbers
in perfectly fresh condition, extensive sheets of
trachytic and basaltic lavas, ashes, and agglomerates;
lava-floods descending from the ruptured
craters of ashes and scoriæ; old crater-basins converted
into lakes; geysers, hot springs and fumaroles
which may be counted by hundreds, and cataracts
breaking over barriers of siliceous sinter; and, lastly,
lofty volcanic mountains vying in magnitude with
Vesuvius and Etna. All these wonderful exhibitions
of moribund volcanic action seem to be concentrated
in the northern island of Auckland. The
southern island, which is the larger, also has its
natural attractions, but they are of a different kind;
chief of all is the grand range of mountains called, not
inappropriately, the "Southern Alps," vying with its
European representative in the loftiness of its peaks
[Pg 147]and the splendour of its snowfields and glaciers, but
formed of more ancient and solid rocks than those
of the northern island.

(a.) Auckland District.       We are indebted to several
naturalists for our knowledge of the volcanic regions
of New Zealand, but chiefly to Ferdinand von Hochstetter,
whose beautiful maps and graphic descriptions
leave nothing to be desired.[1] In this work Hochstetter
was assisted by Julius Haast and Sir J. Hector.
From their account we learn that the Isthmus of
Auckland is one of the most remarkable volcanic
districts in the world. It is characterised by a large
number of extinct cinder-cones, in a greater or less
perfect state of preservation, and giving origin to
lava-streams which have poured down the sides of
the hills on to the plains. Besides these are others
formed of stratified tuff, with interior craters, surrounding
in mural cliffs eruptive cones of scoriæ,
ashes, and lapilli; these cones are scattered over the
isthmus and shores of Waitemata and Manukau.
The tuff cones and craters rise from a floor of Tertiary
sandstone and shale, the horizontal strata of which
are laid open in the precipitous bluffs of Waitemata
and Manukau harbours; they sometimes contain
fossil shells of the genera Pecten, Nucula, Cardium,
Turbo, and Neritæ. As the volcanic tuff-beds are
intermingled with the Upper Tertiary strata, it is
inferred that the first outbursts of volcanic forces
occurred when the region was still beneath the waters
of the ocean. Cross-sections show that the different
layers slope both outwards (parallel to the sides) and
[Pg 148]inwards towards the bottom of the craters. Sometimes
these craters have been converted into lakes, as
in the case of those of the Eifel; but generally they are
dry or have a floor of morass. Of the crater-lakes,
those of Kohuora, five in number, are perhaps the
most remarkable; and in the case of two of these
the central cones of slag appear as islets rising from
the surface of the waters. The fresh-water lake
Pupuka has a depth of twenty-eight fathoms. To
the north of Auckland Harbour rises out of the waters
of the Hauraki Gulf the cone of Rangitoto, 920 feet
high, the flanks formed of rugged streams of basalt,
and the summit crowned by a circular crater of slag
and ash, out of the centre of which rises a second
cone with the vent of eruption. This is the largest
and newest of the Auckland volcanoes, and appears
to have been built up by successive outpourings of
basaltic lava from the central orifice, after the general
elevation of the island.



  



Fig. 26.       Forms of volcanic tuff cones, with their cross-sections, in
the Province of Auckland.       No. 1. Simple tuff cone with central crater;
No. 2. Outer tuff cone with interior cinder cone and crater; No. 3.
The same with lava-stream issuing from the interior cone.       (After Hochstetter.)




[Pg 149]Before leaving the description of the tuff-cones,
which are a peculiar feature in the volcanic phenomena
of New Zealand, and are of many forms
and varieties, we must refer to that of Mount
Wellington (Maunga Rei). This is a compound
volcano, in which the oldest and smallest of the
group is a tuff-crater-cone, exhibiting very beautifully
the outward slope of its beds. Within this
crater arise two cones of cinders, each with small
craters. It would appear that after a long interval
the larger of the two principal cones, formed of
cinders and known as Mount Wellington, burst
forth from the southern margin of the older tuff-cone,
and, being built up to a height of 850 feet,
gradually overspread the sides of its older neighbour.
Mount Wellington itself has three craters, and from
these large streams of basaltic lava have issued forth
in a westerly direction, while a branch entered and
partially filled the old tuff-crater to the northwards.

[Pg 150]Southwards from Manukau Harbour, and extending
a short distance from the coast-line to
Taranaki Point, there occurs a plateau of basalt-conglomerate
(Basaltkonglomerat), with sheets of
basaltic lava overspreading the Tertiary strata.
These plateau-basalts are intersected by eruptive
masses in the form of dykes, but still there are no
craters or cones of eruption to be seen; so that we
may infer that the sheets, at least, were extruded
from fissures in the manner of those of the Colorado
or Idaho regions of America. Proceeding still
further south into the interior of the island, we
here find a lofty plateau of an average elevation
of 2,000 feet, interposed between the Tertiary beds
of the Upper and Middle Waikato, and formed of
trachytic and pitch-stone tuff, amongst which arise
old extinct volcanic cones, such as those of Karioi,
Pirongia, Kakepuku, Maunga Tautari, Aroha, and
many others. These trachytic lavas would seem
to be more ancient than the basaltic, previously
described.

(b.) Taupo Lake, and surrounding district.       But of
all these volcanic districts, none is more remarkable
than that surrounding the Taupo Lake, which lies
amidst the Tertiary strata of the Upper Waikato
Basin. The surface of this lake is 1,250 feet above
that of the ocean, and its margin is enclosed within
a border of rhyolite and pitchstone       rising into
a mass of the same material 1,800 feet high on the
eastern side. The form of the lake does not suggest
that it is itself the crater of a volcano, but rather that
it was originated by subsidence. On all sides, however,
trachytic cones arise, of which the most remarkable
group lies to the south of the lake, just
[Pg 151]in front of the two giant trachytic cones, the loftiest
in New Zealand, one called Tongariro, rising about
6,500 feet, and the other Ruapahu, which attains an
elevation of over 9,000 feet, with the summit capped
by snow. These two lofty cones, standing side by
side, are supposed by the Maoris to be the husband
and wife to whom were born the group of smaller
cones above referred to as occupying the southern
shore of Taupo Lake. The volcano of Tongariro
may still be considered as in a state of activity, as
its two craters (Ngauruhoe and Ketetahi) constantly
emit steam, and several solfataras break out on its
flanks.[2]

(c.) Roto Mahana.       In a northerly direction from
Tongariro, and distant from the coast by a few
miles, lies in the Bay of Plenty the second of the
active volcanoes of New Zealand, the volcanic island
of Whakari (White Island), from the crater of which
are constantly erupted vast masses of steam clouds.
The distance between these two active craters
is 120 nautical miles; and along the tract joining
them steam-jets and geysers issue forth from the
deep fissures through which the lava sheets have
formerly been extruded. Numerous lakes also
occupy the larger cavities in the ground; and hot-springs,
steam-fumaroles and solfataras burst out
in great numbers along the banks of the Roto
Mahana Lake and the Kaiwaka River by which
it is drained. Amongst such eruptions of hot-water
and steam we might expect the formation of siliceous
sinter, and the deposition of sulphur and other
minerals; nor will our expectations be disappointed.
[Pg 152]For here we have the wonderful terraces of siliceous
sinter deposited by the waters entering Roto Mahana
as they descend from the numerous hot-springs or
pools near its margin. All travellers concur in
describing these terraces as the most wonderful
of all the wonders of the Lake district of New
Zealand       so great is their extent, and so rich and
varied is their colouring.

The beautiful map of Roto Mahana on an enlarged
scale by Hochstetter shows no fewer than ten large
sinter terraces descending towards the margin of this
lake, besides several mud-springs, fumaroles, and
solfataras. But the largest and most celebrated of
all the sinter terraces has within the last few years
been buried from view beneath a flood of volcanic
trass, or mud, an event which was as unexpected
as it was unwelcome. In May, 1887, the mountain
of Tarawera, which rises to the north-east of Roto
Mahana, and on the line of eruption above described,
suddenly burst forth into violent activity, covering
the country for miles around with clouds of ashes,
and, pouring down torrents of mud, completely
enveloped the beautiful terrace of sinter which had
previously been one of the wonders of New Zealand.
By the same eruption several human beings were
entombed, and their residences destroyed.

The waters of Roto Mahana, together with the
hot-springs and fountains are fed from rain, and
from the waters of Taupo Lake, which, sinking
through fissures in the ground, come in contact with
the interior heated matter, and thus steam at high
temperature and pressure is generated.[3]

[Pg 153](d.) Moribund condition of New Zealand Volcanoes.       From
what has been said, it will be inferred that in
the case of New Zealand, as in those of Auvergne,
the Eifel and Lower Rhine, Arabia, and Western
America, we have an example of a region wherein
the volcanic forces are well-nigh spent, but in which
they were in a state of extraordinary activity
throughout the later Tertiary, down to the commencement
of the present epoch. In most of these
cases the secondary phenomena of vulcanicity are
abundantly manifest; but the great exhibitions of
igneous action, when the plains were devastated by
sheets of lava, and cones and craters were piled up
through hundreds and thousands of feet, have for the
present, at least, passed away.

PART IV.

TERTIARY VOLCANIC DISTRICTS OF THE
BRITISH ISLES.




CHAPTER I.

ANTRIM.


It is an easy transition to pass from the consideration
of European and other dormant, or extinct,
volcanic regions to those of the British Isles,
though the volcanic forces may have become in
this latter instance quiescent for a somewhat longer
period. In all the cases we have been considering,
whether those of Central Italy, of the Rhine and
Moselle, of Auvergne, or of Syria and Arabia, the
cones and craters of eruption are generally present
entire, or but slightly modified in form and size by
the effects of time. But in the case of the Tertiary
volcanic districts of the British Isles this is not so.
On the contrary, these more prominent features of
vulcanicity over the surface of the ground have been
removed by the agents of denudation, and our
observations are confined to the phenomena presented
by extensive sheets of lava and beds of ash,
or the stumps and necks of former vents of eruption,
[Pg 155]together with dykes of trap by which the plateau-lavas
are everywhere traversed or intersected.

The volcanic region of the British Isles extends at
intervals from the North-east of Ireland through the
Island of Mull and adjoining districts on the mainland
of Morvern and Ardnamurchan into the Isle of Skye,
and comprises several smaller islets; the whole being
included in the general name of the Inner Hebrides.
It is doubtful if the volcanic lavas of Co. Antrim were
ever physically connected with those of the west of
Scotland, though they may be considered as contemporary
with them; and in all cases the existing
tracts of volcanic rock are mere fragments of those
originally formed by the extrusion of lavas from
vents of eruption. In addition to these, there are
large areas of volcanic rock overspread by the waters
of the ocean.

(a.) Geological Age.       The British volcanic eruptions
now under consideration are all later than the Cretaceous
period. Throughout Antrim, and in parts of
Mull, the lavas are found resting on highly eroded
faces either of the Upper Chalk (Fig. 27), or, where it
has been altogether denuded away, on still older Mesozoic
strata. From the relations of the basaltic sheets of
Antrim to the Upper Chalk, it is clear that the latter
formation, after its deposition beneath the waters of
the Cretaceous seas, was elevated into dry land and
exposed to a long period of subaërial erosion before
the first sheets of lava invaded the surface of the
ground. We are, therefore, tolerably safe in considering
the first eruptions to belong to the Tertiary
period; but the evidence, derived as it is exclusively
from plant remains, is somewhat conflicting as to the
precise epoch to which the lavas and beds of tuff
[Pg 156]containing the plant-remains are to be referred. The
probabilities appear to be that they are of Miocene
age; and if so, the trachytic lavas, which in Antrim
are older than those containing plants, may be referred
to a still earlier epoch       namely, that of the Eocene.[1]
As plant remains are not very distinctive, the question
regarding the exact time of the first volcanic eruptions
will probably remain for ever undecided; but
we are not likely to be much in error if we consider
the entire volcanic period to range from the close of
the Eocene to that of the Miocene; by far the greater
mass of the volcanic rocks being referable to the
latter epoch.

In describing the British volcanic districts it will be
most convenient to deal with them in three divisions       viz.,
those of Antrim, Mull, and Skye, commencing
with Antrim.[2]

(b.) Volcanic Area.       The great sheets of basalt and
other volcanic products of the North-east of Ireland
overspread almost the whole of the County Antrim,
and adjoining districts of Londonderry and Tyrone,
breaking off in a fine mural escarpment along the
[Pg 157]northern shore of Belfast Lough and the sea coast
throughout the whole of its range from Larne
Harbour to Lough Foyle; the only direction in which
these features subside into the general level of the
country being around the shores of Lough Neagh.
Several outliers of the volcanic sheets are to be found
at intervals around the great central plateau; such as
those of Rathlin Island, Island Magee, and Scrabo
Hill in Co. Down. The area of the basaltic plateau
may be roughly estimated at 2,000 square miles.




  



Fig. 27.       "The White Rocks," Portrush, Co. Antrim, showing the plateau-basalt resting on an eroded surface of the Upper
Chalk, with bands of flint.       (From a photograph.)




[Pg 158]The truncated edges of this marginal escarpment
rising to levels of 1,000 to 1,260 feet, as in the case of
Benevenagh in Co. Derry, and 1,825 feet at Mullaghmore,
attest an originally greatly more extended
range of the basaltic sheets; and it is not improbable
that at the close of the Miocene epoch they extended
right across the present estuary of Lough Foyle to
the flanks of the mountains of Inishowen in Donegal
in one direction, and to those of Slieve Croob in the
other. In the direction of Scotland the promontories
of Kintyre and Islay doubtless formed a part of the
original margin. Throughout this vast area the volcanic
lavas rest on an exceedingly varied rocky floor,
both as regards composition and geological age. (See
Fig. 28.) Throughout the central, southern, eastern,
and northern parts of their extent, the Chalk formation
may be considered to form this floor; but in the
direction of Armagh and Tyrone, towards the southwestern
margin, the basaltic sheets are found resting
indiscriminately on Silurian, Carboniferous, and
Triassic strata. The general relations of the plateau-basalts
to the underlying formations show, that at the
close of the Cretaceous period there had been considerable
terrestrial disturbances and great subaërial
[Pg 159]denudation, resulting in some cases in the complete
destruction of the whole of the Cretaceous strata,
before the lava floods were poured out; owing to
which, these latter are found resting on formations of
older date than the Cretaceous.[3]

[1] Mr. J. Starkie Gardner, from a recent comparison of the plant-remains
of Antrim and Mull, concludes that "that they might belong to
any age between the beginning and the end of the warmer Eocene
period; and that they cannot be of earlier, and are unlikely to be of
later, date."       Trans. Palæont. Soc., vol. xxxvii. (1883).

[2] Having dealt with this district rather fully in The Physical Geology
and Geography of Ireland (Edit. 1891, p. 81), and also in my Presidential
Address (Section C.) at the meeting of the British Association,
1874, a brief review of the subject will be sufficient here, the reader
being referred to the former treatises for fuller details. The following
should also be consulted: Gen. Portlock, Geology of Londonderry and
Tyrone (1843); Sir A. Geikie, "History of Volcanic Action during the
Tertiary Period in the British Isles," Trans. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh,
1888; and the Descriptive Memoirs of the Geological Survey relating
to this tract of country.

[3] Owing to the superposition of the basaltic masses on beds of chalk
throughout a long line of coast, we are presented with the curious
spectacle of the whitest rocks in nature overlain by the blackest, as may
be seen in the cliffs at Larne, Glenarm, Kinbane and Portrush. (See
Fig. 27.)
[Pg 160]



CHAPTER II.

SUCCESSION OF VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS.


(c.) First Stage.       The earliest eruptions of lava in
the North-east of Ireland belonged to the highly acid
varieties, consisting of quartz-trachyte with tridymite.[1]
This rock rises to the surface at Tardree and Brown
Dod hills and Templepatrick. It consists of a light-greyish
felsitic paste enclosing grains of smoke-quartz,
crystals of sanidine, plagioclase and biotite,
with a little magnetite and apatite. It is a rock
of peculiar interest from the fact that it is almost
unique in the British Islands, and has its petrological
counterpart rather amongst the volcanic hills of the
Siebengebirge than elsewhere. It is generally consolidated
with the columnar structure.

[Pg 161]



  



Fig. 29.       Part of the section shown in the quarry at Templepatrick,
showing the superposition of the basalt (d) to the trachyte (b), with the
intervening bed of flint gravel (c). All these rocks are seen to rest
upon an eroded surface of the Chalk formation (a).




The trachyte appears to have been extruded from
one or more vents in a viscous condition, the principal
vent being probably situated under Tardree mountain,
where the rock occurs in greatest mass, and it probably
arose as a dome-shaped mass, with a somewhat
extended margin, above the floor of Chalk which formed
the surface of the ground.[2] (Fig. 27.) At Templepatrick
the columnar trachyte may be observed
resting on the Chalk, or upon a layer of flint gravel
interposed between the two rocks, and which has been
thrust out of position by a later intrusion of basalt
coming in from the side.[3] It is to be observed,
however, that the trachytic lavas nowhere appear
cropping out along with the sheets of basalt around
the escarpments overlooking the sea, or inland;
showing that they did not spread very far from their
[Pg 162]vents of eruption; a fact illustrating the lower
viscosity, or fluidity, of the acid lavas as compared
with those of the basic type.

(d.) Second Stage.       After an interval, probably of
long duration, a second eruption of volcanic matter
took place over the entire area; but now the acid lavas
of the first stage are replaced by basic lavas. Now,
for the first time, vast masses of basalt and dolerite
are extruded both from vents of eruption and fissures;
and, owing to their extreme viscosity, spread themselves
far and wide until they reach the margin of
some uprising ground of old Palæozoic or Metamorphic
rocks by which the volcanic plain is almost
surrounded. The great lava sheets thus produced
are generally more or less amorphous, vesicular and
amygdaloidal, often exhibiting the globular concentric
structure, and weathering rapidly to a kind of ferruginous
sand or clay under the influence of the atmosphere.
Successive extrusions of these lavas produce
successive beds, which are piled one over the other in
some places to a depth of 600 feet; and at the close
of the stage, when the volcanic forces had for the
time exhausted themselves, the whole of the North-east
of Ireland must have presented an aspect not
unlike that of one of those great tracts of similar
lava in the region of Idaho and the Snake River in
Western America, described in a previous chapter.

(e.) Third Stage (Inter-volcanic).       The third stage
may be described as inter-volcanic. Owing to the
formation of a basin, probably not deep, and with
gently sloping sides, a large lake was formed over
the centre of the area above described. Its floor was
basalt, and the streams from the surrounding uplands
carried down leaves and stems of trees, strewing them
[Pg 163]over its bed. Occasionally eruptions of ash took place
from small vents, forming the ash-beds with plants
found at Ballypallidy, Glenarm, and along the coast
as at Carrick-a-raide. The streams also brought
down sand and gravel from the uprising domes of
trachyte, and deposited them over the lake-bed along
with the erupted ashes.[4] The epoch we are now
referring to was one of economic importance; as,
towards its close, there was an extensive deposition
of pisolitic iron-ore over the floor of the lake, sometimes
to the depth of two or three feet. This ore has
been extensively worked in recent years.




  



Fig. 30.       Cliff section above the Giant's Causeway, coast of Co. Antrim, showing successive tiers of basaltic
lava, with intervening bands of bole.




[Pg 164](f.) Fourth Stage (Volcanic).       The last stage described
was brought to a termination by a second
outburst of basic lavas on a scale probably even
grander than the preceding. These lavas consisting
of basalt and dolerite, with their varieties, and extruded
from vents and fissures, spread themselves in all
directions over the pre-existing lake deposits or the
older sheets of augitic lava, and probably entirely
buried the trachytic hills. These later sheets solidified
into more solid masses than those of the second
stage. They form successive terraces with columnar
structure, each terrace differing from that above and
below it in the size and length of the columns, and
separated by thin bands of "bole" (decomposed lava),
often reddish in colour, clearly defining the limits of
the successive lava-flows. Nowhere throughout the
entire volcanic area are these successive terraces so
finely laid open to view as along the north coast of
Antrim, where the lofty mural cliffs, worn back into
successive bays with intervening headlands by the
[Pg 165]irresistible force of the Atlantic waves, present to the
spectator a vertical section from 300 to 400 feet in
height, in which the successive tiers of columnar
basalt, separated by thin bands of bole, are seen to
rise one above the other from the water's edge to the
summit of the cliff, as shown in Fig. 30. Here, also,
at the western extremity of the line of cliffs we find
that remarkable group of vertical basaltic columns,
stretching from the base of the cliff into the Atlantic,
and known far and wide by the name of "The Giant's
Causeway," the upper ends of the columns forming a
tolerably level surface, gently sloping seawards, and
having very much the aspect of an artificial tesselated
pavement on a huge scale. A portion of the Causeway,
with the cliff in the background, is shown in the
figure (Fig. 31). The columns are remarkable for their
symmetry, being generally hexagonal, though occasionally
they are pentagons, and each column is
horizontally traversed by joints of the ball-and-socket
form, thus dividing them into distinct courses of
natural masonry. These are very well shown in the
accompanying view of the remarkable basaltic pillars
known as "The Chimneys," which stand up from
the margin of the headland adjoining the Causeway,
monuments of past denudation, as they originally
formed individuals amongst the group belonging
to one of the terraces in the adjoining coast.[5]
(Fig. 32).

[Pg 166]

the Atlantic, north coast of Co. Antrim. The horizontal segments,
or cup-and-ball joints, of the columns are well shown in this
figure. (From a photograph.)




[Pg 167](g.) Original Thickness of the Antrim Lavas.       It
is impossible to determine with certainty what may
have been the original thickness of the accumulated
sheets of basic lavas with their associated beds of ash
and bole. The greatest known thickness of the lower
zone of lavas is, as I have already stated, about 600
feet. The intermediate beds of ash and bole sometimes
attain a thickness of 40 feet, and the upper
group of basalt about 400 feet; these together would
constitute a series of over 1,000 feet in thickness. But
this amount, great as it is, is undoubtedly below the
original maximum, as the uppermost sheets have been
removed by denuding agencies, we know not to what
extent. Nor is it of any great importance. Sufficient
remains to enable us to form a just conception
of the magnitude both as regards thickness and extent
of the erupted matter of the Miocene period over the
North-east of Ireland and adjoining submerged tracts,
and of the magnitude of the volcanic operations necessary
for the production of such masses.

[Pg 168](h.) Volcanic Necks.       As already remarked, no
craters of eruption survive throughout the volcanic
region of the North-east of Ireland, owing to the
enormous extent of the denudation which this region
has undergone since the Miocene Epoch; but the old
"necks" of such craters       in other words, the pipes
filled with either solid basalt, or basalt and ashes       are
still to be found at intervals over the whole area.
Owing to the greater solidity of the lava which filled
up these "necks" over the plateau-basaltic sheets
which surround them, they appear as bosses or hills
rising above the general level of the ground. One of
these bosses of highly columnar basalt occurs between
Portrush and Bushmills, not far from Dunluce Castle,
another at Scawt Hill, near Glenarm, and a third at
Carmoney Hill above Belfast Lough. But by far
the most prominent of these old solidified vents of
eruption is that of Sleamish, a conspicuous mountain
which rises above the general level of the plateau
near Ballymena, and attains an elevation of 1,437 feet
above the sea. Seen from the west, the mountain
has the appearance of a round-topped cone; but on
examination it is found to be in reality a huge dyke,
breaking off abruptly towards the north-west, in which
direction it reaches its greatest height, then sloping
downwards towards the east. This form suggests
that Sleamish is in reality one of the fissure-vents
of eruption rather than the neck of an old volcano.
The rock of which it is formed consists of exceedingly
massive, coarsely-crystalline dolerite, rich in olivine,
and divided into large quadrangular blocks by parallel
joint planes. Its junction with the plateau-basalt
from which it rises can nowhere be seen; but at the
nearest point where the two rocks are traceable the
[Pg 169]plateau-basalt appears to be somewhat indurated;
breaking with a splintery fracture and a sharp ring
under the hammer, suggesting that the lava of
Sleamish had been extruded through the horizontal
sheets, and had considerably indurated the portions in
contact with, or in proximity to, it.[6] Amongst the
vents filled with ash and agglomerate, the most remarkable
is that of Carrick-a-raide, near Ballycastle.
It forms this rocky island and a portion of the adjoining
coast, where the beds of ash are finely displayed;
consisting of fragments and bombs of basalt, with
pieces of chalk, flint, and peperino, which is irregularly
bedded. These ash-beds attain a thickness of about
120 feet just below the road to Ballycastle, but rapidly
tail out in both directions from the locality of the
vent. Just below the ash-beds, the white chalk with
flints may be seen extending down into the sea-bed.
Nowhere in Antrim is there such a display of volcanic
ash and agglomerate as at this spot.[7]

(i.) Dykes: Conditions under which they were
Erupted.       No one can visit the geological sections
in Co. Antrim and the adjoining districts of Down,
Armagh, Derry, and Tyrone, without being struck by
the great number and variety of the igneous dykes
by which the rocks are traversed. The great majority
of these dykes are basaltic, and they are found traversing
all the formations, including the Cretaceous and
Tertiary basaltic sheets. The Carlingford and Mourne
Mountains are seamed with such dykes, and they are
[Pg 170]splendidly laid open to view along the coast south
of Newcastle in Co. Down, as also along the Antrim
coast from Belfast to Larne. The fine old castle of
Carrickfergus has its foundations on one of those dyke-like
intrusions, but one of greater size than ordinary.
All the dykes here referred to are not, however, of
the same age, as is conclusively proved by sections
amongst the Mourne Mountains where cliffs of Lower
Silurian strata, superimposed on the intrusive granite
of the district, exhibit two sets of basaltic dykes       one
(the older) abruptly terminated at the granite margin,
the other and newer penetrating the granite and Silurian
rocks alike. It is not improbable that the older
dykes belong to the Carboniferous or Permian age,
while the newer are with equal probability of Tertiary
age. Sir A. Geikie has shown that the Tertiary dykes
of the North of Ireland are representatives of others
occurring at intervals over the North of England,
and Central and Western Scotland, all pointing towards
the central region of volcanic activity; or in a parallel
direction thereto, approximating to the N.W. in
Ireland, the Island of Islay, and East Argyleshire,
but in the centre of Scotland generally ranging from
east to west.[8] The area affected by the dykes of undoubted
Tertiary age Geikie estimates at no less than
40,000 square miles       a territory greater than either
Scotland or Ireland, and equal to more than a third
of the total land-surface of the British Isles;[9] and he
regards them as posterior "to the rest of the geological
structures of the regions which they traverse."
[Pg 171]It is clear that the dykes referred to belong to one
great system of eruption or intrusion; and they may
be regarded as the manifestation of the final effort of
internal forces over this region of the British Isles.
They testify to the existence of a continuous magma
(or shell) of augitic lava beneath the crust; and as
the aggregate horizontal extent of all these dykes, or
of the fissures which they fill, must be very considerable,
it is clear that the crust through which they
have been extruded has received an accession of
horizontal space, and has been fissured by forces
acting from beneath, as the late Mr. Hopkins, of
Cambridge, had explained on mechanical grounds in
his elaborate essay many years ago.[10] This view
occurred to myself when examining the region of the
North-east of Ireland, but I was not then aware that it
had been dealt with on mathematical principles by so
eminent a mathematician. The bulging of the crust
is a necessary consequence of the absence of plication
of the strata due to the extrusion of this enormous
quantity of molten lava; and the intrusion of
thousands of dykes over the North-east of Ireland,
unaccompanied by foldings of the strata, must have
added a horizontal space of several thousand feet to
that region.[11]

[1] A peculiar form of crystalline quartz first recognized in this rock by
a distinguished German petrologist, the late Prof. A. von Lasaulx, who
visited the district in 1876.

[2] Sir A. Geikie has disputed the correctness of the view, which I advocated
as far back as 1874, that the trachytic lavas of Antrim are the earliest
products of volcanic action; but at the time he wrote his paper on the
volcanic history of these islands, it was not known that pebbles of this
trachyte are largely distributed amongst the ash-beds which occur in the
very midst of the overlying basaltic sheets, as I shall have to explain
later on. This discovery puts the question at rest as regards the
relations of the two sets of rocks.

[3] This remarkable section at the chalk quarries of Templepatrick the
author has figured and described in the Physical Geology and Geography
of Ireland, p. 99, 2nd edit. (1891), where the reader will find the subject
discussed more fully than can be done here.

[4] These pebbles were first noticed by Mr. McHenry, of the Irish
Geological Survey, in 1890.

[5] The vertical position of the columns of the Giant's Causeway is
rather enigmatical. The Causeway cannot be a dyke, as has often been
supposed, otherwise the columns would have been horizontal, i.e., at
right angles to the sides of the dyke. Mr. R. G. Symes, of the Geological
Survey, has suggested that the Causeway columns have been
vertically lowered between two lines of fault, and that originally they
formed a portion of the tier of beautiful columns seen in the cliff above,
and known as "The Organ."

A. Geikie in the monograph already referred to, loc. cit., p. 101, et seq.

CHAPTER III.

ISLAND OF MULL AND ADJOINING COAST.


The Island of Mull, with the adjoining districts of
Morvern and Ardnamurchan, forms the more southern
of the two chief centres of Tertiary volcanic eruptions
in the West of Scotland, that of Skye being the more
northern. These districts have been the subject of
critical and detailed study by several geologists, from
McCulloch down to the present day; and amongst
the more recent, Sir Archibald Geikie and Professor
Judd hold the chief place. Unfortunately, the interpretation
of the volcanic phenomena by these two
accomplished observers has led them to very different
conclusions as regards several important points in the
volcanic history of these groups of islands; as, for
example, regarding the relative ages of the plateau-basalts
and the acid rocks, such as the trachytes and
granophyres; again as regards the presence of distinct
centres of eruption; and also as regards the relations
of the gabbros of Skye to the basaltic sheets. Such
being the case, it would appear the height of rashness
on the part of the writer, especially in the absence of
a detailed examination of the sections over the whole
region, to venture on a statement of opinion regarding
the points at issue; and he must, therefore, content
himself with a brief account of the phenomena as
[Pg 173]gathered from a perusal of the writings of these and
other observers,[1] guided also to some extent by the
analogous phenomena presented by the volcanic
region of the North-east of Ireland.

(a.) General Features.       As in the case of the
Antrim district, the Island of Mull and adjoining
tracts present us with the spectacle of a vast accumulation
of basaltic lava-flows, piled layer upon layer,
with intervening beds of bole and tuff, up to a thickness,
according to Geikie, of about 3,500 feet. At the
grand headland of Gribon, on the west coast, the
basaltic sheets are seen to rise in one sheer sweep to
a height of 1,600 feet, and then to stretch away with
a slight easterly dip under Ben More at a distance of
some eight miles. This mountain, the upper part of
which is formed of beds of ashes, reaches an elevation
of 3,169 feet, so that the accumulated thickness of the
beds of basalt under the higher part of the mountain
must be at least equal to the amount stated above       that
is, twice as great as the representative masses of
Antrim. The base of the volcanic series is seen at
Carsaig and Gribon to rest on Cretaceous and
Jurassic rocks, like those of Antrim; hence the
Tertiary age is fully established by the evidence of
superposition. This was further confirmed by the
discovery by the Duke of Argyll,[2] some years ago
(1850), of bands of flint-gravel and tuff, with dicotyledonous
leaves amongst the basalts of Ardtun Head.
[Pg 174]The basement beds of tuff and gravel contain, besides
pebbles of flint and chalk, others of sanidine trachyte,
showing that highly acid lavas had been extruded
and consolidated before the first eruption of the
plateau-basalts; another point of analogy between the
volcanic phenomenon of Antrim and the Inner Hebrides.
These great sheets of augitic lava extend
over the whole of the northern tract of Mull, the
Isles of Ulva and Staffa, and for a distance of several
miles inwards from the northern shore of the Sound
of Mull, covering the wild moorlands of Morvern and
Ardnamurchan, where they terminate in escarpments
and outlying masses, indicating an originally much
more extended range than at the present day. The
summits of Ben More and its neighbouring height,
Ben Buy, are formed of beds of ash and tuff. The
volcanic plateau is, according to Judd, abruptly
terminated along the southern side by a large vault,
bringing the basalt in contact with Palæozoic rocks.[3]

(b.) Granophyres.       The greater part of the tract
lying to the south of Loch na Keal, which almost
divides Mull into two islands, and extending southwards
and eastwards to the shores of the Firth of
Lorn and the Sound of Mull, is formed of a peculiar
group of acid (or highly silicated) rocks, classed under
the general term of "Granophyres." These rocks
approach towards true granites in one direction, and
through quartz-porphyry and felsite to rhyolite in
another       probably depending upon the conditions of
cooling and consolidation. In their mode of weathering
and general appearance on a large scale, they
present a marked contrast to the basic lavas with
which they are in contact from the coast of L. na
[Pg 175]Keal to that of L. Buy. The nature of this contact,
whether indicating the priority of the granophyres to
the plateau-basalts or otherwise, is a matter of dispute
between the two observers above named; but the
circumstantial account given by Sir A. Geikie,[4] accompanied
by drawings of special sections showing
this contact, appears to prove that the granophyre is
the newer of the two masses of volcanic rock, and
that it has been intruded amongst the basaltic-lavas
at a late period in the volcanic history of these islands.
A copy of one of these sketches is here given (Fig. 33),
according to which the felsite is shown to penetrate
the basaltic sheets at Alt na Searmoin in Mull; other
sections seen at Cruach Torr an Lochain, and on the
south side of Beinn Fada, appear to lead to similar
conclusions. These rocks are penetrated by numerous
basaltic dykes.



  



Fig. 33.       Section at Alt na Searmoin, Mull, to show the intrusion
of felsite (or granophyre) (b) into basalt and dolerite (a) of the plateau-basalt
series.       (Geikie.)




[Pg 176](c.) Representative Rocks of Mourne and Carlingford,
Ireland.       Assuming Sir A. Geikie's view to be
correct, it is possible that we may have in the granite
and quartz-porphyries of Mourne and Carlingford
representatives of the granites, granophyres, and other
acid rocks of the later period of Mull. The granite of
Mourne is peculiar in structure, and differs from the
ordinary type of that rock in which the silica forms
the ground mass. In the case of the granite of the
Mourne Mountains, the rock consists of a crystalline
granular aggregate of orthoclase, albite, smoke-quartz,
and mica; it is also full of drusy cavities, in which the
various minerals crystallise out in very perfect form.
As far as regards direct evidence, the age of this rock
can only be stated to be post-Carboniferous, and earlier
than certain Tertiary basaltic dykes by which it is
traversed. The granophyres of Mull are traversed by
similar dykes, which are representatives of the very
latest stage of volcanic action in the British Islands.
The author is therefore inclined to concur with Sir
A. Geikie in assigning to the granite of the Mourne
Mountains, and the representative felsitic rocks of the
Carlingford Mountains, a Tertiary age       in which case
the analogy between the volcanic phenomena of the
Inner Hebrides and of the North-east of Ireland would
seem to be complete.[5]

CHAPTER IV.

ISLE OF SKYE.


This is the largest and most important of all the
Tertiary volcanic districts, but owing to the extensive
denudation to which, in common with other Tertiary
volcanic regions of the British Isles, it has been subjected,
its present limits are very restricted comparatively
to its original extent. Not only is this evident
from the manner in which the basaltic sheets terminate
along the sea-coast in grand mural cliffs, as opposite
"Macleod's Maidens," and at the entrance to Lough
Bracadale on the western coast, but the evidence is,
according to Sir A. Geikie, still more striking along the
eastern coast; showing that the Jurassic, and other older
rocks there visible, were originally buried deep under
the basaltic sheets which have been stripped from off
that part of the country. These great plateau-basalts
occupy about three-fourths of the entire island along
the western and northern areas, rising into terraced
mountains over 2,000 feet in height, and are deeply
furrowed by glens and arms of the sea, along which the
general structure of the tableland is laid open, sometimes
for leagues at a time.

It is towards the south-eastern part of the island
that the most interesting and important phenomena
are centred; for here we meet with representatives
[Pg 178]of the acid (or highly silicated) group of rocks, and of
remarkable beds of gabbro, which have long attracted
the attention of petrologists. These latter beds,
throughout a considerable distance round the flanks
of the Cuillin Hills, are interposed between the acid
rocks and the plateau-basalts; but towards the north,
on approaching Lough Sligahan, the acid rocks, consisting
of granophyres, quartz-porphyries, and hornblendic-granitites,
are in direct contact with the
plateau-basalts; and, according to the very circumstantial
account of Sir A. Geikie, are intrusive into
them; not only sending veins into the basaltic sheets,
but also producing a marked alteration in their structure
where they approach the newer intrusive mass.
Equally circumstantial is the same author's account of
the relations of the granophyres to the gabbros,[1] as seen
at Meall Dearg and the western border of the Cuillin
Hills       where the former rock may be seen to send
numerous veins into the latter. Not only is this so,
but the granophyre is frequently seen to truncate,
and abruptly terminate some of the basaltic dykes by
which the basic sheets are traversed       as in the neighbourhood
of Beinn na Dubhaic. All these phenomena
strongly remind us of the conditions of similar rocks
amongst the mountains of Mourne and Carlingford in
Ireland; where, at Barnaveve, the syenite (or hornblendic
quartz-felsite) is seen to break through the
masses of olivine gabbro, and send numerous veins
into this latter rock.[2]

The interpretation here briefly sketched differs
[Pg 179]widely from that arrived at by Professor Judd. The
granitoid masses of the Red Mountains (Beinn Dearg)
and the neighbouring heights are, in his view, the
roots of the great volcano from which were erupted
the various lavas; the earlier eruptions producing
the acid lavas, to be followed by the gabbros, and
these by the plateau-basaltic sheets, which stretch
away towards the north and west into several peninsulas.
Thus he holds that "the rocks of basic composition
were ejected subsequently to those of the
acid variety," and appeals to various sections in confirmation
of this view.[3] To reconcile these views is
at present impossible; but as the controversy between
these two observers is probably not yet closed, there
is room for hope that the true interpretation of the
relations of these rocks to each other will ere long
be fully established.

CHAPTER V.

THE SCUIR OF EIGG.


Amongst the more remarkable of the smaller islets
are those of Eigg, Rum, Canna, and Muck, lying between
Mull on the south and Skye on the north, and
undoubtedly at one time physically connected together.
The Island of Eigg is especially remarkable
for the fact, as stated by Geikie, that here we have
the one solitary case of "a true superficial stream of
acid lava       that of the Scuir of Eigg."[1] (Fig. 34.)
This forms a sinuous ridge, composed of pitchstone
of several kinds, of over two miles in length, rising
from the midst of a tableland of bedded basalt and
tuff to a height of 1,289 feet above the ocean; the
plateau-basalt is traversed by basaltic dykes, ranging
in a N.W.-S.E. direction. But what is specially remarkable
is the evidence afforded by an examination
of the course of the Scuir, that it follows the channel
of an ancient river-valley, which has been hollowed
out in the surface of the plateau. The course of this
channel is indicated by the presence of a deposit of
river-gravel, which in some places forms a sort of
cushion between the base of the Scuir and the side of
the channel. Over this gravel-bed the viscous pitchstone-lava
appears to have flowed, taking possession
[Pg 181]of the river-channel, and also of the beds of several
small tributary streams which flowed into the channel
of the Scuir. The recent date of the pitchstone forming
this remarkable mural ridge, once occupying the bed of
a river-channel, is shown by the fact that the basaltic
dykes which traverse the plateau-basalts are truncated
by the river-gravel, which is, therefore, more recent;
and, as we have seen, the pitchstone stream is more
recent than the river-gravel. But at the time when
this last volcanic eruption took place, the physical
geography of the whole region must have been very
different from that of the present time. From the
character and composition of the pebbles in the old
river-bed, amongst which are Cambrian sandstone,
quartzite, clay-slate, and white Jurassic limestone,
Sir A. Geikie concludes that when the river was
flowing, the island must have been connected with
the mainland to the east where the parent masses
of these pebbles are found.



  



Fig. 34.       View of the Scuir of Eigg from the east. The lower
portion of the mountain is formed of bedded basalt, or dolerite with
numerous dykes and veins of basalt, felstone, and pitchstone; the upper
cliff, or Scuir, is composed of pitchstone of newer age, the remnant of a
lava flow which once filled a river channel in the basaltic sheets. A
dyke, or sheet, of porphyry is seen to be interposed between the Scuir
and the basaltic sheets.       (After Geikie.)




[Pg 182]Effects of Denudation.       The position of the Scuir
of Eigg and its relations to the basaltic sheets show
the enormous amount of denudation which these
latter have undergone since the stream of pitchstone-lava
filled the old river channel. The walls, or banks,
of the channel have been denuded away, thus converting
the pitchstone casting into a projecting wall
of rock. That it originally extended outwards into
the ocean to a far greater distance than at present is
evident from the abruptly truncated face of the cliff;
and yet this remarkable volcanic mass seems to have
been, perhaps, the most recent exhibition of volcanic
action to be found in the British Isles. It is perhaps,
on this account, the most striking of the numerous
examples exhibited throughout the West of Scotland
and the North-east of Ireland of the enormous amount
of denudation to which these districts have been subjected
since the extinction of the volcanic fires; and
this at a period to which we cannot assign a date
more ancient than that of the Pliocene. Yet, let us
consider for a moment to what physical vicissitudes
these districts have been subjected since that epoch.
Assuming, as we may with confidence, that the volcanic
eruptions were subaërial, and that the tracts
covered by the plateau-basalts were in the condition
of dry land when the eruptions commenced, in this
[Pg 183]condition they continued in the main throughout the
period of volcanic activity. But the eruptions had
scarcely ceased, and the lava floods and dykes become
consolidated, before the succeeding glacial epoch
set in; when the snows and glaciers of the Scottish
Highlands gradually descending from their original
mountain heights, and spreading outwards in all
directions, ultimately enveloped the whole of the
region we are now considering until it was entirely
concealed beneath a mantle of ice moving slowly,
but irresistibly, outwards towards the Atlantic, crossing
the deep channels, such as the Sound of Mull and
the Minch, climbing up the sides of opposing rocks
and islands until even the Outer Hebrides and the
North-east of Ireland were covered by one vast
mantle of ice and snow. The movement of such a
body of ice over the land must have been attended
with a large amount of abrasion of the rocky floor;
nor have the evidences of that abrasion entirely disappeared
even at the present day. We still detect
the grooves and scorings on the rock-surfaces where
they have been protected by a coating of boulder
clay; and we still find the surface strewn with the
blocks and débris of that mighty ice-flood.

But whatever may have been the amount of erosion
caused by the great ice-sheet, it was chiefly confined
to the more or less horizontal surface-planes. Erosion
of another kind was to succeed, and to produce more
lasting effects on the configuration of the surface. On
the disappearance of the ice-sheet, an epoch characterised
by milder conditions of climate set in. This
was accompanied by subsidence and submersion of
large tracts of the land during the Interglacial stage;
so that the sea rose to heights of several hundred feet
[Pg 184]above the present level, and has left behind stratified
gravels with shells at these elevations in protected
places. During this period of depression and of subsequent
re-emergence the wave-action of the Atlantic
waters must have told severely on the coast and islands,
wearing them into cliffs and escarpments, furrowing
out channels and levelling obstructions. Such action
has gone on down to the present day. The North-west
of Scotland and of Ireland has been subjected
throughout a very lengthened period to the wear and
tear of the Atlantic billows. In the case of the former,
the remarkable breakwater which nature has thrown
athwart the North-west Highlands in the direction of
the waves, forming the chain of islands constituting
the Outer Hebrides, and composed of very tough
Archæan gneiss and schist, has done much to retard the
inroads which the waves might otherwise have made
on the Isle of Skye; while Coll and Tiree, composed
of similar materials, have acted with similar beneficent
effect for Mull and the adjoining coasts. But such is
the tremendous power of the Atlantic billows when
impelled by westerly winds, that to their agency must
be mainly attributed the small size of the volcanic
land-surfaces as compared with their original extent,
and the formation of those grand headlands which
are presented by the igneous masses of Skye, Ardnamurchan,
and Mull towards the west. Rain and river
action, supplemented by that of glaciers, have also
had a share in eroding channels and wearing down
the upper surface of the ground, with the result we at
present behold in the wild and broken scenery of the
Inner Hebrides and adjoining coast.

CHAPTER VI.

ISLE OF STAFFA.


Reference has been made to this remarkable island
in a former page, but some more extended notice is
desirable before leaving the region of the Inner
Hebrides. Along with the islands of Pladda, Treshnish,
and Blackmore, Staffa is one of the outlying
volcanic islands of the group, being distant about six
miles from the coast of Mull, and indicates the minimum
distance to which the plateau-basaltic sheets
originally extended in the direction of the old marginal
lands of Tiree and Coll. The island consists of successive
sheets of bedded basaltic lava, with partings
of tuff, one of which of considerable thickness is shown
to lie at the base of the cliff on the south-west side of
the island.[1] The successive lava-sheets present great
varieties of structure, like those on the north coast of
Antrim; some being amorphous, others columnar,
with either straight or bent columns. The lava-sheet
out of which Fingal's Cave is excavated consists of
vertical prisms, beautifully formed, and surmounted
by an amorphous mass of the same material. At the
entrance of the Boat Cave we have a somewhat similar
[Pg 186]arrangement of the columns;[2] but at the Clam-shell
Cave the prisms are curved, indicating some movement
in the viscous mass before they had been fully
consolidated.

Fingal's Cave is called after the celebrated prince
of Morvern (or Morven), a province of ancient Caledonia.
He is supposed to have been the father of
Ossian, the Celtic bard rendered famous by Macpherson.
The cave, one of many which pierce the coast-cliffs
of Western Scotland, is 227 feet in length,
166 feet in height, and 40 feet in width. On all sides
regular columns of basalt, some entire, others broken,
rise out of the water and support the roof. The cave
is only accessible in calm weather.

(Jukes and Geikie), 3rd edition, p. 277.

PART V.

PRE-TERTIARY VOLCANIC ROCKS.




CHAPTER I.

THE DECCAN TRAP-SERIES OF INDIA.


The great outpourings of augitic lava of Tertiary and
recent times which we have been considering appear
to have been anticipated in several parts of the world,
more especially in Peninsular India and in Africa,
and it is desirable that we should devote a few pages
to the description of these remarkable volcanic formations,
as they resemble, both in their mode of
occurrence and general structure, some of the great
lava-floods of a more recent period we have been considering.
Of the districts to be described, the first
which claims our notice is the Deccan.

(a.) Extent of the Volcanic Plateau.       The volcanic
plateau of the Deccan stretches from the borders of
the Western Ghats and the sea-coast near Bombay
inland to Amarantak, at the head of the Narbudda
River (long. 82° E.), and from Belgaum (lat. 15° 31' N.)
to near Goona (lat. 24° 30'). The vast area thus
circumscribed is far from representing the original
extent of the tract overspread by the lava-floods, as
outlying fragments of these lavas are found as far
east as long. 84° E. in one direction, and at Kattiwar
[Pg 188]and Cutch in another. The present area, however, is
estimated to be not less than 200,000 square miles.[1]

(b.) Nature and Thickness of the Lava-flows.       This
tract is overspread almost continuously by sheets of
basaltic lava, with occasional bands of fresh-water strata
containing numerous shells, figured and described by
Hislop, and believed by him to be of Lower Eocene
age. The lava-sheets vary considerably in character,
ranging from finest compact basalt to coarsely
crystalline dolerite, in which olivine is abundant.
The columnar structure is not prevalent, the rock
being either amorphous, or weathering into concentric
shells. Volcanic ash, or bole, is frequently found
separating the different lava-flows; and in the upper
amygdaloidal sheets numerous secondary minerals are
found, such as quartz, agate and jasper, stilbite and
chlorite. The total thickness of the whole series,
where complete, is about 6,000 feet, divided as follows:




1. Upper trap; with ash and inter-trappean beds
1,500
feet


2. Middle trap; sheets of basalt and ash
4,000
"


3. Lower trap; basalt with inter-trappean beds
500
"



6,000
"




Throughout the region here described these great
sheets of volcanic rock are everywhere approximately
horizontal, and constitute a table-land of 3,000 to
4,000 feet in elevation, breaking off in terraced escarpments,
and penetrated by deep river-valleys, of which
the Narbudda is the most important. The foundation
[Pg 189]rock is sometimes metamorphic schist, or gneiss,
at other times sandstone referred by Hislop to
Jurassic age; and in no single instance has a volcanic
crater or focus of eruption been observed. But outside
the central trappean area volcanic foci are numerous,
as in Cutch, the Rajhipla Hills and the Lower Narbudda
valley. The original excessive fluidity of the
Deccan trap is proved by the remarkable horizontality
of the beds over large areas, and the extensive
regions covered by very thin sheets of basalt or dolerite.

(c.) Geological Age.       As regards the geological age
of this great volcanic series much uncertainty exists,
owing to the absence of marine forms in the inter-trappean
beds. One single species, Cardita variabilis,
has been observed as occurring in these beds, and in
the limestone below the base of the trap at Dudukur.
The facies of the forms in this limestone is Tertiary;
but there is a remarkable absence of characteristic
genera. On the other hand, Mr. Blanford states that
the bedded traps are seen to underlie the Eocene
Tertiary strata with Nummulites in Guzerat and
Cutch,[2] which would appear to determine the limit of
their age in one direction. On balancing the evidence,
however, it is tolerably clear that the volcanic eruptions
commenced towards the close of the Cretaceous
period, and continued into the commencement of the
Tertiary, thus bridging over the interval between the
two epochs; and since the greater sheets have been
exposed throughout the whole of the Tertiary and
Quarternary periods, it is not surprising if they have
suffered enormously from denuding agencies, and
that any craters or cones of eruption that may once
have existed have disappeared.

[Pg 190]



CHAPTER II.

ABYSSINIAN TABLE-LANDS.


Another region in which the volcanic phenomena
bear a remarkable analogy to those of Central India,
just described, is that of Abyssinia. Nor are these
tracts so widely separated that they may not be
considered as portions of one great volcanic area
extending from Abyssinia, through Southern Arabia,
into Cutch and the Deccan, in the one direction,
while the great volcanic cones of Kenia and Kilimanjaro,
with their surrounding tracts of volcanic matter,
may be the extreme prolongations in the other. Along
this tract volcanic operations are still active in the
Gulf of Aden; and cones quite unchanged in form,
and evidently of very recent date, abound in many
places along the coast both of Arabia and Africa.
The volcanic formations of this tract are, however,
much more recent than those which occupy the
high plateaux of Central and Southern Abyssinia
of which we are about to speak.

(a.) Physical Features.       Abyssinia forms a compact
region of lofty plateaux intersected by deep
valleys, interposed between the basin of the Nile on
the west, and the low-lying tract bordering the Red
Sea and the Indian Ocean on the east. The plateaux
are deeply intersected by valleys and ravines, giving
[Pg 191]birth to streams which feed the head waters of the
Blue Nile (Bahr el Arak) and the Atbara. Several
fine lakes lie in the lap of the mountains, of which
the Zana, or Dembia, is the largest, and next Ashangi,
visited by the British army on its march to Magdala
in 1868, and which, from its form and the volcanic
nature of the surrounding hills, appears to occupy
the hollow of an extinct crater. The table-land of
Abyssinia reaches its highest elevation along the
eastern and southern margin, where its average
height may be 8,000 to 10,000 feet; but some peaks
rise to a height of 12,000 to 15,000 feet in Shoa and
Ankobar.[1]

(b.) Basaltic Lava Sheets.       An enormous area of
this country seems to be composed of volcanic rocks
chiefly in the form of sheets of basaltic lava, which
rise into high plateaux, and break off in steep       sometimes
precipitous       mural escarpments along the
sides of the valleys. These are divisible into the
following series:       

(1) The Ashangi Volcanic Series.       The earliest
forerunners of the more recent lavas seem to have
been erupted in Jurassic times, in the form of sheets
of contemporaneous basalt or dolerite amongst the
Antola limestones which are of this period. But the
great mass of the volcanic rocks are much more
recent, and may be confidently referred to the late
Cretaceous or early Tertiary epochs. Their resemblance
to the great trappean series of Western India,
even in minute particulars, is referred to by Mr.
Blanford, who suggests the view that they belong
to one and the same great series of lava-flows extruded
over the surface of this part of the globe.
[Pg 192]This view is inherently probable. They consist of
basalts and dolerites, generally amygdaloidal, with
nodules of agate and zeolite, and are frequently coated
with green-earth (chlorite). Beds of volcanic ash
or breccia also frequently occur, and often contain
augite crystals. At Senafé, hills of trachyte passing
into claystone and basalt were observed by Mr.
Blanford, but it is not clear what are their relations
to the plateau-basaltic sheets.[2]

(2) Magdala Volcanic Series.       This is a more recent
group of volcanic lavas, chiefly distinguished from
the lower, or Ashangi, group, by the occurrence of
thick beds of trachyte, usually more or less crystalline,
and containing beautiful crystals of sanidine.
The beds of trachyte break off in precipitous scarps,
and being of great thickness and perfectly horizontal,
are unusually conspicuous. Mr. Blanford says, with
regard to this group, that there is a remarkable resemblance
in its physical aspect to the scenery of the
Deccan and the higher valleys of the Western Ghats
of India, but the peculiarities of the landscape are
exaggerated in Abyssinia. Many of the trachytic
beds are brecciated and highly columnar; sedimentary
beds are also interstratified with those of volcanic
origin. The Magdala group is unconformable to
that of Ashangi in some places. A still more recent
group of volcanic rocks appears to occur in the
neighbourhood of Senafé, consisting of amorphous
masses of trachyte, often so fine-grained and compact
as to pass into claystone and to resemble sandstone.
At Akub Teriki the rocks appear to be in the immediate
vicinity of an ancient vent of eruption.

From what has been said, it will be apparent that
[Pg 193]Abyssinia offers volcanic phenomena of great interest
for the observer. There is considerable variety in
the rock masses, in their mode of distribution, and
in the scenery which they produce. The extensive
horizontal sheets of lava are suggestive of fissure-eruption
rather than of eruption through volcanic
craters; and although these may have once been in
existence, denudation has left no vestiges of them at
the present day. In all these respects the resemblance
of the volcanic phenomena to those of Peninsular
India is remarkably striking; it suggests the
view that they are contemporaneous as regards the
time of their eruption, and similar as regards their
mode of formation.

CHAPTER III.

CAPE COLONY.


Basalt of the Plateau.       The extensive sheets of
plateau-basalt forming portions of the Neuweld range
and the elevated table-land of Cape Colony, may be
regarded as forerunners of those just described, and
possibly contemporaneous with the Ashangi volcanic
series of Abyssinia. The great basaltic sheets of
the Cape Colony are found capping the highest
elevations of the Camderboo and Stormberg ranges,
as well as overspreading immense areas of less
elevated land, to an extent, according to Professor
A. H. Green, of at least 120,000 square miles.[1]
Amongst these sheets, innumerable dykes, and masses
of solid lava which filled the old vents of eruption,
are to be observed. The floor upon which the lava-floods
have been poured out generally consists of the
"Cave Sandstone," the uppermost of a series of
deposits which had previously been laid down over
the bed of an extensive lake which occupied this
part of Africa during the Mesozoic period. After
the deposition of this sandstone, the volcanic forces
appear to have burst through the crust, and from
[Pg 195]vents and fissures great floods of augitic lava, with
beds of tuff, invaded the region occupied by the
waters of the lake. The lava-sheets have since
undergone extensive denudation, and are intersected
by valleys and depressions eroded down through
them into the sandstone floor beneath; and though
the precise geological period at which they were
extruded must remain in doubt, it appears probable
that they may be referred to that of the Trias.[2]

there is little information regarding the volcanic region here referred to.

VOLCANIC ROCKS OF PAST GEOLOGICAL PERIODS
OF THE BRITISH ISLES.


It is beyond the scope of this work to describe the
volcanic rocks of pre-Tertiary times over various parts
of the globe. The subject is far too large to be treated
otherwise than in a distinct and separate essay. I
will therefore content myself with a brief enumeration
of the formations of the British Isles in which contemporaneous
volcanic action has been recognised.[1]

There is little evidence of volcanic action throughout
the long lapse of time extending backwards from
the Cretaceous to the Triassic epochs, that is to say,
throughout the Mesozoic or Secondary period, and it
is not till we reach the Palæozoic strata that evidence
of volcanic action unmistakably presents itself.

Permian Period.       In Ayrshire, and in the western
parts of Devonshire, beds of felspathic porphyry, felstone
and ash are interstratified with strata believed
to be of Permian age. In Devonshire these have only
recently been recognised by Dr. Irving and the author
as of Permian age, the strata consisting of beds of
breccia, lying at the base of the New Red Sandstone.
Those of Ayrshire have long been recognised as of
[Pg 197]the same period; as they rest unconformably on the
coal measures, and consist of porphyrites, melaphyres,
and tuffs of volcanic origin.

Carboniferous Period.       Volcanic rocks occur
amongst the coal-measures of England and Scotland,
while they are also found interbedded with the
Carboniferous Limestone series in Derbyshire, Scotland,
and Co. Limerick in Ireland. The rocks consist
chiefly of basalt, dolerite, melaphyre and felstone.

Devonian Period.       Volcanic rocks of Devonian
age occur in the South of Scotland, consisting of
felstone-porphyries and melaphyres; also at Boyle,
in Roscommon, and amongst the Glengariff beds
near Killarney in Ireland.

Upper Silurian Period.       Volcanic rocks of this
stage are only known in Ireland, on the borders of
Cos. Mayo and Galway, west of Lough Mask, and at
the extreme headland of the Dingle Promontory in
Co. Kerry. They consist of porphyrites, felstones
and tuffs, or breccias, contemporaneously erupted
during the Wenlock and Ludlow stages. Around
the flanks of Muilrea, beds of purple quartz-felstone
with tuff are interstratified with the Upper Silurian
grits and slates.

Lower Silurian Period.       Volcanic action was developed
on a grand scale during the Arenig and Caradoc-Bala
stages, both in Wales and the Lake district,
and in the Llandeilo stage in the South of Scotland.
The felspathic lavas, with their associated beds of
tuff and breccia, rise into some of the grandest mountain
crests of North Wales, such as those of Cader
Idris, Aran Mowddwy, Arenig and Moel Wyn. A
similar series is also represented in Ireland, ranging
from Wicklow to Waterford, forming a double group
[Pg 198]of felstones, porphyries, breccias, and ash-beds, with
dykes of basalt and dolerite. The same series again
appears amidst the Lower Silurian beds of Co. Louth,
near Drogheda.

Metamorphic Series presumably of Lower Silurian
Age.       If, as seems highly probable, the great metamorphic
series of Donegal and Derry are the representatives
in time of the Lower Silurian series,
some of the great sheets of felspathic and hornblendic
trap which they contain are referable to this
epoch. These rocks have undergone a change in
structure along with the sedimentary strata of which
they were originally formed, so that the sheets of (presumably)
augitic lava have been converted into hornblende-rock
and schist. Similar masses occur in North
Mayo, south of Belderg Harbour.

Cambrian Period.       In the Pass of Llanberis, along
the banks of Llyn Padarn, masses of quartz-porphyry,
felsite and agglomerate, or breccia, indicate volcanic
action during this stage. These rocks underlie beds
of conglomerate, slate and grit of the Lower Cambrian
epoch, and, as Mr. Blake has shown, are clearly
of volcanic origin, and pass upwards into the sedimentary
strata of the period. A similar group, first
recognised by Professor Sedgwick, stretches southwards
from Bangor along the southern shore of the
Menai Straits. Again, we find the volcanic eruptions
of this epoch at St. David's, consisting of diabasic and
felsitic lava, with beds of ash; and in the centre of
England, amongst the grits and slates of Charnwood
Forest presumably of Cambrian age, various felstones,
porphyries, and volcanic breccias are found.

Thus it will be seen that every epoch, from the
earliest stage of the Cambrian to the Permian, in the
[Pg 199]British Isles, gives evidence of the existence of volcanic
action; from which we may infer that the
originating cause, whatever it may be, has been in
operation throughout all past geological time represented
by living forms. The question of the condition
of our globe in Archæan times, and earlier, is
one which only can be discussed on theoretic ground,
and is beyond the scope of this work.

Geological Society (1891) for the latest view of this subject.

CHAPTER I.

THE ERUPTION OF KRAKATOA IN 1883.


I propose to introduce here some account of one
of the most terrible outbursts of volcanic action
that have taken place in modern times; namely,
the eruption of the volcano of Krakatoa (a corruption
of Rakata) in the strait of Sunda, between
the islands of Sumatra and Java, in the year 1883.
The Malay Archipelago, of which this island once
formed a member, is a region where volcanic action
is constant, and where the outbursts are exceptionally
violent. With the great island of Borneo
as a solid, non-volcanic central core, a line of volcanic
islands extends from Chedooba off the coast
of Pegu through Sumatra, Java, Sumbawa, Flores,
and, reaching the Moluccas, stretches northwards
through the Philippines into Japan and Kamtschatka.
This is probably the most active volcanic belt in the
world, and the recent terrible earthquake and eruption
in Japan (November, 1891) gives proof that the
volcanic forces are as powerful and destructive as ever.[1]

[Pg 202](a.) Dormant Condition down to 1680.       Down to
the year 1680, this island, although from its form and
structure evidently volcanic, appears to have been
in a dormant state; its sides were covered with
luxuriant forests, and numerous habitations dotted
its shore. But in May of that year an eruption
occurred, owing to which the aspect of Krakatoa
as described by Vogel was entirely changed; the
surface of the island when this writer passed on
his voyage to Sumatra appeared burnt up and arid,
while blocks of incandescent rock were being hurled
into the air from four distinct points. After this first
recorded eruption the island relapsed into a state of
repose, and except for a stream of molten lava which
issued from the northern extremity, there was no
evidence of its dangerous condition. The luxuriant
vegetation of the tropics speedily re-established
itself, and the volcano was generally regarded as
"extinct."[2] History repeats itself; and the history
of Vesuvius was repeated in the case of Krakatoa.

[Pg 203]

Of The Krakatoa Group Of Islands Before
The Eruption Of August 1883 (From Admiralty Chart)




(b.) Eruption of May, 1883.[3]       On the morning of
May 20, 1883, the inhabitants of Batavia, of Buitenzorg,
and neighbouring localities, were surprised by a
confused noise, mingled with detonations resembling
the firing of artillery. The phenomena commenced
between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, and
soon acquired such intensity as to cause general
alarm. The detonations were accompanied by
tremblings of the ground, of buildings and various
objects contained in dwellings; but it was generally
admitted that these did not proceed from earthquake
shocks, but from atmospheric vibrations. No deviation
of the magnetic needle was observed at the Meteorological
Institute of Batavia; but a vertical oscillation
was apparent, and persons who listened with the ear
placed on the ground, even during the most violent
detonations, could hear no subterranean noise whatever.
It became clear that the sounds came from
some volcano burst into activity; but it is strange that
for two whole days it remained uncertain what was
the particular volcano to which the phenomena were
to be referred. The detonations appeared, indeed, to
come from the direction of Krakatoa; but from
[Pg 204]Serang, Anjer, and Merak, localities situated much
nearer Krakatoa than Batavia, the telegraph announced
that neither detonations nor atmospheric
vibrations had been perceived. The distance between
Batavia and Krakatoa is ninety-three English miles.
The doubts thus experienced were, however, soon put
to rest by the arrival of an American vessel under the
command of A. R. Thomas, and of other ships which
hailed from the straits of Sunda. From their accounts
it was ascertained that in the direction of Krakatoa
the heavens were clouded with ashes, and that a grand
column of smoke, illumined from time to time by
flashes of flame, arose from above the island. Thus
after a repose of more than two hundred years, "the
peaceable isle of Krakatoa, inhabited, and covered by
thick forests, was suddenly awakened from its condition
of fancied security."



  



Fig. 36.       Section from Verlaten Island through Krakatoa, to show
the outline before and after the eruption of August, 1888. The continuous
line shows the former; the dotted line and shading, the latter;
from which it will be observed that the original island has to a large
extent disappeared. The line of section is shown in Fig. 35.




(c.) Form and Appearance of the Island before the
Eruption of 1883.       From surveys made in 1849 and
1881, it would appear that the island of Krakatoa
consisted of three mountains or groups of mountains
(Figs. 35, 36); the southern formed by the cone of Rakata
(properly so called), rising with a scarped face
above the sea to a height of over 800 mètres (2,622
feet). Adjoining this cone, and rising from the centre of
[Pg 205]the island, came the group of Danan, composed of
many summits, probably forming part of the enceinte
annulaire of a crater. And near the northern
extremity of the isle, a third group of mammelated
heights could be recognised under the general name
of Perboewatan, from which issued several obsidian
lava-flows, with a steep slope; these dated back perhaps
to the period of the first known eruption of 1680.
This large and mountainous island as it existed at the
beginning of May, 1883, has been entirely destroyed
by the terrible eruptions of that year, with the exception
of the peripheric rim (composed of the most
ancient of the volcanic rocks, andesite), of which Verlaten
Island and Rakata formed a part, and one very
small islet, which is noted on the maps as "rots"
(rock), and on the new map of the Straits of Sunda
of the Dutch Navy as that of "Bootsmansrots."[4]

As shown by the map in the Report of the Royal
Society, the group of islands which existed previous
to 1883 were but the unsubmerged portions of one
vast volcanic crater, built up of a remarkable variety
of lava allied to the andesite of the Java volcanoes,
but having a larger percentage of silica, and hence
falling under the head of "enstatite-dacite."[5] That
these volcanic rocks are of very recent origin is shown
by the fact, ascertained by Verbeek, that beneath them
occur deposits of Post-Tertiary age, and that these in
turn rest on the Tertiary strata which are widely distributed
through Sumatra, Java, and the adjoining
islands. According to the reasoning of Professor
Judd, the Krakatoa group at an early period of its
history presented the form of a magnificent crater-cone,
several miles in circumference at the base, which
[Pg 206]subsequent eruptions shattered into fragments or blew
into the air in the form of dust, ashes, and blocks
of lava, while the central part collapsed and fell in,
leaving a vast circular ring like the ancient crater of
Somma (see Fig. 6, p. 43), and he supposes the
former eruptions to have been on a scale exceeding
in magnificence those which have caused such
world-wide interest within the last few years.

(d.) Eruption of 26th to 28th of August.       It was,
as we have seen, in the month of May that, in the
language of Chev. Verbeek, "the volcano of Krakatoa
chose to announce in a high voice to the inhabitants
of the Archipelago that, although almost nothing
amongst the many colossal volcanic mountains of the
Indies, it yielded to none of them in regard to its power."
These eruptions were, however, only premonitory of
the tremendous and terrible explosion which was to
commence on Sunday, the 26th of August, and which
continued for several days subsequently. A little
after noon of that day, a rumbling noise accompanied
by short and feeble explosions was heard at Buitenzorg,
coming from the direction of Krakatoa; and
similar sounds were heard at Anjer and Batavia a
little later. Soon these detonations augmented in
intensity, especially about five o'clock in the evening;
and news was afterwards received that the sounds
had been heard in the isle of Java. These sounds
increased still more during the night, so that few
persons living on the west side of the isle of Java
were able to sleep. At seven in the morning there
came a crash so formidable, that those who had hoped
for a little sleep at Buitenzorg leaped from their beds.
Meanwhile the sky, which had up to this time been
clear, became overcast, so that by ten o'clock it
[Pg 207]became necessary to have recourse to lamps, and the
air became charged with vapour. Occasional shocks
of earthquake were now felt. Darkness became
general all over the straits and the bordering coasts.
Showers of ashes began to fall. The repeated shocks
of earthquake, and the rapid discharges of subterranean
artillery, all combined to show that an eruption
of even greater violence than that of May was in
progress at the isle of Krakatoa.

But the most interested witnesses to this terrible
outburst were those on board the ships plying through
the straits. Amongst these was the Charles Bal, a
British vessel under the command of Captain Watson.
This ship was ten miles south of the volcano on Sunday
afternoon, and therefore well in sight of the island
at the time when the volcano had entered upon its
paroxysmal state of action. Captain Watson describes
the island as being covered by a dense black cloud,
while sounds like the discharges of artillery occurred
at intervals of a second of time; and a crackling noise
(probably arising from the impact of fragments of
rock ascending and descending in the atmosphere)
was heard by those on board. These appearances
became so threatening towards five o'clock in the
evening, that the commander feared to continue his
voyage and began to shorten sail. From five to six
o'clock a rain of pumice in large pieces, quite warm,
fell upon the ship, which was one of those that escaped
destruction during this terrible night.[6]

(e.) Electrical Phenomena.       During this eruption,
electrical phenomena of great splendour were observed.
[Pg 208]Captain Wooldbridge, viewing the eruption
in the afternoon of the 26th from a distance of forty
miles, speaks of a great vapour-cloud looking like an
immense wall being momentarily lighted up "by
bursts of forked lightning like large serpents rushing
through the air. After sunset this dark wall resembled
a blood-red curtain, with edges of all shades of
yellow, the whole of a murky tinge, through which
gleamed fierce flashes of lightning." As Professor
Judd observes, the abundant generation of atmospheric
electricity is a familiar phenomenon in all
volcanic eruptions on a grand scale. The steam-jets
rushing through the orifices of the earth's crust
constitute an enormous hydro-electrical engine, and
the friction of the ejected materials striking against
one another in their ascent and descent also does
much in the way of generating electricity.[7] It has
been estimated by several observers that the column of
watery vapour ascended to a height of from twelve to
seventeen and even twenty-three miles; and on reaching
the upper strata of the atmosphere, it spread itself
out in a vast canopy resembling "the pine-tree" form
of Vesuvian eruptions; and throughout the long night
of the 27th this canopy continued to extend laterally,
and the particles of dust which it enclosed began to
descend slowly through the air.

(f.) Formation of Waves.       This tremendous outburst
of volcanic forces, which to a greater or less
extent influenced the entire surface of the globe, gave
rise to waves which traversed both air and ocean; and
in consequence of the large number of observatories
scattered all over the globe, and the excellence and
delicacy of the instruments of observation, we are
[Pg 209]put in possession of the remarkable results which
have been obtained from the collection of the observations
in the hands of competent specialists.
The results are related in extenso in the Report
of the Royal Society, illustrated by maps and diagrams,
and are worthy of careful study by those
interested in terrestrial phenomena. A brief summary
is all that can be given here, but it will probably
suffice to bring home to the reader the magnitude
and grandeur of the eruption.

The vibrations or waves generated in August, 1883,
at Krakatoa may be arranged under three heads:
(1) Atmospheric Waves; (2) Sound Waves; and (3)
Oceanic Waves; which I will touch upon in the order
here stated.

(1) Atmospheric Waves.       These phenomena have
been ably handled by General Strachey,[8] from a
large number of observations extending all over the
globe. From these it has been clearly established that
an atmospheric wave, originating at Krakatoa as a
centre, expanded outwards in a circular form and
travelled onwards till it became a great circle at a
distance of 180 degrees from its point of origin, after
which it still advanced, but now gradually contracting
to a node at the antipodes of Krakatoa; that is to
say, at a point over the surface of North America,
situated in lat. 6° N. and long. 72° W. (or thereabout).
Having attained this position, the wave was reflected
or reproduced, expanding outwards for 180 degrees
and travelling backwards again to Krakatoa, from
which it again started, and returning to its original
form again overspread the globe. This wonderful
repetition, due to the spherical form of the earth, was
[Pg 210]observed no fewer than seven times, though with such
diminished force as ultimately to be outside the range
of observation by the most sensitive instruments. It
is one of the triumphs of modern scientific appliances
that the course of such a wave, generated in a fluid
surrounding a globe, which might be demonstrated on
mathematical principles, has been actually determined
by experiments carried on over so great an area.

(2) Sound Waves.       If the sound-waves produced
at the time of maximum eruption were not quite as
far-reaching as those of the air, they were certainly
sufficiently surprising to be almost incredible, were it
not that they rest, both as regards time and character,
upon incontestible authority. The sound of the
eruption, resembling that of the discharge of artillery,
was heard not only over nearly all parts of Sumatra,
Java, and the coast of Borneo opposite the Straits of
Sunda, but at places over two thousand miles distant
from the scene of the explosions. Detailed accounts,
collected with great care, are given in the Report of
the Royal Society, from which the following are
selected as examples:       

1. At the port of Acheen, at the northern extremity of Sumatra,
distant 1,073 miles, it was supposed that the port was being
attacked, and the troops were put under arms.

2. At Singapore, distant 522 miles, two steamers were dispatched
to look out for the vessel which was supposed to be
firing guns as signals of distress.

3. At Bankok, in Siam, distant 1,413 miles, the report was
heard on the 27th; as also at Labuan, in Borneo, distant 1,037
miles.

4. At places in the Philippine Islands, distant about 1,450
miles, detonations were heard on the 27th, at the time of the
eruption.

The above places lie northwards of Krakatoa. In
[Pg 211]the opposite direction, we have the following examples:       

5. At Perth, in Western Australia, distant 1,092 miles, sounds
as of guns firing at sea were heard; and at the Victorian Plains,
distant about 1,700 miles, similar sounds were heard.

6. In South Australia, at Alice's Springs, Undoolga, and
other places at distances of over 2,000 miles, the sounds of the
eruption were also heard.

7. In a westerly direction at Dutch Bay, Ceylon, distant
2,058 miles, the sounds were heard between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m.
on the morning of the 27th of August.

8. Lastly, at the Chagos Islands, distant 2,267 miles, the detonations
were audible between 10 and 11 a.m. of the same day.

Some of the above distances are so great that we
may fail to realise them; but they will be more easily
appreciated, perhaps, if we change the localities to our
own side of the globe, and take two or three cases
with similar distances. Then, if the eruption had taken
place amongst the volcanoes of the Canaries, the detonations
would have been heard at Gibraltar, at Lisbon,
at Portsmouth, Southampton, Cork, and probably at
Dublin and Liverpool; or, again, supposing the eruption
had taken place on the coast of Iceland, the
report would have been heard all over the western
and northern coasts of the British Isles, as well as at
Amsterdam and the Hague. The enormous distance
to which the sound travelled in the case of Krakatoa
was greatly due to the fact that the explosions took
place at the surface of the sea, and the sound was
carried along that surface uninterruptedly to the
localities recorded; a range of mountains intervening
would have cut off the sound-wave at a comparatively
short distance from its source.

(3) Oceanic Waves.       As may be supposed, the
[Pg 212]eruption gave rise to great agitation of the ocean
waters with various degrees of vertical oscillation;
but according to the conclusions of Captain Wharton,
founded on numerous data, the greatest wave seems
to have originated at Krakatoa about 10 a.m. on the
27th of August, rising on the coasts of the Straits of
Sunda to a height of fifty feet above the ordinary sea-level.
This wave appears to have been observed over
at least half the globe. It travelled westwards to the
coast of Hindostan and Southern Arabia, ultimately
reaching the coasts of France and England. Eastwards
it struck the coast of Australia, New Zealand,
the Sandwich Islands, Alaska, and the western coast
of North America; so that it was only the continent
of North and South America which formed a barrier
(and that not absolute) to the circulation of this
oceanic wave all over the globe. The destruction to
life and property caused by this wave along the coasts
of Sunda was very great. Combined with the earthquake
shocks (which, however, were not very severe),
the tremendous storm of wind, the fall of ashes
and cinders, and the changes in the sea-bed, it produced
in the Straits of Sunda for some time after the
eruption a disastrous transformation. Lighthouses
had been swept away; all the old familiar landmarks
on the shore were obscured by a vast deposit of
volcanic dust; the sea itself was encumbered with
enormous quantities of floating pumice, in many
places of such thickness that no vessel could force its
way through them; and for months after the eruption
one of the principal channels was greatly obstructed
by two islands which had arisen in its midst. The
Sebesi channel was completely blocked by banks
composed of volcanic materials, and two portions of
[Pg 213]these banks rose above the sea as islands, which
received the name of "Steers Island" and "Calmeyer
Island"; but these, by the action of the waves, have
since been completely swept away, and the materials
strewn over the bed of the sea.[9]

(g.) Atmospheric Effects.       But the face of nature,
even in her most terrific and repulsive aspect, is seldom
altogether unrelieved by some traces of beauty.
In contrast to the fearful and disastrous phenomena
just described, is to be placed the splendour of the
heavens, witnessed all over the central regions of
the globe throughout a period of several months after
the eruption of 1883, which has been ably treated
by the Hon. Rollo Russell and Mr. C. D. Archibald,
in the Royal Society's Report.

When the particles of lava and ashes mingled with
vapour were projected into the air with a velocity
greater than that of a ball discharged from the largest
Armstrong gun, these materials were carried by the
prevalent trade-winds in a westerly direction, and
some of them fell on the deck of ships sailing in
the Indian Ocean as far as long. 80° E., as in the case
of the British Empire       on which the particles fell on
the 29th of August, at a distance of 1,600 miles from
Krakatoa. But far beyond this limit, the finer particles
of dust (or rather minute crystals of felspar and other
minerals), mingled with vapour of water, were carried
by the higher currents of the air as far as the Seychelles
and Africa,       not only the East coast, but also
the West, as Cape Coast Castle on the Gold Coast; to
Paramaribo, Trinidad, Panama, the Sandwich Isles,
[Pg 214]Ceylon and British India, at all of which places during
the month of September the sun assumed tints of blue
or green, as did also the moon just before and after the
appearance of the stars;[10] and from the latter end of
September and for several months, the sky was remarkable
for its magnificent coloration; passing from
crimson through purple to yellow, and melting away
in azure tints which were visible in Europe and the
British Isles; while a large corona was observed round
both the sun and moon. These beautiful sky effects
were objects of general observation throughout the
latter part of the year 1883 and commencement of the
following year.

The explanation of these phenomena may be briefly
stated. The fine particles, consisting for the most
part of translucent crystals, or fragments of crystals,
formed a canopy high up in the atmosphere, being
gradually spread over both sides of the equator till it
formed a broad belt, through which the rays of the
sun and moon were refracted. Towards dawn and
sunset they were refracted and reflected from the
facets of the crystal, and thus underwent decomposition
into the prismatic colours; as do the rays of the
sun when refracted and reflected from the particles of
moisture in a rain-cloud. The subject is one which
cannot be fully dealt with here, and is rather outside
the scope of this work.

(h.) Origin of the Eruption.       The ultimate cause of
volcanic eruptions is treated in a subsequent chapter,
nor is that of Krakatoa essentially different from
others. It was remarkable, however, both for the
magnitude of the forces evoked and the stupendous
[Pg 215]scale of the resulting phenomena. It is evident that
water played an important part in these phenomena,
though not as the prime mover;       any more than water
in the boiler of a locomotive is the prime mover in
the generation of the steam. Without the fuel in the
furnace the steam would not be produced; and the
amount of steam generated will be proportional to
the quantity and heat of the fuel in the furnace and
the quantity of water in the boiler. In the case of
Krakatoa, both these elements were enormous and
inexhaustible. The volcanic chimney (or system of
chimneys), being situated on an island, was readily
accessible to the waters of the ocean when fissures
gave them access to the interior molten matter. That
such fissures were opened we may well believe. The
earthquakes which occurred at the beginning of May,
and later on, on the 27th of that month, may indicate
movements of the crust by which water gained access.
It appears that in May the only crater in a state of
activity was that of Perboewatan; in June another
crater came into action, connected with Danan in the
centre of the island, and in August a third burst forth.
Thus there was progressive activity up to the commencement
of the grand eruption of the 26th of that
month.[11] During this last paroxysmal stage, the centre
of the island gave way and sunk down, when the waters
of the ocean gained free access, and meeting with the
columns of molten matter rising from below originated
the prodigious masses of steam which rose into the
air.

(i.) Cause of the Detonations.       The detonations
which accompanied the last great eruption are
repeatedly referred to in all the accounts. These
[Pg 216]may have been due, not only to the sudden explosions
of steam directly produced by the ocean water coming
in contact with the molten lava, but by dissociation of
the vapour of water at the critical point of temperature
into its elements of oxygen and hydrogen; the
reunion of these elements at the required temperature
would also result in explosions.

The phenomena attending this great volcanic eruption,
so carefully tabulated and critically examined,
will henceforth be referred to as constituting an epoch
in the history of volcanic action over the globe, and be
of immense value for reference and comparison.

Indies (1886). See also an Article by Sir R. S. Ball in the Contemporary

CHAPTER II.

EARTHQUAKES.


Connection of Earthquakes with Volcanic Action.       The
connection between earthquake shocks and
volcanic eruptions is now so generally recognised
that it is unnecessary to insist upon it here. All
volcanic districts over the globe are specially liable
to vibrations of the crust; but at the same time it is
to be recollected that these movements visit countries
occasionally from which volcanoes, either recent or
extinct, are absent; in which cases we may consider
earthquake shocks to be abortive attempts to originate
volcanic action.

(a.) Origin.       From the numerous observations
which have been made regarding the nature of these
phenomena by Hopkins, Lyell, and others, it seems
clearly established that earthquakes have their origin
in some sudden impact of gas, steam, or molten matter
impelled by gas or steam under high pressure, beneath
the solid crust.[1] How such impact originates we need
[Pg 218]not stop to inquire, as the cause is closely connected
with that which produces volcanic eruptions. The
effect, however, of such impact is to originate a wave
of translation through the crust, travelling outwards
from the point, or focus, on the surface immediately
over the point of impact.[2] These waves of translation
can in some cases be laid down on a map, and
are called "isoseismal curves," each curve representing
approximately an equal degree of seismal intensity;
as shown on the chart of a part of North America
affected by the great Charleston earthquake. (Fig. 37.)
Mr. Hopkins has shown that the earthquake-wave,
when it passes through rocks differing in density and
elasticity, changes in some degree not only its velocity,
but its direction; being both refracted and reflected
in a manner analogous to that of light when it passes
from one medium to another of different density.[3]
When a shock traverses the crust through a thickness
of several miles it will meet with various kinds of rock
as well as with fissures and plications of the strata,
owing to which its course will be more or less modified.

(b.) Formation of Fissures.       During earthquake
movements, fissures may be formed in the crust, and
filled with gaseous or melted matter which may not
in all cases reach the surface; and, on the principle
that volcanoes are safety-valves for regions beyond
their immediate influence, we may infer that the earthquake
shock, which generally precedes the outburst of
[Pg 219]a volcano long dormant, finds relief by the eruption
which follows; so that whatever may be the extent of
the disastrous results of such an eruption, they would
be still more disastrous if there had been no such
safety-valve as that afforded by a volcanic vent. Thus,
probably, owing to the extinction of volcanic activity
in Syria, the earthquakes in that region have been
peculiarly destructive. For example, on January 1,
1837, the town of Safed west of the Jordan valley was
completely destroyed by an earthquake in which most
of the inhabitants perished. The great earthquakes
of Aleppo in the present century, and of Syria in the
middle of the eighteenth, were of exceptional severity.
In that of Syria, which took place in 1759, and which
was protracted during a period of three months, an
area of 10,000 square leagues was affected. Accon,
Saphat, Baalbeck, Damascus, Sidon, Tripoli, and other
places were almost entirely levelled to the ground;
many thousands of human beings lost their lives.[4]
Other examples might be cited.

(c.) Earthquake Waves.       We have now to return to
the phenomena connected with the transmission of
earthquake-waves. The velocity of transmission
through the earth is very great, and several attempts
have been made to measure this velocity with accuracy.
The most valuable of such attempts are those connected
with the Charleston and Riviera shocks. Fortunately,
owing to the perfection of modern appliances, and the
number of observers all over the globe, these results
are entitled to great confidence. The phenomena
connected with the Charleston earthquake, which took
[Pg 220]place on the 31st of August, 1886, are described in
great detail by Captain Clarence E. Dutton, of the
U.S. Ordnance Corps.[5] The conclusions arrived at
are;       that as regards the depth of the focal point, this is
estimated at twelve miles, with a probable error of less
than two miles; while, as regards the rate of travel of
the earthquake-wave, the estimate is (in one case)
about 3.236 miles per second; and in another about
3.226 miles per second.

On the other hand, in the case of the earthquake of
the Riviera, which took place on the 23rd of February,
1887, at 5.30 a.m. (local time), the vibrations of which
appear to have extended across the Atlantic, and to
have sensibly affected the seismograph in the Government
Signal Office at Washington, the rate of travel
was calculated at about 500 miles per hour, less than
one-half that determined in the case of Charleston;
but Captain Dutton claims, and probably with justice,
that the results obtained in the latter case are far
more reliable than any hitherto arrived at.

(d.) Oceanic Waves.       When the originating impact
takes place under the bed of the ocean       either by a
sudden up-thrust of the crust to the extent, let us
suppose, of two or three feet, or by an explosion from
a submarine volcano       a double wave is formed, one
travelling through the crust, the other through the
ocean; and as the rate of velocity of the former is
greatly in excess of that of the latter, the results on
their reaching the land are often disastrous in the
extreme. It is the ocean-wave, however, which is the
more important, and calls for special consideration. If
the impact takes place in very deep water, the whole
mass of the water is raised in the form of a low dome,
[Pg 221]sloping equally away in all directions; and it commences
to travel outwards as a wave with an advancing
crest until it approaches the coast and enters
shallow water. The wave then increases in height,
and the water in front is drawn in and relatively
lowered; so that on reaching a coast with a shelving
shore the form of the surface consists of a trough in
front followed by an advancing crest. These effects
may be observed on a small scale in the case of a
steamship advancing up a river, or into a harbour
with a narrow channel, but are inappreciable in deep
water, or along a precipitous open coast.

(e.) The Earthquake of Lisbon, 1755.       The disastrous
results of a submarine earthquake upon the
coast have never been more terribly illustrated than
in the case of the earthquake of Lisbon which took
place on November 1, 1755. The inhabitants had no
warning of the coming danger, when a sound like
that of thunder was heard underground, and immediately
afterwards a violent shock threw down the
greater part of their city; this was the land-wave. In the
course of about six minutes, sixty thousand persons
perished. The sea first retired and left the harbour dry,
so forming the trough in front of the crest; immediately
after the water rolled in with a lofty crest, some 50
feet above the ordinary level, flooding the harbour and
portions of the city bordering the shore. The mountains
of Arrabida, Estrella, Julio, Marvan, and Cintra,
were impetuously shaken, as it were, from their very
foundations; and according to the computation of
Humboldt, a portion of the earth's surface four times
the extent of Europe felt the effects of this great
seismic shock, which extended to the Alps, the shores
of the Baltic, the lakes of Scotland, the great lakes of
[Pg 222]North America, and the West Indian Islands. The
velocity of the sea-wave was estimated at about 20
miles per minute.

(f.) Earthquake of Lima and Callao, 28th October,
1746.       Of somewhat similar character was the terrible
catastrophe with which the cities of Lima and Callao
were visited in the middle of the last century,[6] in
which the former city, then one of great magnificence,
was overthrown; and Callao was inundated by
a sea-wave, in which out of 23 ships of all sizes in the
harbour the greater number foundered; several, including
a man-of-war, were lifted bodily and stranded,
and all the inhabitants with the exception of about
two hundred were drowned. A volcano in Lucanas
burst forth the same night, and such quantities of
water descended from the cone that the whole
country was overflowed; and in the mountain near
Pataz, called Conversiones de Caxamarquilla, three
other volcanoes burst forth, and torrents of water
swept down their sides. In the case of these cities,
the land-wave, or shock, preceded the sea-wave, which
of course only reached the port of Callao.

intensity, the force decreasing outwards from the focus at Charleston,

(g.) Earthquake of Charleston, 31st August, 1886.       I
shall close this account of some remarkable earthquakes
with a few facts regarding that of Charleston,
on the Atlantic seaboard of Carolina.[7] At 9.51 a.m.
of this day, the inhabitants engaged in their ordinary
occupations were startled by the sound of a distant
roar, which speedily deepened in volume so as to resemble
the noise of cannon rattling along the road,
"spreading into an awful noise, that seemed to pervade
at once the troubled earth below and the still air
above." At the same time the floors began to heave
underfoot, the walls visibly swayed to and fro, and the
crash of falling masonry was heard on all sides, while
[Pg 224]universal terror took possession of the populace, who
rushed into the streets, the black portion of the community
being the most demonstrative of their terror.
Such was the commencement of the earthquake, by
which nearly all the houses of Charleston were damaged
or destroyed, many of the public buildings seriously
injured or partially demolished. The effects were felt
all over the States as far as the great lakes of Canada
and the borders of the Rocky Mountains. Two
epicentral foci appear to have been established; one
lying about 15 miles to the N.W. of Charleston, called
the Woodstock focus; the other about 14 miles due
west of Charleston, called the Rantowles focus;
around each of these foci the isoseismic curves concentrated,[8]
but in the map (Fig. 37) are combined
into the area of one curve. The position of these foci
clearly shows that the origin of the Charleston earthquake
was not submarine, though occurring within a
short distance of the Atlantic border; the curves of
equal intensity (isoseismals) are drawn all over the
area influenced by the shock.

As a general result of these detailed observations,
Captain Dutton states that there is a remarkable
coincidence in the phenomena with those indicated by
the theory of wave-motion as the proper one for an
elastic, nearly homogeneous, solid medium, composed
of such materials as we know to constitute the rocks
of the outer portions of the earth; but on the other
hand he states that nothing has been disclosed which
seems to bring us any nearer to the precise nature of
the forces which generated the disturbance.[9]

[1] The views of Mr. R. Mallet, briefly stated, are somewhat as
follows:       Owing to the secular cooling of the earth, and the consequent
lateral crushing of the surface, this crushing from time to
time overcomes the resistance; in which case shocks are experienced
along the lines of fracture and faulting by which the crust is intersected.
These shocks give rise to earthquake waves, and as the crushing of the
walls of the fissure developes heat, we have here the vera causa both of
volcanic eruptions and earthquake shocks       the former intensified into
explosions by access of water through the fissures.       "On the Dynamics

PART VII.

VOLCANIC AND SEISMIC PROBLEMS.




CHAPTER I.

THE ULTIMATE CAUSE OF VOLCANIC ACTION.


Volcanic phenomena are the outward manifestations
of forces deep-seated beneath the crust of the
globe; and in seeking for the causes of such phenomena
we must be guided by observation of their
nature and mode of action. The universality of these
phenomena all over the surface of our globe, in past
or present times, indicates the existence of a general
cause beneath the crust. It is true that there are
to be found large tracts from which volcanic rocks
(except those of great geological antiquity) are
absent, such as Central Russia, the Nubian Desert,
and the Central States of North America; but such
absence by no means implies the non-existence of
the forces which give rise to volcanic action beneath
those regions, but only that the forces have not been
sufficiently powerful to overcome the resistance offered
by the crust over those particular tracts. On the
other hand, the similarity of volcanic lavas over wide
regions is strong evidence that they are drawn from
[Pg 226]one continuous magma, consisting of molten matter
beneath the solid exterior crust.

(a.) Lines of Volcanic Action.       It has been shown in a
previous page that volcanic action of recent or Tertiary
times has taken place mainly along certain lines which
may be traced on the surface of a map or globe. One
of these lines girdles the whole globe, while others lie
in certain directions more or less coincident with lines
of flexure, plication or faulting. The Isle of Sumatra
offers a remarkable example of the coincidence of
such lines with those of volcanic vents. Not only the
great volcanic cones, but also the smaller ones, are
disposed in chains which run parallel to the longitudinal
axis of the island (N.W.-S.E.). The sedimentary
rocks are bent and faulted in lines parallel
to the main axis, and also to the chains of volcanic
mountains, and the observation holds good with
regard to different geological periods.[1] Another
remarkable case is that of the Jordan Valley. Nowhere
can the existence of a great fracture and
vertical displacement of the strata be more clearly
determined than along this remarkable line of depression;
and it is one which is also coincident with a
zone of earthquake and volcanic disturbances.

(b.) Such Lines generally lie along the Borders of the
Ocean.       But even where, from some special cause,
actual observation on the relations of the strata are
precluded, the general configuration of the ground
and the relations of the boundaries between land and
sea to those of volcanic chains, evidently point in
many cases to their mutual interdependence. The
remarkable straightness of the coast of Western
[Pg 227]America, and of the parallel chain of the Andes,
affords presumptive evidence that this line is coincident
with a fracture or system of faults, along which
the continent has been bodily raised out of the waters
of the ocean. Of this elevation within very recent times
we have abundant evidence in the existence of raised
coral-reefs and oceanic shell-beds at intervals all along
the coast; rising in Peru to a level of no less than
3,000 feet above the ocean, as shown by Alexander
Agassiz.[2] Such elevations probably occurred at a
time when the volcanoes of the Andes were much
more active than at present. Considered as a whole,
these great volcanic mountains may be regarded as
in a dormant, or partially moribund, condition; and
if the volcanic forces have to some extent lost their
strength, so it would appear have those of elevation.

(c.) Areas of Volcanic Action in the British Isles.       In
the case of the British Islands it may be observed
that the later Tertiary volcanic districts lie along
very ancient depressions, which may indicate zones
of weakness in the crust. Thus the Antrim plateau,
as originally constituted, lay in the lap of a range of
hills formed of crystalline, or Lower Silurian, rocks;
while the volcanic isles of the Inner Hebrides were
enclosed between the solid range of the Archæan
rocks of the Outer Hebrides on the one side, and the
Silurian and Archæan ranges of the mainland on
the other. And if we go back to the Carboniferous
period, we find that the volcanic district of the centre
of Scotland was bounded by ranges of solid strata
both to the north and south, where the resistance to
interior pressure from molten matter would have
been greater than in the Carboniferous hollow-ground,
[Pg 228]where such molten matter has been abundantly extruded.
In all these cases, the outflow of molten
matter was in a direction somewhat parallel to the
plications of the strata.

(d.) Special Conditions under which the Volcanic
Action operates.       Assuming, then, that the molten
matter, forming an interior magma or shell, is constantly
exerting pressure against the inner surface of
the solid crust, and can only escape where the crust
is too weak (owing to faults, plications, or fissures) to
resist the pressure, we have to inquire what are the
special conditions under which outbursts of volcanic
matter take place, and what are the general results
as regards the nature of the ejecta dependent on
those conditions.

(e.) Effect of the Presence or Absence of Water.       The
two chief conditions determining the nature of
volcanic products, considered in the mass, are the
presence or absence of water. Such presence or
absence does not of course affect the essential
chemical composition of the ejecta, but it materially
influences the form in which the matter is erupted.
The agency of water in volcanic eruptions is a very
interesting and important subject in connection with
the history of volcanic action, and has been ably
treated by Professor Prestwich.[3] At one time it was
considered that water was essential to volcanic
activity; and the fact that the great majority of
volcanic cones are situated in the vicinity of the
oceanic waters, or of inland seas, was pointed to in
confirmation of this theory. But the existence in
Western America and other volcanic countries of
fissures of eruption along which molten lava has been
[Pg 229]extruded without explosions of steam, shows that
water is not an essential factor in the production of
volcanic phenomena; and, as Professor Prestwich has
clearly demonstrated, it is to be regarded as an element
in volcanic explosions, rather than as a prime cause
of volcanic action. The main difficulty he shows to
be thermo-dynamical; and calculating the rate of
increase in the elastic force of steam on descending
to greater and greater depths and reaching strata
of higher and higher temperatures, as compared with
the force of capillarity, he comes to the conclusion
that water cannot penetrate to depths of more than
seven or eight miles, and therefore cannot reach the
seat of the eruptive forces. Professor Prestwich also
points out that if the extrusion of lava were due to
the elastic force of vapour of water there should be a
distinct relation between the discharge of the lava
and of the vapour; whereas the result of an examination
of a number of well-recorded eruptions shows that
the two operations are not related, and are, in fact,
perfectly independent. Sometimes there has been a
large discharge of lava, and little or no escape of
steam; at other times there have been paroxysmal
explosive eruptions with little discharge of lava.
Even in the case of Vesuvius, which is close to the sea,
there have been instances when the lava has welled
out almost with the tranquillity of a water-spring.

(f.) Access of Surface Water to Molten Lava during
Eruptions.       The existence of water during certain
stages in eruptions is too frequent a phenomena to
be lost sight of; but its presence may be accounted
for in other ways, besides proximity to the sea or
ocean. Certain volcanic mountains, such as Etna
and Vesuvius, are built upon water-bearing strata,
[Pg 230]receiving their supplies from the rainfall of the surrounding
country, or perhaps partly from the sea.
In addition to this the ashes and scoriæ of the
mountain sides are highly porous, and rain or snow
can penetrate and settle downwards around the pipe
or throat through which molten lava wells up from
beneath. In such cases it is easy to understand how,
at the commencement of a period of activity, molten
lava ascending through one or more fissures, and
meeting with water-charged strata or scoriæ, will convert
the water into steam at high pressure, resulting
in explosions more or less violent and prolonged, in
proportion to the quantity of water and the depth
to which it has penetrated. In this manner we may
suppose that ashes, scoriæ, and blocks of rock torn
from the sides of the crater-throat, and hurled into
the air, are piled around the vent, and accumulate into
hills or mountains of conical form. After the explosion
has exhausted itself, the molten lava quietly
wells up and fills the crater, as in the cases of those of
Auvergne and Syria, and other places. We may,
therefore, adopt the general principle that in volcanic
eruptions where water in large quantities is present, we
shall have crater-cones built up of ashes, scoriæ, and
pumice; but where absent, the lava will be extravasated
in sheets to greater or less distances without the formation
of such cones; or if cones are fanned, they will
be composed of solidified lava only, easily distinguishable
from crater-cones of the first class.

(g.) Nature of the Interior Reservoir from which
Lavas are derived.       We have now to consider the
nature of the interior reservoir from which lavas are
derived, and the physical conditions necessary for
their eruption at the surface.

[Pg 231]Without going back to the question of the original
condition of our globe, we may safely hold the view
that at a very early period of geological history it
consisted of a solidified crust at a high temperature,
enfolding a globe of molten matter at a still higher
temperature. As time went on, and the heat
radiated into space from the surface of the globe,
while at the same time slowly ascending from the
interior by conduction, the crust necessarily contracted,
and pressing more and more on the interior
molten magma, this latter was forced from time to
time to break through the contracting crust along
zones of weakness or fissures.

(h.) The Earth's Crust in a State of both Exterior
Thrust and of Interior Tension.       As has been shown
by Hopkins,[4] and more recently by Mr. Davison,[5] an
exterior crust in such a condition must eventually
result in being under a state of horizontal thrust
towards the exterior and of tension towards the
interior surface. For the exterior portion, having
cooled down, and consequently contracted to its
normal state, will remain rigid up to a certain point
of resistance; but the interior portion still continuing
to contract, owing to the conduction of the heat
towards the exterior, would tend to enter upon a
condition of tension, as becoming too small for the interior
molten magma; and such a state of tension would
tend to produce rupture of the interior part. In this
manner fissures would be formed into which the
molten matter would enter; and if the fissures happened
to extend to the surface, owing to weakness of
the crust or flexuring of the strata, or other cause, the
[Pg 232]molten matter would be extruded either in the form
of dykes or volcanic vents. In this way we may
account for the numerous dykes of trap by which
some volcanic districts are intersected, such as those
of the north of Ireland and centre of Scotland.

From the above considerations, it follows that the
earth's crust must be in a condition both of pressure
(or lateral thrust) towards the exterior portion, and
of tension towards the interior, the former condition
resulting in faulting and flexuring of the rocks, the
latter in the formation of open fissures, through which
lava can ascend under high pressure. These operations
are of course the attempt of the natural forces
to arrive at a condition of equilibrium, which is never
attained because the processes are never completed;
in other words, radiation and convection of heat are
constantly proceeding, giving rise to new forces of
thrust and tension.

It now remains for us to consider what may be the
condition of the interior molten magma; and in doing
so we must be guided to a large extent by considerations
regarding the nature of the extruded matter at
the surface.

(i.) Relative Densities of Lavas.       Now, observation
shows that, as bearing on the subject under consideration,
lavas occur mainly under two classes as regards
their density. The most dense (or basic) are those in
which silica is deficient, but iron is abundant; the
least dense (or acid) are those which are rich in silica,
but in which iron occurs in small quantity. This
division corresponds with that proposed by Bunsen
and Durocher[6] for volcanic rocks, upon the results of
analyses of a large number of specimens from various
districts. Rocks may be thus arranged in groups:
[Pg 233]

(1) The Basic (Heavier)       poor in silica, rich in iron; containing
silica 45-58 per cent. Examples:
Basalt, Dolerite, Hornblende rock, Diorite,
Diabase, Gabbro, Melaphyre, and Leucite
lava.

(2) The Acid (Lighter)       rich in silica, poor in iron; containing
silica 62-78 per cent. Examples:
Trachyte, Rhyolite, Obsidian, Domite, Felsite,
Quartz-porphyry, Granite.

The Andesite group forms a connecting link between
the highly acid and the basic groups, and there are
many varieties of the above which it is not necessary
to enumerate. Durocher supposes that the molten
magmas of these various rocks are arranged in concentric
shells within the solid crust in order of their
respective densities, those of the lighter density,
namely the acid magmas, being outside those of
greater density, namely the basic; and this is a view
which seems not improbable from a consideration not
only of the principle itself, but of the succession of
the varieties of lava in many districts. Thus we find
that acid lavas have been generally extruded first, and
basic afterwards       as in the cases of Western America,
of Antrim, the Rhine and Central France. And
if the interior of our globe had been in a condition
of equilibrium from the time of the consolidation
of the crust to the present, reason would
induce us to conclude that the lavas would ultimately
have arranged themselves in accordance with the
conditions of density beneath that crust. But the
state of equilibrium has been constantly disturbed.
Every fresh outburst of volcanic force, and every fresh
extrusion of lava, tends to disturb it, and to alter the
relations of the interior viscous or molten magmas.
Owing to this it happens, as we may suppose, that the
[Pg 234]order of eruption according to density is sometimes
broken, and we find such rocks as granophyre (a
variety of andesite) breaking through the plateau-basalts
of Mull and Skye, as explained in a former
chapter. Notwithstanding such variations, however,
the view of Durocher may be considered as the most
reasonable we can arrive at on a subject which is
confessedly highly conjectural.

(j.) Conclusion as regards the Ultimate Cause of
Volcanic Action.       Notwithstanding, however, the complexity
of the subject, and the uncertainties which
must attend an inquiry where some of the data are outside
the range of our observation, sufficient evidence
can be adduced to enable us to arrive at a tolerably
clear view of the ultimate cause of volcanic action.
So tempting a subject was sure to evoke numerous
essays, some of great ingenuity, such as that of Mr.
Mallet; others of great complexity, such as that of
Dr. Daubeny. But more recent consideration and
wider observation have tended to lead us to the conclusion
that the ultimate cause is the most simple, the
most powerful, and the most general which can be
suggested; namely, the contraction of the crust due to
secular cooling of the more deeply seated parts by conduction
and radiation of heat into space. Owing to
this cause, the enclosed molten matter is more or less
abundantly extruded from time to time along the
lines and vents of eruption, so as to accommodate itself
to the ever-contracting crust. Nor can we doubt that
this process has been going on from the very earliest
period of the earth's history, and formerly at a greater
rate than at present. When the crust was more
highly heated, the radiation and conduction must
have been proportionately more rapid. Owing to
[Pg 235]this cause also the contraction of the crust was
accelerated. To such irresistible force we owe
the wonderful flexuring, folding, and horizontal
overthrusting which the rocks have undergone in
some portions of the globe       such as in the Alps, the
Highlands of Scotland and of Ireland, and the Alleghannies
of America. It is easy to show that the
acceleration of the earth's rotation must be a consequence
of such contraction; but, after all, this is but
one of those compensatory forces of which we see
several examples in the world around us. It can also
be confidently inferred that at an early period of the
earth's history, when the moon was nearer to our
planet than at present, the tides were far more powerful,
and their effect in retarding the earth's rotation
was consequently greater. During this period the
acceleration due to contraction was also greater; and
the two forces probably very nearly balanced each
other. Both these forces (those of acceleration and
retardation) have been growing weaker down to the
present day, though there appears to have been a
slight advantage on the side of the retarding force.[7]

CHAPTER II.

LUNAR VOLCANOES.


The surface of the moon presented to our view affords
such remarkable indications of volcanic phenomena
of a special kind, that we are justified in devoting a
chapter to their consideration. It is very tantalising
that our beautiful satellite only permits us to look at
and admire one half of her sphere; but it is not a very
far-fetched inference if we feel satisfied that the other
half bears a general resemblance to that which is presented
to the earth. It is scarcely necessary to inform
the reader why it is that we never see but one face;
still, for the sake of those who have not thought out
the subject I may state that it is because the moon
rotates on her axis exactly in the time that she performs
a revolution round the earth. If this should
not be sufficiently clear, let the reader perform a very
simple experiment for himself, which will probably
bring conviction to his mind that the explanation here
given is correct. Let him place an orange in the
centre of a round table, and then let him move
round the table from a starting-point sideways, ever
keeping his face directed towards the orange; and
when he has reached his starting-point, he will find
that he has rotated once round while he has performed
one revolution round the table. In this case the performer
[Pg 237]represents the moon and the orange the
earth.

Now this connection between the earth and her
satellite is sufficiently close to be used as an argument
(if not as actual demonstration) that the earth and
the moon were originally portions of the same mass,
and that during some very early stage in the development
of the solar system these bodies parted company,
to assume for ever after the relations of planet and
satellite. At the epoch referred to, we may also suppose
that these two masses of matter were in a highly
incandescent, if not even gaseous, state; and we conclude,
therefore, that having been once portions of the
same mass, they are composed of similar materials.
This conclusion is of great importance in enabling us
to reason from analogy regarding the origin of the
physical features on the moon's surface, and for the
purpose of comparison with those which we find on
the surface of our globe; because it is evident that, if
the composition of the moon were essentially different
from that of our earth, we should have no basis whatever
for a comparison of their physical features.

When the moon started on her career of revolution
round the earth, we may well suppose that her orbit was
much smaller than at present. She was influenced by
counteracting forces, those of gravitation drawing her
towards the centre of gravity of the earth,[1] and the
centrifugal force, which in the first instance was the
stronger, so that her orbit for a lengthened period
gradually increased until the two forces, those of
[Pg 238]attraction and repulsion, came into a condition of
equilibrium, and she now performs her revolution
round the earth at a mean distance of 240,000 miles,
in an orbit which is only very slightly elliptical.[2] How
the period of the moon's rotation is regulated by the
earth's attraction on her molten lava-sheets, first at the
surface, and now probably below the outer crust, has
been graphically shown by Sir Robert Ball,[3] but it
cannot be doubted that once the moon was appreciably
nearer to our globe than at present. The attraction of
her mass produced tides in the ocean of correspondingly
greater magnitude, and capable of effecting
results, both in eroding the surface and in transporting
masses of rock, far beyond the bounds of our
every-day experience.

Of all the heavenly bodies, the sun excepted, the
moon is the most impressive and beautiful. As we
catch her form, rising as a fair crescent in the western
sky after sunset, gradually increasing in size and
brilliancy night after night till from her circular disk
she throws a full flood of light on our world and then
passes through her decreasing phases, we recognise
her as "the Governor of the night," or in the words
of our own poet, when in her crescent phase, "the
Diadem of night." Seen through a good binocular glass,
her form gains in rotundity; but under an ordinary
telescope with a four-inch objective, she appears like a
globe of molten gold. Yet all this light is derivative,
and is only a small portion of that she receives from
the sun. That her surface is a mass of rigid matter
destitute of any inherent brilliancy, appears plain
[Pg 239]enough when we view a portion of her disk through
a very large telescope. It was the good fortune of
the author to have an opportunity for such a view
through one of the largest telescopes in the world.
The 27-inch refractor manufactured by Sir Howard
Grubb of Dublin, for the Vienna observatory, a few
years ago, was turned on a portion of the moon's
disk before being finally sent off to its destination;
and seen by the aid of such enormous magnifying
power, nothing could be more disappointing as regards
the appearance of our satellite. The sheen and lustre
of the surface was now observed no longer; the mountains
and valleys, the circular ridges and hollows
were, indeed, wonderfully defined and magnified, but
the matter of which they seemed to be constituted
resembled nothing so much as the pale plaster of a
model. One could thus fully realise the fact that the
moon's light is only derivative. Still we must recollect
that the most powerful telescope can only bring
the surface of the moon to a distance from us of
about 250 miles; and it need not be said that objects
seen at such a distance on our earth present very
deceptive appearances; so that we gain little information
regarding the composition of the moon's crust,
or exterior surface, simply from observation by the aid
of large telescopes.

Reasoning from analogy with our globe, we may
infer that the exterior shell of the moon consists of
crystalline volcanic matter of the highly silicated, or
acid, varieties resting upon another of a denser description,
rich in iron, and resembling basalt. This
hypothesis is hazarded on the supposition that the
composition of the matter of the moon's mass resembles
in the main that of our globe. During the
[Pg 240]process of cooling from a molten condition, the heavier
lavas would tend to fall inwards, and allow the lighter
to come to the surface, and form the outer shell in
both cases. Thus, the outer crust would resemble the
trachytic lavas of our globe, and their pale colour
would enable the sun's rays to be reflected to a greater
extent than if the material were of the blackness of
basalt.[4] So much for the material. We have now to
consider the structure of the moon's surface, and here
we find ourselves treading on less speculative and
safer ground. All astronomers since the time of
Schroter seem to be of accord in the opinion that the
remarkable features of the moon's surface are in some
measure of volcanic origin, and we shall presently
proceed to consider the character of these forms more
in detail.

But first, and as leading up to the discussion of
these physical features, we must notice one essential
difference between the constitution of the moon and
of the earth; namely, the absence of water and of an
atmosphere in the case of the moon. The sudden and
complete occultation of the stars when the moon's disk
passes between them and the place of the observer on
the earth's surface, is sufficient evidence of the absence
of air; and, as no cloud has ever been noticed to veil
even for a moment any part of our satellite's face, we
are pretty safe in concluding that there is no water;
or at least, if there be any, that it is inappreciable in
[Pg 241]quantity.[5] Hence we infer that there is no animal or
vegetable life on the moon's surface; neither are there
oceans, lakes or rivers, snowfields or glaciers, river-valleys
or cañons, islands, stratified rocks, nor volcanoes
of the kind most prevalent on our own
globe.




  



Fig. 38.       Photograph of the moon's surface (in part) showing the
illuminated "spots," and ridges, and the deep hollows. The position
of "Tycho" is shown near the upper edge, and some of the volcanic
craters are very clearly seen near the margin.




[Pg 242]Now on looking at a photographic picture of the
moon's surface (Fig. 38), we observe that there are
enormous dark spaces, irregular in outline, but more or
less approaching the circular form, surrounded by steep
and precipitous declivities, but with sides sloping outwards.
These were supposed at one time to be seas;
and they retain the name, though it is universally
admitted that they contain no water. Some of these
hollows are four English miles in depth. The largest
of these, situated near the north pole of the moon, is
called Mare Imbrium; next to it is Mare Serenitatis;
next, Mare Tranquilitatis, with several others.[6] Mare
Imbrium is of great depth, and from its floor rise
several conical mountains with circular craters, the
largest of which, Archimedes, is fifty miles in diameter;
its vast smooth interior being divided into seven
distinct zones running east and west. There is no
central mountain or other obvious internal sign of
former volcanic activity, but its irregular wall rises
into abrupt towers, and is marked outside by decided
terraces.[7]

The Mare Imbrium is bounded along the east by a
range of mountains called the Apennines, and towards
the north by another range called the Alps; while a
third range, that of the Caucasus, strikes northward
from the junction of the two former ranges. Several
[Pg 243]circular or oval craters are situated on, and near to,
the crest of these ridges.



  



Fig. 39.       A magnified portion of the moon's surface, showing the
forms of the great craters with their outer ramparts. The white spot
with shadow is a cone rising from the centre of one of the larger craters
to a great height and thus becoming illuminated by the sun's light.




But the greater part of the moon's hemisphere is
dotted over by almost innumerable circular crater-like
hollows; sometimes conspicuously surmounting lofty
conical mountains, at other times only sinking below
the general outer surface of the lunar sphere. On
approaching the margin, these circular hollows appear
oval in shape owing to their position on the sphere;
and the general aspect of those that are visible leads
to the conclusion that there are large numbers of
smaller craters too small to be seen by the most
powerful telescopes. These cones and craters are
[Pg 244]the most characteristic objects on the whole of the
visible surface, and when highly magnified present
very rugged outlines, suggestive of slag, or lava,
which has consolidated on cooling, as in the case of
most solidified lava-streams on our earth.[8] One of
the most remarkable of these crateriform mountains
is that named Copernicus, situated in a line with the
southern prolongation of the Apennines. Of this
mountain Sir R. Ball says: "It is particularly well
known through Sir John Herschel's drawing, so
beautifully reproduced in the many editions of the
Outlines of Astronomy. The region to the west is
dotted over with innumerable minute craterlets. It
has a central, many-peaked mountain about 2,400
feet in height. There is good reason to believe that
the terracing shown in its interior is mainly due to
the repeated alternate rise, partial congealation and
retreat of a vast sea of lava. At full moon it is
surrounded by radiating streaks."[9] The view regarding
the structure of Copernicus here expressed is of
importance, as it is probably applicable to all the
craters of our satellite.

"When the moon is five or six days old," says Sir
Robert Ball, "a beautiful group of three craters will
be readily found on the boundary line between night
and day. These are Catharina, Cyrillus, and Theophilus.
Catharina is the most southerly of the group,
and is more than 16,000 feet deep and connected to
Cyrillus by a wide valley; but between Cyrillus and
Theophilus there is no such connection. Indeed
Cyrillus looks as if its huge surrounding ramparts,
as high as Mont Blanc, had been completely finished
[Pg 245]when the volcanic forces commenced the formation of
Theophilus, the rampart of which encroaches considerably
on its older neighbour. Theophilus stands
as a well-defined round crater, about 64 miles in
diameter, with an internal depth of 14,000 to 18,000
feet, and a beautiful central group of mountains, one-third
of that height, on its floor. This proves that the
last eruptive efforts in this part of the moon fully
equalled in intensity those that had preceded them.
Although Theophilus is on the whole the deepest
crater we can see in the moon, it has received little
or no deformation by secondary eruptions."

But perhaps the most remarkable object on the
whole hemisphere of the moon is "the majestic
Tycho," which rises from the surface near the south
pole, and at a distance of about 1/6th of the diameter
of the sphere from its margin. Its depth is stated by
Ball to be 17,000 feet, and its diameter 50 miles.
But its special distinction amongst the other volcanic
craters lies in the streaks of light which radiate from
it in all directions for hundreds and even thousands of
miles, stretching with superb indifference across vast
plains, into the deepest craters, and over the highest
opposing ridges. When the sun rises on Tycho these
streaks are invisible, but as soon as it has reached a
height of 25° to 30° above the horizon, the rays emerge
from their obscurity, and gradually increase in brightness
until full moon, when they become the most conspicuous
objects on her surface. As yet no satisfactory
explanation has been given of the origin of these illuminated
rays,[10] but I may be permitted to add that their
form and mode of occurrence are eminently suggestive
of gaseous exhalations from the volcano illumined by
[Pg 246]the sun's rays; and owing to the absence of an
atmosphere, spreading themselves out in all directions
and becoming more and more attenuated until they
cease to be visible.

The above account will probably suffice to give the
reader a general idea of the features and inferential
structure of the moon's surface. That she was once
a molten mass is inferred from her globular form;
but, according to G. F. Chambers, the most delicate
measurements indicate no compression at the poles.[11]
That her surface has cooled and become rigid is also
a necessary inference; though Sir J. Herschel considered
that the surface still retains a temperature
possibly exceeding that of boiling water.[12] However
this may be, it is pretty certain that whatever changes
may occur upon her surface are not due to present
volcanic action, all evidence of such action being
admittedly absent. If, when the earth and moon
parted company, their respective temperatures were
equal, the moon being so much the smaller of the
two would have cooled more rapidly, and the surface
may have been covered by a rigid crust when as yet
that of the earth may have been molten from heat.
Hence the rigidity of the moon's surface may date
back to an immensely distant period, but she may
still retain a high temperature within this crust.
Having arrived at this stage of our narrative, we are
in a position to consider by what means, and under
what conditions, the cones and craters which diversify
the lunar surface have been developed.

In doing so it may be desirable, in the first place, to
determine what form of crater on our earth's surface
those of the moon do not represent; and we are
[Pg 247]guided in our inquiry by the consideration of the
absence of water on the lunar surface. Now there
are large numbers of crateriform mountains on our
globe in the formation of which water has played an
important, indeed essential, part. As we have already
seen, water, though not the ultimate cause of volcanic
eruptions, has been the chief agent, when in the form
of steam at high pressure, in producing the explosions
which accompany these eruptions, and in tearing up
and hurling into the air the masses of rock, scoriæ,
and ashes, which are piled around the vents of eruption
in the form of craters during periods of activity.
To this class of craters those of Etna, Vesuvius, and
Auvergne belong. These mountains and conical hills
(the domes excepted) are all built up of accumulations
of fragmental material, with occasional sheets
and dykes of lava intervening; and where eruptions
have taken place in recent times, observation has
shown that they are accompanied by outbursts of
vast quantities of aqueous vapour, which has been the
chief agent (along with various gases) in piling up the
circular walls of the crater.

It has also been shown that in many instances
these crater-walls have been breached on one side,
and that streams of molten lava which once occupied
the cup to a greater or less height, have poured down
the mountain side. Hence the form or outline of
many of these fragmental craters is crescent-shaped.
Such breached craters are to be found in all parts of
the world, and are not confined to any one district, or
even continent, so that they may be considered as
characteristic of the class of volcanic crater-cones to
which I am now referring. In the case of the moon,
however, we fail to observe any decided instances
[Pg 248]of breached craters, with lava-streams, such as those
I have described.[13] In nearly all cases the ramparts
appear to extend continuously round the enclosed
depression, solid and unbroken; or at least with no
large gap occupying a very considerable section of the
circumference. (See Fig. 38.) Hence we are led to
suspect that there is some essential distinction between
the craters on the surface of the moon and the greater
number of those on the surface of our earth.

It is scarcely necessary to add that the volcanic
mountains of the moon offer no resemblance whatever
to the dome-shaped volcanic mountains of our
globe. If it were otherwise, the lunar mountains
would appear as simple luminous points rising from a
dark floor, over which they would cast a conical
shadow. But the form of the lunar volcanic mountains
is essentially different; as already observed,
they consist in general of a circular rampart enclosing
a depressed floor, sometimes terraced as in the case of
Copernicus, from which rise one or more conical
mountains, which are in effect the later vents of
eruption.

In our search, therefore, for analogous forms on our
own earth, we must leave out the craters and domes
of the type furnished by the European volcanoes and
their representatives abroad, and have recourse to
others of a different type. Is there then, we may ask,
any type of volcanic mountain on our globe comparable
with those on the moon? In all probability
there is.

If the reader will turn to the description of the
[Pg 249]volcanoes of the Hawaiian group in the Pacific,
especially that of Mauna Loa, as given by Professor
Dana and others, and compare it with that of Copernicus,
he will find that in both cases we have a
circular rampart of solid lava enclosing a vast plain
of the same material from which rise one or more
lava-cones. The interiors in both cases are terraced.
So that, allowing for differences in magnitude, it would
seem that there is no essential distinction between
lunar craters and terrestrial craters of the type of
Mauna Loa. Dana calls these Hawaiian volcanoes
"basaltic," basalt being the prevalent material of
which they are formed. Those of the moon may be
composed of similar material, or otherwise; but in
either case we may suppose they are built up of
lava, erupted from vents connected with the molten
reservoirs of the interior. Thus we conclude that they
belong to an entirely different type, and have been
built up in a different manner, from those represented
by Etna, Vesuvius, and most of the extinct volcanoes
of Auvergne, the Eifel, and of other districts considered
in these pages.

Let us now endeavour to picture to ourselves the
stages through which the moon may be supposed to
have passed from the time her surface began to consolidate
owing to the radiation of her heat into space;
for there is every probability that some of the craters
now visible on her disk were formed at a very early
period of her physical history.

When the surface began to consolidate, it must
also have contracted; and the interior molten matter,
pressed out by the contracting crust, must have been
over and over again extruded through fissures produced
over the solidified surface, until the solid crust
[Pg 250]extended over the whole lunar surface, and became
of considerable thickness.

It is from this epoch that, in all probability, we
should date the commencement of what may be
termed "the volcanic history" of the moon. We
must bear in mind that although the moon's surface
had become solid, its temperature may have remained
high for a very long period. But the continuous
radiation of the surface-heat into space would produce
continuous contraction, while the convection of the
interior heat would tend to increase the thickness of
the outer solid shell; and this, ever pressing with
increasing force on the interior molten mass, would
result in frequent ruptures of the shell, and the extrusion
of molten lava rising from below. Hence we
may suppose the fissure-eruptions of lava were of
frequent occurrence for a lengthened period during
the early stage of consolidation of the lunar crust; but
afterwards these may be supposed to have given place
to eruptions through pipes or vents, resulting in the
formation of the circular craters which form such
striking and characteristic objects in the physical
aspect of our satellite.[14]

It is not to be supposed that the various physical
features on the lunar surface have all originated in
the same way. The great ranges of mountains previously
described may have originated by a process
of piling up of immense masses of molten lava
extruded from the interior through vents or fissures;
while the great hollows (or "seas") are probably
[Pg 251]due to the falling inwards of large spaces owing to
the escape of the interior lava.

But it is with the circular craters that we are most
concerned. Judging from analogy with the lava-craters
present on our globe, we must suppose them
to be due to the extrusion, and piling up, of lava
through central pipes, followed in some cases by
the subsidence of the floor of the crater. It seems
not improbable that it was in this way the greater
number of the circular craters lying around Tycho,
and dotting so large a space round the margin of
the moon, were constructed. (See Fig. 38.) In
general they appear to consist of an elevated rim,
enclosing a depressed plain, out of which a central
cone arises. The rim may be supposed to have been
piled up by successive discharges of lava from a
central orifice; and after the subsidence of the
paroxysm the lava still in a molten condition may
have sunk down, forming a seething lake within the
vast circular rampart, as in the case of the Hawaiian
volcanoes. The terraces observable within the craters
in some instances have probably been left by subsequent
eruptions which have not attained to the level
of preceding ones; and where a central crater-cone is
seen to rise within the caldron, we may suppose this
to have been built up by a later series of eruptions of
lava through the original pipe after the consolidation
of the interior sea of lava. The mamelons of the
Isle of Bourbon,[15] and some of the lava-cones of
Hawaii, appear to offer examples on our earth's
surface of these peculiar forms.

Such are the views of the origin of the physical
[Pg 252]features of our satellite which their form and inferred
constitution appear to suggest. They are not offered
with any intention of dogmatising on a subject
which is admittedly obscure, and regarding which
we have by no means all the necessary data for
coming to a clear conclusion. All that can be
affirmed is, that there is a great deal to be said in
support of them, and that they are to some extent in
harmony with phenomena within range of observation
on the surface of our earth.

The far greater effects of lunar vulcanicity, as compared
with those of our globe, may be accounted for
to some extent by the consideration that the force of
gravity on the surface of the moon is only one-sixth
of that on the surface of the earth. Hence the
eruptive forces of the interior of our satellite have
had less resistance to overcome than in the case of
our planet; and the erupted materials have been shot
forth to greater distances, and piled up in greater
magnitude, than with us. We have also to recollect
that the abrading action of water has been absent
from the moon; so that, while accumulations of matter
had been proceeding throughout a prolonged period
over its surface, there was no counteracting agency
of denudation at work to modify or lessen the effects
of the ruptive forces.

[1] Correctly speaking, each attracts the other towards its centre of
gravity with a force proportionate to its mass, and inversely as the
square of the distance; but the earth being by much the larger body,
its attraction is far greater than that of the moon.

[2] The variation in the distance is only under rare circumstances
40,000 miles, but ordinarily about 13,000 miles.

[3] Story of the Heavens, 2nd edition, p. 525, et seq.

[4] A series of researches made by Zöllner, of Leipzig, led him to
assign to the light-reflecting capacity of the full-moon a result intermediate
between that obtained by Bouguer, which gave a brightness equal
to 1/300000 part of that of the sun, and of Wollaston, which gave 1/801070
part. We may accept 1/618000 of Zöllner as sufficiently close; so that it
would require 600,000 full moons to give the same amount of light as
that of the sun.

[5] Schroter, however, came to the conclusion that the moon has an
atmosphere.

[6] A chart of the moon's surface, with the names of the principal
physical features, will be found in Ball's Story of the Heavens, 2nd
edit., p. 60. It must be remembered that the moon as seen through a
telescope appears in reversed position.

[13] At rare intervals a few crescent-shaped ridges are discernible on the
lunar sphere, but it is very doubtful if they are to be regarded as
breached craters.

[14] The number of "spots" on the moon was considered to be 244
until Schroter increased it to 6,000, and accurately described many of
them. Schroter seems to have been the earliest observer who identified
the circular hollows on the moon's surface as volcanic craters.

CHAPTER III.

ARE WE LIVING IN AN EPOCH OF SPECIAL
VOLCANIC ACTIVITY?


The question which we are about to discuss in the
concluding chapter of this volume is one to which we
ought to be able to offer a definite answer. This
can only be arrived at by a comparison of the violence
and extent of volcanic and seismic phenomena within
the period of history with those of pre-historic periods.

At first sight we might be disposed to give to the
question an affirmative reply when we remember the
eruptions of the last few years, and add to these the
volcanic outbursts and earthquake shocks which
history records. The cases of the earthquake and
eruption in Japan of November, 1891, where in one
province alone two thousand people lost their lives
and many thousand houses were levelled[1]; that of
Krakatoa, in 1883; of Vesuvius, in 1872; and many
others of recent date which might be named, added
to those which history records;       the recollection of
such cases might lead us to conclude that our epoch
is one in which the subterranean volcanic forces had
broken out with extraordinary energy over the earth's
[Pg 254]surface. Still, when we come to examine into the cases
of recorded eruptions       especially those of great violence       we
find that they are limited to very special districts;
and even if we extend our retrospect into the
later centuries of our era, we shall find that the exceptionally
great eruptions have been confined to certain
permanently volcanic regions, such as the chain of
the Andes, that of the Aleutian, Kurile, Japanese, and
Philippine and Sunda Islands, lying for the most part
along the remarkable volcanic girdle of the world to
which I have referred in a previous page. Add to
these the cases of Iceland and the volcanic islands of
the Pacific, and we have almost the whole of the very
active volcanoes of the world.

Then for the purposes of our inquiry we have to
ascertain how these active vents of eruption compare,
as regards the magnitude of their operations,
with those of the pre-historic and later Tertiary
times. But before entering into this question it maybe
observed, in the first place, that a large number of
the vents of eruption, even along the chain of the
earth's volcanic girdle, are dormant or extinct. This
observation applies to many of the great cones and
domes of the Andes, including Chimborazo and other
colossal mountains in Ecuador, Columbia, Chili, Peru,
and Mexico. The region between the eastern Rocky
Mountains and the western coast of North America
was, as we have seen, one over which volcanic eruptions
took place on a vast scale in later Tertiary
times; but one in which only the after-effects of
volcanic action are at present in operation. We have
also seen that the chain of volcanoes of Japan and of
the Kurile Islands are only active to a slight extent
as compared with former times, and the same observation
[Pg 255]applies to those of New Zealand. Out of 130
volcanoes in the Japanese islands, only 48 are now
believed to be active.

Again, if we turn to other districts we have been
considering, we find that in the Indian Peninsula, in
Arabia, in Syria and the Holy Land, in Persia, in
Abyssinia and Asia Minor       regions where volcanic
operations were exhibited on a grand scale throughout
the Tertiary period, and in some cases almost
down into recent times       we are met by similar evidences
either of decaying volcanic energy, or of an
energy which, as far as surface phenomena are concerned,
is a thing of the past. Lastly, turning our
attention to the European area, notwithstanding the
still active condition of Etna, Vesuvius, and a few
adjoining islands, we see in all directions throughout
Southern Italy evidences of volcanic operations of a
past time,       such as extinct crater-cones, lakes occupying
the craters of former volcanoes, and extensive
deposits of tuff or streams of lava       all concurring in
giving evidence of a period now past, when vulcanicity
was widespread over regions where its presence is
now never felt except when some earthquake shock,
like that of the Riviera, brings home to our minds the
fact that the motive force is still beneath our feet,
though under restrained conditions as compared with
a former period.

Similar conclusions are applicable with even greater
force to other parts of the European area. The region
of the Lower Rhine and Moselle, of Hungary and the
Carpathians, of Central France, of the North of Ireland
and the Inner Hebrides, all afford evidence of
volcanic operations at a former period on an extensive
scale; and the contrast between the present physically
[Pg 256]silent and peaceful condition of these regions, as
regards any outward manifestations of sub-terrestrial
forces, compared with those which were formerly
prevalent, cannot fail to impress our minds irresistibly
with the idea that volcanic energy has well-nigh exhausted
itself over these tracts of the earth's surface.

From this general survey of the present condition
of the earth's surface, as regards the volcanic operations
going on over it, and a comparison with those
of a preceding period, we are driven to the conclusion
that, however violent and often disastrous are the
volcanic and seismic phenomena of the present day,
they are restricted to comparatively narrow limits;
and that even within these limits the volcanic forces
are less powerful than they were in pre-historic times.

The middle part of the Tertiary period appears,
in fact, to have been one of extraordinary volcanic
activity, whether we regard the wide area over which
this activity manifested itself, or the results as shown
by the great amount of the erupted materials. Many
of the still active volcanic chains, or groups, probably
had their first beginnings at the period referred to;
but in the majority of cases the eruptive forces have
become dormant or extinct. With the exception of
the lavas of the Indian-Peninsular area, which appear,
at least partially, to belong to the close of the Cretaceous
epoch, the specially volcanic period may
be considered to extend from the beginning of the
Miocene down to the close of the Pliocene stage.
During the Eocene stage, volcanic energy appears to
have been to a great degree dormant; but plutonic
energy was gathering strength for the great effort of
the Miocene epoch, when the volcanic forces broke
out with extraordinary violence over Europe, the
[Pg 257]British Isles, and other regions, and continued to
develop throughout the succeeding Pliocene epoch,
until the whole globe was surrounded by a girdle of
fire.



The reply, therefore, to the question with which we
set out is very plain; and is to the effect that the
present epoch is one of comparatively low volcanic
activity. The further question suggests itself, whether
the volcanic phenomena of the middle Tertiary period
bear any comparison with those of past geological
times. This, though a question of great interest, is one
which is far too large to be discussed here; and it is
doubtful if we have materials available upon which to
base a conclusion. But it may be stated with some
confidence, in general terms, that the history of the
earth appears to show that, throughout all geological
time, our world has been the theatre of intermittent
geological activity, periods of rest succeeding those of
action; and if we are to draw a conclusion regarding
the present and future, it would be that, owing to the
lower rate of secular cooling of the crust, volcanic
action ought to become less powerful as the world
grows older.

APPENDIX.

A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE PRINCIPAL VARIETIES
OF VOLCANIC ROCKS.


The text-books on this subject are so numerous and accessible,
that a very brief account of the volcanic rocks is all that need
be given here for the purposes of reference by readers not
familiar with petrological details.

Let it be observed, in the first place, that there is no hard and
fast line between the varieties of igneous and volcanic rocks.
In this as in other parts of creation       natura nil facit per
saltum; there are gradations from one variety to the other.
At the same time a systematic arrangement is not only desirable,
but necessary; and the most important basis of arrangement
is that founded on the proportion of silica (or quartz) in
the various rocks, as first demonstrated by Durocher and
Bunsen, who showed that silica plays the same part in the
inorganic kingdom that carbon does in the organic. Upon this
hypothesis, which is a very useful one to work with, these
authors separated all igneous and volcanic rocks into two
classes, viz., the Basic and the Acid; the former containing
from 45-58 per cent., the latter 62-78 per cent. of that mineral.
But there are a few intermediate varieties which serve to bridge
over the space between the Basic and Acid Groups. The following
is a generalised arrangement of the most important rocks
under the above heads:

10. Rhyolite and Obsidian.

In the above grouping, and in the following definitions, I have
not been able to follow any special authority. But the most serviceable
text-books are those of Mr. Frank Rutley, Study of
Rocks, and Dr. Hatch, Petrology; also H. Rosenbusch, Mikroskopische
Physiographie der Mineralien, and F. Zirkel's Untersuchungen
über mikroskopische Structur der Basaltgesteine. We
shall consider these in the order above indicated:       

1. Basalt.       The most extensively distributed of all volcanic
rocks. It is a dense, dark rock of high specific gravity (2.4-2.8),
consisting of plagioclase felspar (Labradorite or anorthite),
augite, and titano-ferrite (titaniferous magnetite). Olivine is
often present; and when abundant the rock is called "olivine-basalt."
In the older rocks, basalt has often undergone decomposition
into melaphyre; and amongst the metamorphic rocks
it has been changed into diorite or hornblende rock; the augite
having been converted into hornblende.

When leucite or nepheline replaces plagioclase, the rock
becomes a leucite-basalt,[1] or nepheline-basalt. Some basalts
have a glass paste, or "ground-mass," in which the minerals
are enclosed.

The lava of Vesuvius may be regarded as a variety of basalt
in which leucite replaces plagioclase, although this latter mineral
[Pg 261]is also present. Zirkel calls it "Sanidin-leucitgestein," as both
the macroscopic and microscopic structure reveal the presence
of leucite, sanidine, plagioclase, nephiline, augite, mica, olivine,
apatite, and magnetite.[2]

Dolerite does not differ essentially from basalt in composition
or structure, but is a largely crystalline-granular variety,
occurring more abundantly than basalt amongst the more
ancient rocks, and the different minerals are distinctly visible
to the naked eye.

A remarkable variety of this rock occurs at Slieve Gullion in
Ireland, in which mica is so abundant as to constitute the rock
a "micaceous dolerite."

2. Gabbro.       A rather wide group of volcanic rocks with
variable composition. Essentially it is a crystalline-granular
compound of plagioclase, generally Labradorite and diallage.
Sometimes the pyroxenic mineral becomes hypersthene, giving
rise to hypersthene-gabbro; or when hornblende is present, to
hornblende-gabbro; when olivine, to olivine-gabbro. Magnetite
is always present.

These rocks occur in the Carlingford district in Ireland, in
the Lizard district of Cornwall, the Inner Hebrides (Mull,
Skye, etc.) of Scotland, and in Saxony.

3. Diorite.       A crystalline-granular compound of plagioclase
and hornblende with magnetite. When quartz is present it
becomes (according to the usual British acceptation) a syenite;
but this view is gradually giving place to the German definition
of syenite, which is a compound of orthoclase and hornblende;
and it may be better to denominate the variety as quartz-diorite.
The diorites are abundant as sheets and dykes amongst
the older palæozoic and metamorphic rocks, and are sometimes
exceedingly rich in magnetite. Mica, epidote, and chlorite are
also present as accessories.

The rock occurs in North Wales, Charnwood Forest, Wicklow,
Galway, and Donegal, and the Highlands of Scotland.
There can be little doubt that amongst the metamorphic rocks
of Galway, Mayo, and Donegal the great beds of (often columnar)
diorite were originally augitic lavas, which have since undergone
transformation.

[Pg 262]4. Diabase.       It is very doubtful if "Diabase" ought to be
regarded as a distinct species of igneous rock, as it seems to be
simply an altered variety of basalt or dolerite, in which chlorite,
a secondary alteration-product, has been developed by the decomposition
of the pyroxene or olivine of the original rock. It
is a convenient name for use in the field when doubt occurs as
to the real nature of an igneous rock. Melaphyre is a name
given to the very dark varieties of altered augitic lavas, rich in
magnetite and chlorite.

5. Porphyrite (or quartzless porphyry).       A basic variety of
felstone-porphyry, consisting of a felspathic base with distinct
crystals of felspar, with which there may be others of hornblende,
mica, or augite. The colour is generally red or purple,
and it weathers into red clay, in contrast to the highly acid or
silicated felsites which weather into whitish sand.

6. Syenite.       As stated above, this name has been variously
applied. Its derivation is from Syene (Assouan) in Egypt, and
the granitic rocks of that district were called "syenites," under
the supposition (now known to be erroneous) that they differ from
ordinary granites in that they were supposed to be composed of
quartz, felspar, and hornblende, instead of quartz, felspar, and
mica. From this it arose that syenite was regarded as a variety of
granite in which the mica is replaced by hornblende, and this
has generally been the British view of the question. But the
German definition is applied to an entirely different rock,
belonging to the felstone family; and according to this classification
syenite consists of a crystalline-granular compound of
orthoclase and hornblende, in which quartz may or may not be
present. From this it will be seen that, according to Zirkel,
syenite is essentially distinct from diorite in the species of its
felspar.[3] It seems desirable to adopt the German view; and as
regards diorites containing quartz as an accessory, to apply to
them the name of quartz-diorite, as stated above, the name
syenite as used by British geologists having arisen from a
misconception.

7. Mica-trap (Lampophyre).       A rock, allied to the felstone
family, in which mica is an abundant and essential constituent,
thus consisting of plagioclase and mica, with a little magnetite.
Quartz may be an accessory. This rock occurs amongst the
[Pg 263]Lower Silurian strata of Ireland, Cumberland, and the South of
Scotland; it is not volcanic in the ordinary acceptation of that
term. The term lampophyre was introduced by Gümbel in
describing the mica-traps of Fichtelgebirge.

8. Andesite.       This is a dark-coloured, compact or vesicular,
semi-vitreous group of volcanic rocks, composed essentially
of a glassy plagioclase felspar, and a ferro-magnesian
constituent enclosed in a glassy base. According to the nature
of the ferro-magnesian constituent, the group may be divided into
hornblende-andesite, biotite-andesite, and augite-andesite. Quartz
is sometimes present, and when this mineral becomes an essential
it gives rise to a variety called quartz-andesite or dacite.

These rocks are the principal constituents of the lavas of the
Andes, and the name was first applied to them by Leopold von
Buch; but their representatives also occur in the British Isles,
Germany, and elsewhere. Dacite is the lava of Krakatoa and
some of the volcanoes of Japan.

9, 10. Trachyte and Domite, etc.       These names include very
numerous varieties of highly silicated volcanic rock, and in their
general form consist of a white felsitic paste with distinct
crystals of sanidine, together with plagioclase, augite, biotite,
hornblende, and accessories. When crystalline grains or blebs
of quartz occur, we have a quartz-trachyte; when tridymite is
abundant, as in the trachyte of Co. Antrim, we have "tridymite-trachyte."

The trachytes occupy a position between the pitchstone lavas
on the one hand, and the andesites and granophyres on the
other.

(b.) Domite is the name applied to the trachytic rocks of the
Auvergne district and the Puy de Dôme particularly. They do
not contain free quartz, though they are highly acid rocks, containing
sometimes as much as 68 per cent. of silica.

(c.) Phonolite (Clinkstone) is a trachytic rock, composed
essentially of sanidine, nepheline, and augite or hornblende.
It is usually of a greenish colour, hard and compact, so as
to ring under the hammer; hence the name. The Wolf Rock
is composed of phonolite, and it occurs largely in Auvergne.

(d.) Rhyolites are closely connected with the quartz-trachytes,
but present a marked fluidal, spherulitic, or perlitic structure.
They consist of a trachytic ground-mass in which grains or
[Pg 264]crystals of quartz and sanidine, with other accessory minerals,
are imbedded. They occur amongst the volcanic rocks of the
British Isles, Hungary, and the Lipari Islands, from which the
name Liparite has been derived.

(e.) Obsidian (Pitchstone).       This is a vitreous, highly acid
rock, which has become a volcanic glass in consequence of
rapid cooling, distinct minerals not having had time to
form. It has a conchoidal fracture, various shades of colour
from grey to black; and under the microscope is seen to contain
crystallites or microliths, often beautifully arranged in stellate or
feathery groups. Spherulitic structure is not infrequent; and
occasionally a few crystals of sanidine, augite, or hornblende
are to be seen imbedded in the glassy ground-mass. The rock
occurs in dykes and veins in the Western Isles of Scotland, in
Antrim, and on the borders of the Mourne Mountains, near
Newry, in Ireland.

11. Granophyre.       This term, according to Geikie, embraces
the greater portion of the acid volcanic rocks of the
Inner Hebrides. They are closely allied to the quartz-porphyries,
and vary in texture from a fine felsitic or crystalline-granular
quartz-porphyry, in the ground-mass of which
porphyritic turbid felspar and quartz may generally be detected,
to a granitoid rock of medium grain, in which the
component dull felspar and clear quartz can be readily distinguished
by the naked eye. Throughout all the varieties of
texture there is a strong tendency to the development of
minute irregularly-shaped cavities, inside of which quartz or
felspar has crystallised out       a feature characteristic of the
granites of Arran and of the Mourne Mountains.

12. Granite.       A true granite consists of a crystalline-granular
rock consisting of quartz, felspar (orthoclase), and
mica; the quartz is the paste or ground-mass in which the
felspar and mica crystals are enclosed. This is the essential
distinction between a granite and a quartz-porphyry or a granophyre.
Owing to the presence of highly-heated steam under
pressure in the body of the mass when in a molten condition,
the quartz has been the last of the minerals to crystallise out,
and hence does not itself occur with the crystalline form.

True granite is not a volcanic rock, and its representatives
amongst volcanic ejecta are to be found in the granophyres,
[Pg 265]quartz-porphyries, felsites, trachytes, and rhyolites so abundant
in most volcanic countries, and to one or other of these the
so-called granites of the Mourne Mountains, of Arran Island,
and of Skye are to be referred. Granite is a rock which has
been intruded in a molten condition amongst the deep-seated
parts of the crust, and has consolidated under great pressure in
presence of aqueous vapour and with extreme slowness, resulting
in the formation of a rock which is largely crystalline-granular.
Its presence at the surface is due to denudation of the masses
by which it was originally overspread.

Transcriber's Note:


Changed what appeared to be upsilon with inverted breve to upsilon with
perispomeni in the Greek on page 2.

Changed 'Kilarrea' to 'Kilauea' on page 19: Mauna Loa and Kilarrea.

Changed 'Kilanea' to 'Kilauea' on page 39: Kilanea, 4158 feet.

Made punctuation (semi-colons) consistent in caption to figure 16.

Changed 'Brionde' to 'Brioude' on page 94: till at Brionde it becomes.

Changed 'occuping' to 'occupying' on page 96: occuping a hollow.

Changed 'Rodesberg' to 'Roderberg' on page 118: old extinct volcano
of Rodesberg.

Changed 'Wolkenberg' to 'Wolkenburg' on page 118: and that of
the Wolkenberg.

Left the reference to Jeremiah, l. 25. in footnote to Part III Chapter I,
although Jeremiah, li. 25. seems more appropriate.

Changed 'fumarols' to 'fumaroles' on page 137: fumarols give evidence.

Removed extra comma on page 153: of the present, epoch.

Changed 'columnal' to 'columnar' on page 176: the columnal structure.

Left the list numbering as is at the beginning of Chapter II of Part IV,
even though the list begins at item c, as if it continues the list which
began in the previous chapter.

Footnotes were collected at the end of each chapter, and text was flowed
to move illustrations between paragraphs.
This has some effect on the index, since the referred-to text may have
been moved to a different page.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
