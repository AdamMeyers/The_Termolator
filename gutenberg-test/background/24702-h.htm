<h2><a name="Pollyanna" id="Pollyanna"></a>Pollyanna</h2>

<p>The glad play, by Catherine Chisholm Cushing, after the
novel by Eleanor H. Porter. 5 males, 6 females. 2 interiors.
Costumes, modern. Plays 2&frac14; hours. An orphan girl is thrust
into the home of a maiden aunt. In spite of the trials that
beset her, she manages to find something to be glad about, and
brings light into sunless lives. Finally Pollyanna straightens
out the love affairs of her elders, and finds happiness for herself
in Jimmy. "Pollyanna" gives a better appreciation of people
and the world. It reflects the humor and humanity that gave
the story such wonderful popularity among young and old.</p>

<p>Produced in New York, and for two seasons on tour. Royalty,
$25.00. Price, 75 cents.</p>

<h2><a name="Martha_By-the-Day" id="Martha_By-the-Day"></a>Martha By-the-Day</h2>

<p>An optimistic comedy in 3 acts, by Julie M. Lippmann, author
of the "Martha" stories. 5 males. 5 females. 3 interiors. Costumes,
modern. Plays 2&frac12; hours.</p>

<p>Full of quaint humor, old-fashioned, homely sentiment, the
kind that people who see the play will recall and chuckle over
tomorrow and the next day.</p>

<p>Miss Lippmann has herself adapted her successful book for
the stage and has selected from her novel the most telling
incidents, infectious comedy and homely sentiment for the
play, and the result is thoroughly delightful. Royalty, $25.
Price, 60 cents.</p>

<h2><a name="Seventeen" id="Seventeen"></a>Seventeen</h2>

<p>A comedy of youth, in 4 acts, by Booth Tarkington. 8 males,
6 females. 1 exterior. 2 interiors. Costumes, modern. Plays
2&frac12; hours.</p>

<p>It is the tragedy of William Sylvanus Baxter that he has
ceased to be sixteen and is not yet eighteen. Seventeen is not
an age, it is a disease.</p>

<p>In his heart William knows all the tortures and delights of
love. But he is still sent by his mother on errands of the most
humiliating sort and depends on his father for every nickel,
the use of which he must justify before he gets it.</p>

<p>"Silly" Bill fell in love with Lola, the "Baby-Talk Lady,"
a vapid little flirt. To woo her in a manner worthy of himself
(and of her) he steals his father's evening clothes. When his
wooings become a nuisance to the neighborhood, his mother
steals them back, and has them let out to fit the middle-aged
form of her husband, thereby keeping William at home.</p>

<p>But when it comes to the "Baby-Talk Lady's" good-bye
dance, not to be present was unendurable. Now William again
gets the dress suit, and how he wears it at the party, and
Genesis discloses the fact that the proud garment is in reality
his father's makes up the story of the play.</p>

<p>"Seventeen" is a work of exquisite human sympathy and
delicious humor. Royalty, $25.00. Price. 75 cents.</p>

I'm not going to harm you. If you will just keep
quiet. Is that clear to you?</p>

I have is on that dressing table. (<i>Pointing.</i>) Take
it and go.</p>

money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Listen&mdash;&mdash; (<i>Turns back to door.</i>)
They're coming here. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Princess</span>) They mustn't
search this room, do you understand&mdash;you must put
them off&mdash;I'm not what you think I am. (<i>Running
dies away.</i> <span class="smcap">Jarvis</span> <i>turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Princess</span>.) Is there
no way out through that door? (<i>Indicates door</i>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> In the hall opposite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> I thought that red light meant in here.
Hell! I beg your pardon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Well, why don't you go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> I can't go that way. (<i>Indicating door</i>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess</span>. Well, what do you expect me to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis</span>. The light fooled me. I thought that
door led to the fire-escape.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess</span>. You said that before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis</span>. Ha! Ha!</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>Princess.</span> Is the situation so amusing?</p>

you. I blundered in here by mistake. I'm in a tight
fix. I can't leave by that door. I must find some
other. (<i>Sees door 8, across to door 8, and, disgusted,

You're wounded! Those shots I heard&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Please&mdash;I don't see how the devil&mdash;&mdash;
(<i>Runs up and puts up shade at window 3, sees there

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> You have evidently shot someone and
are making me shield you from justice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> (<i>Coming down</i>) No, not from justice&mdash;but
from the law.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> I thought they were the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> No, not always&mdash;there would be no justice
for me at the hands of the law.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Well, that is not for me to decide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> But you shall decide&mdash;at least you shall
listen and if you find me guilty&mdash;I'll&mdash;well, I'll take
that door or, or anything you say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Your presumption is indeed ridiculous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Hardly ridiculous&mdash;I am arguing for my life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Can any decision be more unjust than

<p><span class="smcap"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>Princess.</span> The end? Then why don't you give
yourself up?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> That would not have been the end. You
don't understand, I know, but I'm not flying from
Justice. There was in this a case of shoot or be
shot. (<i>Sound of running toward door 6.</i>) Listen&mdash;they're

<p><span class="smcap">Nita.</span> (<i>Off stage door 5</i>) Madame&mdash;Madame&mdash;(<i>Enters.</i>)

<p><span class="smcap">Nita.</span> (<i>Holding door open</i>) Si&mdash;Se&ntilde;or.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> What is it, Nita?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nita.</span> (<i>Indicating</i> <span class="smcap">Princess</span>) My mistress,
Se&ntilde;or.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">House Detective.</span> (<i>Inside of door&mdash;removing

Forgive me, Madame, but I am so frightened. What
is it? What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Control yourself, Nita. Go to bed,
child. (<span class="smcap">Nita</span> <i>goes to door 5.</i>) I won't need you

<p><span class="smcap"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>Jarvis.</span> (<i>Entering</i> <span class="smcap">L.C.</span>) Thank you. Would
you mind bolting that door again? He might return.
(<span class="smcap">Princess</span> <i>crosses to door and bolts it.</i>) Do
you know what a feud is?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Feud? Spain is the home of feuds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> So is Kentucky. That's where I came
from. You're Spanish?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Then you'll understand&mdash;those shots you
heard, that was the end of a feud. I was called
home suddenly by the death of my father&mdash;shot in
the back&mdash;feud&mdash;man after man&mdash;two families&mdash;the
Marcums and my own had shot each other down.
Then my Dad fell and I was left to fight it out alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Couldn't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Couldn't I? God only knows what I've
been through since. Those two shots you heard&mdash;that
was the finish. This morning when I got back
to my hotel, there was a message waiting for me. It
was signed Jim Marcum, head of the family, and
proposed that, as we were out of Kentucky, we meet
and end the feud amicably. He asked me to meet
him at this hotel in his room&mdash;no matter what hour&mdash;he
would be waiting. He was leaving at six in the
morning and wanted it settled. It was a pretty
scheme. I knew the man and I saw the trap. I
came over here prepared and went directly to his
room. It was on this floor. I flung open the door
and met Jim Marcum face to face. He was waiting.
Without a word he fired. I fired, and he dropped.
Now do you understand why the law would not give
me justice?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Did you kill him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> I don't know&mdash;I didn't wait.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> What are you going to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> I don't know. Do you know what it
means to fight single-handed against fearful odds&mdash;to
fight an endless fight alone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>Princess.</span> Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Endless fight&mdash;without even a single
word of encouragement?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Yes, I know what it means.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> You know? How could you know?
How could any woman know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Yes, I do know, because I too am
fighting against fearful odds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> There is no man to fight for you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> No man left who dares.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> God, if there had only been some woman
to fight for in my fight!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Your mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> She's gone, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Are you alone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> If you're caught it means your life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Suppose I decide to help you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> You have no fear of death? You are
not afraid of ghosts?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> No, I'm not afraid of ghosts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> If you escape from here it will be because
I helped you&mdash;we might say I saved your life,
if what you tell me is true&mdash;and if I do it, it will be
from a selfish motive entirely&mdash;it will be because I
have work for you. Do you understand? Work&mdash;hard
work&mdash;dangerous work. It may mean your
life in the end.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> You are frank, anyway.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> It's a chance&mdash;and you have nothing
to lose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> And if I agree?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> You will begin by taking the ancient
feudal oath of my country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Oath? Isn't my word good enough?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> You will pardon me if I insist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>Jarvis.</span> Very well&mdash;I'll swear the blackest oath
you can utter. Let's hear it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> What's your name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Jarvis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Your full name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Warren Jarvis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Kneel, then, Warren of Jarvis. (<span class="smcap">Jarvis</span>
<i>kneels on both knees.</i>) No, not that way&mdash;on one
knee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> I beg your pardon&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Now repeat this oath: "I, Warren of
Jarvis&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> "I, Warren of Jarvis&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> "Se&ntilde;or of all the domains, fiefs, keeps

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Whew&mdash;&mdash; "Se&ntilde;or of all the domains,
fiefs, keeps and marshes of Warren of Kentucky&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> "Do convey to Maria Theresa, of
Aragon, all my worldly titles and possessions&mdash;&mdash;"
Now take my left hand in both of yours and repeat,
"&mdash;and receive them back as vassal and retainer."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> "And receive them back as vassal and
retainer."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> "And do faithfully fight in my lady's
cause according to the feudal laws of Castile and
Aragon."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> "And do faithfully fight in my lady's
cause according to the feudal laws of Castile and
Aragon."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Arise, vassal. (<span class="smcap">Jarvis</span> <i>arises and
kisses her hand.</i>) That is part of the ceremony, but
I meant to omit it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> I thought that the only sensible part. I
beg your pardon&mdash;but who on earth is this Maria
Theresa that I am hired man to?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> I&mdash;am Her Highness&mdash;Maria Theresa&mdash;Princess
of Aragon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>Jarvis.</span> Good night! You a Princess! And I

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> The trunk&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> The trunk? What about it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> I am sending it on board the Aquitania
at six o'clock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> (<i>Dragging trunk down stage</i>) You
mean to get in it? Good Lord, is it big enough?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> I think so&mdash;and no one could possibly
suspect&mdash;&mdash; (<span class="smcap">Jarvis</span> <i>takes out trays&mdash;locket drops
out&mdash;back to audience.</i>) Oh&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> It's nothing&mdash;I mean it's all right&mdash;it's
just a locket.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Did I break it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess</span>. No&mdash;&mdash; (<span class="smcap">Jarvis</span> <i>takes contents out
of trunk.</i>) I broke it myself on purpose&mdash;yesterday.
It means a great deal to me and perhaps to
you. Some day you may know the reason why.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> (<i>Gets in trunk</i>) Would you mind putting
this lid down? (<span class="smcap">Princess</span> <i>puts down lid of

lid and stands up in trunk.</i> <span class="smcap">Princess</span> <i>raises lid all

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> But it's a chance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> You're <i>right</i>! I'll <i>take</i> it. (<i>Gets out of
trunk and goes to trays.</i>) What are we going to do
with these?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> We had better send those by messenger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> (<i>Turning</i>) Hold on&mdash;I've got it. No,
you had better 'phone. (<span class="smcap">Princess</span> <i>crosses to 'phone</i>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> 417? Hello&mdash;&mdash; Connect me with
the Hotel Belmont, please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Remember, ask for room 417.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Yes, I know. Hello, hello! Is this
the Belmont?&mdash;Give me room 417.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Ask if it's Rusty and be sure and say
"Warren."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Hello&mdash;is this Mr. Rusty? Well, listen
carefully. You are to come right over to the
Manhattan Hotel, across the street from where you
are. A bellboy will be waiting for you at the desk,

What's that? "Warren." He'll be coming right

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Now get the clerk downstairs, and tell
them to look out for Rusty and send him up here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Hello, hello! I'm expecting a man&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> A colored man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> A colored man. To get some things.
He will come right to the desk. Please send him
up at once. It is very important. (<span class="smcap">Jarvis</span> <i>takes

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Fine! (<i>Spreading steamer rug on trunk

Take these, with our baggage, to the steamship

Keep in your stateroom and sit tight till you hear

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> I think so&mdash;yes, it's going&mdash;there it goes&mdash;through!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Haven't time. I'll widen this one a little.
Remember this trunk must not go in the hold of the

I will lie with my head this way. I'll put the shears
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Why did you say that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> I'm sorry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Oh, I didn't mean it that way. I mean
that you're different from the popular idea of a

Just a minute, Porter. How did that lock get broken?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> (<i>Frightened, but trying not to show
it</i>) It was broken when I came.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Detective.</span> How long have you been here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> We came yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> We sail this morning for Europe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Detective.</span> Huh! Excuse me, Madame, but the
police are making an investigation and they would
like to take in this room. Do you mind?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Detective.</span> What time does your boat sail?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> We are sailing at nine o'clock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess</span>. How did you find me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke</span>. It wasn't easy. Spain had no attraction
for me after you left, and I followed. Is not that
true devotion? (<i>Two long whistles.</i> <span class="smcap">Princess</span> <i>gets

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>that Exalted Cousin returns, I'll be all right. Hm&mdash;ouch!&mdash;I
wonder what the game is? (<i>Knock at

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> I came in that trunk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rusty.</span> You came in that trunk?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rusty.</span> No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Are you sure?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rusty.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Did you look?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rusty.</span> No, sir. (<i>Handle of door</i> <span class="smcap">r</span>. <i>rattles.</i>
<span class="smcap">Jarvis</span> <i>to open door.</i> Princess <i>enters.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rusty.</span> How de do, Mrs. Princess?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> How do you do, Rusty? (<i>Exclamation</i>
<span class="smcap">c.r.</span>) Oh, there you are! You're all right, aren't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> (<i>Rubbing sore places</i>) Yes, I'm all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> But your hand&mdash;you must have that attended to at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> That's all right. I'll see the ship's surgeon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Do, please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> (<span class="smcap">r</span>.) You can go now, Rusty. Oh, listen!
What is the number of your stateroom?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rusty.</span> Number Seven twenty-nine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Seven twenty-nine. Now get this: Go
there, lock yourself in, and don't talk to anyone.
You're deaf and dumb&mdash;understand?&mdash;deaf and dumb.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rusty.</span> I got you first. (<i>Exit upper deck.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>Princess.</span> There is something I must tell you.
My cousin, the Duke D'Alva, is on board this boat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> (<i>Whimsically</i>) He professes to love you
devotedly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> You overheard?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> (<i>Pointing to trunk</i>) The trunk. It
wasn't my idea, you know. (<i>With feeling&mdash;yet
knowledge</i>) You are afraid of him? Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Well, he is very powerful&mdash;and I may
be driven into his hands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> You mean&mdash;you might have to marry him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> (<i>Looking nervously toward door</i> <span class="smcap">c.</span>)
Yes, if you fail.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> (<i>Breath being taken away</i>) If I fail&mdash;Say,
hold on a minute! Things are coming too fast
for me. I&mdash;you&mdash;how do I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> (<i>Interrupting</i>) He may come back
any minute&mdash;and I don't dare tell him what happened
at the Manhattan Hotel&mdash;but he will want to
know who you are and why you are with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> That's what I want to know. You forget
I am completely in the dark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> (<i>Looking out of window</i>) The police
can't be on board now. (<i>Down stage.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> (<i>Going to window beside her, and then
back again</i>) You can't tell until you see who goes
ashore with the pilot. They may be working on
Rusty as a clue, but it won't lead them to anything
so long as they don't connect him with me. We'll
take no chances until we get past the danger line.
Now let's get down to business. What is the matter&mdash;and
what am I to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> (<i>Hesitating</i>) I hardly know how to
begin&mdash;it seems absurd in this broad daylight to talk
of ghosts&mdash;but the fact is, my castle is haunted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> (<i>Laughing</i>) Spooks?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> (<i>Very seriously</i>)
Call it anything you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
like, but the castle is haunted, just the same. My
grandfather was one of the wealthiest nobles in
Spain. When he died my father went to take possession
of his estate in Segura. He found the town
full of weird stories of uncanny happenings&mdash;the
castle was deserted, everyone had fled and all told
of something in armor that stalked the halls at night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> O-o-o-o-o-o-o-h!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> My father laughed at the silly natives
and said he would go into the castle and show them
how foolish their fears were. He went, and was
never seen again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> (<i>Naturally deeply interested</i>) What happened
to him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> No one knows. He disappeared&mdash;vanished
utterly, without leaving a single clue&mdash;and the treasure's gone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> (<i>More interested at word Treasure</i>)
Treasure&mdash;what treasure?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> My grandfather is known to have converted
all his wealth into Spanish gold. It amounted
to about a million dollars in your money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> How long ago was that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Fifteen years ago. Since then two
other men have disappeared&mdash;just as my father did&mdash;and
now, the Duke tells me that my brother has
entered the castle. You see it runs in the blood. Up
to a week ago my brother had sent me a cable every
day, then suddenly the messages ceased. All this
week not a word. Now I know&mdash;my brother has entered
the castle, and&mdash;well, that is the end.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Why did you leave Spain?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> A part of the legend was that a plan
had been made showing just where the treasure was
located&mdash;but this plan could never be found. Only
by accident I learned that this plan had been hidden
in the back of a locket and the locket, I discovered,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>had been sold and was in America. It was to find
this locket that I left my brother and came here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Then my work now is to find your
brother and solve the mystery? All right! We'll
explain to the Duke that you are taking me to Spain
for no other purpose than to solve the mystery. In
America we've had trust-breakers and strike-breakers,
and now why not Jarvis, the Ghost Breaker?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Why, yes, why not? Carlos would
believe almost anything of you Americans.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> (<i>Whimsically</i>) And you will tell him
you have made me a&mdash;er&mdash;what is it? A vassal?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> (<i>Almost shyly</i>) I think not&mdash;not just yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> By the way, your&mdash;er&mdash;just how should
a perfectly good vassal address his Princess?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> (<i>Hesitatingly</i>) Highness&mdash;is correct.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Highness&mdash;tell me, your Highness, a vassal
doesn't amount to much, does he? I thought he was a piker.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> (<i>Mystified</i>) A piker&mdash;a man who
carries a pike?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> (<i>Trying to explain</i>) No, no&mdash;a piker is
a tin horn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Tin horn?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Well, a sort of pawn in this game of
chess&mdash;along with your kings and queens and castles
and things. (<i>Seriously, yet playfully</i>) Could a
good, hard-working, reliable vassal work his way
up to be a Duke or a Lord, or something like that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> (<i>Almost playing with him</i>) You're
an ambitious vassal, aren't you? I'm afraid you
wouldn't be content with being anything less than a
king.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> (<i>Meaningly</i>) A king&mdash;a prince&mdash;or a bandit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> A bandit? And why a bandit?</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>Jarvis.</span> A king might command&mdash;a prince request&mdash;a bandit seize.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Seize what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> (<i>Daringly</i>) That which a mere vassal
can only admire. (<i>Knock at door. Both brought back to earth.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> There he is now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Hooray!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> What shall I call you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> (<i>Whispering</i>) Oh, any old thing&mdash;Warren,
Mr. Warren. (<i>Pause.</i> <span class="smcap">Princess</span> <i>crosses to

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Oh, I'm intruding. (<i>Spoken as though
he expected</i> <span class="smcap">Jarvis</span> <i>to go.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Allow me to present Mr. Warren,
whom I am bringing from America to solve the mystery
of the castle. My cousin, Duke D'Alva. (<i>She
crosses</i> <span class="smcap">l.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> (<i>Cross to</i> <span class="smcap">Duke</span>&mdash;<i>easily</i>) Glad to know
You. (<span class="smcap">Princess</span> <i>back</i> <span class="smcap">r.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> (<i>Patronizingly</i>) I am honored. Interesting
task you have undertaken. May I ask if that is
your regular profession?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> That is my business, solving mysteries,
looking up the family skeleton, hunting out spooks.
What we call in America a Ghost Breaker!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Ghost Breaker? A strange calling. I indeed
never heard of anything more extraordinary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> It is not surprising, your Excellency. We
are living in an age of specialists&mdash;and like every
other profession, this calls for its own peculiar training.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> (<i>Interrupting</i>) I am so glad you are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>here, cousin&mdash;you will be able to tell Mr. Warren,
so much better than I, all the circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> I'll be delighted to throw any light I can
on the mystery, but first tell me&mdash;(<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Princess</span>)&mdash;why
did you leave your brother to come to America?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> (<i>Takes locket from reticule</i>) This
little locket is what brought me to America.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> (<i>Crosses to her, holding out hand to take
it</i>) May I see it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> (<i>Takes out memo.</i>) No, Carlos, you
may see the locket&mdash;no one must see the memorandum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Memorandum?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> (<i>Seated on trunk&mdash;to</i> <span class="smcap">Duke</span>)
A wise precaution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> (<i>Picking up locket</i>) Curious old piece
of work&mdash;and you came all the way to America for this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> You were very fortunate to find it so
soon. (<i>Cross</i> <span class="smcap">r.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> I knew where to go to find it&mdash;and yet
I was nearly too late. Think of it, after that dear
old locket had lain in an antique shop for ten years,
suddenly in one day there came two inquiries for it.
(<span class="smcap">Jarvis</span> <i>sits looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Carlos.</span>) Mine was the second.
A distinguished-looking gentleman had been
there in the morning, described it roughly to the old
man and got him to hunt for it. He had just found
it when I came in. I doubled the distinguished-looking
gentleman's offer and got it. (<i>Another look
at</i> <span class="smcap">Duke.</span>) Who do you suppose wanted that locket,
Carlos?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> (<span class="smcap">r.</span><i>, being cornered and with effort to
throw it off lightly</i>) I see that it has already
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>occurred to you that I am the distinguished-looking
gentleman whose offer you doubled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> (<i>With curiosity</i>) But how did you
learn about the memorandum, Carlos? (<span class="smcap">Jarvis</span> <i>sits
on trunk.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> I didn't, Cousin. I had not the slightest
suspicion that the locket contained the supposed secret.
I was merely following my pet hobby, trying
to recover some of those precious heirlooms which
have been scattered to the four winds. (<i>Quickly</i>)
You would be surprised, Mr. Warren, to see the
collection I have already rescued and which some
day may be yours, Maria.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> (<i>Breaking in impatiently</i>) Well, so much
for the treasure. Now let's hear about the ghost.
What's your opinion of this, your Excellency? Do
you put any stock in ghosts?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Yes, Mr. Warren, I am convinced there
are such things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> You believe that this castle is haunted?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> I know it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> You think this ghost is dangerous to encounter&mdash;that
it is the cause of the deaths and disappearances in the castle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Well, what do you think about that?
Ghosts&mdash;&mdash; That's a pretty broad term, your Excellency.
Can you tell me just what you believe this ghost is?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> There are certain occult forces in this
world, Mr. Warren, that science cannot fathom, and
some of them are manifested in that castle now. A
priest might call it a demon or a fiend; a psychologist,
perhaps a returning spirit. I can't say&mdash;but I
know there is something real, a malignant force
which lurks in that castle, and while it haunts those
halls, it is madness for any man to expose himself there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>Jarvis.</span> Have you ever seen this ghost?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> My brother has.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Twice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Good night!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> So has my father, and the others when
they disappeared. No one has seen it three times and lived.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> (<i>Interrupting and looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Duke</span>) In
just what way do you connect this spook with the treasure?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Spook? I see no connection. What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Oh, there is always money where the ghost walks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> I don't know what your experience has
been, Mr. Warren. You are evidently a brave man&mdash;but
you have yet to encounter a real ghost.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Brave! It takes no bravery to fight a
coward. That is what this ghost is&mdash;it's a coward
like every other ghost. I tell you that men are not
half so afraid of spirits as spirits are afraid of men.
Face the supernatural&mdash;and it is beaten to a frazzle
before the fight begins. Spooks&mdash;horse-thieves&mdash;and
peevish wild-cats can all be tamed by the same little charm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> (<i>Mystified</i>) Charm?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> (<i>Leaning forward</i>) What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> I'd hate to tell you. It's part of my system.
(<i>Taking out pistol.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> (<i>Scornfully</i>) I had been hoping, Mr.
Warren, that you had some subtle method of handling
this problem, but you evidently propose to meet
the forces of the supernatural with firearms. I&mdash;I
may tell you that this specter has been shot at before
without the slightest effect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> (<i>Smiling</i>) Quite likely, your Excellency.
I have seen rifle fire that had not the slightest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>effect on a wild-cat for the very reason that the
firing was wilder than the cat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> (<i>As though pitying him</i>) I am sorry for
you Mr. Warren. You will find the ghost more real than the treasure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> (<i>Rising</i>) But the treasure is real,
Carlos. Would I have crossed the ocean for this
locket unless I knew? Why, with this paper anybody&mdash;a
total stranger&mdash;could walk right up to the
very stone that hides it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> (<i>Meaningly</i>) Pretty dangerous paper to
have around. Look out somebody does not get there ahead of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> (<i>Meaningly to</i> <span class="smcap">Jarvis</span>) Yes, it is a dangerous
paper&mdash;if it leads anyone into the castle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> (<i>Laughingly</i>) Well, your Excellency,
I'd go a long way for the fun of unravelling a good
mystery with a little spice of danger thrown in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> You needn't have gone so far, Mr. Warren.
You are leaving a very unusual case behind
you in New York. The papers are full of it. Have
you read them? (<i>Picking up newspaper.</i>) It will
interest you too, Cousin. You were at the Manhattan
last night, I believe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Yes!
(<span class="smcap">Jarvis</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Princess</span> <i>look at
each other and</i> <span class="smcap">Duke</span> <i>reads from newspaper.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Why, no&mdash;&mdash; (<i>Glancing at trunk.</i>) I
was so wrapped up in my baggage I really didn't
have a chance. (<i>Looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Princess.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> "Pistol duel in Manhattan Hotel. Colonel
James Marcum, a prominent and wealthy Kentuckian,
nearly met his death at five o'clock this
morning in a pistol duel in his room at the Manhattan
Hotel." (<i>Glancing down a little further</i>) "At
a late hour the police had no clue to the identity of
his assailant, except the remarkable fact that the
person is still hiding somewhere in the hotel."</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>Jarvis.</span> (<i>Interrupting</i>) He's probably a long way
from the hotel by this time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> (<i>Looking at paper</i>) They say that he
couldn't have gotten out without being seen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> That's the theory of the police or reporters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> What do you think?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> He might have escaped in a thousand
ways&mdash;but that work is hardly in my line. That
belongs to the "Gum-shoes."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Gum-shoes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Yes, ordinary detectives. (<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Nita.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nita.</span> Excuse, Madame&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> No, Nita! Not just yet. I'll call you when I want you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> We are keeping you from getting settled,
I am afraid. (<i>Cross toward door.</i>) So, if you will
excuse me, I'll see you at luncheon, perhaps.
Hooray! I am glad to have made your acquaintance, your Excellency.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Thank you, Mr. Warren, I find you most
interesting. I shall be glad to hear more of your
remarkable profession. (<span class="smcap">Warren</span> <i>crosses to door
and opens it, disclosing two detectives and steward.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Detective.</span> Are you Miss M. T. Ar&mdash;ra&mdash;gan?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> (<span class="smcap">l.c.</span>) Yes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Detective.</span> You was at the Manhattan Hotel last night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Detective.</span> The lock on your door was broken?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Detective.</span> (<i>Removes hat</i>) I am from headquarters,
Madame, and I have orders to clear up one
or two little matters with that affair at the hotel last night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Orders, orders! To break in here&mdash;what headquarters?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Detective.</span> Police headquarters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>Duke.</span> Do you know whom you are addressing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Detective.</span> Say&mdash;that will be about all from you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Yes, Carlos. Please let me attend to
this matter. Won't you come in, gentlemen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Detective.</span> Thanks. (<i>Realizing they are already
in the room</i>) That's all, Steward. (<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Steward;</span>
<i>enter</i> <span class="smcap">Detectives</span>, <i>closing door.</i>
<span class="smcap">Jarvis</span> <i>slips wounded hand into coat pocket.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Yes, we were just discussing that mystery, Inspector.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> You are, I take it, one of the&mdash;er&mdash;gum-shoes?
(<span class="smcap">Jarvis</span> <i>laughs and goes up stage.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Detective.</span> (<i>Glaring angrily for a moment, walks
over toward him and shouts in his face</i>) Gum-shoe!
Say, are you trying to be funny?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Well, sir, you are talking rather loud and
with undue asperity. I presume I have offended you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Detective.</span> <i>You presume!</i> That's a hot one!
Say, who are you, anyhow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> I am Carlos Hernando Duke D'Alva. I
have other titles, but they would hardly interest you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Detective.</span> Dook de Alver&mdash;and then some, eh?
Ain't that nice? Well, if you was the Archbishop
of Canterbury I'd run yer in and take yer 'shore if
yer give me any more lip! (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Princess</span>, <i>sucks his
teeth contemptuously and turns his back on</i> <span class="smcap">Duke.</span>
<i>Produces notebook from pocket and addresses</i>
<span class="smcap">Princess.</span>) As you was saying when we was interrupted,
you was in the hotel when the shooting occurred. Did you hear it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Yes, I heard two shots.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Detective.</span> Did you hear anything else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Yes, I heard some people running near my door.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Detective.</span> Any one come in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Yes, my maid was frightened and came in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>Detective.</span> Aha! How did the lock on your door get broken?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> It was broken when I came. I explained
all that at the hotel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Detective.</span> Um&mdash;all right. What about the colored
man who came to your room and carried away a large bundle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> That was my servant. I sent for him.
They were purchases I made too late to put in my
trunk. They are here, unopened; you may examine
them if you wish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Detective.</span> That's all right, Miss, but what do
you know about this? (<i>Produces knife from pocket&mdash;walks
slowly to her, examining it.</i>) The initial on it is "W."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Did I leave that? Thank you. I'm
so glad you found it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Detective.</span> Then it's yours? Who is W? Your
name is Aragon, I believe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> I am Maria Theresa of Aragon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Detective.</span> But who is W?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Why, er, it isn't W&mdash;you had it upside
down. It is M&mdash;Maria Theresa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Detective.</span> That's all right, ma'am. Now there's
just one thing more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> (<i>Cross and touch</i> <span class="smcap">Detective</span> <i>on arm</i>)
You will pardon me, but I wish to inform you that
this man's name is Warren&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Detective.</span> (<i>Crossing toward him</i>) Say! Who's
conducting this inquiry, you er me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> But, my dear man&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Detective.</span> I am not your dear man. Cut that!
You get out of here. (<i>Forces him toward door.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Yes, do go, Carlos. Leave us to attend
to this matter. I am sure we can finish this better without you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> I merely wished to point out&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Detective.</span> (<i>Interrupting and hustling</i> <span class="smcap">Duke</span>

<i>cross to</i> <span class="smcap">Duke.</span>) Cut it, or out yer goes,
and if ye butt in again I'll fan yer. Do you hear?
(<span class="smcap">Second Detective</span> <i>slaps</i> <span class="smcap">Duke</span> <i>on arm, motions
him to door</i> <span class="smcap">r.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> (<i>At door</i>) Infernal outrage! I shall report
this to the King!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Detective.</span> To the King, huh? Did you get
that, Tom? Well, what do you know about that?
(<span class="smcap">Second Detective</span> <i>closes door.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Don't be disturbed, gentlemen; he's quite
harmless. You heard him talking about the King&mdash;he
suffers from Regalmania. He has grandiose ideas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Detective.</span> (<i>Aside</i>) What does that mean, Tom?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Detective.</span> (<i>With gesture to head</i>) Wheels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Detective.</span> You mean he is crazy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Yes, he is at times; but he is not at all dangerous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Detective.</span> You lookin' out for him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Yes, that's my job.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Detective.</span> Sorry I had to be rough with him
like that, Miss, but you saw he was gumming the
game. I'm going back to New York in the pilot
boat shortly and there wasn't no time to waste. Now
just one question more. How do you account for
the blood on that knob of your door?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Blood, on my door&mdash;&mdash; Why, I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> I think I can explain that, Inspector.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Detective.</span> Go ahead, then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> (<i>Cross</i> <span class="smcap">c.</span>) Allow me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> The colored man, the one you were talking
about, the one who brought the bundle, that
bundle there, carelessly broke the blade of that knife
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>and cut his hand. That was it, wasn't it? You see
the large blade is snapped off near the handle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Detective.</span> Where is this colored man now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> He is in stateroom 729.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Detective.</span> All right, I will just take a look at
him. 729? Sorry to bother you. They was the
Chief's orders. Good-bye. (<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> But his hand isn't cut.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> (<i>Cross to 'phone</i>) No, not yet&mdash;but it
soon will be. Hello, give me 729. (<i>Pause.</i>) Hello,
hello, hello, Rusty? Damn it all, answer me, do you
hear me? (<i>Pause.</i>) Yes, I know I did, but I am
telling you to talk now. Do just what I tell you
and do it quick. Take your knife and cut your left
hand. What? No, no, you a&mdash;damned fool, don't
cut it off, but just enough to make it bleed a little
and then tie it up with a handkerchief. Never
mind. Do it quick, and remember, don't answer
questions. You're deaf and dumb again.
(<i>Hangs up receiver and turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Princess.</span>)
By gee, you're
game! You certainly buffaloed that Detective.
Then your cousin Carlos broke in at the psychological
moment to scatter their gum-shoe wits. (<i>Laugh.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> They believe he's crazy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> That's just it. Now they won't listen to
him. Yes, he'll be crazy, all right. Do you think
you can handle him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Yes, you have your hand dressed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Then I'll hunt up the ship's surgeon&mdash;and
be back directly. Gee, you're game! (<i>Cross to

<p><span class="smcap"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>Duke.</span> For some explanation. Who is this man Warren?</p>

he explained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> How did you find him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vardos.</span> I gave up hope when the Prince went
into the castle. Tonight I waited till an hour past
sundown, and twice I called. Once a wail came back
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>to me. It sounded like a sigh of the damned. When
I called the second time, something moved in the turret
of the keep, like a man waving; and my heart
leaped for joy. Then, with a harsh cry, a black,
ugly bird flew from the turret straight toward where
the sun had set&mdash;on my left, mind you, the sinister
side, the left, the left! (<i>Castanets heard off stage,

<p><span class="smcap">Vardos</span>. What can she do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dolores</span>. She would go straight to the castle, and
will Segura have it said that they let her go alone as
they did the Prince?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vardos</span>. God forbid it should come to that.

table</i> <span class="smcap">l.</span>, <i>back to audience</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dolores.</span> Pardon, Senor. Her Highness wishes
me to tell you that she will be down directly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Thank you, Senorita, and who, may I
ask, was the cheerful individual that flattered me
with such a toast?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dolores.</span> (<i>At</i> <span class="smcap">c.</span>, <i>looking after</i>
<span class="smcap">Robledo</span>&mdash;<i>crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">Jarvis</span>) Don Robledo, Senor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Don Robledo&mdash;sounds dangerous, but
doesn't mean much to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dolores.</span> It may mean much before you reach
the castle. Let me tell you something. Quick, your
hand, Senor! No, the other one. (<i>Grasps his hand.</i>)
I'll pretend to read your palm. Every one of those
breaks in your life-line means a moment when you
stood face to face with death, and yet, see those little
squares of protection around each break! Senor
American, there is one break which you have not yet
reached, and the protecting square is not perfect like the others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> I reckon that square will take care of
itself when the time comes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dolores.</span> But the time is now, Senor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> So&mdash;and are the senorita's eyes so sharp
that she can tell the day and the hour?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dolores.</span> Not my eyes, Senor American, but my
ears. (<span class="smcap">Duke</span> <i>comes downstairs</i>.) In all my experience
I have seen but one hand like yours&mdash;it speaks
of danger, and that hand belongs to Don Robledo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> (<i>Still on stairs</i>) Well, Mr. Warren!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dolores.</span> Pardon, Senor! (<i>Curtsies to</i> <span class="smcap">Jarvis</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Good-bye, Senorita. Many thanks for
your occult wisdom. I'll take good care of that little

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> (<i>Coming down</i>) Well, Mr. Warren,
looking into the future? (<i>Lays coat on table</i> <span class="smcap">c.</span>
<span class="smcap">Jarvis</span> <span class="smcap">l.c.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Yes, Duke. The immediate future promises
to be very interesting. A dark man is to cross my path.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> (<span class="smcap">r.c.</span>) Do you believe in such foolery?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> I like to, on this occasion, for I hope it
means someone I very much want to meet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Mr. Warren, I feel a certain responsibility
for Her Highness' actions, and the prospect of
your death tonight is most uncomfortable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> You think I won't come back?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> I think if you go to that castle tonight you
take your life in your hands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> I've got a pretty good grip.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Look here. You Americans are shrewd
traders. You get dollar for dollar when you bargain.
You are not giving away your life for nothing.
Now, what was the price?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Oh, not very much. The deal was made
on bargain day. My life happened to be a little below par.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Very well, I will release you from your
end of the bargain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Your Excellency, I am overwhelmed, but
the price is paid and we're on the job, aren't we, Rusty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rusty.</span> Yas, sir, we most certainly is!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> I suppose that means that you will keep
faith with Her Highness?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> I never saw a man quite so anxious to be
killed; but there it is: Fools rush in where angels
fear to tread.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>Jarvis.</span> I'd rather be an energetic fool than an
angel with cold feet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> I am sorry for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> (<i>Crossing to</i> <span class="smcap">Duke</span>) Your Excellency,
I decline your offer and your advice and your sympathy,
and I'll tell you why. I once saw a gambler
lay down four aces. Just think of it: four fat aces.
He looked the dealer straight in the eye and said:
"The play ain't natural." Now, you tried to have
me arrested on the steamer, you have tried to block
me in every move I have made. Now, all of a sudden
you express the utmost anxiety as to what's going
to happen to me in the castle. You even offer
to buy me off. You advise me to stay out. Shall I
take your advice? No. "The play ain't natural."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> You have intruded into a matter which
you neither understand nor appreciate. If, as you
say, the play seems unnatural, throw the cards and
stay out of the game.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> No, I'll stay right in the game, but I am
going to watch the dealer. Well, come along, Rusty.
(<i>Cross to</i> <span class="smcap">Rusty</span>.) Let's see if we can find the
landlord. (<i>Picking up bags.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rusty.</span> I'd like to find a piece of chicken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Chicken, Rusty? What put that in your head?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rusty.</span> I's powerful hungry, Marse Warren.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> What&mdash;again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rusty.</span> No, sir&mdash;it's the same old hunger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Well, Rusty, you are not going to get
anything to eat until we finish the job.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rusty.</span> Good Lord, have I got to wait till you're
dead before I eat? (<i>They start with bags to cross
to stairway. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Princess</span> <i>on stairs</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Well, all Segura will be buzzing with
your ghost hunt tonight. The whole town will sit
up to hear of the outcome.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>Jarvis.</span> And where are you going to get the returns, Duke?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Unfortunately, I must leave at once. I
have an urgent summons to Madrid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Well, that's too bad. I'm sorry you're
leaving us. Won't you even be around at the finish, your Excellency?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> I am sorry, Mr. Warren, but I must go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Well, I call that a shame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> (<i>Coming downstairs&mdash;to</i> <span class="smcap">Pedro</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Your Highness, I'd like a couple of good

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Pedro.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pedro.</span> Yes, your Highness. (<span class="smcap">Pedro</span> <i>exits</i>.)</p>

Mr. Warren? (<span class="smcap">c.</span> <i>Lays hat on table</i> <span class="smcap">c.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> (<i>Over banister</i>) Not in this neck of the

(<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Jarvis</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Rusty</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Carlos, what news of my brother have you heard?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> (<span class="smcap">l.c.</span>) Nothing, Maria.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> And yet you are leaving for Madrid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> The message is from His Majesty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> But why must you go so soon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> You know my ride is a long one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> But, Carlos, my brother may be dying,
dead&mdash;and yet you have not the time and the courage
to help me find him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> What need of me? You have your Ghost Breaker.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> So, Carlos, that is your excuse?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> I make no excuse, Maria. I need none.
That Yankee adventurer stands between you and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>me. Send him away, and I will do anything you
ask. I'll put off my journey now to the King. I'll
send one of my men into the castle to find your brother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Yes, you will send one of your men&mdash;but
you are not brave enough to go there yourself.
Yet you ask me to send away this man who of all is
willing to sacrifice even his life for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> If he stays, I'll go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Very well, then you force me to
choose. I do. I choose a man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> You love him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Perhaps. (<span class="smcap">r.</span> <i>Turns away</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Well, Maria, you are sending him to his
death. (<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Jarvis</span> <i>on stairs</i>.) Success to you,
Mr. Ghost Breaker, when you beard the spectre in
his den. (<i>Takes hat and coat from table.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> (<i>Coming downstairs</i>) Thank you, your
Excellency. (<i>With mock dignity</i>) I'll do my best.
(<i>Changes expression.</i>) To put salt on the spectre's tail.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duke.</span> Good-bye! (<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">l.c.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Good-bye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> (<span class="smcap">c.</span>) Mr. Warren, we must start at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Courage&mdash;if your brother is there, I'll
find him. You must be patient and remain here
where you are safe, and try to rest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> I cannot rest until I know what has
happened to him. I shall go mad if I am left alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> But it is not safe for you to go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Nevertheless, Mr. Warren, I will go
to my brother tonight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Now, my dear child! (<i>Pause.</i>) I beg
your pardon, but please&mdash;oh, please let me insist on one condition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Name it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>Jarvis.</span> Let me go ahead and look over the

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> With a light&mdash;(<i>Cross to window</i> <span class="smcap">l.</span>)&mdash;from
one of those towers. You can see it from here.
You won't have long to wait. It will shine within an hour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> (<span class="smcap">l.c.</span>) But if you&mdash;if it does not shine?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Well, then I'll be too busy swapping lead
for brimstone with Mr. Spook to stop and hang a lantern.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Oh, but you are brave! You must
have the locket with the memorandum. (<i>Start to stairs.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Yes, of course, where is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> It's in my room. I won't be long.
(<i>On stairs.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Suppose you give me that, and we'll start at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Very well. (<i>Exit upstairs and off.</i>)</p>

and all dem horses jumped right on me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> There were only two horses, Rusty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rusty.</span> I was countin' their feet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Well, tie up your shoe and get busy.
(<i>Looking around.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rusty.</span> Yas, sir. (<i>Rises, picks up pieces of
table, crosses to fireplace.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> This room was probably used as a banquet hall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rusty.</span> (<i>Gathering up few pieces of table and
taking them to fireplace, puts them on fire; looks

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Not till we have finished this job.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Well, a black thing followed me, treading

<p><span class="smcap"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>Jarvis.</span> (<i>Looking about</i>) That goes to the Armory.</p>

Ah seen eyes in
there, and a cold, grimy, green, slimy smell in there.
Ain't that where that broad-faced bird flew at me
and I fell down them slippery stairs?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> (<i>Laughing</i>) That broad-faced bird was
an owl, Rusty&mdash;just a common, ordinary owl. You know what an owl is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rusty.</span> O&mdash;ooh&mdash;ooh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> (<i>Sees door</i> <span class="smcap">r.c.</span>) Where can that door
lead to? That's it. (<span class="smcap">Jarvis</span> <i>goes to the door in</i>

That was a close one. (<i>Lantern goes out.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rusty.</span> (<i>Advancing</i>) Lord, Marse Warren,
what is it? (<i>Starts up to Jarvis.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Get back! Give me that lantern.
(<span class="smcap">Rusty</span> <i>hands lantern</i>.)
Give me your hand. Can you hold me?
(<span class="smcap">Rusty</span> <i>holds out hand and</i> <span class="smcap">Jarvis</span> <i>cautiously
steps on trap door; it sinks and other end rises</i>.)
God! I thought so. Water and a long drop! No
wonder people disappear in this castle. Good Lord,
what if her brother went down there? Rusty, whatever
happens, keep clear of this. If you step on this
you will never see Kentucky again for sure.
(<i>Groan heard off left.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rusty.</span> Did you hear that groan?
(<i>Wind changes to low moan.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Groan&mdash;&mdash; There it is again. It sounded
just like a man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rusty.</span> Ough! Ough!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Shut up! (<i>Crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">l.c.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rusty.</span> Marse Warren&mdash;look out!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Listen! (<i>Crosses and stands moment at

crosses to fireplace.</i>) This place is getting on my nerves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rusty.</span> (<span class="smcap">r.c.</span>) That wasn't no wind, Marse

enough human groan. (<i>He looks at picture</i> <span class="smcap">l.</span>)
And Ah want to tell you som'pin' else. Have you
ever been in church or somewhere and all of a sudden
a feelin' come over you that there was eyes a-starin'
at the back of your head? You just knowed
it&mdash;until you couldn't stand it no longer, and just
turned around and see who it was?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Why, yes, Rusty, I have had that happen. Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rusty.</span> That's just the way I feel now, like there
was eyes a-lookin' at me. (<i>Turns to picture.</i>) You
see that picture? Seems like that feller was lookin'
at me&mdash;like he'd step right out of the frame. (<i>He
points to armor on steps.</i>) Or them two battleship
boogies&mdash;just jump right down here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> It's been a good many years since those
boys jumped, Rusty. (<i>Noise off stage of running.</i>)
Hark! Listen! (<i>He crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">l.c.</span>, <i>pistol drawn;
stands listening.</i>) Somebody's running&mdash;coming this
way&mdash;&mdash; (<i>Dull thud at back.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rusty.</span> I want to go home!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> What do you know about that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rusty.</span> I don't want to know nothin' about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> I thought so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rusty.</span> What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> The man with a smoky lantern has been
up those stairs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rusty.</span> You ain't goin' up there, is you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> I am not&mdash;because the Duke or some of
his men are probably waiting for me at the top of
the stairs with a big long gun, and I'm no book hero.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rusty.</span> Suppose it's the Prince?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Well, suppose it is the Prince. He might
blow my head off, because he doesn't know what I
came here for&mdash;and if it's someone else, they'll blow
my head off, because they do know.</p>

They're probably watching every move we make.
That's where that pounding comes from. Why don't

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis.</span> Good boy, Rusty! Now I'll tell you
something. These are his tools. Someone was working

right into the trap. (<i>Crosses</i> <span class="smcap">c.</span>) What I have done

<p><span class="smcap">Jarvis</span>. Which one of us two? (<i>Walking over

tonight you tried to have me murdered. Why didn't
you have the nerve to come out in the open? I told
you all ghosts were cowards&mdash;but you haven't got
the courage of a rabbit. If it weren't for her, I'd
blow your damned head off, and send you down
after that other poor devil! You've got him to answer
for, sooner or later. Now, see here&mdash;give me
that locket&mdash;&mdash; No, give her the locket&mdash;or, by the

<h2>Clarence</h2>

<p>Comedy in 4 acts by Booth Tarkington. 5 males, 5 females. 2
interiors. Costumes, modern. Plays 2&frac12; hours.</p>

<p>One of the "five million", Clarence served where he was sent&mdash;though
it was no further than Texas. As an entomologist he
found&mdash;on this side of the ocean&mdash;no field for his specialty, so
they set him to driving mules.</p>

<p>Now, reduced to civil life and seeking a job, he finds a position
in the home of one Wheeler, a wealthy man with a family.
And because he'd "been in the army" he becomes guide, philosopher
and friend to the members of that distracted family
group. Clarence's position is an anomolous one. He mends the
plumbing, tunes the piano, types&mdash;off stage&mdash;and plays the saxophone.
And around him revolves such a group of characters
as only Booth Tarkington could offer. It is a real American
comedy, at which the audience ripples with appreciative and
delighted laughter.</p>

<p>Those marvelous young people, Cora and Bobby, are portrait
sketches warranted to appeal to everyone.</p>

<p>Royalty, $25.00. Price, 75 cents.</p>


<h2>The Charm School</h2>

<p>Comedy in 3 acts by Alice Duer Miller and Robert Milton.
6 males, 10 females. (May be played by 5 males and 8 females).
(Any number of school girls may be used in the ensembles).
2 interiors. Costumes, modern. Plays 2&frac12; hours.</p>

<p>A young automobile salesman just out of his 'teens inherits a
girl's school and insists on running it himself, according to his
own ideas, chief of which is that the dominant feature in the
education of the young girl of today should be CHARM.</p>

<p>In the end the young man gives up the school and promises
to wait until the youngest of his pupils reaches a marriagable
age.</p>

<p>"The Charm School" has the freshness of youth, the inspiration
of a novel idea, the charm of originality, and wholesome,
amusing entertainment. We strongly recommend it for high
school production.</p>

<p>First produced in New York, then toured the country. Two
companies now playing it in England. Royalty, $25.00. Price,
75 cents.</p>

<h2>A Full House</h2>

<p>Farcical comedy in 3 acts. By Fred Jackson. 7 males, 7
females. 1 interior. Modern costumes. Plays 2&frac12; hours. This
newest and funniest farce was written by Fred Jackson, the
well-known story writer, and is backed up by the prestige of
an impressive New York success and the promise of unlimited
fun presented in the most attractive form. A cleverer farce
has not been seen for many a long day. "A Full House" is a
house full of laughs. Royalty, $25. Price, 75 cents.</p>

<h2>The Famous Mrs. Fair</h2>


<p>A play in 4 acts. By James Forbes, author of "The Commuters",
"The Traveling Salesman", etc. 3 males, 10 females.
2 interiors. Costumes modern. Plays 2&frac12; hours.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fair was a major abroad and won a medal for bravery.
Her husband was displeased when Mrs. Fair came home to a
fame which lifted her out of his life. The dissatisfaction grew
as she became absorbed in public functions. Mr. Forbes traces
the widening of the rift between husband and wife with great
skill in the first two acts. These are light comedy. In the third
the mood becomes serious and we find that Mrs. Fair's absence
from home has set the husband to philandering and the daughter
to intimacy with a gay set. Indeed, only through the joint
efforts of husband and wife to save the girl from danger, is
harmony again established.</p>

<p>A true comedy, written with keen insight. Royalty, $35.00.
Price, 75 cents.</p>


<h2>Nothing But the Truth</h2>

<p>Comedy in 3 acts. By James Montgomery. 5 males, 6 females.
Costumes, modern. 2 interiors. Plays 2&frac12; hours.</p>

<p>Is it possible to tell the absolute truth&mdash;even for twenty-four
hours? It is&mdash;at least Bob Bennett, hero or "Nothing But
the Truth", accomplished the feat. The bet he made with his
business partners, and the trouble he got into is the subject of
William Collier's tremendous comedy hit. "Nothing But the
Truth" can be whole-heartedly recommended as one of the
most sprightly, amusing and popular comedies. Royalty, $25.00.
Price, 60 cents.</p>

<h2>On the Hiring Line</h2>

<p>Comedy in 3 acts, by Harvey O'Higgins and Harriet Ford.
5 males, 4 females. 1 interior. Costumes, modern. Plays 2&frac14;
hours.</p>

<p>Sherman Fessenden, unable to induce servants to remain at
his Jersey home, hits upon the expedient of engaging detectives
as domestics.</p>

<p>His second wife, an actress, weary of the country, has succeeded
in discouraging every other cook and butler against
remaining long, believing that she will convince her husband
that country life is dead. So she is deeply disappointed when
she finds she cannot discourage the new servants.</p>

<p>The sleuths, believing they are called to report on those living
with the Fessendens, warn Fessenden that his wife has been
receiving love-notes from an actor friend, and that his daughter
is planning to elope with a supposed thief.</p>

<p>One sleuth causes an uproar making a mess of the situations
he has witnessed. Fessenden, however, has learned a lesson
and is willing to leave the servant problem to his wife.</p>

<p>Enjoyed long runs in New York and Chicago. Royalty, $25.00.
Price, 75 cents.</p>

<h2>Daddy Long-Legs</h2>


<p>A charming comedy in 4 acts, by Jean Webster. 6 males,
7 females, and 6 orphans, but by easy doubling of some characters,
may be played by 4 males, 4 females and 3 orphans.
The orphans appear only in the first act and may be played
by small girls. 4 easy interiors. Costumes modern. Plays 2&frac12;
hours.</p>

<p>The New York Times wrote the following:</p>

<p>"If you will take your pencil and write down, one below
the other, the words delightful, charming, sweet, beautiful and
entertaining, and then draw a line and add them up, the answer
will be 'Daddy Long-Legs'. To that result you might even add
brilliant, pathetic and humorous, but the answer even then
would be just what it was before&mdash;the play which Miss Jean
Webster has made from her book, 'Daddy Long-Legs'. To attempt
to describe the simplicity and beauty of 'Daddy Long-Legs'
would be like attempting to describe the first breath of
Spring after an exceedingly tiresome and hard Winter."</p>

<p>Enjoyed a two-years' run in New York and was then toured
for over three years. Royalty, $25.00. Price, 75 cents.</p>

<hr class="major" />
<h2>To the Ladies</h2>


<p>A hilarious comedy in 3 acts, by George S. Kaufman and
Marc Connelly. 11 males, 3 females. 3 interiors. Costumes,
modern. Plays 2&frac12; hours.</p>

<p>The authors of "Dulcy" have divulged a secret known to
every woman&mdash;and to some men, though the men don't admit it.</p>

<p>The central figures are young Leonard Beebe and his wife
Elsie, a little girl from Mobile. Leonard is the average young
American clerk, the kind who read all the "Success" stories in
the magazines and believe them. Elsie has determined to make
him something more. She has her hands full&mdash;even has to
make an after dinner speech for him&mdash;but she does it and the
play shows how.</p>

<p>Helen Hayes played Elsie and Otto Kruger impersonated
Leonard in New York, where it ran a whole season. Here's a
clean and wholesome play, deliciously funny and altogether a
diverting evening's entertainment. Royalty, $25.00. Price, 75
cents.</p>


<h2>Three Live Ghosts</h2>

<p>Comedy in 3 acts by Frederick Isham and Max Marcin. 6
males, 4 females (2 policemen). 1 interior throughout. Costumes,
modern. Plays 2&frac12; hours.</p>

<p>"Three Live Ghosts" is brim full of fun and humor and is
sure to keep audiences in gales of laughter. The New York
critics described it as the most ingenious and amusing comedy
of the season, genuinely funny. It played a fall season in
New York, then toured the big cities. A lively comedy of merit.
Royalty, $25.00. Price, 75 cents.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
