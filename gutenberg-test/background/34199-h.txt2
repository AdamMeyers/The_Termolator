CHAPTER I.

THE COUNTRY RECTORY.








OT really; you can't
mean it really!"

"As true as possible.
Mother told me her very
own self," was the emphatic
reply.

Two children, brother and
sister, the boy aged ten, the
girl three years older, were
carrying on this conversation in
the garden of a country rectory.

"But really and truly, on
your word of honour," repeated
Leonard, as though he could
not believe what his sister had just related to him.

"I hope my word is always a word of honour; I
thought everybody's word ought to be that," Sybil
Graham replied a little proudly, for when she had run
quickly to bring such important news to her brother, she[10]
could not help feeling hurt that he should refuse to
believe what she said.

"And we are really going there, and shall actually
see the 'pig-tails' in their own country, and the splendid
kites they fly, and all the wonderful things that father
used to tell us about? Oh! it seems too good to be
true."

"But it is true," Sybil repeated with emphasis.
"And I dare say we might even see tea growing, as it
does grow there, you know, and I suppose we shall be
carried about in sedan-chairs ourselves." She was
really as happy as her brother, only not so excitable.

At this moment their mother joined them. "Oh,
mother!" the boy then exclaimed, "how beautiful!
Sybil has just told me, but I could not believe her."

"I thought the news would delight you both very
much," Mrs. Graham answered. "Your father and I
have been thinking about going to China for some time,
but we would not tell you anything about it until
matters were quite settled, and now everything seems
to be satisfactorily arranged for us to start in three
months' time."

"That will be in August, then," they both said at
once.

"Oh, how very beautiful!" Sybil exclaimed. "I like
my father to be a missionary very much. He must be
glad too; isn't he, mother?"

"Very glad indeed, although the joy will entail
some sadness also. I expect your father will grieve a
good deal to leave this dear little country parish of ours,
and the duties he has so loved to perform here, but a
wider field of usefulness having opened out for him, he
is very thankful to obey the call."[11]



THE CHURCH.
[12]

"And father will do it so well, mother," answered
Sybil. "I wonder whether I shall be able to do anything
to help him there?"

"I think you have long since found out, Sybil,"
was her mother's loving answer, "that you can always
be doing something to help us."

Sybil and Leonard had as yet only learnt a part of
the story. They had still to learn the rest. This going
to China would not be all beautiful, all joy for them,
especially for Sybil, with her very affectionate nature
and dread of saying "Good-byes," for she and Leonard
were only to be taken out on a trip&mdash;a pleasure tour&mdash;to
see something of China, and to return to England to go
on with their education at the end of six months.

Mr. Graham then calling his wife, the children were
again left alone.

It was no easy matter to go as a missionary to China.
This Mr. Graham well knew, for his father, although
only for a short time, had been one over there before
him, and had discovered&mdash;what so many other later
brother missionaries have found out also&mdash;that to obtain
even a hearing on the subject of religion from a Chinaman,
who has been trained and brought up to be a
superstitious idolater, very vain of his wisdom and
antiquity as a nation, and to look upon Europeans as
barbarians, is often a most difficult matter.

Eighteen years before Mr. Graham the elder went out
to Peking as one of the first missionaries to China, and
his only son, who had then just qualified for the medical
profession, accompanied him. A year later, the father
dying, his son returned at once to England, but with a
changed mind, determined now to seek holy orders and
enter the ministry, instead of following his profession,[13]
so as by thus doing to add one more to the number of
earnest clergy that his short stay in China had shown
him were so much needed. To carry out his resolution,
he went to Oxford to prepare, and soon after his ordination
he married, and settled down, in the little country
village, where we find him, surrounded by his little
family.

Often since then had he contemplated leaving
England for missionary work, but until now he had
been prevented from carrying his wishes into effect.

His knowledge of medicine had not been lost to him,
for many a sufferer in the little, yet wide-spreading
country parish, who lived at too great a distance to send
for the doctor for a slight ailment, had been very thankful,
when the clergyman came in to read and pray with
him, to learn from him what his slight ailment was,
and how he could prevent its becoming a great one.

And this knowledge would be most helpful and
invaluable in China, where Mr. Graham knew that the
science of medicine was held in veneration by the
inhabitants, and gained a ready admission to those who
were glad to be cured of bodily ailments, but knew not
how sick their souls were.

The missionary's slight acquaintance with the
Chinese dialect, which, when time permitted, he had
endeavoured to keep up, would also be of service to him
when he arrived in China; for although the dialects of
the south, where he was going, were very different from
those of the north, the Mandarin, or Court language,
spoken by the officials, was understood in every part.

"That's why father's been reading all those books
lately with the pig-tail pictures in, and wonderful kites,
and why he has been studying the language without[14]
an alphabet," Leonard said, when he and his sister were
again alone. "If I hadn't been at school so much, I expect
I should have found out what was going to happen."

"I don't believe we should ever find out anything
that father did not wish us to know, however much we
wanted to do so," answered Sybil. "But isn't it
splendid?&mdash;all but one thing, and that is having to leave
everybody, and my best friend Lily Keith. I shan't
like doing that at all."

"And I shall miss my friends too, of course," said
Leonard; "but then I expect we shall make some new
ones; and I thought you were so fond of writing letters.
Why, you could write splendid ones from China, and
tell Lily what we see, and perhaps mother would draw
you some pictures for them, for she can draw anything,
you know."

Sybil was comforted, for she was very fond of writing
letters, and her friend, she knew, would be very glad to
have some from China.

Directly after the six o'clock dinner was the
children's hour with father, who, being a very busy man,
had to regulate all his time; but this one hour a day
belonged entirely to his family, and unless anything unforeseen
happened, they had and claimed every moment
of it.

Sybil came down-stairs first, and going up to her
father, who was sitting by a large bow window, gazing
out of it, with a very serious look on his face, she said
with surprise as she kissed him: "You look sad, dear
father. Aren't you glad to go to China?"

He drew her on to his knee.

"Very glad, my darling," was the answer; "but
I was just picturing to myself some farewells that[15]
will have to be taken. I shall be very sorry, too,
to say 'Good-bye' here, where our lives have been so
blessed and our prayers so abundantly answered. We
cannot help feeling sorry to leave our old friends,
can we?"

"But you don't look, father," she continued, "as if
that were all that you had been thinking."

"I dare say it was also about the work in which I
am so soon to engage, for that, Sybil, is full of grave responsibility;
but now I think it is my turn to ask what
your thoughts are," he went on, for at that moment
Sybil was looking quite as grave as, just before, her
father could have looked.

"I was remembering two verses of a piece of poetry
that I learnt last term at school, which I think must
have been written for missionaries," she replied.



MAP OF CHINA.


Her father then asking her to repeat them to him,
Sybil said:&mdash;


"Sow ye beside all waters,
Where the dew of heaven may fall;
Ye shall reap, if ye be not weary,
For the Spirit breathes o'er all.
Sow, though the thorns may wound thee;
One wore the thorns for thee;
And, though the cold world scorn thee,
Patient and hopeful be.
Sow ye beside all waters,
With a blessing and a prayer,
Name Him whose hand upholds thee,
And sow thou everywhere.

"Work! in the wild waste places,
Though none thy love may own;
God guides the down of the thistle
[17]The wandering wind hath sown.
Will Jesus chide thy weakness,
Or call thy labour vain?
The Word that for Him thou bearest
Shall return to Him again.
On!&mdash;with thine heart in heaven,
Thy strength&mdash;thy Master's might,
Till the wild waste places blossom
In the warmth of a Saviour's light."


"Thank you, Sybil," said her father. "I am sure
you will make a capital little missionary's daughter some
day."

"To what part of China are we going, father?"
she then asked; "to the same place where you were
before?"

"No; quite in another direction. You know when I
was last in China I was at Peking, in the north, and
now I am to be in Hong-Kong, an island in the south;
but we shall not go there direct, as I wish to take you
to see several places before finally landing."

"Wait a minute, please, father," Sybil then exclaimed,
"while I just fetch my map to look them out
as you tell them to me." And as she spoke she ran off,
to return the next minute with an atlas, in which she
found these places as her father mentioned them:
Shanghai, Amoy, the Island of Formosa, Swatow,
Hong-Kong, Macao, and Canton.

"I wish, father, you would tell us some day all you
can remember about Peking," then said Leonard, as he
ran in and joined his father and sister, having till now been
very busy, first coaxing his good friend the gardener to
help him cut and put up some roosts in the fowl-house,
and then showing his handiwork to his mother. "You[18]
know what I mean: something like what you used to
tell us."



LEONARD IN THE GARDEN.


"I will try to arouse up my memory, and tell
you what I can on board ship, when we shall have, I[19]
suppose, seven or eight weeks with very little to do,
and when you will, no doubt, be glad of some true
stories to while away the time."

"I wish we were going to start to-morrow," rejoined
Leonard, who was, I am afraid, a boy without a particle
of that virtue which we call "patience." He wanted
his mother now to go into the poultry-yard with him to
see the roosts he had, and as she liked to enter into
all his pleasures and useful occupations, she was very
pleased to go.

Before either of them came in again, Sybil had
heard "the rest" from her father; that she and Leonard
were, after a six months' long holiday in China, to
return to England to continue their education. It was
a terrible blow to her, to whom a long separation
from her parents seemed almost like an impossibility.
Her bright eyes filled with tears.

"Oh, father!" she said; "and leave you and
mother?"

"It must be for a time, my darling, till your
education is completed, as your mother and I both
wish you to remain at the school where you are, but
when school-days are over, about four years hence, I
hope to be able to have you out with us. It will be
longer for poor old Leonard, won't it?"

"I don't think I care to go to China now, father,"
Sybil then said.

"Oh yes you do, Sybil," was the answer; "you like
your father to be a missionary very much, you know,
do you not?" Her mother had repeated this saying.
"And, my child," he continued, "you know that it
must be a dreadful trial for so very good and loving
a mother as yours to part from her children; but now[20]
that a call has come to me to do my Master's work
in a foreign land, and she is helping me to obey it,
you would not make her trial greater, would you, by
letting her see you sad? Oh no! I know you would
not; but you would help us to do our duty more
bravely. Is it not so, my child?"

Sybil buried her face on her father's shoulder, and
sobbed, but on seeing her mother coming up the
garden towards them, she quickly wiped her tears away,
and tried to look cheerful. Her father had gone wisely
to work in giving her such a reason for trying to
overcome her sorrow, and he knew that now she
would set herself bravely to work to help, and not to
hinder, her parents' undertaking.

And they were not to be parted for nearly another
year, she said to herself, and meanwhile they were to
have all sorts of enjoyments with their parents.

Mrs. Graham brought a message from Leonard for
Sybil to go and see his roosts, which she at once obeyed,
affectionately kissing her mother as she passed her.
That was to say that she knew, and a great deal more.

Another piece of news Sybil now conveyed to Leonard,
and as she told it, even he could not tell that it made
her very unhappy. I wonder if he believed at once this
time!



[21]








CHAPTER II.

THE FIRST PEEP.




HE missionary's family party had
set sail, and the steamship, in which
they were passengers, was now
fairly out at sea.

As far as money was concerned,
Mr. Graham had no anxieties, for
being the only son of a very wealthy
man, who had lost his wife some
time before he died himself, Mr.
Graham had, at his father's death, inherited the whole
of his large fortune.

"Now, father, don't you think it's high time you
began to tell us about old Peking?" Leonard said, a few
days after they had sailed. "I did not ask you at
first, because we had plenty to do to look about us, but
now that there's nothing in the world but water to see
anywhere, we should so like to hear some stories; so
please begin, if it won't trouble you too much."

And sitting on deck, with Sybil on his right and
Leonard on his left, Mr. Graham did as he was requested,
and gave his children what they considered[22]
a very interesting description of a portion of that vast
empire which they were so soon to visit. "The Chinese,"
he began, "are a very ancient race, so ancient, indeed,
that the origin of their monarchy is not known."

"Do you mind waiting one minute, father, just to
tell me a thing I have forgotten, and you told me once?"
Leonard asked. "What does the word China mean?"

"The ancient name for China, Tien-sha, means
'inferior only to heaven.' Chinese history begins with
the fabulous ages, two or three million years ago,
when the Chinese say that no land but theirs was inhabited,
and gods reigned upon the earth, which was
made for them. After the gods, they tell us, came
mythical kings, who were giants, had the power of
working miracles, and lived for thousands of years; but
it is really supposed that the first people who passed
beyond the deserts of Central Asia settled in the province
of Shen-si, which borders on Tartary, and here laid the
foundation of the present monarchy of China.

"Some Chinese historians think that their first
mortal Emperor was Fuh-hi, whose date of coming to
the throne is fixed as early as 2,852 years b.c. He is
described as possessing great virtues, and was called
by his subjects the 'Son of heaven'&mdash;a title which
is still given to Emperors of China, who are foolishly
supposed, by some of their subjects, to be of celestial
origin. He is said to have taught them how to keep
laws and to live peaceably, also to have invented the
arts of music and numbers. Certainly the Chinese
have understood music from very early ages, and class
it among the chief of the sciences.



MUSICIANS.


"They have at least fifty different kinds of wind and
string musical instruments, made of wood, stone, or metal,[24]
and they play a great deal, but especially upon their fiddle
instruments. They do not like our music at all.

"But now we must go back to a little more Chinese
history. There is nothing to prove that the Chinese
existed as a nation before the time of Yu the Great,
whose date of accession is said to be 2,285 years b.c.,
and he is also included in the Legendary Period to
which Fuh-hi belongs. After the Legendary Period
came the Semi-Historical Period in Chinese history;
the really Historical Period dating from the early part
of the eighth century before Christ.

"Different dynasties succeeded each other, till from
the years 500 to 200 b.c. many petty kings, reigning
over various provinces, waged war against one
another. At length a fierce warrior, named Ching-wang,
went to war with, and conquered, all of them,
and made himself master of the whole empire, about 200
years b.c., his government comprising about the northern
half of modern China. He was the first monarch of the
dynasty called Tsin, or Chin. Next he turned his arms
against the Tartars, who were a portion of those people
whom we read of in history by the name of Huns, and who
were now making constant inroads into China. They were
capital soldiers&mdash;I believe every Tartar has now to be a
soldier&mdash;and as the Chinese dreaded them very much,
the Emperor thought out a way to keep them off. He
erected a great wall along the whole extent of the
northern frontier of China, of very great height, thickness,
and strength, made of two walls of brick many feet
apart, the space between them being, for half the length
of the wall, filled up with earth, and the other half with
gravel and rubbish. On it were square towers, which
were erected at about a hundred yards' distance from[25]
one another. Some say this wall extended 1,500 miles
from the sea to the most western provinces of Shen-si;
McCulloch says it is 1,250 miles in length. It was
carried over mountains and across rivers. Six horsemen
could ride abreast upon it. But there was great
cruelty practised in its construction, for the Emperor
obliged every third labouring man in the kingdom to
work at this wall without payment.



GREAT WALL OF CHINA, GULF OF PE-CHI-LI.


"It took five years to finish, and has now existed for
more than two thousand years. It is called Wan-li-chang,
or Myriad-mile Wall."

"And did it keep out the Tartars?" Leonard asked.[26]

"No; the little Emperor Tsai-tien, born in 1871, and
now on the throne, is, I believe, a descendant of theirs.
He is called Kwang-su, which means 'Continuation of
glory.'"

"Does the Emperor's eldest son always reign?"

"No; the ablest or best son is generally chosen.
Ching-wang seemed to think that he was master of
the whole universe, and called himself Che-Hwang-ti,
or First Emperor; and then to try to show that he
was the founder of the monarchy, he had, as he thought,
all the historical documents burnt that could prove
otherwise, but did not succeed, for some that had been
hidden behind the walls of houses were found after his
death."

"What a quantity of stuff it must have taken to
build the wall!" said Leonard.

"Yes; the material in the Great Wall, including the
earth in the middle of it, is said to be more than enough
to surround the circumference of the earth, on two of its
great circles, with two walls of six feet high and two
feet thick. Guards are stationed in the strong towers
by which the wall is fortified; every important pass
having a strong fortress."

"And what is the height of the wall, father?" asked
Leonard.

"About twenty feet; and there are steps of brick
and stone for men on foot to ascend, and slanting places
for the cavalry."

"I shall like to see Chinese soldiers," Leonard said.
"Did you ever see them at drill, father?"



CHINESE ARTILLERY-MEN, PEKING.


"I remember very well seeing a regiment of artillery
at gun-drill one day, but I believe there has been a new
armament of Chinese artillery since my time. I suppose[28]
you know, children," then said Mr. Graham, "that
Peking ranks&mdash;&mdash;"

"For the number of its inhabitants," Sybil said
quickly, "as the second city in the world, only London
having more inhabitants, Paris about the same number."

"Yes; and it has&mdash;&mdash;"

"About two million inhabitants."

"Yes; and as Peking was built many centuries before
the Christian era, it is a very old city. The name
Peking means Court of the North. After the conquest
by the Tartars of the kingdom of Yen, of which
Peking was the capital, it became only a provincial
town, when, at the beginning of the fifteenth century,
it was again made the capital of China. The Chinese
sovereigns used to live at Nanking, but when the Tartars
had so often invaded the country, they removed to the
northern province, to enable them the more easily to
keep out the invaders."

"On our Chinese umbrella that we had in the dining-room
fireplace at home," said Sybil, "there was, I remember,
a picture of Peking, and some water was close
by it, but I cannot remember what river Peking is on."

"It is situated in a large sandy plain on the Tunghui,
a small tributary of the Peiho. This city is again divided
into the Chinese and Tartar cities, the Imperial
city, in which live the Emperor and his retainers, and
another in which the court officials have their residence.

"Like all other Chinese cities, they are surrounded
by high walls. At the north, south, east, and west sides
of towns are large folding-gates, which are often further
secured by three inner gates. The one in the south is
that of honour, through which the Emperor passes, but
which is usually kept closed at other times.[29]



CIEAN-MUN, OR CHEAN-GATE AT PEKING.
[30]

"The wall of Peking, which is sixteen miles round,
has two gates on three sides and three on the other, of
which the principal is Chean-Mun, at the south of the
Tartar city. Over the gate is a building occupied by
soldiers, who are there for purposes of defence.



CHINESE SOLDIER.




STREET OF HATA-M&Egrave;NE -TA-KIE, PEKING.


"The streets in Peking are very broad; we shall find
them much narrower in the south of China. They are
raised in the centre, and covered with a kind of stone, to
form a smooth, hard surface. In summer they are often,
I remember, very dusty, and during the rainy seasons
very dirty. At the end of each street is a wooden barrier,[32]
which is guarded day and night by soldiers. The
barrier is closed at nine o'clock at night, after which
time the Chinese are only allowed to pass through
if they have a very good reason to give for being out so
late.

"Order is well kept in the streets of Peking by
the soldiers and police, who may use their whips on
troublesome customers whenever they think it necessary
to do so.

"The principal streets, or main thoroughfares, extending
from one end of the city to the other, are its only
outlets. Trees grow in several of these streets. Houses,
in which the inhabitants live, are in smaller streets or
lanes, the houses themselves being often shut in by
walls.

"Pagodas (which, you know, are temples to heathen
gods, built in the form of towers), monasteries, and
churchyards, are all outside the walls, and the city itself
is principally kept for purposes of commerce."

"We know what pagodas are like," Leonard said,
"because we had two at home for ornaments. I think
we know many things through being so fortunate as
to have a father who has travelled."



CHINESE BARBER.


"There is a great noise in some of the streets," Mr.
Graham went on: "for instance, in the Hata-m&egrave;ne-ta-kie,
where many people are to be seen bustling about and
talking very loudly to one another. Tents are here put up
in which rice, fruit, and other things are sold, and any
one wishing for a pretty substantial meal can be supplied
with it in the Hata-m&egrave;ne-ta-kie, for before stoves stand
the vendors of such meals, who have cooked them ready
for purchasers. Other tradesmen carry hampers, slung
across their shoulders, in which they keep their goods,[33]
whilst they call out, from time to time, to let people
know what these hampers contain. Carts, horses, mules,
wheel-barrows, and sedan-chairs pass along, the whole
place seeming to be alive with buyers and sellers.[34]
The cobbler is sure to be somewhere close at hand in his
movable workshop, and first here and then there, as may
best suit himself and employers, the blacksmith pitches
his tent, which sometimes consists of a large umbrella;
whilst, again, people can refresh themselves, if they do
not care for a heavier meal, with some soup or a patty
at a soup stall.

"And the barber does not forget that he is a very
useful person. There, in the open streets, he communicates,
by the tinkling of a little bell, the fact that he is
ready to shave the heads and arrange the cues or pig-tails
of those who may require his services; and as one man
after another takes the seat that has been put ready for
him, the barber not only shaves and plaits, but also
frequently paints his customer's eyebrows and gives his
clothes a brush."

"Father, why do Chinamen wear pig-tails?" here
broke in Leonard, who, with Sybil, was very much interested
in what he heard.

"After they were conquered by the Tartars they
were obliged to wear them, to show that they were in
subjection to their conquerors; but now the pig-tail is
held in honour, and the longer it will grow the better
pleased is the Chinese gentleman who wears it. Some
very bad criminals have their tails cut off as a great
punishment and disgrace.

"Well, what should you like to hear now?" Mr.
Graham asked, after a little pause.

"What Chinese shops are like, I think," said Sybil.



A SHOP IN PEKING.



SIGN-BOARD OF A CUSHION AND MATTING MANUFACTORY.


"Most of those in China are quite open in front;
where we are going I suppose we shall see very few, if
any, shop-windows at all, but in Peking many of the
shops have glass windows. In China there are certain[36]
streets for certain shops, where the different branches of
trade have generally their own sides of the road. A
shop is called a hong. Sometimes
the master sits outside, waiting for his
customers to arrive.


"At the door of each hong are
sign-boards, upon which are painted
in gold, or coloured letters, a motto
instead of a name, and what the shop
offers for sale.

"I do not think," Mr. Graham
then said, drawing, as he spoke, a
little representation of a sign-board
out of his pocket-book, "that I ever
showed you this."

"Oh no!" both the children
answered. "And what do those
characters mean?"

On another piece of paper Mr.
Graham pointed out to them the
following interpretation:




Te&euml;n
Yee
Shun
Fung&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Poo
Seih&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tian
T&euml;en



"The three first large characters,
which form the motto, may be taken
to signify that 'Heaven favours the
prudent.' The other smaller characters designate
the nature of the business, a cushion and matting[38]
manufactory; the last character, without which no sign-board
is complete, meaning shop or factory."

"I shall like to see these sign-boards very much
when we get to China," Sybil said. "I should think they
must make the streets look very pretty."


A TWO-WHEELED CART.


Mr. Graham had illustrated several things which he
had told the children by some pictures which he had
brought on board with him.



A YOUNG FARMER AND HIS PARENTS.


Leonard was now looking again at that of Chean
Mun, or Chean Gate, for Mun means gate.

"I have been noticing, father," he then said, "that
all the carts in this picture have only two wheels."

"I never saw any in China with more," was the
answer. "Both shut and open carts (the latter being used
as carriages) have all two wheels. Those in common use
are made of wood, the body of the cart resting on an[39]
axle-tree, supported by the wheels. Horses and mules
are very little used in China, except for travelling and
for conveying luggage long distances. I remember also
noticing that horses and ponies require very little guiding
in China. Sometimes they go without reins, when
their masters will perhaps walk beside them, carrying a
whip. I have also seen very polite drivers, who, whenever
they met a friend, jumped off their carts and walked
on foot to pass one another.



A CHINESE JUNK.




FLYING KITES.


"Government servants generally use ponies, but as[40]
China is so densely populated&mdash;having, it has been
estimated, about four hundred million inhabitants, and
people find it so hard to obtain enough to support themselves
and families&mdash;they keep as few beasts of burden as[41]
possible. The farmer employs the bullock a great deal,
and in the north of China the camel is also much used.

"Much trade is carried on by boats, and where there
is no water, and farmers are without other conveyances,
they will sometimes push their wives along the roads in
wheel-barrows, sons giving their parents similar drives.
There are but few carriage-roads in many parts of China."

"I wonder the Chinese do not make more, then,"
said Leonard.

"They cannot afford to do so, because to make them
bread-producing land would have to be done away
with."

"What a number of rivers and bays there are in
China!" said Sybil, who was again examining her map.
"And I see the Great Wall crosses the Hwang-ho."

"And that's the fifth largest river in the world,"
Leonard answered. "Only the Amazon, Mississippi,
Nile, and Yantze-kiang are larger; and the Grand Canal
in China is the very largest canal in the world."

"I learnt once, too, that Hwang-ho meant 'Chinese
sorrow.' Why is it called that?"

"Because it has altered its course, which has caused
great loss and inconvenience to the Chinese."

"And what does 'Yantze-kiang' mean?"

"The son that spreads; this is their favourite river."

Geography was one of Leonard's favourite studies.

"Why do so many Chinese rivers end in ho and
kiang?" he then asked, looking over Sybil's map.

"Both words mean river&mdash;the Yantze and the
Hwang rivers. And the Chinese have all kinds of boats
for use on their rivers. Here, my boy, is a picture of a
Chinese junk. Look at it well, and see if you can discover
anything peculiar about it."[42]

Leonard looked for some time. "It has sails," he
answered, "like butterflies' wings."

"Yes; that is how the Chinese make many of their
sails."

"But the kites are what I want to see so much," said
Leonard, as though the sails had reminded him of them
again. "What are the most peculiar of them like?"

"Like birds, insects, animals, clusters of birds, gods
on clouds: all kinds of things, in fact, are represented by
these kites, which the Chinese are most clever in making,
and also in flying. I have seen old men, of about seventy
years of age, thoroughly enjoying flying their kites. The
Chinese do not care much for your, and my, favourite
games, Leonard: cricket and football."

"What games do they like?"

"They are very fond of battledore and shuttlecock,
but instead of using a battledore they hit the shuttlecock
with their heads, elbows, or feet. Seven or eight
children play together, and nearly always aim the shuttlecock
rightly. Girls play at this game too, in spite of
their small feet. Tops, balls, see-saws, and quoits are
also favourite toys and games amongst the Chinese."

"I remember," Sybil said, "a girl at school having
a Chinese shuttlecock, and that was like a bird."

"Well, father, go on, please. What other amusements
have they?" asked Leonard.

"Puppet-shows for one thing I remember, which
they exhibit in the streets, as we do 'Punch and
Judy.' The pictures in these shows are exhibited by
means of strings, which are either worked from behind
or from above the stand, and as the people look through
a glass, the views are displayed to them. A man
standing at the side calls out loudly, and beats a little[43]
gong to summon people to attend the show. And now
I think, as I am rather tired for to-day, I shall beat a
little gong to dismiss you from the show," Mr. Graham
said, smiling, as he turned towards his children, who
never seemed to grow tired of listening.

"Very well, father; we will go now, and let you rest,"
Sybil replied, standing up. "Thank you so much.
To-morrow, you know, we shall come to the show again,
so please remember to sound the gong in good time."
And off they bounded, leaving Mr. Graham at liberty
to go and seek his wife, who was then lying down in her
cabin.



[44]







CHAPTER III.

THE RELIGIONS OF CHINA.




LI-HUNG.




ILL you please
tell us to-day,
father, something
about the religion
of the Chinese? I know
they worship idols, but
how do they believe in
them?" Sybil asked, as
soon as their "Peep-show,"
as the children
continued to call their
father's stories, began the
next afternoon. During the morning she had sat and
read to her mother, who still felt the motion of the
vessel very much, and had therefore to lie down part of
the day.

"I will try to do so," was the answer; "but I think
what you hear may puzzle you a good deal, for they have
very strange creeds."

"Did grandfather make many converts?"[45]

"Very few indeed; but then he was one of our very
first missionaries to Peking, so was most thankful for
the very little which he was enabled to do.



A CITIZEN OF TIENT-SIN.


"I remember two men for whose conversion from
Buddhism he often gave thanks. One was a citizen of
Tientsin, where we landed on our way to the capital.[46]

"This good fellow, who was then a very questionable
character, was smoking his pipe in a most indifferent
manner, when my father, through his teacher, first addressed
him. Missionaries in China, you know, have
teachers of the dialects."

"Shall you have one?"

"Of course. Well, this man would not listen at all
at first, and was very angry at my father's interference;
but after a while we met him again at Peking, and in
time both he and his wife learnt to believe, and to long
for Christian baptism, before receiving which they not
only left off worshipping their family idols, but even
destroyed them. A short time ago I heard that this
man had become a native lay teacher, and was a
great help to the mission, as he could, of course,
always make himself understood to his own countrymen,
who were also not unlikely to be won by his
example."

"What was his name?" asked Leonard.

"Tung-Sean."

"And that of the other convert?"

"Li-Hung. He was a much older man, and was
sitting, I remember, the day we first saw him, in a field,
resting from his work, and as he caught sight of my
father he began to call him all sorts of names, amongst
which was to be heard very often that of 'foreign devil.'
I believe he even looked for stones to throw at us.
Your grandfather&mdash;always a very quiet, self-possessed
man&mdash;just dropped some tracts at his side, translated into
Chinese. We often saw Li-Hung again, and though he
gave us much trouble, a month before my father died he
had the happiness also of witnessing this man's conversion
to the true faith."[47]

"Grandfather must have been very pleased," Sybil
said.

"He was; but I think now I have something rather
interesting to tell you of our journey from Tientsin to
Peking. We went in carts drawn by two mules, one in
front of the other, and at night we slept at inns, where,
I think, you would like to hear about our sleeping accommodation.
It was winter, and as the Peking winter
is cold, people there, to make themselves warm at night,
sleep on kangs. As these were different at both inns to
which we went, I will tell you about both.



A KANG.


"In one the kang consisted of a platform built of
brick, so much larger than a bed that several people could
sleep on it at once. A kind of tunnel passed through the
platform, which had a chimney at one end, whilst at the
other end, a little while before bed-time, a small quantity
of dry fuel was set on fire, when the flame passed
through the tunnel and out of the chimney. In this
way the kang was warmed, when felt matting was put
upon it. Here we lay down, and were covered over
with a kind of cotton-wool counterpane.[48]



BOATS ON THE RIVER PEI-HO AT TIENT-SIN.
[49]

"The kang in the other inn was warmed by a little
stove from underneath, which also served in the day-time
for cooking purposes, when the bed-clothes were
removed from the kang, on which mats, and even little
tables, were also sometimes put, until it became a sofa; so
it was very useful."

The children laughed.

"We are not hearing about the religion yet, though,"
Sybil said.

"Oh, do let us hear just a little more about Peking
and Tientsin first," Leonard answered. "How far is
Tientsin from the capital?"

"Eighty miles. And do you know what river it is
on?"

Leonard considered. "It must be an important
one, I should think, as it carries things, doesn't it, from
the sea-coast to near to Peking?"

"It is only a river of secondary importance, but the
principal one of the province of Pe-chili. Now for its
name." Sybil referred to her map.

"The Pei-ho, of course," they exclaimed together.
"And I suppose there is ever so much traffic on it?"
Leonard said; "with no end of ships to be seen?"

"Yes, a good many may be seen there. I have a
picture of boats on the River Pei-ho."

"What sort of flags do Chinese boats have, father?
I do not see any hoisted here."

"The Imperial Navy is divided into river and sea-going
vessels, the former consisting of 1,900 ships, the
latter of 918; and there are 188,000 sailors. Ships in the
Imperial Navy generally fly a flag at the main, on which
red lines are drawn, or sometimes a tri-colour is hoisted
there instead. Red would, I suppose, be for safety, as[50]
this is the 'lucky' colour of the Chinese. At the stern
of the vessel I remember seeing the name of the official
who directs and superintends the ship."

"Isn't Tientsin noted for something?" Sybil then
asked.



MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS.


"Yes; for the treaty of June 26th, 1858, between the
Chinese and British, some of the terms of which were that
the Christian religion should be protected by Chinese
authorities, that British subjects should be allowed to
travel in the country for pleasure or business, under
passports issued by their consul, and that the Queen
might acquire a building site at Peking."

"But now the religion, please, father," she said
again.[51]

"Very well; but you must pay great attention to what
I say, or you will not understand. Most of the Chinese
are either Confucianists, Buddhists, or Taouists, although
there are also Jews and Mahometans amongst
them. At one time it is supposed that the people of
China had really a knowledge of the true God, and
that when they worshipped, in much the same sort of
manner as did the patriarchs, Him whom they call
Wang-teen, or Shang-ti, which means Supreme Ruler,
they worshipped God.

"But mixing with this an idolatrous worship of
departed ancestors, they nearly lost sight of the Supreme
Ruler, the jealous God, Who, we know, claims all our
worship.

"About the latter half of the sixth century before
Christ, Confucius, a great and clever philosopher of
China, who was born 551 b.c., wrote and put together
books that held very moral and good maxims, afterwards
called 'The Classics.'

"He taught that men must always be obedient to
those to whom they are in subjection: people to prince,
child to parent, filial piety being enforced before every
other duty. He was very anxious to improve the
manners of the people; but women he ranked very
low. Confucianism is&mdash;but perhaps you will not understand
this&mdash;more a philosophy than a religion. Its
followers have no particular form of worship, and no
priesthood. The Pearly Emperor, Supreme Ruler, is
their deity, but worship is seldom offered to him, and
then only by a few.

"Although Confucius disapproved very much of idols,
after he was dead many of his followers worshipped
him.[52]



A MANDARIN.


"Confucianists do not believe in a future state of
rewards and punishments, but think that their good
and bad deeds will be rewarded here by riches or
poverty, long or short life, good or bad health. Conscience[53]
is to lead people aright, and tell them when they
do wrong.

"The high mandarins and literary people are
generally Confucianists; school-boys also worship an idol
or tablet of the sage, in which his spirit is supposed
to dwell.

"There is a temple to the honour of 'The Great
Teacher' in every large town; and on great occasions,
and always in spring-time and autumn, sacrifices are
here offered, the Emperor himself, as high priest, presiding
at these two ceremonies in Peking, the chief
mandarins of his court giving him assistance. In
temples of Confucius idols are very seldom to be seen.

"The Confucianists are taught that man was originally
good, his nature being given by heaven, and that sin
came through union of the soul with matter."

"What are mandarins, please, father?" asked
Leonard.

"Chinese officials, of which there are many grades,
and many in each grade, all of whom are paid by
Government. To every province there is a viceroy, to
every city a governor, and to the village a mandarin, who
is elected to rule over it for three years; and all these,
again, have many officers under them. There are also a
great many military mandarins. A great mark of
imperial favour is to allow mandarins, civil or military,
to wear a peacock's feather in their caps, which hangs
down over the back, and the ball placed on the top
shows, by its colour and material, the rank of the wearer.
Soldiers fighting very bravely are often buoyed up with
the hope of receiving one of these feathers.

"Mandarins, who stand in a sort of fatherly relationship
towards their people, although they do not always[54]
behave like fathers towards them, look for implicit
obedience from them."

"Can a mandarin be punished when he does
wrong?" Leonard asked. "And what sort of dress does
he wear?"



A MANDARIN WITH PEACOCK&#39;S FEATHER.


"He can be punished when he does wrong; and as well
as I can remember, those mandarins that I saw, who
were in high office, wore a long, loose robe of blue
silk, embroidered with gold threads. This reached to
their ankles, being fastened round their waists with a
belt. Over this was a violet tunic, coming just below
the knees, which had very wide, long sleeves, usually
worn turned back, but if not, hanging over the hands."[55]

"Will you please go on about the religion now,
father?" Sybil then said. "You had just told us that
the Confucianists were taught that man was made
good."

"Yes; and their worship is paid almost entirely to
their ancestors, which worship they look upon as a continuation
of the reverence they had been taught to show
them while on earth. I will tell you more about ancestral
worship presently.

"Many people, as you can well understand, were not
satisfied with Confucianism as a religion, as it could
not satisfy their spiritual wants, especially as the Pearly
Emperor, or Supreme Ruler, generally looked upon as the
highest divinity worshipped by the Chinese, might
only be approached by the Emperor and his court;
so another sect sprang up, having a philosopher
named La-outze, who was born 604 b.c., for its
founder. He thought that to grow perfect he must
seclude himself from other people, and in his retirement
was always looking for the Taou-le, the meaning of which
you will hardly understand&mdash;the cause or the end of
all things. His followers are called Taouists. This
philosopher says in his book that 'it is by stillness, and
contemplation, and union with Taou, that virtue is to be
achieved'&mdash;Taou here meaning a principle and a way.
He said that virtue consisted in losing sight of oneself,
and that man should love even his enemies, and go
through life as if none of his possessions belonged to
himself. The Taouists say that 'Taou is without substance,
and eternal, and the universe coming from him exists in
the silent presence of Taou everywhere,' and that only
those who become very virtuous are happy.

"La-outze is now worshipped by the Taouists as the[56]
third of a trinity of persons, called 'The Three Pure
Ones.'

"He is said, when born, to have had long white hair,
and is therefore represented as an old man, and called
'old boy.' The Chinese assert that his mother was fed
with food from heaven, and that when he was born he
jumped up into the air, and said, as he pointed with his left
hand to heaven and his right hand to the earth, 'Heaven
above, earth beneath: only Taou is honourable.' The
Taouist trinity are supposed to live in the highest heaven;
and Taouists used to spend a great deal of time in seeking
for a drink that they thought would make them live
for ever. Subduing evil is by some of them supposed
to secure immortality to the soul.

"Their priests are often very ignorant men, but
they are believed in by the people, and are employed
by them to perform superstitious rites."

"Oh, father! Isn't it a dreadful pity that they
should believe so many things like Christians, even in
a trinity, and the duty of loving one's enemies, and only
be heathens after all?"

"It is indeed; but the more we see of heathens,
Sybil, the more we shall notice how they cannot help
feeling after truth and grasping some parts of it, which
seem as though they were a very necessity to religion.
These Taouist priests are often called in by the people
to exorcise, or drive away, evil spirits, to cure sick people
and commune with the dead."

"Oh, father! I do so like this Peep-show. Please
tell us now about the people of the other sect."



A BUDDHIST PRIEST.


"They are the Buddhists, who also worship a
trinity; indeed, Taouists are thought to have taken
that idea from them. As early as 250 b.c. Buddhist[58]
missionaries came over from India to China, but the
religion did not really take root until an emperor named
Hing, of the Han dynasty, introduced it, in the first century
of the Christian era, about 66 a.d. This emperor
is said to have seen in a dream, in the year of our Lord
61, an image of a foreign god coming into his palace,
and in consequence he was advised to adopt the religion of
Buddha, when he sent to India for an idol and some
priests. Towards the end of the thirteenth century
there were more than 4,200 Buddhist temples in China,
and more than 213,000 monks. The Buddhist trinity
is called Pihte, or the Three Precious Ones: Buddha Past,
Buddha Present, and Buddha Future, and dreadfully ugly
idols they are. The Buddhist's idea of heaven is Nirv&acirc;na,
or rest, or more properly speaking, extinction. The
Chinese Buddhist thinks that a man possesses three souls or
spirits, one of which accompanies the body to the grave,
another passes into his ancestral tablet to be worshipped,
and the third enters into one, or all, of the ten kingdoms
of the Buddhistic hell, into which people pass after death,
there to receive punishments according to the lives they
have led upon earth. From the tenth kingdom they
pass back to earth, to inhabit the form of a man, beast,
bird, or insect, as they may have deserved, unless during
life a man has attained to a certain state of perfection,
when he mounts to the highest heaven, and perhaps
becomes a god or buddha. But even from the Western
Paradise a spirit has sometimes to return to earth.
Should a man have been good in all the various lives
that he has lived, he is supposed to attain, I believe, to
this Nirv&acirc;na, or extinction."

"What a wonderful belief!" Sybil said. "So they
cannot believe at all in the immortality of the soul?"[59]

"No, they do not."

"I should like to see a Buddhist priest very much,"
Leonard said.



ENTRANCE TO A BUDDHIST MONASTERY.


"I dare say you will see a good many when you get
to China. They live together in monasteries, sometimes
in great numbers, and these monasteries are prettily
situated, surrounded by lakes and gardens. They consist
of a number of small buildings, to the principal of
which is a large entrance, that has inscriptions on either
side of the gateway."[60]



A MONASTERY.
[61]

"Are the priests very good men?" asked Leonard.



A GONG.


"Very often, I am afraid, just the reverse; but this
is not to be wondered at, for criminals in China, to escape
from justice, will sometimes shave their heads, and seek refuge
by becoming Buddhist priests. When they take their
vows&mdash;some taking nine, some twelve&mdash;for each one a cut
is made in their arms to help them to remember it. Some
of the vows resemble the commandments setting forth
our duty towards our neighbour. A Buddhist priest, in
China, wears a wide turn-over collar; when he officiates
he often dresses in a yellow robe made of silk or cotton,[62]
but he is only allowed to wear silk when he does
officiate. At other times his garments are of white or
ash colour, or he wears a long, grey cowl with flowing
sleeves. Buddhist priests shave all their hair two or
three times a month. They think it is of great use to
repeat their classics very often to the gods, and keep an
account of the number of times they say them on their
beads. I fancy they use brooms wherewith to sprinkle
holy water. There are four special commandments for
Buddhists, both priests and people: not to destroy animal
life, not to steal, not to speak falsely, and not to drink
wine. In monasteries the refectories of the priests are
very large, and they have all to sit at dinner, so that
the abbot, who is at their head, can see their faces.
They are called to breakfast and dinner by a gong,
where they have to appear in their cowls. Gongs are
very much used in China, and are to be seen at all the
temples. When the priest, who presides, comes in, they
all rise, and putting their hands together, say grace.
After the food has been so blessed, some is put outside
as an offering to the fowls of the air. During dinner
the priests may not speak, and on the walls of the
refectory are boards, on which are written warnings,
such as not to eat too quickly; also the rules of the
monastery."

"That would not have done for you, Leonard, when
you thought you would be late for school, and gobbled
your dinner anyhow," said Sybil.

"How many gods have the Chinese?" asked
Leonard.



WORSHIP IN A LAMASARY, BUDDHIST TEMPLE.


"So many that it would be impossible to say, and
the Celestials (as the Chinese are often called, from
naming their country the Celestial Land) are not[64]
particular how they worship them; Taouists, for instance,
worshipping those who are peculiarly Buddhist divinities,
and Buddhists invoking, in return, their gods. Indeed,
the three religions have so borrowed from one another,
and people have believed so much as they liked, that
the Chinese themselves often do not know to which
religion they belong, and are either all or none, pretty
well as they choose. The Buddhism of China is not
at all the pure Buddhism, and has been much corrupted
by its professors."

"Who was the founder of Buddhism?"

"An Indian prince, of beautiful character, born
620 b.c., and called Sh&acirc;kyamuni Buddha, who left
wealth and luxury to go about relieving suffering
wherever he found it. After he died his followers
believed that he was transformed into a god, having
three different forms."

"Tell us some of the gods, please."

"A god of rain; a god of wind; a god of thunder;
a god of wealth, the latter worshipped very much by
tradesmen; a god of thieves; a goddess of thunder; a
guardian goddess of women and little children, called
Kum-fa, whose ten attendants watch over children, helping
them to eat, and teaching them to smile and walk;
a god of wine; a god of fire; a goddess of mercy; a
goddess of sailors; a goddess of children, called 'Mother';
a god of the kitchen; a god of measles, a god of small-pox.
Then the Confucianists worship two stars, who
are supposed to look after literature and drawing, the
former called the god of literature. And besides household
gods belonging to every family, there are a god of
the passing year, and numerous others. Many of the
gods are deified persons who once lived on earth."[65]



TEMPLE OF THE MOON, PEKING.
[66]

"What a number!" Sybil said. "But who, then, is
the great Lama? You have not told us anything about
him yet, and I heard you speaking about him the other
day."

"There is another form of Buddhism, called Lamaism,
and this, though it prevails principally in Thibet and
Mongolia, has also its followers in Peking. The Great
Lama, or Living Buddha, is the head of this."

"And he is a living man?"

"Yes; but his soul is said never to die; therefore,
when he dies it is supposed to pass into an infant whom
the priests select by a likeness that they trace to the late
Lama. I one day saw worship going on in a Lama
temple."

"Have you a picture of it, father?" Leonard asked,
who was getting a little tired of these descriptions, which
Sybil liked so much.

"Yes, and I think it a very good one. In the centre,
facing the worshippers, is a very large idol indeed of
Buddha. To the right and left of the temple are smaller
idols. Some gods in temples do not receive worship, but
guard the doors. Incense is burning in front; the high
priest, to the right, is lifting up his hands in adoration,
whilst the people offer scented rods and tapers to
Buddha. As they light their offerings they kow-tow,
or hit their heads upon the floor. This is the Chinese
way of reverent, respectful salutation. The devotees
are grouped in squares.

"Then I forgot to tell you that the Sun and Moon are
also worshipped. Whilst in Peking, I went to a temple
of the Moon. It was on the day of the autumnal equinox,
when, at six o'clock in the evening, a very solemn sacrifice
is offered, and the great ladies of the capital meet[67]
to burn their tapers. I approached this temple by a long
avenue of beautiful trees. The temple was large; but I
noticed that more women than men had come to attend
the ceremonies."

"I thought the Chinese were clever people," Sybil
said; "if so, how can they believe in so many gods?"

"They have been trained to do so. They feel, I
suppose, that they must offer worship, and until a real
knowledge of the true God can be planted in their midst,
they will remain slaves to idolatry. Many of the more
enlightened heathen, I believe, only regard their idols
as representations of the Deity they are feeling after,
and not really as the Deity Himself; although I fear
many of the simpler sort, in different degrees, regard
their idols with great religious awe. Then, many a
Chinaman, again, will so often seem to have no religion
at all!"

"Is it very difficult to teach the Chinese, father?"

"It is very difficult to find words, in their language,
clearly to bring home to them the great truths of the
Bible; and Confucius having for nearly twenty centuries
held such a sway over their minds, they do not care to
listen to new teachers."

"I am so glad the Bible is now translated into
Chinese, and that you are taking some copies out with
you. But how old these people must be!"

"The Chinese are a very ancient race, and had a
literature 700 years before Christ. They are very fond
and proud of their country."

"Do Taouists and Buddhists believe in, and read, the
writings of Confucius?"

"To a great extent."

"And are there many Christians in China now?"[68]

"The Church Missionary Society, at her six chief
stations of Hong-Kong, Foo-Chow, Ningpo, Hang-Chow,
Shaou-hing, and Shanghai, now numbers 4,667
native followers, and 1,702 communicants, of whom
nine are native clergymen and 174 native Christian
teachers. In China altogether there are 40,000 Christian
adherents. But what are these, when we think
that this vast empire alone contains 400,000,000 people,
one-third of the human race?"

"They will listen to you, father," Sybil said, looking
up very brightly. Sybil was a child who thought that
there was nobody, except her own mother, in the whole
world to compare with her father.





[69]











CHAPTER IV.

CHINESE CHILDHOOD.




&nbsp; &nbsp; FORGOT to ask you, father,"
Leonard said, about a week
later&mdash;for during that time
he and his sister had been otherwise
engaged, and had therefore not come to hear
anything more about the Chinese and their strange
doings&mdash;"I forgot to ask you if Celestial boys wore pig-tails
too. I have never, I believe, seen a picture of a
Chinese boy."

"Some have pig-tails, but some parents allow just a
tuft of hair to grow on a boy's head until he is eight or
ten years old, and shave the rest. Sometimes he wears
the tuft longer; and I have also seen girls wearing it
on one or both sides of their heads."

"Father, will you tell us something now about
the children?" Sybil then asked.

"I know little babies of three days old often have
their wrists tied with red cotton cord, to which a charm
is hung, which is, I suppose, to bring it prosperity or drive
away from it evil spirits. At a month old its head is
shaved for the first time, when, if its mother does not
shave it, a hair-dresser has to wear red in which to do it.[70]
A boy is shaved before the ancestral tablet, but a girl
before an image of the goddess of children called
'Mother,' and thank-offerings are on this day presented
to the goddess."

"What does the ancestral tablet mean?"

"It consists of a piece of wood or stone, which is
meant to represent the dead. As I told you, one of the
spirits of a dead man is supposed to enter the tablet, and
the more this is worshipped the happier the spirit is supposed
to be. On this tablet are names and inscriptions,
which sometimes represent several ancestors. After a
certain time (I think the fifth generation) the tablet is
no longer worshipped, as by that time the spirit is supposed
to have passed into another body."

"Thank you. I understand that now," Sybil said.
"Does anything else happen on the grand shaving
day?"

"Presents of painted ducks' eggs, cakes, and other
things are sent to the baby, and when it is four months
old 'Mother' is thanked again, and prayed to make
the child grow fast, sleep well, and be good-tempered."
Sybil and Leonard laughed. "On this day the
child also sits for the first time in a chair, when his
grandmother, his mother's mother, who has to give him
a great many presents, sends him some soft kind of
sugar-candy, which is put upon the chair, and when this
has stuck the baby is put upon it, and I suppose his
clothes then stick to it also."

"What a fashion to learn to sit in a chair!" Leonard
said. "And what's done on his first birthday?"

"Another thank-offering is presented to 'Mother,'
more presents come, and the baby has to sit in front of a
number of things, such as ink, pens, scales, pencils, tools,[71]
books, fruit, gold, or anything the parents like to arrange
before him, and whatever he catches hold of first will
show them what his future character or occupation is
likely to be.



YUEN-SHUH, A LITTLE STUDENT.


"But the worst part has now to come. As soon as
the poor little fellow can learn anything, he is taught to
worship 'Mother' and other idols, before which he has
to bow down, and raise up his little hands, whilst candles
and incense are burnt in their honour. So it is no wonder
that as he grows older he learns his lesson thoroughly.
At sixteen children are supposed to leave childhood behind
them, and there is a ceremony for this."[72]

"Do Chinese girls learn lessons? or is it only the
boys?"

"In some parts of China there are, I believe, a few
schools for young ladies, and instruction is given to
them by tutors at home; but although two or three
Chinese ladies have been celebrated for great literary
attainments, these are quite the exceptions, and there
are only a very few schools for any girls in China,
except the mission schools. Those for boys abound all
over the country."

"Did you ever go into a boy's school, father?"

"Yes, into several, where I saw many a little
intelligent-looking boy working very hard at his lessons.
One little boy, named Yuen-Shuh, told me that he
meant to get all the literary honours that he could.
Chinese boys are not allowed to talk at all in school-hours.
Each boy has a desk at which to sit, which
is so arranged that he cannot speak to the boy next to
him. Little Yuen-Shuh had been to school since he
was six years old.

"Another boy was saying a lesson when I went in,
and therefore standing with his back to his teacher.
Boys always say their lessons like this, and it is called
'backing the book.' The teacher, as they repeat their
lessons, puts down their marks. When learning their
lessons they repeat them aloud. There are higher schools
into which older boys pass, and the great aim of the
Chinese is to take literary honours, as nothing else can
give them a position of high rank; but even a peasant
taking these honours would rank as a gentleman."

"Will you take me to see a school in China?"
Leonard then asked.



A CHINESE SCHOOL.


His father, having promised to do so, went on[74]
to say to Leonard: "Parents are very particular as to
their choice of a schoolmaster, who must be considered
good, as well as able to teach; and to qualify himself
the master must, of course, know the doctrines of
the ancient sages. After all has been settled for a
boy to go to school, the parents always invite the
schoolmaster to a dinner, given expressly for him.
Then a fortune-teller is asked to decide upon a 'lucky'
day for the boy to make his first appearance at school,
when he takes the tutor a present. No boy ever goes
to school first on the anniversary of the day on which
Confucius died or was buried. On entering school, he
turns to the shrine of Confucius&mdash;an altar erected to
his honour in every school&mdash;and worships him, after
which he salutes his teacher very respectfully, hears
what he has to do, and goes to his desk."

"And are there many holidays at Chinese schools?"

"At the new year and in the autumn there are
always holidays, but children also go home to keep all
religious festivals, to celebrate the birthdays of parents
and grandparents, to worship their tablets, and at the
tombs of ancestors. Very often schoolmasters are men
who have toiled very hard at their books, and yet have
not succeeded in taking a very high degree, but
sometimes having done so, they choose teaching for
their profession. Children are very much punished in
China when they break school-rules. Perhaps the
punishment they fear most is to be beaten with a
broom, because they think that this may make them
unlucky for the rest of their lives."

"And they can never have an alphabet to learn,"
Sybil said, "when they first go to school, as there is not
one."[75]



A VILLAGE SCHOOLMASTER.
[76]

"No; instead of letters and words, they have to learn,
and master, characters. In some schools children learn
names first; in others they have reading lessons, where
all the sentences consist of three characters. As soon
as possible they are set to learn the classic on 'Filial
Piety.'"

"Now, father, will you please describe a Chinese
house to us?"

"Those of the richer classes are surrounded by a
high wall, and composed of a number of rooms, generally
on one floor. In large cities some houses have another
storey; but the Chinese think it 'unlucky' to live above
ground."

"The Chinese seem to think everything either lucky
or unlucky," Sybil said; "it does seem silly. I do not
wonder that you always told me not to say that word.
I don't think I shall ever want to say it again now; and
I used to say it rather often, usen't I? But I did not
mean to interrupt you, so please go on now."

"Some houses are very large, which they have to be,
in order to accommodate several branches of the same
family, who often live together in different parts of
them.

"There are generally three doors of entrance to a
house, of which the principal, in the centre, leads to the
reception hall, into which visitors are shown. I have
seen the walls of rooms hung with white silk or
satin, on which sentences of good advice were written.
All sorts of beautiful lanterns hang from the sitting-room
ceilings, sometimes by silk cords. The furniture consists
principally of chairs, tables, pretty screens and cabinets,
with many porcelain ornaments, and fans are very
numerous in a Chinese household. Most houses have[77]
very beautiful gardens; even the poor try to have their
houses surrounded by as much ground as possible. Many
houses also have verandahs, where the Chinaman likes to
smoke his evening pipe. Indeed, women, even ladies,
smoke pipes in China. I have a picture of a verandah
scene in the south of China."

"Are these people rich or poor?" Sybil asked.

"Certainly not rich, but also not very poor."

"You were saying the other day, father, that
Chinese people smoke something else besides tobacco?"
Leonard then asked.

"Opium."

"What is opium?"

"The juice of the poppy, which, after being made
into a solid form, is boiled down with water."

"Why did you say that opium-smoking was so
dreadful?"

"You shall hear all about it, and then judge for yourself.
The opium-smoker, whilst engaged with his pipe,
thinks of, and cares for, nothing else in the whole world
besides, and generally lies down to give himself up to
its more full enjoyment. Holding his pipe over the
flame of a small oil-lamp beside him, he lights the opium,
and then gently draws in the vapour which proceeds
from it. Sometimes people smoke in their own houses,
and sometimes they resort to horrid places regularly set
apart for opium-smoking. In Hong-Kong, where we are
going, there will be many an opium-smoker who will
buy this drug in quantities when he cannot even afford
to purchase clothing.



FAMILY SCENE&mdash;AFTER DINNER


"If a man make a practice of smoking opium at
stated times, even should these times not be very frequent,
he so acquires the habit of smoking, that if, when the[79]
pipe be due it is not forthcoming, he is quite unable to do
his work, and wastes all his time thinking of and longing
for his pipe. The habit is sometimes acquired in less
than a fortnight. Opium may first be taken in a small
quantity to cure toothache; the small quantity leads to
large quantities; the large quantities, or even small ones
taken regularly, lead at last to the man becoming an
habitual opium-smoker: and this means that the victim's
health becomes injured, and that he is unfit for any
work. If he then leave off his opium, he becomes ill, has
dreadful pain, which sometimes lasts till he smokes again;
he has no appetite for food, cannot sleep at night, and
looks haggard and miserable. Sometimes if opium cannot be procured
by him he dies.

"And these men make themselves slaves for life to
this horrid drug, knowing before they touch it what it
will do for them.

"Opium-smoking makes rich men poor, honest men
thieves, and poor people even sell their children to obtain
the drug."

"And can't they be cured, father?" Sybil asked.

"Medical aid has been brought in to help them,
but it generally fails; and every now and then we hear
of an opium-smoker becoming a Christian and then overcoming
the vice, but this is also very rare indeed. And
what does this teach us, children?"

They thought. "Never to acquire bad habits, I suppose,"
said Sybil, "for fear they should grow upon
us."



HABITUAL OPIUM-SMOKERS.


"Yes; and because they do grow upon us. Everything
to which we very much accustom ourselves grows
into a habit; therefore it is so very important for
both Chinese and English, for both grown-up and little[81]
people, to cultivate good habits. And more especially is
this important in the case of young people, because so
many of our habits, which remain with us and influence
our whole after-life, are formed in our childish days."

"And do people really sell their children?"

"They do, indeed; and some children are so filial
that they will even sell themselves for the good of their
parents. There is very little that a Chinaman will not
do for a parent. One of their superstitions is that if a
father or mother be ill, and the child should cut away
some of its own flesh to mix in the parent's medicine, a
cure would be effected; and children have been known
to cut pieces, for this purpose, out of their own arms."

"What would happen," Sybil asked, "if a child were
to do anything very dreadful to a parent in China?"

"If a son kill a parent, he is put to death, his
house is torn down, his nearest neighbours are punished,
and his schoolmaster is put to death; the magistrate of the
district would also suffer, and the governor of the province
would go down in rank."

"How unfair!" Leonard exclaimed, "when only
one person did it."

"Why does all that happen?" Sybil asked.

"To show how great the man's sin is. The schoolmaster
is punished because it is thought that he did not
bring up his pupil properly. Of course, it is very unfair,
but the Chinese are often very cruel in their
chastisments, and many criminals prefer death to some of
the other punishments. A great many also suffer capital
punishment; sometimes as many as ten thousand people
in a year."

"Then, when children do wrong, their parents and
schoolmasters are blamed?"[82]

"Very often their faults are attributed to their
bringing-up."

"Oh! oughtn't we to be careful, then, Leonard?
Fancy when we do wrong people blaming father or
mother!"

Leonard was then very anxious to hear more about
Chinese punishments, so his father told him an occurrence
that he had once witnessed.

"A very usual way of punishing small offences," he
began, "is by beating with a bamboo; and whenever
a mandarin finds that any one, under his jurisdiction, has
transgressed, he can use the bamboo. Parents use it on
their children even when they are thirty years of age.
The poor Chinese culprits used to be subject to very
horrible tortures, such as having their fingers or ankles
squeezed until they made confession; but I believe
a good many of the worst tortures have now been done
away with. One in common use is the canque, which
is a collar made of heavy wood, with a hole in the centre
for the head to come through. It is fastened round the
neck, and is worn from one to three months, preventing its
prisoner from lying down day or night. The captive
remains in the street instead of in prison, and is dependent
upon his friends to feed him."

"What a shame!" Leonard said. "I'd like to be a
magistrate in China, to put that sort of cruelty down."



A CHINESE COURT OF LAW.




CHINESE PUNISHMENT.


"But now I am coming to a trial that I witnessed
myself. I remember, as I went into the Provincial
Criminal Court, one day, seeing the judge sitting
behind a large table, covered with a red cloth. Secretaries,
interpreters, and turnkeys stood at each end
of the table, only the judge having a right to sit down.
Soon after I arrived the prisoner was led in by a chain[84]
who immediately threw himself down on the ground
before the judge. The crime brought against him was
robbing an official of high rank. It was thought that
he could not have committed the robbery alone, and was
asked how it was effected, and who were his accomplices.
He would not say. Then he was beaten; but still this
brought no answer. Both an arm and a leg were then
put into a board, which made it almost impossible for
him either to walk, or sit, or stand. His poor back must
have ached terribly; and while one man dragged him[85]
along by a chain, another held a whip to urge him
forward.

"And he had never committed the robbery after all,
but gave himself up in place of his father, a man named
Wang-Yangsui, who was really the culprit."

Tears were in Sybil's eyes as she listened.



POOR OLD WANG-YANGSUI IN THE CAGE.


"And he suffered all that?" she said.

"Sons have been known to allow themselves to be
transported to save their parents, and then only to have
felt that they did their duty."

"And in this case was the real culprit ever found
out?"[86]

"Yes; the father, moved with compassion for his
boy, gave himself up."

"And did they not let him off," Leonard asked, "as
the son had suffered so much for him?"

"No; they put him into a cage in which were holes
for his head and feet, but in which he could neither sit
down nor stand upright. Round the cage was an inscription
relating the nature of his crime."

"How long was he left there?"

"That I was not able to hear, but the day he was
incarcerated I saw his daughter feeding him with chop-sticks.
These, which consist of two sticks that people
hold in the same hand wherewith to feed themselves,
instead of knives and forks, the Chinese always use when
they eat. She must have found it difficult to get to
him, as she was carrying a basket, as well as a baby on her
back, for she had small feet, and women with small feet
cannot walk any distance, even without a load at all. It
is not the rule for lower class girls to have their feet
made small, though in some cases it is done. This
woman had once been better off."

"Why do Chinese ladies have small feet?" Leonard
asked.

"But, father," Sybil put in, "please tell us first
what became of that poor old man. I am so sorry he
stole."

"I heard that great poverty had tempted him to do
so, but that he afterwards bitterly repented of the crime
which he had committed. How long he remained in the
cage I was never able to ascertain; but I really think
now that we must close our 'Peep-show' for to-day."

"After we've heard about the small feet ladies,
father. I think you have just time for that."[87]

"The feet of Chinese women would be no smaller
than, perhaps not as small as, other women's feet, were
they not compressed."

"What does that mean?"

"Made smaller by being pressed."

"How painful it must be!"

"So it is. When very young, a little girl's foot is
tightly bandaged round, the end of the bandage being first
laid on the inside of the foot, then carried round the toes,
under the foot, and round the heel till the toes are
drawn over the sole, in which an indentation becomes
made and the instep swells out. After a time the
foot is soaked in hot water, when some of the toes will
occasionally drop off. Every time the bandage is taken
away another is put on, and tied more tightly. For the
first year there is, as we can imagine, dreadful pain,
but after two years the foot will become dead and cease
to ache. You can therefore understand that it is very
uncomfortable for Chinese ladies to walk, and if they
go any distance they are carried on the backs of their
female slaves."

"Are all Chinese parents so silly as to have their
little girls' feet bandaged?"

"A few are strong-minded enough to break through
the rule, and all the Tartar ladies have natural feet.
Anti-foot-binding societies have now been formed by
the Chinese gentry in Canton and Amoy."

"I wonder what made people first think of doing
this?" Sybil said.

"Some people think that it was first done to
help husbands to keep their wives at home; others
say that it was to copy an Empress who had a deformed
foot which she bandaged; but whatever the[88]
reason may have been, we cannot but wish very, very
strongly, that the cruel custom might be soon completely
done away with!"

"I shall like to see the ladies being carried on their
slaves' backs," Leonard said. "That will be fun!"

"You will soon see it now," was his father's answer,
"for we have been six weeks at sea, and the captain says
we may expect to be at Shanghai in another ten days'
time, so I think I had better not tell you any more, and
let you find out the rest for yourselves."

"I think we might have just one more 'Peep-show,'"
Sybil replied, "and hear how we get our tea-leaves.
I think we ought to know about that before we
arrive."

The missionary smiled, and the next time his children
wanted a "Peep-show" very much, only a very little
persuasion was required to make him sit down between
them and let them have it.




[89]








CHAPTER V.

THE MERCHANT SHOWMAN.








ELL, so it is to be about
tea to-day," Mr. Graham
at once began. "Supposing
I do not know anything
about it, though; what are we to
do then? I know tea comes from
an evergreen plant, something
like a myrtle, but
that isn't much information,
is it? Wait a
minute, though, children," he then went on, "and you
shall have a proper lesson to-day." And as he spoke
Mr. Graham disappeared, soon to return with a fellow
passenger, a tea merchant, who would be the kind
"show-man" for to-day.

"How far did you get?" he asked, as he sat amongst
the group of father, mother, and children, for Mrs.
Graham had also come to "the show" to-day.

"That tea was an evergreen plant, something like the
myrtle," Sybil said, laughing; and all laughed with her.[90]



GATHERING TEA-LEAVES.




SIFTING TEA.


"Then I have it all to do, it seems. Well, the tea-plant
yields a crop after it has been planted three years,
and there are three gatherings during the year: one in
the middle of April, the second at midsummer, and the
third in August and September. I suppose it will do
if we begin here. The plant requires very careful plucking,
only one leaf being allowed to be gathered at a time;
and then a tree must never be plucked too bare.
Women and children, who are generally, though not
always, the tea gatherers, are obliged to wash their hands
before they begin their work, and have to understand
that it is the medium-sized leaves which they have to pick,[91]
leaving the larger ones to gather the dew. When the
baskets are full, into which the leaves have been dropped,
they are carried away hanging to a bamboo slung across
the shoulders, which is a very usual way of carrying[92]
things in China. The tea-plant is the most important
vegetable production of the 'Flowery Land.' But as there
are, you know, several kinds of tea, I think I had better
tell you how that called Congou, which, I suppose, you
generally drink yourselves, is prepared. The leaves are
first spread out in the air to dry, after which they are
trodden by labourers, so that any moisture remaining in
them, after they have been exposed to the air or sun, may
be pressed out; after this they are again heaped
together, and covered for the night with cloths. In this
state they remain all night, when a strange thing happens
to them, spontaneous heating changing the green leaves
to black or brown. They are now more fragrant and
the taste has changed.

"The next process is to twist and crumple the leaves,
by rubbing them between the palms of the hands. In
this crumpled state they are again put in the sun, or if
the day be wet, or the sky threatening, they are baked
over a charcoal fire.

"Leaves, arranged in a sieve, are placed in the middle
of a basket-frame, over a grate in which are hot embers of
charcoal. After some one has so stirred the leaves that they
have all become heated alike, they are ready to be sold
to proprietors of tea-hongs in the towns, when the proprietor
has the leaves again put over the fire and sifted.

"After this, women and girls separate all the bad
leaves and stems from the good ones; sitting, in order to
do so, with baskets of leaves before them, and very carefully
picking out with both their hands all the bad leaves
and stems that the sieve has not got rid of. The light
and useless leaves are then divided from those that are
heavy and good, when the good are put into boxes lined
with paper."[93]

"What is scented Caper Tea?" Mr Graham asked.

"Oh, father! I am so glad that there's something you
have to ask," Leonard said, "as you seemed to know
everything."



SORTING TEA.


"The leaves of scented Orange Pekoe," the merchant
answered, "obtain their fragrance by being mixed with
the flowers of the Arabian jessamine, and when scented
enough, they are separated from the flowers by sieves.
Scented Caper Tea is made from some of the leaves of
this Orange Pekoe.[94]



PRESSING BAGS OF TEA.




TEA-TASTING.


"Those leaves which are prepared at Canton are
black or brown, with a slight tinge of yellow or green.
The tea-leaves growing on an extensive range of hills
in the district of Hokshan are often forwarded to[95]
Canton, where they are made into caper in the following
manner. But I wonder if Leonard knows what
'shan' means?" the merchant interrupted. He did,
for he had seen in his geography that "shan" meant[96]
mountain. "A tea-hong," the merchant continued,
"is furnished with many pans, into which seventeen
or eighteen handfuls of leaves are put. These are
moistened with water, and stirred up by the hand. As
soon as they are soft they are put into coarse bags,
which, tightly fastened, look like large balls.



WEIGHING TEA.
[97]

"These bags are moved backwards and forwards
on the floor by men holding on to wooden poles, and
standing upon them. In each bag the leaves take the
form of pellets, or capers.

"The coarse leaves, gathered from finer ones, thus
made into Caper, after being well fired, are put into
wooden troughs, and chopped into several pieces, and
it is these pieces which become the tea which we call
Caper."

"Thank you very much," said Mr. Graham. "I did
not know anything of this."

"Tea-merchants are most particular, before buying
and selling tea, to taste it and to test its quality.

"And before it is shipped away it is also very carefully
weighed, when I myself, I know, for instance, sit
by, watching the process, and taking account of the
result."

"I suppose tea isn't ever sent about in wheel-barrows?"
then said Leonard, who liked very much
indeed the idea of wheel-barrows with sails up, such as
he had heard about.



GOING TO MARKET.


"I never saw it," was the merchant's reply; "but if
you are interested in wheel-barrows, you might like to
hear about one that I once saw in China. It was conveying
not only goods, and the scales wherewith to
weigh them, to market, but the family also to whom the
goods belonged. The family party made a great impression
upon me. The master of the barrow was pushing
it from behind, a donkey was pulling it in front, and on
the donkey rode a boy; a woman and two children
were driven in the wheel-barrow, besides the goods for
market. I thought the man and donkey must have a
heavy load between them, but both seemed to work most[99]
cheerfully and willingly; and a sail in the centre of
the wheel-barrow, gathering the full force of the wind,
must have been a great help to them.

"The donkey was guided by no reins, only by the
voice of the boy on his back, who carried a stick, but had
no occasion to use it, although every now and then he just
raised it in the air. Sometimes the boy ran beside the
donkey. Anyhow suited the willing little beast, who
was as anxious as his master to do his best. A dog
completed the number of the party.

"The man told me that he was truly fond of this
dog, and gave him 'plenty chow-chow' (plenty to eat), and
that he considered he owed all his wealth to him, as he
had once come to the house, and had since then remained
with the family.

"A strange dog coming to, and remaining at, a house
is looked upon by the Chinese as bringing good luck to
the family, but a strange cat coming is a bad omen."

The children laughed.

"This man certainly treated his dog very well, as do
some few of his countrymen; but, alas! alas! so many
poor little faithful dogs in China, as in other countries,
lead anything but happy lives!"

CHAPTER VI.

LITTLE CHU AND WOO-URH.








O more story
Peep-shows of
what might be
seen in China, no more
wondering what the
Celestials would be like,
for Sybil and Leonard
had now landed on
Chinese soil, and
were themselves at
Shanghai, face to
face with its inhabitants.

Shanghai seemed,
and was, a very
busy place, but not a town of very great importance in
itself, owing, really, its recent prosperity to having
opened its port to foreign commerce. The custom-house,
through which the Grahams' boxes had to be passed,[101]
struck the children as a very strange and beautiful
building, quite different from anything that they had
seen before; and there was a great noise of chattering
going on outside, which sounded most unintelligible.
Coolies were carrying bales of silk and tea to and fro;
there were also, ready at hand, some of the sedan-chairs
that Sybil had longed to see, and everywhere "pig-tails,"
or cues, as they were called, seemed to meet
Leonard's gaze.

But the ships! Watching them was what he enjoyed
better than anything else. The town of Shanghai
is situated on the River Woosung, a tributary of the
Yangtse-kiang, just at that point where it joins the
great river, and about one hundred ships were
anchored before this busy, commercial city. Many
families resident there have their junks and a little
home on the river. There were some very pretty
buildings to be seen at Shanghai, and at one of these
our little party stayed&mdash;on a visit to another missionary
from the Church of England&mdash;for the three
days that they remained there.

At some cities and towns, on the banks of rivers,
floating hotels are to be seen; and as people generally
have to travel by water, and the Chinese are not allowed
to keep open their city-gates after nine o'clock at night,
these hotels prove very useful to those arriving too
late to enter the city. Lighted with lanterns, they look
very pretty floating on the water, and both Sybil and
Leonard were very pleased to be taken over a large
floating hotel before they left Shanghai. Leonard was
very anxious to know how long this town had been open
to foreign commerce, and was told since the Opium
War, which lasted from 1840 to 1842, when the British,[102]
having occupied several Chinese cities, and having
captured Chinkiang in Hoopeh, were advancing to
Nanking, and the Chinese suing for peace, a treaty
was concluded which opened the ports of Amoy, Foochow,
Shanghai, and Ningpo, in addition to Canton, to
the British, who were henceforward to appoint consuls
to live in these towns.

The Chinese are very polite to foreigners in Shanghai;
and as the kind missionary who bade the Grahams
welcome to his home endeavoured, during their short
stay, to interest and show them sights, they enjoyed
themselves very much. Sybil and Leonard could not help
noticing how very many people they met in spectacles,
but they were told that the Chinese suffer very much
from ophthalmia, and that when they wear spectacles,
some of which are very large, they often have sore
eyes.

"There is one thing I cannot understand the Chinese
doing," Leonard said one day to Sybil: "and that is,
everybody that we have seen, as yet, spoiling their tea
by not taking any milk or sugar in it; and father says
all the Chinese drink tea like that, and call milk white
blood, and only use it in medicine."

"Tea like that would not suit us," Sybil answered,
"as we like plenty of both milk and sugar; but I dare
say they think we spoil our tea by putting such things
into it."

A visit to some rice-fields, a little sight-seeing,
a little more watching of ships carrying rice and other
products away, and then it was time for the Grahams
once more to take their seats on board.



THE CUSTOM-HOUSE, SHANGHAI.


We can imagine how both children strained their
eyes, as they steamed farther and farther away from[104]
Shanghai, to see what that port looked like in the
distance, and how Sybil examined her map as they
left the province of Kiang-su, to see at what port, and
in what province, they would next touch.

This was Ningpo, in Che-kiang, but they did not
land here; neither did they go on shore at their next
halting-place, Foochow, in the province of Fu-kien.
It was at Amoy, in the same province, where their
father had a missionary friend, who had invited them
to pay him a few days' or a week's visit, as would suit
them best, that they next purposed landing, and this
they did about four days after they left Shanghai.

"Whoever thought," Sybil said one day on board,
"that we should actually be on the Yellow Sea ourselves?
It seems almost too good to be true now."

"I never knew people like to stare more at anybody
than they seem to like to stare at us here," Leonard
thought to himself when first at Amoy.

He and Sybil were then being very carefully observed
by a group of natives of that place, but Leonard
had yet to become accustomed to being stared at in
China.

"And, father," he said later, "I wonder why so
many of them wear turbans? I did not notice people
doing this at Shanghai."



A FLOATING HOTEL AT SHANGHAI.


Mr. Graham did not know the reason of this
either; but he and Leonard were later informed
that the men of Amoy adopted the turban to hide
the tail when they were made to wear it by
their conquerors, and that they never gave it up.
Leonard was also told that they were good soldiers,
which, he said, he thought they looked. One thing
remarkable about the people of Amoy was that the[106]
different families seemed to consist almost entirely of
boys. A great many of the inhabitants were very
poor, living crowded together in dirty houses very
barely furnished. Mrs. Graham had not to be long
in China to discover that cleanliness is not a Chinese
virtue. Sybil bought some very pretty artificial flowers
of some of the inhabitants of Amoy, which they had
themselves made. They manufactured them principally,
she heard, to be placed on graves.



THE PORT OF SHANGHAI.


Like other Chinese, these people were very superstitious.
Here and there large blocks of granite were to
be met with, which were regarded by them with reverence,
and looked upon as good divinities. On one the
Grahams saw inscriptions, which related some history of
the place.

Granite seemed to abound here, for the temples and
monasteries were, for the most part, erected on the
heights between rocks of this description.

Two days after reaching Amoy, Sybil was dreadfully
distressed, and shocked, to see a little girl
named Chu, of eleven years old, put up for sale by her
own parents. At ten dollars (&pound;1) only was she valued;[107]
and for this paltry sum the parents were ready to sell
her to any one who would bid it for her. They were
very poor, and could not afford to keep her any longer.
She had four sisters and only two brothers; the youngest
of all, the baby, was to be drowned by her father, later
on in the day, in a tub of water. They had never done
anything like this before: this man and woman had
never killed a child, although they had had five girls,
and many of their neighbours had thought nothing of
destroying most of their daughters so soon as they were
born; but now, as the man was ill, and able to earn so
little, they had resolved to rid themselves of two of them
that day. If the baby lived, the mother comforted herself
by saying, she must be sold later, or grow up in
poverty and misery.

Parents think it very necessary that their children
should marry, and sometimes sell, or give them away,
to their friends, when they are quite little, to be the
future wives of the sons of their new owners.

If sold, they will then fetch about two dollars for
every year that they have lived; so a child of five years
old would fetch ten dollars; and this little girl, put up
for sale, was now eleven years old; therefore she was
being offered, poor little thing, below half price. And
some little girls of Amoy have been even offered for
sale for a few pence!



A FAMILY OF AMOY.




THE MISSIONARY&#39;S TEACHER.


It seemed incomprehensible to Sybil, as it must to
us, that a mother could wish either to kill or to sell
her little child, but neither the one nor the other
event is uncommon in some parts of China, where the
parent is poor; and even amongst the well-to-do
classes little girls are sometimes put to death, if the
parents have more daughters than they care to rear,[109]
not only at Amoy, but at other places in the neighbourhood;
and even Chinese ladies will sometimes have
their poor little daughters put to death.

"Why do people not kill their boys too?" Sybil
asked, when she heard all about this.



"Because when they grow up they can earn money
that girls could not earn; and not only can they help to
support their parents when old, but they can worship
their ancestral tablets and keep up the family name."

"I am sure a girl would do this too."

"Her doing so would be considered of little use."



A VIEW OF AMOY, WITH A BLOCK OF GRANITE IN THE FOREGROUND.


It seemed that the very day before Mr. Graham[111]
arrived in Amoy, a widow lady there had had her little
baby girl destroyed, and then, in her widow's dress,
had sat down quietly to talk matters over with her
sister-in-law, who thought that she had acted very
wisely. Killing a daughter, in China, is hardly looked
upon as being sinful. A widow's mourning consists of
all white and a band round the head, white being
Chinese deepest mourning.



LADIES OF AMOY.




LITTLE CHU.


Whilst Mr. Graham stood by, a purchaser for little
Chu stepped forward, holding the ten dollars in his hand;
but the missionary was before him, and through a teacher,[112]
whom he had already been able to engage, offered the
father twice that sum not to sell the little girl at all, but
to let him have her for a servant. He hesitated, as
though he would rather sell his child right off to any
Chinaman than trust her to a foreign "barbarian."
But the sum tempted him; and although he could not
understand how receiving it did not give Chu altogether
to her purchaser, he seemed to be contented, especially
when the teacher explained that she would not be a slave,
but would be paid for what work she did. Little Chu
was well off to have stepped into so happy a service, and
the baby was rescued also. A certain sum was to be[113]
paid weekly to the father, towards her support, until he
recovered his health, if he would only spare her; and both
parents, who really fondly loved their children, were
very glad to spare their baby, fifth girl though she was.
Her name was Woo-Urh, which means fifth girl.

It did not take long to have little Chu tidily dressed,
with money that her new master supplied, and her poor
mother, who had some beads stowed away, now looked
them out and also put these on her. Chu was only
eleven years old, but poverty and care had given the little
one an old expression beyond her years. Chinese children
of from ten to sixteen years of age&mdash;about which
time they are supposed to marry&mdash;have a fringe cut over
their foreheads, and Chu wore this fringe now. It has
to grow again before they marry.

That evening Chu was sent round to Mr. Graham's
brother missionary's house, where, as Sybil's little maid,
she was housed for the two or three days longer that they
would spend at Amoy; and though Chu had come to live
with foreigners, in the family of a "barbarian," as her
father thought, we can well imagine that she had never
been so happy in her life. Mr. Graham had told her
parents that when they reached Hong-Kong he should
send her to the mission school.

"And the father would have killed the baby himself!"
said Sybil. "How could he have done so?"

"That is the marvel; but it is generally the fathers
who commit the deed; other people might be punished
if they interfered."


[114]







CHAPTER VII.


LEONARD'S EXPLOIT IN FORMOSA.




BOUT the middle of November,
eleven weeks
after Mr. Graham and
his family had left England, they arrived in the
beautiful island of Formosa, whither they had crossed
over from Amoy.

Three more persons were now added to the travelling
party&mdash;the teacher, a Chinese maid, and little Chu, the
latter having already begun to show herself really
useful.



ENTRANCE TO THE PORT OF TAKOW.


There is but little fun in travelling, and one does
not see half there is to be seen unless one climbs; and
as the Grahams were all bent on having fun and seeing
as much as they could, on reaching the port of Takow,
in Formosa, they ascended a very high mountain,
called Monkey Mountain, because it is the home of very[115]
many monkeys, and they were rewarded by having, from
its height, a capital view of the entrance to the port.
To the front of the mountain were some European
houses, belonging to English merchants from Amoy.
The port of Takow is a very difficult one at which to
anchor, and is closed for commerce during six months of
the year, whilst the wind is blowing in an adverse direction;
but when the wind and tide are favourable, barks
pass between some rocks at the entrance to the port. It
is only at the north that the water is deep enough[116]
for merchant-ships to pass by. Here Leonard saw men
fishing quite differently from what he had ever seen
people fish before; and as they walked in the water
behind their nets, which they seemed to manage very
cleverly, he wished so much that he could have been
there with them.

Takow is one of the four ports in Formosa which,
through treaties, have been thrown open to foreign trade,
the others being those of Kelung, Tamsui, and Taiwan-fu.



THE EXTREME NORTH OF TAKOW.


Formosa, as its name implies, is a very lovely,
picturesque island, and the Spaniards, who first made it
known to Europeans, named it "Isla Formosa," which,
in their language, means "beautiful island." Takow
seemed to abound in tropical vegetation, palm-trees
being very conspicuous. The gong, used everywhere in
China, was much in use here also; and as in other places
men carried things by balancing them across their
shoulders, so also they did here. But as Mr. Graham's
special object in coming to this island was to visit
Poahbi, the first centre of the population of a tribe
of aborigines, whom the Chinese have named Pepohoans,
or strangers of the plain, he moved on thither[117]
as quickly as he could. The country through which
they now passed was very beautiful, palm-trees and
bamboos overshadowing the way.



FISHERMEN OF TAKOW.


Although it was the month of November, the
weather was hot here, and women, wearing white calico
dresses, were hard at work in the fields. Many of
the women of Formosa had compressed feet, and most
of the children wore charms round their necks.

The Pepohoans used to live in fertile plains, but
when greedy and grasping Chinese drove them from[118]
the rich and beautiful lands that were then theirs, and
had belonged to their ancestors before them, they took
shelter, and made themselves homes, in mountain fastnesses.

Sybil and Leonard were charmed with the people of
Poahbi, and thought both their faces and manners very
pretty. Although some of the people stared at the
foreigners, and laughed at them, many wished to make
them welcome in their midst. One woman gave them
shelter for the night&mdash;a very kind-hearted woman, with
a dear little baby, and a very clean and comfortable
home. She was a Christian.

At Poahbi Mr. Graham saw a little Christian chapel,
which the natives had not only built, but which they
also kept up, themselves. Pepohoans are good builders,
and do also much work in the fields. They have a
most affectionate remembrance of the Dutch, who were
once their masters, but who were afterwards expelled
from Formosa by a Chinese pirate.



VIEW OF TAKOW, A TOWN IN FORMOSA.


The huts, or bamboo cottages, of the Pepohoans,
raised on terraces three or four feet high, looked very
picturesque, and consisted first of a framework of
bamboo, through which crossbars of reeds were run;
the whole being thickly covered over with clay. The
houses were afterwards whitened with lime. A barrier
of prickly stems extended round the huts, throwing
a shade over them, whilst these dwellings often had for
roofing a thatch of dried leaves. Most things in Formosa
were made of bamboo, such as tables, chairs, beds,
pails, rice-measures, jars, hats, pipes, chop-sticks, goblets,
paper, and pens. Many of the Pepohoans' habitations
were built on three sides of a four-cornered spot,
with a yard in the centre, where the families sometimes[120]
passed their evenings together. The natives assembled
here, in numbers, at about nine o'clock, where they
made a fire when it was cold. Old and young people
here often formed a circle on the ground, sitting
together with their arms crossed, smoking, and talking.
It was not unusual for dogs also to surround them.
These people were fond of singing, but played no musical
instruments. Sybil said, directly she saw them, that
they were just the sort of people she liked, but this was
before she heard that they ate serpents and rats. The
women had a quantity of hair, which they wound round
their heads like crowns. None of them painted their
faces. Some of the men were very badly dressed. All
Pepohoans seemed to have very beautiful black eyes. In
the different villages the inhabitants were different, and
where they had most contact with the Chinese they dressed
better, but were less affable. They seemed to be a
very honest race.

The Pepohoans are subject to the Chinese Government.
Some of them, like the Chinese, have been ruined
by opium. The aborigines, consisting of different
tribes, talk different dialects. The people of one tribe,
the most savage of all, are very warlike, and think nothing
of killing and eating their Chinese neighbours when
they get the chance to do so; therefore, they are held
in great terror. Sybil and Leonard would not have liked
to have visited this tribe, for they also hate Europeans.



MOUNTAINEERS OF FORMOSA.


There was a grandness of beauty in this island of
Formosa which could not fail, more and more, to charm
Mrs. Graham, and many a pretty sketch did she here
make, both for herself and for Sybil's letters. Sybil
also liked being here very much; "but if she had only
seen," Leonard said, what he and his father saw one[122]
day, when they went for a ramble through the mountains,
whilst Sybil was helping her mother to sketch by
keeping her company, and making clever little attempts
at sketching herself, "she would want to be off that
very moment."

There were caverns in Formosa, and they were walking
along, exploring some, Leonard some little way in front
of Mr. Graham, the teacher, and a native guide, who followed
a few yards behind, when the English boy suddenly
caught sight of two huge, yellow serpents twined round
the branch of an overhanging tree. No one but Leonard
was near enough to see them, and as the first creature
stretched its dreadful-looking head out, hissing towards
him, the brave, self-possessed little fellow, who held a
stick in his hand, struck his deadly foe with it with all
his might, and hit and aimed so well that he had the
satisfaction, the next moment, of seeing the serpent roll
over and over down the rock. But then the further one
(which, although rather smaller than the other, measured
about six feet) wound, in a moment, its wriggling body
round the branch of the tree, stretching its head out
almost within reach of Leonard, when the boy-guide and
Mr. Graham, the same instant, came upon the spot. The
boy, accustomed to such encounters, at once dealt the
snake a blow, that caused it to lose its balance, and
thus all were able to pass on their way in thankfulness
and safety.

When Sybil heard of the adventure she was very
proud of her little brother; but, as he had imagined
when she heard that Formosa was inhabited by serpents,
she was glad also to think that it was settled for
them to leave that island for Swatow in two days' time.



PEPOHOANS AND THEIR HUT.


That evening was spent very pleasantly comparing[124]
notes of adventure with an English gentleman, who had
been in Formosa for some time, and now called upon
Mr. Graham and his family, who were staying at the
consul's. He had seen and done a good deal, he said,
but he spoke very highly of Leonard's brave exploit.



HUT OF ONE OF THE SAVAGE TRIBES.


In the course of his wanderings, he told them, he had
visited the village of Lalung, which is situated on the
narrowest part of a large river. During the rainy season
the waters would here rise and cover a vast bed, opening
out a new passage across the land, and flowing away
towards the eastern plain. Great mountain heights[125]
surrounded the bed of the river, and the violence of the
torrent carried away very large quantities of all sorts of
rubbish, which the sea would collect, and deposit, along
the eastern coast. Mr. Hardy explained to Leonard how
this would account for the port of Tha&iuml;-ouan disappearing,
and that of Takow forming lower down.



SERPENTS OF FORMOSA.
[126]



THE BED OF THE RIVER LALUNG DURING THE DRY SEASON.
[127]

"Formosa," he continued, "shows very plainly how
the violence of waters can quite transform the physical
aspect of a country."

Mr. Hardy then told them that he, with a guide, had
once visited the bed of the river of Lalung, during the
dry season, as an explorer, when he had taken off his boots
and socks, so as to be able to walk wherever he chose,
and fathom the depth of the water in different parts.

How Leonard wished he had been with him on this occasion,
which seemed to him a regular voyage of discovery!

Two days later, as arranged, the Grahams made sail
for Swatow. In crossing the channel, which separates
the island from the mainland, Leonard, as usual, had
some questions to ask.

"What made the Chinese call Formosa Tai-wan?"

"Because that word means the terraced harbour."

"The east coast hasn't a harbour at all, has it?"

"No; mountains are on the east, and to the west
are flat and fertile plains, and all the ports."

"I suppose you know, Sybil, that there are some
wild beasts in Formosa?" Leonard went on.

"Yes, I heard Mr. Hardy say so: leopards, tigers,
and wolves."

"I think it's my turn to ask a question now," Mrs.
Graham said. "I wonder if you and Sybil can tell
me what grows principally in Formosa?"

"Rice," Sybil began, "sugar, wheat, beans, tea,
coffee, pepper."

"Cotton, tobacco, silk, oranges, peaches, and
plums," Leonard ended. "We saw most of these
things growing ourselves, so we ought to know."

"Yes; and flax, indigo, camphor, and many fruits
that you have not mentioned."[128]

"The Chinese part of the island, I suppose, belongs
to Fukien?" Sybil said, "as it is painted the same colour
on my map."

"Yes."

What religion had the aborigines? she then wanted
to know.

Mr. Graham answered this question by telling her
that he believed they had no priesthood at all.

"What a pity it is," Sybil said, "that a number of
missionaries could not be sent out there. I do so like
the Pepohoans!"

"How long is it now since the Dutch were driven
away?" Leonard asked. "And how long were they in
Formosa?"

"About 1634 the Dutch took possession of the
island, and built several forts, but a Chinese pirate
drove them out in 1662, and made himself king of the
western part. In 1683 his descendants submitted to the
authority of the Chinese Emperor, to whom they are now
tributary. The Chinese colonists, however, often rebel."

"People have not known very long, have they, that
the island of Formosa is important?"

"No; only since about 1852."

"About how many inhabitants has Tha&iuml;-ouan, the
capital?" Leonard asked.

"I should think about 70,000, but it is now decreasing
in population."

"How much you know, father," Sybil said. "I
wish I knew all you did!"

"I am afraid that is not very much; but if you
notice things that you come across, and try to remember
what you hear and what you read, you will soon gain
plenty of knowledge and useful information."[129]



SWATOW.
[130]

"I wonder what Swatow is like?" Leonard then said;
but he had not long to wait to find out, for a week after
leaving Formosa they landed at Swatow, the port of
Chaou-Chou-foo, in the province of Kwang-tung, where
once again, for a fortnight, they were made very
welcome: this time by some friends of the missionary
with whom they had stayed at Amoy.



E-CHUNG.


Their home, for the present, was very prettily
situated on a range of low hills. Many pieces of granite
were scattered about on the summit of these hills, as
they were about Amoy, which some people say have
been caused to appear through volcanic irruptions.
On them also were Chinese inscriptions. Leonard
was delighted because the Chinese teacher cut his name[131]
on one of these pieces of granite. The houses of Swatow
were built with a kind of mortar, made of China clay,
and attached to some of them were very pretty gardens.

In front of the Consulate, which was a very large
building, was a flag-staff, with a flag flying.



WOMAN OF SWATOW.


The ceilings of the house, in which the Grahams
stayed, was painted with flowers and birds, and some of
the windows were also painted so as to look like open
fans. The Chinese are fond of decorating their rooms
and painting their ornaments, and the people of
Swatow seemed to be better painters than the
Chinese; but they kept their pictures hidden, only a
very few of them producing any to show our friends.
The people of Swatow are also noted for fan-painting.[132]

Sybil thought some of the women of Swatow rather
nice-looking, but, like other ladies of the "Flowery Land,"
they had a wonderful way of dressing their hair. One
woman, Leonard declared, had hers done to represent a
large shell. A young lady, to whom Sybil was introduced,
had the thickest hair that she had ever seen.
She and other Chinese girls wore it hanging down their
backs in twists. She was just fifteen, and Sybil was
told that she was going to be married in about a year's
time, so she would soon have to begin to let her fringe
grow. She was the daughter of a rich man, and had
such pretty, dark eyes.

Round a girl's and woman's head, or to fasten up
her back hair, ornaments are generally worn. E-Chung
wore rather a large one round her head. Sybil was
allowed to spend an afternoon, and take some tea, with
this young lady, but they could not talk much together.
E-Chung knew, and spoke, a little of what is called
pidgin, or business English, because many business, or
shop, people and those who mix most with the English,
speak this strange language to them; but Sybil could
understand hardly any of it. Before E-Chung heard
that Sybil had a brother, she said to her, "You one
piecee chilo?" meaning to ask if she were the only
child. Then she was trying to describe somebody to
Sybil whose appearance did not please her, so she made
an ugly grimace and said, "That number one ugly man
all-same so fashion," meaning "just like this." Another
time she meant to ask Sybil if she were not very rich,
so she said, "You can muchee money?"

The hair down Sybil's back was such a contrast to
her friend's, as was also her rather pale complexion.
E-Chung wished very much to enamel Sybil's face, as[133]
she did her own, and could not understand why she
should so persistently refuse to have it done.

Chinese ladies seldom do without their rouge, and
often keep their amahs, or maids, from three to four
hours at a time doing their hair.



SYBIL.



[134]








CHAPTER VIII.

THE BOAT POPULATION.




R. GRAHAM had thought of visiting Chaou-chou,
a very fertile city on the river Han, but
was advised not to do so, as foreigners are
disliked by its inhabitants; and he was therefore told
that they might have cause to regret going thither.
It used not to be an uncommon thing for these people
to greet an Englishman with a shower of stones.
People have tried to establish an English consulate
there, but have not succeeded, although the city is open
to foreign commerce; and Jui Lin, the late viceroy of
Canton, succeeded in making people in the neighbourhood
much more orderly.

A very large bridge crosses the Han River at this
place, a picture of which the teacher had, and showed to
the children. It is made of stone, and composed of
many arches, or rather square gateways, under which
ships pass to and fro. On the bridge, on each side of
the causeway, are houses and shops.[135]



THE BRIDGE OF CHAOU CHOU.
[136]

"I should not care much to live in them," said
Leonard.

Nor would the teacher, he replied; for they did
not look, and were not supposed to be, at all safe.



ARCH OF THE BRIDGE OF CHAOU-CHOU.


Two pieces of wood are suspended between the
arches, which the inhabitants take up in the day-time
and let down at night, to prevent, as they say, evil
spirits passing under their homes and playing them
tricks.

It was a very happy fortnight that was spent at[137]
Swatow, and Sybil was sorry to leave this port to go on
to Hong-Kong. Somehow, although they were not
going to settle down now, and had still Macao and
Canton to visit, it seemed like bringing the end nearer&mdash;going
much nearer to it, when they went to Hong-Kong
even for a few days, for there her parents were to
be left behind when she and Leonard returned to
England. This English colony, the little island of
Hong-Kong, about eight miles in length, is separated
from the mainland by a very narrow strait, in the midst
of a number of small islands.



CHINESE BOAT-CHILDREN.


The Bishop of Hong-Kong had kindly invited Mr.[138]
Graham and his family to stay at his residence, St. Paul's
College, during the few days that they now remained
at Hong-Kong, before continuing their tour and returning
to settle down, and the kind invitation had
been gladly and gratefully accepted.



CHAIR-MEN OF HONG-KONG.


The missionary's party landed in a boat, or rather, in
a floating house, for the people to whom it belonged lived
here, and it was their only home.

The children had heard that there were so many[139]
inhabitants in China that for very many of them there was
no house accommodation, and that these lived in boats,
and were called the boat population; and Leonard was
delighted to be travelling in one of these house-boats himself,
and seeing the homes of the boat people. Their very
little children were tied to doors, and other parts of the
boat, by long ropes. Those who were three or four years
old had floats round their backs, so that if they fell overboard
they would not sink, and their parents could jump
in after them. Most care seemed to be taken of the
boys. Instead of being dedicated to "Mother," boat-children,
soon after they are born, are dedicated to Kow-wong,
or Nine Kings, and for three days and nights before
they marry, which ceremony takes place in the middle
of the night, Taouist priests chant prayers to the Kow-wong.

The boats in which live the Taouist priests, for the
boat population, are called Nam-Mo-Teng. These are
anchored in certain parts, that the priests may be sent
for when needed. Their boats look partly like temples,
and have altars and idols, also incense burning within
them. The names of the priests who live there, and the
rites they perform, are written up in the boats. The
boat people can have everything they require without
going on shore at all. There are even river barbers and
policemen, which latter are very necessary, considering
that there are so many pirates.



A PORTRAIT-PAINTER OF HONG-KONG.


It seemed strange to Sybil and Leonard to
think that boat-children never went on shore, might
never do so, and would even marry on board their
boat homes; but it did not seem at all strange to
the little children themselves, who played about
on board quite as happily as did children on shore.[140]
They looked strong, and seemed to be fond of one
another. One woman going along was very angry
with one of her children, and for a punishment
threw him into the water, but he had a float on his[141]
back, and was quickly brought back again. These
women often carry their children on their backs, but this
is a most usual way of carrying children in China, both
amongst the land and water people.

Sybil had already often had her wish fulfilled, of
travelling in sedan-chairs, and as that is the regular mode
of travelling in Hong-Kong, directly they arrived here
coolies were to be seen, standing and sitting, on the pier
beside their chairs, waiting for a fare. Very eager they
seemed to be to secure either people or their baggage.
And Sybil liked being borne along in these chairs even
better than she had expected.

The sedans were made of bamboo, covered with oil-cloth,
and carried on long poles. A great many sedan-chair-bearers
have no fixed homes, living day and night
in the open air, and buying their food at stalls on the road.
They take care to keep their chairs in very good condition,
ready to hire out whenever they are needed. Leonard
was charmed with his bearers. They spoke such funny
pigeon English to him, and made him wonder why they
would put "ee" to the end of so many of their words.
When Leonard once wished to speak to his father, who was
on in front, and succeeded in making his bearers understand
this, one of them said "My no can catchee." They
admired the boy very much, and wanted to persuade
him to let them carry him one day to a "handsome face-taking-man,"
but he could not understand at all, at
first, that they wanted him to let them carry him
somewhere to have his portrait taken. "My likee,"
one said, pointing to Leonard's face, "welly much."
The Chinese do not paint pictures very well, and sometimes,
instead of a brush, will use their fingers and
nails.[142]



VIEW OF HONG-KONG.
[143]

The chair-men called Leonard "Captain" several
times, which seemed to be a common way of addressing
strange "gentlemen."

They then asked him how Mr. Turner was, but he
shook his head to show that he knew nobody of this name.
They either did not understand or believe him.

"He hab got London-side," they explained.

Thinking that if he tacked a double "e" on to all
his words he would be speaking the language they
talked so much, he said "No-ee know-ee," and shook
his head again. I think it was the expression on his
face, and the shake of his head, which made them
understand at last what he wished to say to them.

It seems that the natives of Hong-Kong, as well as
other parts of China, think that every Englishman
must know every other Englishman; having, indeed,
such very small ideas of our important country, that
they really think our wealth consists in our possessing
Hong-Kong.



THE CLOCK TOWER, HONG-KONG.


The first view that the Grahams had of this little
island was a chain of mountains rising in the background
to lofty peaks, and diminishing as they approached
the sea into small hills and steep rocks. Not
so very long ago, Sybil was told, Hong-Kong used to be
a deserted island, though it now contained flower-gardens,
orchards, woods, large trees, beautiful grass slopes,
and very many buildings. The English town of
Victoria was built along the sea-coast. As Hong-Kong
belongs to Great Britain, the Government here was, of
course, English; there were Christian temples, as well
as Buddhist, and many European edifices were conspicuous
in the Chinese streets. Then there were also
large European club-houses, and, best of all, the[145]
Cathedral. The sea-shore stretched round towards a
very beautiful port, which opened out to the west by a
pass called Lyce-moun, and to the east by the Lama
Pass.

"I do think, do you know, Leonard," Sybil said, as
she wished her brother "Good-night" the evening after
they had arrived at Hong-Kong, "that China is rather
a 'Flowery Land' after all. I do not think I shall ever
forget Formosa, at all events."

"We have seen pretty sights since we came to
China," Leonard said, agreeing with his sister.

The next day Sybil and he were taken into the
Queen's Road, which crossed the town from west to
east, to the right of which was a regular labyrinth of
streets, some leading into very fine roads. In one
part of Hong-Kong nothing but shops and houses
of business were to be seen. One of its principal
ornaments was the tall clock-tower, which made even
high trees beside it look quite small.

The most ancient houses of the colony are in a
street that leads to the clock-tower, and close by it is
also the hotel of Hong-Kong. Into this Sybil and
Leonard were taken to have some tiffin, or lunch,
whilst their sedans and bearers waited for them not far
off, under some trees.

Leonard took a good view afterwards of a man in a
turban whom they passed, because, as he was so important
a person as a policeman, he thought Sybil
might like to describe him in one of her letters, and she
might perhaps forget what he was like.

Sybil had, as yet, only written one of her promised
letters, but this had been full of news, and had told of
rides in sedan-chairs, little Chu and Woo-urh, and all sorts[146]
of things; and before they moved on to Macao, she had
determined to write another letter, and tell of Leonard
saving himself from the serpent, and what they saw in
Hong-Kong. This seemed to be a very busy place.
Steamers were always either coming or going; and here,
too, telegrams were constantly arriving. Besides English
merchants, Chinese, American, French, German, Hindoo
merchants, and others also traded with the little island,
and shared what wealth she had. Hong-Kong is very
English-looking, compared with other places in China,
and the people are not only governed by English
laws, but their crimes are tried by English judges.
But even at Canton, Shanghai, and other ports where
the English have settlements, they now claim, and have
a voice in trials for crime. It is only because Hong-Kong
belongs to the English that telegraph-wires are to
be found there, as the Chinese will not have them anywhere
else, because they think that they would offend
the ghosts, or spirits, of the places through which they
would pass. For the same reason also the Chinese have
hardly any railroads. Even children could easily
recognise here the introduction of English ways and
manners.

Lily Keith was very fond of shopping, therefore in
her next letter Sybil not only gave an account of
Leonard's bravery, of which she was really more
proud than Leonard himself, but also described a visit
that she had paid to some shops.

"We went to some of the best of all the shops in
Hong-Kong to-day," she wrote, "and as we were going
into the door of one, the proprietor came to meet us.
Father said he was a merchant. He spoke English, and
was very grandly dressed in silk, and wore worked shoes.[147]
His shopmen also wore very handsome clothes, and
served us standing behind beautifully polished counters.
In one part of the shop were all kinds of silk materials,
and some stuff called grass-matting. We went down-stairs
to see furniture and beautiful porcelain. The
principal curiosities had come from Canton, so I suppose
when we get there we shall find still better things; and
in Canton people paint on that pretty rice paper. Across
the road were meat, fish, vegetable, and puppy-dog
shops. Yes, the Chinese do eat dogs: in some shops in
Hong-Kong we have seen a number for sale; and they
eat cats and rats too. We could tell a shop in which
clothes were sold some little distance off, because an
imitation jacket, or something of that sort, was hung up
outside, as well as the long sign-boards, which told what
kind of shops they were. Leonard says I am to tell
you that a policeman was outside. He always knows
policemen now by turbans that they wear, and they
often hold a little cane in their hands; and on the pathway
a man sat, wearing a hat just like one of those
funny-looking things, with a point, that we wore for fun
sometimes in the garden. There are no windows to the
shops.



TEMPLE OF KWAN-YIN.


"Oh! but some of the Chinese do believe such
strange things. The other day our amah told Leonard
and me to chatter our teeth three times and blow. We
could not understand what she meant us to do until she
did it first. We had heard a crow caw, so she thought
if we did not do this afterwards we should be very
unlucky. The other day a coolie fell down and broke a
number of things. He had not to replace any of them,
but the master had to buy all the things again because
it was fine weather. If it had been dirty and slippery,[149]
the boy must have bought them. None of us could
understand the meaning of this till it was explained
to us. If it had been a slippery day, the boy ought to have
taken care, and it would have been very careless of him
to fall; but if he did so in fine weather, some god must
have made him slip, they think, and therefore he could
not help it. The heathen Chinese have such a number
of gods and goddesses.



A SHADOW-SHOW.


"The other day we passed the Temple of Kwan-Yin,
the goddess of mercy. The Hong-Kong people
think an immense deal of her, and her temple is in such
a pretty place, with many trees round it. She is a
Buddhist divinity. A number of beggars were outside
begging, and they nearly always get something here.
Very many Chinese beggars are blind, and there are
also lepers in China. Barriers were put up to keep
visitors, who were not wanted, such as evil spirits, from
going in. People say that evil spirits only care to go
through a straight way, and never trouble to go anywhere
in a crooked direction. Over the doorway were
some characters, which father's teacher has written out
for me. They were, being read from right to left,
backwards: 'Te&euml;n How Kov Meaou,' and signify,
'The Ancient Temple of the Queen of Heaven.' Tien-How
is the goddess of sailors, and often called 'The
Queen of Heaven.' To the right was a doctor's
shop, where prescriptions were sold to the priests;
and to the left an old priest was selling little tapers
which the worshippers were to burn. We looked in
for a few moments, and saw people kneeling down
and asking the goddess to cure their sick friends.
She was seated at the end of the temple, behind an
altar, on which were bronze vases, candles, and lighted[151]
sticks of incense. A gong was outside, and on the walls
of the temple were different representations of acts of
mercy that the goddess was supposed to have performed.
On the roof were dragons. The dragon is the Chinese
god of rain.

"Leonard says I am to tell you that some of
the Celestials thought once that he was going to beat
them because he carried a walking-stick. Chinamen,
excepting policemen and mandarins, are only allowed
to carry them when they grow old.

"We saw a very strange sort of show the other day,
called a shadow-show. A man, inside a kind of Punch
and Judy house, made, with the help of a lantern, all sorts
of figures, or rather, shadows, appear on the top of the
Punch and Judy. It looked so strange, but Leonard
said he thought the people looking at it were stranger
still, what with the hats they wore and the funny way
they did their hair. He declared one woman had horns.
I never saw such pretty lanterns as the Chinese have.
Father says that on the fifteenth day of their first month
(which is not always the same, as their New Year's
Day, like our Easter, is a movable feast regulated by
the moon) there is a feast of lanterns, when all people,
both on land and on the water, hang up most beautiful
lamps, some being made to look like animals, balls of
fire, or even like Kwan-Yin herself holding a child.

"Is it not strange New Year's Day next year will be
on the twenty-ninth of January, and in 1882 on
February eighteenth?

"I seem to have ever so much more to tell you, but
I am too tired now to write it. I am glad you liked
mother's pictures that I sent last time. I could only
write that one short letter in Formosa. We are going[152]
on to Macao (it is pronounced Macow) the day after
to-morrow, then we stay at Canton, and then come
back here. It will be so dreadful when that time
comes, but I try not to think about it. Dear mother
does sometimes, I can see. We all went to the
Cathedral on Sunday.


"I hope I shall soon have a long letter from you.
"Believe me, dear Lily,
"Always your affectionate friend,
"Sybil Graham.


"Hong-Kong, December, 1880."






[153]








CHAPTER IX.

AT CANTON.








 &nbsp; PASSENGER-BOAT conveyed
our little travellers,
and their parents, in three
days, from Hong-Kong to Macao,
a pretty little sea-side place at
the entrance of the Bocca Tigris,
a little gulf, to the head of which
is the city of Canton.

Macao was not as full now as
it had been during the summer months, when many
people resort thither from Canton for change of air
and to enjoy the fresh sea-breezes. A beautiful walk,
called the Grand Parade, surrounds its picturesque bay.

As Macao belongs to the Portuguese, a great many
of the inhabitants speak that language.

Mr. and Mrs. Graham and their children stayed,
whilst at Macao, at the Grand Hotel, which was situated
on the Parade, where was also a very pretty jetty, on
which Sybil and Leonard liked very much to walk.
Here, again, the houses were painted. In a pretty
street close by the Grand Parade, protected on both
sides by walls, the Grahams were shown houses whose[154]
windows used to have barriers of iron. These houses,
they were told, were a kind of prison, called Emigration
Agencies, but where in reality poor coolies were kept for
sale. This traffic had, happily, now been done away
with.

Some of the houses in Macao seemed to be painted
all colours, and many of the windows were bordered
with red, the favourite colour. Most of the houses
could boast of large rooms. Not very much commerce
seemed to be carried on here. Leonard was one day
taken to pay the European troops a visit in their
garrison.

At four o'clock in the afternoon many people walked
upon the Parade. Most of the Christians here were
Roman Catholics, which was natural, considering that
the place belonged to the Portuguese. Bells, calling
people to church, rang two or three times a day, and
these, and the bugle-call from the garrison, were the
principal sounds heard. It was interesting to visit
Macao, because here, in its quiet prettiness, the poet
Camoens, when banished, spent some of his lonely
years, and wrote a great part of his epic poem
"Lusiad;" and here also a French painter, named
Chinnery, had produced some of his pretty paintings
and sketches. Sybil was old enough to care about
such things, and to find both pleasure and interest
in visiting any places once made memorable by the
footprints left there of either good or great men; and
when she had heard the poet's story, she was very sorry
for him!



MACAO.


Camoens, who was the epic poet of Portugal, was
born in Lisbon in 1524. An epic poet is one who
writes narratives, or stories, which often relate heroic[156]
deeds. When banished by royal authority to Santarem,
Camoens joined the expedition of John III. against
Morocco, and lost his right eye in an engagement
with the Moors in the Straits of Gibraltar. People
in Lisbon, who would not admire his poetry, now
thought nothing of his bravery. Sad and disappointed,
he went to India in 1553; but being offended by what
he saw the Portuguese authorities doing in India, he
wrote a satire about them, called "Follies in India,"
and made fun of the Viceroy. For doing this, he was
banished to Macao in 1556, where he lived for six
years, writing "The Lusiad." On being recalled, he
was shipwrecked, and lost everything that he had in
the world but this epic poem, which he held in one hand
above the waves, while he swam to shore with the other;
and after suffering many misfortunes, he arrived in Lisbon
in 1569, possessed of nothing else. He dedicated his
poem to the young king Sebastian, who allowed him to
stay at the court, and gave him a pension. But when
Sebastian died he had nothing at all, and a faithful
Indian servant begged for him in the streets. At last
he died in the hospital at Lisbon, in 1579. Sixteen years
later Camoens was appreciated, and people hunted for his
grave, to erect a monument to his memory, but had
much difficulty even in finding it.

The "Lusiad" celebrates the chief events in
Portugal's history, and has been called "a gallery of
epic pictures, in which all the great achievements of
Portuguese heroism are represented." The poem has
been translated into English, French, Italian, Spanish,
German, and Polish.

After a short, but pleasant, stay at Macao, the
Grahams went on to Canton.[157]

"The last place but one," Sybil could not help
whispering to Leonard on board. "When we next
arrive&mdash;" she went on, but tears starting into her eyes
seemed to drown the rest of the sentence. However,
as some very happy weeks had yet to be passed at
Canton, neither she nor we must anticipate. A long
visit of two months was to be spent here at the residence
of a personal friend of Mr. Graham, the English
consul of the place.

A servant was stationed on the steps leading round
to the Consulate, or Yamen, to await the arrival of
Mr. and Mrs. Graham and their children.

This house was situated on a height, and occupied
the site of an ancient palace. It consisted of a suite of
buildings, surrounded on one side by a pretty garden,
and on the other by a park, in which deer grazed.
Both Sybil and Leonard thought the deer very pretty;
and quite near to the Yamen was a pagoda of nine
storeys, which the Emperor Wong-Ti, who reigned about
the middle of the sixteenth century, is supposed first to
have constructed.

"How little," Sybil and Leonard said to one
another, "we ever thought, when we examined our
little ornamental pagodas at home, that we should ever
live quite near to a real one!"

A story relating to this pagoda, being told to
Leonard, interested him a good deal.



THE ENGLISH CONSULATE AT CANTON.


In 1859 some English sailors climbed up the old
building, which was then in so tottering a condition
that it was a really perilous ascent, and when they
reached the top the Chinese were dreadfully angry, for
two reasons: first, because they looked upon it as
sacrilege; and secondly, because from the height the[159]
sailors could look down upon their houses, and the
Chinese dislike very much indeed to be overlooked,
especially by "barbarians."

The consul and Leonard were soon very good friends,
and the elder friend very kindly did not weary of
answering questions put to him by the little boy.

"Why is your house called a yamen?"

"This word means the same as does consulate, the
official residence of the consul."

"What are you here for?"

The consul smiled. "To protect your interests and
those, commercial and otherwise, of every English citizen
resident here."

"Who is that Jui-Lin of whom you have a picture?
and is he alive now?"

"He died a few years ago, and was viceroy of
Canton. He made so good a governor that those
provinces over which he ruled generally prospered
under his administration. It is in a great measure
through his influence that peaceable relations have,
for some time, been established between China and
foreign countries. The Emperor Tau-Kwang, who
came to the throne in 1820, thought so well of him
that he made him one of his ministers. Later he became
general of the Tartar garrison at Canton, and soon
after he was made viceroy. He established order in
a very troublesome district, where he made the clan
villagers at last acknowledge some authority, and
so put the people and their property in much greater
security."



JUI-LIN, LATE VICEROY OF CANTON.


Leonard said Canton was the place for him, for here
he saw ships and fishing to perfection. In Canton alone,
the consul told him, it was estimated that 300,000[161]
persons had their homes on the water. One Canton
boat-woman, in whose passenger-boat they travelled,
said that her husband went on shore during the day to
work, whilst she looked after the passengers; but he
seemed to be rather an exception, for most of the boat
population never went on shore at all, and as people on
land go to market to buy vegetables and other food, so
everything in this line, that they required, was brought,
by boat, to them. Then, besides boats, there were floating
islands, on which people lived, and these consisted
of rafts of bamboos fastened together, with a thick bed of
vegetable soil covering the rafts. Here the owners set
up houses, cultivated rice-fields, and kept tame cattle
and hogs. Swallows and pigeons here built their nests
in pretty surrounding gardens. Sails were put up on
the houses, and oars were often used to propel the
islands along. Women worked them frequently, with
their babies fastened to their backs; and little boys and
girls would here also play together, having smaller
brothers and sisters thus attached to them. These floating
islands, Sybil and Leonard were told, were to be
seen on almost all Chinese lakes. Many floating
houses were moored to one another.

Sometimes the boat population made such a noise.
They seemed a good-natured set of people, but every
now and then they quarrelled, and this was done very
noisily. Then if a storm came on, they would call
out with fear. Those people who lived in river streets,
where their houses were close against the river, often
complained of the noise that they heard during the
night. The boat population are often looked down
upon by the Chinese who live on land, and may not
go in for the literary examinations.[162]

There were very many fishing villages about,
and nothing made Leonard happier than to be taken
to one or another of them; he was so fond of boats
of all kinds. Fishing-boats in China had to obtain a
license from Government. Some of these sailed two
and two abreast, at a distance, from one another, of
about three hundred feet, when a net was stretched
from ship to ship to enclose the fish. Names cut in
the boats had generally reference to good fortune. The
name on one, which Leonard had interpreted for him,
was "Good Success."



CHINESE BOAT-WOMAN.




A FISHING VILLAGE ON THE CANTON RIVER.


In fishing as well as in other villages men go
about hawking things for sale, and carrying them, by
ship, from one village to another. In the bows of[163]
fishing vessels are large pairs of shears, which can be
either raised or lowered. A large dip-net, fastened to
the shears, is drawn up after remaining some time in
the water, when the fish it contains are emptied into
a little hole in the middle of the ship, like a large
cistern, into which fresh water flows. The fishermen
anchor their boats, and then lower their dip-nets into
the water by means of these shears, which are made
of bamboo, and attached to wooden platforms, resting[164]
on posts. Huts are sometimes erected near the dip-nets,
so that the fishermen can shelter themselves from
the hot sun. A great deal of fishing with birds called
cormorants is also carried on in China, when one man
will, perhaps, take out a hundred birds to fish for him,
fastening something to their throats to prevent them
from swallowing the fish when caught. As they return
with them, they are given a little piece that they
can swallow.

After young fish are caught, they are fed with paste
in the tanks, or wells, into which they are put,
and when they grow older little ponds are made for
them.

Sybil and Leonard were taken very often on the
Canton river in all kinds of boats, both large and
small. In the stern of very many was an altar, concealed
generally behind a sliding door, but which, night
and morning, was drawn aside to admit the altar to
view, and display the images of household gods that
were upon it.

Here were also small ancestral tablets, which were
regularly worshipped, and offerings of fruit and flowers
were constantly offered to the guardian god of the boat
and the tablets when they were worshipped. Tien-How,
Queen of Heaven, also called Ma-chu, and other names, is
much worshipped by sailors, but each boat has its special
guardian god. Incense is burnt night and morning at the
bow of the boat. The Grahams very often travelled in a
small ship called a sampan, which had a mat roofing
over the centre, and was driven forward, very frequently
by women, with two oars and a scull.



CHINESE FISHING.


"I have seen just the sort of thing for you to sketch,
mother," Sybil said one day. Like her mother, she[165]
greatly admired what was beautiful, and now, with
her fellow-excursionists, the consul, her father, and
brother, returned home, from a ramble, very tired; "a
dear little pagoda, seven storeys high, very near to the
banks of the river, with mountains at the back and
trees near to it, and a little village in the distance; and
on the opposite side of the river we saw two men and a[166]
boy: the boy seemed to have a kite, but we thought it
belonged to one of the men, and he was just carrying it
for him."

Mrs. Graham sometimes did not feel equal to long
expeditions, of which her children never grew tired, so
then she would remain at home, or walk through the
pretty gardens and park.

The Canton, Chu-kiang, or Pearl River, has a great
many names and branches. The great western branch
is called Kan-kiang, the northern branch Pe-kiang,
or Pearl River, and the eastern one Tong-kiang. On
the western branch the children found themselves surrounded
by lovely mountain scenery. From Canton to
Whampoa it was called the Pearl River; from Whampoa
to Bocca Tigris, or Tiger's Mouth, Foo-mon; and beyond
Shek-moon towards Canton, the Covetous River. The
passage to Macao was the Wild Goose River. It was
some time before Sybil and Leonard could understand
anything at all about these divisions.

One day, on the Pearl River, they came to a very
pretty spot, where the water was almost entirely land-locked
by high ranges of hills, and here they asked to
be allowed to remain stationary, for a little while, to look
about them.

Another day they went very far indeed with their
father and mother, crossing the Fatchan River, where
Leonard heard, with interest, that Commodore Keppel
engaged in a memorable battle in 1857. The river
divides the town of Fatchan into two equal parts. Then
again they went so far that they could not even think
of returning home the same day, and stayed the night
on the road to a village called Wong-tong, which was
very countrified and pretty.[167]



PAGODA ON THE BANKS OF THE CANTON RIVER.


And once more they went&mdash;father, mother, and all&mdash;to
a place quite different from anything that they had yet
seen, which was the village of Polo-Hang. Here they
found themselves in the midst of vast plains, on the outskirts
of which were to be seen lovely-looking hills of
limestone and rows of wonderfully-shaped mountains.
Standing on one of these mountains, they had a capital
view of the Temple of Polo-Hang and its surroundings,
consisting of bare fields traversed by canals; and, at the
foot of the mountains of thickets of bamboo, whose light,
feathery branches swayed gently to and fro. Bamboo
was very largely cultivated here, and Sybil thought it
such a fairy-like growth. Must not this scene have
been very lovely? Sybil was so glad that her mother[168]
had come to see it. Then other hills appeared, covered
with trees, and dotted here and there with temples.

"Where did they all come from?" Leonard asked.

Mr. Graham was looking very serious. This was
a scene calculated to leave a deep impression upon the
beholders.



ON THE CANTON RIVER


"From the hand of God," he said very quietly.



VILLAGE OF POLO-HANG IN CANTON.


A week later, Sybil wrote again to her friend.



"Canton, January, 1881.


"My Dearest Lily,&mdash;We saw such a strange sight
yesterday; and we could not help liking to see it, although,
of course, it was very dreadful. We went inside[170]
a Buddhist temple at Canton. These temples are often
called joss-houses; this one was the Temple of Five
Hundred Gods. Fancy five hundred gods! and these
idols were all there, arranged in different lines. They
all seemed to look different, and some were dreadfully
ugly. I saw beards on a few of their faces. In the
part of the temple where, in a church, our altar would
be, there was a terrible-looking thing: I suppose a very
special god.

"We saw one of the priests. He had his beads in
one hand, and a fan in the other. Some of the priests
are men who have committed great crimes, and have
escaped to a monastery and had their heads shaved, so
as not to be caught and punished.

"Some of the idols were as large as if they were alive,
and they had their arms in all sorts of different positions.
Some held beads, and a few wore crowns; I think they
were disciples of Buddha. The buildings of the temple,
and the houses of the priests, were surrounded by lakes
and gardens.

"We have been able to get you a picture of part of
the inside of the temple, so I send it to you; but
Leonard says that he thinks as you'll have the picture
(and he considers it a very good one) that you ought to
know that this temple is said to have been founded
about 520 years a.d., and to have been rebuilt in 1755.
Fancy people wasting prayers before these images!
Isn't it a pity that they don't know better? There are
more than 120 temples, or joss-houses, in Canton.



THE TEMPLE OF THE FIVE HUNDRED GODS, CANTON.


"The Chinese never eat with knives and forks, but
with chop-sticks. These are generally small square
pieces of bamboo, as large as a penholder, which they
hold between the thumb and first finger of the[172]
right hand. I can't eat with them at all, nor can
mother; and the other day, when she went out to
lunch with some Chinese ladies, they sent for a knife
and fork for her.

"Chinese ladies in Canton never seem to be with
their husbands in public, and they never walk in the
streets with them. Some of them think us such
barbarous people because we are so different from what
they are.

"The Chinese have such a funny way of paying
formal visits, that I think I must tell you about it.
They often go in sedan-chairs. Officers of the highest
rank may have eight bearers, people of less rank have
four, and ordinary people two. The state sedan-chair of
an official is covered with green cloth, and the fringe on
the roof and window-curtains has to be green too. So
much seems to go by rank in China. For the first three
ranks, the tips of poles may be of brass, in the form
of a dragon's head; the fourth and fifth rank would
have a lion's head. On the top of these chairs is a ball
of tin. Leonard and I can tell the chairs very well now.
Private gentlemen have blue cloth, and the ends of their
poles are tipped with plain brass.



AN OFFICIAL&#39;S PALANQUIN.


"Father says when an official calls upon another
official in Peking, his servant sends in his visiting card.
The official who is being called upon then sends out to
know how his visitor is dressed, and if he hears that it
is in full costume, he dresses himself in the same way,
and then goes to the entrance of the house, and asks his
visitor to get out of his carriage or chair, and come in.
As they pass through a door of the gate, the gentleman,
to whom the house belongs asks the visitor to go first,
but he always says 'No' until he has been asked three[174]
times, and then he walks first to the reception-hall, when
the two stop again, and ask one another to go first.
When they have come into the hall, father says, they
kneel down, and knock their heads on the ground six
times. This is performing the kow-tow. When they
get up from this performance, the host arranges a chair
for the other, and asks him to sit down, but he must not
do this even till he has bowed again. I am sure I
should forget when I had to make all these bows, and
should be sure to do them at the wrong times.

"After they have had a little talk, a servant is told
to make some tea. I suppose the host would then say
'Yam-cha' to the other, for this means 'Drink tea.'
Before either gentleman drinks, both bow again, and
soon afterwards the visitor gets up, and says, 'I want to
take my leave.' They walk together to the grand
entrance, but at every door-way the visitor has to bow,
and ask his friend not to come any farther, although of
course he must go, or it would not be polite. And then
he stands at the entrance door till the carriage has
driven off. The Chinese do bow so often, and little
children have to do it too.

"The consul told Leonard that when school-boys go
to see their masters, they have to arrange the chair-cushions
for their masters and themselves. The boy
has to stand outside the visitor's hall till his master
comes, and when he has been asked to go in, he gives
him for a present a tael of silver, about 2s. 8d., which
he holds up with both his hands. Then he looks towards
the north, kneels, and knocks his head twice
upon the ground, when the master bows. The boy
asks how his teacher's parents are, who also asks after
the boy's. He then invites his little guest to sit down;[175]
but every time the boy is asked a question by his
teacher he has to stand up to answer it. When he
leaves, he goes to the entrance door by himself. At
school, the boys have to make a bow to the schoolmaster
whenever they go in and out of the room.

"You asked me in your letter if people have very
many servants in China. Some have a very great
number. Ordinary Chinese gentlemen might have a
porter, two or three footmen, coolies for house-work,
sedan-chair bearers, and a cook. Women servants are
often bought by their masters. A rich man will have
sometimes twenty or thirty slaves. People called 'go-betweens'
generally buy them for the masters. We
have very few servants of our own now, as we are on a
visit. Mother's maid shows dear little Chu what to do.
Female slaves attend upon the ladies and children, and
we have often seen them carrying their mistresses with
small feet. It does look so funny. In good families,
father says, they are very well treated, but some maid-of-all-work
slaves often run away because they are so
unhappy.

"Children are sometimes stolen to be slaves.
Great-grandsons of slaves can buy their freedom. I am
so glad I have my little Chu, because she cannot be
bought or sold now: father made that agreement. I
should not know nearly so much about the servants
and slaves if I had not wanted to know what might
have become of little Chu if we had not had her.
Sometimes servants stand in the streets to be hired.

"In a suburb of Canton, in a street called the Taiping
Kai, we saw one morning a number of bricklayers,
journeymen, and carpenters, waiting to be hired. The
carpenters stand in a line on one side, and bricklayers[176]
on the other. Father said they had been there since
five o'clock.

"Another day we saw men carrying baskets, in which
they were collecting every bit of paper they could
find about the streets, which had been written upon.
The Chinese have such respect for every little piece of
paper, on which have been any Chinese characters,
that they will not allow any parcels even to be wrapped
up in them. When all these scraps have been collected,
they are burnt in a furnace, and the ashes are put
into baskets, carried in procession, and emptied into
a stream. Slips of paper are pasted on walls, telling
people to reverence lettered paper. Chinese characters are
called 'eyes of the sage;' and some people think that if
they are irreverent to the paper, they are so to the sages
who invented them, and they will perhaps, for a punishment,
be born blind in the next world.


WAITING TO BE HIRED.


"Men become famous in China when they write
very beautifully. They write with a brush and Indian
ink. Father's teacher says there are three styles of
writing Chinese characters, and that the literature of
China is the first in Asia. A Chinaman writes from
right to left, and all the writing consists of signs or
characters. I cannot think how Chinese people understand
either their writing or their conversation. One
word will mean a number of things, and you know
which word they mean by the sound of the voice
and the stress on the word. Leonard asked the teacher
one day what soldier was in Chinese, and he said,
'ping;' but he also told him that 'ping' meant
ice, pancake, and other words too. 'Fu' is father,
and 'Mu' mother. They think we have no written
language.[177]

"Canton is entered by twelve outer, and four inner,
gates. The name means 'City of Perfection.' Leonard
and I are now going for a walk, with father, to the
Street of Apothecaries, and to-morrow we are to see a
bridal procession.


"There are such a number of narrow streets in
Canton, and religious worship is carried on in the
open streets, in front of shrines; and before the
shops lighted sticks, called 'joss-sticks,' are put at dawn
and sunset. The natives live in the narrow streets.[178]
Those in the European settlement, where we are, are
larger.

"The ports, which are open to foreign commerce,
have European parts where the European inhabitants
live.


"Always your affectionate
"Sybil Graham."

CHAPTER X.

A BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM.







HE Street of Apothecaries
was no exception to the
general rule that Sybil
had laid down. It also was very narrow, and, like
many other streets in Canton, was so covered over at
the top that in walking through it the sun did not burn
too fiercely, neither did the rain fall upon the passers-by.

The shops opened right upon the street, which was
very gay indeed with sign-boards. Just in front of
the shops were granite counters, on which goods were
shown to purchasers.

Many of the sign-boards rested on granite pedestals.
On one side of each shop was a little altar, dedicated to
the god of wealth, or the god supposed to preside over
the special trade carried on within. Every heathen
Chinese merchant and shopkeeper has some little spot
set apart for this worship, although all the shops have
not an altar, but many only a piece of red paper pasted
upon a wall, on which the characters meaning "god of
wealth" are written, and before which incense and
candles are burnt. Every day, as soon as the shop
is opened, worship is paid to this divinity.[180]



THE STREET OF APOTHECARIES, CANTON.
[181]

The counters and shelves inside these hongs were
very handsome. The accountant's desk was at the end
of the hong, and here again the red colour was not
absent, for the scales and weights of the shop were
covered with cloth of that hue.

Beggars (some miserably and scantily dressed) are
very numerous in China, people making quite a
profession of begging, when they visit shops in companies,
and there make a great disturbance until they
receive what they demand. These beggars are often
governed by a head-man, who was really first appointed
to rule over them by the mandarin, to save
himself trouble. A head-man will sometimes make an
agreement with a hong proprietor, that if he will pay
a sum of money down beggars shall not molest him;
and when he agrees to this, a notice on red paper,
stating the arrangement made, is hung up in the shop,
after which any native beggar applying for aid can be
shown this, turned out of the hong, and upon refusing to
go, he can be beaten. But unless such an arrangement
has been made, beggars may neither be beaten nor
turned out of a shop, whatever annoyance they may offer,
unless they steal, or break some other law. Therefore
it is that poor shop-keepers feel themselves bound to
pay money in order to avoid such annoyance. When
the head-man is paid a sum of money, he is supposed
to divide it amongst his band.

"I never heard such a shame!" Leonard exclaimed,
when he saw one of these beggars very troublesome
in the Street of Apothecaries, and heard the law with
regard to them. "I wish I were a mandarin. I'd
very soon put a stop to poor shop-keepers being so
persecuted."[182]



A BEGGAR.




That evening both
Sybil and Leonard, feeling
tired, went very early to
bed, as they wanted to
be up in very good time
in the morning, so as to
see the whole of the bridal
procession, for the bridegroom
sends very early
indeed in the morning
for his bride. The bridal-chair
which he sends for
her is often painted red.
The one which the Grahams
saw was of this
colour, and over the door
were also strips of red
paper. Before the bride
took her seat in the sedan,
which was brought into
the reception-room of her
home for her, she having
eaten nothing that morning,
and having kow-towed
very often to her
parents, they covered her
head and face with a thick
veil, so that she could not
be seen. The floor, from
her room to the sedan, was
covered with red carpet.
When in the sedan, four
bread-cakes were tossed[183]
into the air by one of the bridesmaids as an omen
of good fortune. In front of the procession two
men carried large lighted lanterns, having the family
name of the bridegroom, cut in red paper, and pasted on[184]
them. Then came two men bearing the family name of
the bride, who were, however, only to go part of the
way. Other men followed, some carrying a large red
umbrella, others torches, and again some playing a band
of music. Near the bridal-chair brothers or friends of
the bride walked. Half-way between the two houses
the friends of the bridegroom met the bride, and as they
approached the procession stopped.


BRIDESMAIDS

The children were very much interested in watching
what happened next. The bride's friends brought out a
large red card, on which was written the bride's family
name, and the other party produced a similar one, bearing
that of the bridegroom. These were exchanged with
bows. The two men at the head of the procession then
walked, with their lanterns, between the sedan-chair and
the lantern-bearers, who carried the bride's family name,
and returned to their places in front, when the bride's
party turned round and went back to her father's house,
carrying home her family name, she being supposed to
have now taken that of her husband. Even her
brothers went back also, and then the band played a
very lively air whilst the rest of the procession took her
on.

Fireworks were let off along the road, and a great
many outside the bridegroom's door when the bride
arrived. Her bridesmaids, who have to keep with her
throughout the day, accompanied the procession.

As the sedan-chair was taken into the reception-room,
the torch-bearers and musicians stayed near the
door, and where it was put down the floor was again
covered with red carpet. The bridegroom then came
and knocked at the bridal door, but a married woman
and a little boy, holding a mirror, asked the bride to get[185]
out. Her bridesmaids helped her to alight. The mirror
was supposed to ward off evil influences.



BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM.


Sometimes, much for the same purpose, a bride is
carried over a charcoal fire on a servant's back, but this[186]
was not done on this occasion. All this time the bride's
face was hidden by her veil. She was then taken into a
room, where the bridegroom was waiting for her, and here
they sat down together for a few minutes, without speaking
a word. Sometimes the bridegroom sits on a high
stool, while the bride throws herself down before him, to
show that she considers man superior to woman.

He then went into the reception-room, where he
waited for his bride to come to worship his ancestral
tablets with him. A table was put in front of the room,
on which were two lighted candles and lighted incense.
Two goblets, chop-sticks, white sugar-cocks, and other
things were on the table, when the bride and bridegroom
both knelt four times, bowing their heads towards the
earth. This was called "worshipping heaven and earth."
The ancestral tablets were on tables at the back, on
which were also lighted candles and incense. Turning
round towards the tablets, they worshipped them eight
times, and then facing one another, they knelt four
times.

Wedding wine was now drunk, and the bride and
bridegroom ate a small piece from the same sugar-cock,
which was to make them agree.

The thick veil was now taken off the bride, but her
face was still partly hidden by strings of pearl hanging
from a bridal coronet.

It often happens that the bridegroom now sees his
bride for the first time, the two fathers having perhaps
planned the marriage, asked a fortune-teller's advice,
sent go-betweens to make all the necessary arrangements,
chosen a lucky day, without the bride or bridegroom
having a voice in the matter. This was the case
with the young couple, a great part of whose wedding[187]
ceremony Sybil and Leonard had witnessed. Both
Chinese boys and girls marry sometimes when they are
sixteen years of age; these were very little older.

Many other ceremonies had to take place, such
as kneeling very often before the bridegroom's parents,
when at last it was time for the bride's heavy outer
garments to be taken off, together with her head-dress,
so that her hair could be well arranged; but she was not
allowed to eat anything at all at the wedding dinner.
Indeed, on her wedding-day, she is hardly expected to
touch food at all.

Many people came in to see her, and on this day
she must be quite natural, and wear no rouge at all.
She has to stand up quietly to be looked at, blessed, and
have remarks made upon her appearance. Presents are
sent to the bridegroom's family. For three days the
bride's parents send her food, as she may not, during
that time, eat what her husband provides. In some
districts of the province of Canton the bride leaves her
husband, and goes home again for a time after she is
married, but after marriage she is generally considered
to belong almost entirely to her husband's family, in a
wing of whose house she lives with him, and to whose
parents she is supposed to help him to be filial. On
many other days the ancestral tablets have to be
worshipped by the bride and bridegroom, and amongst
other gods and goddesses, those of the kitchen have
adoration paid to them.



AT A CHINESE FARM.



"Canton, February, 1881.


"My Dearest Lily.&mdash;Father took us to a lovely
farm the other day" (Sybil wrote in another letter),
"where we saw a little donkey, who was so well cared
for that he seemed like one of the family. Leonard and[189]
I fed him for some time. We both thought that the
farm-house was something like a Swiss cottage.
Father said the walls were made of clay, and on these
walls were scrolls, which were supposed to have power
to keep the fox and wild cat away.

"There were a few bullocks and cows here, but not
many; their stalls were quite near to the house. We
liked the village, to which we went, very much, and it
was surrounded by high trees. Father says that the
stables of the Chinese are like cart-sheds, but each
stable has an altar in honour of the ruler of horses.
In this city there is a large temple to this god.

"We saw a number of bean, pea, rice, and cotton-fields,
and had some sugar-cane given us to eat.
Sugar-cane is grown in Canton, and we had some bean-curds
to drink. We liked them very much. Mother
says she was told that they were made in Canton overnight,
and generally sold very early in the morning.
The beans are ground to flour, which is strained, and
then boiled slowly for an hour. I wonder if you would
like it?

"The Chinese are so fond of sugar-cane, and it grew
in China before it grew anywhere else. Ever so many
fruits and vegetables grow also in China, but there
seem to be more rice-fields than any other. I will
tell you a few of the vegetables: sweet potatoes, yams,
tomatoes, cabbages, lettuces, turnips, and carrots; and
some fruits are apricots, custard-apples, rose-apples,
dates, oranges, pomegranates, melons, pumpkins, and
ever so many others. Canton is in the tropics, but
it is not hot here in the winter. There are such pretty
water-lilies here, not only white, but also red and red-and-white.
The Chinese look upon this lily as a sacred[190]
plant. Some shop-keepers use the leaves, in which to
wrap up things, instead of paper.

"Chinese people do very funny things. Because they
think that their birds sometimes like change of air,
they carry their cages out of doors with them for a
walk. But I do so wish that they did not eat dogs!
You see them being sold in the shops, and in one district
of Canton a fair is held, where they are regularly sold
for food. Many people like black dogs best. At the
beginning of summer nearly everybody eats dog's flesh,
when a ceremony takes place. If people eat it, they
think that it will keep them from being ill in the summer.
I am glad, for that reason, that I shall not be
here in June, as the dogs are cruelly beaten the day
before they are killed. Fancy, poor little things! I
suppose that is to bring luck too! And yet the Cantonese
think that they displease the gods when they eat
dog's flesh, and we have seen it written on Buddhist
temples that people ought not to eat 'their faithful
guardians.'

"The Cantonese must not go into a temple to worship
till they have been three whole days without eating
any dog. One of the 'boys' here&mdash;he is a footman; but
in China all these sort of people are called 'boys'&mdash;eats
rats. He says he is getting bald, and if he eats them
his hair will grow again. Horses are sometimes eaten
too; and worms that spoil the rice-fields, father told me,
are sent to the markets and sold to be eaten. Isn't that
nasty? And a kind of swallow's nest is eaten even by
ladies. It is lined with feathers, which are first removed;
then it is scraped, washed, and pulled to pieces,
when it looks white. People say it is something like
blancmange. I should not like to eat it. Does it not[191]
seem greedy, when people have so much to eat, to take
poor little birds'-nests which have been made with such
pains by their owners?

"There is a bird in China that has such a long tail: it
is called the Golden Pheasant. The feathers of the cock
bird are most beautiful. His throat and breast are like
purple velvet, and his back looks like gold. The upper
part of his very long tail is scarlet, and the rest yellow.
When this pheasant lifts his head and neck-feathers he
shows such a tuft!

"There are a good many deer in China, which are
also supposed to bring good fortune. Some Chinese are
very cruel to animals. We have seen them carrying
pigs, ducks, and geese fastened to a pole, hanging with
their heads downwards; and some of their dogs look so
hungry, and their beasts of burden so tired. We saw a
dreadful thing one day, almost too dreadful to write
about&mdash;a poor little dog running yelping through the
streets with its tail cut off! A Taouist priest had cut
it off, so that it should run screaming through all the
house in which evil spirits were supposed to be, because
this would drive them out; then the poor little dog
rushed into the streets, where we saw it, and, fortunately,
father was near enough to have it killed at once.


CHINESE LADIES.

"The people listen more to father than they do to
many missionaries, because he goes to the dispensary and
helps to cure them when they are ill.

"I forgot to tell you that when we first went to
the farm nobody saw us, because the farmer, his wife,
daughter, and a labourer were all listening to a man
reading to them. We thought he must have got hold
of some of the Chinese classics. The pigeon-English
people talk sometimes is so funny. They are so fond[192]
of the word 'piecee.' Instead of 'one child,' they say
'one piecee chilo;' and if they had many children, I
expect they would say 'piecee muchee.'

"Leonard makes very good shots at pigeon-English,
and can talk it much better than I can. What we
generally do is to put 'ee' at the end of our words;
but when we spoke to the farmer he could not understand,
and so said, 'You talkee me. Very good
talkee.' When he wanted to tell us that his house was
very large, he said, 'Number one largee, handsome
howsow;' and for 'There is a child up-stairs,' he said,
'Have got chilo topside.'

"You asked me how the Chinese dressed, so I must
try to tell you this, although I have written you such a
long letter already.





A VILLAGER.




A COOLIE.


"Gentlemen and ladies seem to dress very much
alike; and people cannot change their clothes as they
choose, because there is a minister of ceremonies, who
says of what colour, stuff, and shape things are to be
made, and when winter and summer things are to be
changed. Even a head-dress may not be altered as
people like, or they might be breaking a law. And it
is so funny about the nails; some people let some of
their nails grow as long as they can, and are so proud
when they are very long. No Chinaman wears a beard
till he is forty. The outside robe of a gentleman is so
long that it reaches to his ankles, and it is fastened with
buttons. The sleeves are first broad, and then get
narrower and narrower. A sash is tied round his
waist, and from this chop-sticks, a tobacco-case, fans,
and such-like things hang. The head-dress is a cap
with a peak at the top. Men do not take off their
hats to bow; indeed, they would put them on if they[194]
were off. In-doors they wear silk slippers, pointed and
turned up at the toes. Chinese men are admired when
they are stout, and women when they are thin. Women
also have two robes, the top one often being made of
satin, and reaching from the chin to the ground. Their
sleeves are so long that they do instead of gloves. They
always wear trousers, and often carry a pipe, for women
smoke a great deal in China. Some, I think, are
pretty. They have rather large eyes and red lips.[195]
Old ladies wear very quiet clothes. Mother says the
Chinese are not at all clean people, and ought to change
their clothes much oftener than they do. People wear
shoes of silk, or cotton, with thick felt soles. The women
spend hours having their hair done into all sorts of
shapes, such as baskets, bird-cages, or anything they and
their amahs can manufacture. Then besides ornaments
in their hair, they wear ear-rings and bangles. Even
boat-women wear these; and the ladies almost always[196]
paint their faces, to do which they have a kind of
enamel. Chinese ladies have little useful occupation,
and spend a great part of their time, mother says, when
they are not doing embroidery, in gambling and adorning
themselves.

"The peasants wear a coarse linen shirt, covered by
a cotton tunic, with thin trousers fastened to the ankles.
In wet and cold weather they make a useful covering
of net-work, into which are plaited rushes, or coarse
dry grass, and they put on very large hats, made in the
same way. The Chinese are not at all lazy people,
for father says after their shutters are shut, and all
looks dark from the outside, they are often at work,
and they get up early too. When men grow old their
tails get so thin. I saw such a wrinkled old man the
other day, with hardly any tail at all. I think he must
have been very sorry about that; he was an old villager.

"Coolies wear their tails twisted round their heads.
They do all the heavy work, and are porters, common
house labourers, and sedan-chair bearers.

"Leonard says if I write any more stuff he is sure
you will not read it; but I hope you will think it
interesting stuff, at all events, and, therefore, not mind
my letter being so long. There seems to be so much
to tell you when you have not been to China, and it
seems selfish to keep all the pleasure of seeing such
new things to myself. I meant to tell you about the
New Year, which we have just kept, but I have not
room. I hope you will write to me very soon. We all
send love to you, and


"Believe me,
"Your very affectionate friend,
"Sybil Graham."


[197]








CHAPTER XI.

PROCESSIONS.








 &nbsp; FORTNIGHT later Mr.
Graham saw a large,
Leonard a small, portion
of a funeral procession, and Sybil
was very anxious afterwards to
hear all about it, for Leonard had
told her that it seemed even grander than the marriage
one.

"Please, father," she said, "tell me all that the
Chinese do when anybody dies."

"I do not think I could tell you all," was her
father's reply, "because it would take too long, and
I do not know all myself; but I dare say I can tell you
quite enough to satisfy your curiosity. When a
Chinese thinks that a relation is likely to die soon,
he places him, with his feet towards the door, on a
bed of boards, arranging his best robes and a hat, or
cap, quite close to him, that he may be dressed in[198]
these just before he dies. It would be considered a
dreadful thing if he were to die without putting them
on. Soon after he is dead, a priest&mdash;usually a priest
of Taou&mdash;is called in to ask the spirit to make haste
to Elysium, and to cast the man's horoscope, so as to
see how far the spirit has got on its journey."

"What does casting his horoscope mean?"

"Finding out the hour of a man's birth, and then
foretelling events by the appearance of the heavens.
More clothes are then put upon the dead man, who,
if he be a person of rank, would wear three silk robes.
Gongs are beaten, and when the body is placed in its
coffin, every corner of the room is beaten with a
hammer, to frighten away bad spirits. A crown is
also put on any person of rank. Widows and children,
to show their grief, sit on the floor instead of
on chairs for seven days, and sleep on mats near to
the husband and father's coffin. On the seventh day
letters are written to friends, informing them of the
death, when they send presents of money to help to
defray the funeral expenses. I saw a very strange
letter of thanks yesterday, a copy of which had been
sent to each giver of a present, and besides money,
food is sometimes given or priests are sent. The
letter, as far as I can remember, ran thus: 'This is
to express the thanks of the orphaned son, who weeps
tears of blood, and bows his head; of the mourning
brother, who weeps and bows his head; of the mourning
nephew, who wipes away his tears and bows his
head.' Then a letter is also written to the departed,
and burnt, that it may reach him, whilst cakes and
other presents are also sent to him by means of burning.



MEN ENGAGED TO WALK IN FUNERAL PROCESSIONS.


"On the twenty-first day after death a banquet[200]
is prepared in honour of the spirit, which is supposed,
on that day, to come back to his home, when the
entrance doors are shut, for fear any one should come
in and vex the spirit. On the twenty-third day three
large paper birds are put on high poles in front of
the house, to carry the soul to Elysium; and for
three days Buddhist priests pray to the ten kings of
Buddhist hell to hasten the flight of the departed
soul to the Western Paradise.

"The coffin is kept in the house for seven weeks,
where an altar is set up, near to which the tablet and
portrait of the deceased are put. Banners, which are looked
upon as letters of condolence, are fixed upon the walls,
and on these the merits of the dead man are inscribed.

"Pictures of the three Buddhas are also to be seen
in the house. A lucky place and day have then to be
fixed, by fortune-tellers, for the burial, and should these
not be forthcoming, the coffin would be placed on a
hill till they can be found. Burial is considered of
so much importance, that should a man be drowned
his spirit would be called back into a figure of wood
or paper, and buried with pomp. Before the grave-diggers
begin their work, members of the family
worship the genii of the mountain, and write letters
to these gods, asking them to be so kind as to allow
the funeral to take place."

"But how are these letters made to 'arrive?'"

"They are set on fire and burnt."

"Leonard says he saw a number of people dressed
in white in the procession."

"Those were the relatives in deep mourning,
white, you remember, being the deepest, white and blue
lesser, mourning."[201]



CHE-YIN.
[202]

"And he says he is sure he saw his friend Che-Yin
among the mourners. You know, father, Che-Yin is
really a great friend of Leonard's, though he is so much
older than himself, and now he is taking great trouble
to teach him to play on the musical instrument which
he plays so well himself. I believe if Leonard were
going to stay longer here he would really learn to play
it quite well. Is it not kind of Che-Yin? But I must
not interrupt you any more," Sybil went on, "and this
is so interesting. Leonard said he wondered so much
what could be happening once when he heard a tremendous
noise, and saw people rushing out into the
streets screaming."

"I think I know what that meant," was the
missionary's answer. "On the day of burial the relatives
weep and lament very loudly. They carry a long
white streamer, called a soul-cloth, to the ancestral hall,
for the spirit to say 'Good-bye' to its ancestors. At
three or four o'clock in the morning all decorations,
that have been put up in front of the door, are taken
down, and a banquet is made ready, of which the
spirit is invited to partake. You remember I told you
that they believe one spirit is buried with the body.
Well, some kind of paper is now again burnt, while
the spirit is asked to accompany the body, and the
tablet and portrait of the dead man are put in a
sedan-chair by his eldest son, over the top of which
is a streamer of red satin, on which his name and
titles are written.

"Distant relations remain standing out in the
streets; but I expect what Leonard saw was people
rushing out of the house, dreadfully frightened, for fear
that after all the day might not be lucky, and the[203]
spirit should be vexed, and send trouble to them, in
consequence.

"As the coffin is brought out offerings are also again
presented to the spirit. Two men walk first, carrying
large lanterns, on which are written the name, title,
and age of the man who has died. Then come two
other men with a gong, which they beat from time
to time."

"Leonard heard that."

"Then follow musicians, and behind these some men
walk with flags, others with red boards, on which are
inscribed, in golden letters, the titles of the ancestors of
the deceased."

"Then Leonard saw some gold canopies and sedan-chairs."

"Offerings made to the dead are carried under gilded
canopies, and these canopies also follow the ancestral
tablets. The portrait of the dead man is in one sedan-chair,
and his wooden tablet in another.

"I believe somewhere about here are more musicians,
then comes a man scattering pieces of paper fastened to
tinfoil. This is supposed to be mock-money for hungry
ghosts, the souls of those people who have died at corners
of the streets, and this money is to make peace with
them, so that they shall not injure the soul of the man
now being buried. The eldest son carries a staff, whilst
a person walks on either side to support him."

"But Leonard said he saw a white cock, when he
could not help laughing. What could this be for?"

"The cock is also carried to call the soul to go with
the body. Behind the eldest son comes the bier, carried
by men or drawn by horses.

"Many other persons follow. All the people that can,[204]
go in the procession. Women with small feet, unless
carried on their slaves' backs, can only go a short way.
At the grave, grains of rice are scattered over the coffin,
when the priest and all the people lift the cock and
bend their bodies forward three times. The tablet is
taken out of the chair, on which the nearest relation
makes a mark with a red pencil; then the sons kneel
down, and a priest, if present, addresses them."

"Then a priest is not obliged to go to the funeral?"

"No; sometimes only a man skilled in geomancy is
present. Geomancy is a kind of foretelling things, by
means of little dots first made on the ground and then
on paper. The tablet is marked, I believe, to bring
good luck to the sons, and then every one knocks his
head on the ground and does homage to it."

Sybil was looking very serious, though she was
smiling too.

"Oh, father!" she said, "how much you, and other
missionaries, will have to teach these people! What a
pity it is that they cannot know that the soul is never
buried, and that they can't learn to worship and pray to
God, Who would send them such real happiness in
answer to their prayers!"

"It is indeed, my child," was the missionary's
answer.

"And is anything more done for the dead after
this except worship being paid to them?"

"Yes; for many days feasts are prepared for the
departed relative, hot water is carried to him to wash
his face and hands, and I have also heard of another
way that the Chinese have of 'conveying' spirits to
the kingdoms of Buddhistic hell. Little sedan-chairs
are made of bamboo splints and paper, with four[205]
little paper bearers, and sometimes there is a fifth little
paper man, holding an umbrella. These are burnt like
the paper mock-money; and sometimes, after the death
of another friend, a little paper trunk, full of paper
clothes, is supplied for one already dead, and burnt,
when the senders believe that the person who died last
is conveying this trunk to the other in safety for them."

"They think that people need a great many things
in the other world, then," Sybil said. "And do children
often worship at their parents' tombs?"

"Yes; at certain seasons of the year they make
pilgrimages to the tops of high hills, or to other distant
parts, where they prostrate themselves, this being supposed
to continue the homage and reverence which they
showed to them on earth; and they believe that in a
great measure the happiness of the spirits depends upon
the adoration and worship which they pay to them, whilst
those who render it secure for themselves favour from
the gods. Twice a day do children also pay adoration
to their dead parents, before a shrine set up in the
house to the memory of departed ancestors."

"But what is the use of preparing feasts for the
dead?" Sybil asked. "They cannot think that the
dead really eat the food?"

"They seem to do so, and not only lay a place for
them, but even put chop-sticks for their use."

Another procession Sybil and Leonard saw one day,
and this Sybil described in the last letter that she wrote
to her friend, before she left China. Some men carried
an image of the Dragon King, others carried gongs,
drums, and green and black and yellow and white flags,
whilst boys, walking in the procession, called out loudly
from time to time.[206]

The children could not possibly imagine what this
procession could be all about.

Some characters were written on the flags.

One man who, as Leonard thought, had a very happy,
smiling face, had a pole slung across his shoulders, from
which hung two buckets of water. In his hand he held
a green branch of a shrub which, from time to time, he
dipped in the water, and then sprinkled the ground;
while he also continually called out something. Other
men were carrying sticks of lighted incense. Most of the
people, in the procession, wore white clothes, and white
caps without tassels.



SPRINKLING WATER.


Sybil and Leonard were afterwards told that this
was praying for rain, because for some time there had
been none.

The Dragon King was carried, because he is supposed
to be the god of rain. Besides the Dragon King
there is a River Dragon, who is both feared and worshipped.[207]
His mother, Loong-Moo, is often worshipped
by people engaged in river traffic.

The men and boys were calling out "Rain comes!"
The yellow and white banners were to represent wind
and water, and the green and black, clouds.

The inscription on the flags was, when translated,
"Prayer is offered for rain."






[208]








CHAPTER XII.

THE LAST PEEP.








YBIL had made several
friends amongst Cantonese
ladies and children, and
some very pleasant afternoons
had she spent with them. The
girls, she noticed, generally
wore cotton tunics and trousers.
One little girl, with whom she
had spent a few hours, was in
mourning, so she wore white,
bound with blue. Sybil could
not help thinking that this was
very pretty mourning, but her
brother's was still prettier, for
his trousers were of pale blue silk tied round the ankles,
and he wore white shoes. His cue was tied with blue.
And there were such very pretty gardens belonging to
the houses in which they lived, with rockeries, fish-ponds,
and summer-houses almost large enough to live in.[209]

One lady, whom Sybil visited, astonished her very
much, because she had an only boy, who was very pale-looking
and delicate, and she called him all sorts of
names, and seemed to treat him so unkindly. When
Sybil had been ill herself, her mother had always treated
her with such extra love and care, and she fancied that
all mothers behaved like this. Then the Chinese love
their boys so much, that one would therefore have
thought an only boy would be so very precious. The
next time that she saw the lady she had given away
her child to be adopted by some one else. Mrs.
Graham heard the explanation to this unnatural conduct,
and gave it to Sybil. The woman really loved
her boy most fondly, and would have given anything she
had to have him well, but she fancied that the gods
were malicious towards him, and that if she pretended to
them that she did not care for the child they would let
him get well again. All that conduct was to deceive
the gods.

Mr. Graham had several times dined out at Chinese
houses, and sometimes his wife had accompanied him,
but as Cantonese ladies never dine with their husbands
in public, where her doing so was likely to give any
offence, even though she were invited, she never went;
but many Chinese very well understand that there are
quite different laws for Europeans than there are for them,
and these seemed to be glad to admit English ladies, with
their husbands, to be guests at their houses.

When Mr. and Mrs. Graham went to one of these
dinners, knives and forks were borrowed for them,
and the other English visitors, in place of chop-sticks.
A china spoon and a two-pronged fork were set before
each person, and there were china wine-glasses. The[210]
table-napkins were of brown paper. Basins of fruit,
from which all helped themselves as they liked,
were in the middle of the table. There were a
great many soups and other courses. Every now and
then the host took something out of a basin with his
chop-stick, and offered to put it into the mouths of his
guests. Out of politeness they were bound to accept
these gifts. There was not any beef, as no Chinaman
eats beef. Music was played, and slaves fanned the
people during dinner.

Once when Sybil visited some of her young
Chinese friends, the tea was brought in to them in
covered cups, and when they wanted more, tea-leaves
were put into the cups and boiling water was poured
upon them. She had learnt now to be able to drink tea
without milk or sugar, but she could not like it.

A two months' stay at Canton brought the children
to the end of four months and a half of their stay in
China, and left but six weeks more before they were to
return to England. It was the middle of March when
the Grahams said "Good-bye" to their kind friends
at the Yamen, and returned to Hong-Kong. Sybil
could not bear to say this farewell, as it was the last
but one, and she knew how very quickly six weeks
would pass.

They had all enjoyed their stay in Canton very
much, and often thought about the New Year's Day
which had been kept, while they were there, with such
grand rejoicings. At midnight, on the last day of the
old year, a bell, never used except on this occasion,
pealed forth, when, at the signal, people rushed into
the streets in crowds to let off fireworks.

Every temple and every pagoda was lighted up, and[211]
people burnt incense before idols in their own homes.
Some streets are lighted in Canton by lanterns, but,
as a rule, the smaller streets are in darkness, with
the exception of paper lanterns, which hang, every now
and then, from before shops or private houses, and even
these are put out by half-past nine o'clock. Paraffin lamps
are now being introduced along Chinese city streets.

All New Year's night a great noise was to be heard,
and in the morning friends dressed in their best to
call upon, and salute, one another.

In the streets they were to be seen prostrating themselves
upon the ground. Rich and poor alike had great
rejoicings on New Year's Day, the rich often keeping
up their holiday for ten days.

Latterly Mr. Graham had been several times backwards
and forwards to Hong-Kong, where he had made
his final arrangements.

The missionary, whose place he was about to fill,
would, when he left the island, take with him to
England, besides his own family, Sybil and Leonard
Graham. Until they sailed, the Grahams would all stay
with them at the Mission House, when it would be
handed over to Mr. Graham.

The other missionary had three children of his own,
two daughters, twelve and ten years old, and a son of
nine, but as they had been absent from Hong-Kong
when the Grahams had been there before, the children
had not yet made one another's acquaintance.

The eldest, Katie, now became Sybil's very useful
interpreter, for as she had been born in China and lived
there all her life, she could understand, and speak, many
Chinese dialects.

Sybil now knew several Chinese words herself.[212]
"Che-fan," or "Have you eaten your rice?" was "How
do you do?" though, as a rule, when people said "How
do you do?" to her it was "Chin-chin mississi?"

When she went out visiting, questions such as the
following were generally put to her, "What honourable
name have you?" "What is the name of your beautiful
dwelling?" and "What age have you?" Had she
been grown up, this question would probably have been,
"What is your venerable age?"

Leonard was often told to "catchee plenty chow-chow,"
which means "eat a very good dinner," but as
somehow he generally seemed able to do this, he hardly
needed the kind advice.

Mrs. Graham's amah amused Sybil very much.
She had been a great traveller, having visited both
England and America, and she liked England much the
best. One day she said to Sybil: "Melic&#257; no good
countly. Welly bad chow-chow. Appool number one.
My hab chow-chow sixty pieces before bleakfast. Any
man no got dollar, all hab got paper. Number one
foolo pidgin. No good countly. My no likee Melic&#257;.
My likee England side more better." This meant:
"America is not a good country. It has very bad food,
but first-rate apples. I ate sixty before breakfast. No
one has any dollars there, all use paper money. Very
foolish business. Not a good country. I do not like
America. I like England better."

Some pleasure or another was always forthcoming
for Sybil and Leonard, and the few last "Peep-shows"
were very precious.



&quot;SING-SONG.&quot;


One day, when they were out, they saw a "Sing-Song,"
as the performance was called. Under a canopy,
in the open streets, children were acting and dancing.[214]
To do so, they had dressed up in very gorgeous costumes,
their ornaments and head-dresses being grander,
Leonard said, than anything he had ever seen before;
and the little Chinese actors themselves seemed to be
thoroughly at their ease, and quite at home, in their
grand attire.

"Why did that policeman come after you to-day,
father, and take down the name of the boat that we got
into?" Leonard once asked, when he and his father had
been out together, and were returning home.

"Policemen have done that several times, if you had
only noticed," was the reply. "That was to guard us
from pirates. They took the name of our boat, so that
the owner could be held responsible if we did not return
safely. The Chinese are dreadful pirates, and are
generally on the look-out for opportunities to rob.
Sometimes a band of them will take their passages in a
ship, and when fairly out at sea will all rise in mutiny
against the captain and his officers, and perhaps murder
them, so as to be able to plunder as they choose."

"I should think the boat-policemen had plenty of
work to do," Leonard then said.

"Father, do you remember well when you were just
eleven?" the child then asked suddenly, going, as it
seemed, right away from his present subject. "Did
you ever want to be a sailor then? ever think for
certain you would be one?"

"I do not remember ever having had that wish."

"Well, I have had it over and over again, and
thought that there could not be anything better in the
world than going about in ships, and seeing different
places. I've wished to be a sailor for ever so many
years; but, you know, I don't wish it now."[215]



FISHERMEN AND FISHERWOMEN.
[216]

Mr. Graham smiled. I expect it was Leonard's
"ever so many years" which made him do so.

"Don't you?" his father asked. "Then what do
you want to be now?"

"Something, father, I'm not half good enough for,"
the boy answered, thoughtfully. "A missionary! Oh,
father, I do so want to be a missionary now, and come to
China, as you and grandfather have done! Shouldn't
you like it too? I know mother would; and perhaps
the Church Missionary Society would send me out if I
asked them."

"I should like nothing better, my little son," was
the missionary's reply.

A few minutes later Leonard was out of doors
again, flying himself one of the "wonderful kites,"
which a Chinaman had made for, and given to, him,
and his father was watching his little fellow with
pleasure almost amounting to pride.

Was this his impulsive boy's own thought, he
wondered, or had his sister suggested it to him.

Quite his own; but no doubt the quiet, gentle influence
which Sybil exerted over her younger brother
was very good for him.

"Do you think, Sybil, that the heathen Chinese
could teach the Christian English anything?" Mr.
Graham asked his daughter, as they sat and talked
together the very last evening.

"I am sure they could," she answered quickly;
"many things. Filial love and obedience for one,
respect and reverence for old age for another; and then,
though they do believe such silly, superstitious things,
there seems to be such a reality, so much earnestness,
about the way some of them carry out their religion.[217]
They do not mind how early they get up and go out
to keep a religious festival, and they seem to ask a
sort of blessing, from their gods, on everything they
do, and keep their fasts and feasts so very regularly;
but I think their love for their parents beats
everything. 'Boy' asked for a holiday yesterday,
because it was his mother's birthday, and got up very
early to do his work before he went." "Boy" was a
kind of footman.

"Yes; parents' birthdays are kept up much more
than are those of children. Sometimes on their birthdays
they will sit under a crimson canopy, whilst their
children kneel and perform the 'kow-tow' to them.
The fifty-first birthday, and every ten years afterwards,
is celebrated with great pomp, when religious ceremonies
are often performed at the Temple of Longevity. I
believe thirty Buddhist priests will then sometimes
return thanks for three days.

"When a man is eighty-one, the fact is occasionally
communicated to the Emperor, who may then allow
money to be given for a monumental arch to be erected
to the old man's honour.

"After parents are dead their birthdays are still celebrated
in the ancestral hall, where their portraits hang."

"I suppose children give their parents beautiful
presents on their birthdays?"

"When they begin to get old the best present that
a child can, and does, make a parent, and one which
he values more than anything else, is a coffin, because,
you know, a Chinaman thinks that unless his body be
buried properly his spirit cannot rest.

"The Chinese are strange contradictions," Mr.
Graham went on. "Although they are very courageous[218]
in bearing torture, they are dreadful liars, and a great
liar is generally a great coward. Then they are sober
and industrious, but slaves to the opium drug; meek
and gentle, but, at the same time, treacherous and
cruel; most dutiful to their parents, but often very
jealous of their neighbours; and then, perhaps strangest
of all, is their love towards their children, but yet their
readiness to put their girls to death."

Sybil was silent for several minutes. "Oh, father!"
she then said, "isn't the time dreadfully near now?
Fancy leaving you and dear mother! How can we?"

"You must go to your work, darling, and we must
stay here to do ours. Is it not so?" Mr. Graham asked,
in the dear, kind, soft voice that Sybil loved so much,
and which she always called his "preachy voice." "But
what shall give us comfort? what shall we think about
when we are trying to do our several duties, though
apart, I hope contentedly and well? That it is God
who has called us to our several duties; it is His
Almighty will which we have now and always to obey;
but remember, not alone, not unaided, dear Sybil.
Who will be our guide, stay, and comfort, when we are
separated from one another?"

Sybil knew, but could not answer, because she was
crying.



WOMAN OF POAH-BI.


"Your mother and I," Mr. Graham went on, "in
commending our children to the Fatherly love and care
of Him Who gave you to us, know that we place you in
the safest keeping; and you yourselves have also both
learnt, have you not, how to go to our Father and
'Supreme Ruler' in earnest prayer, whenever tempted
to do what would displease Him? A missionary, you
know, is one who is sent on a mission&mdash;to fulfil a duty.[220]
A missionary's children must not shrink from fulfilling,
must not fail to fulfil, the mission on which they are
sent, must they?"

Sybil looked comforted. She liked this last "Peep-show"
very much, and kissed her father to show him
that she did.

A few minutes later she said, "Do you know,
father, I believe little Chu is really beginning to
believe and understand properly, for the other day,
when I was saying my prayers, she came and knelt
down beside me, and she would never kneel to our God
before, even when she saw the Christian woman at
Poah-bi do so, with whom we stayed, and with whom
she was such good friends. I shall often remember
that woman and her dear little baby, which she tied to
herself so funnily, because I liked them so very much.

"Poor little Chu!" Sybil then went on. "I shall
be so glad to see her again when I come back to you,
but I do not think she will like me to go away."

"Chu will have to be a great deal at school now.
She has her work to do too, you know."

"How I shall think of you, father, and the Hong-Kong
Mission on Intercession Day, when it comes
round, shan't I?"

"Yes, Sybil; and not only on Intercession Day, but
always in your prayers, you must remember to pray
very fervently, both for Chinese and other unbelievers,
and not only for me, but for all who are seeking their
conversion."

"It seems a more real thing now to pray for,"
Sybil said.

"And to give thanks for too. Here in Hong-Kong
we have great cause to be thankful."[221]

"What a dear old lady that was who was baptized
on Sunday! but what was the Christian name she
chose? I could not hear it."

"Mong-Oi, which means 'desiring the love' (of
Jesus)."

"That was a beautiful name, wasn't it? And there
were a number of communicants for here too. How
many native communicants are there in Hong-Kong?"

"Between sixty and seventy; and what is so
comforting is that the communicants seem to be really
devout, and to realise what being a communicant means
for, and requires of, them, and it is no easy matter at
all for natives of China to embrace Christianity.
Sometimes they have to leave all their relations, and
suffer much persecution in consequence."

"When was the Hong-Kong mission begun?"
Sybil asked.

"In 1862."

Although the results were far from what the zealous
missionaries would fain have seen them, Mr. Graham
was right in saying that the Mission from the Church
of England to Hong-Kong had cause to take hope and
be thankful.

Several men and women were now under instruction
both for baptism and confirmation. The mission schools
for boys numbered more than 190, and for girls more
than thirty, and here the children were religiously
as well as secularly instructed.

There were, although only two European missionaries
and one native clergyman, twenty-three native Christian
teachers, and 183 native Christians. The Mission comprised,
besides St. Stephen's Church and the agencies
around it in the island of Hong-Kong, many out-stations[222]
in the province of Quangtung occupied by
native agents.

The Prayer Book, and, still better, the Holy Bible,
translated into their own tongue, were now circulated
among the people, some of whom were really learning to
love and value them; and not only were the services for
the Christians well attended, but every evening the
heathen were to be seen in numbers going to hear
sermons that were to be preached for them.

Well, then, might Mr. Graham go forth to his new
work with hope.

"How much you will have to do, father," Sybil said,
"if you go to the Medical Missionary Institution so
often, and do all your other work besides! But the
people seem to be very grateful to you. 'Boy' said
yesterday that you were 'a hundred man good,' and
I know what that means: 'The best of men.'"

Mr. Graham smiled.

"I like, and it is good for us all," he said, "to have
plenty to do; and one work, you know, may help on
the other."

"I expect mother will help you a very great deal
too."

"She is sure to do that." Sybil knew she was.

All day long the child had spent beside her
much-loved mother; now, for another hour, she sat
on and talked with her father, receiving good,
kind counsel, when Leonard, who had been closeted
with his mother, listening to her dear words of best
advice, came in, with eyes swollen from crying, and
then the four sat together till it was long past bed-time;
but what of that? To-morrow, on board
ship, there would be nothing to keep them up late,[223]
when they could make up for to-night, and go early
to bed.

To-morrow came, as happy and sad to-morrows all
alike will come; when the mother gave her children their
last kisses, the father their last kisses and benedictions,
and Sybil and Leonard Graham started on their homeward
voyage to England, leaving their parents very
grateful for having such good, kind friends to whose
care on board ship to entrust them.

Both children were to return at once to their former
schools, and spend their holidays together at Mrs.
Graham's brother's house, who was also the rector of a
country parish, and where she knew they would very
soon feel quite at home.

Sybil and Leonard Graham, the children of brave
parents, were brave children themselves, and as they had
promised not to grieve more then they could help, they
at once did battle with their tears, and before long
were talking really cheerfully with their friends.

"Who knows," Sybil said once to Leonard, when she
and her brother found themselves alone, "but what they
might come over for a small holiday-trip in two or three
years' time? and if not, I believe when I go out you are
to go with me for another 'Peep-show' holiday, and to
see them!"

"Of course I ought to go whenever I can," Leonard
answered, "as I'm going to be a missionary out there
myself."

Sybil had said "them" because she could not yet
say, without crying, those two dear, sacred words, father
and mother, which stand alone in the vocabulary of
every language, and have no peers.

Mrs. Graham herself was then alone, shedding bitter[224]
tears, which she had stifled until her children left her,
but which she could keep back no longer.

Yet, though her mother's loving heart was very sad
and sore, she would not weep long, but would, to the
very best of her ability, go forth at once to help her
husband&mdash;who could not but feel sad now too&mdash;in the
good work in which she had encouraged him to embark,
counting all the costs beforehand.

And Sybil, who had said "I like my father to be a
missionary very much," would not unsay the words
now, though it took both her parents so far away from
her and Leonard. Oh no! since she had seen the
great need that there was for missionaries to China, she
liked, even better than before, her father "to be a
missionary!"

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
