[1]PREFACE.
TO THE READER, OR RATHER TO THOSE WHO HESITATE
IN BUYING THIS WORK.

"Good wine needs no bush," and, therefore,
little by way of preface is necessary to this Work.
"He who is ignorant of arithmetic," says Archimedes,
"is but half a man." Therefore, for the
sake of manhood, which drapers'-boys and lawyers'-clerks
attempt by means of mustachoes and penny-cigars,
read this Work,       for if the dead abstractions
of this science will make a man, what must the
living realities do?       Nothing less than a Phœnix
D'Orsay, which is at least 1 man ¾ and ⅝.

Read this book, then, my friends, young and
old. It teaches practical philosophy in every
[2]
chapter; wisdom in every page; and common
sense in every line. Get this manual at the
fingers' ends of your mind, and your physical and
mental powers will be so expanded that you will
be able to catch a comet by the tail; take the moon
by the horns; knock down the great wall of China,
à la Cribb; or measure the spectre of the Brocken
for a pair of breeches, and thus cut a pretty
Figure.



[3]FIGURES FOR THE MILLION.
Of Arithmetic and its Importance.

INTRODUCTION.

Arithmetic is the art or science of computing
by numbers. It is national, political, military,
and commercial. It is of the highest importance
to the community; because it pre-eminently
teaches us to take care of Number I. Our ministers
succeed according to their knowledge of the
science of numbers. Witness the skilful management
of majorities of the lower house.

He who understands the true art of Addition,
Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division, as here
laid down, will not be considered a mere cipher in
[4]
the world; but will, in all probability, make a
considerable figure: and in the figurative words of
Horace, be "Dives agris dives positis in fœnore
nummis."

Let us, therefore, under the guidance and protection
of that god of honest men, the light-heeled
and light-fingered Mercury, be diligent so to add
to our store by subtracting from the stores of
others, that we may add to our importance. Let
us so multiply our resources, by encouraging division
among our contemporaries, that we may see
their reduction in the perfection of our own practice.



"Rem facias; rem
Recte si possis, sì non, quocunque
Modo rem."[1]

EXPLANATION OF ARITHMETICAL SIGNS AND
CHARACTERS.


EQUALITY.

"WHO ARE YOU?"

= Equality. The sign of equality: as, "A
living beggar is better than a dead king;" or both
being dead, are equal to each other.


[6]



        Minus, less. The sign of subtraction; as,
for instance, an elopement to Gretna; or, a
knocking-down argument by the way-side,         minus
ticker. Take from         from take.



A PLURALIST.

+ Plus, or more. The sign of addition; as,
3 livings + to 1 = 4; or, 5 millions of new taxes
+ to 48 = 53.


[7]

THE SACRED HALTAR.

× Multiplied by. The sign of multiplication:
as, "The sun breeds maggots in a dead dog."       See
Shakspeare. Or, "Money makes money."       See
Franklin. Or, Anti-Malthus.       See Ireland.



DIVIDING THE CHINESE, A CUTTING JOKE.

÷ Divided by. The sign of division. Example
[8]
1. The Whigs.       2. The Church. A house
divided against itself. Division of property; the
lion's share,      c.

SIGNS OF PROPORTION.

Is to: so is:: As Lord B               is to Bishop
P              , so is a blue musquito to a planter's nose.

As Sir R               I               is to J               H              , so is
a pair of donkey's-ears to a barber's-block.

As Tommy Duncombe is to Lord Stanley, so
is shrimp-sauce to a boiled turbot.

THE POOR CURATE.        THE BISHOP.

RULE I.
NUMERATION.

Numeration teaches the different value of
figures by their different places (see Walkinghame,
Court Guide, Law List,      c.); also the value of
ciphers, or noughts, according to their relative
situations (see Intellectual Calculator, or Martin's
Arithmetical Frames). As regards the value of
figures in places, we have illustrations in sinecures
[10]
of all grades, from the Lords of the Treasury to
the meanest underling of the Stamp-Office.

Place and pension make the unit a multitude,
according to the position of the noughts,       that is,
that large portion of the public called the nobodies.
The more a man is surrounded by his inferiors,
the greater he becomes. Hence the necessity of
restrictive tariffs to prevent wealth in a community,       and
of impediments to education. It is not,
therefore, naughty for our betters to keep us down
by any kind of mystification; as the sun always
looks larger through a fog.

The value of figures and of ciphers will be well
understood in the following table, which ought to
be committed faithfully to memory. It will be
seen that when the noughts, the nobodies, that is,
the people, go before the legislative units, their
value is consequently decreased; but when they
follow as good backers in good measures, the value
of the characters is increased ad infinitum.

[12]
RULE II.

ADDITION.

Our life is an addition sum; sometimes long,
sometimes short; and Death, with "jaws capacious,"
sums up the whole of our humanity by
making the "tottle" of the whole.

Man is an adding animal; his instinct is, to get.
He is an illustration of the verb, to get, in all its
inflexions and conjugations; and thus we get and
beget, till we ourselves are added to our fathers.

There are many ways of performing addition,
as in the following: a young grab-all comes upon
the fumblers at long-taw, as Columbus did upon
the Indians; or, as every thrifty nation does upon
the weak or unsuspicious, and cries "Smuggins!"

[13]
Addition is also performed in a less daring
manner by the save-all process, till Death, with his
extinguisher, shuts the miser up in his own smoke.



A SAVE-ALL.

Addition may also be performed by subtraction
by other methods. It is one to make "Jim along
Josey!" the watchword, as Joey does in the pantomime.



If you would be merry,
And never would fret,
Then, get all you can,
And keep all you get.



[14]

MIHI CURA FUTURI.

Addition teaches, also, to add units together, and
to find their sum total, as A + B = 2. A bachelor
is a unit; a Benedict, unitee.



Matrimonial Addition.       By common ciphering
1 and 1 make 2. But, by the mathematics of
matrimony, 1 and 1 will produce from 1 to 20,
arranged in row, one above another, like a flight of
[15]
stairs. They make a pretty addition to a man's
effects, as well as to his income; and, if not themselves
capital, are a capital stimulus to exertion.
Surrounded by these special pleaders, a man
becomes as sharp-set as a Lancashire ferret, and
looks as fierce as a rat-catcher's dog at a sink-hole.
Such men ought to be labelled, "Beware of this
unfortunate dog!" for he would bite at a file!



A MAN OF MANY WOES.



Adding to your name.       This is another mode
of performing addition. It is not necessary to go
[16]
to an university for this, any more than it is necessary
to go to a church to get married. The thing
can now be done without it. Schoolmasters, and
pettifoggers of all kinds, will find this an excellent
piece of practical wisdom.

"ADDITION FOR COMMON NAMES."

[17]
ADDING TO A STORY.



"Oh! Mrs. Wiggins, I declare
I never heard the like!
The wretch knows how to curse and swear,
To bite, and scratch, and strike!


"All day he's tossicated, and
All night he roams about;
But that is lucky, sure, for he
Is worse when in than out."


"If this is what you get when wed,
I'm glad I yet have tarried:       
Better to keep one's single bed,
Than venture to get married.


"But such a monster! By and by
That idle minx, his wife,
With all her mawkish tenderness,
Must 'gainst him swear her life.


[18]
"The fine piano long ago,
Just after my last rout,
With candlesticks and cruets too,
Are all gone up the spout.


"And bills return'd, as I have heard,
Last week, one, two, or three;
And summonses for grocery       
'Tis nothing, though, to me.


"They live like cat and dog. I own
She always was a scold.
She broke the table on his crown;
So I was lately told.


"'Tis nothing, though, my dear, to me,
As I before have said.
If married people don't agree,
They ought not to get wed."


To go back a little to first principles, which
should never be lost sight of in the teaching of
any art or science, we must set forth the grand
leading rule before our pupils. Addition teaches,
therefore,[19]


1. To get all we can.
2. To keep all we get.


SONG.

"Argent comptant."

PARENTAL ADVICE.       RULE I.



Get money, my son, get money,
Honestly if you can;
It makes life sweet as honey       
My son, get money, get money!


Don't stand upon ceremony,
Or you may look mighty funny;
But make it your constant song,
Get money, get money, get money!


Money makes the mare to go, boy,
Where every path looks sunny.
Go it! my lad, through thick and thin;
Get money, get money, get money!


[20]
RULE II.       TAKE CARE OF NO. I.



No. I.       O! since the world was made from 0,
And since old Time began,
The maxim was, and still must be,
Take care of No. I.


Look at the "Times," our oracle,
As sure as any gun,
With hand upon the dial-plate,
It points to No. I.[2]


All men are fond of him, and for
His sake round earth will run,
And bustle, turmoil, rub, and scrape
For goodly No. I.


The soldier, who so gallantly
Hath battles nobly won,
Though bravely fighting, ever still
Takes care of No. I.


[21]
The mouthing prigs of Parliament,
With long yarns nightly spun,
Watch well for place and patronage,
And all for No. I.


And those who preach of charity,
Enough your ears to stun,
In making up their long accounts,
Take care of No. I.


One follows law, one physic serves,
As shadows serve the sun;
But briefs, and draughts, and boluses
All make for No. I.


And those that oft make love more sweet
Than cakes of Sally Lunn,
In all their ardour ever have
An eye to No. I.


In short, mankind, both young and old,
When serious or in fun,
From hour to hour, from day to day,
Take care of No. I.


[22]
The rich, the poor, both high and low,
Ay, every mother's son,
From Court to Poor-law Union,
Take care of No. I.


Too bad it is to be a bore,
And so my strain is done,
Except it is to say once more,
Take care of No. I.




The man who takes care of No. 1.



[23]
RULE III.
SUBTRACTION.



"I'll example you with thievery.
The sun's a thief, and with his great subtraction
Robs the vast sea. The moon's an arrant thief,
And her pale fire she snatches from the sun.
The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves
The moon into salt tears. The earth's a thief,
That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen
From general excrement: each thing's a thief.
The laws you curb and whip in their rough power
Have uncheck'd theft. All that you meet are THIEVES."


Shakspere.


Subtraction teaches to "take from" or to find
the difference of two numbers; having taken too
much in, and slept out; to find the difference in
sovereigns and shillings between that and sleeping
at home according to the "conventional laws of
virtuous propriety." (Vide Miss Martineau.)

The figures are to be arranged in subtraction
one under the other; that line expressing the
[24]
highest number, being placed above the line
expressing the smaller number. In this arrangement,
the upper line is called the subtrahend, and
the lower the subtractor; the difference is called
the remainder. Our readers, the million, are the
subtrahend. The following are subtractors:       


Corn and sugar monopolists.
Tax-collector.
Easter dues, beadle and clerk.
Poor-rate.
Christmas-box and Christmas-piece.
Subscriptions for Chiggered Niggers.
Parson Smith and his orphans.
Poor relations.


The Rule of Subtraction is perhaps the most
useful in either national, political, or commercial
Arithmetic; "Take from" being the universal
maxim of mankind from the day that Adam and
Eve stole the forbidden fruit. In sacred history
we find various exemplifications of the principle:
Jacob made use of it when he obtained his
brother's birthright and his blessing; David, when
he took the wife of Uriah. Profane or classical
history abounds with examples. It was the royal
and sacerdotal rule, in all climes, countries, and
[25]
times. Kings have grown thrifty by it, and
conquerors invincible. "Take from" is, in short,
the motto of the legislators; and rhetoric the
soldier's watchword, the prince's condescension, the
courtezan's smile, the lawyer's brief, the priest's
prayer, and the tradesman's craft. The use of this
rule, is to enable us to "do one another," not "as
we would be done," without the contravention of
the majesty of the law.







[26]
"For why       because the good old rule
Suffices us       the simple plan,
That they should take who have the power,
And they should keep       who can."


We have had some amusing ways of performing
this rule in "by-gone ages." Among the most
celebrated, were Indulgences and Benevolences.
They worked well for those who worked ill, and
led to a multiplication of heresies.

Subtraction is perhaps one of the most fashionable
of all the rules; and any one who sets himself
down for a gentleman must expect to be beset by
a swarm of hungry locusts, who make a rule to
bleed him at every pore till he becomes poor.
When Edward the First took the wealth of the
Jews and their teeth at the same time, he showed a
fatherly consideration for those who having nothing
to eat wanted neither incisores, cuspidati, bicuspidæ,
or molarii. But we are to be nipped, and
squeezed, and tapped, and leeched, and drained to
all eternity, and are still expected to       give.

To take in.       This rule not only teaches us to
take from, but also to take in, which is to take
from, with true tact and skill. England is the
[27]
Land of Goshen in this particular, and Smithfield
the focus of the art, whence the first rule for
selling a horse is       



1. Take in your own father,
Or, if you would rather,
You may take in your mother,
Or humbug your brother;
And though you just kissed her,
Bamboozle your sister;
Or you may send
For your friend;
Or, still fond of pelf,
If you can't find an elf,
You may take in yourself.




TAKEN IN AND DONE FOR.


[28]

"who steals MY purse steals trash."


SUBTRACTION OF CHARACTER, OR DE-TRACTION.

The rules already given for performing this
branch of arithmetic apply to money matters;
but the perfection of the art consists, not in simply
taking from another what you want yourself, but
that which does not enrich you, but makes him
poor indeed. This has been styled, by way of
eminence, the devil's subtraction, being the general
essence of the black art. It is called Detraction.

[29]
Detraction may be performed in a variety of
ways, as for example:       "Oh, I know him       his
great grandfather was       but no matter, and his
mother       no better than she should be, but I hate
to speak evil of the dead. I have enough to do to
mind my own business       and yet one cannot help
knowing       but yet nobody knows what he is or
how he gets his money. He makes a show certainly,
but I like things to be paid for before they
are sported. His wife, too       what was she, do
you suppose? As I have heard, a cook in a
tradesman's family.       Well, a cook is not so bad
after all       I am sure it is better than a doctor.
But I believe he was forced to marry her.       Poor
woman, she suffered, I dare say       Well, it is well it
is no worse       It was the only amends he could
make her       It would have been a cruel thing for
the poor innocent children to be born illegitimate.       But
he is still very gay       These sort of men will
be       but there will be an exposé some day.
Things can't go on for ever       Well, I wish them
no harm, poor creatures       But do you go to
their party to-night?       I go only for the sake
of seeing how madam cook conducts the entertainment."



[30]
Rule for Ladies With Regard To Their
Rivals.       Should any lady be so unfortunate as
to fear a rival in the affections of some simple-hearted
swain in the personal attractions of some
youthful beauty whom he has never seen, it must be
her method not to vilify her character or underrate
her accomplishments,       no, this is but sorry skill.
The more delicate and refined way of subtracting
from her merits will be to employ unbounded
panegyric, so as to raise the expectations of the
feared admirer, that the real shall fall infinitely
short of the ideal. This is another mode of performing
subtraction by addition.



Literary Subtraction.       This is of essential
service to editors, reviewers, and others, who,
having nothing good of their own with which to
amuse the public, steal the brains of others.

Rule.       Take from a work published at a
guinea all its cream and quintessence, under
pretence of praising it into immortality through
the pages of your fourpenny review. "Castrant
alios, ut libros suos per se graciles alieno adipe
suffarciant."



[31]
Mercantile Subtraction.       It is well understood
in this country, that no honest man can get
a living, in consequence of the extraordinary competition
among us. It is therefore considered legal
and justifiable for the baker to "take toll" and make
"dead men;" for the licensed victualler to make
"two butts out of one;" for the wine-merchant
to "doctor" his port; for the butcher to "hang on
Jemmy;" for the printer to make "corrections;"
for the tailor to "cabbage;" for the grocer to
"sand his sugar and birch-broom his tea." The
milkman "waters his milk" by act of parliament;
and to show that all this is in the order of Providence,
the rains of heaven wet the coals.



National or Political Subtraction.       There
is one part of the New Testament which all
Christian rulers have religiously observed, namely,
"Now, Cæsar issued a decree that all the world
should be taxed." The art of taxation is, therefore,
not only a religious obligation, but is the science
of sciences and the most important part of National
Arithmetic.

Taxation is necessary just as blood-letting is
necessary in plethora. Over-feeding produces a
[32]
determination of the blood to the head, and then
radical rabidity breaks out into rebellion. Over-feeding
requires bleeding. There is a tendency
in every industrious nation to get on too fast.
Taxation is the fly-wheel which softens and
regulates the motion of the national machinery,
the safety valve which prevents explosion, while
that accumulation of taxation called the dead
weight is a "clogger" to keep things down.

Whenever there is a "rising," it is a sure sign
that taxation is too light; consequently taxation
should be so accommodated to the habits, tastes,
and feelings of the people, as to fit them at all
points, like well-made harness. If they grow too
enlightened we can double the window-tax; if
they be disposed to kick, put on the breeching in
the shape of an income-tax; if they go too much
by the head, we can raise the price of malt, and,
by way of a martingale, put a duty on spirits;
if they jib, we can touch them on the raw with
"the house duty;" if they step out too fast,
tighten the "bearing rein" by 10 per cent. on the
assessment; and should any attempt be made to
bolt, we can secure them with a curb, by a tax
on absentees.

[33]
The perfection of taxation is to make it as much
as possible like an insensible perspiration; or to
cause it to subtract, like the vampire when lulling
the victim to sleep, by fanning him with the
wings of patriotism and the hum-hum of a liberal
oration, on the principle of



"Bleeding made easy."




"FORKING UP."



[34]
RULE IV.
MULTIPLICATION.



9 × 1 = 9.


Multiplication teaches a short way of adding
one number together any number of times. Its
sign is a cat o'-nine-tails; its symbol a whipping-post.
Since the wonderful powers of the number
nine have been publicly discussed, we have had no
more shooting at her Majesty, (Heaven preserve
her!) which shows the transcendant powers of
arithmetical argument. The Egyptian plague of
frogs and flies exemplifies this rule. In Modern
Rome we have multiplication of fleas. In Modern
Babylon we have multiplication of bugs, particularly
humbugs. In the West Indies we have
[35]
multiplication of musquitoes and piccaninies, and
in the East, multiplication of oneself, as in the
case of Abbas Mirza and his 1000 sons for a body
guard.



Multiplication of Laws.       This is a favourite
amusement with our modern legislators. It
naturally leads to the multiplication of lawyers,
whose proper calling is to set people together by
the ears, for the multiplication of dissensions.
The original type of this order was the plague of
locusts.



Domestic Multiplication, or Multiplication
of miseries. This rule is performed by taking
unto oneself a wife for better or worse; then,
multiplying as usual, and, at the end of fifteen or
twenty years, having the young "olive branches"
round about our tables.



Multiplication of Money.       This is the most
universal case in the whole rule. The multipliers
are the operatives, who are placed at the bottom,
instead of the top of the arithmetical scale. They
may be ranged, in general, as in the following:       [36]


A cotton spinner, 3½d. a-day.
Spitalfields weaver, 4½d.
Brummagem, 5½d.


These digits are to be worked from fourteen to
sixteen hours a-day at the lowest possible fraction
of pay. The product is to be set down in the 3½
per cents. or invested in the first unjust war in
which this nation may be engaged; or the whole
aggregate of sums may be multiplied by monopoly.[37]





LAWYER DIVIDING THE OYSTER.

RULE V.
DIVISION.



Do not think I write in jest,
Though something in derision,
Look east and west, and north and south,
There's nothing but Division.


[38]
The State, with Whigs and Radicals,
Is split up and divided,
The Church, with hungry pluralists,
Is getting quite lop-sided.


A split is in the methodists,
The jumpers and the shakers,
A split is with the baptists too,
A split is in the quakers.


The Jews have split like gentile dogs,
And some are trying daily
To send Mahomet to the hogs,
In spite of Mahommed Ali.


The law is split, and fees are down
To stop the rise of lawyers,
And costs are cut, oh! quite in half,
Just like a log by sawyers.


Divide, divide, the Speaker cries,
Each night with voice of thunder,
But yet the law thus made "so wise,"
Most likely is a blunder.


Division teaches how to divide a number into
two or more equal parts, as in the division of
prize-money.

[39]
Division is of great importance, whether political,
ecclesiastical, commercial, civil, or social. Nothing
is more likely to destroy your opponents than a
split. Divide et impera is the true Machiavelian
policy of all governments.

Numbers, that is the multitude, are to be
divided, in a variety of ways,       by mob orators, or
by mob-sneaks, or by parliamentary flounderers,
or by mystifying pulpit demagogues.

The divisors should generally endeavour to
work into their own hands, and the dividends
may be compared to fleeced-sheep, plucked-geese,
scraped sugar-casks, drained wine-bottles, and
squeezed lemons.



Social Division.       The divisions here may be a
tale-bearer, a gossip, or a go-between, and the
divisors will "separate" to fight like Kilkenny
cats, leaving nothing behind but two tails and a
bit of flue. In a township, a volunteer corps is an
excellent divisor: you may kill the adjutant by
way of a quotient, on the surgical principle of
"Mangling done here."

In the division of property by will, be your
own lawyer, and your property will be divided to
[40]
your heart's content; for, as your heirs will most
assuredly be divided amongst themselves, when
they have done fighting over your coffin for what
does not belong to them, they will call upon the
Court of Chancery to divide it       principally among
the lawyers, according to the lex non scripta.

In the division of profits, first take off the cream
three times, and then divide the milk.



THE LION'S SHARE.

In all kinds of "Division of Money" endeavour
to carry out the principle of the fable. Like the
[41]
lion when dividing the spoil, consider that you
have a right to the first part, because you are a
lion; to the second, because you are strong; to
the third, because no one dares dispute your right;
and to the fourth, because no one is so able as
yourself to defend it. This is the lion's share.



Division of Time.       "Tempus fugit," and therefore
the due systematic and proper division of
time, in a rational manner, is the bounden duty of
every "beardling." All philosophers and some
kings, whether from Democritus to Tim Bobbin,
or from Alfred the Great to that merry old soul,
"Old King Cole," have divided their time
equitably, according to the maxim of Horace,
"Carpe diem, quam minimum credula postero."
Modern life teaches and exhibits the same necessity
for the rigid division of the "stuff life is made of,"
and the twenty-four hours may be systematically
divided, with great advantage, by young men, as
follows:       


HOURS.
1.To yawning, vertigo, head-ache and soda-water, say from one to three, A.M.2
2.From pulling off the night-cap to putting the first leg out of bed1
[42]
3.To "cat-lap," "broiled chickens," Lackadaisical Magazine, "Dry Punch," and Gazette of Fashion2½
4.To the study of "cash stalking," the art of post-obits, with lessons from Professor Mœshes on the science of "Bondology." (Nocturnâ versate manu, versate diurnâ)1
5.To lounging, "dawdling," "muddling," sauntering, losing oneself in "ins and outs," "nowheres,"      c.1½
6.To dressing for dinner, to getting on a pair of boots, half an hour, swearing at coat quarter of an hour, selecting vests half an hour, cursing pantaloons quarter of an hour, shaving, and other unnecessaries2½
7.To dining, wineing, brighting the eye, doubling the cape, getting half seas over, going into port instead of finding a champaign country2
8.To dressing for opera, "titivating," "bear's greasing," curling, barbarizing, scenting, putting on opera countenance, and ogling1½
9.To tying on stock half an hour, to putting on gloves quarter of an hour, to curling whiskers half an hour, to laying on the rouge,      c.1½
10.To bowing, scraping, hemming, hawing, yawning, toying, soft-sawdering, salooning, staggering, cigaring, coaching, and finishing3½
11.To no one knows what       Nisi castè saltem cautè5
            24


LONG DIVISION.

Long Division is so called when a long time is
taken for the division of various sums, as in the
case of the Deccan prize-money, or the Duke of
York's debts. In these cases, various persons are
[43]
placed in the state of longing       hence the name of
the rule, which is a figurative exemplification of
"hope deferred."



Rule I       Teaches to work an expected legacy or
an estate in reversion, or a right of entail, with a
"post-obit bond," cent. per cent. on a stiff stamen.



Rule II       Teaches how to wait for a living
instead of working for one. This is a hungry
expectancy: yourself, in a consumption, with an
interesting cough, preaching as curate to an admiring
congregation principally composed of females,
who bring jellies and jams, pitch-plasters, electuaries,
and pills, "bosom friends," and other comforters,
while the jolly incumbent, with his rosy
gills and round paunch, writes you once a quarter
to dine with him, to see how well he holds it.



Rule III. Chancery Long Division.       This is an
exemplification of the "law's delay," and the rule
is to be worked by giving the expectants the
"benefit of a doubt," which is not quite so pleasant
in Chancery as in criminal practice. The "Bidder"
of this rule was John Lord Eldon.



[44]
Rule IV.       Beside long annuities, there are also
long dividends. For instance, in the case of Bamboozle,
Humbug and Co. who lately declared the
third and last dividend of three-fourths of a farthing
in a pound, for the benefit of their creditors.


THE INSOLVENT TRAP.

"THE LAW BINDS, BUT THE LAW LOOSES."



[45]
RULE VI.
REDUCTION.

Reduction is properly the "art of sinking." It
teaches us, according to Martin, to bring numbers
to a lower name without altering their value.
When numbers are brought to a higher name, it
is called Reduction ascending, when to a lower,
Reduction descending.



Reduction ascending is to stand high in your
own estimation, from the convincing reason, that,
as no one thinks anything of you, you ought to
think something of yourself. The visit of the
Queen to Edinburgh raised the baillies so high in
their own estimation, that it took them three hours
to get up in a morning.

[46]
Examples of Reduction ascending are to be found
in the following cases:       When a noodle is made
a lord; 2. When Timothy Fig obtains a baronetcy;
3. When Muggins keeps his "willa;" and
when a beggar gets on horseback.



Reduction ascending for Females.       Mrs.
General Swipes, Mrs. Colonel Trashee, Mrs. Major
Minus, Mrs. Alderman Bumble, Mrs. Common-sergeant
Sprigings, Mrs. Common-councilman Snigings,
Mrs. Executioner Ketch, Mrs. Beadle Blow-em-up,
Mrs. Corporal Casey.

Reduction ascending is to be seen in the manufacturing
districts; when the body politic gets inflated,
a "rising of the lights," that is, of the
illuminati, may be expected. In these risings
the scum always gets uppermost, and some political
demagogue is ejected to parliament by a
revolutionary eruction       to be reduced to his own
level as a leveller.



Reduction descending.       



"Facilis descensus averni,
Sed revocare gradum, superasque evadere ad auras
Hic labor, hoc opus est."


[47]
This is the "old saw" Alderman Harmer used
when he cut the city       or Lord John in his
"finality" speech       cut his own fingers.

POLITICAL REDUCTION.

There have been many examples of Political
Reduction both in our last and present ministry.
The reduction of postage, so that it paid less than
the cost, was an exceedingly business-like act.
The reduction of cats'-meat in the storehouses at
Plymouth, Woolwich, Portsmouth, and Chatham,
from a penny to three farthings a-day, was also
an example of legislative wisdom, and proved the
maxim, "Sparus at the speketas letouat the
bungholeas."

The reduction of paupers' food to "doubly
diminutive and beautifully less" than that of the
felon, is also "wisdom wonderful;" being a new
way of offering a premium upon crime, at about
thirty and a third per cent. It is presumed to
have occurred with a view to the assistance of
Old Bailey practice, and of the Poor Law
[48]
Commissioners, as it promotes Coroners' inquests
and saves coffins.



Rule for the Reduction of Paupers.       Take "an
operative," starve him in the streets till he becomes
light enough to make a shuttlecock of, then place
in his hands an order from an Edmonton magistrate,
by way of a feather; bandy him about
from parish to parish till you are tired of the
game. Let him then fall into the lock-up of the
station-house. Keep him sixteen hours in a
cold cell without food. Bring him before the
Board, put him on the refractory diet, water-gruel,
poultice dumplings, and rat roastings. Keep
him till he becomes so thin as to lose his shadow,
then turn him into the streets to look for a job,
with three yards of cord in his pocket, and a
direction to the nearest lamp-post, as an intimation
of what that job is to be.

A state may be reduced in the same way by
nip-cheese patriots. Such "save-alls," when they
lop off excrescences, bark the trunk       when they
prune redundances, let loose the sap. These
"flint-skinners" grind down professions, pare
down dignities, sweat sovereigns, purge the
[49]
commonwealth, scour landlords, skin the army,
starve the navy, scrape religion to the backbone, sell
the honour of their country for a mess of porridge
and its glory for a bag of moonshine; till at last
John Bull becomes as lean as a country whipping-post,
and would hang himself, only he has not
weight enough on him to produce strangulation.





"BLOWED PUFFERY."

[50]
RULE VII.
PROPORTION.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE.

Proportion is sometimes called the "Rule of
Three," because a certain system of conventionalisms
has its origin in that, which is called, by way
[51]
of joke, the "Three Estates" of the realm       King,
Lords, and Commons; in other words, a parliament,
so called from its being the focus of palaver, in
which originate those splendid specimens of collective
wisdom, known by the name of Acts of
Parliament       because they "won't act."

The theoretic proportion is, that numbers should
be exactly balanced,       that one sovereign should
equal six hundred lords, that six hundred lords
should equal six hundred and fifty-eight commoners,
and that these should represent twenty-nine millions
of people. Now, as the interests of each of these
estates are said in theory to be opposed to each
other, and as they are all theoretically supposed to
pull three opposite ways with equal force, it must
follow that legislation would be at a stand still, by
the first law of mechanics, viz. that action and
reaction are always equal: but to prevent such
a catastrophe of stagnation, and to set in motion
this beautiful machine, a pivot-spring, in the
shape of a prime minister, or prime mover, is
superadded, and a golden supply, fly, or budget
wheel, is introduced, by which the following
subordinate, yet ruling principles are developed;
[52]
and thus we go on from age to age, making laws
one day, and unmaking them the next, for the sake
of variety.



"OUT OF PROPORTION."

[53]
THE WORKING OF THE RULE.

It must not be forgotten that this rule is one of
proportionals, as its name imports. It therefore
teaches proportion in all its relations, social and
political; it is the rule of our country, and seeks
to develop that beautiful equality and justice, so
conspicuous in all our institutions, exemplified in
the following well-known legal and constitutional
maxim, viz. "One man may steal a horse, but
another must not look over the hedge."

It is a maxim of English law, that punishment
should be proportionate to the offence, and have a
relation to the moral turpitude of the offender.
Hence the seducer and adulterer only inquire,
"What's the damage?" By the same rule, it is
held highly penal to sell the only ripe fruit in
England, roasted apples; and the stock in trade
of the basket woman is confiscated. She, too, is
[54]
sent to the Counter       because she is not rich enough
to keep one with a shop attached.



CALLED TO ACCOUNT.

This brings us to the rationale of reward, and
shows us the policy of making a prison superior to
a poor-house. This wise arrangement of the
collective wisdom of the Rule of Three (the three
estates) is upon the principle of counter-irritation,
that is, the best way to administer to the miserable
is to inflict more misery, just as we put
[55]
a blister on one part to subdue inflammation on
another, or set up a mercurial disease to cure a
liver complaint. On the other hand, we cure
villany by increased rations of beef, bread, beer,
and potatoes, in accordance with the maxim, that
"the nearest way to a man's heart is through his
stomach."





On the same principle of "Proportion," the
operative is to have for his share the pleasure of
[56]
doing the labour; for if one man had the labour
and the gains too, it would be abominable, and
destructive to all the usages of society.

It is also strictly proportional, that we should
pay not only for what we have, but for that which
we have not. Thus church-rates ought to be
inflicted, not so much for the benefit of the church,
but as the substitute for that wholesome discipline
of flagellation, unhappily discontinued, and for the
"good of the soul;" for if the spiritual benefit
be great to those who pay for what they receive
only, how great must be the reward of those who
are content to pay for that which, they not only do
not receive, but which they will not have at any
price! Hence, it is possible that even dissenters
may be saved       the trouble of spending their money
in other ways.

The "Tax upon Incomes" affords also a striking
example of the doctrine of Proportionals. It is so
beautifully equalized, that the loss upon one branch
of trade is not to be set off against the gain of
another, the object of the act being, no doubt, to
put a stop to trade altogether, as the best means of
placing things statu quo, the grand desideratum
of modern legislation.

[57]
"Bear ye each other's burdens" is a sublime
maxim. The principle of the lever is well
brought to bear in the doctrine of proportionals       and
shows how to shift the weight of taxation
from the shoulders of the rich upon those of the
poor       



A SLIDING SCALE.

The laws and regulations for the conduct of our
civil polity and social condition being founded on
these divine principles, it is assumed as a fundamental
maxim, that "great folks will be biggest,"
and he who has not learned that this is the ideal of
[58]
true proportion, and who does not recognise it in
his practical philosophy, will be compelled to
knock his head against a wall to the day of his
dissolution.




[59]

"BROKEN DOWN."

RULE VIII.
FRACTIONS.

The word Fractions is from the Latin "Fractus,"
broken. A Fraction is therefore a part or broken
piece. A broken head is a fraction; a broken
heart is a fraction; a bankrupt is a fraction       he is
[60]
broken up; yet a horse is not a fraction, although
he may be broken in       but his rider may have a
broken neck, which is called an irreducible fraction.
Speaking generally, therefore, a fraction may be
considered as a "Tarnation Smashification."



FRACTIONAL SIGNS.

Fractions are of two kinds, Vulgar and Decimal.
Vulgar fractions are used for common purposes,
and examples may be seen in the plebeian part of
our commonalty, such as coal-heavers, costermongers,
sheriff's-officers, bailiffs, bagmen, cabmen,
excisemen, lord-mayors, lady-mayoresses,
carpet-knights and auctioneers.[61]

Vulgar fractions may be known by the way in
which they express themselves. They are more
expressive than decimals; and the words, Go it,
Jerry       Jim along Josey       What are you at?       What
are you arter?       Variety       Don't you wish
you may get it?       All round my hat       Over the
left       All right, and no mistake       Flare up, my
covies       I should think so       with those inexpressible
expletives which add so much to the force and
elegance of our language, may be taken as specimens
of Fractions.

Here, Ladies, and Gentlemen, is a lot,
Being the earliest that must "go to pot."
I do declare,
'Tis very rare,
And mighty curious,
And nothing spurious,
Preserved from bye-gone ages,
Embalmed in sacred pages,
Of ancient poetry.
Who'll bid, who'll buy?
Be not shy,
Bid high.


Behold       the identical cupboard,

The identical hat
The little dog wore
When nursing the cat;
The identical pipe
The little dog smoked
When she brought him the tripe;
[66]
The identical coffin
That set the dog laughing,
With these two are sorted,
As "neat as imported."

Who eat of a Christmas pie;
He put in his thumb
And he pulled out "a plum,"
As you must do if you buy.

[68]
LOT III.



Now come the gems divine,
Each gem a shrine,
Whence men may fish up,
And after dish up,
Without a Bishop,
A heavenly worship;
And adore
These relics before.
First, is the vase de Barberino,
The Helmet of Mambrino
So renowned
In all climes
In which the cat was drowned;
Don Quixote's spear, and shield, and armour,
Lately worn by Alderman Harmer
Against the "Times."
Second, the sword of Jack the Giant Killer,
Made o' th' siller
Spent at the Ipswich election,
Braving detection.
[69]
Third, is the wishing cap of Fortunatus,
Worn by all young ladies in their teens,
That when they're married they may have the reins.
Fourth, is the night cap of the Cock-lane ghost,
When he fright'ned
The enlight'ned
Chartist host.
Fifth, is a stone out of the wall,
Of Pyramus and Thisbe,
And a charmed echo of Nick Bottom's roar,
Or louder snore
Of Mr. Muntz, when he thinks Lord John a bore.
Sixth, one of the seven-leagued boots, in which is
Made the interminable of Cobden's speeches,
Loose as the old coal-heaver Huntington's
Heaven-born breeches.
Seventh, the bottle of the bottle-conjurer,
Into which Lord Mounteagle, to please himself,
Can squeeze himself,
When in some plan of plunder or of pelf
He wants to ease himself.
Eighth, is the toe nail of the Dragon of Wantley,
Which Berkeley Grantley
Used as a sort of scarifying razor
Upon a Fraser.
[70]
Ninth, is the dish of Corn Law furmitory,
Into which Tom Thumb (Lord John) did jump when he
Let in another Ministry.
Tenth, a child's caul, a certain preservation
From drowning, useful to the nation,
In this great age of tea-to-tality,
And used by Mr. Buckingham
As an hydraulic ram,
To keep him dry,
When round the world to go he late did try.
Eleventh, is a bottle of pigeon's milk,
Soft as silk,
Which Boreing to the "Factory" deputation sent,
By way of reparation
For the depredation
Of sessions of misgovernment.
Twelfth, is the story of a cock and bull,
Edited by queer Joseph, and oft related to the house
When full.
Thirteenth, the eyelid of Homer, and the eye
Identical and very certain,
Of Betty Martin.
[71]
And, lastly, now to end this, Billy Martin, Peter
Parley, Prattle,
Are three blue beans in a blown bladder.
Rattle, bladder, rattle.




KNOCKING DOWN THE LOT.




[72]

DONE BY INTEREST.


RULE IX.
INTEREST,      c.

To think of getting on in this world without
Interest, is ridiculous. Place and Promotion are
not for Fitness or Worthiness, but to serve particular
Interests, private or public; and yet a
[73]
number of very simple persons, who have as large
a green streak in them as a sage cheese, without
its sageness, are continually wondering that virtue
and talent do not get all the "good things" of a
vicious community. Punch forbid! Is not virtue
declared to be its own reward? and as to talent,       let
a man be content with that. It is a positive
monopoly to covet wit and money too.



AT A PREMIUM AND DISCOUNT.

To take care of our Interest is the great law of
Nature, and is universally followed. Every one
for himself, and Fate for us all, as the donkey said
when he danced among the chickens, is as profound
a maxim as the gnothi seauton of Plato.
[74]
"Take care of yourself" is of more importance
than "Know thyself." To take care of oneself is
a science which comes home to every man's business
and bosom. It is "wisdom" identified with
our personal character. It is philosophy turned
to account. It is morality above par. It is a
religion in which "every man may be his own
parson," find his Bible in his ledger, his Creed in
the "stock-list," his Psalter in the tariff, his Book
of Common Prayer in the railway and canal
shares, his Temple in the Royal Exchange, his
Altar in his counter, and his God in his money.



THE OLD AND NEW PRINCIPLE       BOTH WITH CREDIT.




[75]
Principle, or Principal, is an old term used by
our forefathers in "money matters" and commercial
transactions, but is now obsolete. It formerly
represented capital, and raised the British merchant
in the scale of nations; but it is now a
maxim of trade to discard Principle as not being
consistent with Interest. It is paradoxically
Capital to take care of our Interest, but it seldom
requires any Principle to do so.

"The want of money is the root of all evil."
Such is the new reading, according to the translation
of a new sect called the Tinites. In the orthodox
translation, the love of money was unfortunately
rendered. To be without money is worse than being
without brains       for this reason we should oppose
all dangerous innovations, which in any way have
a tendency to disturb the "balance of Capital."
Right is not to usurp might. We are not, for the
sake of Quixotic experiment, to invade the interests
of the landed proprietor by an Anti-Corn Law
movement, nor the vested right of doing wrong,
which the various close corporations of law, physic,
and trade,      c. have so long maintained, making
England the envy of the world and the glory of
surrounding nations.


[76]

THE TIN-DER PASSION.


Interest, therefore, teaches us to interest ourselves
for our own interests, and to keep them continually
in view in all our transactions. When a man
loses sight of his own interests he is morally
blind; he must, therefore, according to this rule,
walk with his eyes open, and be wide awake to
every move       keep the weather-eye open, and not
have one eye up the chimney and the other in
[77]
the pot, but both stedfastly fixed on the main
chance.

Interest teaches us also to swear to anything and
admit nothing; to prove, by the devil's rhetoric,
that black is white and white black; to tamper,
to shuffle, to misrepresent, to falsify, to scheme,
to undervalue, to entangle, to evade, to delay,
to humbug, and to cheat in virtue of the monied
interest.



FAITH AND DUTY.

In the days of our forefathers, we had a most
excellent compendium of Faith and Duty, called
[78]
the "Church Catechism," which taught us not only
to "fear God and honour the King," but to be "true
and just in all our dealings." The "fast and loose,"
"free and easy" system of "liberality," shuts the
Creed and the Catechism out of half our schools;
and worldliness teaches in its place the creed of
Mammon. Instead of being taught to worship
God, we are taught to worship money. Instead of
honouring the Queen, we are told to bow down to
the "golden image" which trade has set up; we no
longer consult our conscience, but our pocket; for
principle we read interest       for piety, pelf.

In illustration of this, the following "cut and
dry" "'Change Catechism," which fell from the
pocket of a Latitudinarian bill-broker, is subjoined,
as affording the best examples of the Rule
of Interest.

[83]



RULE X.
BILLS.





When goods are bought or work is done, a bill
is to be made out and delivered. In some cases
the bill may be made out before the work is done,
[84]
and work charged in prospective; and therefore the
making out of bills is an art and mystery known
only to the professional man or the tradesman.
It comprehends the mystery of mystification, and
impudence and assurance are its two first rules.
The milkman is not only allowed by parliament to
water his milk, but to cut a notch in his chalk and
mark double. The baker thinks it legitimate, and
part of his vested rights, to put in "dead uns;" the
butcher to "hang on Jemmy;" but the birds noted
for the longest bills are the carpenter woodpecker,
(who undertakes to take you under) the gallipot
[85]
crane, the red-tape snipe, and the heron. The
bills of each of these bipeds are as long as from
this to the paying of the National Debt, and
as unfathomable as the Bay of Biscay       or the
lowest pit of              

L






[86]



I AM INTERESTED.



Dear Sir, my faith in you is great,
Your honour long I've tested;
You are my customer, good Sir,
And I am interested.

[87]

To give you credit is my joy,
A joy sincerely breasted,
For twelve months, ay, for any date;
You see I'm interested.


And may you thrive, and in due time
Retire in comfort nested;
This is my fervent prayer, my friend,
For I am interested.


And may you have a plum or two,
In stock well sunk and vested,
To leave your worthy family       
I speak as interested.


What, "rather queer!" this fellow now
Must quickly be molested;
Write to him, Priggings, for you know
That I am interested.


Well, take his bill. Three months       no two;
Let it be well attested;
Now is the time to turn the screw,
For I am interested.

[88]

What, "no effects!" give him, no time,
But get the bill protested;
Such rascals must be quickly met,
When we are interested.


No cash!       well, write to Sniggs at once,
And let him be arrested;
To Banco Regis let him go,
For I am interested.





[89]

A DECIMAL FIGURE.

RULE XI.
DECIMALS.

Decimal Fractions are so called because the
fractions are always tenths. They differ from
[90]
Vulgar Fractions in this, that the denominator is
not written, but a point before it is used instead.



A STRONG TITHE.

Decimals are best illustrated by tithes, which
are general and universal tenths extracted in every
part of "merry England." They are added, subtracted,
multiplied, and divided like any other
numbers, but to designate their value a point is
prefixed.

In tithes, as in decimals, the denominator does
not appear; that is to say, the incumbent rarely
lives at his incumbency. When tithes are to be
added, taken, or subtracted, the tithodecimo point
[91]
is used as his representative, namely, the POINT OF
THE BAYONET.





To make a point of "doing good by stealth" is
a national virtue; and among all other "points"
in this uncertain world, the "point blank" is the
most certain. This may be made with a rifle,
[92]
when the pockets are to be rifled, either with or
without a bayonet at the end of it. The charge
for spiritual care is best settled by a charge of
dragoons; and a discharge of clerical arrears by a
discharge of fire-arms.[4]

TO REDUCE MONEY WEIGHTS AND MEASURES TO
DECIMALS.

Take a tithe-owner, a collector, a proctor's
warrant, and a constable, and go in a body to the
house of a Quaker, or the mud hovel of an Irish
Catholic. Enter the house by means of a crow-bar.
Take pigs, poultry, pots, pans, sticks, or rattletraps.
Obtain an appraiser, call in a broker, and divide
the spoil by means of any number of vulgar
fractions, called purchasers. Take the dividend,
called plunder, and "pocket."

[93]
TO BRING DECIMALS TO THEIR PROPER VALUE IN WHOLE
NUMBERS.

The proper value of a decimal is only to be ascertained
by his points of character, and they are to
be found of full value in many parts of the kingdom,
in the shape of worthy curates, and honest
rectors and vicars, dividing not their flocks, or
the produce of their flocks, but their own time,
means, and money, in the conscientious discharge of
their clerical duties.



[94]
RULE XII.
PRACTICE.

The Rule of Practice is indispensable in all our
operations. It is in some degree the "ultimatum"
of the preceding rules, for as the proverb says,
"Practice makes perfect."

Nature is said to have begun the creation of
"living infinities" by this rule, for in the words of
the poet,



"She tried her 'prentice hand on man,
And then she made the lasses o."       Burns.


Practice is thus divided into two kinds       the
first called Practice Preliminary; the second is
denominated Practice in General.



[95]
Practice Preliminary is experimental philosophy,
or asking discount for a bill at 18 months;
Practice in General taking in the flats. The one
resolves itself into "trying it on," the other to
"clapping it on."

"Trying it on" is an universal principle, from
the old Jew salesman who asks four pounds for a
thread-bare coat and takes four shillings; or the
old cabbage woman who offers 3lbs. of "taters" for
two pence and sells 7lbs. for three farthings; to
the prime minister who asks three millions of
taxes, and expects five. The converse of this
rule is, "Don't you wish you may get it."

Practice is performed by taking "aliquot parts;"
to be a man of some "parts" is therefore necessary.
The application of our "parts" to the
science of L.S.D. with a view to their development
and perfection, is the aim of the rule, and the
"practice of Practice" is to show,



That the value of a thing
Is just the money it will bring;
For money being the common scale
Of things by measure, weight and rate,
In all affairs of Church and State,
[96]
And both the balance and the weight,
The only force, the only power,
That all mankind fall down before,
Which like the iron sword of kings,
Is the best reason of all things;
The Rule of Practice then would show,
The principles on which men "grow."
What makes all doctrines plain and clear?
A few odd hundreds once a year.
And that which was proved true before,
Prove false again?       Some hundreds more.


Hudibras.



[97]
PRACTISING AT EXETER HALL.

HULLA, BOYS, HULLA.


GRAND CHORUS.



Hulla boys, Hulla boys,
Let the "belles" ring;
Hulla boys, Hulla boys,
So the Whigs sing.


The Council of State
In their heads have a crotchet,
In spite of lawn sleeves,
In spite of the rochet;

[98]

To put for a salvo
The nation in tune,
By keeping them singing
From July till June.


And who can sweet music
A moment despise?
For singing is better,
Far better than sighs.


To reconcile Chartists
To duties on corn,
We'll give them a flourish
Or two on the horn.


To strike all the grumblers
In factories mute,
We'll give them a solo
Each day on the flute.


Should the multitude ask,
By petition, a boon,
We'll grant them reply
Through our "Budget" bassoon.

[99]

And when they shall sicken,
And when they shall fret,
We'll soothe them like lambs,
With our State clarionet.


Should they from their chains
Endeavour to wriggle,[5]
We'll keep them in bonds
By a waltz on the fiddle.


They shall not despair,
Nor hang, drown, or strangle,
We Whigs will strike up
Our tinkling triangle.


And should this not do,
In arms should they come,
We'll frighten them soon
By a roll of the drum!




Practising for the Army.       As shooting and
slaying are the legitimate objects of this profession,
[100]
you cannot begin too early. The first instrument
to be used is a pea-shooter; this is for the age
P.C. previous to corderoys. The second is a pop-gun,
indicating the age of breeches (and breaches).
From this we arise to "sparrow-shooting," after
the ruse de guerre of the salt-box has been tried
without effect. Being now grown bloody-minded,
we go to that sanguiniferous-looking house at
Battersea, called the Red House, (being of a
blood colour, from the enormous slaughter committed
near it,) and here we take lessons in pigeon-shooting.
From hence to the Shooting Gallery,
Pall Mall, we improve rapidly. A lieutenancy in
the Guards is our next step. To this succeeds a
dispute respecting the glottis of Mademoiselle
Catasquallee, and "Chalk-Farm" or "Wimbledon
Common" is the result; and here, unless courage
should ooze out of our fingers' ends, we may
stop; our courage is apparent, and for the future
we may shoot with the "long-bow" to all eternity
without fear of contradiction.



Practising for the Profession.       "Cutting
up" and "Cut and come again," are the maxims of
the surgeon; and as no trade or profession can live
[101]
except by the adoption of the "cutting system," and if
a man cannot cut a figure, he will assuredly be cut
by his acquaintance, surely the art should be thoroughly
studied. As a preliminary step, Burking
and body-snatching must be mastered; and then you
may go snacks in a "subject," and take your "loin
of pauper," "leg of pauper," or "shoulder of
beggar," or "rump of beggar," or "sirloin of
alderman," or "fore-quarter of citizen," or "hand
and spring" of beadle or bellman. Or should
your taste be fastidious, you may take a "fillet of
cherrybum;" or club for a "sucking-kid." On
these practise till you are perfect; and should it
so happen that any of the personages above-named
should turn out to be related by consanguinity,
be as stoical as a reviewer, and make no bones
of cutting-up (if necessary for science) your own
father.



Practising for the Ministry.       The aspirant
for the "tub," "born in a garret, in a kitchen
bred," commences his spiritual career by announcing
to the elect that he is almost sure that he has
had a call (caul), for he has heard his mother
say he was born with one. He may next exhibit
[102]
his buffetings with Satan by showing the marks
of the beast, in the shape of double-dealing, pettifogging,
shuffling, cutting and cheating; he may
next venture on the new birth.





He now attempts open-air preaching on Kennington
Common, and exhibits spiritual rabidity
in good earnest. He foams at the mouth, barks
and bites, and yells in his ravings; calls himself
from a pig to a dog, and from a dog to no gentleman.
What is he? "A bundle of filthy rags,"
"a whited sepulchre," "a cancerous sore," a "sink
[103]
of pollution," "a mass of corruption," "a cesspool,"
"a common sewer," "a worm," "a scorpion,"
"a snake," "a spider," "an adder." He may also
charge himself with murder, abomination, witchcraft,
lying, and every vice denounced in the
Decalogue, on the principle of "the greater the
sinner the greater the saint."

Having thus initiated himself into the spiritual
fraternity, he may write a work to prove that
the "Church damns more souls than she saves."[6]
He then mounts the rostrum as a burning and a
shining light. He deals in brimstone, wholesale,
retail, and for exportation. Now he unites his
spiritual with secular power, and mixes parliamentary
logic with divinity, electioneering squibs with
"Hymns of the Chosen;" makes Lucifer cuckold,
and swears himself his true liege man on the
cross-buttock of a radical candidate. He now
receives the degree of D.D. from a Scotch university,
for 7l. 13s. 6d., and begins to feel as "big
as bull-beef;" his lank hair curls; he has red
velvet cushions to his tub; he begowns and belappets
[104]
himself; he looks on all sides for an half-idiot
heiress, or infatuated widow in a state of
fatuity, and marries. Thus he jumps into his
bishopric, makes religion a "good spec," till it is
found out he has had "two wives" before, and
a variety of miniature portraits of himself:       and
thus ends his Practice.



PRACTISING FOR THE OPERA.



[105]
RULE XIII.
BARTER       BUYING AND SELLING       PROFIT AND
LOSS.

Man is a "forgiving animal," and this is a better
definition of him than Plato's "biped without
feathers," which the plucked cock demonstrated.
Man is the only animal which strikes a bargain.
A dog does not exchange a bone with another dog;
and however skilful he may be at a steak, he is not
at all clever at this sort of "chop."

"Our chops are our masters," says Hobbes; and
it is all "a matter of wittles," says Sam Weller.
Hence arise the art and mystery of swapping,
buying, and selling, and the notion of trade and
commerce.

England is per se a nation of shopkeepers       we
do every thing upon the principle of small profits
and quick returns. To barter the national honour
[106]
is legitimate policy; to sell up our enemies has
been a practice since the days of the Plantagenets.



"Jocky of Norfolk, be not too bold,
For Dickon thy master is bought and sold."


Hence we can always buy our enemies, if we
cannot beat them. Buonaparte, according to the
radicals, was sold at Waterloo; we have been recently
sold to the Russians; and thus British gold
has been always more powerful than British steel.





D'ye buy, d'ye buy, d'ye buy,
A sheep's head or a lamb's eye.


Ten thousand thanks will be given to any influential
gentleman who will procure the advertiser
a place of commensurate value under government:
an under lord of the treasury, a commissioner of
excise, a distributor of stamps, a head clerkship, or
any other situation, in which the principal duties
are to receive the salary.





Here is your lolly pops and real
Wellington brandy balls, sixteen a penny
As long as there is any.


[107]
Appointments in the army secured without risk,
loss, or trouble to the purchaser. Cornetcies,
Ensigncies, Lieutenancies, Colonelcies, to be disposed
of, at the lowest possible prices. Also a few
cast-off ribbons, stars, spurs, and garters, to be had
a bargain.





One a penny buns,
Two a penny buns;
One a penny,
Two a penny,
Hot cross buns.


The next presentation to a valuable rectory, to
be had for a song. A title for orders, "cheap as
dirt." Degrees may be obtained of A.M., LL.D.,
D.C.L. and D.D., on reasonable terms; and
livings wholesale, retail, and for exportation.
Apply at the "Bottle-nose Head," York; or at the
"Frigasseed surplice," Canterbury.





Here's your spiced gingerbread,
All hot, all hot;
Taste 'em and try 'em,
Before you buy 'em;
All hot, all hot, all hot.


[108]
Comfortable and respectable sittings at Beelzebub
Chapel, Brimstone Alley, St. Luke's, under
an able minister, by the quarter, month, or year.
Pews to hold eight, 2l. 12s. 6d. per annum; single
sittings, 10s. The Pewseyites will have the right
of election and other privileges.       N.B. No connexion
with the parish church next door.





Cat's meat, dog's meat;
Dog's meat, cat's meat.


To be sold, peremptorily, the property of a
gentleman about to travel, (once a rum cove, now
a Sidney cove,) a five-year old hunter, the most
splendid horse in Europe, with grand action.
Got by Spavin out of Roarer, grandsire Glanders,
grandam Botts, warranted sound and without fault;
(blemishes are not faults, but misfortunes;) gentle
to ride, quiet to drive, warranted to do fourteen
stone, or any other weight. Price 120 guineas.       No
abatement.





To the highest bidder,
Here's your rich and ripe faggots,
A penny a piece, a penny a piece;
Here's your savory faggots.


[109]
Sale by auction, in Smithfield. Without reserve.
A most eligible and desirable lot. Coming in low.
Parasol, bustle, and baggage included. My better
half. Weight, sixteen stone. Has taken the lead at
All Max. Temper, mild (horse-radish). Eloquence,
Broughamatic. Voice, Saffernhillish. Person, Nixmydollyish.
Talons, cataclawdish.       No abatement.



The idea of trade and commerce naturally leads
us to the consideration of the sublime science of
Political Economy, which endeavours to dogmatize
that profound conundrum, that the natural rate
of wages is that which barely affords the labourer the
means of subsistence, and of continuing the race of
labourers       meaning thereby, the starvation point
at which a labourer can be worked. It is assumed
that the labourer has so much work in him, and the
problem is to draw it out at the least possible cost       of
whip or legal enactment       or police forces
or military expenditure.

Another leading doctrine of the political economists
is, the fatal necessity of starvation. It is
maintained, and that seriously, that "God, when
he made man, intended that he should be starved;"
that human fecundity tends to get the start of the
[110]
means of subsistence; that the former moves
as 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64; but the latter only as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8. The consequence drawn from this proposition
is, that poor-laws, or any efforts of charity, are
only a childish indulgence of feeling; for since
there will be a surplus number, who must at all
events be starved, if the life of one is saved by
charity, whether public or private, it is only that
another may be starved in its stead. Hence the
perishing of annual multitudes may be looked upon
as a proof of the national wealth; and the poor-law
system, and the Queen's Letter, but so much concern
utterly useless; and the only remedy for our
abundant population is for us to return to the
system of the ancients, and legalize a few Herods,
or, to go further back, to make every man a Saturn       the
eater of his own children.



[111]
RULE XIV.
DISCOUNT.

Discount is the allowance made to a person, for
paying money before it is due; so says Walkinghame;
but there are now few persons who commit so
egregious a folly, the plan being not to pay until
it has been due a long time, and then get discount
as for ready money.

The usual manner of settling accounts in the
City is to purchase for ready money; to give a
bill at three months, which is to be considered as
equal to ready money; and when the bill becomes
due to give       the cash? No! but another bill at
five months. This is called cash payments.

[112]
Leaving the City, as being "vulgar," let us look
at discount by the broad light of Universality.
Discount means something "taken off," or reduced
by so much, or decreased in value, or lessened.



"DISCOUNTING FOR A MAN FORMERLY."

A man is said to be at a discount on 'Change,
when he has no change at the Bank; when he has
no banker in the City; when "no effects" is written
on his "mandible:"       at Almack's, when he ceases
to invite dinner eaters; among the ladies, when grey
hairs and crows' feet make their appearance, and
teeth their disappearance.



[113]
Par, above par, below par. We are at par,
when in that blessed state of equanimity found in
perfection at a Quakers' meeting; above par, when
floundering about in champagne; and below par,
when cooling down on water gruel and Seidlitz.

Examples of discount at the present moment
are too numerous to mention. Every thing seems
at a discount; radicals, dissenters, theatricals, fine
arts, scientificks, trade, commerce, manufactures.
Asses' heads alone are looking up.



[114]
RULE XV.
INVOLUTION AND EVOLUTION.

Involution and Evolution are two rules of
arithmetic which signify getting in and getting
out. Involution signifies such matters as getting
in love, getting into a lawsuit, or getting into
debt. It is the rule of entanglement, and is
represented by a fly in a spider's web.

Evolution comprehends all the tricks, shifts,
schemes, and stratagems, by which we get out of
our various difficulties; but it may be observed that
it is much easier to become involved in any matter,
than to get disentangled: whatever may be our
evolutions, it is a difficult matter to get out of love,
out of a law-suit, or out of debt.

[115]
LAW EVOLUTION       GETTING INTO A LAW-SUIT.



"Will you walk into my office," said the lawyer, Mr. Sly,
"'Tis the prettiest little office that ever you did spy.
The way into my office is by a winding stair,
And I've a many funny things to show you when you're there."
"But I have heard," the client said, "you sport a web and chain,
And he who in your office gets comes not out clear again."


"I'm sure you must be weary, friend, of everlasting dunning;
Come, rest upon my legal wit, my gammon, and my cunning.
I'll get your debt at little cost, so only let me do it;
Or else perhaps the chap will break, and you will have to rue it."
"I'd rather not       I'd rather not," the wary client said;
"For I did never like to throw 'good money after bad.'"


"Leave all to me," the lawyer now with eloquence replied;
"A fig for costs, your case is clear, and you have me beside;
I'll take the case at any odds, and rather be dependent
Upon the issue of the whole       that is, on the defendant."
"Well, try it on," the client said, "you are a lad of wax;
So stick to him with tape and string       succeeding, we'll go snacks."

[116]

Then in the legal mesh and web of cunning Mr. Sly,
The client now was fairly caught as any little fly;
And round him twined all legal quirks, and briefs a dozen quire,
Writ, declaration, cognovit, bail, habeas, præmunire.
"You've lost the cause!" the client cried       "the loss to you, not me."
"Hum, ha       but stop a bit," said Sly       "stop, stop, and we shall see."


The lawyer mended now his web, and thread by thread he lengthened;
Made closer every mesh and hole, and every corner strengthened.
"The cause is lost, and you must pay       I bargained if I gained it;
You cannot think on other terms that I could have sustained it."
So round the hapless wretch he threw a law cord strong and good;
And thus he held it, hard and fast, and sucked his client's blood.


GETTING INVOLVED, OR IN DEBT.

The ways of getting into debt are multiform. To
be involved is patriotic, fashionable, genteel, and sentimental.
To pay is vulgar, inconvenient, and unpopular.
[117]
The man who lives within his means is never
considered to have any means. A man in debt
possesses an interest and an importance truly
pleasurable. It is surely something to know that
in your little self a hundred are subject to hopes,
fears, anxieties, speculations, aspirations, and a
world of such like poetry. The greater the number
of creditors, the greater must be the sensation
produced; and the production of a sensation is
every thing in fashionable society.

The old proverb was, "Out of debt out of
danger;" but modern arithmetic teaches, "In debt
out of danger;" the law of debtor and creditor
being fashioned according to this maxim, which is
now the Lex Scripta of the courts. To be over
head and ears in debt, is the best security; "debt
is the safest helmet." To be not worth powder
and shot, or to make believe you are not, is the
best method of keeping on the wing. It requires,
however, some curious evolutions to enable an
empty sack to stand upright.

LOVE EVOLUTION, OR GETTING IN LOVE.

This is an involuntary process, and an entanglement
equally powerful with the meshes of
[118]
the law. In this case, however, the pleasure
increases with the entanglement, as the fly
said in the honey-pot. The arms of a fair lady
are the softest bonds; the poison of a maiden's
lip the sweetest poison. To be in love is to
be entangled in a cobweb of ten thousand
ecstasies, where every string is bliss, and every
mesh is beauty. In this web, Cupid sits as an
angel in one corner, and Hymen on the other; thus
bound with sighs, tied with kisses, linked by
embraces, chained by tears, lovers disport themselves;
till Hymen, in fear that they should die of
ecstasy, tightens the web, and binds them hand and
foot in the true lover's knot of matrimony.

PARLIAMENTARY EVOLUTION.


Rule      1.Make up your mind to "go the whole hog" with your party.
2.Flatter, gammon, and gloze all parties.
3.Humbug your opponents, and cheat your supporters.
4.Make love to every prevailing vagary of the day, and coquet with Mother Church, and her fantastical daughter, Miss Dissent.
[119]5.Promise every thing, perform nothing, and be the last year of your parliamentary term a contradiction of the six preceding years, so as to ensure another return.


HOW TO GET INTO PARLIAMENT.

Supposing yourself to be a green yokel, just raw
from school, with little wit, little money, and little
influence, act as follows:       

1. Marry for the sake of respectability and a
little more money.

2. Give away soup to the poor, flannel petticoats,
trusses, and baby linen.

3. Set up schools on the free system, "every
boy his own archbishop:" Free-trade in religion,
and no walloping.

4. Get into a squabble with your Rector, about
free grace and non-election.

5. Write once a week in the dissenters' "slop
pail," against clerical intolerance, tithe pigs, "red
noses," round paunches, lawn sleeves.[120]

6. Attend the jawy jobations of Exeter hall, as
a "flowery speaker," and advocate various Jew,
Gipsy, Voluntary Church, Anti-pseudo-baptistical
Societies, till you are black in the face.

7. Join the Society for the Diffusion of Useless
Knowledge, the Donkey Protecting Society, and
other congenial "Institutes."

8. Build a chapel, and bribe a congregation to
come to it. Become a teetotaller; be a betwixt
and betweenish, half-and-half, out-and-out radical.
Defeat the imposition of a Church rate       rave
against the taxes       pledge yourself to support
triangular parliaments, universal suffering       blindfold
voting       and confusion to all order.



And thus get in, get in,
By clamour, bawl, and shout;
To tax 'em then begin;
Oh then get out, get out.


Get in, get in, get in,
Give place to sneak and lout,
And don't forget your kin;
Oh then get out, get out.

[121]

Get in, get in, get in,
Get jolly fat and stout,
And grind the people thin;
Oh then get out, get out.


Get in, get in, get in,
And turn and twist about,
Until some precious shin       
Dy       says, "Get out, get out."





[122]

MEASURING BY THE "YARD"       TRUE FIT.

RULE XVI.
DUODECIMALS;
OR,
THE MEASURING OF PAINTING, PLASTERING, JOINING,
GLAZING, GLOZING, AND OTHER FLAT WORK.

Duodecimals teach us to find the superficial
contents of any "thing." A thing is properly
[123]
something, neither woman nor man; possessing all
the superficial of either, and the substantials of
neither: such as numbsculls, lordlings, quacks,
empirics,      c.

Duodecimals also teach the mensuration of plastering,
painting and glazing; which comprehend the
arts of palaver and gammon, and the science of
Flattery in general.

This is, above all others, a "superficial age,"
and the mensuration of superficies is characteristic
of the modern era       the age of meretricious
flummery. Our science is superficial thinking;
our morality, superficial blinking. Every thing is
made now-a-days for the "surface," which, like
the gilded wooden organ pipes, placed in front of
that instrument, are not made to blow, but for
the sake of show. In learning, we get a smattering
instead of the real thing; and we drop the
meat for the sake of the shadow. The deep and the
solid have long ago been discarded: in short, this
is the age of gammon, and society is like a quire
of "outsides foolscap."



Of Flat Surfaces.       A plane or flat surface has
length and breadth without thickness. Flat
[124]
surfaces are often made, by some peculiar property
of polarized light, to reflect rays which do
not belong to them. Thus, flats pass for solids,
and "shallows" for "deep-uns."



[125]
RULE XVII.

BOOK-KEEPING AND ACCOUNTS.

Book-keeping is not to be understood only as
the art of "Book-borrowing," a very good science
in its way, but as the highest branch of the science
of legerdemain, invented for the express purpose of
enabling the speculative to conceal their accounts,
just as the use of speech is given to man to enable
him to conceal his thoughts.

We have excellent directions given us on this
head from very high authority, which is to be understood
according to the Benthamite Philosophy.
"How much owest thou my lord? And he said,
A hundred measures of oil. Take thy bill, and
sit down quickly, and write fifty." Hence the
children of the philosophers are wiser than the
children of light.

In "keeping books" it is not only indispensable
that you should keep them, but that they also
should "keep you." This is in accordance with
[126]
the free-trade reciprocity system; and to enable
them to do it requires but little tact. For instance,
you open a shop       not for the purpose of doing
business, but for doing some unfortunate flat, in the
very spirit of a "Good-will;" so that when your
business is done, your client may find his business
done too, and when you have taken yourself off,
he may find himself taken in. This example may
be repeated any number of times.

Upon entering life, every young man must
consider that it will be quite impossible to live
without some "cash in hand;"       that he will, at
times, be inevitably called upon to "fork out,"
"dub up," or "come down;"       and that in all transactions,
such as swelling and dashing, cutting and
flashing, it will be necessary to keep a sharp look-out
upon the "blunt," tin, or pewter, as it is
variously termed; if not for your own satisfaction,
at least for your beloved father's, whom you are
in duty bound to bamboozle. There are certain
items which never need come into this account;
namely, board, lodging, tailor's bills, boots, shoes,
linen, horses, and such like necessaries; these
belong religiously to the old boy, or are fit and
proper matters for "whitewashing."

[127]
To fulfil this purpose, open a cash account,
putting Dr. in the left hand corner, which signifies
Dear Father, in honour of your respected parent,
or in testimony that everything is dear; and
Cr. on the right hand, which may signify "cruel
little I have to spend." This is called the Waste
Book. The items introduced are merely hints for
the getting and disbursement of Cash.

Having been thus initiated in the making out of
personal accounts, the pupil must now turn his
attention to the methods of Book-keeping adopted
by "gentlemen in difficulties," connected with that
peculiar process of law which professes to put
new wind into a collapsed bladder, and enable an
empty sack to stand upright. The example is
called taking the "Benefit;" the principal part
of which is making out a Schedule, which may be
done as follows:

Notwithstanding the copious examples above
given, there is one other kind of Book-keeping
which can only be thoroughly understood by the
first accountants, and is only practised by the
first of practitioners. This is making up a book

CHARLES I.       A BLOCK-HEAD.


RULE XVIII.
SOLID MEASURE.

We have already treated on "superficial measurement;"
we now come to "Solid Measure."
Solids are, in general, what are termed "blockheads,"
[141]
or "thickheads," or "bumbleheads," or
"numbsculls," exemplified in "senior wranglers,"
"tripos," "professors of Greek," and teachers of
Latin. The advantages of a thick scull are great.
It was found upon the gauging of Porson's head,
by the heads of his college, that his scull was so
thick that it became the subject of marvel how
knowledge could get in       once in, it was held impossible
to get out. The case is the same with
most of our schoolmen.



Solid Measure has been applied with great
success to the measure of blockheads by Messrs.
Gull and Spuzzy, Epps, Ham and Co. The
measure is now principally performed by a Scotch
"Combe," consisting of four "bushel-heads" in one.
This instrument, the length and breadth and
thickness of a head being given, will work out the
solid contents and capacity of the understanding,
to the fraction of a fraction.

The science so formed upon the measure of
wooden heads was invented by Albertus Magnus,
who flourished in the thirteenth century and made
a wooden man with a wooden head, dividing it into
[142]
sixty-eight orders or ratios. Gull and Spuzzy,
however, finding this large number bother them,
took away thirty-three, sans cérémonie, observing,
"Organum botheratio sive ambarum rationum
mistura fortuita effervescens, bullas gignens." But
the whole scull is now mapped out into thirty-six
compartments, and subjected to a trigonometrical
survey, and a barometrical admeasurement of comparative
heights and hollows.

These divisions are so delightfully situated, that
from Combativeness, the organ of fighting, we enter
Friendship, (Adhesiveness,) without a turnpike
between. Acquisitiveness, the love of money, is
next-door neighbour to Ideality, the quality of
poets, who generally show so much contempt for it.
Constructiveness, the organ of building, lies as a
foundation for that of Music, and handy for the
grating of saws, the knocking of hammers, and the
squeaking of wheelbarrows, as accompaniments
to Haydn's symphonies. Metaphysics are also
handy for wit. Ideality is a parallelopiped,
Hope is a square, Cautiousness a circle, Eventuality
a semicircle; then we have cones, rhomboids,
trapeziums, polygons, hexagons, decagons;
[143]
while Language, like the science itself, is all
my eye.[8]

Thick-heads, block-heads, bumble-heads, or
basket-heads, which used in former days to be
symbols of obesity, and gave rise to the maxim,
"Great head, little wit," are now the indications of
intellectual superiority. "The bigger the head the
greater the genius," as the mushroom said to the
cucumber; and to have a head as big as a baker's
basket, or the bustle of a lady mayoress, is perfection.

To fumble these heads is the business of the
Feelosophers; so called from feel, to fumble, os,
a bone, and pher, far from the truth. This science
being at our fingers' ends, a great advantage is felt
in all the transactions of life, as the most tender
ideas maybe expressed with mathematical certainty,
numerically, figuratively, and arithmetically, as
follows:       

[144]
A BUMPOLOGICAL LOVE-LETTER.

Divine Louisa,

I need not remind you that last night
I felt (not emotions, raptures, and soul-thrilling
transports) but your BUMPS. On returning home
I also felt my own, and I hasten to inform you
that while 17 is throbbing like an earthquake,
all my 33 is insufficient to describe my state, on
finding that a kind Providence has ordained that
for every bump on your beloved head, there rises
a corresponding bump on mine. I 18 you do not
see them, and in 16 declare that my No. 11 only
centres in you.

I do not wish to give a false 26 to what
I say, but in the 30 of your becoming mine,
my No. 1 will develop No. 2, and all my No. 3
will be directed to 14 for your 13. Dearest
girl, need I say more? Nos. 2, 3, 4, are so
harmoniously protuberant in both of us, that
I can have no doubt of either a large or a happy
home. Your 23 and 24, and the 26 on your
[145]
cheeks, are indeed divine. Sweet soul, do allow
your 13 to name as soon as possible your 31 and
27, that no untoward 30's may cross our 17's.

Yours, from 1 to 36,
Bobby Bumpas.

[146]

"ASSURANCE."


RULE XIX.
ASSURANCE       INSURANCE.

Assurance or Brass is a rule of the utmost
consequence in all monetary transactions; by it
miracles have been performed from the earliest
ages. A good stock of assurance, i. e. impudence,
[147]
will carry a man further than even a stock of
money, wit, or learning. The brazen head of
Friar Bacon, by which he is said to have performed
such wonders, was nothing more than a typical
personification of the brass, assurance, or impudence
of the conjuror. The present prima facie economic
method is to wear a brazen face with a wooden
head. Mettle, it is true, may be necessary, but
"cheek" is indispensable.

Modesty is an antiquated virtue, to be repudiated
above all others; and humility is only fit for
charity-school boys, who learn the "catechiz."
But even among these the notion of "humbly,
lowly and reverendly," will soon be exploded by
the music and dancing system; the new philosophy
of the times being, "Jack's as good as his master"
and a "tarnation sight better;" every one feels
this assurance.

Be assured, gentle readers, there is nothing like
brass; it enables a man to put his best leg forward,
and a good face upon any thing. Brass is the
true philosopher's stone, which turns all it touches
into tin. By it the insignificant makes himself
important, the empiric becomes a professor, the
smatterer a proficient, the mountebank a philosopher,
[148]
and the quack an oracle; in short, by this
rule, "fools rush in where angels fear to tread."

The rule of Assurance is founded upon the fact,
that there are no bounds to human credulity; well
sustained assumption, with a very small amount of
gumption, being alone requisite for miracles in
commerce, trade, politics, or religion.

EXAMPLES OF "ASSURANCE."

1. Calling on a friend in cold weather, make
bold to "roast the boiling piece," by placing your
fundamental basis before his parlour fire; lean
your back against his "marble," scrape your shoes
on his fender, and puff your cigar to the detriment
of his elaborate ornaments and gimcracks; as to
his wife and children being excluded from the fire,
let that be "a part of your religion," fieri facias.

2. Should you be invited to dinner, when you
enter the house, walk at once into the dining-room,
and make yourself at home by pulling off your
boots, calling for a clean pair of shoes, a newspaper,
[149]
a cigar, and the arm chair; you may nod to the
mistress of the house, and say "How do" to the
juveniles, if you do not wish to be taken for a brute.

3. Should you call at the house of a friend,
during his absence, do not hesitate to mount his
best horse, and take a twenty miles' ride for the
sake of exercise. When you return, you can "stop
dinner" with his wife, and afterwards take her to
the Opera.

4. On entering a country church, always patronise
the clergyman's or the squire's pew; should
any ladies be present, you may take out your eyeglass
and quizz them with a vacant stare,       they
will probably suppose you to be an unknown
friend;       politely hand the fair devotees the prayer
and hymn-book; you may also hum the bass in
chords to the ladies' treble; when you depart, be
sure to make a very low congee, as it will mark
you for a gentleman.

5. Should you, by any chance, be introduced to a
new acquaintance, you may, at the expiration of a
week, jerrymediddle him by the question       "You
[150]
have not got such a thing as five pounds about
you, have you?" A person, who prefers your
society to solitude, can have no objection to a
loan; you can then make yourself as scarce as
asparagus at Christmas.



MUTUAL ASSURANCE.


[151]
ASSURANCE COMPANIES.

Assurance is displayed to perfection in modern
Assurance Companies; and it only requires
assurance to raise a company as baseless as the
emasculated minus of No. I., and as fabrickless as

[155]
It is proposed to form the company of the above
"Live Stock," the members of which are each to
possess a share in each other. The young maids'
class, No. 1, beauty, rank, and fortune, being the
highest prizes       there are supposed to be a hundred
of such prizes. The second class of prizes is rich
old widows, with short lives, of which there are
also a hundred. The third class of prizes is rich
old maids, of which there are also a hundred. The
fourth class comprehends beauty and intelligence;
the fifth, beauty only; and so on in a sliding
scale, but all prizes.

The male stock also comprehends a reciprocity
system of prizes:       1st class, of the whiskered; 2d,
no whiskered; 3d, monied and whiskered; and so on
to widowers, with or without families, down to
that least of all valuable of the genus homo, old
men-women.

RULES.

Each subscriber of a pound annually to have
one ticket, which shall entitle him to draw for
each of the prizes on the 1st of April in every
year, at Exeter Hall, under a commission selected
from the "Lumber Troop."

[156]
The parties so fortunate as to draw a prize will
have an introduction to the subject of it, and a
match will be negotiated, if possible, without
delay. Should the parties not suit each other,
they will, upon the payment of another guinea,
be privileged to draw again. But it is assumed,
from a careful examination of matrimonial statistics
drawn up by Dr. Lardner, that the matter of
suitability will never be taken into consideration.

To facilitate its objects, a Normal seminary will
be attached to the society, and a registrar engaged
to marry at a reduced price, "that is, by
the score."

Billy Blowmetight, Secretary.



[157]
RULE XX.
STOCKS, FUNDS,      c.

The monetary system of England is the ideal
philosophy of political economists, who, in the conviction
that "nothing exists," think it no "matter"
to found a variety of hypotheses to give tangibility
to the intangible, substance to accident, and reality
to the abstract; in short, to personify "nothing."

These intangible tangibilities bear various names,
such as Consols, Bank Stock, Indian Stock, Long
Annuities, Exchequer Bills,      c. The aggregate of
these 0 0 0 0 0 noughts are, by a peculiar process
of national arithmetic, made to amount to Stock
or Funds.

[158]
Stocks or Funds are the true substantials.
In the golden ages of the world, cattle, corn, and
merchandise were the medium of exchange among
nations; but as men grew more enlightened, they
agreed to represent these things by pieces of conventional
metal. This at last becoming scarce,
the world would have fallen into a state of hapless
and irrecoverable ruin, but for the idea of a fictitious
representation of a representation, of a non-existent
which might have been.

Funds are therefore the to kalon, the absolute,
the logos, the never-to-be-apprehended, the inscrutable,
the supreme totality of "emptiness," the
absolute cause, the absolute effect, the absolute
concurrence of national faith; in short, the commercial
"ideal" which all men worship, in its
temples of the Bank and Stock Exchange.

Stocks are the "heaven of this religion," an agreeable
hallucination, by which a variety of insane persons,
called Stockholders or Fundholders, are permitted
to roam at large under the conviction that
they possess wealth. The public are compelled
to believe in these fictitious representations,
which are the foundation of the "imaginative
system" in fiscal affairs, of the Bill and Credit
[159]
system in commerce, and of the National
Debt.

In England there is nothing truly national but
this debt, or dead weight, which is the mighty
pendulum which makes the national clock "go
upon tick." It is the true foundation of political
economy and of social faith or trust; "'pon tick"
is the basis of the wealth and happiness of our
country, which it makes the envy of the world and
the glory of surrounding nations.

To be in debt argues credit, and credit respectability,
and respectability means, and means resolve
themselves into the Funds; here they merge into
the blessed obscurity of "nothingness," and being
absorbed by the same media, pass for a "something"
which is far more formidable than "anything."
Thus private wealth moves in a circle
continually, making the round O from 0 (nothing)
to 0 (nothing.)



Joint Stock.       Joint Stock Companies are so
called from the projectors being generally "black
legs," and their victims "raw Jemmies." The
object of such companies is to give honesty the
[160]
"cross buttock," to have a "shind eye" with
capital, and to end in an "offal" bankruptcy.

From a consideration of the immediately preceding
rules, and assuming as a fact the spiritual
and ethereal nature of stock or capital, it is therefore
proposed to found a Joint-Stock Company of
unlimited capital, to be called the Boreal Pneumatic
Joint-Stock Company, for "raising the wind,"
and making "darkness visible," or the National
"Puff" Company.

Raising the wind has been the great problem
of all financial operations. It is of far more
importance than "raising the dead." The "wind"
is a conventional term for the "needful." It is
called wind because it is raised by various "Puffs."

There are various kinds of Puff; the Puff
National, the Puff Medical, the Puff Legal, the
Puff Literary, the "Puff Theatrical," and the
Puff Scholastic.

THE PUFF NATIONAL       A ROYAL SPEECH.

My Lords and Gentlemen,       The flourishing
state of my empire having filled me with the most
intense satisfaction, I have called you together to
[161]
inform you that we are the envy of the world and
glory of surrounding nations, and that everything
is so plentiful that pigs run about the streets
ready roasted, with carving knives and forks stuck
in their backs, crying, "Eat me, eat me!"

I continue to receive from foreign powers the
most friendly intercourse, and an assurance that
they have unanimously agreed to sink their own
national interests in a regard for my welfare; and
in this I am certain there is no "gammon."

The Commercial and Mercantile interests are
in such a state of convalescent perfection, and
gold is so plentiful, that I have ordered a commission
to consider of the propriety of paving
with it the various thoroughfares of the metropolis,
in lieu of Blockheads.

Owing to a great improvement in Benevolent
affairs, it is with pleasure I have to inform you
that the Public Societies have given up their
vested rights, dues, peculations, and pickings,
for the benefit of the poor, (should there be any
such,) and will henceforth "preach without
Profit."

Owing also to the general distribution of wealth
among all classes, I have been enabled to divest
[162]
physic of its fees, and law of its charges; and both
these professions will for henceforth be conducted
"free gratis" and "for nothing."



Gentlemen of the House of Commons,       Through
the practice of the most rigid economy in
every branch of my establishment, I have directed
to be laid before you an account of the sums paid
into the Exchequer, being the surplus of my revenue;
and I have further to inform you that taxation
being no longer necessary, the expense of a house
of commons may be dispensed with, and the large
sums usually paid in "bribery at elections," I
trust will be left to fructify in the pockets of the
members.

This constitutional determination on my part,
for the benefit of my people, has arisen from my
being called, by Divine Providence, to a sense of
my true estate of a State pauper, which has led
me to reduce my dietary and that of my household
to that of the Poor-Law Unions, and to
introduce teatotality into every department; and I
have great gratification in being able to announce,
that as I have now lost "having a shadow" to my
royal personality, I may myself be shortly expected
[163]
to evaporize, and the expense of a monarchy may
be saved for the future.



My Lords and Gentlemen,       With and by the
advice of my Privy Council, I have determined
upon putting into execution the hydrostatic paradox,
or cold water cure, in and upon that part of
my dominions called Ireland; and a commission
consisting of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal
has been issued for laying that "flower of the earth
and gem of the sea" "under water" for the space
of one month, as the best method of extinguishing
the torch of discord, the fire of malevolence, and
the smoke of sedition, and of allaying all ferment
upon Atlantic if not upon pacific principles.

I rely confidently upon the wisdom of my
Parliament to enable me to carry out my beneficent
intentions of subjecting all my people to
"live upon air," as the symbol of true freedom, and
as the most liberal and inexpensive method of
obviating the evils which have hitherto surrounded
my throne and government; and I would submit
to your serious consideration the expediency of
establishing a training school at Exeter Hall, for
teaching wind instruments to all my subjects, and
[164]
for the arrangement of airs corresponding to the
various meals, feasts, and dishes of every day life;
and I indulge the anticipation that the substitution
of oxygen for oxen, and gas for Gastronomy, will
be conducive to the health, wealth, and prosperity
of my empire.

This Company is established in consequence of
the lamented deficiency in the scholastic profession;
[166]
and its object is to manufacture schoolmasters of
a very superior character, at a cheap rate, from
various "refuse" articles of all trades and professions       technically,
the "unfit" or good-for-nothing.

In consequence of a profound investigation of
the science of education, it has been discovered
that those who are unable to conduct any other
business, are the best adapted to "teach the
young idea how to shoot;" and therefore cast-off
cobblers, tailors, teachers, and drapers, shop-boys
and errand-boys, will be received into the establishment
at the rate of a guinea a-week; where,
by the aid of educational galvanism, their misdirected
faculties will be sublimed, their ideas
topsiturvied, their moral and intellectual nature
turned inside out, their understandings new
vamped, soled, and welted, and their minds infused
with a succedaneum of intellectual electricity,
which shall evaporate itself in the mixed mathematics,
pedagogicks, whackbackics, pancakeatics,
tickletobyatics, and all other scholastic sciences.

Candidates must bring personal recommendations,
of a squint, a slouch, a leer, a game leg, a
hump back, or any other accomplishments. Should
[167]
they be unfortunately destitute of these, they may
produce testimonials of fitness from their washerwomen;
but those who do not indulge in the
luxury of a clean shirt may be recommended by
the teacher of any Social sect to which they may
belong. These certificates must certify them to
be bumble headed, addle-pated, numbsculled, good
for nothing else; that they wear dickeys and are
donkeys.

Upon entering the Institution the seminants
will be forced to forget everything they ever
knew, by a machine invented by Mr. Combe for
"Razing out the errors of the brain," and which
has been used with the happiest effects at the
Glasgow Normal Establishment.       A perfect Tabla
Rasa being thus produced in vacuo, on Locke's
principle, the professors will commence teaching
their pupils to know a great A from a bull's
foot, how many beans make five, and other
branches of the pure mathematics.

As all the seminants will be naturals, Natural
Philosophy will be a principal object of study, and
the mechanical system of Dr. Lardner will be the
text-book. History will be imparted through the
renowned histories of "Jack the Giant Killer,"
[168]
"Jack and the Bean Stalk," "The Ogre and his
Seven-leagued Boots," and the "Newgate Calendar,"
under the superintendence of John Ketch,
Esq.; Morality and Esthenics through the medium
of "Ovid's Art of Love," "Basia," and "Little's
Poems;" while the Principles of Science will be
imparted through the "Boxiana," by Professor
Cribb, assisted by the celebrated Scotch terrier,
"Fudge."

Religion being in the highest degree essential,
it cannot be dispensed with without endangering
the safety of the Company. But as there are
so many different sects of religionists, and so many
differences in the sects, it is proposed to teach
religion by machinery, on the comprehensive accommodation
principle of expediency, by means of
one of Cobbett's cast-iron Independent parsons,
which, being constructed upon the profoundest
principles of neutrality, will satisfy all parties, by
teaching every religion at the same time, and
none in particular: thus Atheism and Methodism
may shake hands together, Mahommedanism and
Calvinism embrace, and Buddhism and every
other schism kiss each other in the true spirit of
Christian liberality and equality.

[169]
Degrees will be granted to those pupils who may
distinguish themselves in flagellation, or a dexterous
use of the cat or tawse, or by proficiency in the
evolutions of cane, strap, or ruler; the degree
of P.W., Professed Walloper, being equal to
that of A.M.

THE PUFF NOVEL.

We are requested to announce that the new
Novel, called the "Bloody-minded Costermonger,
or the Donkey's Apotheosis," having
experienced a sale unprecedented in the annals of
Literature, a new edition is in preparation, worked
[170]
by steam apparatus, to supply the astounding
demand, and will be issued on Saturday next.

"This extraordinary work is creating a sensation
the most intense, as it completely daguerreotypes
nature, penetrates the feelings like the
electric shock, macadamises the heart, and cuts the
soul to shivers."       The Censor.



New Novel by "Snivie." Written seven
months after his decease, by the aid of the galvanic
apparatus.       It having come to the ears of
an experimental philosopher, La Fontaine, that
this great author was no more, and it being
justly surmised that a very large amount of Novel
matter must remain in his system, La Fontaine
undertook the task of extracting it by means of
the mesmeric process, and has succeeded with
wonderful effect. In performing his numerous
experiments the flashes of wit were so intense as
to overpower the anxious publisher, who, in the
intensity of his admiration, has paid so large a
sum for the copyright as to be enabled to add to
the character of the work by charging double.

[171]
THE PUFF THEATRICAL.

It is with the most astounding rapture that the
Manager of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, has
to announce that the new tragedy of "Chandos
the Briber, or the Independent Potwalloper," which
met with the most transcendent success on its
first representation, has been recharged by the
Author with pathetic scenes and tender situations,
abounding with the most overpowering sentiment
and overwhelming pathos. The Manager regrets
that the cascades of tears which fell from the
boxes and gallery during the last representation
should have inconvenienced the "critics in the
pit," and begs to inform them that, for the future,
they shall not sit ankle deep in the "briny flood,"
he having, at a prodigious expense, and by the aid
of a distinguished engineer, succeeded in forming a
grand branch aqueduct, which will receive through
the floor of the house "Nature's gentle droppings,"
and, by an appropriate channel, transmit them to
the back of the stage to a grand reservoir. Thus,
the last scene of the tragedy, which represents the
[172]
bombardment of Stow House by Norfolk dumplings,
will be represented on "real salt water;"
the said salt water being an accumulation of the
tears shed at the preceding scenes of the tragedy.

N. B. It is particularly requested that ladies or
gentlemen in the boxes will refrain from wringing
out their pocket handkerchiefs over the pit, and
that those in the front ranks will discontinue the
practice of "hoisting umbrellas," which must
obviously obstruct a view of the stage.

THE PUFF MERCANTILE.

Reform your Tailor's Bills.       Clothes saved
and Tailors annihilated. "In puris naturalibus."
"Where there is no sin there should be no shame."       Cool
contrivance for warm weather, the fig-leaf
apron, the oldest garment upon record, or the sacred
tunic. This unique and perfect introduction, formed
of the common dock, having been patronised by
the highest authority, will be supplied to all who
value cool comfort and free motion of the limbs, at
a guinea each. To the religiously-disposed it is
[173]
particularly eligible, being the original antique of
Adam and Eve, our first parents, the pattern of
which was found in the archives of Strawberry
Hill. It comes half way to the knee, hangs
simply and elegantly before and behind, and may
be had of various colours to suit the complexion.
It cannot fail to display the fine form of the
limbs, and imparts a degree of interest to the whole
person not to be found in common pantaloons,
and has the advantage of being adapted to both
sexes. Observe,

97        SMOCK ALLEY, SHOREDITCH.        97

N. B. An inferior tunic of cabbage-leaves,
half a guinea.

THE PUFF CLERICAL.

VOLUNTARY CHURCH-GOING COMPANY.

The lamentable neglect of public worship, which
characterises the present generation, being such as
[174]
to call for the most rigorous methods, and it
having been discovered that fine and imprisonment
are insufficient to make the people "religiously
disposed," it is in contemplation to found a Society
or Company which, reprobating the principle of
coercion as unconstitutional in its means, futile in
its ends, shall, by the mild suavity of enticement,
induce the lower classes of this country to seek,
on the Sabbath-day, in preference to all other
places, the Conventicle.

But to do this effectually it will require a sum
of considerable magnitude, which it is proposed to
raise by "sequestration shares," comprising the
amount of 20 millions sterling. The proceeds to
be applied to the objects in view; namely, the
establishment of cook-shops and dining-rooms in
union with the various dissenting places of worship,
to be free, gratis, and for nothing; and it is fondly
anticipated that the savoury scents of the roast, and
the boiled, the fried and the stewed, and the relish
of pies and puddings, will be more efficacious in
inducing the poor to attend to their religious
duties than the red-hot denunciations formerly
employed.

It is a fact too clearly established by the concurrent
[175]
testimony of ages, that those who are bred to
the chapel expect the chapel to be bread to them;
and it is only fair that the poor and needy should
stand in a congenial relative situation.

Subscribers are therefore earnestly solicited in
aid of this great national object, as one of the
best means to put a stop to the spread of infidelity,
to destroy Socialism, to promote the practice of
true piety, and thus add to the safety and security
of the nation.

Names and Subscriptions are to be sent,
addressed to Mr. Cullum Hordly, Gorgon-office,
Fleet-street, London.

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.

"Comic Arithmetic is the best work ever
issued from the press; it is not only multum in
parvo, but a rara avis in terra       a splendid ebullition
[176]
of wit; and the diamond gems of humour which
lie in its depths, sparkle with merriment as the
stream of the Author's feelings glitters over it,
rendering the sensations intense, heart-thrilling,
and side-shaking."       Defunct Gazette.



"Comic Arithmetic.       If we wonder that
the human mind could have conceived such a
project, what must be our astonishment to find all
its beatific visions realized, in such abundant corruscations
of wit and drollery, which irradiate
every page! It is equal in intellectual splendour
to that mental Claude's, Robert Montflummery's
poem, "The Last of the Gewgaws," and resembles
Vauxhall on a gala night, or the illuminations of
St. Peter at the Zollicogical Gardens."       Imaginary
Review.



"Comic Arithmetic is a specific for the
doldrums and a cure for the heart-ache; has been
known to perform a perfect cure on dyspeptic
patients at a single sitting; it is an anodyne for
the gout, an assuager of rheumatism; it may be
called an electrical merry-thought, or the galvanism
of witticism; which, by convulsing with laughter,
[177]
would shake out a legion of blue devils in the
twinkling of a bed-post."       Embryo Magazine.

FOOTNOTES:


[1] See page 19, (Addition,) for a poetical version of this maxim.


[2] Any one wishing to observe this great lesson to all mankind
set forth by the leading journal of Europe, has only to look at the
little vignette at the top of the leading article of the "Times."


[3] Notwithstanding the "pretty considerable declension" of
mercantile integrity, the character of the British merchant, both at
home and abroad, still maintains its ascendency, and there are yet
thousands of "merchant princes" who fully sustain the honour
and glory of our native land. This satire is launched against the
"cutting" commercials of the age.


[4] Whatever may be said of the mode of collecting tithes, nothing
can be said against the "right of tithe." The clergy are the
greatest sufferers, and no consummation is more devoutly to be
wished than an equitable adjustment. As things are at present,
the clergy do not get half their dues, and these are obtained in a
manner well calculated to keep up the idea of a certain person
shearing the hogs, "great cry and little wool."


[5] I can't make wriggle rhyme to fiddle. I have sent it to the
prince of wrigglers, Lord B              , and to the prince of fiddlers,
Mr. P       , but they refer me to Mr. Wordsworth.       T. W.

a "grocer," and still a "grosser" man than his neighbours.

be valuable to get clear out.

in some degree the bumble-head of a Scotch feelosopher. He
made a cast of it, and sent it to the Phrenological Society of
Edinburgh, who pronounced a long dissertation upon it, and gave
the moral and intellectual qualities with extraordinary correctness.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
