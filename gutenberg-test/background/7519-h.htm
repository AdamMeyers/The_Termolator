    <h2>
      Preface
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Uncle, why don't you write the story of your life?" So says my nephew Tom
      to me when he comes in and finds me sitting in a brown study before a
      comfortable fire. I have finally granted his request, for I have spent
      many an hour in relating my thrilling adventures to him and am sure that
      he has enjoyed them and even profited by them. Thus have I been persuaded
      to write this little book in the hope that it will be interesting to
      people as well as to cats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course I am only a cat, but I have tried to be a good one, and I think
      that a good cat is of more use in the world than a bad human being. There
      is no doubt but that cats are important members of almost every household.
      What is home without a cat? Great is the comfort and companionship that
      have been brought by them into the lives of solitary spinsters; earnestly
      and faithfully have they slaved to free homes of destructive rats and
      mice, and have also protected the corn in the farmers' barns. When one
      reads of the terrible loss caused by these rodents, it is astonishing to
      think that their destroyers could ever be ill-used or abandoned. I shall
      quote as nearly as possible from a newspaper which I once heard my master
      reading, so you can see how a good many faithful cats are treated:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    "There are probably few people in the city of Boston
    who realize that over 25,000 abandoned cats and 3,000
    dogs are electrocuted each year by the Animal Rescue
    League, by means of a cage which is charged with a
    strong current of electricity. After entering and the
    door is closed, they die without pain or struggle. June
    is the time of year that people abandon dogs, cats and
    other pets, for at this time they move to the seashore
    and disregard their four-footed friends, leaving them
    to wander in the streets. It is the aim of the Animal
    Rescue League to procure and dispose of all animals
    thus abandoned and, whenever possible, they are provided
    with good homes. There were 27,607 cats rescued
    by the League in 1912 and each year the number
    increases."
</pre>
    <p>
      Oh, the pity of it! This little story will, I hope, appeal to many, as it
      shows how keen are the sufferings of a pampered pet, thrown on its own
      resources and forced to wander day by day without food or water. Surely it
      may save some poor beast from misery, and I sincerely hope that it will
      not have been written in vain.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      The first thing I remember is that all was dark, but that I could feel a
      mother's loving caress and knew that there were other helpless things in
      the same box with me. After several days, something large and strong
      lifted us, box and all, and carried us up into a much more pleasant place;
      I can still remember how good it smelled. Upon opening my eyes the next
      day, I beheld the face of my mother and found that we were seven, and were
      comfortably settled at the rear of a provision store. Mother did not feel
      at all safe; that I could see by the uneasy manner in which she looked
      about her, and started and trembled as people came to look at us. Once, if
      I remember correctly, she tried to bite a small boy who would persist in
      picking me up by the tail. Her claws showed also and she took good care of
      us in many like emergencies. She continued to be uneasy, and one day when
      Mr. Carver, the butcher, had stepped out on business, she took us one by
      one in her mouth, lifting us carefully by the nape of the neck, and
      carried us back into the cellar again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was dark and cold and we did not like it very well, but mother cuddled
      us up in her warm embrace and tried to make us feel that it was best for
      us to be away from people. When Mr. Carver came back and saw the empty box
      he came down into the cellar and scolded poor mother, saying, "Now, old
      lady, I want you and the kittens to stay upstairs, for I am going to give
      them away; besides, I want you to kill the mice which are getting into
      everything up there. You may keep one of your children, however, for we
      need two cats here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother looked worried, but followed as he carried us up again. We remained
      there after that and grew larger and more attractive, so that one by one
      my brothers and sisters were given away, with the exception of Tom's
      father (who stayed at home and lived on the fat of the land, to a good old
      age).
    </p>
    <p>
      Our childhood was bright and happy, for mother taught us many things and
      brought us up well. I remember that there was a door leading from the rear
      of the store into a garden. Sunny days mother would take us out and give
      us lessons in natural history. She taught us not to kill or maim
      song-birds, but said that we could kill and eat field mice or little blind
      moles, although we never saw any of them. She warned us that bees and
      wasps were too heating to the blood, and not to eat them, but if very
      hungry, a grass-hopper was not to be sneezed at; positively no toads,
      however. How we played in the garden, chasing the elusive sunbeams,
      rolling over and over, and learning to box and jump! It all came to an end
      too soon, however, for one day a very neat little girl came in and said
      that her father, who was janitor in a grammar school, wanted a kitten,
      because the mice were getting the best of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She picked me up and I knew at once that I should like her, as she was so
      gentle (some children are very rough and squeeze one so hard).
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Carver parted with me unwillingly, for, as he expressed it, "I was the
      smartest one in the bunch." I said good-by to mother with tears in my
      eyes, for she had been very good to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once she had even defied a dog who came into the store and ventured too
      near our box. I still remember how handsome she appeared with her eyes
      blazing, her arched back, and her open mouth, hissing and spitting at him.
      Her sharp claws could be seen outside of her velvet paws, while we,
      terribly frightened, crouched low and kept quiet. The dog ran away as fast
      as he could, and never returned to trouble us.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had taught us how to catch and kill rats and mice in the stillness of
      the night, and had given us many an object lesson. Thus, when we left her
      we had a knowledge of these things and had also been warned not to steal,
      which, living as we did, in a meat market, had been a very hard task. She
      had likewise taught us to be careful of our appearance, and especially to
      keep clean. This latter she showed us by wetting her paw with her tongue
      and washing her face with it, and, moreover, had told us we need not go
      over our heads and back of our ears unless it looked like rain (so
      considerate of her, for cats, as well as boys, hate to have their ears
      washed). Of course she taught us to hate water and always to step over a
      puddle; to keep good company or none; and above all things not to stay out
      late at night, or walk on back fences. She did not approve of voice
      culture, either, but later I shall relate my sad experiences in that
      direction.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was indeed glad to find that my ambition to have an education was to be
      realized. In my early days at the meat market I used to slip out on the
      sidewalk and try to spell out the words on the daily bulletin blackboards,
      such as "Spare ribs, 25 cents," "Best spring lamb, 30 cents," and "Best
      rump steak, 45 cents." I used to wait until some plump old lady with a
      market basket came along and read these signs. She often scolded, but I
      did not then know why. I have since learned that my childhood was in a
      time when the high cost of living was in everybody's mouth. As I had
      learned so much in that way, I felt that I was able to skip the primary
      grade, and so started in with a great deal of confidence to pick up an
      education. For instance, the fact that I was allowed to roam in the
      various rooms in the evenings permitted me to observe, among other things,
      how the earth revolved on its axis. I often proved this fact by tapping a
      large globe with my paw and watching Africa chase Asia and Asia in turn
      pursue America as it turned swiftly around.
    </p>
    <p>
      The janitor had an office in the basement, and I was supposed to stay
      there during the school session, but I used to creep softly up the
      stairway and listen at the class-room doors. Often the door of a
      dressing-room chanced to be open and I could enter here and watch through
      the crack of the school-room door. I learned to read in this manner, and
      took up arithmetic, which was rather difficult, but I studied hard
      evenings and made good progress, until I came to vulgar fractions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remembering mother's dislike of anything unrefined, however, I closed the
      book and did not dare to go on. I fared very well, for the janitor's wife
      sent me bread and milk, and occasionally bits of fish and meat. I had the
      run of the school at night and consequently could learn a great many
      things while prowling around in quest of rats and mice; in fact, I always
      managed to catch a few and leave them where they could be seen (I did not
      care to eat them) before I settled down to hard study, and so revealed to
      the janitor that I was doing my duty. I used to find some choice tid-bits
      in the desks, some of which opened at the end, and did not lift at the
      top; pieces of cake, numerous pickled limes (for which I did not care),
      and also plenty of cookies, and sometimes a sandwich.
    </p>
    <p>
      I observed by the aid of a mirror standing on the floor in a teacher's
      closet that I was growing large and good-looking; my dark coat was smooth
      and glossy, my white shirt-front set off a well poised head, and I
      possessed as fine a pair of whiskers as ever graced a cat. Of these I was
      extremely proud, but used to keep my entire person well groomed as well as
      that particular portion of my features. I exercised in the school yard in
      order to keep in good form and also took boxing lessons from an
      acquaintance, who occasionally called. I soon began to tire of the school
      life and dull studies, however, and longed to go out somewhat during the
      evening, but the janitor was careful to lock me in the school at eight
      o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening I found that a window on the ground floor had been left open.
      It was but the matter of a moment to vault out and I found myself on the
      street alone at night for the first time in my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remembered mother's advice, but thought that she was rather too
      particular; indeed I felt that I could come to no harm, so walked down the
      street, keeping an eye out for dogs, as mother had warned me to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      I soon perceived that the broad highway was too much exposed for my
      traveling, and so I proceeded into a back yard, jumped a fence, and found
      myself on a back road, where market men deliver their goods. It was really
      quite attractive and sociable, for I came upon a group who seemed to be
      serenading some mutual acquaintance. I had listened to the children
      singing at school, and had looked over the song books, and had even
      practised a few scales. In this way I discovered that I had a very clear
      tenor voice, so I immediately joined the group. They did not seem
      particularly anxious to have me do so, and as I now look back, I can see
      how young and fresh I was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jumping upon a fence, I at once threw out my chest and proceeded to give
      them a tenor solo. I was wholly unprepared for what followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant they all charged at me, howling, spitting, and finally
      succeeded in knocking me from my high position. Down on the ground we
      rolled and struggled. Fur flew! Oh, how they scratched and kicked and
      pummeled me. One bit pieces out of my ears, another gave me a black eye.
      In my agony I thought of mother and that her warnings were right after
      all. I found out afterwards that the object of their serenade was a lady,
      and my fine appearance and good voice made them wild with jealousy. I
      could have put up a good fight against one or two enemies, but an army of
      five proved too much for me. However, I got in a few savage bites and
      scratches, which I think they remembered for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this terrible battle we all gave vocal selections in different
      keys, which could hardly be called pleasing to the ear, and were rewarded
      by a shower of empty bottles, old shoes, hair brushes, and finally some
      unkind person threw a pitcher of ice-water at us, from a window above.
      This last offering served to break up the encounter, as well as the
      pitcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon being invited behind the scenes of a theatre some weeks later, and
      peeping from the wings, I noticed that a young girl (who gave a song and
      dance) was showered with roses, violets and other beautiful flowers. I
      could not understand this great difference as her voice did not sound any
      better than mine, I thought, although it may sound conceited in me to say
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      I finally escaped with the remains of my ninth life and when I got away
      from my new friends (?) I limped painfully back to the school house,
      thinking how glad I should be to clamber in again and nurse my wounds.
      When I reached there and looked for the open window I found to my horror
      that it was closed. What should I do? Too weak to run from an offensive
      dog, must I lie helpless in an open school yard? It was not to be thought
      of.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      I rested awhile and felt a little better. No bones were broken. I could
      walk slowly, and as mother's provision store was not far away, I decided
      to take the risk of finding a cellar window open there. So, painfully
      limping along back streets and resting in dark corners, I arrived at my
      destination at midnight, and found that a window had been left open. It
      was a brave task to jump down but better than staying out all night, so I
      set my teeth and leaped softly in. I was greeted with a snarl and hiss
      which sounded like a bunch of fire-crackers going off, and there was
      mother on guard, standing with arched back in front of a box of newly-born
      kittens in a dark corner. I crept toward her and with a cry of delight she
      recognized me. I told my pitiful story while she gently led me to another
      corner and bade me lie down on some carpeting, near which stood a saucer
      of milk. She lapped my wounds and comforted me with kind words. She said
      she was afraid at first that I was a bad quarrelsome cat, and that it
      almost broke her heart. Judging from remarks that she dropped and as she
      had such sad eyes and sighed so often, I am sadly afraid that father
      himself was not exactly a Sunday-school model. I was stiff and sore the
      next day and stayed in my corner. Mother brought part of her dinner to me,
      but I could not bear to take the food from a nursing mother. The cries of
      the kittens wore on my nerves to such an extent that I wondered if I could
      ever settle down to a domestic life.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as I felt able to go out into the world I did so, for I knew that
      it made extra work for mother to have me there. I therefore took my
      departure, deciding that I should not go back to the school (for after all
      it was a dull place). It is needless to state that I thanked mother for
      her kindness. Notwithstanding my first experience, I was anxious to see
      life so set out with a brave heart, but without friends and no prospects
      of a place to lay my head. Fortunately as it was summer and the nights
      were warm, one could sleep out quite comfortably. I did not look quite up
      to the mark, but knew that time alone would cover the bald places, and
      restore my former agility. In the daytime I did not venture forth, but
      slept most of the time in a quiet nook in a back yard where the people had
      gone away for the summer. At night I came out, and a few uncovered garbage
      pails helped me wonderfully, although it hurt my pride to eat this sort of
      food. I was young and healthy, however, and enjoyed the free life in the
      open air.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made a few good friends, some of whom I have kept to this day. I
      remember that I learned to shun boys, for they were apt to throw stones.
      How they can be so cruel I cannot understand. If they realized how the
      stones cut and sting, they would never use them for missiles and us for
      targets. I nursed a wound on my hip bone for weeks, which was very painful
      and was caused by a boy hitting me with a sharp stone. What satisfaction
      can it be to them? Harming a defenseless animal can surely give none, but
      it always seems a great temptation to them to do so. Once I saw a group of
      small boys stoning a kitten which they had tied to a raft. I was glad when
      a big policeman caught them at it. Dogs and boys were the only drawback to
      what was otherwise a perfect life, and a lazily lounging about one; first
      a feast and then a famine.
    </p>
    <p>
      No matter how intense were the pangs of hunger, I followed mother's advice
      and never ate sparrows or any other birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time I made the acquaintance of a cat who lived in a theatre
      and one night he invited me to go behind the scenes with him. My eyes were
      opened that night. Strange looking girls in stranger looking costumes came
      upon the stage and attempted to dance and sing. The like of this I had
      never seen before (nor, I hope, will I ever again). When their gowns were
      not too short, they were much too loud for my taste, but, nevertheless, it
      seems that people sit for hours watching them rave, dance, and scream.
      These peculiar people were kind to me, though, for I ambled about with
      considerable interest. One young female called out, "Larry, pipe the new
      cat!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I had seen Mr. Carver smoke a pipe and sometimes he would pick me up
      and playfully blow rings of smoke in my face and laugh at me so I scurried
      away for fear I should have to take one of those nasty things in my mouth.
      As I was leaving the theatre one man called out to me to "beat it," and,
      as I could not understand their language, which was not in the text books
      at school, I made good my escape with the kindly help of an old shoe,
      which accompanied me part way. "That is no place for a self-respecting
      cat," I thought, so went out into the night. I was a homeless wanderer,
      but managed to find a quiet corner in a dark alley and soon went to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      I awoke much refreshed, but very hungry as my friend of the theatre had
      neglected to treat me to anything more substantial than a chance to look
      on. Oh, how I longed for a drink of milk or water! I was sorely tempted
      and fell. On a door-step a short distance away was a jar of milk. It was a
      moment's work to tip it over and remove the paper top with a sharp claw. I
      lapped my fill and left some in the bottle for the family. That theft was
      bad enough, but I fell still lower. One day I was very hungry, and
      happened long just as some masons had ceased working, in order to eat
      their lunches. One of the men took the cover from his dinner pail and,
      leaving it open on the ground, walked away for a few minutes. I darted
      quickly to the pail and, to my delight, saw a large slice of corned beef.
      It was quick work to snatch it and run away, and how good it tasted! I ate
      it so fast that I remember I suffered afterwards from indigestion,&mdash;or
      perhaps it was a bad conscience.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Things were going from bad to worse and I was becoming tired of my present
      life, but there did not seem to be any way out of it. When I went back to
      my dark alley I fell asleep, but tossed and turned and was very uneasy. At
      midnight I was aware of hearing hoarse voices whispering together; alert
      and listening I heard two men talking about "lifting some swag." I did not
      know what that was but kept still. One said that he would watch outside
      while the other forced a dining-room window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the job is done quietly," said one, "we can get all the silver without
      waking the family." I then understood the expression, "It takes a thief to
      catch a thief," for after the milk and corned beef episodes I felt like a
      branded criminal. They started out to do their dishonest work and I
      followed, my velvet paws making no noise. They were so intent with
      watching out for policemen that they did not notice me and when they
      looked back I dodged behind trees or posts. I soon found that we were
      getting into a very refined neighborhood, for it had a wide street with a
      park between the sidewalks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men did not walk on the main street but resorted to the alley in the
      rear of the block. They finally stopped and looking up and down,
      cautiously unfastened the gate with a few twists, for it had been locked.
      They were now inside of an enclosure, surrounded by a high fence, and
      where the light did not shine upon this house as on some of the others. I
      sneaked in when the gate was opened and following in the darkness found
      myself under the coping watching one lift the other so that he could reach
      in and unlock a window. Slowly and quietly he raised the sash and stepped
      in while the man below watched, ready to give the alarm if anybody should
      come along. I immediately followed the burglar into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here indeed was a new experience, thought I, as I hid under the
      dining-room table and watched. My mind acted quickly and I decided to take
      a chance, run upstairs and give the alarm. Dodging out of the dining-room,
      I ran into the hall and swiftly up a long stairway and found the master
      And mistress sound asleep in a large room. I went up to the bed, gave the
      Bed clothes a quick tug, uttered a low cry and stepped back out of sight.
      The master jumped up exclaiming, "What was that?" At the same time he
      touched a button on the wall and flooded the house with light. He listened
      intently and hearing a noise downstairs rushed down. I followed in time to
      see the man jump out of the window, leaving on the floor a large sack,
      which was filled with silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master rushed to the telephone and almost before one could turn
      around, several policemen were in the house. I heard him tell them about
      the strange cat who cried out and woke them up, saying that he wanted to
      find me and as I had saved the silver, he would keep me henceforth and
      give me a home. Hearing this made me happy, but I realized that such a
      beautiful house was no place for me, especially in my present condition,
      as I was more of a slum cat than one to grace such a position. I quietly
      slipped out into the night, feeling more hopeless and homeless than ever
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hungry and forlorn, wishing that I was someone's pet, I wandered along,
      looking at the fine houses, wishing that I had a home there, for I did not
      at the time really know what a "square meal" was like, nor did I know what
      a home meant. Neither a provision store nor a school is really a home. In
      fact I have heard of cats who slept on beds and some who had bassinets;
      who sat by open fires and dined on the fat of the land. What is more,
      during my recent wanderings, I met one of these aristocratic animals who
      had lost his way, and he told me great tales of wealth, what his folks
      did, how he went to the seashore every summer, even going in a motor car.
      Oh, how important he felt! He said that he slept in a basket lined with
      down, and, as he wore a very expensive collar, I had no reason to doubt
      him. He had roamed from home and I afterwards heard that a reward had been
      offered for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a regular "sissy" and cried and sniffled when he was obliged to
      stay out all night. I offered him some of my picked up food but he turned
      up his aristocratic nose and said that he always had liver for breakfast,
      cooked to order. Upon asking him what his name was, he proudly replied,
      "Lord Roberts." Two friends of mine (street cats) who were listening,
      turned aside to snicker, and when I looked fiercely around pretended that
      they were only sneezing. One ventured to ask him if he had his
      coat-of-arms engraved on his collar and the other offered to exchange
      visiting cards. He saw that they were making fun of him and it hurt his
      feelings, for I saw him turn away and wipe his eye with one paw, as he had
      evidently left his lace handkerchief at home. They stepped on his toes and
      pushed him about with the intention of picking a fight with him, but he
      had no fighting blood, so they finally let him alone. I tried to assist
      him to find his home, but the majesty of the law intervened, and he was
      carried away in the arms of a stalwart policeman who knew, probably, of
      the reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      This incident opened my eyes to the possibility of a home and made me long
      for one, but my affairs became worse instead of better. I soon reached the
      lowest ebb of despair and if it had not been that I had only one remaining
      life, I should have been tempted to end my existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was sitting down by the docks one day looking at the dirty green water,
      which, by the way, did not appeal to me for suicidal purposes, when I was
      accosted by a kind faced lady who held out her hand to me saying, "You
      poor homeless creature, come with me." Could it be possible that anyone
      wanted me? I could not believe my senses. She drew nearer. I crouched, as
      everyone who had spoken to me recently had either kicked or sworn at me or
      ordered me away in language more forcible than elegant. Consequently I was
      rather doubtful, not knowing whether the hand held out to me would strike
      or caress.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked into her face once more, and seeing peace and happiness there,
      allowed her to take me up gently and place a bag over my wasted body. She
      carried me in her arms to an electric car, which she entered. After we had
      gone some distance, she alighted at a quiet street and stopped before a
      sort of shop over which was a sign which read "Animal Rescue League." Oh,
      joy and happiness! A home at last. It was too good to be true. Once inside
      I was bathed with some queer smelling substance, fed in small amounts at a
      time, and put to bed in a comfortable clean place, in a row with a number
      of other cats.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      You may imagine how fond I became of my rescuer. It may seem hard to
      believe, but once she actually patted me on the head and stroked my fur
      with her gentle hands. No one had ever done that before. It made me feel
      like crying. Such kindness made life worth living, and, thanks to good
      care, good food, and a contented mind, I was getting better every day. One
      day I heard her say that I was improving and must have once been a
      handsome cat. I wanted to tell her of my wonderful voice, but did not do
      so, and compromised by squaring my shoulders and combing out my whiskers
      with my claws, for I had saved them and felt that they were still a credit
      to me. (I think she admired them also.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing occasional barkings, I soon found that there were dogs of all
      descriptions there also, but in another room where they could not molest
      us. Oh, what a beautiful place it seemed after all my wanderings and
      hardships. Time went on and from remarks I overheard, I knew that I had
      regained my former excellent appearance. People frequently came in and
      looked at us, and occasionally some man or woman would take one of the
      cats or dogs away, never to be seen at the League again.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day a motor car stopped at the door and an attractively dressed woman
      entered and said that she was seeking a good cat to take home. She looked
      carefully at each one of us and my heart almost stopped beating when she
      paused before my cage and said, "I like his looks best of all; may I have
      him?" The kind lady replied, "Well, he is such a dear good thing that I
      hate to part with him, but I want to get him in a good home, so you may
      take him along."
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not like to leave her, but trusted that she knew my welfare best and
      so putting my mute thanks into my eyes I gave her a long last look and was
      hurried into the motor car. I thought of Lord Roberts, but was even more
      delighted when we stopped on the very same avenue where I had followed the
      burglars. To my surprise and pleasure I found that it was the very house
      of my adventure, as I recognized the hall and carpets. Later on I happened
      to look out of one of the dining-room windows and if you will believe me,
      there was Lord Roberts sitting out in the next yard sunning himself. As he
      got up and paced around in a dignified manner I tapped with my paw on the
      glass, but he would not deign to look up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day I was allowed to go out for a walk and since he was in his
      yard, and our adjoining gate was open, I made bold to walk in and attempt
      to renew our acquaintanceship. He proved to be a snob, but did not
      recognize me as his alley friend when in need. Of course I understood that
      it was not my place to call first because he was very haughty and showed
      that he was unwilling to make my acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I wore a collar which was newer and more expensive than his, and
      he knew that my people belonged to the "four hundred," so he finally
      condescended to notice me and asked me a few questions concerning my
      pedigree. I told him that my ancestors came over in the Mayflower, for was
      not Carver a name of which to be proud? He said that he belonged to the
      English aristocracy, but soon discovered that my education was better than
      his, for he had learned his letters only from playing around on the
      nursery floor and seeing them on blocks. His lessons of life had been
      acquired from a Mother Goose book when the children babbled, "Hi diddle,
      diddle, the cat and the fiddle, the cow jumped over the moon," or some
      other such silly jumble of nonsense. He put on a great many airs, but knew
      nothing. I had acquired a little style myself, and finding he knew so
      little, took the upper hand and patronized him shamefully. If he had
      remembered my picking him out a choice bone from a garbage box and his
      dignified refusal, all would have been lost, but he didn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      My looks had undergone a great change, I was sleek and glossy, for one of
      the maids had used some hair brilliantine belonging to the mistress on my
      coat. Accordingly Lord Roberts asked me to call again and I thanked him,
      saying that I should be pleased to do so. We saw each other quite
      frequently after that and became firm friends, for he soon found
      discretion to be the better part of valor, as my time spent in the slums
      had not been in vain in one respect,&mdash;I knew how to fight.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      My owners finally recognized me as the cat who had saved their silver. It
      happened as follows: One night in the winter a nurse was up with one of
      the children, who was ill. She gently soothed it and carrying some damp
      clothing into the sitting-room, placed it before the open fire to dry. She
      returned to the child and I lay down by the fire. I must have slept for
      some time when I was awakened by a suffocating sensation. To my horror I
      saw that the clothes had caught fire and that the wood-work around the
      fireplace was burning also.
    </p>
    <p>
      What should I do? Oh, how my eyes smarted! I had a hard task to find my
      way to the door and was very glad to find it not quite closed. I crept
      through the small opening, rushed to my master's room and stood by his
      side, giving the same cry of warning that I did when the house was
      entered. He jumped up and touching the button exclaimed, "That is the same
      cat who gave the alarm before!" At the same instant he smelled smoke and
      made his way out into the hall where he found the fire. All was confusion
      at first, but as the chemical engine was just around the corner, the
      firemen were soon in the house and had the fire quickly extinguished. One
      of them said that if master had not waked as soon as he did, all would
      have been burned in their beds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps I was not a hero! No one could do enough for me. I had an entire
      chop for breakfast (I thought of Lord Roberts and his liver). I did wish
      that mother and my nephew Tom, who, I had heard, was helping mother keep
      the mice away from the store, could see me now.
    </p>
    <p>
      They called me "Hero," I who had never had a name before! After the fire
      the master and mistress did not want me out of their sight and I heard
      master say, "Emily, don't you think we ought to get another cat for the
      heavy work down stairs, such as killing the rats and mice?" She said,
      "Yes." My heart gave a great bound for I thought of Tom, my nephew, who
      was a fine young cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day I took a walk, unknown to the household. My collar gave me
      prestige and no one dared molest me. I made my way to the old provision
      store and found mother, who was getting quite stout, dozing in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was pleased to hear of my prosperity and thought I looked extremely
      well. I told her about the chance for another cat at our house, and
      suggested Tom, whom I knew she had labored to bring up to be a credit to
      us all. I explained to her how I had the run of the library and could
      direct his education; this made her see what a great advantage it would be
      to him. She said that my brother Teddy had grown fat and lazy and was not
      very valuable to her, thus making it harder to spare Tom, but that she
      would not stand in his way. So Tom went in and spruced up a bit and I took
      him home with me. The cook took a liking to him at once, and that meant a
      good deal for his future welfare. The master and mistress liked his looks
      and were satisfied with my choice, and the cook allowed me to take him
      upstairs, whenever our people were out. Thus I taught him many things, so
      that when I passed away he could take my place in the household.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began to settle down into a calm middle age, happy and contented; my
      working days were over and I felt that I had earned a rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Roberts' people went to the same seashore resort that ours did and,
      to my delight, I was to go also, leaving Tom with the caretaker to protect
      the house from rats and mice in our absence. I enjoyed myself every summer
      by going down to the beach and watching the children in bathing and then
      sunning myself on the piazza. I did not have much to do, but an occasional
      mouse would find to his sorrow that I slept with one eye open. We did not
      remain very late in the fall, but one summer, as Lord Roberts' family
      wished to make a longer season, we stayed also. I had noticed that after
      the houses were closed there were many cats about. Some would come to the
      back door and our cook, who was tender-hearted, would throw food out to
      them. I did not understand this at first but soon found out what it meant.
      Their owners had returned to the city and had left them to look out for
      themselves; the only excuse was that it was too much trouble to carry them
      back or, very possibly they were forgotten in the moving. Oh, what a
      hungry horde we saw them become as we stayed through October! Their gaunt
      bodies and hollow eyes which glowed like coals of fire, would have been a
      reproach to the ones who had left them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our people finally began to pack up and word was given that the next day
      we should all go back to the city. I was pleased for it did seem good to
      think of returning to my beautiful home. Lord Roberts announced that his
      people were going the same day, and was as pleased over it as I was. While
      the things were being put on express teams I went out to say good-by to
      some of my friends, as I had made the acquaintance of a number of cats
      during my stay at the shore. It astonished me to find them in such a
      pitiable condition, and to find that they had given up hopes that their
      people would ever return for them. I could not understand this state of
      things and spent some time trying to console and cheer them. They paced
      wildly up and down, their thin bodies and hungry faces revealing their
      inward sufferings and they now began to realize that cold weather was
      approaching. Their plight was a serious thing to me and the time passed on
      for I hated to leave them to their misery, going back as I was to a
      comfortable home. When at last I hurried back, what was my horror to find
      that the family had gone and that the house was boarded up.
    </p>
    <p>
      I walked around the house several times but no one was there. I became
      frenzied with fear. The wind was North and it was getting colder with the
      approach of night. I thought of Lord Roberts and proceeded to his house
      where I found that not only had his people gone but that he had been left
      locked up in the house.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      I tried to be brave, but when I heard the pitiful cries of Lord Roberts, I
      broke down and almost gave up in despair. This, then, was the end of my
      dreams of a happy life during my old age. Oh, human beings! Could you
      realize how dependent we are upon your kindness, you would never forget us
      in a time like this. I wished that I was a human being possessed of a
      soul, and could pray to God for deliverance from such misery as I had
      witnessed, when suddenly I remembered that I had heard a teacher in one of
      the class-rooms read from the Bible one morning that not even a sparrow
      could fall to the ground and He not heed. It gave me courage for I thought
      if He could care for a sparrow, He would surely protect us from harm. I
      felt better and saying words of encouragement to Lord Roberts, went back
      to the house where I crawled under the piazza and remained there
      throughout the dreary night.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a cruel awakening, no fire and nothing to eat. I dragged myself to
      Lord Roberts and found that he had fared somewhat better, for he had
      discovered a pan of water under the ice-chest, and (he hated to admit it)
      had caught and eaten a mouse (I thought again of his liver for breakfast).
      He said that he knew they would come back for us and I really thought
      myself that they would as soon as they found that we were missing. It had
      not rained for some time and, as I walked down to the beach, I saw some of
      the cats who had been left go down and try to lap up the salt water. It
      seemed to make them more frantic and miserable than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of these cats had been kept alive by eating such things as they could
      find in the refuse left by the summer people. A few rats and mice had
      helped to keep them alive, and one poor creature had been so hungry that
      he had pushed his head into an empty tomato can, and as he could not get
      it out was rushing wildly about, shaking the can with much violence. He
      got to be a horror to us all, but we could not help him and he finally
      smothered to death. Oh, peaceful release from torture! Such maddening
      thirst and not a drop of water to be had. I went around to see how Lord
      Roberts was getting along and found him discouraged and heart broken. He
      said, "It can not be possible that our people have abandoned us, it must
      be some horrible mistake." I went every day to the main road and watched
      for motor cars, which never came. I grew thinner and thinner. There were
      no city streets to get a living from, no milk jars; nothing but a barren
      waste, over which the wind howled like a lost soul, and the cruel sea,
      with its waste of water, but none to drink. What torments we all suffered!
      Yet it was all so needless. How could our people eat, drink, and be merry
      while we were starving? I got so hungry that I became delirious with
      fever. In the long watches of the quiet nights I dreamed of my mother and
      my childhood. Soon in my vision I was wandering without a home, then came
      to my new people and my bountiful home. I awoke with parched mouth, weak
      from hunger and thirst.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning I dragged myself to the front path and feebly lay down in
      despair. When suddenly "What was that I heard?" I started up&mdash;surely
      a dream&mdash;No! a reality!!
    </p>
    <p>
      The welcome sound of a motor car!!! In a few minutes a car came thundering
      up the drive. It was our own&mdash;my own&mdash;and I was saved. They all
      jumped out and lifted me tenderly up and I saw tears in the eyes of my
      mistress. It seemed that they thought I had been lost from the car and had
      given me up until one of the family said, "Perhaps we did not take him on
      at all. Let us go back and see." Business, however, had kept the master so
      tied up that he could not spare the car. After my rescue they tried to
      make me comfortable but I thought of poor Lord Roberts and tried to tell
      them of his plight, and when the car was slowly nearing his house I flung
      myself out and crept to his window and when they followed, his cry of
      despair made them understand, and Lord Roberts was saved!
    </p>
    <p>
      How happy I was when we reached home and how grateful when the mistress
      went to the telephone and called up the kind lady of the Animal Rescue
      League. She told her that there were a dozen or more abandoned cats at the
      shore and giving directions to her begged her to go, or send at once to
      see that, if they could not be saved, they would be put out of their
      misery. A happy, peaceful life with dear Tom for a companion followed from
      then on. Everyone is so kind and considerate to me now in my old age that
      I plead for the others, the less fortunate ones of my species&mdash;and I
      also pray that all who read these simple annals of my life will find it in
      their hearts to remember their faithful feline friends and never under any
      circumstances be tempted to ill-use or abandon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as I sit in the gentle glow of the firelight, the light of my life
      growing dimmer day by day, waiting to join the great majority, I thank the
      God of my master, that I am no longer a nomad, a wanderer, and my heart
      goes out to those who are. Shall ye wilfully abandon His creatures, ye
      shall not enjoy peace in the hereafter!

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
