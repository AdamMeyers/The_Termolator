      THE GOLDEN GLOVE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> wealthy young
      squire of Tam worth, we hear,
    </p>
    <p>
      He courted a noblemans daughter so fair;
    </p>
    <p>
      And for to marry her it was his intent,
    </p>
    <p>
      All friends and relations gave their consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The time was appointed for the wedding-day,
    </p>
    <p>
      A young farmer chosen to give her away;
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the farmer the young lady did spy,
    </p>
    <p>
      He inflamed her heart; "O, my heart!" she
    </p>
    <p>
      did cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned from the squire, but nothing she said,
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of being married she took to her bed;
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought of the farmer soon run in her mind,
    </p>
    <p>
      A way for to have him she quickly did find.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Coat, waistcoat, and breeches she then did put on,
    </p>
    <p>
      And a hunting she went with her dog and her
    </p>
    <p>
      gun;
    </p>
    <p>
      She hunted all round where the farmer did dwell,
    </p>
    <p>
      Because in her heart she did love him full well:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She oftentimes fired, but nothing she killed,
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the young farmer came into the field;
    </p>
    <p>
      And to discourse with him it was her intent,
    </p>
    <p>
      With her dog and her gun to meet him she went.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you had been at the wedding," she cried,
    </p>
    <p>
      "To wait on the squire, and give him his bride."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir," said the farmer, "if the truth I may tell,
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll not give her away, for I love her too well."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose that the lady should grant you her love,
    </p>
    <p>
      You know that the squire your rival will prove.''
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, then," says the farmer, "I'll take sword
    </p>
    <p>
      in hand,
    </p>
    <p>
      By honour I'll gain her when she shall command.''
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It pleased the lady to find him so bold;
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him a glove that was flowered with gold,
    </p>
    <p>
      And told him she found it when coming along,
    </p>
    <p>
      As she was a hunting with her dog and gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady went home with a heart full of love,
    </p>
    <p>
      And gave out a notice that she'd lost a glove;
    </p>
    <p>
      And said, "Who has found it, and brings it to
    </p>
    <p>
      me,
    </p>
    <p>
      Whoever he is, he my husband shall be."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmer was pleased when he heard of the
    </p>
    <p>
      news,
    </p>
    <p>
      With heart full of joy to the lady he goes:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear, honoured lady, I've picked up your glove,
    </p>
    <p>
      And hope you'll be pleased to grant me your love."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's already granted, I will be your bride;
    </p>
    <p>
      I love the sweet breath of a farmer," she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll be mistress of my dairy, and milking my cow,
    </p>
    <p>
      While my jolly brisk farmer is whistling at plough."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And when she was married she told of her fun,
    </p>
    <p>
      How she went a hunting with her dog and gun:
    </p>
    <p>
      "And "[said]" now I've got him so fast in my snare,
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll enjoy him for ever, I vow and declare!"

    </p>
    <p>
      Her parents died and left her five hundred pounds in gold,
    </p>
    <p>
      She lived with her uncle, the cause of all her woe,
    </p>
    <p>
      And you shall hear this maiden fair did prove his overthrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Her uncle had a ploughboy, young Mary loved full well,
    </p>
    <p>
      And in her uncle's garden their tales of love would tell;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a wealthy squire who oft came her to see,
    </p>
    <p>
      But still she loved her ploughboy, on the bank of sweet Dundee.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on one summer's morning, her uncle went straightway,
    </p>
    <p>
      He knocked at her chamber door, and unto her did say,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, rise up, pretty maiden, a lady you may be,
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire is waiting for you on the banks of sweet Dundee."

    <p>
      "A fig for all your squires, your lords and dukes likewise,
    </p>
    <p>
      For William's hand appears to me like diamonds in my eyes;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Begone, unruly maiden, you ne'er shall happy be,
    </p>
    <p>
      For I mean to banish William from the banks of sweet Dundee."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Her uncle and the squire rode out one summer day,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young William he's in favour," her uncle he did say,
    </p>
    <p>
      "But indeed it's my intention to tie him to a tree,
    </p>
    <p>
      Or else to bribe the pressgang, on the banks of sweet Dundee."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The pressgang came to William when he was all alone,
    </p>
    <p>
      He bravely fought for liberty, but they were six to one,
    </p>
    <p>
      The blood did flow, in torrents: "Pray kill me now," said he,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd rather die for Mary I, on the banks of sweet Dundee."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      This maid one day was walking, lamenting for her love,
    </p>
    <p>
      She met the wealthy squire down in her uncles grove,
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his arm around her: "Stand off, base man," said she,
    </p>
    <p>
      "For you've sent the only lad I love, from the banks of sweet Dundee."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He clasped his arms around her, and tried to throw her down,
    </p>
    <p>
      Two pistols and a sword she spied beneath his morning gown,
    </p>
    <p>
      The pistol proved so active, the sword she used so free,
    </p>
    <p>
      That she shot and slew the squire, on the banks of sweet Dundee.

    <p class="indent5">
      I'll wait till I bin fifty;

    <p>
      So I think I'll tak ye at your word,

      And make a wife sae thrifty."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Robbie was an angry man,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      For a t' loss of his daughter,
    </p>
    <p>
      Through all the town baith up and down,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And far and near he sought her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he cam to our gude inn
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And found us baith together,
    </p>
    <p>
      Says I, "My lad, I've tick your bairn,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Tho' ye may tak my mither."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Robbie girned and shook his head:
    </p>
    <p>
      Quo' he, "I think I'll marry;
    </p>
    <p>
      And so I'll tak ye at your word,
    </p>
    <p>
      To end the hurry burry."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Robbie and our ain gudewife
    </p>
    <p>
      . Agreed to creep together:
    </p>
    <p>
      So I've ta'en Robbie Tamson's pet,
    </p>
    <p>
      And Robbie's ta'en my mither.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>n ancient story
      I'll tell you anon
    </p>
    <p>
      Of a notable prince, that was called King John;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he ruled England with main and with
    </p>
    <p>
      might,
    </p>
    <p>
      For he did great wrong, and maintain'd little right.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And I'll tell you a story, a story so merry,
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning the Abbot of Canterbury;
    </p>
    <p>
      How for his house-keeping and high renown,
    </p>
    <p>
      They rode post for him to fair London town.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      An hundred men, the king did hear say,
    </p>
    <p>
      The abbot kept in his house every day;
    </p>
    <p>
      And fifty gold chains, without any doubt,
    </p>
    <p>
      In velvet coats waited the abbot about.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "How now, father abbot, I hear it of thee,
    </p>
    <p>
      Thou keepest a far better house than me;
    </p>
    <p>
      And for thy house-keeping and high renown,
    </p>
    <p>
      I fear thou workst treason against my crown."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "My liege," quo' the abbot, "I would it were known
    </p>
    <p>
      I never spend nothing, but what is my own;
    </p>
    <p>
      And I trust your grace will do me no deere,
    </p>
    <p>
      For spending of my own true-gotten gear."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes, father abbot, thy fault it is high,
    </p>
    <p>
      And now for the same thou needest must die;
    </p>
    <p>
      For except thou canst answer me questions three,
    </p>
    <p>
      Thy head shall be smitten from thy body.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "And first," quo' the king, "when I'm in this

    <p>
      stead,
    </p>
    <p>
      With my crown of gold so fair on my head,
    </p>
    <p>
      Among all my liege-men so noble of birth,
    </p>
    <p>
      Thou must tell me to one penny what I am worth.

    <p>
      And at the third question thou must not shrink,
    </p>
    <p>
      But tell me here truly what I do think."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "O these are hard questions for my shallow wit,
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor I cannot answer your grace as yet:
    </p>
    <p>
      But if you will give me but three weeks' space,
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll do my endeavour to answer your grace."
    </p>

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now three weeks' space to thee will I give,
    </p>
    <p>
      And that is the longest time thou hast to live;
    </p>
    <p>
      For if thou dost not answer my questions three,
    </p>
    <p>
      Thy lands and thy livings are forfeit to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Away rode the abbot all sad at that word,
    </p>
    <p>
      And he rode to Cambridge, and Oxenford;
    </p>
    <p>
      But never a doctor there was so wise,
    </p>
    <p>
      That could with his learning an answer devise.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then home rode the abbot of comfort so cold,
    </p>
    <p>
      And he met his shepherd a going to fold:

    <p>
      "How now, my lord abbot, you are welcome home;

    <p>
      What news do you bring us from good King John?"

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sad news, sad news, shepherd, I must give,
    </p>
    <p>
      That I have but three days more to live;
    </p>
    <p>
      For if I do not answer him questions three
    </p>
    <p>
      My head will be smitten from my body.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "The first is to tell him there in that stead,
    </p>
    <p>
      With his crown of gold so fair on his head,
    </p>
    <p>
      Among all his liege-men so noble of birth,
    </p>
    <p>
      To within one penny of what he is worth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "The second, to tell him, without any doubt,

    <p>
      How soon he may ride this whole world about;

    <p>

      That a fool he may learn a wise man wit?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lend me horse, and serving men, and your apparel,

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, welcome, sire abbot," the king he did say,

    <p>
      "'Tis well thourt come back to keep thy day:
    </p>
    <p>
      For and if thou canst answer my questions three,

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>ear to Clapham
      town-gate lived an old Yorkshire tike,
    </p>
    <p>
      Who in dealing in horseflesh had ne'er met his like;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twas his pride that in all the hard bargains he'd hit,
    </p>
    <p>
      He'd bit a great many, but never been bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>town-gate</i>, high road.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      This old Tommy Tavers (by that name he was known),
    </p>
    <p>
      Had an old carrion bit that was sheer skin and bone;
    </p>
    <p>
      To have killed him for the curs would have been quite as well,
    </p>
    <p>
      But 'twas Tommy's opinion he'd die of himsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Well! one Abey Muggins, a neighbouring cheat,
    </p>
    <p>
      Thought to diddle old Tommy would be a great treat;
    </p>
    <p>
      He'd a horse, too, 'twas worse than old Tommy's, you see,
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortnight afore that he'd thought proper to dee!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinks Abey, th' old codger'll never smoke t' trick,
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll swop with him my poor dead horse for his quick,
    </p>
    <p>
      And if Tommy I nobbut can happen to trap,
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twill be a fine feather in Aberram cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So to Tommy he goes and to Tommy he pops:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Between my horse and thine, prithee, Tommy, what swops?
    </p>
    <p>
      What will give me to boot? for mines t' better horse still!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nought," says Tommy, "I'll swop even hands, an ye will."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>nobbut,</i> only.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbey preached a long time about something to boot,
    </p>
    <p>
      Insisting that his was the liveliest brute;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Tommy stuck fast where he first had begun,
    </p>
    <p>
      Till Abey shook hands, and said, "Well Tommy, done."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "O! Tommy," said Abey, "I'se sorry for thee,
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought thou'd a hadden more white in thy ee;
    </p>
    <p>
      Good luck's in thy bargain, for my horse is
    </p>
    <p>
      dead"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hey," says Tommy, "my lad, so is mine, an it's flayed."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So Tommy got t' better of t' bargain, a vast,
    </p>
    <p>
      And came off with a Yorkshireman's triumph at last;
    </p>
    <p>
      For though 'twixt dead horses there's not much to choose
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Tommy was richer by the hide and four shoes.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
