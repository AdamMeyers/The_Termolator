NOTE


For the privilege of reprinting the rimes gathered
here I am indebted to the courtesy of
the Chicago Tribune and Puck, in whose pages
most of them first appeared.        The Lay of St.
Ambrose        is new.

One reason for rounding up this fugitive
verse and prisoning it between covers was this:
Frequently       more or less       I receive a request
for a copy of this jingle or that, and it is easier
to mention a publishing house than to search
through ancient and dusty files.

The other reason was that I wanted to.

B. L. T.




[Pg 7]
TO MY READERS


Not merely of this book,       but a larger company,
with whom, through the medium of the Chicago
Tribune, I have been on very pleasant terms for
several years,       this handful of rime is joyously
dedicated.




[Pg 9]

THE LAY OF ST. AMBROSE


       And hard by doth dwell, in St. Catherine       s cell,
 Ambrose, the anchorite old and grey.       
        The Lay of St. Nicholas.




 Ambrose the anchorite old and grey
   Larruped himself in his lonely cell,
 And many a welt on his pious pelt
   The scourge evoked as it rose and fell.


 For hours together the flagellant leather
   Went whacketty-whack with his groans of pain;
 And the lay-brothers said, with a wag of the head,
         Ambrose has been at the bottle again.       


 And such, in sooth, was the sober truth;
   For the single fault of this saintly soul
 Was a desert thirst for the cup accurst,       
   A quenchless love for the Flowing Bowl.


 When he woke at morn with a head forlorn
   And a taste like a last-year swallow       s nest,
 He would kneel and pray, then rise and flay
   His sinful body like all possessed.


 Frequently tempted, he fell from grace,
   And as often he found the devil to pay;
 But by diligent scourging and diligent purging
   He managed to keep Old Nick at bay.

[Pg 10]
 This was the plight of our anchorite,       
   An endless penance condemned to dree,       
 When it chanced one day there came his way
   A Mystical Book with a golden Key.


 This Mystical Book was a guide to health,
   That none might follow and go astray;
 While a turn of the Key unlocked the wealth
   That all unknown in the Scriptures lay.


 Disease is sin, the Book defined;
   Sickness is error to which men cling;
 Pain is merely a state of mind,
   And matter a non-existent thing.


 If a tooth should ache, or a leg should break,
   You simply        affirm        and it       s sound again.
 Cut and contusion are only delusion,
   And indigestion a fancied pain.


 For pain is naught if you        hold a thought,       
   Fevers fly at your simple say;
 You have but to affirm, and every germ
   Will fold up its tent and steal away.




 From matin gong to even-song
   Ambrose pondered this mystic lore,
 Till what had seemed fiction took on a conviction
   That words had never possessed before.

[Pg 11]
       If pain,        quoth he,        is a state of mind,
   If a rough hair shirt to silk is kin,       
 If these things are error, pray where       s the terror
   In scourging and purging oneself of sin?


       It certainly seemeth good to me,
   By and large, in part and in whole.
 I       ll put it in practice and find if it fact is,
   Or only a mystical rigmarole.       




 The very next night our anchorite
   Of the Flowing Bowl drank long and deep.
 He argued this wise:        New Thought applies
   No fitter to lamb than it does to sheep.       


 When he woke at morn with a head forlorn
   And a taste akin to a parrot       s cage,
 He knelt and prayed, then up and flayed
   His sinful flesh in a righteous rage.


 Whacketty-whack on breast and back,
   Whacketty-whack, before, behind;
 But he held the thought as he laid it on,
         Pain is merely a state of mind.       


 Whacketty-whack on breast and back,
   Whacketty-whack on calf and shin;
 And the lay-brothers said, with a wag of the head,
         Ain       t he the glutton for discipline!       



[Pg 12]
 Now every night our anchorite
   Was exceedingly tight when he went to bed.
 The scourge that once pained him no longer restrained him,
   Nor even the fear of an aching head.


 For he woke at morn with a pate as clear
   As the silvery chime of the matin bell;
 And without any jogging he fell to his flogging,
   And larruped himself in his lonely cell.


 But the leather had lost its power to sting;
   To pangs of the flesh he was now immune;
 His rough hair shirt no longer hurt,
   Nor the pebbles he wore in his wooden shoon.


 When conscience was troubled he cheerfully doubled
   His matinal dose of discipline;       
 A deuce of a scourging, sufficient for purging
   The Devil himself of original sin.


 Whacketty-whack on breast and back,
   Whacketty-whack from morn to noon;
 Whacketty-whacketty-whacketty-whack!       
   Till the abbey rang with the dismal tune.


 Deacon and prior, lay-brother and friar
   Exclaimed at these whoppings spectacular;
 And even the Abbot remarked that the habit
   Of scourging oneself might be carried too far.

[Pg 13]
       My son,        said he,        I am pleased to see
   Such penance as never was known before;
 But you raise such a racket in dusting your jacket,
   The noise is becoming a bit of a bore.


       How would it do if you whaled yourself
   From eight to ten or from one to three?
 Or if        More        is your motto, pray hire a grotto;
   I know of one you can have rent free.       




 Ambrose the anchorite bowed his head,
   And girded his loins and went away.
 He rented a cavern not far from a tavern,
   And tippled by night and scourged by day.


 The more the penance the more the sin,
   The more he whopped him the more he drank;
 Till his hair fell out and his cheeks fell in,
   And his corpulent figure grew long and lank.


 At Whitsuntide he up and died,
   While flaying himself for his final spree.
 And who shall say whether        twas liquor or leather
   That hurried him into eternity?


 They made him a saint, as well they might,
   And gave him a beautiful aureole.
 And       somehow or other, this circle of light
   Suggests the rim of the Flowing Bowl.




[Pg 14]
TO A TALL SPRUCE



 Pride of the forest primeval,
 Peer of the glorious pine,
 Doomed to an end that is evil,
 Fearful the fate that is thine!


 Peer of the glorious pine,
 Now the landlooker has found you,
 Fearful the fate that is thine       
 Fate of the spruces around you.


 Now the landlooker has found you,
 Stripped of your beautiful plume       
 Fate of the spruces around you       
 Swiftly you       ll draw to your doom.


 Stripped of your beautiful plume,
 Bzzng! into logs they will whip you.
 Swiftly you       ll draw to your doom;
 To the pulp mill they will ship you.


 Bzzng! into logs they will whip you,
 Lumbermen greedy for gold.
 To the pulp mill they will ship you.
 Hearken, there       s worse to be told!


 Lumbermen greedy for gold
 Over your ruins will caper.
 Hearken, there       s worse to be told:
 You will be made into paper!

[Pg 15]
 Over your ruins will caper
 Murderous shavers and hooks.
 You will be made into paper!
 You will be made into books!


 Murderous shavers and hooks
 Swiftly your pride will diminish.
 You will be made into books!
 Horrible, horrible finish!


 Swiftly your pride will diminish.
 You will become a romance!
 Horrible, horrible finish!
 Fate has no sadder mischance.


 You will become a romance,
 Filled with        Gadzooks!        and        Have at you!       
 Fate has no sadder mischance;
 It would wring tears from a statue.


 Filled with        Gadzooks!        and        Have at you!       
 You may become a        Lazarre              
 (It would wring tears from a statue)       
       Graustark,               Stovepipe of Navarre.       


 You may become a        Lazarre       ;
 Fate has still worse it can turn on       
       Graustark,               Stovepipe of Navarre,       
 Even a        Dorothy Vernon       !


 Fate has still worse it can turn on       
 Lower you cannot descend;
 Even a        Dorothy Vernon       !       
 That is the limit       the end.

[Pg 16]
 Lower you cannot descend.
 Doomed to an end that is evil,
 That is the limit       the end!
 Pride of the forest primeval.




[Pg 17]
IN THE LAMPLIGHT



 The dinner done, the lamp is lit,
 And in its mellow glow we sit
 And talk of matters, grave and gay,
 That went to make another day.
 Comes Little One, a book in hand,
 With this request, nay, this command       
 (For who       d gainsay the little sprite)       
       Please       will you read to me to-night?       


 Read to you, Little One? Why, yes.
 What shall it be to-night? You guess
 You       d like to hear about the Bears       
 Their bowls of porridge, beds and chairs?
 Well, that you shall.... There! that tale       s done!
 And now       you       d like another one?
 To-morrow evening, Curly Head.
 It       s        hass-pass seven.        Off to bed!


 So each night another story:
 Wicked dwarfs and giants gory;
 Dragons fierce and princes daring,
 Forth to fame and fortune faring;
 Wandering tots, with leaves for bed;
 Houses made of gingerbread;
 Witches bad and fairies good,
 And all the wonders of the wood.


       I like the witches best,        says she
 Who nightly nestles on my knee;
[Pg 18]
 And why by them she sets such store,
 Psychologists may puzzle o       er.
 Her likes are mine, and I agree
 With all that she confides to me.
 And thus we travel, hand in hand,
 The storied roads of Fairyland.


 Ah, Little One, when years have fled,
 And left their silver on my head,
 And when the dimming eyes of age
 With difficulty scan the page,
 Perhaps I       ll turn the tables then;
 Perhaps I       ll put the question, when
 I borrow of your better sight       
       Please       will you read to me to-night?       




[Pg 19]
THE BREAKFAST FOOD FAMILY



 John Spratt will eat no fat,
   Nor will he touch the lean;
 He scorns to eat of any meat,
   He lives upon Foodine.


 But Mrs. Spratt will none of that,
   Foodine she cannot eat;
 Her special wish is for a dish
   Of Expurgated Wheat.


 To William Spratt that food is flat
   On which his mater dotes.
 His favorite feed       his special need       
   Is Eata Heapa Oats.


 But sister Lil can       t see how Will
   Can touch such tasteless food.
 As breakfast fare it can       t compare,
   She says, with Shredded Wood.


 Now, none of these Leander please,
   He feeds upon Bath Mitts.
 While sister Jane improves her brain
  With Cero-Grapo-Grits.


 Lycurgus votes for Father       s Oats;
   Proggine appeals to May;
 The junior John subsists upon
  Uneeda Bayla Hay.

[Pg 20]
 Corrected Wheat for little Pete;
   Flaked Pine for Dot; while        Bub       
 The infant Spratt is waxing fat
   On Battle Creek Near-Grub.




[Pg 21]
       TREASURE ISLAND       



 Comes little lady, a book in hand,
 A light in her eyes that I understand,
 And her cheeks aglow from the faery breeze
 That sweeps across the uncharted seas.
 She gives me the book, and her word of praise
 A ton of critical thought outweighs.
       I       ve finished it, daddie!              a sigh thereat.
       Are there any more books in the world like that?       


 No, little lady. I grieve to say
 That of all the books in the world to-day
 There       s not another that       s quite the same
 As this magic book with the magic name.
 Volumes there be that are pure delight,
 Ancient and yellowed or new and bright;
 But       little and thin, or big and fat       
 There are no more books in the world like that.


 And what, little lady, would I not give
 For the wonderful world in which you live!
 What have I garnered one-half as true
 As the tales Titania whispers you?
 Ah, late we learn that the only truth
 Was that which we found in the Book of Youth.
 Profitless others, and stale, and flat;       
 There are no more books in the world like that.




[Pg 22]
A BALLADE OF SPRING       S UNREST



 Up in the woodland where Spring
 Comes as a laggard, the breeze
 Whispers the pines that the King,
 Fallen, has yielded the keys
 To his White Palace and flees
 Northward o       er mountain and dale.
 Speed then the hour that frees!
 Ho, for the pack and the trail!


 Northward my fancy takes wing,
 Restless am I, ill at ease.
 Pleasures the city can bring
 Lose now their power to please.
 Barren, all barren, are these,
 Town life       s a tedious tale;
 That cup is drained to the lees       
 Ho, for the pack and the trail!


 Ho, for the morning I sling
 Pack at my back, and with knees
 Brushing a thoroughfare, fling
 Into the green mysteries:
 One with the birds and the bees,
 One with the squirrel and quail,
 Night, and the stream       s melodies       
 Ho, for the pack and the trail!

      
[Pg 23]
       L       Envoi


 Pictures and music and teas,
 Theaters       books even       stale.
 Ho, for the smell of the trees!
 Ho, for the pack and the trail!





[Pg 24]
WHY?



 Why, when the sun is gold,
  The weather fine,
 The air (this phrase is old)
   Like Gascon wine;       


 Why, when the leaves are red,
   And yellow, too,
 And when (as has been said)
   The skies are blue;       


 Why, when all things promote
   One       s peace and joy,       
 A joy that is (to quote)
   Without alloy;       


 Why, when a man       s well off,
   Happy and gay,
Why must he go play golf
   And spoil his day!





[Pg 25]
THE RIME OF THE CLARK STREET CABLE

(Now happily extinct.)



 Twas in a vault beneath the street,
   In the trench of the traction rope,
 That I found a guy with a fishy eye
   And a think tank filled with dope.


 His hair was matted, his face was black,
   And matted and black was he;
 And I heard this wight in the vault recite,
         In a singular minor key       :


       Oh, I am the guy with the fishy eye
   And the think tank filled with dope.
 My work is to watch the beautiful botch
   That       s known as the Clark Street Rope.


       I pipes my eye as the rope goes by
   For every danger spot.
 If I spies one out I gives a shout,
   And we puts in another knot.


       Them knots is all like brothers to me,
   And I loves        em, one and all.       
 The muddy guy with the fishy eye
   A muddy tear let fall.


       There goes a knot we tied last week,
   There       s one what we tied to-day;
 And there       s a patch was hard to reach,
   And caused six hours        delay.

[Pg 26]
       Two hundred seventy-nine, all told,
   And I knows their history;
 And I       m most attached to a break we patched
   In the winter of        eighty-three.


       For every time that knot comes round
   It sings out,        Howdy, Bill!
 We       ll walk        em home to-night, old man,
   From here to the Ferris Wheel.


              We       ll walk        em in the rush hours, Bill,
   A swearing company,
 As we       ve walked        em, Bill, since I was tied,
   In the winter of        eighty-three.              


 The muddy guy with the fishy eye
   Let fall another tear.
       Them knots is wife and child to me;
   I       ve known        em forty year.


       For I am the guy with the fishy eye
   And the think tank filled with dope,
 Whose work is to watch the lovely botch
   That       s known as the Clark Street Rope.       





[Pg 27]
MISS LEGION



 She is hotfoot after Cultyure,
 She pursues it with a club.
 She breathes a heavy atmosphere
 Of literary flub.
 No literary shrine so far
 But she is there to kneel;
         But       
 Her favorite line of reading
 Is O. Meredith       s        Lucille.       


 Of course she       s up on pictures       
 Passes for a connoisseur.
 On free days at the Institute
 You       ll always notice her.
 She qualifies approval
 Of a Titian or Corot;
         But       
 She throws a fit of rapture
 When she comes to Bouguereau.


 And when you talk of music,
 She is Music       s devotee.
 She will tell you that Beethoven
 Always makes her wish to pray;
 And        dear old Bach!        His very name
 She says, her ear enchants;
         But       
 Her favorite piece is Weber       s
       Invitation to the Dance.       





[Pg 28]
A BALLADE OF DEATH AND TIME



 I hold it truth with him who sweetly sings       
 The weekly music of the London Sphere       
 That deathless tomes the living present brings:
 Great literature is with us year on year.
 Books of the mighty dead, whom men revere,
 Remind me I can make my books sublime.
 But prithee, bay my brow while I am here:
 Why do we always wait for Death and Time?


 Shakespeare, great spirit, beat his mighty wings,
 As I beat mine, for the occasion near.
 He knew, as I, the worth of present things:
 Great literature is with us year on year.
 Methinks I meet across the gulf his clear
 And tranquil eye; his calm reflections chime
 With mine:        Why do we at the present fleer?
 Why do we always wait for Death and Time?       


 The reading world with acclamation rings
 For my last book. It led the list at Weir,
 Altoona, Rahway, Painted Post, Hot Springs:
 Great literature is with us year on year.
 The Bookman gives me a vociferous cheer.
 Howells approves! I can no higher climb.
 Bring then the laurel, crown my bright career.
 Why do we always wait for Death and Time?

      
[Pg 29]
       L       Envoi


 Critics, who pastward, ever pastward peer,
 Great literature is with us year on year.
 Trumpet my fame while I am in my prime.
 Why do we always wait for Death and Time?





[Pg 30]
THE KAISER       S FAREWELL TO PRINCE HENRY



 Aufwiedersehen, brother mine!
   Farewells will soon be kissed;
 And ere you leave to breast the brine
   Give me once more your fist;


 That mail        d fist, clenched high in air
   On many a foreign shore,
 Enforcing coaling stations where
   No stations were before;


 That fist, which weaker nations view
   As if        twere Michael       s own,
 And which appals the heathen who
   Bow down to wood and stone.


 But this trip no brass knuckles. Glove
   That heavy mail        d hand;
 Your mission now is one of Love
   And Peace       you understand.


 All that       s American you       ll praise;
   The Yank can do no wrong.
 To use his own expressive phrase,
   Just        jolly him along.       


 Express surprise to find, the more
   Of Roosevelt you see,
 How much I am like Theodore,
   And Theodore like me.

[Pg 31]
 I am, in fact, (this might not be
   A bad thing to suggest,)
 The Theodore of the East, and he
   The William of the West.


 And, should you get a chance, find out       
   If anybody knows       
 Exactly what it       s all about,
   That Doctrine of Monroe       s.


 That       s entre nous. My present plan
   You know as well as I:
 Be just as Yankee as you can;
   If needs be, eat some pie.


 Cut out the        kraut, cut out Rhine wine,
   Cut out the Sch      tzenfest,
 The S      ngerbund, the Turnverein,
   The Kommers, and the rest.


 And if some fool society
          Die Wacht am Rhein        should sing,
You sing        My Country,        Tis of Thee              
   The tune       s        God Save the King.       


 To our own kindred in that land
   There       s not much you need tell.
 Just tell them that you saw me, and
   That I was looking well.





[Pg 32]
TO LILLIAN RUSSELL

(A reminiscence of 18       .)



 Dear Lillian! (The        dear        one risks;
       Miss Russell        were a bit austerer)       
 Do you remember Mr. Fiske       s
    Dramatic Mirror


 Back when       ? (But we       ll not count the years;
 The way they       ve sped is most surprising.)
 You were a trifle in arrears
     For advertising.


 I brought the bill to your address;
 I was the Mirror       s bill collector       
 In Thespian haunts a more or less
     Familiar spectre.


 On that (to me) momentous day
 You dwelt amid the city       s clatter,
 A few doors west of old Broadway;
     The street       no matter.


 But while you have forgot the debt,
 And him who called in line of duty,
 He never, never shall forget
     Your wondrous beauty.


 You were too fair for mortal speech,       
 Enchanting, positively rippin       ;
 You were some dream, and quelque peach,
     And beaucoup pippin.

[Pg 33]
 Your        fight with Time        had not begun,
 Nor any reason to promote it;
 No beauty battles to be won.
     Beauty? You wrote it!


       A bill?        you murmured in distress,
       A bill?        (I still can hear you say it.)
       A bill from Mr. Fiske? Oh, yes ...
     I       ll call and pay it.       


 And he, the thrice-requited kid,
 That such a goddess should address him,
 Could only blush and paw his lid,
     And stammer,        Yes       m!       


 Eheu! It seems a cycle since,
 But still the nerve of memory tingles.
 And here you       re writing Beauty Hints,
     And I these jingles.

DORNR      SCHEN



 In the great hall of Castle Innocence,
 Hedged round with thorns of maiden doubts and fears,       
 Within, without, a silence grave, intense,       
 Her soul lies sleeping through the rose-leaf years.


 Hedged round with thorns of maiden doubts and fears;
 And all save one the thither path shall miss.
 Her soul lies sleeping through the rose-leaf years,
 Waiting the Prince and his awakening kiss.


 And all save one the thither path shall miss;
 For one alone may thread the thorn defence.
 Waiting the Prince and his awakening kiss,
 A hush broods over Castle Innocence.


 For one alone may thread the thorn defence,
 Care free, heart free, and singing on his way.
 A hush broods over Castle Innocence
 One comes to wake;       but when       ah, who can say!


 Care free, heart free, and singing on his way,
 One comes all thorns of Fear and Doubt to dare.
 One comes to wake! But when? Ah, who can say
 The hour his light feet press the castle stair?

[Pg 35]
 One comes all thorns of Fear and Doubt to dare!
 Thorns with his coming into roses bloom.
 The hour his light feet press the castle stair
 The warders of the castle hall give room.


 Thorns with his coming into roses bloom;
 For him the flowers of Trust and Faith unfold.
 The warders of the castle hall give room
 Before the young Prince of the Heart of Gold.


 For him the flowers of Trust and Faith unfold;
 Till then the thorns of maiden doubts and fears.
 Before the young Prince of the Heart of Gold
 Her rose-soul slumbers through the tranquil years.


 Till then the thorns of maiden doubts and fears.
 Within, without, a silence grave, intense.
 Her rose-soul slumbers through the tranquil years
 In the great hall of Castle Innocence.





[Pg 36]
       FAREWELL!       

(Evoked by Calverley       s        Forever.       )



       Farewell!        Another gloomy word
 As ever into language crept.
       Tis often written, never heard
      Except


 In playhouse. Ere the hero flits
 (In handcuffs) from our pitying view,
       Farewell!        he murmurs, then exits
      R. U.


       Farewell!        is much too sighful for
 An age that has not time to sigh.
 We say,        I       ll see you later,        or
            Good-bye!       


       Fare well        meant long ago, before
 It crept tear-spattered into song,
       Safe voyage!               Pleasant journey!        or
            So long!       


 But gone its cheery, old-time ring:
 The poets made it rime with knell.
 Joined, it became a dismal thing       
            Farewell!       


       Farewell!        Into the lover       s soul
 You see fate plunge the cruel iron.
 All poets use it. It       s the whole
      Of Byron.

[Pg 37]
       I only feel       farewell!        said he;
 And always tearful was the telling.
 Lord Byron was eternally
      Farewelling.


       Farewell!        A dismal word,        tis true.
 (And why not tell the truth about it?)
 But what on earth would poets do
      Without it!





[Pg 38]
REFORM IN OUR TOWN



 There was a man in Our Town
   And Jimson was his name,
 Who cried,        Our civic government
   Is honeycombed with shame.       
 He called us neighbors in and said,
         By Graft we       re overrun.
 Let       s have a general cleaning up,
   As other towns have done.       


 The citizens of Our Town
   Responded to the call;
 Beneath the banner of Reform
   We gathered one and all.
 We sent away for men expert
   In hunting civic sin,
 To ask these practised gentlemen
   Just how we should begin.


 The experts came to Our Town
   And told us how        twas done.
       Begin with Gas and Traction,
   And half your fight is won.
 Begin with Gas and Traction;
   The rest will follow soon.       
 We looked at one another
   And hummed a different tune.

[Pg 39]
 Said Smith,        Saloons in Our Town
   Are palaces of shame.       
 Said Jones,        Police corruption
   Has hurt the town       s fair name.       
 Said Brown,        Our lawless children
   Pitch pennies as they please.       
 Now would it not be wiser
   To start Reform with these?


 The men who came to Our Town
   Replied,        No haste with these;
 Begin with Gas       or Water       
   The roots of the disease.       
 We looked at one another
   And hemmed and hawed a bit;
 Enthusiasm faded then
   From every single cit.


 The men who came to Our Town
   Expressed a mild surprise,
 Then they too at each other
   Looked        with a wild surmise.       
 Jimson had stock in Traction,
   And Jones had stock in Gas,
 And Smith and Brown in this and that,
   So       nothing came to pass.

[Pg 40]
 The profligates of Our Town
   Pitch pennies as of yore;
 Police corruption flourishes
   As rankly as before,
 Still are our gilded ginmills
   Foul palaces of shame.
 Reform is just as distant
   As when the wise men came.





[Pg 41]
WHEN THE SIRUP       S ON THE FLAPJACK



 When the sirup       s on the flapjack and the coffee       s in the pot;
 When the fly is in the butter       where he       d rather be than not;
 When the cloth is on the table, and the plates are on the cloth;
 When the salt is in the shaker and the chicken       s in the broth;
 When the cream is in the pitcher and the pitcher       s on the tray,
 And the tray is on the sideboard when it isn       t on the way;
 When the rind is on the bacon and likewise upon the cheese,
 Then I somehow feel inspired to do a string of rimes like these.




[Pg 42]
BREAD PUDDYNGE



 When good King Arthur ruled our land
   He was a goodly king,
 And his idea of what to eat
   Was a good bag puddynge.


 The bag puddynge he had in mind
   Was thickly strewn with plums,
 With alternating lumps of fat
   As big as my two thumbs.


       My love,        quoth he to Guinevere,
         We have a joust to-day       
 Sir Launce is here, Sir Tris, Sir Gal,
   And all the brave array.


       Put everything across to-night
   In guise of goodly fare,
 And cook us up a bag puddynge
   That will y-curl our hair.       


       I       ll curl your hair,        said Guinevere,
         As tight as tight can be;
 I       ll cook you up a bag puddynge
   From my new recipee.       




       Pitch in and eat, my merry men!       
   That night the King did say;
       But save a little room       a bag
   Puddynge is on the way.

[Pg 43]
       Ho! here it comes! Now, by my sword,
   A famous feast        twill be.
 Queen Guinevere hath cooked it, Launce,
   From her own recipee.       


       Odslife!        cried Launce,        if there is aught
   I love        tis this same thing.       
 And he and all the knights did fall
   Upon that bag puddynge.


 One taste, and every holy knight
   Sat speechless for a space,
 While disappointment and disgust
   Were writ in every face.


       Odsbodikins!        Sir Tristram cried,
         In all my days, by Jing!
 I ne       er did taste so flat a mess
   As this here bag puddynge.       


       Odswhiskers, Arthur!        cried Sir Launce,
   Whose license knew no bounds,
       I would to Godde I had this stuff
   To poultice up my wounds.       


 King Arthur spat his mouthful out,
   And sent for Guinevere.
       What is this frightful mess?        he roared.
         Is this a joke, my dear?       

[Pg 44]
       Oh, ain       t it good?        asked Guinevere,
   Her face a rosy red.
       I thought        twould make an awful hit:
  I made it out of bread!       




 When good King Arthur ruled our land
   He was a goodly king,
 And only once in all his reign
   Was made a Bread Puddynge.





[Pg 45]
MUSCA DOMESTICA



 Baby bye, here       s a fly,
 We will watch him, you and I;
 Lest he fall in Baby       s mouth,
 Bringing germs from north and south.
 In the world of things a-wing
 There is not a nastier thing
 Than this pesky little fly;       
 So we       ll watch him, you and I.


 See him crawl up the wall,
 And he       ll never, never fall;
 Save that, poisoned, he may drop
 In the soup or on the chop.
 Let us coax the cunning brute
 To the tempting Tanglefoot,
 Or invite his thirsty soul
 To the poison-paper bowl.


 I believe with six such legs
 You or I could walk on eggs;
 But he       d rather crawl on meat
 With his microbe-laden feet.
 Eggs would hardly do as well       
 He could not get through the shell;
 Better far, to spread disease,
 Vegetables, meat, or cheese.

[Pg 46]
 There he goes, on his toes,
 Tickling, tickling Baby       s nose.
 Heaven knows where he has been,
 And what filth he       s wallowed in.
 Drat the nasty little wretch!
 He       s the deuce and all to ketch.
 Ah! He       s settled on the wall.
 Now the thunderbolt shall fall!


 Baby bye, see that fly?
 We will swat him, you and I.





[Pg 47]
THE PASSIONATE PROFESSOR


       But bending low, I whisper only this:
        Love, it is night.              
       Harry Thurston Peck.



 Love, it is night. The orb of day
 Has gone to hit the cosmic hay.
   Nocturnal voices now we hear.
   Come, heart       s delight, the hour is near
 When Passion       s mandate we obey.


 I would not, sweet, the fact convey
 In any crude and obvious way:
   I merely whisper in your ear       
                         Love, it is night!       


 Candor compels me, pet, to say
 That years my fading charms betray.
   Tho        Love be blind, I grant it       s clear
   I       m no Apollo Belvedere.
 But after dark all cats are gray.
                   Love, it is night!





[Pg 48]
A BALLADE OF WOOL-GATHERING



 Now is my season of unrest,
 Now calls the forest, day and night;
 And by its pleasant spell obsessed,
 My wits go soaring like a kite.
 Forgive me if I be not bright,
 And pardon if I seem distrait;
 Wood-fancies put my wits to flight;       
 The woods are but a week away.


 Palleth upon my soul the jest,
 Falleth upon my pen a blight.
 The daily task has lost its zest,
 And everything is flat and trite.
 There       s nothing humorous in sight;
 Don       t mind if I am dull to-day.
 For every column is a fight
 When woods are but a week away.


 Woods in the robes of summer dressed       
 In greens and grays and browns bedight!
 A journey on a river       s breast,
 Beneath the wedded blue-and-white!...
 This end the Voyage of Delight
 Waits, in a little wood-bound bay,
 A bark canoe, all trim and tight;       
 The woods are but a week away!

      
[Pg 49]
       L       Envoi


 Dear Reader, there is much to write;
 I       ve many weighty things to say.
 But who can write when woods invite,
 And woods are but a week away!





[Pg 50]
TO THE SUN

(Variations on a theme by Gilbert.)



 Shine on, Old Top, shine on!
 Across the realms of space
     Shine on!
 What though I       m in a sorry case?
 What though my collar is a wreck,
 And hangs a rag about my neck?
 What though at food I can but peck?
   Never you mind!
     Shine on!


 Shine on, Old Top, shine on!
 Through leagues of lifeless air
     Shine on!
 It       s true I       ve no more shirts to wear,
 My underwear is soaked,        tis true,
 My gullet is a redhot flue       
 But don       t let that unsettle you!
   Never you mind!
     Shine on! [It shines on.]





[Pg 51]
WHEN IT IS HOT

       And Nebuchadnezzar commanded the most mighty men
that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego,
and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.       



 Consider Mr. Shadrach,
   Of fiery furnace fame:
 He didn       t bleat about the heat
   Or fuss about the flame.
 He didn       t stew and worry,
   And get his nerves in kinks,
 Nor fill his skin with limes and gin
   And other        cooling drinks.       


 Consider Mr. Meshach,
   Who felt the furnace too:
 He let it sizz nor queried        Is
   It hot enough for you?       
 He didn       t mop his forehead,
   And hunt a shady spot;
 Nor did he say,        Gee! what a day!
   Believe me, it       s some hot.       


 Consider, too, Abed-nego,
   Who shared his comrades        plight:
 He didn       t shake his coat and make
   Himself a holy sight.
 He didn       t wear suspenders
   Without a coat and vest;
 Nor did he scowl and snort and howl,
   And make himself a pest.

[Pg 52]
 Consider, friends, this trio       
   How little fuss they made.
 They didn       t curse when it was worse
   Than ninety in the shade.
 They moved about serenely
   Within the furnace bright,
 And soon forgot that it was hot,
   With        no relief in sight.       





[Pg 53]
THE SIMPLE, HEARTFELT LAY



 Lives of poets oft remind us
   Not to wait too long for Time,
 But, departing, leave behind us
   Obvious facts embalmed in rime.


 Poems that we have to ponder
   Turn us prematurely gray;
 We are infinitely fonder
   Of the simple, heartfelt lay.


 Whitman       s Leaves of Grass is odious,
   Browning       s Ring and Book a bore.
 Bleat, O bards, in lines melodious,       
   Bleat that two and two is four!


 Must we hunt for hidden treasures?
   Nay! We want the heartfelt straight.
 Minstrel, sing, in obvious measures       
   Sing that four and four is eight!


 Whitman leads to easy slumbers,
   Browning makes us hunt the hay.
 Pipe, ye potes, in simplest numbers,
  Anything ye have to say.

A NOTE FROM MR. FLACCUS

(Concerning the verses that follow.)


Dear B. L. T.:

You know my        pomes.        Well, old man, I
was pretty young when I got them out of my system,
and they seem rather raw to me now       I       m
getting along, you know; so I       ve been thinking
that I       d do        em over again, file        em down, as we
used to say. Enclosed is the result of my labors.

I presume you are wondering why I have
done them into United States; but you know perfectly
well that a poet as much alive as I am to-day
must not only keep up with the procession, but
choose a thought-vehicle that has good springs
to it              beaucoup resiliency,        I s       pose you       d call it.

I hope you will like these new lines of mine
better than their prototypes.

Yours regardfully,
Q. H. F.
Helngon, November 15.

TO ARISTIUS FUSCUS

       Integer vit        scelerisque purus.       



 Fuscus, old scout, if a guy       s on the level
   That       s all the arsenal he       ll have to tote;
 Up to St. Peter or down to the Devil,
   No need to carry a gun in his coat.


 Prowling around, as you know is my habit,
   I met a wolf in the forest, and he
 Beat it for Wolfville and ran like a rabbit.
   (He was some wolf, too, receive it from me.)


 Where I may happen to camp is no matter,       
   Paris, Chicago, Ostend or St. Joe,       
 Like the old dame in the nursery patter
   I shall make music wherever I go.


 Drop me in Dawson or chuck me in Cadiz,
   Dump me in Kansas or plant me in Rome,       
 I shall keep on making love to the ladies:
   Where there       s a skirt is my notion of home.

DUETTO

       Donec gratus eram.       



             HORACE:
 What time my Lydia owned me lord
   No Persian king had much on Horace;
 And when you blew my bed and board
   I was some sad, believe me, Mawruss.


             LYDIA:
 What time you loved no other She,
   Before this Chlo       person signed you,
 I flourished like a green bay tree;
   Now I       m the Girl You Left Behind You.


             HORACE:
 This Chlo       dame that takes my eye
   Has so peculiar an allurance
 I would not hesitate to die
   If she could cop my life insurance.


             LYDIA:
 Well, as for that, I know a gent
   With whom it       s some delight to dally.
 With me he makes an awful dent;
   I       d perish once or twice for Cally.


             HORACE:
 Suppose our former love should go
   Into a new de luxe edition?
 Suppose I tie a can to Chlo,
   And let you play your old position?

[Pg 58]
             LYDIA:
 Why, then, you cork, you butterfly,
   You sweet, philandering, perjured villain,
 With you I       d love to live and die,

TO PYRRHA

       Quis multa gracilis.       



 What young tin whistle gent,
 Bedaubed with barber       s scent,       
   What cheapskate waits on you
   To woo,
         O Pyrrha?


 For whom the puff and rat
 And transformation that
   You bought a year ago
   Or so,
         O Pyrrha?


 Peeved? Not a bit. Not I
 I       m sorry for the guy.
   He draws a lovely lime
   This time,
         O Pyrrha!


 I       ve dipped. The wet ain       t fine.
 Hung on the votive line
   My duds. The gods can see

TO ARISTIUS FUSCUS

       My sweetly-smiling, sweetly-speaking Lalage.       



 Fuscus, take a tip from me:
   This here job       s no bed of roses,
 Not the cinch it seems to be,
   Not the pipe that one supposes.
       What care I, tho       , if I may
       Lallygag with Lalage.


 Every day there       s ink to spill,
   Tho        I may not feel like working.
 Every day a hole to fill;
   One must plug it       there       s no shirking.
       Oh, that I might all the day
       Lallygag with Lalage!


 People say,        Gee! what a snap,
   Turning paragraphs and verses.
 He       s the band on Fortune       s cap,
   Gets a barrel of ses-terces.       
       Let them gossip, while I play
       Hide and seek with Lalage.


 People hand me out advice:
         Hod, you       re doing too much drivel.
 Write us something sweet and nice.
   Stow the satire, chop the frivol.       
       But we have the rent to pay,
       Lalage; eh, Lalage?

[Pg 61]
 Ladies shy the saving sense
   Write me patronizing letters;
 And there are the writing gents,
   Always out to knock their betters.
       What cares Flaccus if he may
       Lallygag with Lalage!


 No, old top, the writing lay       s
   Not a bed of sweet geranium.
 Brickbats mingle with bouquets
   Shied at my devoted cranium.
       Does it peeve yours truly? Nay.
       Nothing can       with Lalage.


 Paste this, Fuscus, in your hat:
   Not a pesky thing can peeve me.
 Take it, too, from Horace flat,
   She       s some gal, is Lal, believe me.
       So I coin this word to-day,
             Lallygag              from Lalage.

TO SYLVIA



 Were I on the Latin lay,
 Were I turning Odes to-day,
 You would draw a gem from me,
 Little maid of mystery!


 In an Ode I       d love to spout you;
 I am simply bug about you.
 That       s the way!       the fairest peach
 Is the one that       s out of reach.


 I have toasted in my time
 Many a peach (and many a lime),
 All of them, I must confess,
 Lacking your elusiveness.


 Lalage, my well known flame,
 Was considerable dame;
 Likewise Lydia and Phyllis,
 Chlo      , Pyrrha, Amaryllis.


 Syl, if you had lived when they did
 You       d have had those damsels faded.
 (That will give you, girl, some notion
 Of your Flaccus       s devotion.)


 Yep. If I were doing Odes
 In my quondam favorite modes,
 With your image to qui-vive me
 I       d tear off some Ode, believe me!

AN ORIENTAL APOLOGY



 When the hour was come Prince Chun arose,
 And balanced a shoestring on his nose.
       From this some notion you will get,       
 Said he,        of China       s deep regret.       


 Now balancing upon his ear
 A stein of foaming lager beer,
       This attitude,        said he,        reveals
 How very sorry China feels.       


 Then spinning top-like on his cue,
       I can       t begin to tell to you
 The deep remorse we suffer for
 The death of your Ambassador.       


 Next, placing on his cue a plate,
 He said, as it        gan to gyrate:
       Nothing that       s happened in his reign
 Has caused my Emperor so much pain.       


 Upon his back he did declare,
 While juggling five balls in the air,
       This attitude       the humblest yet       
 Expresses personal regret.       


 Last, spreading out a deck of cards       
       Accept my Emperor       s regards.
 As our intentions were well meant,
 Pray overlook the incident.

THE DAY OF THE COMET

(May 18, 1910.)



 Here it is       Eighteenth of May!
 Dawneth now the fatal day
 When we take the awful veil
 Of the fearsome comet       s tail.
        Vale, Earth!


 What will happen, heaven knows;
 We can       t even guess, suppose,
 Hazard, speculate, surmise,
 Hint, conjecture, theorize,
        Or divine.


 Will we merely drill a hole
 Through the trailing aureole?
 Or will the prediction dire
 Of a world destroyed by fire
        Be fulfilled?


 Shall we crook our knees and pray
 Counting this the Judgment Day?
 Or preserve a cosmic ca       m,
 Caring not a cosmic dam
        What may come?


 There       s the rub. If we but knew
 We should know just what to do.
 Yes is just as good as No
 To all questions. Here we go!       
        Hang on tight!





[Pg 67]
THE MORNING AFTER

(May 19, 1910.)



 Here we are, friends, whole and hale
 In or through the comet       s tail;
 And as far as we can say,
 Matters are about as they
        Were before.


 Everything is much the same
 As before the comet came.
 Grasses grow and waters run       
 Nothing new beneath the sun       
        Same old sphere.


 Life is drab or life is gay,
 Thorny path or primrose way;
 All is common, all is strange;
       Down the ringing grooves of change       
        Spins the world.


 Change but of a humdrum kind.
 What we vaguely had in mind
 Was some new sensation or
 Thrill we never felt before.
        Vain desire!


 Nothing       s added to the stock:
 Same old shiver, same old shock.
 Round about the sun we       ll go
 In the same old status quo.
        Awful bore!

A BALLADE OF IRRESOLUTION



 Isolde, in the story old,
 When Ireland       s coast the vessel nears,
 And Death were fairer to behold,
 To Tristan gives        the cup that clears.       
 Straight to their fate the helmsman steers:
 Unknowing, each the potion sips....
 Comes echoing through the ghostly years
       Give me the philtre of thy lips!       


 Ah, that like Tristan I were bold!
 My soul into the future peers,
 And passion flags, and heart grows cold,
 And sicklied resolution veers.
 I see the Sister of the Shears
 Who sits fore       er and snips, and snips....
 Still falls upon my inward ears,
       Give me the philtre of thy lips!       


 Hero of lovers, largely soul       d!
 Imagination thee enspheres
 With song-enchanted wood and wold
 And casements fronting magic meres.
 Tristan, thy large example cheers
 The faint of heart; thy story grips!       
 My soul again that echo hears,
       Give me the philtre of thy lips!

 Who felled the spruce tree to the ground
 That grew in the forest primeval.

 This is the publisher bland and rich
 Who bought the roll of paper which
 Was made by the man with the paper mill
 Who bought the pulp that paid the bill
 Of the lumberjack with the murderous ax
 Who felled the spruce with lusty hacks
 That grew in the forest primeval.

 Who does the daily Newport drool
 That helps to make the publisher rich

 Who bought the pulp that paid the bill
 Of Ole Oleson the husky Swede
 Who did a foul and darksome deed
 When he swung his ax with vigor and vim
 And smote the spruce tree tall and trim
 That grew in the forest primeval.


 This is the shop girl Mag or Liz
 Who daily devours what news there is
 Concerning the lady far from slim
 Who changed the time of her ocean swim
 And excited the youth with the writing tool
 Who does the daily Newport drool
 For the pursy publisher bland and rich
 Who bought the innocent paper which
 Was made by the man with the paper mill
 Who bought the pulp that paid the bill[Pg 72]

HOW THEY MIGHT HAVE BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS



 We sprang to the motor, I, Joris and Dirck.
 I snapped on my goggles and got to my work.
       Hi, there!        yelled the cop in the helmet of white;
       Let her flicker!        said Joris, and into the night,
 With a sneer at the speed laws, we hurtled hell-bent
 To carry to Aix the good tidings from Ghent.


 The going was poor, we expected delay,
 And the usual livestock obstructed the way.
 At Boom we ran over a large yellow dog,
 At D      ffeld a chicken, at Mecheln a hog;
 What else, we       d no time to slow down to inquire;
 At Aerschot, confound it! we blew out a tire.


 I jacked up the axle and ripped off the shoe,
 And snapped on an extra that promised to do.
       All aboard!        I exclaimed as I cranked the machine,
 But something was wrong with the curst gasoline.
       By Hasselt!        Dirck groaned,        We       ll be half a day late;
 We ought to have sent the good tidings by freight.       


 False prophet! I tinkered a minute or two
 And again we were off like        a bolt from the blue.       [Pg 74]
 We ate up the hills at a forty-mile clip,
 And skidded the turns like the snap of a whip,
 Till we dashed into Aix and were pinched by a cop
 For failing to slow when commanded to stop.


       Now, wouldn       t that frost you!        said Joris, but we
 When we told the glad tidings were instantly free.
 The Mayor himself paid the ten dollars        fine,
 And blew us to dinner with six kinds of wine,
 Which (the burgesses voted, by common consent)
 Was no more than their due that brought good news from Ghent.

THE DINOSAUR



 Behold the mighty Dinosaur,
 Famous in prehistoric lore,
 Not only for his weight and strength
 But for his intellectual length.
 You will observe by these remains
 The creature had two sets of brains       
 One in his head (the usual place),
 The other at his spinal base.
 Thus he could reason a priori
 As well as a posteriori.
 No problem bothered him a bit;
 He made both head and tail of it.
 So wise he was, so wise and solemn,
 Each thought filled just a spinal column.
 If one brain found the pressure strong
 It passed a few ideas along;
 If something slipped his forward mind
        Twas rescued by the one behind;
 And if in error he was caught
 He had a saving afterthought.
 As he thought twice before he spoke
 He had no judgments to revoke;
 For he could think, without congestion,
 Upon both sides of every question.


 Oh, gaze upon this model beast,
 Defunct ten million years at least.

A BALLADE OF CAP AND BELLS



 When as a dewdrop joy enspheres
 This pleasant planet, arched with blue,
 When every prospect charms and cheers,
 And all the world is fair to view       
 Who does not envy (have not you?)
 That mortal, by Thalia kissed,
 Who plies, in plumes of cockatoo,
 The blithesome trade of humorist?


 But when the wind of fortune veers,
 And blue-white skies turn leaden hue,
 When every pleasant prospect blears
 And all the weary world       s askew       
 Who then would envy (if he knew)
 Jack Point the jester, glum and trist;
 Or ply, tho        first of all the crew,
 The dismal trade of humorist?


 Ah, jocund trifles writ in tears,
 And merry stanzas steeped in rue!
 When all the world in drab appears
 The fool must still in motley woo.
 Tho        bitter be the cud he chew,
 Still must he grind his foolish grist;
 Still must he ply, the long day through,
 The tragic trade of humorist!

GENTLE DOCTOR BROWN



 It was a gentle sawbones and his name was Doctor Brown.
 His auto was the terror of a small suburban town.
 His practice, quite amazing for so trivial a place,
 Consisted of the victims of his homicidal pace.


 So constant was his practice and so high his motor       s gear
 That at knocking down pedestrians he never had a peer;
 But it must, in simple justice, be as truly written down
 That no man could be more thoughtful than gentle Doctor Brown.


 Whatever was the errand on which Doctor Brown was bent
 He       d stop to patch a victim up and never charged a cent.
 He       d always pause, whoever        twas he happened to run down:
 A humane and a thoughtful man was gentle Doctor Brown.


       How fortunate,        he would observe,        how fortunate        twas I
 That knocked you galley-west and heard your wild and wailing cry.[Pg 79]
 There are some heartless wretches who would leave you here alone,
 Without a sympathetic ear to catch your dying moan.


       Such callousness,        said Doctor Brown,        I cannot comprehend;
 To fathom such indifference I simply don       t pretend.
 One ought to do his duty, and I never am remiss.
 A simple word of thanks is all I ask. Here, swallow this!       


 Then, reaching in the tonneau, he       d unpack his little kit,
 And perform an operation that was workmanlike and fit.
       You may survive,        said Doctor Brown;        it       s happened once or twice.
 If not, you       ve had the benefit of competent advice.       


 Oh, if all our motormaniacs were equally humane,
 How little bitterness there       d be, or reason to complain!
 How different our point of view if we were ridden down
 By lunatics as thoughtful as gentle Doctor Brown!

IN THE GALLERY



 Weirder than the pictures
 Are the folks who come
 With their owlish strictures       
 Telling why they       re bum.
 Of all lines of babble
 This one has the call:
 Picture gallery gabble
 Is the best of all.


 Literary fluffle
 Never, never cloys;
 Much has Mrs. Guffle
 Added to my joys.
 For that chitter-chatter
 I delight to fall.
 But the picture patter
 Is the best of all.


 With the music highbrows
 I delight to chat,
 Elevating my brows
 Over this and that.
 Music tittle-tattle
 Never fails to thrall.
 But the picture prattle
 Is the best of all.


 Sociologic rub-dub
 I delight to hear;[Pg 81]
 Philosophic flub-dub
 Titillates my ear.
 Lovelier yet the spiffle
 In the picture hall;
 For the picture piffle
 Is the best of all.


 Weirder than the pictures
 Are the folks who stand
 Passing owlish strictures,
 Catalogue in hand.
 Hear the bunk they babble
 Under every wall.
 Yes. The gallery gabble
 Is the best of all.

ALWAYS

       Il y a tous les jours quelque dam chose.       
           Abelard to Heloise.



 When Mrs. Mead was full of groans,
   When symptoms of all sorts assailed her,
 She sent for bluff old Doctor Jones,
   And told him all the things that ailed her.
 It took her nearly half the day,
   And when she finished out the string       
       Ye-e-s, Mrs. Mead,        drawled Doctor J.,
         There       s always some dam thing.       


 I like the line. It       s worth a ton
   Of optimistic commonplaces.
 It       s tonic, it refreshes one,
   It cheers, it stimulates, it braces.
 It summarizes things so well;
   It has the philosophic ring.
 Has Kant or Hegel more to tell?
         There       s always some dam thing.       


 The dean of all the cheer-up school
   Adjures sad hearts to cease repining,
 And intimates that, as a rule,
   The sun behind the cloud is shining.
       Into each life                      You know the rest;
   No need to finish out the string.
 Longfellow boiled might be expressed,
         There       s always some dam thing.       

[Pg 83]
 When things go wrong I do not read
   The cheer-up poets, great or lesser.
 To soothe my soul I do not need
   The Neo-Thought of Mr. Dresser.
 Sufficient for each working day,
   With all the worries it may bring,
 That helpful line by Doctor J.,
         There       s always some dam thing.

THE MODERN MARINER



 A dry sheet and a lazy sea,
   And a wind so far from fast
 It barely floats the owner       s flag
   That flutters at the mast       
 That flutters at the mast, my boys;
   So while the sky is free
 Of cloud we       ll take a yachtsman       s chance
   And venture out to sea.


 The aneroid has dropped a tenth!
   Back, back across the bar
 To a harbor snug, and a long cold drink,
   And a big fat black cigar       
 A big fat black cigar, my boys;
   While, on an even keel,
 The Swedish chef out-chefs himself
   In getting up a meal.


 Give me a soft and gentle wind,
   A fleckless azure sky;
 I care not for your        snoring breeze       
   And dinners heaving high       
 And dinners heaving high, my boys,
   Make no great hit with me;
 So when the breeze begins to snore
   We       ll not put out to sea.

[Pg 85]
 There       s laughter in yon beach hotel,
   And summer girls a crowd;
 And hark the music, mariners,
   The band is piping loud!
 The band is piping loud, my boys,

 Come, fly the owner       s-absent flag
   And join the revelry.

PANDEAN PIPEDREAMS

(Induced by smoking        Pagan Pickings.       )


I


This is something that I heard,
As the fluting of a bird,
On a certain drowsy day,
When my pipe was under way.
I was weary of the town,
And the going up and down;
Sick of streets and sick of noise,       
And I pined for Pagan joys.


 Daphne, here it is July!
 Just the month, my love, to fly
 To a sylvan solitude
 In the green and ancient wood.
 We will trip it as we go
 On the neo-Pagan toe,
 Sunny days and starry nights,
 Savoring the wild delights
 Of a turbulent desire
 That may set the wood on fire.


 We will play at hunt-the-fawn,
 In the neo-Dorian dawn.
 You will scamper through the brake,
 And I       ll follow in your wake       

[Pg 89]
 As the young Apollo ran
 In the piping days of Pan.
 You       ll escape me, without doubt,
 For I       m just a trifle stout;
 But, when I have lagged behind,
 Waiting for my second wynde,
 From some pretty hiding-place
 Will emerge your laughing face;
 I shall glimpse your eyes of blue,
 Hear your merry        Peek-a-boo!       


 What to wear? The Pagan plan
 Contemplates a coat of tan;
 But I fear we shall require
 Just a trifle more attire.
 Bushes scratch and brambles sting;
 Insect myriads are a-wing;       
 Heavens, how mosquitoes swarm
 When the woodland air is warm.
 (Mem: To take, when we elope,
 Tanglewood Mosquito Dope.)


 Do you like the picture, dear?
 Have you aught of doubt or fear?
 Have you any criticism
 Of my neo-Paganism?
 If not, dearie, let us fly
 To that passion-ripening sky,
 Where our souls may have their fling,
 And our every care take wing.

[Pg 90]
So the bird song fluted by,
Like a vagrant summer sigh       
Came, and passed, and was no more;
And my pleasant dream was o       er.
For arose the wraith of Doubt;
And I knew my pipe was out.


      
[Pg 91]
II


This is something that befell
When my pipe was drawing well       
Something, rather, that I heard
As the fluting of a bird.


 Daphne, come and live with me
 In a Pagan greenery.
 Life will then be naught but play,
 One long Pagan holiday.
 We will play at hide and seek
 In the alders by the creek;
 Sport amid the cascade       s smother.
 Splashing water at each other;       
 Every moment pleasure wooing,
 Every moment something doing.
 If we talk, we       ll talk of Love:
 All its arguments we       ll prove.
 Such a mental rest you       ll find.
 Leave your intellect behind.


 Night will come, (for come it will,
        Spite the fluting on the hill,)
 And we       ll pitch a cozy camp
 Where it isn       t quite so damp.
 While you dry your hair and laze
 By the campfire       s violet blaze,
 I will rob a balsam tree
 To construct a house for thee.
 What so dear as to be wooed
 In a sylvan solitude?

[Pg 92]
 What so sweet as Pagan vows
 Whispered in a house of boughs?
 Pagan love       s without alloy.
 Pagan kisses never cloy.
 Arms that cling in Pagan fashion
 Never tire. A Pagan passion
 Is the only kind I know
 That outlives a winter       s snow.
 Daphne, Daphne, let us fly!
 You       re a Pagan       so am I.


So the fluting on the hill
Passed and died, and all was still.
So the Pagan Pickings died,
And I laid the pipe aside.

THE LAUNDRY OF LIFE

(An Adventure in Sentiment.)



 Life is a laundry in which we
 Are ironed out, or soon or late.
 Who has not known the irony
            Of fate?


 We enter it when we are born,
 Our colors bright. Full soon they fade.
 We leave it        done up,        old and worn,
            And frayed;


 Frayed round the edges, worn and thin       
 Life is a rough old linen slinger.
 Who has not lost a button in
            Life       s wringer?


 With other linen we are tubbed,
 With other linen often tangled;
 In open court we then are scrubbed,
            And mangled.


 Some take a gloss of happiness
 The hardest wear can not diminish;
 Others, alas! get a        domes-
            Tic finish.

WISDOM IN A CAPSULE


       If she be not so to me.
   What care I how fair she be?       
       The Shepherd       s Resolution.



 Here we have in this truism
 Mr. James       s pragmatism.
 Test your troubles day by day
 With it, and they fly away.
 Is the weather boiling hot,
 Hot enough to boil a pot       
 If it be not so to me,
 What care I how hot it be?


 Take a pudding made of bread;
 Much against it has been said;
 But it does not lack defense       
 Many say it is immense.
 Be it damned or be it blessed,
 Let us make the acid test       
 If it be not so to me,
 What care I how good it be?


 So with every blooming thing
 That has power to soothe or sting;
 Ships or shoes or sealing wax,
 Carrots, comets, carpet tacks.
 Every philosophic need
 Covered by this capsule creed:
 If it be not so to me,
 What care I how  it be?

THE LAND OF RAINBOW       S-END



 Young Faintheart lay on a wayside bank,
   Full prey to doubts and fears,
 When he did espy come trudging by
   A Pilgrim bent with years.
 His back was bowed and his step was slow,
   But his faith no years could bend,
 As he eagerly pressed to the rose-lit west
   And the Land of Rainbow       s-End.


       It       s ho, for a pack!        sang the Pilgrim gray,
        And a stout oak staff for friend,
And it       s over the hills and far away
  To the Land of Rainbow       s-End!       


       Thou       rt old,        young Faintheart cried,        thou       rt old,
   And there       s many a league to go;
 And still thou seekest the pot of gold
   At the farther end of the bow.       
       I am old, I am old,        said the Pilgrim gray,
         But ever my way I       ll wend
 To the rose-lit hills of the dying day
   And the Land of Rainbow       s-End.       


       Come, rest thee, rest thee by my side;
   Give o       er thy doomsday quest.       
       Have done, have done!        the Pilgrim cried:
         The light wanes in the west.[Pg 96]
 The road is long, but I shall not tire;
   I will lay my bones, God send,
 By the beautiful City of Heart       s Desire,
   In the Land of Rainbow       s-End.       


       Then it       s ho, for a pack!        sang the Pilgrim gray,
        And a stout oak staff for friend,
And it       s over the hills and far away
  To the Land of Rainbow       s-End.       





[Pg 97]
A BALLADE OF A BORE



 When the weather is warm and the glass running high
 And the odors of Araby tincture the air;
 When the sun is aloft in a white and blue sky,
 And the morrow holds promise of falling as fair;       
 In spring or in summer I       m free to declare,
 And the same I am equally free to maintain,
 One person has power my peace to impair:
 The man who tells limericks gives me a pain.


 When the foliage flushes and summer is by,
 And russet and red are the popular wear;
 When the song of the woodland is changed to a sigh
 And the horn of the hunter is heard by the hare;       
 In the season of autumn I       m free to declare,
 And my language is lucid and simple and plain,
 One person       s acquaintance I freely forswear:
 The man with the limerick gives me a pain.


 When the landscape is iced and the snow feathers fly,
 When the fields are all bald and the trees are all bare,
 And the prospect which nature presents to the eye
 Is chiefly distinguished by glitter and glare;       
[Pg 98]
 In the season of winter I       m free to declare
 That the limerick person is flat and inane.
 This person, I think, we could easily spare:
 The man who tells limericks gives me a pain.

      

       L       Envoi


 From New Year to Christmas I       m free to declare
 That, for ways that are dull and for verse that is vain,
 One bore is peculiar       and not at all rare:
 The man with the limerick gives me a pain.





[Pg 99]
THE POLE

(Tune:        Carcassonne.       )



 I       m an old man, I       m eighty-three,
   I seldom get away;
 My work, it keeps me close at home       
   I have no time for play.
 If it were not for the journey back,
   That so fatigues a soul,
 I       d like to take a little trip       
   I never have seen the Pole.


        Tis said that in that favored place
   There is no heat or drouth;
 And that, whichever way you turn,
   You       re looking south-by-south.
 Some say there is a flagstaff there,
   Some say there is a hole.
 Think of the years that I have lived
   And never have seen the Pole!


 The parson a hundred times is right       
   We ought to stay at home.
 I       m an old man, I       m eighty-three,
   I have no call to roam.
 And yet if I could somehow find
   The time       God bless my soul!       
 I think that I would die content
   If I only could see the Pole!

[Pg 100]
 My brother has seen Baraboo,
   If so he speak the truth;
 My wife and son they both have been
   As far as to Duluth;
 My cousin cruised to Eastport, Maine,
   On a ship that carried coal;
 I       ve been as far as Mackinac       
   But I never have seen the Pole!





[Pg 101]
SH-H-H-H!


       Mr. Mabie is now reading the summer books.       
       The Ladies        Home Journal.



 What shall we buy for a summer       s day?
 What is good reading and what is not?
 Mabie will tell us       we wait his say;
 For Mabie alone can know what       s what.
 Meanwhile the world is as still as death;
 Mute inquiry is in men       s looks;
 Everybody is holding his breath       
 Mabie is reading the summer books.


 The suns are at pause in the cosmic race;
 The mills of the gods have ceased to grind;
 The only sound that is heard in space
 Is the rhythmic clicking of Mabie       s mind.
 Elsewhere silence, or near or far       
 Chattering Pleiads or babbling brooks;
 For the whisper has passed from star to star:
       Mabie is reading the summer books.       





[Pg 102]
THE VANISHED FAY



 Tell me, whither do they go,
 All the Little Ones we know?
 They        grow up        before our eyes,
 And the fairy spirit flies.
 Time the Piper, pied and gay       
 Does he lure them all away?
 Do they follow after him,
 Over the horizon       s brim?


 Daughter       s growing fair to see,
 Slim and straight as popple tree.
 Still a child in heart and head,
 But       the fairy spirit       s fled.
 As a fay at break of day,
 Little One has flown away,
 On the stroke of fairy bell       
 When and whither, who can tell?


 Still her childish fancies weave
 In the Land of Make Believe;
 And her love of magic lore
 Is as avid as before.
 Dollies big and dollies small
 Still are at her beck and call.
 But for all this pleasant play,
 Little One has gone away.

[Pg 103]
 Whither, whither have they flown,
 All the fays we all have known?
 To what        faery lands forlorn       
 On the sound of elfin horn?
 As she were a woodland sprite,
 Little One has vanished quite.
 Waves the wand of Oberon:
 Cock has crowed       the fay is gone!





[Pg 104]
AUTUMN REVERY



 When the leaves are falling crimson
   And the worm is off its feed,
 When the rag weed and the jimson
   Have agreed to go to seed,
 When the air in forest bowers
   Has a tang like Rhenish wine,
 And to breathe it for two hours
   Makes you feel you       d like to dine,
 When the frost is on the pumpkin
   And the corn is in the shock,
 And the cheek of country bumpkin
   City faces seems to mock,       
 When you come across a ditty
   (Like this one) of Autumn       s charm,
 Then it       s pleasant in the city,
   Where they keep the houses warm.




[Pg 105]
THE RECOIL



 I met a friend of lofty brow       
 As lofty as the laws allow.
 I said to him,        You       ll know, I       m sure       
 What       s doing now in litrychoor?       
 Said he:        I hate the very name;
 I       m weary of the blooming game.
 I read, whenever I have time,
 Something by Phillips Oppenheim.       


       Cheer up!        said I.        What       s new in Art?       
 You drift around the picture mart.
 What do you think of Mr. Blum?       
 Some say he       s great, some say he       s bum.       
       I       m strong for Blum,        my friend replied;
       His pictures are so queer and pied.
 I wouldn       t change them if I could;
 I       d rather have things queer than good.       


 I spoke of this, I spoke of that,
 But everything was stale and flat.
 Said I,        You once adored the chaste,
 You used to have such perfect taste.       
       Good taste,        he wailed,        brings but distress,
        Tis an affliction, nothing less;
 While those whose taste is punk and vile
 Are happy all the blessed while.       

[Pg 106]
       Oh, take a brace, old man!        said I.
       Let me prescribe a nip of rye,
 And then we       ll go to see a play;
 I       ve two for Barrymore to-day.       
       No, no,        he groaned;               twould be a bore,
 With all respect to Barrymore.       
 Said I:        Then whither shall we go?       
 Said he:        A moving picture show.       





[Pg 107]
THE CORONATION

Lang Syne.



 Twas a holy mystery
 In the days of chivalry.
 More than pageant was the Rite
 In the sight of clod and knight.
 Sword and Scepter, Orb and Rod,
 Faith in self and faith in God;
 Oaths of Homage fiercely flung,
 Faith in heart and faith in tongue;       
   Gone the things that meaning gave
         With the old world to the grave.       

      
1911.


 Knightly faith was born to fade:
 Now the Rite is masquerade.
 Now a cockney paladin
 Winds a penny horn of tin.
 Where in reverence heads were bowed
 Surges now a careless crowd;
       Muddied oafs        and        flanneled fools       
 Jostle        Yanks        with camping stools;       
   Gone the things that meaning gave
         With the old world to the grave.       





[Pg 108]
SONS OF BATTLE



 Let us have peace, and Thy blessing,
   Lord of the Wind and the Rain,
 When we shall cease from oppressing,
   From all injustice refrain;
 When we hate falsehood and spurn it;
   When we are men among men.
 Let us have peace when we earn it       
   Never an hour till then.


 Let us have rest in Thy garden,
   Lord of the Rock and the Green,
 When there is nothing to pardon,
   When we are whitened and clean.
 Purge us of skulking and treason,
   Help us to put them away.
 We shall have rest in Thy season;
   Till then the heat of the fray.


 Let us have peace in Thy pleasure,
   Lord of the Cloud and the Sun;
 Grant to us        ons of leisure
   When the long battle is done.
 Now we have only begun it;
   Stead us!       we ask nothing more.
 Peace       rest       but not till we       ve won it       
   Never an hour before.





[Pg 109]
MY LADY NEW YORK



 O siren of tresses peroxide,
   And heart that is hard as a flint,
 Blue orbs of complacency ox-eyed,
   That light at the mark of the mint,
 Ears only for jingle of joybells,
   A conscience as light as a cork       
 You are wedded to follies and foibles,
   My Lady New York.


 True, you have (not enough, tho       , to hurt you)
   Your moods and your manners austere;
 You have visions and vapors of virtue,
   And        reform        for a time has your ear;
 But of chaste Puritanic embraces
   You soon have enough and to spare,
 And then you kick over the traces,
   And virtue forswear.


 So go it, milady! Foot fleetly
   The paths that are primrose and gay;
 Abandon your fancy completely
   To follies and fads of the day.
       Reform        is a something that throttles
   The joys of the pace that       s intense       
 Smash hearts, reputations, and bottles,
   And ding the expense!





[Pg 110]
BALLADE OF THE PIPESMOKE CARRY



 The Ancient Wood is white and still,
 Over the pines the bleak wind blows,
 Voiceless the brook and mute the rill,
 Silence too where the river flows.
 Still I catch the scent of the rose
 And hear the white-throat       s roundelay,
 Footing the trail that Memory knows,
 Over the hills and far away.


 I have only a pipe to fill:
 Weaving, wreathing rings disclose
 A trail that flings straight up the hill,
 Straight as an arrow       s flight. For those
 Who fare by night the pole star glows
 Above the mountain top. By day
 A blasted pine the pathway shows
 Over the hills and far away.


 The Ancient Wood is white and chill,
 But what know I of wintry woes?
 The Pipesmoke Trail is mine at will       
 Naught may hinder and none oppose.
 Such the power the pipe bestows,
 When the wilderness calls I may
 Tramping go, as I smoke and doze,
 Over the hills and far away.

      
[Pg 111]
       L       Envoi


 Deep in the canyons lie the snows:
 They shall vanish if I but say       
 If my fancy a-roving goes
 Over the hills and far away.





[Pg 112]
POST-VACATIONAL



 You have heard that mildewed story,
 That tradition horned and hoary,
   That it wearies one to roam,
         Past a doubt;
 That one vainly on vacation
 Tries to find recuperation,
   Till he hunts his happy home
         Tuckered out.


 That abroad there is no comfort,
 That a man must journey home for        t       
   You have heard that whiskered wheeze,
         Have you not?
        Tis a commonplace to cavil
 At the        luxuries of travel,       
   For in travel lack of ease
         Is your lot.


 You have heard that gag historic;
 It was often sprung by Yorick;
   It       s as old as Noah       s ark
         And its crew.
 It       s the commonest (at basis)
 Of all common commonplaces;       
   So I merely would remark
         That       it       s true.





[Pg 113]
THE BARDS WE QUOTE



 Whene       er I quote I seldom take
 From bards whom angel hosts environ;
 But usually some damned rake
            Like Byron.


 Of Whittier I think a lot,
 My fancy to him often turns;
 But when I quote        tis some such sot
            As Burns.


 I       m very fond of Bryant, too,
 He brings to me the woodland smelly;
 Why should I quote that        village roo,       
            P. Shelley?


 I think Felicia Hemans great,
 I dote upon Jean Ingelow;
 Yet quote from such a reprobate
            As Poe.


 To quote from drunkard or from rake
 Is not a proper thing to do.
 I find the habit hard to break,
            Don       t you?





[Pg 114]
THE PERSISTENT POET



       I remember, I remember              
   Something special? Not a bit.
 But, you see, this is November,
   And Remember rimes with it.




[Pg 115]
HENCE THESE RIMES



 Tho        my verse is exact,
   Tho        it flawlessly flows,
 As a matter of fact
   I would rather write prose.


 While my harp is in tune,
   And I sing like the birds,
 I would really as soon
   Write in straightaway words.


 Tho        my songs are as sweet
   As Apollo e       er piped,
 And my lines are as neat
   As have ever been typed,


 I would rather write prose       
   I prefer it to rime;
 It       s less hard to compose,
   And it takes me less time.


       Well, if that be the case,       
   You are moved to inquire,
       Why appropriate space
   For extolling your lyre?       


 I can only reply
   That this form I elect
        Cause it pleases the eye,
   And I like the effect.





[Pg 116]
THE OLD ROLLER TOWEL



 How dear to this heart is the old roller towel
   Which fond recollection presents to my view.
 It hung like a pall on the wall of the washroom,
   And gathered the grime of the linotype crew.
 The sink and the soap and the lye that stood by it
   Remain; but the towel is gone past recall.
 O tempora! Also, O mores! Sic transit
   The time-honored towel that creaked on the wall.
 The grimy old towel, the slimy old towel,
 The tacky old towel that hung on the wall.


 Now hangs in the washroom a huge roll of paper       
   The old printer       s towel we       ll never see more.
 The new (see directions) is        used like a blotter,       
   And crumpled and scattered in wads on the floor.
 And often, when drying my hands in this fashion,
   The tears of remembrance will gather and fall,
 And I sigh (though I       m not what you       d call sentimental)
   For the classic old towel that propped up the wall.
 The sainted old towel, the tainted old towel,
 The gooey old towel that hung on the wall.





[Pg 117]
UP CULTURE       S HILL

(The confession of a club lady.)



 The path up Culture       s Hill is steep,
   And weary is the way,
 With very little time for sleep
   And none at all for play.


 She that this toilsome task essays
   Must never bat an eye,
 But keep her firm, unwavering gaze
   Forever fixed on high.


 For should she ever careless grow,
   And let her glances stray
 Down to the shallow vale below,
   Where Pleasure       s Court holds sway       


 Lured by the thrice forbidden fruit,
   She       d lose her equipoise,
 And like a wayward Pleiad shoot
   Down to forbidden joys.


 I       ve been but short time on the road,
   My courage still is strong;
 Yet often have I felt the goad
   That hurries me along.


 I       ve fallen over Maeterlinck,
   And bumped myself to tears,
 Burne-Jones       s pictures made me blink,
   And Wagner hurts my ears.

[Pg 118]
 I       ve stumbled over Ibsen humps
   And over Rembrandt rocks,
 I       ve got some fierce Debussy bumps,
   Some awful Nietsche knocks.


 I       m wearied by the ceaseless quest,
   I       m wayworn and footsore.
 I       ve Culture till I cannot rest       
   Yet still I climb for more.


 But oh, when all is done and said,
   Upon some manly breast
 I       d like to lay my tired head
   And take a good long rest.





[Pg 119]
THE PASSIONAL NOTE

       The erotic motive is almost entirely absent from American
poetry. Even our younger American poets are more
profoundly interested in the why and wherefore of things
than in the girdle of Helen or the gleaming limbs of        the
white implacable Aphrodite.              
       Mr. Sylvester Viereck.



 In the years of my season erotic,
   When Eros was lord of my days,
 And I loved, with a love idiotic,
   The Mabels and Madges and Mays;
 When a purple and passionate lyric
   Would sing all the night in my head,       
 I yearned, like the young Mr. Viereck,
   For everything red.


 I doted on poems of passion,
   And put my own pantings in rime,
 To celebrate, after a fashion,
   The damsels who took up my time.
 I fed upon Swinburne, believe me,
   I feasted on Byron and Burns,
 And couplets from Sappho would give me
   Most exquisite turns.


 How apparent it was that our songbirds       
   Our Emerson, Lowell, and Payne,
 And Bryant and Drake       were the wrong birds
   To pipe to the passional strain.
[Pg 120]
 There was, in a word, nothing doing
   In all of the rimes that they wrote;
 They seemed to be always pursuing
   The ethical note.


 What truth, I inquired, was so mighty,
   What ethical thing was so rare,
 As the limbs of the white Aphrodite
   Or a strand of her heaven-kissed hair!
 The girdle of red-headed Helen
   Outweighed all the wherefores and whys,
 And Wisdom elected to dwell in
   A pair of blue eyes.


Now lyrical sizzlers and scorchers
   Fail somehow to set me ablaze;
 No longer are exquisite tortures
   Provoked by these passionate lays.
 I       ve tinned       and I can       t say I       ve missed        em       
   The poems of passion and sin.
Some things one gets out of one       s system,
   And other things in.





[Pg 121]
L       ENVOI.



       Go, little book,        as Poet Southey said;
   You might be better and you might be worse.
 With just one word of warning you are sped:
   Remember, you       re not Poetry       you       re Verse.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
