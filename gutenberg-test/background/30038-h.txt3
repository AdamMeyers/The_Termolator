NOTE


For the privilege of reprinting the rimes gathered
here I am indebted to the courtesy of
the Chicago Tribune and Puck, in whose pages
most of them first appeared. &ldquo;The Lay of St.
Ambrose&rdquo; is new.

One reason for rounding up this fugitive
verse and prisoning it between covers was this:
Frequently&mdash;more or less&mdash;I receive a request
for a copy of this jingle or that, and it is easier
to mention a publishing house than to search
through ancient and dusty files.

The other reason was that I wanted to.

B. L. T.




[Pg 7]
TO MY READERS


Not merely of this book,&mdash;but a larger company,
with whom, through the medium of the Chicago
Tribune, I have been on very pleasant terms for
several years,&mdash;this handful of rime is joyously
dedicated.




[Pg 9]

THE LAY OF ST. AMBROSE


&ldquo;And hard by doth dwell, in St. Catherine&#8217;s cell,
 Ambrose, the anchorite old and grey.&rdquo;
 &mdash;The Lay of St. Nicholas.




 Ambrose the anchorite old and grey
   Larruped himself in his lonely cell,
 And many a welt on his pious pelt
   The scourge evoked as it rose and fell.


 For hours together the flagellant leather
   Went whacketty-whack with his groans of pain;
 And the lay-brothers said, with a wag of the head,
  &ldquo;Ambrose has been at the bottle again.&rdquo;


 And such, in sooth, was the sober truth;
   For the single fault of this saintly soul
 Was a desert thirst for the cup accurst,&mdash;
   A quenchless love for the Flowing Bowl.


 When he woke at morn with a head forlorn
   And a taste like a last-year swallow&#8217;s nest,
 He would kneel and pray, then rise and flay
   His sinful body like all possessed.


 Frequently tempted, he fell from grace,
   And as often he found the devil to pay;
 But by diligent scourging and diligent purging
   He managed to keep Old Nick at bay.

[Pg 10]
 This was the plight of our anchorite,&mdash;
   An endless penance condemned to dree,&mdash;
 When it chanced one day there came his way
   A Mystical Book with a golden Key.


 This Mystical Book was a guide to health,
   That none might follow and go astray;
 While a turn of the Key unlocked the wealth
   That all unknown in the Scriptures lay.


 Disease is sin, the Book defined;
   Sickness is error to which men cling;
 Pain is merely a state of mind,
   And matter a non-existent thing.


 If a tooth should ache, or a leg should break,
   You simply &ldquo;affirm&rdquo; and it&#8217;s sound again.
 Cut and contusion are only delusion,
   And indigestion a fancied pain.


 For pain is naught if you &ldquo;hold a thought,&rdquo;
   Fevers fly at your simple say;
 You have but to affirm, and every germ
   Will fold up its tent and steal away.




 From matin gong to even-song
   Ambrose pondered this mystic lore,
 Till what had seemed fiction took on a conviction
   That words had never possessed before.

[Pg 11]
&ldquo;If pain,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;is a state of mind,
   If a rough hair shirt to silk is kin,&mdash;
 If these things are error, pray where&#8217;s the terror
   In scourging and purging oneself of sin?


&ldquo;It certainly seemeth good to me,
   By and large, in part and in whole.
 I&#8217;ll put it in practice and find if it fact is,
   Or only a mystical rigmarole.&rdquo;




 The very next night our anchorite
   Of the Flowing Bowl drank long and deep.
 He argued this wise: &ldquo;New Thought applies
   No fitter to lamb than it does to sheep.&rdquo;


 When he woke at morn with a head forlorn
   And a taste akin to a parrot&#8217;s cage,
 He knelt and prayed, then up and flayed
   His sinful flesh in a righteous rage.


 Whacketty-whack on breast and back,
   Whacketty-whack, before, behind;
 But he held the thought as he laid it on,
  &ldquo;Pain is merely a state of mind.&rdquo;


 Whacketty-whack on breast and back,
   Whacketty-whack on calf and shin;
 And the lay-brothers said, with a wag of the head,
  &ldquo;Ain&#8217;t he the glutton for discipline!&rdquo;



[Pg 12]
 Now every night our anchorite
   Was exceedingly tight when he went to bed.
 The scourge that once pained him no longer restrained him,
   Nor even the fear of an aching head.


 For he woke at morn with a pate as clear
   As the silvery chime of the matin bell;
 And without any jogging he fell to his flogging,
   And larruped himself in his lonely cell.


 But the leather had lost its power to sting;
   To pangs of the flesh he was now immune;
 His rough hair shirt no longer hurt,
   Nor the pebbles he wore in his wooden shoon.


 When conscience was troubled he cheerfully doubled
   His matinal dose of discipline;&mdash;
 A deuce of a scourging, sufficient for purging
   The Devil himself of original sin.


 Whacketty-whack on breast and back,
   Whacketty-whack from morn to noon;
 Whacketty-whacketty-whacketty-whack!&mdash;
   Till the abbey rang with the dismal tune.


 Deacon and prior, lay-brother and friar
   Exclaimed at these whoppings spectacular;
 And even the Abbot remarked that the habit
   Of scourging oneself might be carried too far.

[Pg 13]
&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am pleased to see
   Such penance as never was known before;
 But you raise such a racket in dusting your jacket,
   The noise is becoming a bit of a bore.


&ldquo;How would it do if you whaled yourself
   From eight to ten or from one to three?
 Or if &lsquo;More&rsquo; is your motto, pray hire a grotto;
   I know of one you can have rent free.&rdquo;




 Ambrose the anchorite bowed his head,
   And girded his loins and went away.
 He rented a cavern not far from a tavern,
   And tippled by night and scourged by day.


 The more the penance the more the sin,
   The more he whopped him the more he drank;
 Till his hair fell out and his cheeks fell in,
   And his corpulent figure grew long and lank.


 At Whitsuntide he up and died,
   While flaying himself for his final spree.
 And who shall say whether &#8217;twas liquor or leather
   That hurried him into eternity?


 They made him a saint, as well they might,
   And gave him a beautiful aureole.
 And&mdash;somehow or other, this circle of light
   Suggests the rim of the Flowing Bowl.




[Pg 14]
TO A TALL SPRUCE



 Pride of the forest primeval,
 Peer of the glorious pine,
 Doomed to an end that is evil,
 Fearful the fate that is thine!


 Peer of the glorious pine,
 Now the landlooker has found you,
 Fearful the fate that is thine&mdash;
 Fate of the spruces around you.


 Now the landlooker has found you,
 Stripped of your beautiful plume&mdash;
 Fate of the spruces around you&mdash;
 Swiftly you&#8217;ll draw to your doom.


 Stripped of your beautiful plume,
 Bzzng! into logs they will whip you.
 Swiftly you&#8217;ll draw to your doom;
 To the pulp mill they will ship you.


 Bzzng! into logs they will whip you,
 Lumbermen greedy for gold.
 To the pulp mill they will ship you.
 Hearken, there&#8217;s worse to be told!


 Lumbermen greedy for gold
 Over your ruins will caper.
 Hearken, there&#8217;s worse to be told:
 You will be made into paper!

[Pg 15]
 Over your ruins will caper
 Murderous shavers and hooks.
 You will be made into paper!
 You will be made into books!


 Murderous shavers and hooks
 Swiftly your pride will diminish.
 You will be made into books!
 Horrible, horrible finish!


 Swiftly your pride will diminish.
 You will become a romance!
 Horrible, horrible finish!
 Fate has no sadder mischance.


 You will become a romance,
 Filled with &ldquo;Gadzooks!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Have at you!&rdquo;
 Fate has no sadder mischance;
 It would wring tears from a statue.


 Filled with &ldquo;Gadzooks!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Have at you!&rdquo;
 You may become a &ldquo;Lazarre&rdquo;&mdash;
 (It would wring tears from a statue)&mdash;
&ldquo;Graustark,&rdquo; &ldquo;Stovepipe of Navarre.&rdquo;


 You may become a &ldquo;Lazarre&rdquo;;
 Fate has still worse it can turn on&mdash;
&ldquo;Graustark,&rdquo; &ldquo;Stovepipe of Navarre,&rdquo;
 Even a &ldquo;Dorothy Vernon&rdquo;!


 Fate has still worse it can turn on&mdash;
 Lower you cannot descend;
 Even a &ldquo;Dorothy Vernon&rdquo;!&mdash;
 That is the limit&mdash;the end.

[Pg 16]
 Lower you cannot descend.
 Doomed to an end that is evil,
 That is the limit&mdash;the end!
 Pride of the forest primeval.




[Pg 17]
IN THE LAMPLIGHT



 The dinner done, the lamp is lit,
 And in its mellow glow we sit
 And talk of matters, grave and gay,
 That went to make another day.
 Comes Little One, a book in hand,
 With this request, nay, this command&mdash;
 (For who&#8217;d gainsay the little sprite)&mdash;
&ldquo;Please&mdash;will you read to me to-night?&rdquo;


 Read to you, Little One? Why, yes.
 What shall it be to-night? You guess
 You&#8217;d like to hear about the Bears&mdash;
 Their bowls of porridge, beds and chairs?
 Well, that you shall.... There! that tale&#8217;s done!
 And now&mdash;you&#8217;d like another one?
 To-morrow evening, Curly Head.
 It&#8217;s &ldquo;hass-pass seven.&rdquo; Off to bed!


 So each night another story:
 Wicked dwarfs and giants gory;
 Dragons fierce and princes daring,
 Forth to fame and fortune faring;
 Wandering tots, with leaves for bed;
 Houses made of gingerbread;
 Witches bad and fairies good,
 And all the wonders of the wood.


&ldquo;I like the witches best,&rdquo; says she
 Who nightly nestles on my knee;
[Pg 18]
 And why by them she sets such store,
 Psychologists may puzzle o&#8217;er.
 Her likes are mine, and I agree
 With all that she confides to me.
 And thus we travel, hand in hand,
 The storied roads of Fairyland.


 Ah, Little One, when years have fled,
 And left their silver on my head,
 And when the dimming eyes of age
 With difficulty scan the page,
 Perhaps I&#8217;ll turn the tables then;
 Perhaps I&#8217;ll put the question, when
 I borrow of your better sight&mdash;
&ldquo;Please&mdash;will you read to me to-night?&rdquo;




[Pg 19]
THE BREAKFAST FOOD FAMILY



 John Spratt will eat no fat,
   Nor will he touch the lean;
 He scorns to eat of any meat,
   He lives upon Foodine.


 But Mrs. Spratt will none of that,
   Foodine she cannot eat;
 Her special wish is for a dish
   Of Expurgated Wheat.


 To William Spratt that food is flat
   On which his mater dotes.
 His favorite feed&mdash;his special need&mdash;
   Is Eata Heapa Oats.


 But sister Lil can&#8217;t see how Will
   Can touch such tasteless food.
 As breakfast fare it can&#8217;t compare,
   She says, with Shredded Wood.


 Now, none of these Leander please,
   He feeds upon Bath Mitts.
 While sister Jane improves her brain
  With Cero-Grapo-Grits.


 Lycurgus votes for Father&#8217;s Oats;
   Proggine appeals to May;
 The junior John subsists upon
  Uneeda Bayla Hay.

[Pg 20]
 Corrected Wheat for little Pete;
   Flaked Pine for Dot; while &ldquo;Bub&rdquo;
 The infant Spratt is waxing fat
   On Battle Creek Near-Grub.




[Pg 21]
&ldquo;TREASURE ISLAND&rdquo;



 Comes little lady, a book in hand,
 A light in her eyes that I understand,
 And her cheeks aglow from the faery breeze
 That sweeps across the uncharted seas.
 She gives me the book, and her word of praise
 A ton of critical thought outweighs.
&ldquo;I&#8217;ve finished it, daddie!&rdquo;&mdash;a sigh thereat.
&ldquo;Are there any more books in the world like that?&rdquo;


 No, little lady. I grieve to say
 That of all the books in the world to-day
 There&#8217;s not another that&#8217;s quite the same
 As this magic book with the magic name.
 Volumes there be that are pure delight,
 Ancient and yellowed or new and bright;
 But&mdash;little and thin, or big and fat&mdash;
 There are no more books in the world like that.


 And what, little lady, would I not give
 For the wonderful world in which you live!
 What have I garnered one-half as true
 As the tales Titania whispers you?
 Ah, late we learn that the only truth
 Was that which we found in the Book of Youth.
 Profitless others, and stale, and flat;&mdash;
 There are no more books in the world like that.




[Pg 22]
A BALLADE OF SPRING&#8217;S UNREST



 Up in the woodland where Spring
 Comes as a laggard, the breeze
 Whispers the pines that the King,
 Fallen, has yielded the keys
 To his White Palace and flees
 Northward o&#8217;er mountain and dale.
 Speed then the hour that frees!
 Ho, for the pack and the trail!


 Northward my fancy takes wing,
 Restless am I, ill at ease.
 Pleasures the city can bring
 Lose now their power to please.
 Barren, all barren, are these,
 Town life&#8217;s a tedious tale;
 That cup is drained to the lees&mdash;
 Ho, for the pack and the trail!


 Ho, for the morning I sling
 Pack at my back, and with knees
 Brushing a thoroughfare, fling
 Into the green mysteries:
 One with the birds and the bees,
 One with the squirrel and quail,
 Night, and the stream&#8217;s melodies&mdash;
 Ho, for the pack and the trail!

&nbsp;
[Pg 23]
       L&#8217;Envoi


 Pictures and music and teas,
 Theaters&mdash;books even&mdash;stale.
 Ho, for the smell of the trees!
 Ho, for the pack and the trail!





[Pg 24]
WHY?



 Why, when the sun is gold,
  The weather fine,
 The air (this phrase is old)
   Like Gascon wine;&mdash;


 Why, when the leaves are red,
   And yellow, too,
 And when (as has been said)
   The skies are blue;&mdash;


 Why, when all things promote
   One&#8217;s peace and joy,&mdash;
 A joy that is (to quote)
   Without alloy;&mdash;


 Why, when a man&#8217;s well off,
   Happy and gay,
Why must he go play golf
   And spoil his day!





[Pg 25]
THE RIME OF THE CLARK STREET CABLE

(Now happily extinct.)



 Twas in a vault beneath the street,
   In the trench of the traction rope,
 That I found a guy with a fishy eye
   And a think tank filled with dope.


 His hair was matted, his face was black,
   And matted and black was he;
 And I heard this wight in the vault recite,
  &ldquo;In a singular minor key&rdquo;:


&ldquo;Oh, I am the guy with the fishy eye
   And the think tank filled with dope.
 My work is to watch the beautiful botch
   That&#8217;s known as the Clark Street Rope.


&ldquo;I pipes my eye as the rope goes by
   For every danger spot.
 If I spies one out I gives a shout,
   And we puts in another knot.


&ldquo;Them knots is all like brothers to me,
   And I loves &#8217;em, one and all.&rdquo;
 The muddy guy with the fishy eye
   A muddy tear let fall.


&ldquo;There goes a knot we tied last week,
   There&#8217;s one what we tied to-day;
 And there&#8217;s a patch was hard to reach,
   And caused six hours&#8217; delay.

[Pg 26]
&ldquo;Two hundred seventy-nine, all told,
   And I knows their history;
 And I&#8217;m most attached to a break we patched
   In the winter of &#8217;eighty-three.


&ldquo;For every time that knot comes round
   It sings out, &lsquo;Howdy, Bill!
 We&#8217;ll walk &#8217;em home to-night, old man,
   From here to the Ferris Wheel.


&ldquo;&lsquo;We&#8217;ll walk &#8217;em in the rush hours, Bill,
   A swearing company,
 As we&#8217;ve walked &#8217;em, Bill, since I was tied,
   In the winter of &#8217;eighty-three.&rsquo;&rdquo;


 The muddy guy with the fishy eye
   Let fall another tear.
&ldquo;Them knots is wife and child to me;
   I&#8217;ve known &#8217;em forty year.


&ldquo;For I am the guy with the fishy eye
   And the think tank filled with dope,
 Whose work is to watch the lovely botch
   That&#8217;s known as the Clark Street Rope.&rdquo;





[Pg 27]
MISS LEGION



 She is hotfoot after Cultyure,
 She pursues it with a club.
 She breathes a heavy atmosphere
 Of literary flub.
 No literary shrine so far
 But she is there to kneel;
         But&mdash;
 Her favorite line of reading
 Is O. Meredith&#8217;s &ldquo;Lucille.&rdquo;


 Of course she&#8217;s up on pictures&mdash;
 Passes for a connoisseur.
 On free days at the Institute
 You&#8217;ll always notice her.
 She qualifies approval
 Of a Titian or Corot;
         But&mdash;
 She throws a fit of rapture
 When she comes to Bouguereau.


 And when you talk of music,
 She is Music&#8217;s devotee.
 She will tell you that Beethoven
 Always makes her wish to pray;
 And &ldquo;dear old Bach!&rdquo; His very name
 She says, her ear enchants;
         But&mdash;
 Her favorite piece is Weber&#8217;s
&ldquo;Invitation to the Dance.&rdquo;





[Pg 28]
A BALLADE OF DEATH AND TIME



 I hold it truth with him who sweetly sings&mdash;
 The weekly music of the London Sphere&mdash;
 That deathless tomes the living present brings:
 Great literature is with us year on year.
 Books of the mighty dead, whom men revere,
 Remind me I can make my books sublime.
 But prithee, bay my brow while I am here:
 Why do we always wait for Death and Time?


 Shakespeare, great spirit, beat his mighty wings,
 As I beat mine, for the occasion near.
 He knew, as I, the worth of present things:
 Great literature is with us year on year.
 Methinks I meet across the gulf his clear
 And tranquil eye; his calm reflections chime
 With mine: &ldquo;Why do we at the present fleer?
 Why do we always wait for Death and Time?&rdquo;


 The reading world with acclamation rings
 For my last book. It led the list at Weir,
 Altoona, Rahway, Painted Post, Hot Springs:
 Great literature is with us year on year.
 The Bookman gives me a vociferous cheer.
 Howells approves! I can no higher climb.
 Bring then the laurel, crown my bright career.
 Why do we always wait for Death and Time?

&nbsp;
[Pg 29]
       L&#8217;Envoi


 Critics, who pastward, ever pastward peer,
 Great literature is with us year on year.
 Trumpet my fame while I am in my prime.
 Why do we always wait for Death and Time?





[Pg 30]
THE KAISER&#8217;S FAREWELL TO PRINCE HENRY



 Aufwiedersehen, brother mine!
   Farewells will soon be kissed;
 And ere you leave to breast the brine
   Give me once more your fist;


 That mail&eacute;d fist, clenched high in air
   On many a foreign shore,
 Enforcing coaling stations where
   No stations were before;


 That fist, which weaker nations view
   As if &#8217;twere Michael&#8217;s own,
 And which appals the heathen who
   Bow down to wood and stone.


 But this trip no brass knuckles. Glove
   That heavy mail&eacute;d hand;
 Your mission now is one of Love
   And Peace&mdash;you understand.


 All that&#8217;s American you&#8217;ll praise;
   The Yank can do no wrong.
 To use his own expressive phrase,
   Just &ldquo;jolly him along.&rdquo;


 Express surprise to find, the more
   Of Roosevelt you see,
 How much I am like Theodore,
   And Theodore like me.

[Pg 31]
 I am, in fact, (this might not be
   A bad thing to suggest,)
 The Theodore of the East, and he
   The William of the West.


 And, should you get a chance, find out&mdash;
   If anybody knows&mdash;
 Exactly what it&#8217;s all about,
   That Doctrine of Monroe&#8217;s.


 That&#8217;s entre nous. My present plan
   You know as well as I:
 Be just as Yankee as you can;
   If needs be, eat some pie.


 Cut out the &#8217;kraut, cut out Rhine wine,
   Cut out the Sch&uuml;tzenfest,
 The S&auml;ngerbund, the Turnverein,
   The Kommers, and the rest.


 And if some fool society
   &ldquo;Die Wacht am Rhein&rdquo; should sing,
You sing &ldquo;My Country, &#8217;Tis of Thee&rdquo;&mdash;
   The tune&#8217;s &ldquo;God Save the King.&rdquo;


 To our own kindred in that land
   There&#8217;s not much you need tell.
 Just tell them that you saw me, and
   That I was looking well.





[Pg 32]
TO LILLIAN RUSSELL

(A reminiscence of 18&mdash;.)



 Dear Lillian! (The &ldquo;dear&rdquo; one risks;
&ldquo;Miss Russell&rdquo; were a bit austerer)&mdash;
 Do you remember Mr. Fiske&#8217;s
    Dramatic Mirror


 Back when&mdash;? (But we&#8217;ll not count the years;
 The way they&#8217;ve sped is most surprising.)
 You were a trifle in arrears
     For advertising.


 I brought the bill to your address;
 I was the Mirror&#8217;s bill collector&mdash;
 In Thespian haunts a more or less
     Familiar spectre.


 On that (to me) momentous day
 You dwelt amid the city&#8217;s clatter,
 A few doors west of old Broadway;
     The street&mdash;no matter.


 But while you have forgot the debt,
 And him who called in line of duty,
 He never, never shall forget
     Your wondrous beauty.


 You were too fair for mortal speech,&mdash;
 Enchanting, positively rippin&#8217;;
 You were some dream, and quelque peach,
     And beaucoup pippin.

[Pg 33]
 Your &ldquo;fight with Time&rdquo; had not begun,
 Nor any reason to promote it;
 No beauty battles to be won.
     Beauty? You wrote it!


&ldquo;A bill?&rdquo; you murmured in distress,
&ldquo;A bill?&rdquo; (I still can hear you say it.)
&ldquo;A bill from Mr. Fiske? Oh, yes ...
     I&#8217;ll call and pay it.&rdquo;


 And he, the thrice-requited kid,
 That such a goddess should address him,
 Could only blush and paw his lid,
     And stammer, &ldquo;Yes&#8217;m!&rdquo;


 Eheu! It seems a cycle since,
 But still the nerve of memory tingles.
 And here you&#8217;re writing Beauty Hints,
     And I these jingles.





[Pg 34]
DORNR&Ouml;SCHEN



 In the great hall of Castle Innocence,
 Hedged round with thorns of maiden doubts and fears,&mdash;
 Within, without, a silence grave, intense,&mdash;
 Her soul lies sleeping through the rose-leaf years.


 Hedged round with thorns of maiden doubts and fears;
 And all save one the thither path shall miss.
 Her soul lies sleeping through the rose-leaf years,
 Waiting the Prince and his awakening kiss.


 And all save one the thither path shall miss;
 For one alone may thread the thorn defence.
 Waiting the Prince and his awakening kiss,
 A hush broods over Castle Innocence.


 For one alone may thread the thorn defence,
 Care free, heart free, and singing on his way.
 A hush broods over Castle Innocence
 One comes to wake;&mdash;but when&mdash;ah, who can say!


 Care free, heart free, and singing on his way,
 One comes all thorns of Fear and Doubt to dare.
 One comes to wake! But when? Ah, who can say
 The hour his light feet press the castle stair?

[Pg 35]
 One comes all thorns of Fear and Doubt to dare!
 Thorns with his coming into roses bloom.
 The hour his light feet press the castle stair
 The warders of the castle hall give room.


 Thorns with his coming into roses bloom;
 For him the flowers of Trust and Faith unfold.
 The warders of the castle hall give room
 Before the young Prince of the Heart of Gold.


 For him the flowers of Trust and Faith unfold;
 Till then the thorns of maiden doubts and fears.
 Before the young Prince of the Heart of Gold
 Her rose-soul slumbers through the tranquil years.


 Till then the thorns of maiden doubts and fears.
 Within, without, a silence grave, intense.
 Her rose-soul slumbers through the tranquil years
 In the great hall of Castle Innocence.





[Pg 36]
&ldquo;FAREWELL!&rdquo;

(Evoked by Calverley&#8217;s &ldquo;Forever.&rdquo;)



&ldquo;Farewell!&rdquo; Another gloomy word
 As ever into language crept.
&#8217;Tis often written, never heard
      Except


 In playhouse. Ere the hero flits
 (In handcuffs) from our pitying view,
&ldquo;Farewell!&rdquo; he murmurs, then exits
      R. U.


&ldquo;Farewell!&rdquo; is much too sighful for
 An age that has not time to sigh.
 We say, &ldquo;I&#8217;ll see you later,&rdquo; or
     &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo;


&ldquo;Fare well&rdquo; meant long ago, before
 It crept tear-spattered into song,
&ldquo;Safe voyage!&rdquo; &ldquo;Pleasant journey!&rdquo; or
     &ldquo;So long!&rdquo;


 But gone its cheery, old-time ring:
 The poets made it rime with knell.
 Joined, it became a dismal thing&mdash;
     &ldquo;Farewell!&rdquo;


&ldquo;Farewell!&rdquo; Into the lover&#8217;s soul
 You see fate plunge the cruel iron.
 All poets use it. It&#8217;s the whole
      Of Byron.

[Pg 37]
&ldquo;I only feel&mdash;farewell!&rdquo; said he;
 And always tearful was the telling.
 Lord Byron was eternally
      Farewelling.


&ldquo;Farewell!&rdquo; A dismal word, &#8217;tis true.
 (And why not tell the truth about it?)
 But what on earth would poets do
      Without it!





[Pg 38]
REFORM IN OUR TOWN



 There was a man in Our Town
   And Jimson was his name,
 Who cried, &ldquo;Our civic government
   Is honeycombed with shame.&rdquo;
 He called us neighbors in and said,
  &ldquo;By Graft we&#8217;re overrun.
 Let&#8217;s have a general cleaning up,
   As other towns have done.&rdquo;


 The citizens of Our Town
   Responded to the call;
 Beneath the banner of Reform
   We gathered one and all.
 We sent away for men expert
   In hunting civic sin,
 To ask these practised gentlemen
   Just how we should begin.


 The experts came to Our Town
   And told us how &#8217;twas done.
&ldquo;Begin with Gas and Traction,
   And half your fight is won.
 Begin with Gas and Traction;
   The rest will follow soon.&rdquo;
 We looked at one another
   And hummed a different tune.

[Pg 39]
 Said Smith, &ldquo;Saloons in Our Town
   Are palaces of shame.&rdquo;
 Said Jones, &ldquo;Police corruption
   Has hurt the town&#8217;s fair name.&rdquo;
 Said Brown, &ldquo;Our lawless children
   Pitch pennies as they please.&rdquo;
 Now would it not be wiser
   To start Reform with these?


 The men who came to Our Town
   Replied, &ldquo;No haste with these;
 Begin with Gas&mdash;or Water&mdash;
   The roots of the disease.&rdquo;
 We looked at one another
   And hemmed and hawed a bit;
 Enthusiasm faded then
   From every single cit.


 The men who came to Our Town
   Expressed a mild surprise,
 Then they too at each other
   Looked &ldquo;with a wild surmise.&rdquo;
 Jimson had stock in Traction,
   And Jones had stock in Gas,
 And Smith and Brown in this and that,
   So&mdash;nothing came to pass.

[Pg 40]
 The profligates of Our Town
   Pitch pennies as of yore;
 Police corruption flourishes
   As rankly as before,
 Still are our gilded ginmills
   Foul palaces of shame.
 Reform is just as distant
   As when the wise men came.





[Pg 41]
WHEN THE SIRUP&#8217;S ON THE FLAPJACK



 When the sirup&#8217;s on the flapjack and the coffee&#8217;s in the pot;
 When the fly is in the butter&mdash;where he&#8217;d rather be than not;
 When the cloth is on the table, and the plates are on the cloth;
 When the salt is in the shaker and the chicken&#8217;s in the broth;
 When the cream is in the pitcher and the pitcher&#8217;s on the tray,
 And the tray is on the sideboard when it isn&#8217;t on the way;
 When the rind is on the bacon and likewise upon the cheese,
 Then I somehow feel inspired to do a string of rimes like these.




[Pg 42]
BREAD PUDDYNGE



 When good King Arthur ruled our land
   He was a goodly king,
 And his idea of what to eat
   Was a good bag puddynge.


 The bag puddynge he had in mind
   Was thickly strewn with plums,
 With alternating lumps of fat
   As big as my two thumbs.


&ldquo;My love,&rdquo; quoth he to Guinevere,
  &ldquo;We have a joust to-day&mdash;
 Sir Launce is here, Sir Tris, Sir Gal,
   And all the brave array.


&ldquo;Put everything across to-night
   In guise of goodly fare,
 And cook us up a bag puddynge
   That will y-curl our hair.&rdquo;


&ldquo;I&#8217;ll curl your hair,&rdquo; said Guinevere,
  &ldquo;As tight as tight can be;
 I&#8217;ll cook you up a bag puddynge
   From my new recipee.&rdquo;




&ldquo;Pitch in and eat, my merry men!&rdquo;
   That night the King did say;
&ldquo;But save a little room&mdash;a bag
   Puddynge is on the way.

[Pg 43]
&ldquo;Ho! here it comes! Now, by my sword,
   A famous feast &#8217;twill be.
 Queen Guinevere hath cooked it, Launce,
   From her own recipee.&rdquo;


&ldquo;Odslife!&rdquo; cried Launce, &ldquo;if there is aught
   I love &#8217;tis this same thing.&rdquo;
 And he and all the knights did fall
   Upon that bag puddynge.


 One taste, and every holy knight
   Sat speechless for a space,
 While disappointment and disgust
   Were writ in every face.


&ldquo;Odsbodikins!&rdquo; Sir Tristram cried,
  &ldquo;In all my days, by Jing!
 I ne&#8217;er did taste so flat a mess
   As this here bag puddynge.&rdquo;


&ldquo;Odswhiskers, Arthur!&rdquo; cried Sir Launce,
   Whose license knew no bounds,
&ldquo;I would to Godde I had this stuff
   To poultice up my wounds.&rdquo;


 King Arthur spat his mouthful out,
   And sent for Guinevere.
&ldquo;What is this frightful mess?&rdquo; he roared.
  &ldquo;Is this a joke, my dear?&rdquo;

[Pg 44]
&ldquo;Oh, ain&#8217;t it good?&rdquo; asked Guinevere,
   Her face a rosy red.
&ldquo;I thought &#8217;twould make an awful hit:
  I made it out of bread!&rdquo;




 When good King Arthur ruled our land
   He was a goodly king,
 And only once in all his reign
   Was made a Bread Puddynge.





[Pg 45]
MUSCA DOMESTICA



 Baby bye, here&#8217;s a fly,
 We will watch him, you and I;
 Lest he fall in Baby&#8217;s mouth,
 Bringing germs from north and south.
 In the world of things a-wing
 There is not a nastier thing
 Than this pesky little fly;&mdash;
 So we&#8217;ll watch him, you and I.


 See him crawl up the wall,
 And he&#8217;ll never, never fall;
 Save that, poisoned, he may drop
 In the soup or on the chop.
 Let us coax the cunning brute
 To the tempting Tanglefoot,
 Or invite his thirsty soul
 To the poison-paper bowl.


 I believe with six such legs
 You or I could walk on eggs;
 But he&#8217;d rather crawl on meat
 With his microbe-laden feet.
 Eggs would hardly do as well&mdash;
 He could not get through the shell;
 Better far, to spread disease,
 Vegetables, meat, or cheese.

[Pg 46]
 There he goes, on his toes,
 Tickling, tickling Baby&#8217;s nose.
 Heaven knows where he has been,
 And what filth he&#8217;s wallowed in.
 Drat the nasty little wretch!
 He&#8217;s the deuce and all to ketch.
 Ah! He&#8217;s settled on the wall.
 Now the thunderbolt shall fall!


 Baby bye, see that fly?
 We will swat him, you and I.





[Pg 47]
THE PASSIONATE PROFESSOR


&ldquo;But bending low, I whisper only this:
 &lsquo;Love, it is night.&rsquo;&rdquo;
&mdash;Harry Thurston Peck.



 Love, it is night. The orb of day
 Has gone to hit the cosmic hay.
   Nocturnal voices now we hear.
   Come, heart&#8217;s delight, the hour is near
 When Passion&#8217;s mandate we obey.


 I would not, sweet, the fact convey
 In any crude and obvious way:
   I merely whisper in your ear&mdash;
                  &ldquo;Love, it is night!&rdquo;


 Candor compels me, pet, to say
 That years my fading charms betray.
   Tho&#8217; Love be blind, I grant it&#8217;s clear
   I&#8217;m no Apollo Belvedere.
 But after dark all cats are gray.
                   Love, it is night!





[Pg 48]
A BALLADE OF WOOL-GATHERING



 Now is my season of unrest,
 Now calls the forest, day and night;
 And by its pleasant spell obsessed,
 My wits go soaring like a kite.
 Forgive me if I be not bright,
 And pardon if I seem distrait;
 Wood-fancies put my wits to flight;&mdash;
 The woods are but a week away.


 Palleth upon my soul the jest,
 Falleth upon my pen a blight.
 The daily task has lost its zest,
 And everything is flat and trite.
 There&#8217;s nothing humorous in sight;
 Don&#8217;t mind if I am dull to-day.
 For every column is a fight
 When woods are but a week away.


 Woods in the robes of summer dressed&mdash;
 In greens and grays and browns bedight!
 A journey on a river&#8217;s breast,
 Beneath the wedded blue-and-white!...
 This end the Voyage of Delight
 Waits, in a little wood-bound bay,
 A bark canoe, all trim and tight;&mdash;
 The woods are but a week away!

&nbsp;
[Pg 49]
       L&#8217;Envoi


 Dear Reader, there is much to write;
 I&#8217;ve many weighty things to say.
 But who can write when woods invite,
 And woods are but a week away!





[Pg 50]
TO THE SUN

(Variations on a theme by Gilbert.)



 Shine on, Old Top, shine on!
 Across the realms of space
     Shine on!
 What though I&#8217;m in a sorry case?
 What though my collar is a wreck,
 And hangs a rag about my neck?
 What though at food I can but peck?
   Never you mind!
     Shine on!


 Shine on, Old Top, shine on!
 Through leagues of lifeless air
     Shine on!
 It&#8217;s true I&#8217;ve no more shirts to wear,
 My underwear is soaked, &#8217;tis true,
 My gullet is a redhot flue&mdash;
 But don&#8217;t let that unsettle you!
   Never you mind!
     Shine on! [It shines on.]





[Pg 51]
WHEN IT IS HOT

&ldquo;And Nebuchadnezzar commanded the most mighty men
that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego,
and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.&rdquo;



 Consider Mr. Shadrach,
   Of fiery furnace fame:
 He didn&#8217;t bleat about the heat
   Or fuss about the flame.
 He didn&#8217;t stew and worry,
   And get his nerves in kinks,
 Nor fill his skin with limes and gin
   And other &ldquo;cooling drinks.&rdquo;


 Consider Mr. Meshach,
   Who felt the furnace too:
 He let it sizz nor queried &ldquo;Is
   It hot enough for you?&rdquo;
 He didn&#8217;t mop his forehead,
   And hunt a shady spot;
 Nor did he say, &ldquo;Gee! what a day!
   Believe me, it&#8217;s some hot.&rdquo;


 Consider, too, Abed-nego,
   Who shared his comrades&#8217; plight:
 He didn&#8217;t shake his coat and make
   Himself a holy sight.
 He didn&#8217;t wear suspenders
   Without a coat and vest;
 Nor did he scowl and snort and howl,
   And make himself a pest.

[Pg 52]
 Consider, friends, this trio&mdash;
   How little fuss they made.
 They didn&#8217;t curse when it was worse
   Than ninety in the shade.
 They moved about serenely
   Within the furnace bright,
 And soon forgot that it was hot,
   With &ldquo;no relief in sight.&rdquo;





[Pg 53]
THE SIMPLE, HEARTFELT LAY



 Lives of poets oft remind us
   Not to wait too long for Time,
 But, departing, leave behind us
   Obvious facts embalmed in rime.


 Poems that we have to ponder
   Turn us prematurely gray;
 We are infinitely fonder
   Of the simple, heartfelt lay.


 Whitman&#8217;s Leaves of Grass is odious,
   Browning&#8217;s Ring and Book a bore.
 Bleat, O bards, in lines melodious,&mdash;
   Bleat that two and two is four!


 Must we hunt for hidden treasures?
   Nay! We want the heartfelt straight.
 Minstrel, sing, in obvious measures&mdash;
   Sing that four and four is eight!


 Whitman leads to easy slumbers,
   Browning makes us hunt the hay.
 Pipe, ye potes, in simplest numbers,
  Anything ye have to say.

A NOTE FROM MR. FLACCUS

(Concerning the verses that follow.)


Dear B. L. T.:

You know my &ldquo;pomes.&rdquo; Well, old man, I
was pretty young when I got them out of my system,
and they seem rather raw to me now&mdash;I&#8217;m
getting along, you know; so I&#8217;ve been thinking
that I&#8217;d do &#8217;em over again, file &#8217;em down, as we
used to say. Enclosed is the result of my labors.

I presume you are wondering why I have
done them into United States; but you know perfectly
well that a poet as much alive as I am to-day
must not only keep up with the procession, but
choose a thought-vehicle that has good springs
to it&mdash;&ldquo;beaucoup resiliency,&rdquo; I s&#8217;pose you&#8217;d call it.

I hope you will like these new lines of mine
better than their prototypes.

Yours regardfully,
Q. H. F.
Helngon, November 15.

TO ARISTIUS FUSCUS

&ldquo;Integer vit&aelig; scelerisque purus.&rdquo;



 Fuscus, old scout, if a guy&#8217;s on the level
   That&#8217;s all the arsenal he&#8217;ll have to tote;
 Up to St. Peter or down to the Devil,
   No need to carry a gun in his coat.


 Prowling around, as you know is my habit,
   I met a wolf in the forest, and he
 Beat it for Wolfville and ran like a rabbit.
   (He was some wolf, too, receive it from me.)


 Where I may happen to camp is no matter,&mdash;
   Paris, Chicago, Ostend or St. Joe,&mdash;
 Like the old dame in the nursery patter
   I shall make music wherever I go.


 Drop me in Dawson or chuck me in Cadiz,
   Dump me in Kansas or plant me in Rome,&mdash;
 I shall keep on making love to the ladies:
   Where there&#8217;s a skirt is my notion of home.

DUETTO

&ldquo;Donec gratus eram.&rdquo;



             HORACE:
 What time my Lydia owned me lord
   No Persian king had much on Horace;
 And when you blew my bed and board
   I was some sad, believe me, Mawruss.


             LYDIA:
 What time you loved no other She,
   Before this Chlo&euml; person signed you,
 I flourished like a green bay tree;
   Now I&#8217;m the Girl You Left Behind You.


             HORACE:
 This Chlo&euml; dame that takes my eye
   Has so peculiar an allurance
 I would not hesitate to die
   If she could cop my life insurance.


             LYDIA:
 Well, as for that, I know a gent
   With whom it&#8217;s some delight to dally.
 With me he makes an awful dent;
   I&#8217;d perish once or twice for Cally.


             HORACE:
 Suppose our former love should go
   Into a new de luxe edition?
 Suppose I tie a can to Chlo,
   And let you play your old position?

[Pg 58]
             LYDIA:
 Why, then, you cork, you butterfly,
   You sweet, philandering, perjured villain,
 With you I&#8217;d love to live and die,
   Tho&#8217; Cally boy were twice as killin&#8217;.

TO PYRRHA

&ldquo;Quis multa gracilis.&rdquo;



 What young tin whistle gent,
 Bedaubed with barber&#8217;s scent,&mdash;
   What cheapskate waits on you
   To woo,
         O Pyrrha?


 For whom the puff and rat
 And transformation that
   You bought a year ago
   Or so,
         O Pyrrha?


 Peeved? Not a bit. Not I
 I&#8217;m sorry for the guy.
   He draws a lovely lime
   This time,
         O Pyrrha!


 I&#8217;ve dipped. The wet ain&#8217;t fine.
 Hung on the votive line
   My duds. The gods can see
   I&#8217;m free.
         Eh, Pyrrha!

TO ARISTIUS FUSCUS

&ldquo;My sweetly-smiling, sweetly-speaking Lalage.&rdquo;



 Fuscus, take a tip from me:
   This here job&#8217;s no bed of roses,
 Not the cinch it seems to be,
   Not the pipe that one supposes.
       What care I, tho&#8217;, if I may
       Lallygag with Lalage.


 Every day there&#8217;s ink to spill,
   Tho&#8217; I may not feel like working.
 Every day a hole to fill;
   One must plug it&mdash;there&#8217;s no shirking.
       Oh, that I might all the day
       Lallygag with Lalage!


 People say, &ldquo;Gee! what a snap,
   Turning paragraphs and verses.
 He&#8217;s the band on Fortune&#8217;s cap,
   Gets a barrel of ses-terces.&rdquo;
       Let them gossip, while I play
       Hide and seek with Lalage.


 People hand me out advice:
  &ldquo;Hod, you&#8217;re doing too much drivel.
 Write us something sweet and nice.
   Stow the satire, chop the frivol.&rdquo;
       But we have the rent to pay,
       Lalage; eh, Lalage?

[Pg 61]
 Ladies shy the saving sense
   Write me patronizing letters;
 And there are the writing gents,
   Always out to knock their betters.
       What cares Flaccus if he may
       Lallygag with Lalage!


 No, old top, the writing lay&#8217;s
   Not a bed of sweet geranium.
 Brickbats mingle with bouquets
   Shied at my devoted cranium.
       Does it peeve yours truly? Nay.
       Nothing can&mdash;with Lalage.


 Paste this, Fuscus, in your hat:
   Not a pesky thing can peeve me.
 Take it, too, from Horace flat,
   She&#8217;s some gal, is Lal, believe me.
       So I coin this word to-day,
      &ldquo;Lallygag&rdquo;&mdash;from Lalage.

TO SYLVIA



 Were I on the Latin lay,
 Were I turning Odes to-day,
 You would draw a gem from me,
 Little maid of mystery!


 In an Ode I&#8217;d love to spout you;
 I am simply bug about you.
 That&#8217;s the way!&mdash;the fairest peach
 Is the one that&#8217;s out of reach.


 I have toasted in my time
 Many a peach (and many a lime),
 All of them, I must confess,
 Lacking your elusiveness.


 Lalage, my well known flame,
 Was considerable dame;
 Likewise Lydia and Phyllis,
 Chlo&euml;, Pyrrha, Amaryllis.


 Syl, if you had lived when they did
 You&#8217;d have had those damsels faded.
 (That will give you, girl, some notion
 Of your Flaccus&#8217;s devotion.)


 Yep. If I were doing Odes
 In my quondam favorite modes,
 With your image to qui-vive me
 I&#8217;d tear off some Ode, believe me!





[Pg 63]
A BALLAD OF MISFITS


&ldquo;Chacun son m&eacute;tier:
 Les vaches seront bien gard&eacute;es.&rdquo;
              &mdash;La Fontaine.



 With skill for doing this or that
   The Lord each man endows.
 Some men are best for pushing pens,
   And some for pushing plows;
 And oh, the many many more
   That should be tending cows!
    Chacun son m&eacute;tier:
    Les vaches bien gard&eacute;es.


 The ivory-headed serving maid
   Who poses as a &ldquo;cook,&rdquo;
 She hath a very bovine brain,
   She hath a bovine look.
 Oh, prithee, lead her to the kine,
   Oh, prithee get the hook!
    Chacun son m&eacute;tier:
    Les vaches bien gard&eacute;es.


 The papering-and-painting gents
   Whose work is never done,
 Who mess around your house until
   You pine to pull a gun,
 Who take three mortal days to do
   What should be done in one;&mdash;
    Chacun son m&eacute;tier:
    Les vaches bien gard&eacute;es.

[Pg 64]
 The pestilential &ldquo;pianiste,&rdquo;
   The screechy singer too,
 The writer of the stupid book
   And of the dull review,
 The actor who is greatest when
   He takes his exit cue;&mdash;
    Chacun son m&eacute;tier:
    Les vaches bien gard&eacute;es.


 If every one were set to do
   The task for which he&#8217;s fit,
 The writer of these trifling lines
   Might also have to quit.
 At tending cows the undersigned
   Might make an awful hit.
    Chacun son m&eacute;tier:
    Les vaches bien gard&eacute;es.

AN ORIENTAL APOLOGY



 When the hour was come Prince Chun arose,
 And balanced a shoestring on his nose.
&ldquo;From this some notion you will get,&rdquo;
 Said he, &ldquo;of China&#8217;s deep regret.&rdquo;


 Now balancing upon his ear
 A stein of foaming lager beer,
&ldquo;This attitude,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;reveals
 How very sorry China feels.&rdquo;


 Then spinning top-like on his cue,
&ldquo;I can&#8217;t begin to tell to you
 The deep remorse we suffer for
 The death of your Ambassador.&rdquo;


 Next, placing on his cue a plate,
 He said, as it &#8217;gan to gyrate:
&ldquo;Nothing that&#8217;s happened in his reign
 Has caused my Emperor so much pain.&rdquo;


 Upon his back he did declare,
 While juggling five balls in the air,
&ldquo;This attitude&mdash;the humblest yet&mdash;
 Expresses personal regret.&rdquo;


 Last, spreading out a deck of cards&mdash;
&ldquo;Accept my Emperor&#8217;s regards.
 As our intentions were well meant,
 Pray overlook the incident.&rdquo;





[Pg 66]
THE DAY OF THE COMET

(May 18, 1910.)



 Here it is&mdash;Eighteenth of May!
 Dawneth now the fatal day
 When we take the awful veil
 Of the fearsome comet&#8217;s tail.
        Vale, Earth!


 What will happen, heaven knows;
 We can&#8217;t even guess, suppose,
 Hazard, speculate, surmise,
 Hint, conjecture, theorize,
        Or divine.


 Will we merely drill a hole
 Through the trailing aureole?
 Or will the prediction dire
 Of a world destroyed by fire
        Be fulfilled?


 Shall we crook our knees and pray
 Counting this the Judgment Day?
 Or preserve a cosmic ca&#8217;m,
 Caring not a cosmic dam
        What may come?


 There&#8217;s the rub. If we but knew
 We should know just what to do.
 Yes is just as good as No

THE MORNING AFTER

(May 19, 1910.)



 Here we are, friends, whole and hale
 In or through the comet&#8217;s tail;
 And as far as we can say,
 Matters are about as they
        Were before.


 Everything is much the same
 As before the comet came.
 Grasses grow and waters run&mdash;
 Nothing new beneath the sun&mdash;
        Same old sphere.


 Life is drab or life is gay,
 Thorny path or primrose way;
 All is common, all is strange;
&ldquo;Down the ringing grooves of change&rdquo;
        Spins the world.


 Change but of a humdrum kind.
 What we vaguely had in mind
 Was some new sensation or
 Thrill we never felt before.
        Vain desire!


 Nothing&#8217;s added to the stock:
 Same old shiver, same old shock.
 Round about the sun we&#8217;ll go
 In the same old status quo.
        Awful bore!

A BALLADE OF IRRESOLUTION



 Isolde, in the story old,
 When Ireland&#8217;s coast the vessel nears,
 And Death were fairer to behold,
 To Tristan gives &ldquo;the cup that clears.&rdquo;
 Straight to their fate the helmsman steers:
 Unknowing, each the potion sips....
 Comes echoing through the ghostly years
&ldquo;Give me the philtre of thy lips!&rdquo;


 Ah, that like Tristan I were bold!
 My soul into the future peers,
 And passion flags, and heart grows cold,
 And sicklied resolution veers.
 I see the Sister of the Shears
 Who sits fore&#8217;er and snips, and snips....
 Still falls upon my inward ears,
&ldquo;Give me the philtre of thy lips!&rdquo;


 Hero of lovers, largely soul&#8217;d!
 Imagination thee enspheres
 With song-enchanted wood and wold
 And casements fronting magic meres.
 Tristan, thy large example cheers
 The faint of heart; thy story grips!&mdash;
 My soul again that echo hears,
&ldquo;Give me the philtre of thy lips!&rdquo;

       L&#8217;Envoi


 Sweet sorceress, resolve my fears!
 He stakes all who Elysium clips.
 What tho&#8217; the fruit be tares and tears!&mdash;
 Give me the philtre of thy lips!

&ldquo;Mrs. O&mdash;&mdash; now takes her daily dip at 5 in the afternoon,

 This is the forest primeval.


 This the spruce with the glorious plume
 That grew in the forest primeval.


 This is the lumberman big and browned
 Who felled the spruce tree to the ground
 That grew in the forest primeval.


 This is the man with the paper mill
 Who bought the pulp that paid the bill
 Of the husky lumberjack who chopped
 The lofty spruce and its branches lopped
 That grew in the forest primeval.


 This is the publisher bland and rich
 Who bought the roll of paper which
 Was made by the man with the paper mill
 Who bought the pulp that paid the bill
 Of the lumberjack with the murderous ax
 Who felled the spruce with lusty hacks
 That grew in the forest primeval.


 This is the youth with the writing tool
 Who does the daily Newport drool
 That helps to make the publisher rich
 Who ordered the stock of paper which[Pg 71]
 Was made by the man with the paper mill
 Who bought the pulp that paid the bill
 Of the husky Swede in the Joseph&#8217;s coat
 Who swung his ax and the tall spruce smote
 That grew in the forest primeval.


 This is the lady far from slim
 Who changed the hour of her daily swim
 And excited the youth with the writing tool
 Who does the Newport drivel and drool
 For the prosperous publisher bland and fat
 Who ordered the virgin paper that
 Was made by the man with the paper mill
 Who bought the pulp that paid the bill
 Of Ole Oleson the husky Swede
 Who did a foul and darksome deed
 When he swung his ax with vigor and vim
 And smote the spruce tree tall and trim
 That grew in the forest primeval.


 This is the shop girl Mag or Liz
 Who daily devours what news there is
 Concerning the lady far from slim
 Who changed the time of her ocean swim
 And excited the youth with the writing tool
 Who does the daily Newport drool
 For the pursy publisher bland and rich
 Who bought the innocent paper which
 Was made by the man with the paper mill
 Who bought the pulp that paid the bill[Pg 72]
 Of the Swedish jack who slew the spruce
 That came to a most ignoble use&mdash;
 The lofty spruce with the glorious plume&mdash;
 The giant spruce that used to loom
 In the heart of the forest primeval.

HOW THEY MIGHT HAVE BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS



 We sprang to the motor, I, Joris and Dirck.
 I snapped on my goggles and got to my work.
&ldquo;Hi, there!&rdquo; yelled the cop in the helmet of white;
&ldquo;Let her flicker!&rdquo; said Joris, and into the night,
 With a sneer at the speed laws, we hurtled hell-bent
 To carry to Aix the good tidings from Ghent.


 The going was poor, we expected delay,
 And the usual livestock obstructed the way.
 At Boom we ran over a large yellow dog,
 At D&uuml;ffeld a chicken, at Mecheln a hog;
 What else, we&#8217;d no time to slow down to inquire;
 At Aerschot, confound it! we blew out a tire.


 I jacked up the axle and ripped off the shoe,
 And snapped on an extra that promised to do.
&ldquo;All aboard!&rdquo; I exclaimed as I cranked the machine,
 But something was wrong with the curst gasoline.
&ldquo;By Hasselt!&rdquo; Dirck groaned, &ldquo;We&#8217;ll be half a day late;
 We ought to have sent the good tidings by freight.&rdquo;


 False prophet! I tinkered a minute or two
 And again we were off like &ldquo;a bolt from the blue.&rdquo;[Pg 74]
 We ate up the hills at a forty-mile clip,
 And skidded the turns like the snap of a whip,
 Till we dashed into Aix and were pinched by a cop
 For failing to slow when commanded to stop.


&ldquo;Now, wouldn&#8217;t that frost you!&rdquo; said Joris, but we
 When we told the glad tidings were instantly free.
 The Mayor himself paid the ten dollars&#8217; fine,
 And blew us to dinner with six kinds of wine,
 Which (the burgesses voted, by common consent)
 Was no more than their due that brought good news from Ghent.

THE DINOSAUR



 Behold the mighty Dinosaur,
 Famous in prehistoric lore,
 Not only for his weight and strength
 But for his intellectual length.
 You will observe by these remains
 The creature had two sets of brains&mdash;
 One in his head (the usual place),
 The other at his spinal base.
 Thus he could reason a priori
 As well as a posteriori.
 No problem bothered him a bit;
 He made both head and tail of it.
 So wise he was, so wise and solemn,
 Each thought filled just a spinal column.
 If one brain found the pressure strong
 It passed a few ideas along;
 If something slipped his forward mind
 &#8217;Twas rescued by the one behind;
 And if in error he was caught
 He had a saving afterthought.
 As he thought twice before he spoke
 He had no judgments to revoke;
 For he could think, without congestion,
 Upon both sides of every question.


 Oh, gaze upon this model beast,
 Defunct ten million years at least.





[Pg 76]
A BALLADE OF CAP AND BELLS



 When as a dewdrop joy enspheres
 This pleasant planet, arched with blue,
 When every prospect charms and cheers,
 And all the world is fair to view&mdash;
 Who does not envy (have not you?)
 That mortal, by Thalia kissed,
 Who plies, in plumes of cockatoo,
 The blithesome trade of humorist?


 But when the wind of fortune veers,
 And blue-white skies turn leaden hue,
 When every pleasant prospect blears
 And all the weary world&#8217;s askew&mdash;
 Who then would envy (if he knew)
 Jack Point the jester, glum and trist;
 Or ply, tho&#8217; first of all the crew,
 The dismal trade of humorist?


 Ah, jocund trifles writ in tears,
 And merry stanzas steeped in rue!
 When all the world in drab appears
 The fool must still in motley woo.
 Tho&#8217; bitter be the cud he chew,
 Still must he grind his foolish grist;
 Still must he ply, the long day through,
 The tragic trade of humorist!

 The heart and soul of him may twist
 Who doth in cap and bells pursue

GENTLE DOCTOR BROWN



 It was a gentle sawbones and his name was Doctor Brown.
 His auto was the terror of a small suburban town.
 His practice, quite amazing for so trivial a place,
 Consisted of the victims of his homicidal pace.


 So constant was his practice and so high his motor&#8217;s gear
 That at knocking down pedestrians he never had a peer;
 But it must, in simple justice, be as truly written down
 That no man could be more thoughtful than gentle Doctor Brown.


 Whatever was the errand on which Doctor Brown was bent
 He&#8217;d stop to patch a victim up and never charged a cent.
 He&#8217;d always pause, whoever &#8217;twas he happened to run down:
 A humane and a thoughtful man was gentle Doctor Brown.


&ldquo;How fortunate,&rdquo; he would observe, &ldquo;how fortunate &#8217;twas I
 That knocked you galley-west and heard your wild and wailing cry.[Pg 79]
 There are some heartless wretches who would leave you here alone,
 Without a sympathetic ear to catch your dying moan.


&ldquo;Such callousness,&rdquo; said Doctor Brown, &ldquo;I cannot comprehend;
 To fathom such indifference I simply don&#8217;t pretend.
 One ought to do his duty, and I never am remiss.
 A simple word of thanks is all I ask. Here, swallow this!&rdquo;


 Then, reaching in the tonneau, he&#8217;d unpack his little kit,
 And perform an operation that was workmanlike and fit.
&ldquo;You may survive,&rdquo; said Doctor Brown; &ldquo;it&#8217;s happened once or twice.
 If not, you&#8217;ve had the benefit of competent advice.&rdquo;


 Oh, if all our motormaniacs were equally humane,
 How little bitterness there&#8217;d be, or reason to complain!
 How different our point of view if we were ridden down
 By lunatics as thoughtful as gentle Doctor Brown!

IN THE GALLERY



 Weirder than the pictures
 Are the folks who come
 With their owlish strictures&mdash;
 Telling why they&#8217;re bum.
 Of all lines of babble
 This one has the call:
 Picture gallery gabble
 Is the best of all.


 Literary fluffle
 Never, never cloys;
 Much has Mrs. Guffle
 Added to my joys.
 For that chitter-chatter
 I delight to fall.
 But the picture patter
 Is the best of all.


 With the music highbrows
 I delight to chat,
 Elevating my brows
 Over this and that.
 Music tittle-tattle
 Never fails to thrall.
 But the picture prattle
 Is the best of all.


 Sociologic rub-dub
 I delight to hear;[Pg 81]
 Philosophic flub-dub
 Titillates my ear.
 Lovelier yet the spiffle
 In the picture hall;
 For the picture piffle
 Is the best of all.


 Weirder than the pictures
 Are the folks who stand
 Passing owlish strictures,
 Catalogue in hand.
 Hear the bunk they babble
 Under every wall.
 Yes. The gallery gabble
 Is the best of all.

ALWAYS

&ldquo;Il y a tous les jours quelque dam chose.&rdquo;
    &mdash;Abelard to Heloise.



 When Mrs. Mead was full of groans,
   When symptoms of all sorts assailed her,
 She sent for bluff old Doctor Jones,
   And told him all the things that ailed her.
 It took her nearly half the day,
   And when she finished out the string&mdash;
&ldquo;Ye-e-s, Mrs. Mead,&rdquo; drawled Doctor J.,
  &ldquo;There&#8217;s always some dam thing.&rdquo;


 I like the line. It&#8217;s worth a ton
   Of optimistic commonplaces.
 It&#8217;s tonic, it refreshes one,
   It cheers, it stimulates, it braces.
 It summarizes things so well;
   It has the philosophic ring.
 Has Kant or Hegel more to tell?
  &ldquo;There&#8217;s always some dam thing.&rdquo;


 The dean of all the cheer-up school
   Adjures sad hearts to cease repining,
 And intimates that, as a rule,
   The sun behind the cloud is shining.
&ldquo;Into each life&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; You know the rest;
   No need to finish out the string.
 Longfellow boiled might be expressed,
  &ldquo;There&#8217;s always some dam thing.&rdquo;

[Pg 83]
 When things go wrong I do not read
   The cheer-up poets, great or lesser.
 To soothe my soul I do not need
   The Neo-Thought of Mr. Dresser.
 Sufficient for each working day,
   With all the worries it may bring,
 That helpful line by Doctor J.,
  &ldquo;There&#8217;s always some dam thing.&rdquo;

THE MODERN MARINER



 A dry sheet and a lazy sea,
   And a wind so far from fast
 It barely floats the owner&#8217;s flag
   That flutters at the mast&mdash;
 That flutters at the mast, my boys;
   So while the sky is free
 Of cloud we&#8217;ll take a yachtsman&#8217;s chance
   And venture out to sea.


 The aneroid has dropped a tenth!
   Back, back across the bar
 To a harbor snug, and a long cold drink,
   And a big fat black cigar&mdash;
 A big fat black cigar, my boys;
   While, on an even keel,
 The Swedish chef out-chefs himself
   In getting up a meal.


 Give me a soft and gentle wind,
   A fleckless azure sky;
 I care not for your &ldquo;snoring breeze&rdquo;
   And dinners heaving high&mdash;
 And dinners heaving high, my boys,
   Make no great hit with me;
 So when the breeze begins to snore
   We&#8217;ll not put out to sea.

[Pg 85]
 There&#8217;s laughter in yon beach hotel,
   And summer girls a crowd;
 And hark the music, mariners,
   The band is piping loud!
 The band is piping loud, my boys,
   Bright eyes are flashing free.
 Come, fly the owner&#8217;s-absent flag
   And join the revelry.

 Musty, moldy, frazzled, and frayed&mdash;

 And east and west the people bawl,
 Dump them into the Cannery!&mdash;
 Into the brine go one and all.


&ldquo;Grilled&rdquo; and &ldquo;lauded&rdquo; and &ldquo;scored&rdquo; and &ldquo;flayed,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Common or garden variety,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Wave of crime&rdquo; and &ldquo;reform crusade,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Along these lines&rdquo; and &ldquo;it seems to me,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Noted savant,&rdquo; &ldquo;I fail to see,&rdquo;
 The &ldquo;groaning board&rdquo; of the &ldquo;banquet hall,&rdquo;&mdash;
 Masonjar &#8217;em in &ldquo;ghoulish glee&rdquo;&mdash;
 Into the brine go one and all.


&ldquo;Succulent bivalves,&rdquo; &ldquo;trusty blade,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Last analysis,&rdquo; &ldquo;practical-ly,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Lone highwayman&rdquo; and &ldquo;fusillade,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Millionaire broker and clubman,&rdquo; &ldquo;gee!&rdquo;

PANDEAN PIPEDREAMS

(Induced by smoking &ldquo;Pagan Pickings.&rdquo;)


I


This is something that I heard,
As the fluting of a bird,
On a certain drowsy day,
When my pipe was under way.
I was weary of the town,
And the going up and down;
Sick of streets and sick of noise,&mdash;
And I pined for Pagan joys.


 Daphne, here it is July!
 Just the month, my love, to fly
 To a sylvan solitude
 In the green and ancient wood.
 We will trip it as we go
 On the neo-Pagan toe,
 Sunny days and starry nights,
 Savoring the wild delights
 Of a turbulent desire
 That may set the wood on fire.


 We will play at hunt-the-fawn,
 In the neo-Dorian dawn.
 You will scamper through the brake,
 And I&#8217;ll follow in your wake&mdash;

[Pg 89]
 As the young Apollo ran
 In the piping days of Pan.
 You&#8217;ll escape me, without doubt,
 For I&#8217;m just a trifle stout;
 But, when I have lagged behind,
 Waiting for my second wynde,
 From some pretty hiding-place
 Will emerge your laughing face;
 I shall glimpse your eyes of blue,
 Hear your merry &ldquo;Peek-a-boo!&rdquo;


 What to wear? The Pagan plan
 Contemplates a coat of tan;
 But I fear we shall require
 Just a trifle more attire.
 Bushes scratch and brambles sting;
 Insect myriads are a-wing;&mdash;
 Heavens, how mosquitoes swarm
 When the woodland air is warm.
 (Mem: To take, when we elope,
 Tanglewood Mosquito Dope.)


 Do you like the picture, dear?
 Have you aught of doubt or fear?
 Have you any criticism
 Of my neo-Paganism?
 If not, dearie, let us fly
 To that passion-ripening sky,
 Where our souls may have their fling,
 And our every care take wing.

[Pg 90]
So the bird song fluted by,
Like a vagrant summer sigh&mdash;
Came, and passed, and was no more;
And my pleasant dream was o&#8217;er.
For arose the wraith of Doubt;
And I knew my pipe was out.


&nbsp;
[Pg 91]
II


This is something that befell
When my pipe was drawing well&mdash;
Something, rather, that I heard
As the fluting of a bird.


 Daphne, come and live with me
 In a Pagan greenery.
 Life will then be naught but play,
 One long Pagan holiday.
 We will play at hide and seek
 In the alders by the creek;
 Sport amid the cascade&#8217;s smother.
 Splashing water at each other;&mdash;
 Every moment pleasure wooing,
 Every moment something doing.
 If we talk, we&#8217;ll talk of Love:
 All its arguments we&#8217;ll prove.
 Such a mental rest you&#8217;ll find.
 Leave your intellect behind.


 Night will come, (for come it will,
 &#8217;Spite the fluting on the hill,)
 And we&#8217;ll pitch a cozy camp
 Where it isn&#8217;t quite so damp.
 While you dry your hair and laze
 By the campfire&#8217;s violet blaze,
 I will rob a balsam tree
 To construct a house for thee.
 What so dear as to be wooed
 In a sylvan solitude?

[Pg 92]
 What so sweet as Pagan vows
 Whispered in a house of boughs?
 Pagan love&#8217;s without alloy.
 Pagan kisses never cloy.
 Arms that cling in Pagan fashion
 Never tire. A Pagan passion
 Is the only kind I know
 That outlives a winter&#8217;s snow.
 Daphne, Daphne, let us fly!
 You&#8217;re a Pagan&mdash;so am I.


So the fluting on the hill
Passed and died, and all was still.
So the Pagan Pickings died,
And I laid the pipe aside.

THE LAUNDRY OF LIFE

(An Adventure in Sentiment.)



 Life is a laundry in which we
 Are ironed out, or soon or late.
 Who has not known the irony
            Of fate?


 We enter it when we are born,
 Our colors bright. Full soon they fade.
 We leave it &ldquo;done up,&rdquo; old and worn,
            And frayed;


 Frayed round the edges, worn and thin&mdash;
 Life is a rough old linen slinger.
 Who has not lost a button in
            Life&#8217;s wringer?


 With other linen we are tubbed,
 With other linen often tangled;
 In open court we then are scrubbed,
            And mangled.


 Some take a gloss of happiness
 The hardest wear can not diminish;
 Others, alas! get a &ldquo;domes-
            Tic finish.&rdquo;

WISDOM IN A CAPSULE


&ldquo;If she be not so to me.

 Mr. James&#8217;s pragmatism.
 Test your troubles day by day
 With it, and they fly away.
 Is the weather boiling hot,
 Hot enough to boil a pot&mdash;
 If it be not so to me,
 What care I how hot it be?


 Take a pudding made of bread;
 Much against it has been said;
 But it does not lack defense&mdash;
 Many say it is immense.
 Be it damned or be it blessed,
 Let us make the acid test&mdash;
 If it be not so to me,
 What care I how good it be?


 So with every blooming thing
 That has power to soothe or sting;
 Ships or shoes or sealing wax,
 Carrots, comets, carpet tacks.
 Every philosophic need
 Covered by this capsule creed:
 If it be not so to me,
 What care I how  it be?

THE LAND OF RAINBOW&#8217;S-END



 Young Faintheart lay on a wayside bank,
   Full prey to doubts and fears,
 When he did espy come trudging by
   A Pilgrim bent with years.
 His back was bowed and his step was slow,
   But his faith no years could bend,
 As he eagerly pressed to the rose-lit west
   And the Land of Rainbow&#8217;s-End.


&ldquo;It&#8217;s ho, for a pack!&rdquo; sang the Pilgrim gray,
 &ldquo;And a stout oak staff for friend,
And it&#8217;s over the hills and far away
  To the Land of Rainbow&#8217;s-End!&rdquo;


&ldquo;Thou&#8217;rt old,&rdquo; young Faintheart cried, &ldquo;thou&#8217;rt old,
   And there&#8217;s many a league to go;
 And still thou seekest the pot of gold
   At the farther end of the bow.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I am old, I am old,&rdquo; said the Pilgrim gray,
  &ldquo;But ever my way I&#8217;ll wend
 To the rose-lit hills of the dying day
   And the Land of Rainbow&#8217;s-End.&rdquo;


&ldquo;Come, rest thee, rest thee by my side;
   Give o&#8217;er thy doomsday quest.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Have done, have done!&rdquo; the Pilgrim cried:
  &ldquo;The light wanes in the west.[Pg 96]
 The road is long, but I shall not tire;
   I will lay my bones, God send,
 By the beautiful City of Heart&#8217;s Desire,

A BALLADE OF A BORE



 When the weather is warm and the glass running high
 And the odors of Araby tincture the air;
 When the sun is aloft in a white and blue sky,
 And the morrow holds promise of falling as fair;&mdash;
 In spring or in summer I&#8217;m free to declare,
 And the same I am equally free to maintain,
 One person has power my peace to impair:
 The man who tells limericks gives me a pain.


 When the foliage flushes and summer is by,
 And russet and red are the popular wear;
 When the song of the woodland is changed to a sigh
 And the horn of the hunter is heard by the hare;&mdash;
 In the season of autumn I&#8217;m free to declare,
 And my language is lucid and simple and plain,
 One person&#8217;s acquaintance I freely forswear:
 The man with the limerick gives me a pain.


 When the landscape is iced and the snow feathers fly,
 When the fields are all bald and the trees are all bare,
 And the prospect which nature presents to the eye
 Is chiefly distinguished by glitter and glare;&mdash;
[Pg 98]
 In the season of winter I&#8217;m free to declare
 That the limerick person is flat and inane.
 This person, I think, we could easily spare:
 The man who tells limericks gives me a pain.

THE POLE

(Tune: &ldquo;Carcassonne.&rdquo;)



 I&#8217;m an old man, I&#8217;m eighty-three,
   I seldom get away;
 My work, it keeps me close at home&mdash;
   I have no time for play.
 If it were not for the journey back,
   That so fatigues a soul,
 I&#8217;d like to take a little trip&mdash;
   I never have seen the Pole.


 &#8217;Tis said that in that favored place
   There is no heat or drouth;
 And that, whichever way you turn,
   You&#8217;re looking south-by-south.
 Some say there is a flagstaff there,
   Some say there is a hole.
 Think of the years that I have lived
   And never have seen the Pole!


 The parson a hundred times is right&mdash;
   We ought to stay at home.
 I&#8217;m an old man, I&#8217;m eighty-three,
   I have no call to roam.
 And yet if I could somehow find
   The time&mdash;God bless my soul!&mdash;
 I think that I would die content
   If I only could see the Pole!

 My brother has seen Baraboo,
   If so he speak the truth;
 My wife and son they both have been
   As far as to Duluth;
 My cousin cruised to Eastport, Maine,

 I&#8217;ve been as far as Mackinac&mdash;
   But I never have seen the Pole!

 Mute inquiry is in men&#8217;s looks;

THE VANISHED FAY



 Tell me, whither do they go,
 All the Little Ones we know?
 They &ldquo;grow up&rdquo; before our eyes,
 And the fairy spirit flies.
 Time the Piper, pied and gay&mdash;
 Does he lure them all away?
 Do they follow after him,
 Over the horizon&#8217;s brim?


 Daughter&#8217;s growing fair to see,
 Slim and straight as popple tree.
 Still a child in heart and head,
 But&mdash;the fairy spirit&#8217;s fled.
 As a fay at break of day,
 Little One has flown away,
 On the stroke of fairy bell&mdash;
 When and whither, who can tell?


 Still her childish fancies weave
 In the Land of Make Believe;
 And her love of magic lore
 Is as avid as before.
 Dollies big and dollies small
 Still are at her beck and call.
 But for all this pleasant play,
 Little One has gone away.

[Pg 103]
 Whither, whither have they flown,
 All the fays we all have known?
 To what &ldquo;faery lands forlorn&rdquo;
 On the sound of elfin horn?
 As she were a woodland sprite,
 Little One has vanished quite.
 Waves the wand of Oberon:
 Cock has crowed&mdash;the fay is gone!





[Pg 104]
AUTUMN REVERY



 When the leaves are falling crimson
   And the worm is off its feed,
 When the rag weed and the jimson
   Have agreed to go to seed,
 When the air in forest bowers
   Has a tang like Rhenish wine,
 And to breathe it for two hours
   Makes you feel you&#8217;d like to dine,
 When the frost is on the pumpkin
   And the corn is in the shock,
 And the cheek of country bumpkin
   City faces seems to mock,&mdash;
 When you come across a ditty
   (Like this one) of Autumn&#8217;s charm,
 Then it&#8217;s pleasant in the city,
   Where they keep the houses warm.




[Pg 105]
THE RECOIL



 I met a friend of lofty brow&mdash;
 As lofty as the laws allow.
 I said to him, &ldquo;You&#8217;ll know, I&#8217;m sure&mdash;
 What&#8217;s doing now in litrychoor?&rdquo;
 Said he: &ldquo;I hate the very name;
 I&#8217;m weary of the blooming game.
 I read, whenever I have time,
 Something by Phillips Oppenheim.&rdquo;


&ldquo;Cheer up!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;What&#8217;s new in Art?&mdash;
 You drift around the picture mart.
 What do you think of Mr. Blum?&mdash;
 Some say he&#8217;s great, some say he&#8217;s bum.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&#8217;m strong for Blum,&rdquo; my friend replied;
&ldquo;His pictures are so queer and pied.
 I wouldn&#8217;t change them if I could;
 I&#8217;d rather have things queer than good.&rdquo;


 I spoke of this, I spoke of that,
 But everything was stale and flat.
 Said I, &ldquo;You once adored the chaste,
 You used to have such perfect taste.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Good taste,&rdquo; he wailed, &ldquo;brings but distress,
 &#8217;Tis an affliction, nothing less;
 While those whose taste is punk and vile
 Are happy all the blessed while.&rdquo;

[Pg 106]
&ldquo;Oh, take a brace, old man!&rdquo; said I.
&ldquo;Let me prescribe a nip of rye,
 And then we&#8217;ll go to see a play;
 I&#8217;ve two for Barrymore to-day.&rdquo;
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he groaned; &ldquo;&#8217;twould be a bore,
 With all respect to Barrymore.&rdquo;
 Said I: &ldquo;Then whither shall we go?&rdquo;
 Said he: &ldquo;A moving picture show.&rdquo;





[Pg 107]
THE CORONATION

Lang Syne.



 Twas a holy mystery
 In the days of chivalry.
 More than pageant was the Rite
 In the sight of clod and knight.
 Sword and Scepter, Orb and Rod,
 Faith in self and faith in God;
 Oaths of Homage fiercely flung,
 Faith in heart and faith in tongue;&mdash;
   Gone the things that meaning gave
  &ldquo;With the old world to the grave.&rdquo;

&nbsp;
1911.


 Knightly faith was born to fade:
 Now the Rite is masquerade.
 Now a cockney paladin
 Winds a penny horn of tin.
 Where in reverence heads were bowed
 Surges now a careless crowd;
&ldquo;Muddied oafs&rdquo; and &ldquo;flanneled fools&rdquo;
 Jostle &ldquo;Yanks&rdquo; with camping stools;&mdash;
   Gone the things that meaning gave
  &ldquo;With the old world to the grave.&rdquo;





[Pg 108]
SONS OF BATTLE



 Let us have peace, and Thy blessing,
   Lord of the Wind and the Rain,
 When we shall cease from oppressing,
   From all injustice refrain;
 When we hate falsehood and spurn it;
   When we are men among men.
 Let us have peace when we earn it&mdash;
   Never an hour till then.


 Let us have rest in Thy garden,
   Lord of the Rock and the Green,
 When there is nothing to pardon,
   When we are whitened and clean.
 Purge us of skulking and treason,
   Help us to put them away.
 We shall have rest in Thy season;
   Till then the heat of the fray.


 Let us have peace in Thy pleasure,
   Lord of the Cloud and the Sun;
 Grant to us &aelig;ons of leisure
   When the long battle is done.
 Now we have only begun it;
   Stead us!&mdash;we ask nothing more.
 Peace&mdash;rest&mdash;but not till we&#8217;ve won it&mdash;
   Never an hour before.





[Pg 109]
MY LADY NEW YORK



 O siren of tresses peroxide,
   And heart that is hard as a flint,
 Blue orbs of complacency ox-eyed,
   That light at the mark of the mint,
 Ears only for jingle of joybells,
   A conscience as light as a cork&mdash;
 You are wedded to follies and foibles,
   My Lady New York.


 True, you have (not enough, tho&#8217;, to hurt you)
   Your moods and your manners austere;
 You have visions and vapors of virtue,
   And &ldquo;reform&rdquo; for a time has your ear;
 But of chaste Puritanic embraces
   You soon have enough and to spare,
 And then you kick over the traces,
   And virtue forswear.


 So go it, milady! Foot fleetly
   The paths that are primrose and gay;
 Abandon your fancy completely
   To follies and fads of the day.
&ldquo;Reform&rdquo; is a something that throttles
   The joys of the pace that&#8217;s intense&mdash;
 Smash hearts, reputations, and bottles,
   And ding the expense!





[Pg 110]
BALLADE OF THE PIPESMOKE CARRY



 The Ancient Wood is white and still,
 Over the pines the bleak wind blows,
 Voiceless the brook and mute the rill,
 Silence too where the river flows.
 Still I catch the scent of the rose
 And hear the white-throat&#8217;s roundelay,
 Footing the trail that Memory knows,
 Over the hills and far away.


 I have only a pipe to fill:
 Weaving, wreathing rings disclose
 A trail that flings straight up the hill,
 Straight as an arrow&#8217;s flight. For those
 Who fare by night the pole star glows
 Above the mountain top. By day
 A blasted pine the pathway shows
 Over the hills and far away.


 The Ancient Wood is white and chill,
 But what know I of wintry woes?
 The Pipesmoke Trail is mine at will&mdash;
 Naught may hinder and none oppose.
 Such the power the pipe bestows,
 When the wilderness calls I may
 Tramping go, as I smoke and doze,
 Over the hills and far away.

&nbsp;
[Pg 111]
       L&#8217;Envoi


 Deep in the canyons lie the snows:
 They shall vanish if I but say&mdash;
 If my fancy a-roving goes
 Over the hills and far away.





[Pg 112]
POST-VACATIONAL



 You have heard that mildewed story,
 That tradition horned and hoary,
   That it wearies one to roam,
         Past a doubt;
 That one vainly on vacation
 Tries to find recuperation,
   Till he hunts his happy home
         Tuckered out.


 That abroad there is no comfort,
 That a man must journey home for &#8217;t&mdash;
   You have heard that whiskered wheeze,
         Have you not?
 &#8217;Tis a commonplace to cavil
 At the &ldquo;luxuries of travel,&rdquo;
   For in travel lack of ease
         Is your lot.


 You have heard that gag historic;
 It was often sprung by Yorick;
   It&#8217;s as old as Noah&#8217;s ark
         And its crew.
 It&#8217;s the commonest (at basis)
 Of all common commonplaces;&mdash;
   So I merely would remark
         That&mdash;it&#8217;s true.





[Pg 113]
THE BARDS WE QUOTE



 Whene&#8217;er I quote I seldom take
 From bards whom angel hosts environ;
 But usually some damned rake
            Like Byron.


 Of Whittier I think a lot,
 My fancy to him often turns;
 But when I quote &#8217;tis some such sot
            As Burns.


 I&#8217;m very fond of Bryant, too,
 He brings to me the woodland smelly;
 Why should I quote that &ldquo;village roo,&rdquo;
            P. Shelley?


 I think Felicia Hemans great,
 I dote upon Jean Ingelow;
 Yet quote from such a reprobate
            As Poe.


 To quote from drunkard or from rake
 Is not a proper thing to do.
 I find the habit hard to break,
            Don&#8217;t you?





[Pg 114]
THE PERSISTENT POET



&ldquo;I remember, I remember&rdquo;&mdash;
   Something special? Not a bit.
 But, you see, this is November,
   And Remember rimes with it.




[Pg 115]
HENCE THESE RIMES



 Tho&#8217; my verse is exact,
   Tho&#8217; it flawlessly flows,
 As a matter of fact
   I would rather write prose.


 While my harp is in tune,
   And I sing like the birds,
 I would really as soon
   Write in straightaway words.


 Tho&#8217; my songs are as sweet
   As Apollo e&#8217;er piped,
 And my lines are as neat
   As have ever been typed,


 I would rather write prose&mdash;
   I prefer it to rime;
 It&#8217;s less hard to compose,
   And it takes me less time.


&ldquo;Well, if that be the case,&rdquo;
   You are moved to inquire,
&ldquo;Why appropriate space
   For extolling your lyre?&rdquo;


 I can only reply
   That this form I elect
 &#8217;Cause it pleases the eye,
   And I like the effect.





[Pg 116]
THE OLD ROLLER TOWEL



 How dear to this heart is the old roller towel
   Which fond recollection presents to my view.
 It hung like a pall on the wall of the washroom,
   And gathered the grime of the linotype crew.
 The sink and the soap and the lye that stood by it
   Remain; but the towel is gone past recall.
 O tempora! Also, O mores! Sic transit
   The time-honored towel that creaked on the wall.
 The grimy old towel, the slimy old towel,
 The tacky old towel that hung on the wall.


 Now hangs in the washroom a huge roll of paper&mdash;
   The old printer&#8217;s towel we&#8217;ll never see more.
 The new (see directions) is &ldquo;used like a blotter,&rdquo;
   And crumpled and scattered in wads on the floor.
 And often, when drying my hands in this fashion,
   The tears of remembrance will gather and fall,
 And I sigh (though I&#8217;m not what you&#8217;d call sentimental)
   For the classic old towel that propped up the wall.
 The sainted old towel, the tainted old towel,
 The gooey old towel that hung on the wall.





[Pg 117]
UP CULTURE&#8217;S HILL

(The confession of a club lady.)



 The path up Culture&#8217;s Hill is steep,
   And weary is the way,
 With very little time for sleep
   And none at all for play.


 She that this toilsome task essays
   Must never bat an eye,
 But keep her firm, unwavering gaze
   Forever fixed on high.


 For should she ever careless grow,
   And let her glances stray
 Down to the shallow vale below,
   Where Pleasure&#8217;s Court holds sway&mdash;


 Lured by the thrice forbidden fruit,
   She&#8217;d lose her equipoise,
 And like a wayward Pleiad shoot
   Down to forbidden joys.


 I&#8217;ve been but short time on the road,
   My courage still is strong;
 Yet often have I felt the goad
   That hurries me along.


 I&#8217;ve fallen over Maeterlinck,
   And bumped myself to tears,
 Burne-Jones&#8217;s pictures made me blink,
   And Wagner hurts my ears.

[Pg 118]
 I&#8217;ve stumbled over Ibsen humps
   And over Rembrandt rocks,
 I&#8217;ve got some fierce Debussy bumps,
   Some awful Nietsche knocks.


 I&#8217;m wearied by the ceaseless quest,
   I&#8217;m wayworn and footsore.
 I&#8217;ve Culture till I cannot rest&mdash;
   Yet still I climb for more.


 But oh, when all is done and said,
   Upon some manly breast
 I&#8217;d like to lay my tired head
   And take a good long rest.





[Pg 119]
THE PASSIONAL NOTE

&ldquo;The erotic motive is almost entirely absent from American
poetry. Even our younger American poets are more
profoundly interested in the why and wherefore of things
than in the girdle of Helen or the gleaming limbs of &lsquo;the
white implacable Aphrodite.&rsquo;&rdquo;
&mdash;Mr. Sylvester Viereck.



 In the years of my season erotic,
   When Eros was lord of my days,
 And I loved, with a love idiotic,
   The Mabels and Madges and Mays;
 When a purple and passionate lyric
   Would sing all the night in my head,&mdash;
 I yearned, like the young Mr. Viereck,
   For everything red.


 I doted on poems of passion,
   And put my own pantings in rime,
 To celebrate, after a fashion,
   The damsels who took up my time.
 I fed upon Swinburne, believe me,
   I feasted on Byron and Burns,
 And couplets from Sappho would give me
   Most exquisite turns.


 How apparent it was that our songbirds&mdash;
   Our Emerson, Lowell, and Payne,
 And Bryant and Drake&mdash;were the wrong birds
   To pipe to the passional strain.
[Pg 120]
 There was, in a word, nothing doing
   In all of the rimes that they wrote;
 They seemed to be always pursuing
   The ethical note.


 What truth, I inquired, was so mighty,
   What ethical thing was so rare,
 As the limbs of the white Aphrodite
   Or a strand of her heaven-kissed hair!
 The girdle of red-headed Helen
   Outweighed all the wherefores and whys,
 And Wisdom elected to dwell in
   A pair of blue eyes.


Now lyrical sizzlers and scorchers
   Fail somehow to set me ablaze;
 No longer are exquisite tortures
   Provoked by these passionate lays.
 I&#8217;ve tinned&mdash;and I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve missed &#8217;em&mdash;
   The poems of passion and sin.
Some things one gets out of one&#8217;s system,
   And other things in.





[Pg 121]
L&#8217;ENVOI.



&ldquo;Go, little book,&rdquo; as Poet Southey said;
   You might be better and you might be worse.
 With just one word of warning you are sped:
   Remember, you&#8217;re not Poetry&mdash;you&#8217;re Verse.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
