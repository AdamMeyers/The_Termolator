WITHIN THE CAPES.




CHAPTER I.


CERTAIN members of Captain Tom Granger’s
family have asked him, time and time again,
why he did not sit down and write an account of
those things which happened to him during a certain
period of his life.

These happenings, all agree, are of a nature such
as rarely fall to the lot of any man, crowding, as
they did, one upon the heels of another, so that in
two years’ time more happened to Tom Granger
than happens to most men in a lifetime.

But Captain Granger has always shaken his
head, and has answered that he was no writer and
that a pen never did fit nicely betwixt his stiff
fingers, as Mrs. Granger can tell them if they will
ask her.

Beside this, he has hitherto had his affairs to
look after, so that he may be able to leave behind
him enough of the world’s goods to help his children[2]
and his children’s children easily along the
road that he himself found not over smooth.

Now, however, he has given up much of his
business to the care of his sons, who are mostly
men well on in years, with families of their own,
and who are discreet in the management of things.
Therefore, having much more leisure time upon his
hands than he has ever had in his life before, he
will undertake to do as he has been asked, and to
write a plain, straightforward story of his adventures.
This he does with much diffidence, for, as I
have said, he is no very good hand with the pen
and the ink-horn. The story may be told in a
rough way; nevertheless, I believe that many of
those that read it will think well of it, having a
certain tenderness for the writer thereof.

I am furthermore inclined to thus take upon
myself the transcribing of the history of these
things, because that Captain Tom Granger is
coming fast to the ending of his life; and, though
his latter days may be warm and sunny, like a late
Indian summer, there are those yet to come in a
few years who will not have the chance to hear of
these things from his own lips. Therefore, as there
has been much gossip about certain adventures
that befell him, I would rather that they should
learn of them under mine own hand than from
hearsay. Truly, things get monstrously twisted
in passing from mouth to mouth, and by the time
that the story of these doings has passed down
through three or four generations, the old gentleman[3]
might be turned into a pirate and a murderer,
for all that I know, which would be a pretty state
of affairs.

I do not know how it was that Tom Granger got
the title of captain, for the highest grade that he
ever reached was that of second mate of the Privateersman
Nancy Hazlewood. However, as no
one in Eastcaster ever had held so high a grade of
the like nature up to that time, I suppose that the
wonder really is that he was not called commodore,
or even admiral.

Any one in Eastcaster can tell you where he
lives; it is the large white house, with the porch in
front, that stands well back from the road under the
shadow of three broad maple trees. It is just
across the way from the Hicksite Meeting-house.
You can easily tell it as you go along the street,
because there is a ship in full sail chiseled in relief
on the stone gate-post, which is very well done
indeed, and was carved by William Johnson, the
stone-cutter, under mine own direction and supervision.

I will say here, that Captain Granger will be
always glad to see you if, at any time, you should
chance to come to Eastcaster. If he is not at
home, you will be likely to find him playing
chequers or backgammon at the Black Horse
Tavern, just around the corner of Market street,
and nearly opposite to the court-house.

However, that is neither here nor there, and I find
that I am wandering from the point. But you must[4]
excuse and overlook that, bearing in mind that it is
the way of an old man, who has done a great deal of
talking in his day. I thank goodness that I am old
enough now to know better than to gossip and
talk as much as I used to do, and am rather silent
than otherwise.

Nevertheless, I promise now that I will heave
ahead with my yarn, though it may be that I will
leave some things untold that you would like to
hear, being, as I said, no great talker, in which case
you must come to Eastcaster, and then I will tell
you anything that you may want to know.

I will not enter into a long yarn concerning what
happened in Tom Granger’s life before the year
1812, for though such a yarn would hold within
it many concerns of interest, it is not for the sake
of relating them that I have thus taken my pen
betwixt my fingers. It was late in the spring of
that year (1812) when he returned home after a
three years’ cruise to the East Indies.

I think that there is no joy in all the world
like that of getting home again after a long voyage,
such as this had been. I do not know but that it
repays one for all the sorrow and pain of leave-taking,
and for the home-sickness that follows
thereon. Even such changes as have happened
betwixt the going and returning do not seem
amiss, provided that they have not brought grief
and trouble with them.

The changes that had occurred since Tom’s
departure in the summer of 1809 had brought no[5]
sadness with them. When he had gone away, he
had left his sisters, Susan and Mary, as young girls;
the former sixteen and the latter fifteen years old.
They had now grown into a pair of fine young
women and were chits no longer. This was the first
and greatest change that struck Tom, so you may
see how little had happened. The folks were already
beginning to tease Susan about Will Gaines, who
had just returned from Philadelphia, where he had
been studying law, and had set up an office for
himself in Eastcaster.

The next day was Sunday, or First-day, as we
call it in Quaker neighborhoods, and as all of the
family were going to meeting, Tom put on his
best toggery to go with them.

It was a beautiful, bright clear day, and as Tom
stood on the porch waiting for Henry, who was to
go with him, his heart swelled within him with the
love of home. It seemed sweet to him to look on
the young leaves of the trees, the green meadowlands
and the richness of growing wheat, after
seeing nothing for months but a wide stretch of
troubled waters; it was good to feel the balmy
blowing of a breeze that was not salt; to hear the
singing of the robin and the chattering of the wren;
the crowing of the cocks and the lowing of the
cattle, and not to have in his ears the everlasting
washing and gurgling of the water alongside.

The folks use to ride to meeting on horseback
in the old times, the women behind the men on
pillion saddles. But Tom was a sailor, and consequently[6]
no good figure on horseback, so he and
Henry, the youngest, set off ahead of the rest to
foot it, for the homestead farm was only a mile and
a half from Eastcaster meeting.

The meeting-house looked very pleasant where it
stood, back from the street under the shadow of
the two great elms in front of it. The old meeting-house
was standing then, for they did not tear it
down to make room for the new building until ’32.
The present building is larger than the old one was,
and is, no doubt, lighter and better, and more
comfortable in many ways; but for all that, I have
never liked it as well as the old black and red brick
meeting-house, with its high roof running up to a
point from all four corners and topped with something
that looked like a belfry, though it had no
bell in it, of course.

In the old days, as now, when the weather was
warm and bright and pleasant, the men used to
stand for a while around the door of their side of
the meeting, talking and chatting together before
they went into the building. Such a group was
standing on the grass under the shadow of the elm
trees as Tom and his brother Henry came up the
steps that led into the meeting-house yard.

Tom knew all of them, and they came forward
and shook hands with him and welcomed him
heartily. Will Gaines was amongst them, for,
though he was not a member of the Society of
Friends, he went to meeting as often as he went
anywhere else. It might have been that he came[7]
on Susan’s account, though I do not say that he
did.

He was the first to recognize Tom, and he came
forward and shook hands with him and seemed very
glad to see him. A young man usually is glad to
see the brother of the young woman that he wants
to marry, but I think that Will really was pleased
to see Tom, for he and Tom had been dear friends
from the time that they were children together.
There were other young men of Tom’s age amongst
the group: John Black, Joseph Sparks, Henry
Jackson and others. They too came forward and
shook hands with him and seemed glad to see him,
though not so glad as Will Gaines had been.

Two men were standing by the open door of the
meeting-house, talking earnestly together. One of
them was Isaac Naylor, and the other was Mr.
Edmund Moor, the real estate agent. As these
two men had very much to do with Tom’s life at a
later time, it may be well that I should give you a
notion of them now.

Isaac Naylor was a young man—not over thirty
at that time, I should think. He dressed very
plainly, and was so serious of deportment that I do
not know that any one ever saw him smile. He
never jested himself, and never enjoyed a jest, for
he was too practical for such trivial things. It was
as though the man of him had been dried into
parchment by his continued self-repression. He
was well off in the world, for his father had died
the year before, and, as Isaac was the only son, he[8]
had inherited all the property, which was very
large. Although such a young man, he was high
in the meeting, sitting in the gallery with men old
enough, in some cases, to be his grandfather.

Mr. Moor was not a member of meeting, though
he attended pretty regularly. He was a large,
fleshy man, not exactly fat, but full looking. He
had a smooth, goodly face and straight iron-grey
hair, brushed straight back from his forehead and
behind his ears. I never heard him say an unkind
word or saw him in anything but a cordial mood.
He was always full of jests and quaint turns of
speech, and never failed to shake Tom heartily by
the hand whenever he met him; yet for all that
Tom did not like him. He had an oily, unctuous
way, that was not pleasing to him; he was always
so goodly that he did not seem sincere, and always
so cordial that it did not seem as though he meant
his cordiality.

Such were the two men that were talking
together by the meeting-house door, and each
welcomed him in his own manner.

“How is thee, Thomas?” said Isaac, dryly.

“Why! It’s Thomas Granger! Bless my soul!
Back again like a bad penny, eh?” said Mr.
Moor, and he shook Tom by the hand with great
warmth.

In the meantime, Tom’s father and his two
brothers, John and William, came over from the
horse shed, where they had been hitching their
horses, and joined the group, and then they all[9]
went into the meeting-house together, taking their
seats on the hard wooden benches within.

That morning they held a silent meeting, no one
speaking for all the hour between ten and eleven
o’clock. Now and then the wind would rush in
little puffs through the open window and across the
gloom of the building. A fly buzzed against a
window pane, and once a robin outside burst into a
sudden gush of song.

No other sound broke the silence, saving for the
rustling of a dress, as one of the women Friends
would move in her seat, or the restless sighing of
some poor boy in the back part of the building.
The overseers sat ranged along on the raised bench
facing the meeting, and amongst them was Isaac
Naylor. All of them sat with their hats on,
motionless, with downcast eyes, buried in serious
thought: but no one spoke.

At such a time every one is supposed to address
a sermon to his own heart, but I am very much
afraid that Tom Granger addressed none to himself,
for his thoughts flew here and there and
everywhere, and his mind was never still a moment
in the chase of them. Now and then he shifted
himself uneasily on the hard wooden bench, trying
to find a more comfortable position than the one in
which he was sitting, but the seats in Friends’
meeting were not made with a thought to comfort
in those days. There was a long partition that ran
down the length of the meeting, separating the
men’s from the women’s side.[10]

After a while Tom’s eyes wandered over this
partition in a way that they had no business to do.
It was toward the place where his mother and his
sisters sat that his eyes rested the most, but it was
not at them that he was looking, for Patty Penrose
sat between his mother and him.

After a man has reached the age of four and
twenty, it becomes a continued source of wonder to
him how the little girls about him grow up into
young women. You leave a poor lean little chit
of a thing; a few years pass, you meet her and, lo!
she is transmogrified into a young woman, going
her sedate way with very different thoughts in her
head than when you saw her last. It seems as
though it were only a week or two since you
patted her upon the head and said kind things to
encourage her; now your heart shrinks at the
thought of such boldness, and you feel that she
needs encouragement no longer.

When Tom had last seen Patty Penrose, three
years before, he left her just such a little chit as I
have spoken to you of,—lean and not graceful.
She used to come over now and then to play with
his sister Mary, but he had not noticed her excepting
when she stayed to dinner or to supper.
Even then he had not observed her very closely,
and had not had much to say to her, for she
was too shy to make it a pleasure to him to
talk to her, and too young for it to be worth
while for him to put himself out to amuse her.
He would give her a nod with a “How is thee,[11]
Patty?” and then would turn his mind to other
things.

Now, when he first looked at her sitting across
the meeting beside his mother, he did not know
her; then he saw first one little thing and then
another, until it slowly dawned upon him that it
was Patty Penrose, though not the Patty Penrose
that he had known in times past. At first he
looked with wonder and interest at the change that
had come in three years; but, after a while, his
interest took a very different shape with no wonder
about it, and he thought that his sister Mary’s
friend was a great deal better worth looking at than
when he had last seen her, for Patty had grown
into a very pretty girl,—a very pretty girl, indeed.

She sat looking calmly before her; but, though
she seemed sedately unaware of his presence, as is
becoming in a modest girl, I have not a grain of
doubt that she knew that Tom Granger was at
meeting that day, and, maybe, she even knew that
he was looking at her at that moment.

Her head was uncovered, for she had worn a
broad beaver hat, such as they used in those days,
and she held the hat in her lap. She sat with her
side turned to Tom, and it made his heart feel very
warm as he looked at her pale, delicate face, the
long lashes of her eyes, the smooth roundness of
her chin and throat, and the soft curling of the
brown hair at her forehead and temples. So, as I
said, he was preaching no sermon to himself as he
sat in silent meeting that day.[12]

At length, the court-house clock around the
corner of Market street struck eleven. They all sat
in silence for a minute or two longer, and then old
Thomas Winterapple shook John Stidham by the
hand, and meeting was broken. After that they all
went out into the sunlight and the open air again.

Will Gaines went over to where the young
women were standing talking together, and said a
few words to Susan, and Tom followed after him.

Patty was standing beside his mother.

“Thomas, this is Patty Penrose,” said she, turning
to him; “don’t thee remember Patty?”

Tom knew that the color was rising in his face;
knowing it, he felt very uncomfortable, and that
made his cheeks burn all the hotter. It was a
different matter talking to Patty now from what it
had been three years ago. Oh, yes, he remembered
Patty; “How is thee, Patty?” said he, holding
out his hand to her. Her little fingers rested
in his only for a moment, and then were quickly
withdrawn.

“I’m pretty well, thank thee, Thomas,” said she.

Then there was a space of silence, during which
Tom was thinking of something to say. This was
no easy thing for him to do on the spur of the
moment, considering how little he knew of Patty
and her ways. He stood with his hands clasped
behind him, looking at her and waiting for a
thought, and she stood looking down at the toe of
her shoe. Presently she raised her eyes to his face
for a moment.[13]

“Has thee just come back, Thomas?” said she.

“Yes; I came back yesterday afternoon.”

“Thee’s been gone a long while this time, hasn’t
thee?”

“About three years.”

And then they were silent again.

Just then Isaac Naylor came up and spoke to
Patty, and she turned partly away from Tom to
answer him. It seemed to Tom that it was a relief
to her to talk to some one else beside him, and no
doubt it was, for she must have felt easier with
Isaac than she did with Tom, knowing him so
much better. After this, several of the young men
came up, and in a little while Patty and his sister
were quite surrounded by them, and were presently
talking and laughing at a great rate, about
people and things of which Tom knew little or
nothing. Isaac Naylor stood amongst the other
young men; he did not talk to Patty and Mary as
they did, but he seemed contented to remain where
he was.

At last Tom’s brother Henry plucked him by
the sleeve of his coat, “Is thee ready to go now,
Thomas?” said he. “Father and mother have
gone and I’m ready to go if thee is.” Henry was
too young yet to talk to the girls with any ease,
and so the waiting was no pleasure to him.

“Yes; I guess I’m about ready,” said Tom. He
felt that he had been awkward and ungainly before
Patty, and he would have liked to say a word or
two more to her before he left her to set himself[14]
straight in her opinion. But he saw no chance for
this in all the talk and laughter that was going on
around Mary and her, so there was nothing left for
him to do but to go.

As Henry and he walked along the turn-pike
road, numbers of Friends passed them on their way
homeward from meeting.

There was a clatter of hoofs behind them, and
old Elihu Penrose came riding by with Patty back
of him on the pillion saddle.

“Woah!” cried he, reigning in his horse when he
had come up to Tom and Henry. “How is thee,
Thomas? I’m glad to see thee back again.”

“I’m glad to get back again,” said Tom.

“That’s right! I like to hear a young man say
he’s glad to get back home again,—it sounds well.
Come over and see us some time.”

“I will,” said Tom; “I’d like to come over very
much.”

“Very well; do. Come over soon. Farewell.”

Then he clicked to the horse and rode on, turning
down the road that led through the shady
woods to the old mill.

“Patty Penrose’s a mighty pretty girl; ain’t she,
Thomas?” said Henry.

Tom made no answer, and they walked on in
silence.

At dinner time, Patty was brought up as a
subject of talk.

“Don’t thee think she’s very pretty, Thomas?”
said Susan.[15]

“Well—I don’t know,” said Tom, hesitatingly;
“n—not so very.” I do not know why he should
have answered as he did, but, somehow, he did not
feel like saying that he thought Patty was pretty.

“Well, I can’t help thinking as thee does about
it, Thomas,” said Mary; “I love Patty Penrose
very dearly, but, I must say, I never could see her
beauty.”

“She’s the prettiest girl in the neighborhood,”
said William.

“I know some people think she’s pretty,” said
Mary, “but, I must say, I don’t see where her
beauty lies. Her nose isn’t good, and she has
hardly a bit of color in her face. She’s a dear
good girl, but I don’t think she’s what one would
call handsome.”

“Thee isn’t of the same way of thinking as the
young men,” said John. “There isn’t one within
ten miles of Eastcaster who doesn’t think that she’s
the prettiest girl in the township. There isn’t a girl
in the neighborhood who has as much company
as she.”

“Nonsense,” said Susan; “what does thee know
about it, John? Leave out Isaac Naylor and
John Black and the two Sharpleys and she doesn’t
have any more company than other people.”

“All right,” said John, who had an ill way of
holding to an opinion and never arguing about it,
“all right, have thy own way; it doesn’t make any
difference to me; I only know what I hear the
young men say about her.”[16]

Then Tom’s father broke into the talk and nothing
more was said about Patty. “I bought a new
short-horn bull last fall, Thomas,” said he. “We’ll
go over to the cattle-yard after dinner and take a
look at it, if thee likes.”

So presently they all got up from their chairs,
and the men-folks went over to the barn-yard to
take a look at the short-horn bull.

But the talk at the dinner table had not pleased
Tom, though I do not know why he should have
disliked to have heard that Patty had a great deal
of attention paid her; for how could it make any
difference to him?



[17]




CHAPTER II.


AS time wore along, Tom got into the habit of
dropping in at Penrose’s and of spending an
evening now and then. At first he would find himself
there once in every ten days or two weeks; in
time his visits became more and more frequent.
Elihu was always very glad to see him and Patty
herself seemed pleased at his coming. I think that
some of the happiest evenings of his life were those
spent in sitting on the porch of the old mill-house
in the long summer twilights—Elihu and he smoking
their pipes, he telling his adventures at sea and
Patty sitting listening to him. Often some one of
the young men of the neighborhood would be at
the house, and then it was not so pleasant for Tom;
his talk would cease, and after a little while,
perhaps, he would arise and bid them farewell.
Patty and her visitor would usually sit apart talking
and laughing together, and it would strike Tom
how much more easy she seemed in the company
of others than she did with him. More than once
when he called he found that she had gone out
riding with one of these young men, and then he
and Elihu would spend the evening together, and[18]
the old man would seem quite contented, for
neither Patty nor he seemed to think that Tom’s
visits were meant for any one else than him.

One First-day evening Tom mustered up courage
to ask Patty to take a walk with him. That evening
is impressed upon his mind even yet, for he was
very happy. There was a dim glow in the sky to
the westward, and the road stretched away grey and
glimmering between the blackness of the banks
and bushes alongside of it. So, walking slowly
and talking but little, they came to the bridge just
below Whiteley’s barn, and there they stood leaning
on the parapet, looking up the stream into the
black woods beyond, from which came the many
murmuring whispers of the summer’s night. All
the air was laden with the spicy odor of the night
woods, and through the silence the sound of the
rushing and gurgling of the water of the brook
came to them clearly and distinctly. There was a
bit of marshy land beyond, over which flew fireflies
in thousands, here gleaming a brilliant spark and
there leaving a long trail of light against the black
woodlands behind. For some time they both
leaned upon the bridge without saying a word; it
was Patty that broke the silence at last.

“Does thee know, Thomas,” said she, “that
when thee first came home I was dreadfully afraid
of thee? Thee seemed to me to be so much older
than I was, and then thee’d seen so much on thy
travels.”

“Thee ain’t afraid of me now, is thee, Patty?”[19]

“No, indeed; it seems as though thee might
almost be a cousin of mine, I know thee so well.
It does father so much good to see thee; he’s never
been the same since mother died till now.”

There was a moment or two before Tom spoke.

“Perhaps it isn’t thy father I come to see, Patty,”
said he, in a low voice. He leaned over the edge
of the bridge as he spoke and looked fixedly into
the dark rushing water beneath.

Patty made no answer, and Tom was not sure that
she heard him. Neither of them said another
word until Patty said, in a low voice, “I guess we’d
better go home now, Thomas.”

Then they turned and walked back again to the
old mill. Tom opened the gate for Patty. “Farewell,
Patty,” said he.

“Won’t thee come up and see father, Thomas?”
said she.

“Not to-night.”

“Farewell, then.”

Tom watched her until she had gone up the
porch steps and was hidden by the vines that were
clustered about it. He heard Elihu say, “Where’s
Thomas?” but he did not hear Patty’s answer;
then he turned and walked slowly homeward.

The summer passed, the fall passed, the winter
passed, and the spring time had come again.

Tom’s walk with Patty seemed to have broken
through the smoothness of the acquaintance betwixt
the three.

Elihu had never been the same to him since that[20]
night; he had never been as cordial or as friendly
as he had been before.

Sometimes it seemed to Tom as though Patty
herself was growing tired of seeing so much of
him. At such times he would vow within himself
as he walked homeward that he would never call
there again, and yet he always went back after a
while.

So things moved along without that pleasant
friendliness in their acquaintanceship until that
occurred which altered the face of everything.

One First-day afternoon, Tom found himself
standing on the porch of the mill-house. It was in
the early part of April, but the day was very mild
and soft, and Elihu and Patty were sitting on the
porch.

“How is thee, Thomas?” said Elihu. He did
not take the pipe from his lips as he spoke, neither
did he ask the other to be seated. Tom stood
leaning against the post and no one spoke for a
while.

“Isn’t it a lovely day?” said Patty.

“Yes, it is,” said Tom; “would thee like to take
a walk up the road as far as Whiteley’s?”

“Yes, I would,” said Patty; “I haven’t been away
from the house all day.”

“It’s very damp; it’s too damp to walk,” said
Elihu; “besides, thee’s got thy thin shoes on.”

“But we’ll walk in the road, father; I’ll promise
not to go off of the road. I’ll put on heavier shoes
if thee thinks that these are too thin.”[21]

“Very well, do as thee pleases,” said Elihu,
sharply; “I think it’s too damp, but I suppose
thee’ll do as thee chooses.” Then he knocked the
ashes out of his pipe and went into the house
without another word, shutting the door carefully
behind him.

“I don’t know why he doesn’t want me to go,”
said Patty; “it’s a lovely day for a walk. Wait till
I go in and speak to him, maybe he’ll change his
mind;” and she followed her father into the house.

“I can’t bear this any longer;” said Tom to himself.
“I’ll have it over this afternoon, or I’ll never
come here again. I’ll ask her to be my wife, and
if the worst comes to the worst I’ll ship for
another cruise.”

Presently Patty came out of the house again.
She had thrown a scarf over her shoulders. “Is
thee ready to go, Thomas?” said she.

“Yes; I’m ready.”

There was very little talk between them as they
walked on side by side, for Tom’s heart was too
full of that which was upon his mind to say much
with his lips; so they went down the road into the
hollow, past the old mill, over the bridge that
crossed Stony Brook just beyond, up the hill on
the other side, past Whiteley’s farm-house, and so to
the further crest of the hill that overlooked Rocky
Creek Valley beyond. There they stopped and
stood beside the fence at the roadside, looking
down into the valley beneath them. It was a fair
sight that lay spread out before their eyes—field[22]
beyond field, farm-house, barn and orchard, all
bathed in the soft yellow sunshine, saving here and
there where a cloud cast a purple shadow that
moved slowly across the hills and down into the
valleys.

“Isn’t it beautiful?” said Patty, as she leaned
against the rough fence, looking out across the
valley, while the wind stirred the hair at her cheeks
and temples.

“Yes; it is;” said Tom, “it’s a goodly world to
live in, Patty.”

Then silence fell between them.

“There’s the old Naylor homestead,” said Patty
at last.

“Yes; I see it,” said Tom, shortly, glancing as
he spoke in the direction which she pointed. Then,
after a while, he continued, “What a queer man
Isaac Naylor is!”

“I don’t see anything queer about him,” said
Patty, looking down at the toe of her shoe.

“Well, I never saw a man like him.”

“He is a very good worthy man, and everybody
respects him,” said Patty, warmly.

“Oh! I don’t deny that,” said Tom, with a pang
at his heart.

“Thee couldn’t truthfully deny it if thee would,
Thomas,” said Patty.

“I’m only a rough sea-faring man,” said Tom.
“I don’t know that any one respects me very much.”
He waited a moment, but Patty said nothing; then
he went on again:[23]

“For all that, I’d rather be a man of thirty at
thirty, and not as dead to all things as though I
was a man of eighty. Isaac Naylor is more like a
man of eighty than he is like one of thirty. No
one would take him to be only five years older
than I am.”

“I don’t know any man that I respect as much
as I do Isaac Naylor,” said Patty. “I don’t like
to hear thee talk against him as thee does. He
has never spoken ill of thee.”

“Thee need never be afraid of my saying anything
more against him,” said Tom, bitterly; “I see
that thee likes him more than I thought thee did.
I might have known it too, from the way that he has
been visiting thee during this last month or two.”

“Why shouldn’t he visit me, Thomas?”

“The Lord knows!”

She made no answer to this, and presently Tom
spoke again.

“I’m going off to sea before long, Patty,” said he,
for it seemed to him just then that the sea was a
fit place for him to be. Patty made no answer to
this; she was picking busily at the fringe of the
scarf that hung about her shoulders.

“How soon is thee going, Thomas?” said she at
last.

“Oh! I don’t know; in three or four weeks, I
guess. It doesn’t matter, does it?”

Patty made no reply.

Tom was leaning on the fence, looking out
across the valley, but seeing nothing. His mind[24]
was in a whirl, for he was saying unto himself,
“Now is the time, be a man, speak your heart
boldly, for this is the opportunity!”

Twice he tried to bring himself to speak, and
twice his heart failed him. The third time that he
strove, he broke the silence.

“Patty,” said he. His heart was beating thickly,
but there was no turning back now, for the first
word had been spoken.

Patty must have had an inkling of what was in
Tom’s mind, for her bosom was rising and falling
quickly.

“Patty,” said Tom again.

“What is it, Thomas?” said she, in a trembling
voice, and without raising her head.

Tom was picking nervously at the rough bark
upon the fence-rail near to him, but he was looking
at Patty.

“Thee knows why I have been coming to see
thee all this time, doesn’t thee, Patty?”

“No,” whispered Patty.

“Thee doesn’t know?”

“No.”

It seemed to Tom as though the beating of his
heart would smother him: “Because,—because I
love thee, Patty,” said he.

Patty’s head sunk lower and lower, but she
neither moved nor spoke.

Then Tom said again, “I love thee, Patty.”

He waited for a while and then he said: “Won’t
thee speak to me, Patty?”[25]

“What does thee want me to say?” whispered
she.

“Does thee love me?”

Silence.

“Does thee love me?”

Tom was standing very close to her as he
spoke; when she answered it was hardly above her
breath, but low as the whisper was he caught it—

“Yes.”

Ah me! those days have gone by now, and I am
an old man of four score years and more, but even
yet my old heart thrills at the remembrance of
this that I here write. Manifold troubles and griefs
have fallen upon me betwixt then and now; yet,
I can say, when one speaks to me of the weariness
of this world and of the emptiness of things
within it, “Surely, life is a pleasant thing, when
it holds such joys in store for us as this,—the
bliss of loving and of being loved.”

Half an hour afterward, Tom was walking down
the road toward the old mill-house, and in his hand
he held the hand of his darling—his first love—and
life was very beautiful to him.



[26]




CHAPTER III.


NOW, although the good people of Eastcaster
were very glad to welcome Tom Granger
home again whenever he returned from a cruise, at
the same time they looked upon him with a certain
wariness, or shyness, for they could not but feel
that he was not quite one of themselves.

Now-a-days one sees all kinds of strange people;
the railroad brings them,—young men who sell
dry-goods, books and what not. They have
traveled all over the country and have, or think
that they have, a world more of knowledge
about things in general than other people who are
old enough to be their father’s father. Such an one
I saw this morning, who beat me three games of
chequers, which, I own, did vex me; though
any one might have done the same, for I was
thinking of other things at the time, and my mind
was not fixed upon the run of the game. One
sees plenty of such people now-a-days, I say, but
in the old times it was different, and few strangers
came to Eastcaster, so that but little was known
of the outside world. The good people liked well
enough to hear Tom tell of the many out-of-the-way[27]
things that had happened to him during his
knocking about in the world; at the same time
there was always a feeling amongst them that he
was different from themselves. Tom knew that
they felt this way, and it made him more shy of
going amongst his father’s neighbors than he would
otherwise have been. Nothing makes a man withdraw
within himself as much as the thought that
those about him neither understand him nor care to
understand him. So it came about that Elihu Penrose
was not very much pleased with that which had
passed between Tom Granger and his daughter.

As Tom and Patty walked home hand in hand,
hardly a word was said betwixt them. When they
came to the gate in front of the mill-house they saw
that Elihu was not on the porch.

“I’ll go in and speak to thy father now, Patty,”
said Tom.

“Oh, Tom! Will it have to be so soon?” said
Patty, in a half-frightened voice.

“The sooner spoken, the sooner over,” said Tom,
somewhat grimly, for the task was not a pleasant
one to do, as those who have passed through the
same can tell if they choose.

So Tom went into the house, and Patty sat down
on a chair on the porch to wait for his coming out
again.

Tom looked in through the half-open door of the
dining-room and saw Elihu sitting in his cushioned
rocking-chair in front of the smouldering fire,
rocking and smoking the while.[28]

“May I come in?” said Tom, standing uncertainly
at the door.

“Yes; come in,” said Elihu, without moving.

“I have something to tell thee,” said Tom.

“Sit down,” said Elihu.

Tom would rather have stood up, for he felt
easier upon his feet; nevertheless, he sat down as
he was bidden, leaning his elbows on his knees
and gazing into the crown of his hat, which he
held in his hand and turned about this way and
that.

Old Elihu Penrose’s eyebrows were bushy and
thick, and, like his hair, were as white as though
he had been in the mill of time, and a part of the
flour had fallen upon him. When he was arguing
upon religion or politics, and was about to ask
some keen question that was likely to trip up the
wits of the one with whom he was talking, he had
a way of drawing these thick eyebrows together,
until he had hidden all of his eyes but the grey
twinkle within them. Though Tom did not raise
his head, he felt that the old man drew his eyebrows
together just in this manner, as he looked
upon him where he sat.

Not a word was spoken for some time, and the
only sounds that broke the stillness of the room
was the regular “creak, creak” of the rocker of
the chair on which Elihu sat, and the sharp and
deliberate “tick, tack” of the tall, old eight-day
clock in the entry.

Old Elihu broke the silence; he blew a thin[29]
thread of smoke toward the chimney, and then he
said: “What is it thee wants to say to me
Thomas?” And yet, I have a notion that he
knew very well what it was that Tom was going to
tell him.

Then Tom looked up and gazed straight into the
grey twinkle of Elihu’s eyes, hidden beneath their
overhanging brows. “I—I love thy daughter,”
said he, “and she’s promised to be my wife.”

Elihu looked at Tom as though he would bore
him through and through with the keenness of his
gaze, and Tom looked steadfastly back again at
him. He felt that Elihu was trying to look him
down, and he drew upon all of his strength of
spirit not to let his eyes waver for a moment. At
last Elihu arose from his chair and knocked the
ashes out his pipe into the fire-place.

Then Tom stood up too, for he was not going to
give the other the advantage that a standing man
has in a talk over one that is seated.

“Thomas,” began Elihu, breaking the silence
again, and he thrust his hand into his breeches
pocket, and began rattling the coppers therein.

“Well?” said Tom.

“I take it thee’s a reasonable man;—at least, thee
ought to be, after all the knocking around that
thee’s done.”

This did not sound very promising for the talk
that was to come. “I hope I’m a reasonable man,”
said Tom.

“Then I’ll speak to thee plainly, and without any[30]
beating about the bush;—I’m sorry to hear of this,
and I wish that it might have been otherwise.”

“Why?”

“I should think that thee might know why,
without putting me to the pains of telling thee.
We’re a plain folk hereabouts, and the son’s
followed in his father’s steps for a hundred and fifty
years and more. I suppose that it’s an old-fashioned
way that we have, but I like it. I’d
rather that my daughter had chosen a man that had
been contented with the ways of his father, and one
that I had seen grow up under my eye, and that I
might know that I could rely upon. I’ve seen little
or nothing of thee, since thee ran away to sea, ten
or twelve years ago.”

“I don’t see why that should weigh against me.”

“Don’t thee?”

“No. My trade isn’t farming, to be sure, but
such as it is, I work steadily at it. I’m sober; I
don’t drink, and I trust that I’m no worse than most
men of my age.”

“That may all be true; I know nothing of thy
habits, but this I do know,—that thee ran away
from home once; what surety have I that thee
won’t do it again?” Tom made a motion as though
to interrupt him, but Elihu held up his hand; “I
know! I know!” said he; “thee don’t feel, just
now, as though such a thing could happen; but my
observation has led me to find that what a man will
do once, he may do again. Besides all this, thy
trade must unsettle thy life more or less; thee[31]
knows the old saying,—‘a rolling stone gathers no
moss.’”

“I don’t know why a man should want to stay
long enough in one place to get moss-grown,”
said Tom.

“That is all very well,” said Elihu Penrose, “but
we hereabouts have been content to grow green
in the same place that our fathers grew green
before us. So, I tell thee plainly, I wish that Patty
had chosen some one that I know better than I do
thee. Of course, I shan’t bridle her choice, but I
wish that it had been Isaac Naylor. I believe that
she would have chosen him if thee hadn’t come
home amongst us.”

There was a time of silence between them in
which both were sunk deeply in thought; then
Tom spoke very bitterly: “I see thee don’t like
me.”

“Thee’s wrong to say that, Thomas,” said Elihu;
“I have no dislike for thee at all.”

“It looks very much as though thee had.”

“I don’t see that at all. I want to see my
daughter well settled in the world,—that’s all.”

“I should think that thy daughter’s happiness
would weigh more with thee than anything else.”

“It does,” said Elihu, somewhat sternly, “and I
hope that I shall know what is best for her happiness
without being taught by any man, young or
old.”

“I had no thought to teach thee.”

Silence followed this, till, after a while, Elihu[32]
spoke again. “However,” said he, “all this is
neither here nor there; Patty’s chosen thee from
amongst the rest, and she must lie upon the bed
that she’s made for herself, for I don’t see that I
can justly interfere. I can only make myself sure
that thee is able to support a wife, before thee
marries her. How much does thee make a year?”

“About five hundred for pay. Maybe I could
make a couple of hundred more in the way of
trade here and there, if I keep my wits about me.”

“Does thy trade bring thee in forty dollars a
month now?”

“About that.”

Elihu, sunk in thought, looked at Tom for a
while, without speaking. Tom stood looking at
his finger-tips, very unhappy and troubled in his
mind. After a while the absent look left Elihu’s
eyes, and he spoke again.

“Thomas,” said he, “I have no wish to be hard
on thee, or any man in the world. It’s not thee,
but thy trade, that don’t please me. If thee was
living quietly at home, like thy brothers John and
William, I’d be glad to give my daughter to thy
father’s son, for he and I have been old friends,
and have known each other since we were boys
together. However, I’m not prepared to say that
thee shall not marry Patty, so I’ll make a proposition
to thee. If thee’ll show me seven hundred
and fifty dollars of thy own earning at the end of a
year’s time, I am willing that thee shall have her.
Is that fair?”[33]

“Yes; I suppose it is,” said Tom.

“Very well. Show me seven hundred and fifty
dollars at the end of a year’s time from to-day, and
I’ll give thee leave to marry Patty. Farewell.”

“May I see Patty now?”

“I reckon so. There’s no reason that thee
shouldn’t see her that I know of.”

Then Tom left the room. He found Patty sitting
on the porch when he went out. He was feeling
very bitter, for his talk with Elihu had not been of
the pleasantest kind. It seemed to have taken
much of the joy out of his new happiness, for the
grudging words of Elihu’s consent had stung his
pride very sharply. Therefore there was a smack
of bitterness in his joy that spoilt the savor of the
whole. He sat down by Patty without a word, and
began rubbing his palm slowly over the end of the
arm of the chair on which he was sitting, looking
down at it moodily the while. It was both weak
and selfish in him to give way to such feelings at
such a time, but love is a subtle joy that only one
false chord will jar the whole out of tune, and, for
the time, there will be discord in the heart.

Patty sat looking at him, as though waiting for
him to speak.

“Thy father don’t seem much pleased with this,
Patty,” said he, at last.

“Never mind, Tom,” said Patty, and her little
hand slid over and rested softly upon his own;
“he’ll like it when he is more used to the thought
of it. Father’s queer, and sometimes harsh in his[34]
ways, but his heart is all right. No one could be
more kind and loving than he is to me. When he
finds how dear thee is to me, he’ll like thee for my
sake, if for nothing else. After a while he will
be as proud of thee as though thee were his own
son.”

“I hope that he will like me better, as time goes
on,” said Tom, but the tone of his voice said, “I
don’t believe he will.”

“Yes; his liking will come all in good time,
Tom;” then, very softly, “Isn’t thee happy, Tom?”

“Yes; I’m happy,” said Tom, but in truth, his
words belied his thoughts a little, and his voice, I
think, must have somewhat belied his words.

“Tom,” said Patty, and he looked up. She
looked bravely and lovingly into his eyes; “I am
very happy,” said she, in a low voice.

“God bless thee, Patty!” said Tom, in a voice
that trembled a little; “thee’s a good girl,—too
good a girl for me. I’m afraid I’m not worthy of
thee.”

“I’m satisfied,” said Patty, quietly. “Tell me;
what did father say to thee, Thomas?”

Then Tom told all that had passed, and the
telling of it seemed to blow away the dark clouds
of his moodiness; for, as he talked, it did not seem
to him that the old man’s words had been as bitter
as he had felt them to be at the time. After all, he
had said nothing but what he should have said,
considering that it behooved him to see his daughter
well settled in the world.[35]

“Thee can earn seven hundred and fifty dollars
in a year’s time, can’t thee, Thomas?”

“I hope so.”

“Then it’ll only be waiting a year, and that isn’t
a long time, Tom, is it? Thee’ll find me just the
same when thee comes back again.” Patty talked
very bravely;—I believe that she talked more
bravely than she felt, for her eyes were bright with
tears, beneath the lids.

“It’s pretty hard to have to leave thee so soon,”
said Tom. “I’ll have to leave thee soon if I’m to
earn all that money in a year’s time.”

Both were sunk in thought for a while. “How
long will it be before thee starts, Tom?” said Patty,
presently.

“Not longer than a week, I guess.”

Patty looked at him long and earnestly, and then
the tears brimmed in her eyes. Poor girl! What
happiness it would have been to her, if she could
have had Tom with her for a while, while their joy
was still fresh and new. The sight of her tears
melted away all the little bitterness that was still in
Tom’s heart; he drew her to him, and she hid her
face in his breast and cried. As he held her
silently, in his arms, it seemed to him that their
love had not brought them much happiness, so
far.

After a while, she stopped crying, but she still
lay with her face on his shoulder.

As Tom walked home that afternoon, he met
Isaac Naylor coming down the mill-road from the[36]
turnpike. He knew that Isaac was going straight
to Penrose’s house.

“How is thee, Thomas?” said he, as they passed
one another.

Tom stared at him, but said never a word. He
turned and looked after Isaac as the Friend walked
briskly down the road that led through the woods
to the mill.

“Never mind, friend Isaac,” said he, half-aloud,
“the father may like thee better than he does me,
but the daughter’s mine.” A thrill darted through
his heart as he said this, for it made him realize
that she was indeed his, and his alone. It was the
last time that he saw Isaac for a year and a half.

Tom went straight to his mother and told her
everything. A mother is nearer to her son in such
matters than a father, for there is more in a woman’s
sympathy than there is in a man’s. If he had had
any trouble in regard to money matters, he would,
no doubt, have gone to his father; but troubles
like these that were upon him were more fitted for
his mother’s ears.

“I wish thee’d never run away to sea,” said
Tom’s mother.

“I wish so too,” said Tom; “but it can’t be
helped now. I did run away to sea, and there’s an
end of it.”

“Can’t thee find some way of making a living at
home? Maybe Elihu Penrose would like thee
better than he does if thee could stay at home, as
other young men do.”[37]

“How can I make a living at home?” said Tom,
bitterly. “Can thee tell me of any way to make
it?”

“No; but something might turn up.”

“I can’t wait for the chance of something turning
up. I have seven hundred and fifty dollars to make
in twelve months’ time.”

Neither of them spoke for a while. Tom sat
beside his mother, and she was holding his hand
and softly stroking it the while.

“Mother,” said Tom, at last.

“Well, son?”

“Does thee know what I’ve pretty well made up
my mind to do?”

“What?”

“To go to Philadelphia on the stage to-morrow
morning, and to take the first berth that I can get.”

“Oh, Thomas! thee wouldn’t go so soon, surely!
What would Patty do?”

“Patty would have to bear it, mother. She’ll
have to bear it, anyhow. It’ll be just as hard to
leave to-morrow week as it will to-morrow. The
sooner I leave the sooner I’ll be back, thee knows.”

All this was very reasonable, but, nevertheless,
his heart failed him at the thought of leaving. “Of
course,” he burst out, after a while, “of course, it’s
as hard for me to go as it is for her to have me go.”

“I don’t know that, Thomas,” said his mother, in
a trembling voice. “Thy life will be full of work
and change. Patty will have nothing to do but to
think of thee.”[38]

“Well, all the same, its hard to leave her, and
the knowledge that she will suffer don’t make it
any the easier for me.”

He got up and began walking restlessly up and
down the room. Presently he stopped in front of
his mother.

“Yes, mother,” said he, “I’ll go on the stage
to-morrow morning. There’s no use putting it off
any longer, and I’d be a coward to do so.”

Then his mother put her handkerchief to her
face, and the tears that she was keeping back came
very freely.

The next morning at half-past seven o’clock Tom
knocked at the door of Elihu Penrose’s house.
The mill-house was about three-quarters of a mile
from the turnpike, and as he had to meet the stage
there about eight o’clock, he had only a few minutes
in which to say farewell.

He walked straight into the dining-room. Patty
was busy putting away the breakfast dishes, and
Elihu sat at his old brass-handled desk, footing up
his accounts. He looked up as Tom came in, and
the color flew into Patty’s cheeks.

“Thee’s beginning thy courting early in the
morning, Thomas,” said Elihu, dryly.

Tom vouchsafed no answer to this. He stood
leaning against the door-frame, and his eyes were
fixed upon Patty.

“I’m going to leave home this morning,” said he.

Neither of the three spoke for a moment or two.
Tom stood looking at Patty, his hands clasped in[39]
front of him, feeling unutterably miserable. Elihu
had arisen from his chair, and he and Patty were
gazing at Tom, surprised at the suddenness of what
he had told them. Then Elihu came forward and
laid his hand on Tom’s shoulder.

“Thomas,” said he, “does thee mean that thee
is going—”

“I mean that I’m going to leave Eastcaster for a
year,” said Tom.

“This is—this is very sudden, Thomas,” said he.

Tom nodded his head.

“Come, Thomas; I had no wish to be harsh
with thee yesterday,” said the old man. “I don’t
want to push thee to the wall. This is very sudden.
Put off thy going for a week or two. Look
here—even if thee don’t bring me the seven hundred
and fifty dollars just at the end of the year, I won’t
count it against thee.”

“It’s too late now,” said Tom. “My chest’s
packed, and father’s going to put it on the stage
for me. I’ll not be unmanly and put off the going,
now that everything is fixed for it. If I’d have
known how thee felt yesterday, I don’t deny that I
might have stayed a little while longer. But it
won’t do to stop now that I’ve started.”

All this he spoke without looking at Elihu.
Elihu took his hand from Tom’s shoulder. He
stood for a moment as though he were about to say
something farther; then he slowly picked up his
hat and left the room, and Tom and Patty were
alone.[40]

In about a quarter of an hour the old man came
back again. Tom looked up at the clock. It was
a quarter to eight, and he knew that the time was
come for him to go. Patty and he had been sitting
on the sofa, holding one another’s hand. They had
been silent for some time, and they both arose
without a word.

Tom stood looking long and earnestly at Patty.
Her face was bowed upon her breast. “Patty, my
darling,” whispered he, and then she looked up.

Her eyes were brimming with the tears that she
had kept so bravely hidden until now, and then
two bright drops ran slowly down her cheeks.

“Farewell, my darling,” murmured he, in a low,
broken voice. He drew her to him, and their lips
met in one long kiss. Then he turned, and ran
out of the house. He did not say farewell to
Elihu, for he could not have spoken the words, if
he had tried to do so.

Ah, me! The searching pain of such a parting!
Surely, the Good Father would never have put us
on this world to live the life here, were it not that
there is a world and a life to come wherein such
partings shall never be. He hath given that the
birds of the air and the beasts of the field shall not
suffer dread of grief to come, and but little sorrow
for things gone by. Why, then, should He give it
to us, His goodliest creatures, to bear these things,
if nothing of good or evil was to come of such
suffering hereafter?



[41]




CHAPTER IV.


THESE things happened in the spring of ’13,
and the war with England was in full swing.
We thought that we knew a great deal about the
war at Eastcaster, but we really knew little or
nothing of it.

The Philadelphia stage brought down the Ledger
from that town three times a week, and Joseph
Anderson, the teacher at the Friends’ school,
would read it aloud at the “Black Horse” tavern
(it was the “Crown and Angel” then) in the
evening. A great many came to hear the news,
and it was said that the tavern did a driving business
at the time; for, of course, no one could come
and sit there all evening and drink nothing.

The folks talked with great knowledge about the
war; some of them so wisely that it was a pity that
poor President Madison did not have the chance to
hear them.

The truth of the matter was that Eastcaster was
too far away from deep water to feel the full heat
and excitement of the trouble.

The part that interested Tom the most was the
news that came now and then of the great sea[42]
battles; that being the year that the noble old
Constitution did her best fighting.

When Tom Granger came to Philadelphia, he
found matters at a very different pass from what
they were in Eastcaster, for there was talk just at
that time of Commodore Beresford sailing up the
river to bombard the town; so Tom found the
streets full of people and everything in great
fervent, as it had been for some time past.

Just outside of the town, the stage passed near
to where two regiments of militia were encamped—one
of them not far from Grey’s Ferry.

The next morning after Tom came to Philadelphia,
he called at the office of old Mr. Nicholas
Lovejoy, who was the owner of the ship in which
he had last sailed. It was the Quaker City, and
Tom had had the berth of third mate aboard her,
which was a higher grade than he had ever held up
to that time.

Mr. Lovejoy, beside being the owner of two
good ships himself, one of which, Tom had reason
to think, was then lying at the docks, had a great
deal of influence with other merchants and ship
owners. He had always been very friendly to Tom,
and had said pleasant things of him and to him more
than once, so Tom had great hopes of getting a
berth through him without much loss of time.

His wish was to ship to the West Indies, if he
could, as that did not seem so far away from home.

Mr. Lovejoy was at his desk when Tom came
into the office; a great pile of letters and papers[43]
were in front of him, which he was busy in looking
over. He shook hands cordially with the young
man and bade him be seated. Tom told him what
he wanted, and Mr. Lovejoy listened to him very
pleasantly. When he was done, the old gentleman
said frankly that there was a poor chance of his
getting any berth just then, for that no shipping
was being done, the Delaware having been
blockaded since the first of the year.

Mr. Lovejoy did not know at that time that the
blockade had been raised, for it was not until a
week or so afterward that the despatch came to
Philadelphia telling how Beresford had tried to
land for water at Lewestown, in Delaware, and not
being able to do so, had given up the whole business
as an ill piece of work and had sailed away
to the Bermudas.

Mr. Lovejoy furthermore told Tom that there
were three privateers being fitted up at the docks,
one of which was about ready to sail.

In those days there was a great deal of feeling
against privateering, and I cannot say that it was
altogether ill-grounded, for some very cloudy things
were done by certain vessels that sailed under
letters of marque.

Mr. Lovejoy was a fine looking old gentleman,
with a very red face and very white hair, which was
tied behind into a queue with a black silk ribbon.
He was never seen dressed in anything but plain
black clothes with bright silver buttons, black silk
stockings and pumps. His frilled shirt front stood[44]
out like a half moon and was stiffly starched and
as white as snow.

After Tom and he had talked a little while
together, he arose, and going to a closet in the side
of the chimney place, brought out a decanter of
fine old sherry and two glasses, both of which he
filled. Tom Granger was not fond of wine, not
from any conscientious feeling, but because that the
taste was not pleasant to him. Still, he took his
glass of wine and drank it too, for it is never well
to decline favors from men in power, like Mr.
Nicholas Lovejoy.

After the old gentleman had finished his glass of
wine, he drew out his fine cambric handkerchief
and wiped his lips.

“Tom,” said he.

“Sir,” said Tom.

“Why don’t you ship on board of a privateersman?”

“I couldn’t do it, sir,” said Tom.

“Why not?”

“Well, sir; it may sound very foolish of me to say
so, but the truth is that I don’t like the fighting.”

“Don’t like the fighting!” said Mr. Lovejoy,
raising his eyebrows. “Come, Tom, that won’t do.
Why, when that junk attacked the Quaker City
off Ceylon, there was not a man aboard that fought
like you. Captain Austin told me all about it,
though you would never do so, and I haven’t
forgotten it. And now you pretend to tell me that
you are afraid.”[45]

“No, sir,” said Tom Granger, very hot about the
ears; “it ain’t that; it’s the kind of fighting that I
don’t like. When such a junkfull of coolies as that
was came down on us, a man was bound to fight
for his own life and the lives (and more beside) of
the women aboard, and there was no great credit
to him in doing it. If the worst came to the worst,
I wouldn’t so much mind entering the navy, but I
don’t like the notion of going out to run foul of
some poor devil of a merchant captain, who,
maybe, has all of his fortune in his ship,—and
that’s the truth sir.”

“But, Tom, the navy does the same thing.”

“Yes, sir,” said Tom, “but they do it for the sake
of war, while privateers go out for their own gain
alone. I don’t see, sir, that they are so very much
better than pirates, except that they don’t do so
much murder and that the law allows them.”

At this, Mr. Lovejoy’s face began to grow a little
bit redder than usual. “Very well,” said he, getting
up and standing with his back to the fire, “suit
yourself.”

By this Tom knew that it was intended for him
to go, which he accordingly did.

Just as he got to the door, Mr. Lovejoy spoke
again: “Look’ee, Tom, you are an able seaman,—none
better. Think this matter over a little more,
and if you are inclined to go on a privateering
cruise, after all, I think that I may, perhaps, be able
to get you a place aboard of as tight a craft as
ever floated on salt water, and, maybe, a better[46]
berth than you ever had in your life before. There
are some fat pickings down toward the West Indies
just now; I shouldn’t wonder at all if, with the
berth that I think I can get you, you would clear
a thousand or twelve hundred dollars in the first
twelve months. Good morning; come to-morrow
and let me know what you decide on.” Then the
old gentleman seated himself at the desk and began
to look over his papers again, and Tom left him.

He went straight to his lodging-house (it was
the old “Ship and Anchor,” a great place for sailors
in those days), and his mind was all of a swirl and
eddy like the waters astern.

It was a nasty, drizzly, muggy day, and Tom
stood leaning on the window-sill in the bar-room,
trying to look out into the street through the
dirty, fly-specked window. The room was full of
sailors, many of them, no doubt, belonging to the
privateers that were fitting out at the docks, of
which Mr. Lovejoy had spoken. There was a
party of them playing cards at a sloppy table that
stood beside the bar. The day was so dark with
the rainy drizzle that they had a lighted candle
amongst them, so that they might be able to see
the game. The room, hazy with tobacco smoke,
was full of the noise of loud talking and the air
was reeking with the heavy smell of hot liquors.
But, Tom stood looking out of the window, with
his mind all of a toss and a tumble; for the last
words of old Nicholas Lovejoy sounded in his ears
through all the loud talking and foul words:—“I[47]
shouldn’t wonder if you would clear a thousand
or twelve hundred dollars in the first twelve
months.”

At times they sounded so clearly that he could
almost believe that they were spoken by some one
standing beside him. The more that the words
rang in his ears, the more he thought what a fool
he had been in not taking up with Mr. Lovejoy’s
half offer. Why should he be squeamish? If
every one were so, things would come to a pretty
pass, for the navy was weak—in numbers—and the
British were sending out their privateers all over
the ocean; and who was to fight them and protect
our own shipping if no one helped the navy?

So Tom argued within himself in the most
reasonable way in the world, for the temptation was
very great.

As he stood thus, looking out of the window
and seeing nothing, for his eyes were turned within
himself, some one suddenly smote him upon the
shoulder, and a voice roared in his ear, “Helloa,
Tom Granger! where are you bound?”

It was a voice that Tom Granger knew very well,
for there could be no other such in all of the world;
it made one’s ears quiver, even when it was softened
somewhat to talking. So, even before Tom turned
his head, he knew that Jack Baldwin was standing
behind him.

Jack Baldwin had been second mate of the
Quaker City on the voyage to the East Indies.

Tom Granger never saw in all his life such[48]
another man as Jack Baldwin. He stood nearly six
feet and two inches in his stockings. His hair and
beard were black and curly, and his eyes were as
black as two beads. Tom once saw him pick up
a mutinous sailor—a large and powerful man—and
shake him as you might shake a kitten. To
be sure, he was in a rage at the time. He was
better dressed than Tom had ever seen him before.
There was something of a half naval smack about
his toggery, and, altogether, he looked sleek and
prosperous,—very different from what Jack ashore
does as a rule.

Jack Baldwin saw that Tom Granger was looking
him over. “I’m on the crest of the wave now,”
said he, in his great, deep voice, grinning as he
spoke. “Look’ee, Tom,” and he fetched up a gold
eagle from out of his breeches pocket. He spun it
up into the air, and caught it in his palm again as
it fell. “There’s plenty more of the same kind
where this came from, Tom.”

“I wish that I only knew where the tree that
they grow on is to be found,” said Tom, ruefully.

“So you shall, my hearty. And do you want
me to tell you where it is?”

“Yes.”

“Tom, you’re a loon!”

“Why so? Because I want to know where the
tree grows where gold eagles may be had for the
picking?”

“You were at the place this very blessed morning,
and might have gathered a pocketful of the[49]
bright boys if you hadn’t run before a little wind as
though it was a hurricane.”

“What do you mean?” said Tom, though he
half knew without the asking.

“That I’ll tell you—here, you, bring me a glass
of hot brandy and water; will you splice, Tom?”

“Not I.”

“I bring to mind that you were always called the
Quaker aboard ship, and the name fits you well.
You will neither fight nor drink, without you have
to.”

So the grog was brought, and Jack Baldwin and
Tom Granger sat down, opposite to one another, at
a rickety deal table.

Presently Jack leaned over and laid his hand on
Tom’s arm. “Where do you think I hail from,
Tom?” said he.

“I don’t know.”

“Well, I’ll tell you: from old Nick, or old Lovejoy,
or Davy Jones,—whichever you choose to call
him. I was with him not ten minutes after you
left. He sent me after you, to hunt you up; so I
came straight here, like a hot shot, for I knew I’d
find you in the old place. Sure enough, I’ve found
you, and here we are,—shipmates both.”

“And what did you want of me?”

“That I’ll tell you. Tom,”—here he lowered
his voice to a deep rumble—“have you seen the
Nancy Hazlewood?”

“No.”

“Well I’ll show her to you after a bit. She is[50]
lying in the river, just below Smith’s Island. She’s
the new privateer.”

Tom’s heart beat more quickly, but he only said,
“Is she?”

“Who do you think’s the owner, Tom?”

“How should I know?”

“Old Lovejoy!” Here Jack raised his glass of
grog, and took a long pull at it, looking over the
rim at Tom all the while. Tom was looking down,
picking hard at the corner of the table.

“I don’t see that this is any concern of mine,”
he said, in a low voice.

“Don’t you? Well, I’ll tell you what concern it
is of yours; I’m to be first mate, and I want you to
be second,—and now the murder’s out!”

Tom shook his head, but he said nothing.

Jack Baldwin slid his palm down, until it rested
on the back of Tom’s hand. “Look’ee, Tom
Granger,” said he, roughly; “I like you. We’ve
been messmates more than once, and I don’t forget
how you kept that yellow coolie devil from jabbing
his d—d snickershee into my back, over off Ceylon.
There’s no man in all the world that I’d as soon
have for a shipmate as you. Old Lovejoy, too;—he
says that he must have you. He knows very
well that there isn’t a better seaman living than
the one that stands in Tom Granger’s shoes.
Don’t be a fool! Go to the old man, name your
own figure, for he’ll close with you at any reasonable
terms.”

So Jack talked and talked, and Tom listened and[51]
listened, and the upshot of it was that he promised
to go and see old Mr. Lovejoy again the next
morning.

You may easily guess how it all turned out, for
when a man not only finds that he is in temptation,
but is willing to be there, he is pretty sure to end
by doing that which he knows is not right.

So Tom drank another glass of Mr. Lovejoy’s
fine old sherry, the old gentleman offered liberal
terms, and the end of the matter was that Tom
promised to enter as second mate of the Nancy
Hazlewood, privateersman.

Tom Granger has always felt heartily ashamed of
himself because of the way that he acted in this
matter. It is not that privateering was so bad; I
pass no judgment on that, and I know that there
were many good men in that branch of the service.

I have always held that a man is not necessarily
wicked because he does a bad action; he may not
know that it is bad, and then, surely, no blame can
be laid to his account. But when he feels that a
thing is evil, he is wrong in doing it, whether it is
evil or not.

Jack Baldwin did nothing wrong in going on this
privateering cruise, for he saw nothing wrong in it,
but Tom Granger thought that it was wrong, and
yet did it; therefore he has always felt ashamed of
himself.

In looking back, after all these years, it is hard
to guess what he expected would be the end of the
matter. If he had come back in a year’s time,—which[52]
he did not do,—and if he had brought home
a thousand dollars of prize money from a privateering
cruise, I am very much inclined to think
that Elihu Penrose would hardly have judged that
it had been fairly earned.

Friends were very much more strict in their
testimony against war then than they are now.
Numbers of young men went from here during the
rebellion, and nothing was thought of it. I myself
had a grandson in the navy;—he is a captain now.

As I said, Elihu Penrose would hardly have
fancied Tom Granger’s way of earning money, if it
had been won in that way; as for what Patty would
have said and done,—I do not like to think of it.

However, it is no use trying to guess at the color
of the chicks that addled eggs might have hatched
out, so I will push on with my story, and tell how
the Nancy Hazlewood put to sea, and what befell
her there.



[53]




CHAPTER V.


THE Nancy Hazlewood put to sea on a Friday.
Tom Granger was not over fanciful in the
matter of signs and omens; nevertheless, he always
had a nasty feeling about sailing on that day; he
might reason with himself that it was foolish, but
the feeling was there, and was not to be done away
with. The only other time that he had sailed on a
Friday, was in the barque Manhattan (Captain
Nathan J. Wild), bound for Nassau, with a cargo of
wheat. About a week afterward, she put back into
New York harbor again, and not a day too soon,
either. Captain Granger has often told the tale of
this short cruise, so I will not tell it over again, as
it has nothing to do with this story, except to show
why it was that Tom Granger always had an
ill-feeling about sailing on Friday.

As a matter of fact, there was a greater and a
better reason to feel worried than on account of
this, for the truth was, that the Nancy Hazlewood
put to sea fully ten days before she should have
done so, and from that arose most of the trouble.

The blame in the matter belonged no more to
one than to another, for all thought that it was for[54]
the best to weigh anchor when they did; nevertheless,
it was a mistake, and a very sad mistake.

There never was any wish to cast a slur on the
memory of Captain Knight, in the account of the
matter that was afterward published, for no one
ever said, to my knowledge, that he was anything
else than a good seaman, and knew his business.
But certainly, his headstrong wilfulness in the
matter of the troubles that befell the ship was, to
say the least, very blameworthy.

Tom saw nothing of Captain Knight until the
day before the ship sailed. Indeed, the captain had
not been in town, so far as he knew. This had
troubled him. He had said nothing about it, but it
had troubled him.

About noon on Thursday, the day before the
ship sailed, Tom came to Lovejoy’s dock, where he
was overseeing the lading of some stores. One of
the clerks at the dock told him that Captain Knight
had been aboard of the ship, and also that he had
wanted to see him, and had waited for him some
time, but had gone about fifteen minutes before.
A little while afterward Mr. Whimple, Mr. Lovejoy’s
head-clerk, came to him and asked him to
step up to the office, as Captain Knight and Mr.
Lovejoy were there, and wanted to speak to him.

Captain Knight was standing in front of the fire,
talking with Mr. Lovejoy, when Tom came into
the office. He shook hands very heartily when
Mr. Lovejoy made them acquainted, and said some
kind things to Tom—that he had no doubt but[55]
that their intercourse would be pleasant; at least,
he hoped so (smiling), for, from that which he had
heard of Tom, he felt that it would be his own fault
if it were not. He said that he was sorry that he
had not been on hand to oversee matters, as he
should have done, although he knew that these
things could be in no better hands; that his mother
had been so sick that she had not been expected to
live, and that it had not been possible for him to
come on from Connecticut sooner.

Tom felt relieved to find that Captain Knight
had such a good reason for not having been on
hand to see to the proper lading of his vessel. He
also gathered from this speech that the captain was
a Yankee, which he had not known before. Jack
Baldwin told him afterward that he hailed from
New London, and had the name of being a very
good sailor and a great fighter.

He was quite a young man, a little older than
Tom, perhaps, but hardly as old as Jack Baldwin.
He was a fine gentlemanly fellow, and looked not
unlike a picture of Commodore Decatur that Tom
had seen in the window of a print shop in Walnut
street, though Knight was the younger man.

After a short time Jack Baldwin came into the
office; Captain Knight and he spoke to one
another, for they had met before.

Presently, as they all stood talking together, Mr.
Lovejoy asked of a sudden whether it would be
possible, at a pinch, to weigh anchor the next
day.[56]

Tom was struck all aback at this, and could
hardly believe that he heard aright.

“I should think,” said Captain Knight, “that it
might be done;” and, from the way in which he
spoke, Tom could see that he and Mr. Lovejoy had
already talked the matter over and had pretty well
settled it between themselves.

“What do you think, Mr. Baldwin,” said old Mr.
Lovejoy, and all looked at Jack for an answer.

“I think, sir,” said Jack, in his rough way, “I
think, sir, as Captain Knight says, that it might be
done. A man might cruise from here to Cochin
China, in a dory, provided that he had enough
hard-tack and water aboard. If he met a gale,
though, he would be pretty sure to go to the
bottom,—and so should we.”

Tom could easily see that Captain Knight was
touched at the way in which Jack had spoken, as
well he might be. It was, however, Jack’s usual
way of speaking, and it is not likely that he meant
anything by it.

“What do you think, Mr. Granger?” said
Captain Knight, turning quickly to Tom, with a
little red spot burning in each cheek.

Tom was sorry that he was brought into the
matter, for he saw, as has been said, that Captain
Knight was touched, and he did not want to
say anything to gall him further. However, he
answered, as he was asked: “I am afraid, sir,” said
he, smiling, “that it may perhaps be a little risky
to weigh anchor just yet.” Of course, he could[57]
not explain when it was not asked of him to do so,
but he knew that it would take fully ten days, if
not two weeks, to get the Nancy Hazlewood into
anything like fit sailing trim. Not only were the
decks hampered up with a mass of stores of all
kinds (for it had been necessary to crowd them
aboard in a great hurry), but no start had been
made at drawing out watch, quarter and station
bills. Tom could not help thinking that if Captain
Knight had been on hand during the past week, he
never would have given it as his opinion that the
vessel was fit to sail,—even on a pinch.

When Tom gave his answer, Captain Knight
turned hastily away to the fire-place, and began in
a nervous sort of a way to finger a letter-stamp that
lay on the mantle-shelf. Any one could see that
he was very much irritated; but in a few moments
he turned around again, and seemed quiet enough,
only that the red still burned in his cheeks. Mr.
Lovejoy tried to throw oil on the troubled water.

“Mr. Granger,” said he, resting his hand ever so
lightly on Tom’s arm for a moment, “Mr. Granger
has had a great deal to do this past week, and
maybe (smiling) the overpress of work makes him
think that there is more yet to be done than there
really is. I wouldn’t,” said he, taking up a letter
from his desk, “I wouldn’t think for a moment, and
neither would Captain Knight, of letting the Hazlewood
leave her anchorage just now, if it were not
for this packet, which was sent to me this morning,
about half-past ten o’clock.”[58]

Here he handed the packet to Jack Baldwin, who
read it, and then passed it to Tom without a word.
It was the news that Beresford had lifted the
blockade of the Delaware.

“You see,” said Mr. Lovejoy, “here is a good
chance of getting away. There is no knowing how
soon John Bull will shut the door again, and then,
here we’ll be penned up for six months, or more,
perhaps.”

Then Captain Knight spoke again. He said that
while the ship might not be in fit trim for sailing
in an ordinary case, some risks must be run with
her, for risks, greater or less, must always be taken
in this sort of service. He said that he proposed
to run for the Capes, and put into Lewes Harbor
if the weather seemed likely to be heavy. They
could get in proper trim there just as easily as they
could in Philadelphia. He also said that, being
just inside of the Capes, they would not only have
good harborage, but could either slip out to sea
or run up the bay, in case that any of the enemy’s
cruisers should appear in the offing. Another
great advantage was that they would be this much
further on their cruise, and, if the weather turned
out well, could take their chances and run for Key
West, even if the ship were not in the best of order.

“I know,” said he, “that both Mr. Baldwin and
Mr. Granger have been bred to caution in the
merchant service, where cargoes and storage are
almost the first things to consider, but” (here he
looked straight at Jack), “one must have some[59]
courage in the sort of service that we are about to
enter upon, for a lack of that is almost as great a
fault as poor seamanship.”

There was a great deal of reason in the first part
of this speech, and Tom could not help seeing it,
though for all that he was troubled at the step
which they seemed about to take. As for what
was last said, he felt that it was most uncalled for,
for he knew that Jack Baldwin was as brave as any
man living; nor was he, I think, a coward.

Jack was very angry. He said that if any occasion
should arise, he hoped to show Captain Knight
that he would dare to do as much as any man that
ever walked a deck-plank, no matter whom he
might be; that he would say no more about lying
in port, and was now willing to sail at any time—the
sooner the better.

Poor old Mr. Lovejoy was very much troubled
at the ill feeling between the two men. He talked
to both very kindly until, after a while, the trouble
seemed to clear away somewhat, and things went
more smoothly.

At last it was settled that if the wind held to the
northward (it had been blowing from that quarter
for the last two days) they should weigh anchor
at three o’clock in the afternoon, so as to take
advantage of the ebb tide, and run down as far as
Lewestown harbor at least.

“What do you say to all this, Tom?” said Jack,
as the two walked down to the dock together.

“I say nothing, Jack.”[60]

“It seems to me that you never do say anything,”
said Jack, “but I say something; I say that we are
all a pack of lubberly fools, and that the worst one
amongst us is that walking sea dandy, for he ought
to know better.”

Tom could not but agree with a part of this
speech, but he made no answer, for it could do
no good.

The anchor was weighed at three o’clock the
next day as had been fixed upon, and they ran
down the river with the wind E. N. E. and an ebb
tide to help them along; and so began the cruise
of the Nancy Hazlewood.

All this may seem to be spun out somewhat over
long, but I tell it to you that you may see just why
the Nancy Hazlewood sailed when she did, which
was ten days before she should have done. The
day of sailing was Friday, the 20th of April, 1813.

Tom wrote a letter to Patty Penrose on the
evening before he sailed. It was a long letter and
he told her many things, but he did not tell her
that the vessel in which he had sailed as second
mate was a privateersman.

It may be well that the Nancy Hazlewood should
be described, that you may have a notion of the
craft in which Tom Granger went upon his first
and last privateering cruise. She was a full-rigged
ship of five hundred and fifty tons, and, though so
small, had a poop and a top-gallant forecastle.

Tom had rarely seen a vessel with handsomer
lines.[61]

She was evidently intended for great speed,
though, in his judgment, she was rather heavily
sparred for a vessel of her size. It afterward proved
that she was so. She carried eight thirty-two
pound carronades on the main deck, and two long
twelves, one on the forecastle and one on the poop;
and about one hundred men. Altogether, though
not so heavily armed as the Dolphin or Comet of
Baltimore, she was one of the most substantial as
well as one of the swiftest privateersmen that ever
left any port of the country during the war.

As a rule, privateersmen were swift-sailing brigs
or schooners, heavily armed and manned, and
depending largely upon their prizes for provisions;
but the Nancy Hazlewood was fitted out almost as
completely as though she were in the regular
service.

All that night and during Saturday the 21st it
blew heavily from the N. E. On Saturday evening,
however, the weather broke and there seemed a
prospect of its being clear the next day. On
Sunday forenoon at two bells the Nancy Hazlewood
was nearly abreast of Lewestown harbor. Captain
Knight was on the poop at the time, and he gave
orders to Tom, who was the officer of the deck,
that a craft should be signaled to take off the
pilot.

Tom was struck all aback at this; it was the first
hint that he had had that Captain Knight did not
intend to put into Lewestown harbor after all. It
was in rather an uncomfortable state of mind that[62]
he gave the needful orders, had the jack run up
at the fore and the vessel hove to.

Captain Knight stood beside Tom, his hands
clasped behind him, watching the pilot boat as it
presently hoisted sail and bore down under the
lee quarter. What his feelings were cannot be told;
Tom’s were uncomfortable enough, as has been said.
He knew that Captain Knight must have had good
and sufficient reason for that which he was about
to do; nevertheless, his heart sank as he cast his
eyes around and saw the confusion everywhere;
the deck littered with all sort of gear and hamper.
There is an old saying that a vessel is never ready
for sea until a week after leaving port. Tom
thought that the Nancy Hazlewood was at least
three weeks behind time.

Presently Jack Baldwin came up from below.
He cast his eyes quickly aloft, and then he looked
at the pilot boat, which was now close under the
lee quarter.

Tom could see that he took it all in in a moment.

He came straight across the deck to where
Captain Knight and Tom Granger were standing,
and touched his hat to the captain.

“Captain Knight,” said he.

“Sir?” said the captain, turning quickly upon
him.

“The understanding was that we were to put into
Lewes Harbor, for a time; at least, so I understood
it. May I ask if you intend to put to sea, after all?”

Tom stood aghast. He had never heard an officer[63]
speak to his captain in such a way in all his life
before. There was no better seaman afloat than
Jack Baldwin, and it must have been a serious case,
in his opinion, that would excuse him in so
addressing his commanding officer.

As for Captain Knight, he grew white to the lips.

He spoke in a low tone, and very slowly, but his
voice trembled with the weight of his anger. “Mr.
Baldwin,” said he, “I don’t know where you have
sailed, or what discipline you have seen, that has
taught you to allow yourself to question your
captain’s intentions to your captain’s self. Understand
me, sir, once and for all: I am the chief
officer of this ship, and I will not have you, nor
any man aboard, question me. You hear me?
That will do, sir; go to your room.”

The two men looked at one another for a
moment. Tom held his breath, expecting to hear
Jack blaze out with something that would get him
into more trouble than ever. However, he said
nothing, but swung on his heel and went below.

Captain Knight stood beside Tom, in silence, his
breath coming and going quickly; suddenly, he too
turned and walked hastily to the cabin, banging the
door behind him.

Tom leaned on the rail, sick at heart; he felt
miserable about the whole matter. Here he was,
embarked on a cruise for which he had no liking,
in the stormy season of the year, in a ship which
he believed to be unfit for sailing, with a crew that
had no discipline, and the captain and the first mate[64]
at loggerheads before they were out of harbor. He
would have given an eye to be safe ashore again.

And yet, that Sunday morning was not a day to
breed troubled thoughts. Tom had rarely seen a
lovelier one; the air seemed more like June than
April. The last few days of rain had washed the
air until it was as clear as crystal. One could see
every window pane in the little town of Lewes.
There was a sentry walking up and down on the
newly-made earthworks in front of the town, and at
every turn that he took at the end of his beat, his
bayonet flashed like a star. The ship rose and fell
lazily on the heaving of the ground swell that
rolled in around the Capes. Down to the southward
the white sands stretched away into the
looming of the distance, rimmed with a whiter line
of foam until all was lost in the misty haze cast up
by the tumbling surf.

The pilot boat had now run up near to them,
and was launching a dory from her deck. Tom
stood leaning on the rail, looking at her, and
presently the pilot came and stood beside him. He
was a short, powerful man, bull-necked and long-armed.
A shock of hair and a grizzled beard
seemed to make a sort of frame around his face.
Even he felt uncomfortable at that which had just
passed.

“A nasty row, wasn’t it, sir?” said he to Tom,
jerking his head toward the captain’s cabin.

Tom made no answer; in fact, he did not look
at the man, for it was none of the fellow’s business.[65]

Presently the dory came alongside, and the pilot
slid down the man-ropes and stepped cleverly into
her.

By noon the Nancy Hazlewood had dropped
Cape May astern. The captain had sent for Jack
to come upon deck again, to take his watch at
eight bells. Captain Knight had directed her
course to be laid S. E. by E., by which Tom supposed
that he intended to run well out, so as to
escape the chance of falling in with any of the
British cruisers that were at that time hanging
about the coast, more especially off the mouth of
the Chesapeake. The wind was nearly astern,
every inch of cloth was spread, and the way in
which the Nancy Hazlewood boomed along showed
Tom Granger that he had not overrated her sailing
qualities. The log showed that she was running at
a little over eleven knots.

All of the afternoon Tom was in the forward
part of the vessel, looking to the clearing away of a
lot of stores, for they were getting things to rights
as well as they could, and taking advantage of the
fair weather to do it.

And it was very needful, too, for, beside spare
suits of sails and spars, lashed to nothing, there
was a great litter of miscellaneous stores,—barrels
of salt pork, junk, hard-tack, and flour, kegs,
chests, crates, yeoman’s and purser’s stores, and a
hundred and one things—too many to tell of.

Tom could not help wondering, as he looked at
this mass of stores, what they should do if it[66]
should be needful to man the guns for a fight, or
work the ship in a sudden squall. However, no
craft of any sort was in sight, and there was no
sign of foul weather.

One of the worst features of the whole matter
was the slowness with which they got along with
the business of clearing up all this hamper; the
work seemed to gather on them instead of growing
less.

About the middle of the afternoon, Jack came to
where Tom stood overseeing the men at this work.
He stood beside him for some time without saying
a word, looking moodily at them. Presently he
spoke all of a sudden: “What do you say to it all,
Tom?”

“I have nothing to say, Jack,” said Tom.

“You may have nothing to say,” said Jack, “but
I have. Mark my words, Tom, if we’re caught in
any sort of heavy weather we’ll founder as sure as
my name’s Jack Baldwin!” So saying, he turned
on his heel and walked quickly away. Tom could
easily see that Jack felt touched at him because he
did not show more feeling in the matter. But
though Tom did not show it, his thoughts were
uncomfortable enough in all conscience.

That day (the twenty-second), was as good a day
as one could have wished for, and so was the next,—and
that was the last, for then the trouble began.



[67]




CHAPTER VI.


SO the 23d was the last fair day that they had on
that short cruise. During the forenoon the
wind held from nearly the same quarter—that is,
northerly and westerly.

The air was mild and pleasant; the day, like the
day before, seemed more like June than the middle
of April.

Toward noon, however, the wind shifted around
to the southward and eastward, and the glass had a
downward bearing. Tom saw, with a troubled
feeling, that the weather began to take an ugly sort
of a look. About nine o’clock Captain Knight gave
orders to have the vessel’s course altered to nearly
due south.

At noon the observation showed their position to
be about 35° 40′ north, by 71° west, with Hatteras
about 210 miles distant, W. by S. on the starboard
beam.

A little before eight bells, Captain Knight came
up on deck again, and Tom, feeling anxious himself,
looked out of the corners of his eyes, to see
if he could gather what the captain thought of
the situation. It seemed to Tom that he was not[68]
quite easy in his mind. He cast his eyes aloft, and
then looked around. He took a turn or two up
and down the deck, and then looked at the glass,
which, as had been said, was falling. Whatever he
might have thought about the looks of things, he
said nothing. Tom had half expected an order to
shorten sail, but Captain Knight gave none such,
and presently went to his cabin again.

Shortly after noon the wind was blowing from
the northeast. It became a great deal colder, and
by four o’clock the sky was overcast by a gathering
haze, which, at last, shut out the sun altogether.

About this time they fell in with shifting banks
of fog, blowing before the wind, the like of which
Tom had never seen before. They seemed to drift
in belts, and were no doubt raised by cold currents
of air, for a chill could be felt the minute the ship
would run into one of them. Every now and then
the wind would sweep these banks away, rolling
them up before it, and for a little while there would
be a clear space around the ship for maybe a
couple of miles or more.

At that time they were under all plain sail to
top gallant sails, and were booming along at a rate
that could not have been less than ten knots. Tom
thought that the Nancy Hazlewood might even
have done better than she was then doing, were it
not that she labored in a most unusual way for a
vessel, in a wind no heavier than that in which she
was then sailing. There is no doubt that this came
from the heaviness of her spars as well as the ill[69]
stowage of her provisions and stores; still she was
doing well, and any one could see with half an eye
that it would be an uncommonly swift cruiser to
whom the Nancy Hazlewood would not be able to
show a clean pair of heels, if the need should arise
for her doing so.

It was a little before the middle of the first dog
watch, when there happened one of the closest
misses that Tom ever had of losing his life. I most
firmly believe that if any one beside Jack Baldwin
had been the officer of the deck, Tom Granger’s
story would never have had to have been told.

Jack was walking up and down on the poop in a
restless sort of a way. It was plain that he was
anxious at the fog, as well he might be. At one
time the ship would be surging away across what
seemed to be a lake, with dull banks of snow all
around, at another she would plunge headforemost
into whirling clouds of mist, so thick that the
leaden sea alongside could barely be seen; heaving
as though it were something alive, and the fog was
smothering it.

Jack came to the break of the poop and looked
over to where Tom was standing, on the deck
below. His black hair and beard were covered
with the dampness, so that he looked as though he
had turned gray.

“Tom,” said he, “I wish you’d slip foreward and
see that those men are keeping a bright lookout
ahead. Keep your weather eye lifted too, Tom, till
we’re out of the worst of this infernally thick fog.”[70]

So Tom went foreward, as Jack had asked him
to do, and found that the two men who had been
placed there since they had run into the fog were
keeping as sharp a lookout as could be wished for.

Just as Tom climbed up on the forecastle, they
surged out into a clear space, that was maybe two
miles or two miles and a quarter from side to side.

They had run pretty nearly across this stretch,
and I recollect that Tom was just lighting his pipe
under the lee of the foremast. As he raised his
head and looked over the port bow, he saw a sight
that made the blood stand still in his veins.

It was a man-of-war in full sail, looming up like a
mountain.

It came out of the fog so suddenly, that it
seemed as though the mist had taken form from
itself. It was bearing straight down across the port
bow of the Nancy Hazlewood, plunging forward as
solemnly as death. It could not have been more
than six or seven ships’ lengths distant, and the
great sails bellying out like big clouds, shadowed
over the Nancy Hazlewood as she might have
shadowed over a fishing smack.

Ten seconds more and she would have been
down upon them, and would have crushed the little
craft as though she had been made of paper.
There was a moment of silence as great as though
every man aboard of the Nancy Hazlewood had
been turned to stone. I remember that Tom
Granger stood with his newly-lighted pipe in his
hand, never moving a hair.[71]

The silence was only for an instant, though, for
the next moment a voice roared like a trumpet:

“Hard a starboard! Let go, head sheets and
lee head braces!”

It was Jack Baldwin’s voice, and never did Tom
hear it ring as it did at that moment. It not only
was heard through the ship, but it pealed through
it like a clap of thunder. Those below came
tumbling up helter-skelter, and the captain came
running out of his cabin, for there was a ring in
Jack’s voice that told every man aboard of the ship
that great danger was down upon them. It seemed
to break the stillness around just as a stone dropped
into a well might break the stillness below. In an
instant the braces were flung from the belaying-pins,
and the ship came up toward the wind without
a second to lose. Before those aboard of the
frigate had gathered their wits she had passed
alongside, and so close that a child could easily
have pitched a biscuit aboard of the Nancy Hazlewood
from the decks that loomed twenty feet above
her.

The whole thing was over in a dozen seconds,
but those dozen seconds are stamped on Tom
Granger’s mind as clearly as though they were
chiseled in marble. Even now, though he is over
eighty years old, he can see that great frigate rising
higher and higher as she surges forward, towering
over the little ship, while a hundred faces pop up
above the rail and stare down upon her decks. It
was only a moment—a thread of time—on which[72]
hung the chance as to whether she would clear or
not. There was a thunderous roar of the waters
under the bow, flung back in an echo from the
wooden walls of the frigate; there was a vision of
open ports rushing by, and of scared faces crowded
at them, in spite of discipline; then the frigate was
astern and the danger gone past with her. But in
that short moment of passing they saw enough to
make them know that she was a British cruiser.

I say again that if Jack Baldwin had not had the
deck at that time there would never have been any
story to tell of Tom Granger, for if Jack had hesitated
only so much as two seconds, as I am afraid
that Tom would have done in his case, the Nancy
Hazlewood would have been run down just as sure
as that there is a sun in the heavens.

So the danger went by, and all was over in a
quarter of the time that it takes to tell it. The
head-yards were braced up, the head-sheets were
gathered aft, the Nancy Hazlewood stood away on
her course again, and the next moment plunged
into the fog and was gone.

But, in the meantime, they had wakened up
aboard of the frigate, and just as the Nancy Hazlewood
ran into the bank they heard an order
shouted aboard of the man-of-war, sounding faint
because of the distance that the two vessels had
now run:

“Weather head, and main; lee cro’ jack braces!”

That meant that the frigate was about to wear,
follow down in their wake and do that which she[73]
had so nearly missed doing a minute before—finish
up the Yankee.

Tom came aft, and, though he would have felt
like knocking the man down that would have said
so at the time, his hands were cold and trembling
nervously. For the matter of that, Jack Baldwin’s
face was whiter than it was used to be. “A close
shave, sir,” said he to Captain Knight, who stood
beside him; but there was a nervous tremor in his
voice in spite of the boldness that he assumed.
Indeed, the only perfectly cool man aboard was
Captain Knight. He stood looking aft, as though
he would pierce the fog and make out what the
vessel astern of him was about.

Presently he turned to Jack. “Did you not
understand from that order that he was about to
ware ship, Mr. Baldwin?” said he.

“I think that I understood them to give such an
order, sir,” said Jack.

Captain Knight drew out his snuff box and took
a pinch of snuff. “I understood it so,” said he,
shutting the lid of the box with a snap and sliding it
into his pocket again. He stood for about a couple
of minutes looking, now up at the sails and now
straight ahead; presently he turned to Jack again.

“Bring her by the wind on the starboard tack,
Mr. Baldwin,” said he. “We’ll slip out of this
neighborhood on somewhat the same course that
the Englishman held a few minutes ago, and leave
him groping about here in this infernal blindness
for us.”[74]

It seemed to Tom that Captain Knight had done
a wise thing in taking the course that he did to get
away from the Englishman. If the fog should lift,
and they should find that the frigate had the
weather gauge, they might get into a nasty pickle,
whereas this course would give them the weather
gauge and every chance to get away.

After a while Captain Knight told Jack to set
the fore-topmast stay sail, and then, after some
hesitation, to set the royals. It was quite plain
that he had made up his mind to crack on sail, so
as to gain as much to the windward of the frigate
as he could.

The Nancy Hazlewood was now sailing close-hauled,
and was as pretty a sight as one could wish
to see. The wind was blowing stiffly, as it had
done for some time. It had not increased to any
account, though the scud was beginning to fly
across the sky, and there was every prospect of its
blowing heavily before morning. So the Nancy
Hazlewood went bowling along on this wind, her
bows every now and then flinging a roaring sea
from her in an ocean of foam. She was careened
over so that the sea eddied around the lee scuppers,
and her copper bottom showed red in the green
waters. On she went, bouncing from sea to sea, as
a ball bounces when it is rolled across the ground.
The top-gallant masts were bent like a bow, and
the weather backstays were as taut as the bow-string,
those on the lee bowing out gracefully before
the wind. The cloud of sails were bellied big and[75]
round, and were as hard as iron, and altogether, as
was said, the Nancy Hazlewood was as pretty a
sight as one could wish to see.

About two bells in the first watch Captain Knight
gave orders that the ship should be put about, and
running two points free on the starboard tack,
stood off to the S.E.

This, as has been said, was one of the narrowest
shaves that Tom Granger ever had for his life, and
as long as he shall remember anything he will
never forget that half-minute when the British
frigate was coming down upon them under full sail,
with death at the helm.



[76]




CHAPTER VII.


THE next morning, when Tom came upon deck,
he found that the wind had increased to half
a gale. It was a dreary sight. The sky was heavy
and leaden, and the sea was like liquid lead, for,
when the sky is dull, like it was that morning, it
seems as though one could almost walk over the
surface of the ocean, so hard does it look, and so
lacking of depth, excepting where the crest of the
wave sharpens just before it breaks.

The Nancy Hazlewood showed that she was a
very wet ship, for her decks were covered with
water, that ran swashing from side to side. She
would roll well over on her side, like a log, and
scoop in the top of a wave, that would rush backward
and forward across the deck until it had run
out of the scupper holes; but before it was fairly
gone another sea would come, so that the decks
were never free of water. Not only was the ship
laboring strangely, but she was yawing so that two
men at the wheel could hardly keep her to her
course.

Jack was standing on the poop, anxious and
troubled. Tom stood beside him, but neither of[77]
them spoke for a while, both being sunk in deep
thought.

“Tom,” said Jack, at last, in a low voice, “I’ve
sailed in a many ships in my time, but I never saw
one behave like this. She bothers me; I don’t
know what to make of her.” He paused for a
moment, and then he clapped his hand to his thigh.
“D—n it,” said he, “she ain’t either equipped or
stowed in a fit way. She ought never to have put
out from Lewestown Harbor in her condition, and,
without I’m much mistaken, we’ll find that out
long before we reach Key West.”

Then he turned over the orders and went below
to get his breakfast, leaving Tom in charge of the
deck.

The day passed without especial event, and that
night at the mid-watch Tom turned in to get a little
sleep. It seemed to him that he had hardly closed
his eyes when he was aroused by the sound of the
boatswain’s voice ringing, as it were, in his very
ears:

“All hands reef topsails!”

Tom tumbled out of his bunk and stood on the
cabin floor. There was a noise of pounding and
grinding alongside, and the decks were careened,
so that the first thought that occurred to him was
that the ship was foundering. He ran up on deck
without stopping a moment, for there was a vibration
in the boatswain’s voice that told him that
something serious had befallen.

The gale had increased with a sudden and heavy[78]
squall, and the maintop-gallant-mast had gone by
the board. It was hanging alongside, a tangled
wreck, and it was the thumping and grinding of
this that Tom had heard when he had first opened
his eyes. A dozen men were at work cutting away
the wreck, and Tom jumped to help them. At
last it drifted away astern, a tangled mass on the
surface of grey foam.

All around them were seas, ten or fifteen feet
high, shining with phosphorescent crests, moving
solemnly forward with their black weight of thousands
of tons of solid water. Amongst these the
little ship labored like a living thing in pain. The
men ran up aloft, and Jack, trumpet to mouth,
bellowed orders that rang above all the thunder of
the gale. Presently the sails were clapping and
thundering in the darkness above, as the men
wrestled with them. Now and then voices were to
be heard through all the roaring of the waters and
the howling of the wind: “Haul out to windward!”
and “Light out to leeward!”—an uproar of noises
that one never hears excepting on shipboard, and
at such a time.

Day broke with the storm blowing as furiously
as ever. Tom was officer of the deck, when, about
ten o’clock, Maul, the carpenter, came aft to where
he was standing. He was a fine-looking fellow,
broad-shouldered and deep-chested. He chucked
his thumb up to his forehead, and, shifting the quid
of tobacco from one cheek to the other, told Tom
that which sent a thrill shivering through him:[79]

“Ten inches of water in the well, sir.”

The pumps sucked at five inches, so the Nancy
Hazlewood had made five inches of water in the
last hour.

“I was afraid it would come,” said Tom to himself,
and then he went and reported it to the
captain, for, though the leak was not of much
account as regarded size, it was as dangerous as it
was sudden.

“Man the pumps, sir,” was all that the captain
said.

Before very long the pumps sucked, and the men
gave a cheer. So far all was well enough. But an
hour afterward the carpenter came aft and reported
that there was a little less than thirteen inches of
water in the well. Captain Knight, and Tom, and
Jack were standing near together on the poop at
the time.

“Man the pumps,” was all that the captain said,
and then he moved away.

“Jack,” said Tom, in a low voice, “this looks
ugly.”

“You’re right; it does,” said Jack.

There was a cold, dull rain blowing slantwise
across the ocean at that time, which shut in everything
to within a mile or two of the ship. The
gale had moderated but little, but now, through all
the roaring, you could hear the regular thump,
thump of the pumps, where two lines of men were
working at the brakes. Every now and then the
sound of the pumping would stop with the sucking[80]
of water, but presently it would begin again—thump!
thump! thump! thump! When evening
came the sound was unceasing, for at that time
they were not pumping the water out of the ship as
fast as she was making it.

The last thing that Tom heard that night was
the continuous thumping, and it was the first thing
that met his ears when he opened his eyes again.
He went up on deck, and when he looked around
him his heart fell within him. Half of the maintop-sail
was blown away, the shreds standing straight
out with the force of the wind. There was a great
deal of water on the deck—perhaps never less than
three feet on the lee side.

She was not taking much water over the weather
rail, but she would take it to leeward, and then roll
to windward, and the sea would go rushing across
the deck, carrying everything before it.

That afternoon he stood on the poop deck
looking over the side of the vessel. She was
rolling with a dull, heavy motion from side to side;
it was just such a motion as a log in a mill pond
will take if you give it a push with your foot. He
looked first astern, and then forward, and he saw
that the stern was deeper in the water than the
bows. Just then he felt a hand on his shoulder;
he looked up and saw that it was Jack Baldwin.

“Tom,” said he, in a low voice.

“What is it, Jack?”

“I’ve been looking too; do you know that the
ship’s foundering?”[81]

Tom nodded his head, for he did not feel like
speaking.

“Tom,” said Jack, after a moment of silence;
“what do you suppose is the reason that Captain
Knight don’t give orders to have the boats cleared
away, ready for lowering.”

“Perhaps he don’t think it’s time; the ship’ll
last a good while longer yet, Jack.”

“Do you think that’s his reason, Tom?” said Jack.

Tom did not answer.

“I see you don’t. Look here, Tom; do you
want to know what I’m beginning to think? It’s
this,—that he don’t intend to let a man leave this
ship, if he can’t bring her to Key West!”

“For God’s sake, don’t breathe a word of that in
the men’s hearing, Jack. You can’t believe what
you say.”

“What did Captain Sedgwick do last November?”

Tom did not answer; he knew that story only
too well. Captain Sedgwick, of the privateersman
Mirabel, had fallen in with a British cruiser off
Barnegat; had been crippled by her, and had blown
up his ship and all hands on board, so that she
might not fall into the Englishman’s hands. Three
men out of one hundred and eighteen had come off
with their lives.

“For heaven’s sake, Jack, don’t breathe a word
of this to the crew!” said Tom again, and then he
turned away.

As the day wore along, things looked more and
more gloomy.[82]

About three o’clock in the afternoon a sound fell
on their ears, that thrilled through every man on
board. It was the voice of the lookout, roaring,—“Sail
ho!”

“Where away?” sang out Jack.

“Two points on the port bow,” came the answer.

Most of the crew ran to the side of the vessel, as
did the men at the brakes. Tom did not order
them back, for he saw that there would be no use
in doing so.

As the day had worn along, the discipline of the
ship had begun to go pretty much to pieces, and
there had been great difficulty in keeping the men
at the brakes. I think that they, like Jack and
Tom, had gotten a notion that the ship was
doomed, for, though they worked when they were
ordered, it was in a dull, stolid way, as though they
had no interest in it one way or another. Tom
had tried to do all that lay in him to keep them
going, and I think that it was only through his
urging that they were kept at it at all.

So now they all left the pumps and ran to the
side of the vessel to get a look at the sail.

At first it was seen like a flickering speck in the
dull, grey distance, but it presently rose higher and
higher as the Nancy Hazlewood held on her course.
Jack Baldwin was on the poop when the vessel was
first sighted; he did not lose a moment, but went
straightway and reported it to the captain, who
presently came upon deck from his cabin. He had
wound a red scarf about his waist, and had thrust[83]
a brace of large pistols in it. There was an odd
look about him, that at first led Tom to think that
he had been drinking, but he soon found that
he was wrong. Whatever it was that had led
him to rig himself up in this style, it was not
drink.

He stood silently with the glass at his eye,
looking at the distant sail that the Nancy Hazlewood
was slowly raising above the horizon. He did not
seem to notice that the men had left the pumps; at
least he made no remark upon it. Minute after
minute passed, until at last the hull of the vessel
hove in sight and showed her to be a large barque—apparently,
from the cut of her sails, an English
merchantman. She came within about three miles
of them, but Captain Knight neither gave orders to
have the course of the Hazlewood altered, or signals
of distress run up. Every moment Tom expected
to hear such an order, but none passed the captain’s
lips. Presently, he shut the tube of the glass
sharply, and then he spoke.

“She’s too large for us to tackle in our present
condition,” said he.

“Tackle!” burst out Jack. “My G—d! You
didn’t think of fighting that vessel, did you?”

Captain Knight turned sharply upon him, as
though he were about to say something; but he
seemed to think better of it, for he swung on his
heel, as though to enter his cabin again.

Then Jack Baldwin strode directly up to him.
“Captain Knight,” said he, and he did not so much[84]
as touch his hat, “a’n’t you going to signal that
vessel?”

His voice rang like a bell, and every man aboard
of the sinking ship heard it, and listened eagerly for
the captain’s answer. Captain Knight stood where
he was, and looked Jack from top to toe, and back
again.

“No, sir,” said he, coldly, “I am not going to
signal that vessel.”

“Do you mean to say that you’re going to
drown every man aboard this ship, as you might a
cage full of rats, just because you’re too proud to
signal an Englishman.”

Captain Knight made no answer; he only looked
at Jack and smiled, and Tom Granger thought that
it was as wicked a smile as he had ever seen in all
of his life.

“Now, by the eternal,” roared Jack, “I’ll run the
signals up myself!”

“You’ll do nothing of the kind,” said Captain
Knight. He spoke very quietly, but his face was
as white as the other’s was red.

“Won’t I? That you’ll see,” said Jack, passionately,
and he made a movement to turn.

“Wait a moment, sir,” said the captain, in his
quiet voice. But the words were hardly out of his
mouth, when, as quick as a flash, a pistol was
leveled at Jack’s head, with a pair of wicked grey
eyes behind it.

There was a dead pause for about as long as you
could count ten; the captain’s finger lay on the[85]
trigger, and every instant Tom expected to see the
flash that was to come. He held his breath, for
there was death in the captain’s eyes, but he did
not draw the trigger.

It was Tom that broke the silence. “For God’s
sake, don’t shoot, captain,” cried he, from where he
stood. The captain did not seem to hear him.

“You mutinous scoundrel,” said he at last,
“down on your knees and ask pardon!”

Jack did not move.

“You hear me? Down on your knees and ask
pardon, or you’re a dead man!”

He spoke as quietly as ever, but there was a
deadly ring in his voice for all that.

“I’ll give you till I count three,” said he, at last,
and then he began to count, “one,—two—”

Jack looked around, with despair in his eyes.
The captain smiled. “Stand where you are,” said
he, and then his teeth and tongue began to form
the “th—”

Jack Baldwin was no coward; but would you
yourself have stood still and be shot down like a
dog? It would have been a brave man indeed—a
foolishly brave man—that would have done such a
thing. I will not tell the rest. It is enough to say
that Jack did do that which the captain ordered
him, and that before the whole ship’s company.

“You are wise,” said Captain Knight, dryly, and
then he thrust the pistol back again into his belt,
and, turning on his heel, went into his cabin.

Jack got up slowly from his knees. His face[86]
was haggard and drawn. He looked at no one, but
went to the side of the ship and stood gazing into
the water. Tom saw him a half an hour afterward,
standing just in the same way, and in the
same place.

When the captain had gone into his cabin, Tom
turned to the pumps again. “Shake her up!——
your eyes! Shake her up!” roared he.

It was the first time that he ever used an oath to
the men under him, and it is hard to tell why he
used it then, for in his heart he did not believe that
he was long for this life. Then the men fell to
pumping again, but what little life they had left was
all gone out of them now.



[87]




CHAPTER VIII.


THAT evening Tom took a scrambling meal in
the cuddy; it was the last that he had aboard
of the Nancy Hazlewood.

The darkness came on early, and the wind still
held as heavy as ever when night fell. At that
time the ship was very low in the water astern, and
Tom did not expect her to live till morning. Even
to this day it is a mystery to him why she did not
founder long before she did.

It was plain that even the sailors themselves felt
that there was no hope; they were dull, lifeless and
spiritless. Those who were not working at the
pumps, stood around the forecastle, or lay in their
hammocks; all were quiet, excepting where one or
two were talking together in low tones.

Of course, there was no sleep to be had for Tom
that night. He had stood by the pumps since
early in the morning, and was nearly exhausted,
for there were times when he could feel the water
washing around his waist. One after another the
men would drop the brakes, altogether done up,
but there was no chance for him to leave his station
and get a little rest. Jack had done nothing since[88]
his encounter with Captain Knight, the afternoon
before. Captain Knight himself did not come out
of his cabin, so Tom seemed to be the only officer
in charge of the ship.

“Shake her up, lads! Shake her up!” cried he,
whenever there were signs of flagging at the
pumps, and he repeated these words so often that
he began to say them mechanically.

So the weary night dragged slowly along, and at
last the dull light of the morning came, and the
Nancy Hazlewood was still afloat. One by one the
things stood out in the pallid light of the dawning;
first of all the black troubled field of water was
seen, sharply marked against the slowly greying
sky; then came a faint light across the flooded
deck, against which the men stood out as black as
ink, as they worked at the pumps.

About eight o’clock in the morning Captain
Knight came upon deck again. He, Jack Baldwin,
Mr. Wilde (the surgeon), the boatswain and one or
two of the men were standing on the poop together.
No attention was paid to these men standing aft the
quarter deck, and Tom could not see that any
orders were given, for the helm was lashed, keeping
the vessel before the wind.

Tom left the pumps for a minute or two, and
slipped into the cuddy for a dram of rum, which
he very much needed. He found that the cuddy
was awash with several inches of water. He took
the dram of rum, and then looking around his
state room he saw his sea-chest, and opened it and[89]
took out his watch and purse. He slipped the
watch into his pocket, but the ship giving a sudden
lurch at the time, he dropped his purse. He
smiled when he found himself groping in the
swashing water for it, for he could not take it with
him where he expected that he would have to go.

The men had left the pumps when he came upon
deck again. A crowd of them were standing foreward,
some on the top-gallant forecastle. There
was no drunkenness amongst them, and Tom found
later that the spirit-room had been fastened securely,
and in good time, which was about the only timely
thing that was done in the whole business. He
did not order them to work again, for there could
be no use in it. Indeed, there had been but little
use in it for some time past, and the only reason
that he had kept the pumps going was because it
seemed better to be doing something than to stand
still, waiting for death. But Captain Knight gave
no orders to lower the boats, and Jack Baldwin did
not seem to care whether they were lowered or not.

At this time there were only two boats left. The
whale-boat had been stove in the night before, and
all of the cutters were gone but one. A part of
one of them was hanging by the stern falls from the
davits. The mate to it was good, however, and,
with a pinnace, capable of holding maybe thirty
men at a pinch, was all that was left of the six
boats that the Nancy Hazlewood had carried with
her when she first started on her cruise.

Tom saw that there was no prospect of Captain[90]
Knight’s giving the order to have the boats cleared
away, so he went aft to the poop, where the captain
stood, and touched his hat to him very respectfully.

“Captain Knight,” said he, “the ship’s sinking,
and I can’t keep the men at their work any longer.
Shall I get the boats cleared away?”

“They won’t work, you say?”

“No, sir.”

The captain took a pinch of snuff. “Then let
’em drown, and be d—d to ’em—the mutinous
dogs,” said he. And he shut the snuff-box lid with
a snap.

“But, captain—” began Tom.

“Mr. Granger,” said the captain, sternly, “I wish
to hear no more. When I want to have the boats
lowered I’ll give the orders, and not till then. You
hear me?”

Tom turned away, sick at heart. He still hoped
that the captain meant to have the boats cleared
away, but in his heart he felt that he intended
nothing of the kind. The men had gathered aft
when they saw that Tom was talking to the captain.
When they heard what came of it, a deep groan
arose from them.

About half an hour passed, and nothing was
done. At the end of that time a number of men
who had been talking together, went over to the
pinnace and began clearing it away, and Tom saw
that they were about to lower it.

Nothing was said to them at the time, and no
one interfered with them. He went forward to[91]
where they were at work, after a while, for he felt
that he might be of some use to them. The boatswain
was amongst them, and he asked him to join
them, as they needed an officer. But Tom shook
his head, for he could not bring himself to leave the
ship. It was false pride on his part, for he should
have gone and have done what he could. If Jack
Baldwin would only have lent a hand with the
other boat, he would not have hesitated, I think.

Well, it was a misfortunate piece of business,
and there is no use in making more of it than need
be. The boat was lowered safely enough; but, in
spite of all that Tom could do, a number of the
crew, maybe thirty or more, jumped into her from
the ship, and she was swamped almost immediately.
Most of the men came climbing back again; but,
to the best of Tom’s recollection, eight or ten of
them were drowned at this time. No one but he
seemed to care very much for this; no doubt they
felt that it was only a question of a few minutes,
earlier or later.

When Tom went back to the poop, Captain
Knight met him with a sneering smile. “You had
better have let the matter alone, Mr. Granger,”
said he; “their blood be on your head.”

Now, Tom had put all the restraint upon himself
that he could. He had felt all the blunders and
mismanagement that had brought them to this pass
as deeply as ever Jack Baldwin could have done,
and had also felt that most of the fault lay at
Captain Knight’s door, but he had never been anything[92]
but respectful to the captain, nor had he ever
let a questionable word pass his lips. But now,
feeling the loss of the poor devils that had been
drowned in the pinnace resting heavily on his mind,
this speech was too much for his patience. He
walked straight up to Captain Knight and looked
him squarely in the eyes.

The captain looked back at him for a little while,
but presently his eyes wavered, and he turned them
aside. Then it was that a certain vague thought
that had been floating about in Tom’s mind, took
shape and form. At first he rejected the thought,
but the longer he looked upon Captain Knight the
more he felt sure that his surmise was right. At
last he spoke:

“Look here, sir,” said he, sternly, “you’re not fit
to be where you are. You’re not in your right
mind—you’re crazy.”

Captain Knight looked up. His face was white
and his eyes uncertain, and, for the first time, Tom
noticed how bloodshot they were. Tom was standing
within arm’s length of him, and presently he saw
that his fingers were sliding furtively toward the
pistol in his belt. Tom kept his eyes fixed upon him.

“Take care,” said he, as quietly as he could,
“don’t touch that pistol.”

Then Captain Knight drew his fingers away.
“You mutinous scoundrel!” whispered he, in a
trembling voice. But he did not look directly at
Tom when he spoke; neither did he again attempt
to draw a pistol.[93]

Tom stood looking at him without a word for
maybe half a minute. He felt that if he turned his
eyes away for so much as a second, he was a dead
man. So he stood without moving. At last he
spoke again:

“Captain Knight, give me that pistol.”

The captain looked from side to side.

“Captain Knight, give me that pistol,” he repeated,
and very sternly. He held out his left hand
as he spoke. His right was clenched, and if the
captain had made a dangerous movement, he would
have smitten him down where he stood. Captain
Knight looked up for an instant. He must have
seen the resolve in Tom’s face, for he slowly drew
out the pistol and put it into his hand.

“Now give me the other,” said Tom. And once
more the captain did as he was bidden. Tom went
to the side of the ship and threw both pistols overboard.
When he turned around the captain had
gone into his cabin. Tom never saw him again.

It was not till all was over that he felt what he
had passed through. So long as he had faced the
captain his purpose had kept him braced to what
he was doing, but now his hands were cold and
trembling nervously.

All of the ship’s crew had been looking on at
what had passed, so he tried to appear as cool as
though nothing of any account had happened. He
went up to where Jack Baldwin was standing.
“Jack,” said he (but his voice trembled a little in
spite of himself), “you’re the chief officer now.[94]
For the Lord’s sake, give orders to get the cutter
cleared away, for there’s no time to lose.”

“I’ll give orders when I choose,” said Jack,
roughly, and he swung on his heel and strode away.

Tom was struck all aback, for he could not think
at first what he had done to touch Jack’s feelings.
Presently Jack came back to him again. He
stopped close in front of him, and folded his arms.

“Look’ee, Tom Granger,” said he, “I suppose
you think that because you got the better of that
d—d sea dandy, you can get the better of me. You
needn’t think that you’re the cock-of-the-walk because
you took the barkers away from him. I
could have done it easy enough, if he hadn’t taken
me unawares. I’ll not deny that you did get the
better of him, but I want you to understand that
you’re not to lord it over me on that account. I’m
the chief officer here, and I’ll give my orders to you,
and not take them from you. So put that in your
pipe and smoke it.” Then he turned on his heel
again and walked away.

But Tom had caught some insight into Jack’s
mind, and he could not but feel a certain contempt
for him, for this was no time for little jealousies and
heart-burnings. He did not say anything to Jack,
for there could be no use in answering such a
speech, so he walked to the mizzen-mast without a
word, and stood leaning against it, looking ahead.
All of a sudden Jack went stumbling down the
ladder from the poop, and forward amongst the
men. Tom saw him a little while afterward, talking[95]
to the boatswain, and then he knew that he
was thinking of lowering the cutter. He was glad
that Jack had so far swallowed his ugly pride, for
it was a pity that all of the men aboard of the ship
should drown, when some of them might get safely
away.

I say that he was glad, but there was a bitter
feeling, too, when he thought of others being
saved, while he was to be left to drown like a rat in
a box. His pride would not let him run away from
the ship to take his chance in the cutter, but, all
the same, his thoughts were very bitter. About
this time he saw that those of the crew not at work
about the cutter were throwing many loose things
overboard. He saw the side of a hen-coop near to
the ship; “I shall keep close to something of that
kind when she goes down,” said he to himself.
They were a good hundred miles from land, but
the thought did not seem as foolish to him then as
it does now, for a man clings to his life as long as
he is able.

Presently, Jack Baldwin came aft. He went to
the lashings of the wheel and put the helm over, so
as to give the cutter a lee, but he never looked at
Tom for a moment. Just as he was about to leave
the poop, however, he turned suddenly, and came
straight across the deck to him.

“Tom,” said he, gruffly; “will you take a try in
the cutter?”

“Not I,” said Tom.

“Why not?”[96]

“One officer’s enough for the boat; it would be
cowardly for me to go!” He spoke bravely
enough, but I am compelled to own that his
courage was only of words, and not of heart.

“Look’ee, Tom Granger,” said Jack, fiercely;
“do you mean to say that I’m a coward?”

“I mean to say nothing about you,” said Tom,
calmly; “you know your own reasons for leaving
the ship better than any other man. If you’re
going for the sake of the crew, you’re no coward;
if you’re going for the sake of your own skin, you
are.”

Jack looked him very hard in the face for a
moment or two. “See here, Tom,” said he, at
last; “you know the old saying;—‘each man for
himself, and the devil take the hindmost;’ don’t be
a fool; go with us, you’re a better hand at managing
a boat than I am.”

“I don’t care to go.”

“Very well, my hearty; suit yourself,” was all
that Jack said, and he swung on his heel, and left
the poop.

Tom saw him a little later standing beside the
cutter with a heavy iron belaying pin in his hand,
so as to keep the men from crowding into the boat.
The men had a great notion of Jack’s strength, and
maybe it was this that kept them back, for Tom
saw no movement in that direction.

About five or ten minutes before the cutter was
lowered, and about half-past ten or eleven o’clock
in the morning of Thursday, the 26th, the ship was[97]
slowly settling by the stern. Any one could see
that there was a great change in the last half of an
hour, and Tom began to be afraid that she would
founder before they could get the boat away. He
went forward to where Jack and the men were
busy at work.

“If you don’t lower away pretty soon, it’ll be too
late, Jack,” said he.

“Tom,” said Jack, turning to him, suddenly,
“don’t be a bull-headed loon in such a matter as
this. Come, and take your chance like a man;
there’s a place in the cutter yet, for I’ve taken care
to save it for you.”

Poor Tom was only a mortal man, and his life
was very sweet to him at that moment, when there
seemed so great a chance of his losing it. Therefore,
he could not screw the words of refusal from
his lips;—he could only shake his head.

“You won’t come?” said Jack.

“No!” roared Tom; “didn’t you hear me say
no? Are you deaf? No! I tell you; no! no!!”

“Now, by the eternal, you shall go, and that
whether you want to or not!” said Jack, and as he
spoke, he flung his arms around Tom, and undertook
to drag him into the boat. Jack had never
measured his strength with Tom before, and it is
altogether likely that he found him to be stronger
than he had any notion of, for, after struggling
with him for a little while, and not being able to
throw him down upon the deck, he presently began
singing out to the boatswain to come and lend him[98]
a hand, as there was no time to lose. So the
boatswain came, and in a short time they had
lashed Tom’s arms and legs so that he could not
move. As soon as they had done this, they
heaved him heels over head into the cutter, and
then stepped in themselves, and all hands lowered
away immediately.

As soon as the boat was in the water, it began
drawing under the channel of the ship, and was in
great peril of being stove, but the boatswain and
two others got out oars, and shoved her off. But
no sooner had they pushed the cutter away, than
she began drawing in again, for there was a suction
that was bringing her right under the stern, which
would have been sudden death to every man in
her, so they brought the oars to bear once more.
At that time the crew of the cutter seemed more
afraid of being drawn under the stern of the ship
than of too many men jumping into the boat; for
the matter of that, Tom saw only one attempt to
keep any of the crew from boarding, and that was
just after the boat had been lowered into the water.

A poor fellow attempted to slide down the falls
from the davits, but the boatswain pushed them to
one side, so that he would have fallen into the water
if he had tried to jump. It seemed to Tom to be a
horrible thing to cut away the last chance that the
poor man had for saving his life; he begged hard
for him as he hung from the davits, but the boatswain
said that the cutter was already full, and that
even one man might be enough to swamp her. I[99]
suppose that the boatswain must have acted
according to his light, but Jack Baldwin, who sat
looking on without speaking, should have seen
that the man was taken aboard.

The second time that the boat was pushed away,
its head came around, and they were soon pulling
from the port side of the ship.

When those aboard of the Nancy Hazlewood saw
that the cutter was clear, and was likely to get
away, they cheered and waved their hands. I can
hardly bear to write of this, even now;—it made
Tom Granger cry like a child.

The boatswain sat next to him where he lay.
He chewed hard at the quid of tobacco in his
mouth, as, lying on his oars, he looked back at the
sinking ship, and at his messmates standing on her
decks. I think, from what some of the sailors
afterward said, that they would have been willing
to put back to the ship, and have taken off a parcel
more of the crew, but nothing of the kind was
done.

So every one lay on his oars and looked back;
just then the sun shone out, pale and watery. Tom
could see the vessel very easily from where he lay.
The fore-top sail was still standing, and also half of
the main-top sail. The yards on the mizzen were
swinging about with the braces loose, and her
bulwarks were as sound as when she left the docks.
Her stern was low in the water, and her bow was
standing so high that her red copper bottom could
be plainly seen.[100]

Soon they ran down into the trough of a sea,
and the Nancy Hazlewood was hidden from sight;
when they came up again, she had changed her
position. They could not see the after-part of the
vessel, though it might have been hidden by a sea,
and not under water. By the pitch of her masts
the ship seemed to be sitting at an angle of about
forty-five degrees. Just then another sea came,
and again they ran down in the trough of it;—when
they came up the Nancy Hazlewood was
nowhere to be seen.



[101]




CHAPTER IX.


FOR a time no one in the cutter moved or said
a word. I remember that the boatswain
chewed at his quid of tobacco as though he was
starving; but he did not speak a word.

It was Jack Baldwin’s voice that broke the
silence.

“The old ship’s gone, boys,” roared he. “We
can’t do her any good, so drop her, and mind what
you’re about, or you’ll be with her before you know
it.” And he was right, for the cutter was heavily
loaded, there being nineteen aboard of her—the
right number of her crew was twelve.

I am bound to say, that I believe if any one of
the crew of the Nancy Hazlewood had been seen
clinging to the loose gear that was floating about
the place where the ship foundered they would
have been taken into the cutter; but no one was
seen, nor was it likely that a man could keep afloat
for any length of time, for the spray was flying.

Such was the loss of the good ship Nancy Hazlewood,
the story of which I have tried to tell you
just as it happened, adding nothing and keeping
nothing back that might give you a clear idea of[102]
how she foundered on that Thursday, the 26th of
April, 1813.

It was judged that she went down in latitude
27° North, by longitude 77° West, and about one
hundred or one hundred and ten miles north of the
Little Bahama Banks.

The cutter was a fine, light boat, about twenty-five
feet in length, by six feet in breadth at the
widest part—a small craft to carry nineteen souls
one hundred miles through a stormy sea.

Ten minutes after the Nancy Hazlewood foundered
the crew of the cutter were pulling away to
the southward. After a little while Tom looked
up and saw that Jack Baldwin was gazing very
earnestly at him.

“Tom,” said he, suddenly, “if I loose the lashings
on your arms and legs, will you promise to be
quiet, and do your fair share of work?”

Tom’s cheeks were still wet, and he was shaken
every now and then by a sob. I hope that you
who read this will not think him overly womanish,
but will give a thought as to how broken he was
with fatigue, and with the hardships through which
he had passed. I can say that none of the crew of
the cutter seemed to think lightly of him on account
of it, and even Jack Baldwin’s voice was kind
as he spoke.

I have always found that when men are strongly
moved they are apt to be very unreasonable. So it
was with Tom, for he felt very bitterly toward Jack
at that moment, as though Jack were to blame for[103]
the trouble that had fallen upon them. However,
nothing could be gained by staying tied as he was,
so he presently said:

“You may untie me, if you like. The Lord
knows that I don’t care much for my life just now,
but there’s no use letting all these poor fellows
drown like the rest.”

“Is that all the thanks I get for saving your
life?” said Jack Baldwin. “Never mind; you’ll
give me more thanks when your feet are safe on
dry land. Untie him, bo’sen, for he’ll have to take
his hand at the oars, along with the rest.”

The first thing that was done was to divide the
boat’s crew into parties, each of which were to row
by spells. Two of the men not rowing were to
keep a lookout ahead, in case any vessel might
heave in sight. The rest were to bail out the boat,
for it was needful to keep bailing nearly all the
time. In most cases it might have been safer to
have tried to ride out the storm, and to have run
the chance of being picked up by some passing
vessel; but there were certain things to be considered
in the case of those in the cutter. Their
provisions and water were none too plenty, and
there was little chance of being picked up, as so
few vessels were sailing in those waters, excepting
in fleets and under convoy.

A landsman would have been puzzled to know
how a boat as small as the cutter could ever hope
to live in a sea such as that was. It was, indeed,
no small matter to run her safely, and Jack, who[104]
was at the tiller, had to keep his weather eye lifting,
I can tell you.

One of the crew kept a constant lookout over
the stern, to see when a wave with a crest was
coming, and to warn the man at the tiller of it, for
these were the seas that brought danger with them.
At one time all hands would back water, so as to
let such a one break in front of them. At another
time they would pull all, so as to get out of the
way until the force of the broken sea was spent.
Sometimes one of these following seas would fling
the cutter high aloft on its crest, carrying it along
like an eggshell for a little distance, and giving
them a dash as it went by that would set them all
bailing for dear life.

Of course, it was needful to let each sea meet
them fairly astern, for if the boat should broach too,
she would be swamped or capsized as quick as
a wink. As soon as one sea would pass them
another would come. Perhaps it would be a cross
sea, which, of course, was the kind that they
dreaded the most of all. Sometimes the helm of
the cutter could not bring her around quickly
enough, or, maybe, just then her rudder would be
clear of the water. Then Jack Baldwin would sing
out in his mighty voice:

“Give way starboard! Back port!” or “Give
way port! back starboard!”

The next moment, perhaps, another green sea
would be seen rushing at them, and Jack would
shout:[105]

“Give way together!”

Then there would be a thunder and a roar
behind them, and the seething of white foam would
hiss alongside of the gunwale, and as it rolled past
Jack’s voice would ring out:

“Back, back all!”

There were times when all four of these orders
would be given inside the space of a minute.
This is what they went through for nearly two
days, so it may perhaps give you a notion of what
they had to do to keep the boat alive for that time,
and what a sea it was to keep her alive in.

They had in the way of provisions about seventy-five
pounds of hard-tack and two small breakers of
water. They presently found that the water in one
of the breakers was mixed with salt, so they heaved
it overboard at once to make more room, as they
were very much crowded.

So the afternoon wore along, and at last evening
began to settle down over them.

Any one but a seaman might have wondered
how the boat was to be kept afloat at night, when
it was only by such unending care that she was
kept alive in the daytime. But as darkness settled
the crest of each wave glimmered with a pale phosphorescence
that not only showed its position, but
the course in which it was traveling. Nevertheless,
it was an awful night, one of the most awful that
Tom Granger has ever passed through. Above the
ceaseless din and thunder of the roaring water Jack
Baldwin’s voice could be heard singing out his[106]
orders to the oarsmen, and now and then to the
others:

“Bail her out smartly, lads! Keep her dry!
Who’s bailing there? Lively now!”

Tom had turned to, and was bailing a great part
of the time. He had been pulling an oar in the
afternoon, for every one had to take his turn; and
so, what with weariness and cold and want of
sleep, he was nearly done up. He managed to joke
and laugh with the men, as though all that they
were passing through was nothing to speak of; but
for all that he would find himself half asleep at
times, though he was still dipping out the water.
When in this state he always had one thing before
his eyeballs; it was a ship, her stern under water
and her bows standing so high that she showed
her copper bottom. Her maintop-gallant-mast was
gone, and her fore-sail was shaking in the wind—it
was the Nancy Hazlewood as he had last seen
her.

It was the same all that night; whenever he
would shut his eyes, even if it were only for a
moment, he would see that sinking ship and the
troubled waters around her.

About four o’clock in the morning Jack gave up
the tiller to Tom Granger. Tom felt very sorry for
him, for he seemed harassed and worn. He himself
was pretty well tired out, as I have said, for he
had only had about two hours sleep for over three
days. Nevertheless, he took the tiller, for Jack
seemed more done up than he. Tom held the[107]
tiller for the rest of that day, and for most of the
next night.

Early in the day it was found that the water had
given out, so they heaved that breaker overboard
also. There was a great mistake somewhere in the
matter of this water. Either the allowance for
each man was wrong, or there was not as much in
the breaker as had been supposed. They had
counted on its lasting eighteen hours longer than it
did, and the lack of it proved to be one of the
greatest causes of their suffering.

The next morning the sun shone out, though
the weather was squally, and the sea as heavy as
ever. By that time they were suffering more from
thirst than from anything else. Tom pitied the
poor men from the bottom of his heart. The
boatswain, who sat nearest him, kept clearing his
throat, as though he could get rid of the dryness
and the pain in that way.

As the sharpness of their thirst increased, the
men showed that there was not the friendly feeling
between them that there had been at first. They
were surly, would speak sharply to one another,
and were sullen when spoken to by Jack or Tom.
About nine o’clock one of the men on the lookout
sang out all of a sudden:

“Land over the port bow!”

Jack had the tiller again at this time, and it was
all that Tom could do to keep the men from standing
up in the boat. If they had done so, they
would have capsized her, in all likelihood. About[108]
a quarter of an hour afterward they were near
enough to hear the surf thundering on the beach.
Some of the men were for landing off-hand, and
both Jack and Tom found it hard work to keep
these fellows in order.

Tom thought that the land in front of them was
most likely one of the smaller islands at the northern
part of the Bahama group. A line of white
sand-hills, topped by a growth of coarse grass and
low scrub bushes, could be seen a little distance
inland. The shore stretched northerly and southerly,
and looking from the seaward, they could see
no break in it.

Jack put the boat’s head to the southward, so as
to keep the seas pretty well to the stern, his idea
being to run along the coast line until he could
either turn the end of the island, or find some creek
or inlet where there would be a fit place to beach
the cutter.

There was a current setting up the beach, and it
was very laborious work pulling against it, so, as
time went on, the men grumbled louder and louder,
saying that they might just as well land where they
were, and that there was no use breaking their
hearts with rowing, while they might beach the
boat, with only a ducking at the worst.

Tom was more sorry for the men, than angry at
them, for any one could see how parched they were
with thirst, and how nearly worn out.

At last a sailor named Hitch flung down his oar,
and swore that he would row no more, without it[109]
was to row to the shore. An approving growl
went up amongst the men, and things began to
take a very ugly look. Jack was in a towering
rage; he swore at the men, as only he could swear;
but every moment showed that they could not be
kept at their oars a great while longer.

Meantime the man Hitch sat sullenly, answering
Jack’s words with others not a bit better.

“Tom,” roared Jack, all of a sudden; “Tom,
come here and take this tiller, while I settle that
mutinous son of a sea cook.”

He made a step forward as he spoke, but in a
moment the man’s fingers were around the boat’s
plug.

“You’ll settle me, will you?” cried he. “— —
your eyes! Come a step furder, and I’ll out with
this plug, and send us all to the bottom, with the
boat under us!”

Jack stopped where he was, for he saw that the
fellow would do as he said; had he done so, the
boat would have filled and gone down in a minute.

When Jack stopped, a laugh went up from all
around, for it was plain to see that the men were in
sympathy with Hitch. This made the fellow feel
inclined to go a step further, for he felt bold when
he saw Jack pause.

“If you don’t put the boat’s head to the shore,”
said he, “I’ll pull out the plug, anyhow!”

“Tom,” cried Jack, passionately, “give me the
tiller; if they will drown for a pack of lubberly
fools, let them drown and be ——d!”[110]

“For heaven’s sake, Jack!” cried Tom; “think
what you’re about. You’ll drown us all. Let me
hold the tiller!”

But Jack was blind and deaf with his passion,
and would listen to nothing. Tom struggled with
him as long as he was able; holding on to the
tiller with might and main, fighting him off, and
pleading with him all the while.

I suppose that they must have fought for two or
three minutes, and the boat was nearly swamped
more than once with their struggles. At last Jack
wrenched Tom’s hands away and seized hold of the
tiller, for a great part of Tom’s strength had gone
from him, because of long and hard exposure,
which seemed to have told more upon him than on
Jack.

The men appeared to be pretty well frightened
by this time, and Hitch had taken his oar again.
In a moment Jack had put the boat’s head toward
the shore.

“Pull lively now, my hearties,” said he, grimly,
“for you’ll have a tough pull of it before you get
to that beach over yonder.”

Just before they came to the outer line of
breakers, Jack put the cutter’s head about so as to
let her beach stern foremost.

Tom knew that the cutter would never get through
the breakers. There was not the tenth part of the
tenth part of a chance of it; therefore he flung off
his coat and kicked off his shoes, so as to be in
readiness when the time should come. There was[111]
not much of the raging and the lashing of the surf
to be seen from the sea. Now and then a spit of
foamy water would shoot high up into the air from
the recoil of the waters on the hard sand, but they
could not tell what the full wrath and roaring of
the great breakers were until they had gotten fairly
in amongst them.

Jack did all that a man could do to get that boat
to the beach. He tried rather to keep it off than to
urge it too rapidly toward the shore. He did his
work well, for he had brought the cutter through
the first line of breakers, and into the second—but
he got her no further.

A monstrous wave, fully twelve feet high, a solid
mountain of green water, came rushing toward
them, its crest growing sharper and sharper, and
seeming to mount higher and higher as it swept
toward the shore.

“Pull for your lives!” roared Jack, in a voice of
thunder. But it was no use, for the next instant
the breaker was on them. For a moment Tom
had a feeling of spinning toward the shore, with
the green water towering ten feet above him; then it
arched slowly over, there was a crash and a roar, and
he was struggling in a whirling, watery blindness.

Over and over he rolled, grasping at the sand
every now and then, but all the time feeling himself
as helpless as a rat in the tumultuous swirling of
the water. Presently he felt himself being sucked
out again. Faster and faster he went, as the undertow
gathered force in its rush. For a moment he[112]
gained his feet, and bore with all his strength
against the outgoing water. The sand slid from
beneath his heels, till he must have sunk three
inches into it. For an instant he had a half-blinded
vision of Jack Baldwin, fifteen or twenty feet nearer
to the shore than himself. Then came another
crashing roar, and he was whirled over and over
and round and round, like a feather in the water.
A great feeling of utter helplessness came over
him; for a moment his lips came to the surface
and he gave a gurgling cry.

Out went the undertow again, and out went Tom
with it, only to meet another breaker and to be
again whirled by it toward the beach. By this
time he had given up struggling, and everything
was sliding away from him.

All of a sudden he felt himself clutched by the
shirt. Once more came the horrible dragging of
the undertow, but this time some one was holding
him against it. Everything was glimmering to his
sight, but he felt that he was being dragged up on
the beach, and at last that he was lying on the dry
sand, face up, and Jack Baldwin panting alongside
of him.



[113]





[114][115]
PART II




CHAPTER X.


IN this story of Tom Granger I have undertaken
to divide that which I am writing into chapters
and parts, in the same manner that novel writers
sometimes divide their novels and tales. I find
that it keeps me more steadily to my course, so
that, though I wander now and then from the
matter in hand, I always get safely back to my
bearings again. If you will go with me to the end,
you will find that I have spun my yarn to the last
word, though it may be in my own fashion.

Every one has read tales of shipwreck and of
lonely islands, and there is generally something
romantic and even pleasant in them; but in real
shipwreck there is nothing either romantic or
pleasant; neither is a desert island a cheerful place
to dwell upon. I say this because I wish you to
understand why it is that I do not intend to give
you a long account of the life that they led at this
place.

Nevertheless, I would not have you think from
that which I have just written that Tom and Jack
were altogether miserable during the year and a half
that they lived there. Many times they were sick[116]
at heart looking for the aid that was so long in
coming; but there were other times when they
were full of hopes, and times when they were even
happy. Neither was the place a barren, desolate,
dreary sand waste, such as are many of the Bahama
Islands. They saw many curious and beautiful
things during the time of their living there. As
an instance I may say that when Tom came away
he brought with him a parcel of as handsome shells
as ever I saw in all my life. They are now piled
upon the mantle-shelf in my parlor. I have them
before my eyes as I write these words. There is
a large one upon the centre-table that has a full-rigged
ship wrought upon it. It was carved with a
jack-knife, and it shows the work of many idle
moments, when Tom sat beside the fire in front of
their hut at night, with Jack Baldwin for company.

Oftentimes a great longing has come upon Tom
to visit the old place once more, and to see those
things again which he learned to know so well. As
I sit here now, and close my eyes, I can see many
of them with my inward sight. I can even see them
more clearly than when the memory of them was
fresh and green, for, as the eyes of one’s body
become dim and blurred, the eyes of memory
become ever sharper and keener, so that not even
the smallest thing escapes their sight. So now I
can see the place that was Tom’s home for sixteen
months so long ago, as plainly as though I had left
it only yesterday. I can see the cave in the side of
the sand-hill, the cutter turned bottom up for the[117]
roof, and the screen of woven grass that hung in
front to keep the rain from beating in. I can even
see the tame sea-gull sitting on the keel of the
upturned boat.

Oftentimes, as I sit smoking my pipe after my
dinner, I slide off into a doze, and sometimes I
dream of all these places—of the sand-spit where
they found the half-buried wreck that brought them
so strange a fortune; of the long, narrow tongue of
sand beyond, where, at low tide, the flamingoes
always stood in a line, like so many red-coated
British soldiers; of the coral reef where they
fished; of the beach where the turtles came to drop
their eggs, and of other things, all of them seeming
pleasant as I look at them down through the
distance of the past. So I should like to see the
old place once more with my mortal eyes, though I
may never hope to do so now, for my sands are
nearly run.

But, though the place may seem pleasant to me
after all these years, it was not an island such as
one reads of in novels and stories; it was not a
place upon which one would choose to live all
one’s years, and Tom Granger was tired enough of
it before he got through with it, I can tell you.

My neighbors profess to be very fond of listening
to me when I get started in upon spinning yarns
about Tom Granger’s life on the island, and I think
that not only do they profess to be fond of it, but
that they really are so.

My dear old friend, the late Doctor White, used[118]
to come regularly every Saturday night, winter or
summer, clear or foul, and the first thing that he
would say was:

“Come, Tom, spin us a yarn;” or, “Let us hear
one of your traveler’s lies, Tom.” (This, you
understand, was merely a piece of pleasantry upon
his part.) Then straightway I would begin upon
some yarn, while he would sit opposite to me
across the fire, listening to me and smoking his
pipe the while. I must say, though, that he had a
nasty habit of interrupting me with experiences of
his own, for he had been assistant surgeon aboard
the Pimlico, in the South Atlantic, from 1836 to
1838, and he had seen a few little trivial things
which he would tell me, though I had heard them
a score of times before, and though they were not
nearly as interesting as those things which I would
be telling him.

However, that is neither here nor there, and I
find that I am again wandering from the point in
hand. What I began to say was, that, though my
neighbors are always glad to listen to my yarns,
and though they tell me that they are both interesting
and instructive, I will not give a long and
full account of Tom’s and Jack’s daily life upon the
island on which they were cast, for this narrative
concerns other matters of more import, and I thank
my stars that I am able to bridle my tongue, being,
as I said before, no great talker.

Tom and Jack were the only ones of all the
crew of the cutter that were cast alive on the island.[119]
The first day or two of their life thereon was as
bitter and miserable as could be. All this would
be both painful and unpleasant to tell, as well as
needless, and, therefore, I will pass it by. By the
time that a month had gone, they were settled as
comfortably as could be, considering what they had
at hand to make themselves comfortable.

The body of the island was about five miles in
length, and about two miles or two miles and a half
in breadth at the widest part. From the lower and
easterly end a long, sandy hook ran out into the
ocean. It was the continuation of the eastern
beach, and, with the south shore of the island, it
enclosed a smooth, deep bay or harbor, in which
even the largest ships could have ridden at anchor
easily and comfortably.

On the Atlantic side of this sand-spit, and close
to where it joined the body of the island, was the
sunken wreck that afterward had so much to do
with Tom’s fortunes, and of which I shall soon
have more to tell you. The eastern side of this
hook or beach was of sloping sand, washed up by
the continual beating of the surf. The western, or
bay side, was an abrupt coral reef. This coral reef
was covered with barnacles, so that there were
always plenty of fish to be caught along that shore
during the slack water or the young flood.

Up and down the length of the eastern shore,
and following in a line with the beach, was a ridge
of white sand hills. A number of scrub trees grew
along the crest of this ridge, and it was these trees[120]
or bushes that the lookout in the cutter had first
sighted. In the south-western end of these sand
hills Jack and Tom built their hut.

The lower end of the chain of white hills made a
sudden turn to the westward, and not far from
where they fell away to the level of the beach was
a thicket of underbrush, with half a dozen palmetto
trees growing in the midst of it. Near to the edge
of this thicket a spring of clear, cool water bubbled
up out of the white sand, and slid away through
thick grasses and sedge until it found its way
through a marshy little flat into the bay.

It was close to this spot that they chose to live,
and thither they dragged the cutter from the place
where she had been flung on the sand, two or three
miles further up the beach. The boat had been
stove in beyond all hopes of repairing, especially as
they had no tools to mend it with, excepting their
jack-knives and two rude chisels that Tom afterward
made from rusty bolts which they picked out
of the ribs of the wreck on the sand-spit. But, even
if they had had a whole boat-builder’s outfit, and
planks to spare, I doubt if the cutter could have been
mended, for not only had the bottom been stove
in, but the bow had been smashed into splinters.

The loss of the cutter was one of their bitterest
sources of regret during their life on this place,
for now and then they could see the looming of
land not more than twenty miles away toward the
southward. They could easily have reached it
in a day’s time, if the boat had been sound and[121]
whole. As it was, she would never float again,
so they dragged her down the beach and patched
her with grass and mud, and used her for a roof to
cover them at night, for they found that the dews
were heavy at some seasons of the year. It took
them over a fortnight to move the boat from where
she had been thrown to the place where they built
their home, three miles away. It was heavy work
hauling it across the sand, but, as I said, by the
time that a month had gone, they were pretty
comfortably settled, and were feeling quite at home
in their quarters.

In front of them was the long, narrow hook of
white sand, over which the air danced and quivered
when the hot sun beat down upon it. It curved
out into the dark water for a mile, like a long,
slender hook, cutting off the bay from the open
water beyond. To the right of them was the bay
shore of the island, the silvery sand strewn thickly
with many-colored shells as far as the eye could
reach. About three hundred yards away was the
buried wreck. At that time nothing was to be
seen of it but the ribs, that just showed above the
sand like a row of dead, blackened stumps. From
this wreck they obtained iron spikes, which Tom
fashioned into rude tools and ruder fish-hooks.

Such was the scene that they had before their
eyes for all those sixteen months, unchanged, excepting
as storm or calm would change the face of
things; and the same monotonous sound was always
in their ears—the eternal “swash! swash!” of the[122]
ground swell on the shell-strewn beach below the
hut, sounding unceasingly through the deep, heavy
thundering of the Atlantic breakers to the eastward.

Day followed day in an unchanging round—now
fishing and now hunting gull’s eggs. The fishing
was done in the morning, when the tide was good.
During the hot afternoons they would lie on the
sand, in the shade of the cutter, looking out to sea,
talking lazily, and now and then dozing. It was a
helpless, listless life, and as time wore along, I
doubt if they would have known what day or
month or even what year it was, if Tom had not
kept a score of the days as they passed, by marking
them on the side of the cutter with his jack-knife—a
short mark for week days and a long mark with a
cross for Sundays. By this means they contrived
to know how time was going with them.

This enforced inaction was one of the bitterest
trials to them. I have known times when, while
they were sitting still, Jack would burst out into a
sudden volley of imprecations. Tom would never
give way in this manner;—perhaps it would have
been a relief to him if he had. When the darkness
of despair would settle over him, he would leave
Jack, and walk up and down the beach by himself;
perhaps for hours at a time. During all the time
that the Nancy Hazlewood was sinking under him,
Tom had thought little of Patty, and had wondered
at himself in a dull sort of a way; perhaps it was
the press of work that was then upon him, that
drove her out of his mind, or rather blunted the[123]
keenness of the thought of her. But now, in the
listless idleness of his life, he thought of her, and
thought of her continually. Her presence was
always with him, and at times his longing for her
was so deep and keen, that his heart ached with it.
Often in the night time he would lie on the dark,
lonely sand, looking up at the stars, saying nothing,
but thinking of Patty and of his home, with a longing
so strong, that sometimes he was nearly crazy with
the yearning of his home-sickness. At other times
the gloominess of a deep despair would settle over
him in a dark cloud; then, perhaps, he would say
to himself, “Supposing that I do get back to my
home again, what good will it do me? I have
been given a year in which to earn seven hundred
and fifty dollars; it may be two years before I am
taken off of this sand spit,—what chance is there of
my earning that much here?” Then, maybe he
would get up and walk away, pacing up and down
the beach by himself, cursing the fortune that had
thrown him on this land, and sometimes even
selfishly wishing that he could die, and be rid of all
the troubles that beset him. During such moods
Jack would leave him alone, for he saw that Tom
was thinking of things, and was not to be talked to
or interfered with;—he had grown to have a
strangely high regard and respect for him; very
different from the way in which he used to look
upon him. He seemed to have a dim idea that
Tom’s troubles were deeper than his own, but why
they were greater, he did not know, for Tom never[124]
talked of Patty to him. So Jack always let him
alone, and, though he would follow him with his
eyes, he never ventured a word at such times.

I would not have you think that Tom was
twiddling his thumbs all this time, and idly wishing
that he could get away without doing anything
further than to wish.

During the fall they built a raft; it took them
nearly a month and a half to make it, for they had
no tools to work with, but two rude chisels and two
jack-knives, one of which (Jack’s) had the point
broken off of it. But after they had spent all the
time in the making of the raft, it turned out to be
of no use, excepting to fish off of in the bay during
fair weather, so all their labor was for nothing.

They had great ideas of it at first, and one day
when the wind was fair, and the day clear and
bright, they undertook to sail away upon it to the
island to the southward. Tom had fashioned a
pair of oars out of a palmetto tree, and he and
Jack had made a sail out of the coarse sea-grass
that covered the island; these had cost them vast
labor, but they found that with oars and sail
together, they did not get their clumsy craft along
at the rate of a mile an hour. I doubt if they ever
could have reached the island under the best of
circumstances; as it was, they met a current a
couple of miles to the southward, that swept them
out to sea. They were fully six hours in getting
back to land; even then it was a chance that they got
back at all, nor would they have done so if a wind[125]
had not luckily sprung up from the south. After
that they were content to remain where they were.

They also set up a signal: it was a palmetto tree
with a bush lashed to the top of it; beside this they
built a pile of brush to fire at night, in case any
vessel should appear in the offing at evening time.
They added to this brush heap, from day to day,
until it was as high as a hay stack.

Once, during the latter part of that autumn, a dead
porpoise was washed up on the beach toward the
lower part of the sandy hook. This was a Godsend
to them as a means to let their condition be
known to the outside world, for of the skin of this
porpoise they made a number of bags or bladders,
which they set adrift at different times, when the
wind was fair for carrying them away. In these
air bladders Tom put a map of the island, its
bearings (as nearly as he could judge), and word of
their condition. All this was drawn and written
on two strips of bark, and was done with the point
of a red hot piece of iron. This was the wording
of the written part:


The ship Nancy Hazlewood
of Philadelphia was lost
at sea on the 26 of Apl.
1813. The 1st &amp; 2d mates
by name John Kent Baldwin
and Thomas Granger were
wrecked on ths. Islnd. If
you are a Christn. come to
thr. aid.



[126]

This I have copied from a slip of bark that
Captain Williamson afterward gave me.

Thus they settled and lived on the island with
little of interest happening in their lives, until the
great hurricane of 1814 came upon them. This
was great in itself, but it brought that with it which
let them have no more idle days for a long time to
come.



[127]




CHAPTER XI.


I &nbsp; SUPPOSE that there are very few people who
read this story that have not heard of the great
hurricane of 1814, for I take it that very few will
read what I have written who are not in some way
related or connected with Tom Granger, and all
such have heard him tell of it again and again.
Nevertheless, as I have ink and paper before me,
and as the itch of writing is upon me, I will tell it
once more for the benefit of those who come hereafter,
and who have not heard of it from Tom’s
own mouth.

This hurricane reached over a zone stretching in
breadth from Florida to the Greater Antilles. It
was felt more heavily in the northern part than
anywhere else; so that Tom and Jack passed
through the worst of it. One hundred and eight
vessels were wrecked in the harbors and on the
coast of this region during the progress of the
hurricane, and the death-list was known to reach as
high as one hundred and six. The crops suffered
severely, and over seven hundred houses were
destroyed.

A few years ago, while I was spending a couple[128]
of weeks at Atlantic City with my wife and two of
my grandchildren, I met a Mr. Fitzgerald. He was
a lad living at Nassau at the time of this hurricane,
and he not only remembered it well, but his father,
who was a gentleman much interested in scientific
matters, had kept careful data and memoranda
relating to it.

Mr. Fitzgerald was a very bright and intelligent
old gentleman at the time that I met him, and I
was much interested in talking the matter over
with him, and comparing notes regarding it. The
storm was severe enough with Tom and Jack, but
it must have been terrible indeed in a place where
there were so many lives to be lost and so much
property to be destroyed as in Nassau. He told
me that the storm began with them about ten
o’clock in the night of the fourth of March, and
blew with great violence until half-past ten o’clock
in the morning of the fifth. The barometer at that
time stood at 27.06 inches, which was the lowest
that his father had ever seen it. From that time
the storm subsided, and the torrents of rain began
to cease, though the wind continued to blow with
violence until four o’clock in the afternoon. But
all the great loss of life and property happened in
the space of twelve hours, and while the hurricane
was at its height.

The storm began at an earlier hour with Jack
and Tom than it did at Nassau, according to Mr.
Fitzgerald’s account of it. I know, however, that
it came on the fourth of March, because that is the[129]
day before Tom’s birthday, which comes on the
fifth; therefore I am accurate in regard to my
dates, even if Mr. Fitzgerald had not corroborated
the account that I have always given of it.

It was a peculiarly sultry day, especially for that
time of the year. Tom and Jack were fishing in
the morning, and, though they were sitting still,
the sweat kept running from Tom’s face in streams,
as though he was engaged in doing a hard piece
of work. All morning there was a dead stillness
and a leaden heaviness in the air, and it seemed
as though it was a labor even to breathe. The
sea gulls kept flying around the reef in a troubled
way, clamoring as they flew, and seeming to be
restless and uneasy at the oppressive stillness.
The sky in the morning was of a dull copperish
color, though not a cloud was to be seen, but, as
the day wore along, a misty haze spread above
them, through which the sun shone red and dull,
as it does in the morning and evening, when it is
near to the horizon. Once Jack said:

“Tom, there’s something going to happen. I
never felt anything like this in all my life before;
and did you ever see the sea gulls behaving as
they are doing now? Mark my words, Tom,
there’s something going to come of all this before
the day’s over.”

Tom agreed with him in his forebodings, for the
oppression that he was laboring under made him
feel singularly apprehensive and uneasy in his
mind. In the afternoon they left their fishing and[130]
went back to their hut, where they stretched themselves
out in the shade, panting for breath, for it
seemed as though a hot blanket had been spread
above them. The tame sea gull sat under the lee
of the boat, all hunched up together. Every now
and then it would look restlessly about, uttering a
low, whimpering note as it did so.

About four o’clock in the afternoon, as near as
Tom could judge, a strong puff of wind blew
suddenly from the south. It ceased as suddenly as
it began, but, in a few minutes a gust as sudden and
as short-lived blew from the west. Then it blew
again, but from the eastward. This time it was
more steady, and in a quarter of an hour it had
increased to a smart gale. It seemed to bring
some coolness with it, and lifted the oppressed
feeling that had rested upon Tom and Jack during
the morning. Within an hour or so of sundown
this wind died away completely, and then it was as
heavy, and as still, and as sultry as ever. Then half
an hour passed before anything farther happened.

Jack and Tom were busy scaling and cleaning
their fish when, all of a sudden, a shadow fell as
though a hand had been stretched out across the
sky. Jack ran out of the hut with his knife in his
hand, and the next moment Tom heard him calling
to him in a loud voice, bidding him to hurry out
and look at what was coming. Then Tom dropped
everything and ran.

As I said before, there was not a breath of air
stirring, and yet a black ragged wrack of clouds[131]
was flying wildly above their heads. This bellying
sheet of clouds hung very low in the air; above
them it was of a dull leaden color, rimmed with a
strange reddish light, but toward the west it was as
black as ink. Although there was no wind going,
a cold air seemed to breathe out of the black
emptiness of the west, just such as you may feel
when you open the door of a cool room in the
summer time. The ocean near to them was grey,
with the light from the east, and every now and
then a white-cap would gleam, with a pallid light
against the darkness behind; but in the distance it
grew darker and darker, until the rim of the
horizon was lost in the inky pall beyond. Every
moment the gloom fell about them, until it seemed
as though night had set in, though it was a
good hour till sundown. A dull, whispering
moaning sound came from out the hollow of the
west, and Tom could hear it through all the beating
and thundering of the surf behind him. There
was something awful in that moaning that seemed
to fill the air above and around them; both men
stood looking out toward the west, and neither of
them said a word. Tom noticed how the sea gulls
were running restlessly up and down the beach,
uttering shrill wild cries every now and then, but
not taking to wing.

And every moment the deep moaning grew
louder and louder.

Suddenly a faint breath of air came, and instantly
the sound of the surf to the east was dulled as[132]
though a blanket had been spread over it. Then
there was a pause,—then there was a wild sweep of
the wind,—then, in an instant, the hollow roar was
upon them and around them.

Out from the blackness of the west came rushing
an awful grey cloud of mist and rain and salt spray,
and before I can write these words, it struck the
island with a tremendous and thunderous uproar.
Tom and Jack were flung backward and down to
the ground as though a wall had fallen upon them,
and all around them was a blinding gloom of sand
and rain and spray. Through this whirling darkness
Tom saw the cutter lifted up and tossed over
and over like a dead leaf. Even through all the
uproar he could distinctly hear the noise of snapping
and rending and tearing, as the trees and
bushes of the thicket near to them were being torn
up by the roots. Then he had a vision of one of
the palmetto trees being whirled through the air as
though it were a straw.

For a while he lay clinging flat to the ground,
digging his fingers into the sand; but after a while
he saw that Jack was crawling on his hands and
knees toward the lee of the sand hills, not far away
from where they lay; then he followed him in like
manner.

It was a great while before they got safely to the
shelter of the duns; I suppose that it could not
have taken them less than half an hour to cross the
two hundred yards of sand that lay between them
and the lee of the sand hills. Every now and then[133]
a heavier gust than usual would come, and then
they would lay flat upon the sand again, holding
on to the shifting surface, as though they feared
being blown bodily away. But between the gusts
they would contrive to crawl a few feet farther.

At last they reached the lee of the hills, and so
were sheltered from the full force of the wind,
though the hurricane bellowed and roared above
and around them with a noise such as Tom never
heard before or since.

The rain increased till it fell in torrents; it did
not beat down the wind, for the tempest blew more
and more heavily until just before morning, when
it was something frightful.

All that night the rain poured down upon them
in a deluge, but I do not think that either of them
noticed it, their minds being taken up with quite
different matters. The darkness around them was
utter and blank beyond what I can tell you. You
could not have seen your hand within six inches of
your face. It seemed as though the end of all
things had come.

Tom and Jack sat hand in hand;—when one of
them said anything to the other, he had to put his
lips to within an inch of his companion’s ear, to
make him understand a single word. But very
little was said between them, and most of the time
they sat holding one another’s hand in silence.
Now and then the ground would actually tremble
beneath them, and at times a dim fear passed
through Tom’s mind that the very sand hill above[134]
them would be carried bodily away with the force
of that tremendous blast. About day-break, or
what would have been day-break at an ordinary
time, the rain ceased to fall, though the hurricane
still raged with nearly as much fury as ever.

At last the faint grey daylight came, and after a
while they were able to see the things around them
pretty clearly. The first thing that Tom saw was a
white sea gull crouched on the ground close to
him. He could have reached out his hand and
have touched it, but it did not seem to be in the
least afraid at his presence. There were hundreds
of them around, but they all seemed to be dulled
with terror, and made no effort to move out of the
way, or to take to flight.

At length, in the dim morning light, the ocean
came out before them; it was a strange sight, for
the surf was beaten down by the wind, until the
sand beach reached out half as far again as it did
on ordinary occasions.

At first they could see nothing of the sandy hook
to the southward, for, though no sea was running,
and though the ocean was leveled to a seething
sheet of whiteness, the water was banked up in the
bay, and covered the sand spit completely. The
first thought that occurred to Tom was that the
whole bar had been swallowed up, and that there
had been an earthquake, though they had not
noticed it in all the bewilderment of the tempest.
But, as the light grew stronger and stronger, they
could see the gleam of wet sand here and there,[135]
and then could see the water running over it from
the bay to the ocean.

By this time the storm was beginning to fall,
though they did not dare to leave their shelter for
an hour or so later, and though the wind was still
heavy until the middle of the afternoon.

When they did leave the lee of the hill, the sight
was strange enough; the palmetto trees were all
gone but one, and it was more than half stripped of
leaves.

One of them had been carried more than a
quarter of a mile, and was now lying half buried in
the sand at the base of the dun, beneath which they
had taken shelter.

There was not a sign of their home in the sand
hill, for not only was the place levelled over as
completely as though it had never been, but the
very shape of the hills themselves had been changed
by the sand that had blown against them here, or
had been carried away from them there.

The cutter had been swept away to a distance of
two or three hundred yards. It had lodged in a
hollow between two of the duns. It was lying keel
up, and the sand was banked around the weather
side of it like a snowdrift. Strange enough, it was
not much more broken than it had been before, so
they got it back again in a day or two, and it was
still sound enough to serve for their roof for the
balance of the time that they stayed on the island.

The great stack of brushwood that they had
heaped on the highest sand-dun had all been[136]
carried away, as had also their signal tree with the
bush lashed to it. Everything was salt with the
spray that had been carried inland, and the island
flats were dotted all over with pools of salt water,
that had been blown or swept over the land.
Wherever this salt water lay the grass was killed
or blackened, so that the following summer the
island looked as though fire had passed over it.

Such was the great hurricane of 1814 as Tom
Granger and Jack Baldwin felt it; and I think
that they both felt it in its full force, though
they escaped from it with no more harm than a
thorough wetting and a great fright. It took them
several weeks to do what they could at making
good the damage done, and then it was not fully
repaired, for all the provisions that they had stored
up had been carried away or had been covered up
by the sand that had been blown before the blast.

I think that the greatest loss that they suffered
was that of Tom’s jack-knife. He had left it lying
beside the fish that he was in the act of cleaning
when Jack had called to him and he had run out
of the hut. They looked for it every now and
then for several days afterward, digging about the
place where it had been lost; but their hut or cave
in the sand hill had been so completely covered,
and the lay of the hill itself had been so entirely
changed, that they never found it again.

The loss of a jack-knife may seem but a small
thing to tell you, who have only had to slip around
the corner and buy a new one at the nearest[137]
hardware shop. But there was no hardware shop
near to Jack and Tom, and the loss of the jack-knife
was a very great ill to them.

Neither did they ever see the tame sea-gull
again, and they missed the sight of it from the keel
of the upturned boat. I suppose that it must have
been swept away and have perished in the hurricane.



[138]




CHAPTER XII.


AND now a little more than a week had passed
since the great hurricane of which I have just
told you fell upon them. I recollect that it was a
Sunday morning. Sundays were generally spent
in doing no work, and in taking a stroll around the
island. But they had had no rest since the day of
the storm, for the time between then and now had
all been spent in repairing the damages that had
been wrought. Now they were pretty comfortably
settled again, and the day being bright and fair,
they had fixed that it should be spent in taking a
look about them.

It was cool and pleasant, and they strolled
leisurely up the western side of the island, skirting
the belt of Mangrove bushes, around the northern
end, past the barren sand flat, and so down the
Atlantic beach again. By the middle of the afternoon
they had come back to the lower end of the
island, and had gone out on to the spit.

The water that had washed over this place on
the day of the storm had carried away a great deal
of the sand. The surf ran much farther up the
beach, and Tom noticed that the ribs of the wreck[139]
stood higher out of the sand than he had ever seen
them. They did not go farther than the wreck, but
laid themselves down close to it, looking out across
the water toward the distant island that was then
looming to the southward, talking about it and
about their chances of getting to it.

Jack was in a more than usually downhearted
state as to their not being able to get away from the
place that they were on. He said that so far as he
could see, they might have to live there all their
lives and then die, and no one be the wiser of it.
Tom was feeling gloomy himself on this particular
day, and he felt very impatient at poor Jack when he
began his complaining. He felt that if complaints
were to be made, it was he that should make them,
and not Jack, for had he not much more to lose by
staying where he was than the other? I know how
selfish this was, but there are times when we are
given over to spells of selfishness, and, though such
a state may be very wrong, it is yet very natural.

“You might just as well have patience, Jack,”
said he, “We’ve tried to get away already, and
you know what came of it. We certainly can’t
live here forever without sighting a vessel of some
sort at some time or other.”

“We haven’t seen a sign of a ship up to this
time,” said Jack, gloomily.

“That’s very true, and maybe we’ll have to wait
till the war’s over before one comes along. You
know very well that there’s no shipping being done
nowadays.”[140]

“Wait till the war’s over!” cried Jack, raising
himself suddenly on his elbow; “why, heavens and
earth, man, it may be half a dozen years to come,
before the war’s over!”

“Perhaps it may be a dozen years, for all that I
know,” said Tom, “but all the same you’ll have to
wait, so you may just as well keep your tongue still
between your teeth, and be patient about it!”

“Wait?” cried Jack, and he thumped his
clenched fist down on the sand. “By G—I’ll not
wait! I’ll do something; see if I don’t! I’ll not
let any twenty miles of water keep me tied up in
this God-forsaken place! Why don’t you do something?
You’re so full of your d—d contrivances
for making us comfortable; why don’t you puzzle
out some plan for getting us off altogether?”

Tom was lying on the sand, his hands under his
head, and one leg crossed comfortably over the
other. He did not move while Jack was talking,
and he made a point of seeming to be very easy
under it, but he was getting more and more angry
all the time. He did not answer Jack immediately,
but after a while he spoke as quietly as he could.

“You’re unreasonable, Jack,” said he. “Haven’t
I done everything that I could do to get us away;
haven’t I built a raft and put up signals on the sand
hills; haven’t I set a dozen or more bladder-bags
adrift? The chances are that some of them’ll be
picked up, and in good time a ship’ll come to us.
I don’t see that you have any reason to complain,
and if you have reason, you’d better try to do[141]
something yourself;—you’re welcome to it. As for
our getting away;—we’ve tried to get away already,
and you know what came of it. In my opinion we
came so devilish near getting away, that we liked
never to have got back to this or to any other
island.”

“Do you mean to say that you’re so scared at a
little risk that you’re afraid to try it over again?”

“I don’t know about being scared, but I certainly
ain’t going to try it over again.”

“You ain’t?”

“No.”

Jack did not say a word for a little while, but
Tom felt that he was looking at him very hard.
At last he spoke again.

“It’s my belief, Tom Granger,” said he, “that
you haven’t got an ounce of pluck left about you.
I believe that you’re that dull that you’d be content
to live here forever, if you could get enough to fill
your belly!”

This was too much for Tom. He sat up suddenly,
facing the other. “Jack Baldwin,” said he,
and his voice trembled with his anger, “understand
me, once for all. If we’re to live together, or to
talk together, or to have anything to do with one
another, I never want to hear such speech from
your mouth as you’ve just given me; do you
understand me?”

Here he paused for a moment, and then he burst
out passionately: “What do you know how much
I want to get away? Do you suppose that I don’t[142]
want to get away because I don’t keep up an everlasting
whimpering and whining about it, as you
do? What do you want to get away for, anyhow?
Is the only woman that you love in all the world
waiting at home for you, looking for you, and
praying for you, and wondering why she don’t
hear from you—thinking, maybe, that you’re dead.
God help her! I wish that I was dead, and that
she knew it. It would be better for us both, I
guess!” Then he rested his elbows on his knees
and buried his face in his hands, rocking his body
to and fro as he sat.

Jack did not say another word, and in a few
moments Tom heard him get up and walk away.
After a little while Tom got a grip on himself and
looked up again.

Jack was standing just below the wreck and over
toward the ocean. He had gathered what seemed
to be a handful of small, black, flat shells, and he
was busy in skimming them out across the surf.
Presently Tom got up and walked slowly over to
where he was standing. He was heartily ashamed
of the way in which he had spoken to the other,
and would have given a great deal if he could only
have recalled his words; but that is a thing that
can never be done. He stood a little behind Jack,
with his hands in his breeches pockets, looking
down at the sand the while. After a while Jack
spoke, without looking around.

“Look’ee, Tom Granger,” said he, doggedly,
“I’m sorry I spoke to you the way that I did. I[143]
didn’t know that you had a sweetheart at home,—you
ought to ha’ told me before. I’ll never say
any more about getting away, if I have to stay on
this d—d island to the crack of doom, and that I
promise you.”

“That’s all right,” muttered Tom; “don’t let’s
say any more about it.”

One of the round black things that Jack was
skimming out to sea, lay at his feet, and without
knowing what he did, he stooped and picked it up
as he was speaking. He turned it over and over
in his palm in an absent sort of a way, for he was
feeling very uncomfortable at the time.

He turned it over and over, until, after a while,
it worked through his sight into his mind; then he
looked more closely at it, for he had never seen the
like of it before. It was not a shell, neither was it
a pebble, for there were no pebbles on the island.
It was thin and perfectly round, and as black as
ink. On one side of it was a raised surface that
bore a faint likeness to the rude image of a head;
below this was something that looked like a row of
small figures. He brushed it smooth with the palm
of his hand, and then looked more closely at it,
turning it around and around, and this way and
that. All of a sudden a thought struck him, and I
cannot describe the thrill that went through him as
he looked at that which he held. As this thought
went through his mind, he closed his hand and
looked slowly around him, as though he was in a
dream. I can distinctly recollect that that singular[144]
feeling which we all have felt at times passed over
him;—a feeling as though all this had happened
before, but as though it had happened in a dream.
Then he looked at the object once more, and could
just make out the figures;—they were 1, 7, 9 and 2.
He picked at the edge of the disk, and a white
sparkle followed the scratching of his thumb nail.

“Good Lord, Jack!” cried he, “look! look!”

There was a ring in his voice that made Jack
jump as though he had been struck. “Look at
what, Tom?” said he, in a half-frightened voice.

“Look at this!” said Tom, and he held out that
which he had picked up a minute before. “What
do you think it is?”

Jack had three or four of them in his own hand.
“I don’t know,” said he, turning them over and
over. Suddenly he too began to look more closely
at them. “Why, Tom—Tom—” he began, “is it—is
it—”

“It’s money;—it’s silver money, Jack, as sure as
I am a living sinner!”

“Why, so it is!” cried Jack, “why, so it is,
Tom! This is a half a dollar, and so is this, and
this, and this! Why, Tom, here’s another, and
another! Great heavens, Tom! the sand’s covered
with them!”

And so it was. Here and there would be two or
three lying together, but in most cases they were
scattered about like shells at high water mark.
Jack sat down quite overcome, and then began
laughing in a foolish sort of a way, but there was a[145]
catch in his laugh that sounded mightily like crying.
“Tom,” said he, “we’re rich men! Tom, did
you ever see or hear of the like? Why, Tom—”

Then he stopped all of a sudden, and, scrambling
to his feet, fell to gathering up the money as
though he had been crazy.

For an hour or more they hunted up and down,
picking up silver pieces as children pick up chestnuts
under a chestnut tree. After a while they
only found a few stray coins here and there, and
finally they cleared the beach of them altogether.
Then they sat down to count them. Tom had
about two hundred dollars; Jack had gathered
more nearly three hundred than two. Altogether
they had a little less than five hundred dollars
between them.

“Where do you suppose they came from, Tom?”
said Jack, after a while. He was sitting on the
sand when he spoke, holding a lot of the coins in
his hand and turning them over with his fingers.

Tom shook his head. This was the same
thought that had been puzzling him for some time
past, and, as yet, he had not been able to answer it.

After a while they went back to their hut, carrying
their money with them. Jack was very talkative
and excited, but Tom was as silent as the other
was noisy, for he was pondering over the matter of
Jack’s question—Where did they all come from?

Where did they all come from? He thought
and thought till his brain was muddled with his
thinking. Could there have been a treasure buried[146]
here by the buccaneers in times past? It was a wild
thought, but Tom was ready for any kind of wild
thought at the time. But then the date of the coin
that he had found—1792—that was long after the
time of the buccaneers. He picked up another piece
and looked at it; it also bore the same date, 1792,
and so did another and another; they were all of
the same mintage. He did not know what to think
of it.

Jack must have had a notion that Tom was
puzzling his wits over this, for he sat beside the fire
all of the evening without saying a word. Every
now and then he arose and threw some more brushwood
on the flames; beyond that he hardly moved,
but sat in silence, watching Tom furtively.

“Tom,” said he, at last.

“Well, Jack.”

“Do you suppose that it could rain money?”

“Stuff and nonsense!”

“I don’t see any stuff and nonsense about it. I’ve
heard of it raining stones, and why shouldn’t it
rain money as well? We never found any before
that hurricane came on us.”

“That’s true enough, Jack,” said Tom, “I hadn’t
thought of that.” For the finding of this money
had driven all thought of the hurricane out of his
head.

“Then you think it might have rained money,
after all?”

“No; I don’t think that.”

“Humph! Well, what do you think about it?”[147]

“I don’t know what to think about it; but
you’ve put a new idea into my head.”

It was later than usual when they went to rest
that night. Tom laid awake hour after hour, his
thoughts as busy as bees. Where had the money
come from? This was the question that ran
through his brain unceasingly, keeping him awake
as the silent night moved along. And then,
why should all the coins bear the same date of
1792?

Suddenly the whole thing opened before him,
and he saw it all as clearly as I see the hand before
my face. He could hardly help shouting aloud,
but he bethought him that Jack might be asleep,
and that it would be a pity to awaken him.

“Jack,” whispered he, in a low voice.

“Helloa!” said the other, quickly, for he was
wide awake.

“I think I’ve found it out!”

“Found out what?”

“Found where the money came from.”

“Well, where did it come from?” said Jack, and
Tom could see in the gloom that he sat up in his
excitement.

“Did you notice that all the money bore the
same date, 1792?” said Tom.

“No; I didn’t notice that.”

“Well, it did, and, what’s more, it’s all Spanish
money.”

“But where did it come from?” said Jack.

“Jack,” said Tom, slowly, “as sure as I’m lying[148]
here, that wreck on the sand-spit is the wreck of
a Spanish treasure ship.”

“Tom!” shouted Jack, “you’re right! What a
fool I was not to think of that! Why, it’s as plain
as the nose on your face!”

No doubt you who read this have guessed the
matter long ago, and have wondered that Tom and
Jack were so dull of wits as not to have thought of
it before. But the idea never entered their heads
that a fortune was lying buried in the sand that
covered the poor old wreck that had been so
constantly before their eyes for almost a year, and
when they found money like pebbles along the
beach, it never struck them that it could have been
washed out of those crumbling ribs, whose only
value had been that they gave them a rusty spike
every now and then.

Jack was wild to go out into the night, and to
hunt for money there and then, and it was as much
as Tom could do to quiet him and make him lie
down and try to get a little sleep. Of course,
neither of them caught a wink, and both were
stirring at the dawn of day.

They hardly ate a bite of food before they set to
work.

By noontide Tom had made a couple of rude
shovels, the blades of which were of the plankings
of the cutter over their heads, and the handles of
which were two straight limbs, cut from the neighboring
thicket. It was a long tedious piece of
work to make these shovels, for Tom had no tools[149]
to work with but Jack’s knife, and only half of the
blade of that was left. Tom labored steadily at the
shovels, but Jack was very impatient at the slowness
of the work, and was continually urging him to
hurry matters. I suppose that he was back and
forth from the hut to the wreck a dozen times in
the course of the morning.

But at last the shovels were finished. Tom tried
to persuade Jack to eat a bite before he went to
work, but Jack would have nothing to do with
food; he shouldered the two shovels and started
away to the sand-spit, leaving Tom to cook and eat
his dinner by himself. When Tom went over to
the wreck a half an hour later, he found Jack busily
at work, and a great hole already scooped out in
the sand,—but Jack had not yet found a cent of
money.

I do not think that they had any idea of what
they were undertaking, and what a tremendous
piece of work it was that lay before them. I confess
that Tom was as foolish as Jack, in having a notion
that all they would have to do would be to scoop
away a little sand, and pick up money by the handful;
but they found nothing either on that day or
the next, or the next, or for a week or more to
come. Jack began to be very much discouraged,
and said more than once that he was certain that
Tom had been mistaken in his notion that the
wreck was that of a treasure ship.

Tom himself began to be a little down-hearted,
and more than once suspected that he had made[150]
a wrong guess. But when he brought to mind
that the money was of one mintage, and, from the
way in which it lay, that it was plainly washed out
of the wreck by the water that had flowed over the
sand-spit at the time of the hurricane, he would
feel reassured that he was right, though he could
not account for the reason why a part of it should
have been washed up, while the rest seemed to lie
so deeply beneath the surface. So he managed to
keep Jack pretty steadily to his work, though, as
the days dragged along and nothing came of their
labor, it became a great task to do so.

But on the tenth day they made a find. They
were just about to give up their work for the evening,
when Tom unearthed a small, wooden box.
It was about a foot long, six inches wide, and three
or four inches deep. It was very rotten, and fell to
pieces as Jack tried to pick it up. It was full of
money, which tumbled all in a heap as the box
crumbled in Jack’s hand. The money must have
been in rolls when it was put into the case, for
there were scraps of mouldy paper mixed with it,
and some of the coins had bits of paper glued to
them by the black rust that had gathered upon
them.

This was the first money that they found by
digging, and Jack nearly went crazy over it. Tom
himself was very much excited, but he did not act
as absurdly as Jack, who danced, and laughed, and
shouted like one possessed. It was their first
gleam of good luck, and it was a good thing that[151]
it came when it did, for it was speedily followed by
the worst of ill fortune.

That night there came a south-east storm that
did great damage. It had been brewing all of the
afternoon, but Tom and Jack had not seen it, or, if
they had seen it, had thought nothing of it, for
heretofore the wash of the surf had never run as far
up as the wreck, even in the heaviest weather. But
so much of the sand had been carried away that
the surf came a great deal higher than it had done
before. It was blowing quite heavily when Tom
and Jack went over to the sand-spit the next morning,
and a part of the wash of the breakers had
found its way into the place that they had been
digging, so that the sand had caved in here and
there. They tried to do all that they could to
protect their work, but it was no good, for, by the
time that evening had come, the place that they
had dug out was half full of sand, and by the next
morning it was nearly levelled over, and all of their
labor was to be done again. As soon as the storm
was over they set to work, and in a week’s time
had the sand nearly all dug out. Then came
another blow, and the same thing happened as
before.

After this they set about the work with more
system. They built a breakwater of stakes, between
which they wove twigs and grass. This was Tom’s
plan, and they found that it kept the sea back
completely, for, as I have said, it was only the wash
of the breakers that ran over the place that they[152]
were at work. It never filled up again as long as
Tom and Jack were engaged upon it.

But all this cost a great deal of time and labor,
and I doubt very much if they had not found the
box of money whether they would ever have struck
a shovel into the sand again after the first storm
came upon them; so that it was a lucky thing that
they found the box when they did, and that the
southeaster did not come a day sooner.

For three or four months they worked as never
men worked before. It is strange to think of how
men will labor and toil for money, even when
money will do them as little good as it did Jack
and Tom on this lonely island. It is a wonder that
they did not kill themselves with the work and the
hardships that they went through during that time.
However, the excitement that they were living
under kept them up to a great degree.

During all these months they lived upon little
else than fish. Now and then they would gather a
few mussels or catch a crab or two, but their chief
living was fish—broiled fish for breakfast, dinner and
supper, until they both grew to loathe the very
sight of it. Tom got such a surfeit of them in that
time that he could never bear the smell of a frying
fish from that day to this.

Upon the first of September they counted over
the money that they had unearthed, and they found
that they had over eight thousand dollars in all.
It was made up of silver coins of all sizes, large
and small.[153]

They only had three days more of work on the
island, and, as two of those days were blank, they
did not add very much to the sum that they had
already gathered.



[154]




CHAPTER XIII.


IT was the morning of the 3d of September of
the same year,—1814.

Tom and Jack had just finished their breakfast;—it
was of broiled fish. Hughy! It makes me
shudder even now to think of it, for I do hate the
very sight of a fish.

The work of digging at the wreck had settled
down to a very jog-trot business by this time.
Neither of the men were in a hurry to quit their
comfortable seat on the sand and turn to hard work,
that had lost all the savor of novelty it had had at
first. The first day that they had struck shovel
into the sand above the wreck, Jack had started off
eagerly, without eating a bite; he was quite willing
to eat a meal now,—even a meal of broiled fish—and
to take a goodly while to the eating of it also.
So they both sat dwadling over their unsavory
food, not at all anxious to make a start.

“Well, Jack,” said Tom, at last; “I suppose that
we might as well be stirring.”

“I reckon we might,” said Jack, and then he
stretched himself, as a first step toward getting up.

At that moment a sound fell upon their ears. It[155]
was not one to which you would have given a
second thought, and yet if it had been a clap of
thunder out of a clear sky, it could not have
startled the two more than it did.

When they had rebuilt their hut after it had been
destroyed by the great hurricane, they had not
located in the same spot in which they had lived
before. An eddy of the wind had scooped a hollow
out of the side of the sand hill, and it was in the
side of this cup-shaped hollow that they had digged
their house, and had roofed it in with the cutter as
they had done before; for they thought that they
would be more sheltered in this spot if another
hurricane should come upon them. Looking from
this hollow in front of them, they could see nothing
but a part of the western ocean and the upper end
of the sand-spit, whereupon they worked from day
to day. It was just back of them, and from the
crest or brim of this sandy bowl that the sound
came that startled them so greatly.

It was the sound of a man’s voice.

“Ahoy there!”

For a moment Jack and Tom looked at one
another without turning around. This minute I
can see just how Jack stared at Tom; his mouth
agape, and his eyes as big as saucers. But it was
only for a moment that they sat looking at one
another so amazedly, for the next instant they
jumped to their legs and turned around.

A burly red-faced man was standing on the crest
of the white sand hill, his figure sharply marked[156]
against the blue sky behind him. His hands were
thrust deeply into his breeches pockets, and he stood
with his legs a little apart. He had a short cutty
pipe betwixt his teeth;—the bowl was turned topsey-turvey,
and there was no light in it. When he saw
that Tom and Jack were looking at him, he spoke
again, without taking the pipe from out his mouth.

“Are you fellows the first and second mates of
the Nancy Hazlewood, privateersman?”

Jack nodded his head.

The man turned and beckoned two or three times,
and then came slowly and carefully down the steep
side of the sand dun, half sliding, half stumbling.
The first thing that he said when he came to where
they were, was:

“I just tell you what it is, mates; that mess of
fish smells mighty good.” Then he asked which
of them was the first mate.

“I’m the first mate,” said Jack.

By this time three or four heads rose above the
crest of the hill, and a little knot of sailors gathered
on the top of the dun; then they came jumping
and sliding and stumbling down to where the others
were standing.

But all this time Tom was like one in a dream.
I think that he must have been dazed by the
suddenness of the coming of that for which he
had longed so bitterly and so deeply. He tried to
realize that they were rescued; that these men were
about to take them away; that they were really to
leave the island that had been their prison for so[157]
many long and weary days, and that in a few weeks
at the furthest, he would be in Eastcaster again,
and would see Patty, and would be talking with
her of all these things. Many a time in the silence
of the lonely night, he had pictured their rescue to
himself, and in the sleep that followed, he had
perhaps dreamed that a boat was lying on the beach
below their hut, and then had wakened to the
bitterness of its being only a dream. But now that
rescue had in truth come to them, he could no
more realize it than you or I can realize that we are
really to see the other world, some time to come.
So he stood leaning against the poor old shattered
cutter that had sheltered Jack and him for so long,
and as he leaned there he looked about him, wondering
dully, whether or not he would not awaken
in a few minutes and find this too to be only a
dream. He heard the man who had hailed them,
telling Jack that he was the first mate of the barque
Baltimore, of Baltimore, and that they were bound
for New York from Key West, having run fifty
miles out of their course to pick them up at this
island. He heard him ask Jack which one of
them had set the bladder of porpoise hide adrift,
that the Baltimore had picked up off the Florida
coast, and saw that Jack jerked his thumb toward
him, and that the mate of the Baltimore was
looking at him, and was saying that it was a
d—d clever Yankee trick. He saw the sailors
crowding around, looking here and there; peeping
and prying into the doorway of the hut, and talking[158]
amongst themselves. “Blast my eyes, Tommy,
look at this here shanty!” “Well, I’m cussed if
they hain’t got a ship’s boat slung up for a roof!”
“Damme! look at his beard and hair; (this in a
hoarse whisper) he’s the second mate, Bill;—Granger,
you know.”

Then he heard Jack ask the mate of the Baltimore
for a chew of tobacco. He cut off the piece of the
plug with his old broken jack-knife, and Tom
watched him doing it as though it was a matter of
the greatest moment to him. I can recollect that
he thought dully how Jack must enjoy his tobacco
after having been so long without it.

After a while there was a movement, and he
heard Jack calling to him to come along, as they
were all going over to the boat, but it was still in
the same dazed state that he walked along the
beach with the others until they came around the
end of the sand hills, saw the bay open before him,
and the barque floating like a swan upon the
smooth surface of the water. A ship’s boat was
lying high and dry on the sand of the beach, and
two sailors were sitting in the stern, smoking comfortably
and talking together. They tumbled out
of the boat and stood looking as the others drew
near, and Tom thought what a strange sight Jack
and he must be—ragged, tattered, patched, half-naked,
with beards reaching to their breasts, and
heads uncovered, excepting for the mat of hair that
hung as low as their shoulders. He had not
thought of their looking strange before this.[159]

So they reached the boat, and Tom stood for a
moment looking down into it and at the oars lying
along the thwarts within. Then he and Jack and
Mr. Winterbury (the first mate) climbed in and the
boat was shoved off, grating on the sand as it
moved into the water. There was a rattle of oars
dropped into the rowlocks, and then the regular
“chug! chug!” of the rowing. He looked back
and saw the island and the beach and the white sand
hills that he knew so well dropping slowly astern.
It seemed very strange to be looking at them from
the ocean. At last they were close to where the
barque was slowly rising and falling upon the
heaving of the ground swell that came rolling in
around the point of the sandy hook beyond. This
is the way in which their rescue came.

As they swept under the lee of the barque Mr.
Winterbury stood up in the stern sheets of the
boat. There were a row of faces looking down at
them from the forecastle, and two or three sailors
were standing on the bulwarks, holding on to the
shrouds. They, too, were looking down into the
boat. Two men were standing near to the break
of the poop. One of them was a handsome young
fellow of about twenty; the other was a tall, rather
loose-jointed man, somewhat round-shouldered, and
a little past the prime of life. He had his hands
clasped behind him, and he hailed the first mate as
soon as the cutter came alongside.

“Did you find them all safe and sound, Mr.
Winterbury?”[160]

“Yes, sir; safe and sound.”

Mr. Winterbury went up the side first, and Jack
and Tom followed close at his heels. They were
met by Captain Williamson as soon as they had
stepped upon the deck. He shook hands with
them, and immediately asked them to step into the
cabin, for he must have seen that it was trying to
them to be stared at by all of the ship’s crew.
There was a decanter of Madeira and three glasses
on the cabin table. Captain Williamson bade Tom
and Jack be seated, and then sat down himself.
He filled one of the glasses, and then passed the
decanter to the others, bidding them to fill likewise,
which they did.

It may not be out of place here to give you a
description of Captain Williamson. He was one
of the skippers of the last century, the like of
which we rarely, if ever, see nowadays. He was
part owner in the craft that he sailed, and made a
good thing of it. He came of an old Annapolis
family, and was a courteous, kindly, Christian gentleman,
though stiff and formal in his manners. He
fancied that he looked like General Washington,
and it was a weakness of his to act and carry himself
as nearly as he could after the manner of the
General, who, by the by, was a distant relative or
connection, though by marriage, if I mistake not.
Another weakness of his was a fancy that he would
have made a great naval captain if he had only had
the opportunity.

As it was, he had never smelt fighting powder in[161]
all his life; nor was he likely to do so, for, though
no coward, he was cautious and careful in the
extreme, and would never willingly have entered
into action, even with a fighting bum-boat. He
always wore a cocked hat, like an admiral, knee-breeches,
buckles and pumps, and when he was
standing still rested mainly on one foot, with his
hands clasped behind him and the knee of the
other leg bent, just as General Washington always
stands in the pictures that one sees of him.

So he sat now, with one knee crossed over the
other, very stiff and straight, just as General Washington
might have sat if he had been sitting in the
cabin.

“May I ask which of you is the first mate?”
said he.

“I’m the first mate, sir,” said Jack.

“Mr. Baldwin, I believe?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Was it you, sir, who conceived the extremely
ingenious and clever plan of sending bags or bladders
of porpoise hide afloat, with your condition
and location inclosed within them?”

“No, sir,” said Jack, “it was my mate here,”
and he chucked his thumb toward Tom.

“It was a very clever thought—very clever indeed,”
said Captain Williamson, turning to Tom.
“How did you get that black substance with which
it was covered?”

“We mixed the porpoise blubber with soot,”
said Tom.[162]

The captain nodded his head. “Very clever
indeed,” said he again, “it was very efficacious, for
the bladder was quite covered with the substance
when we picked it up—so much so, indeed, that my
fingers were thoroughly befouled in the handling
of it. And was it you, also, who made the map of
the island?”

“Yes, sir,” said Tom again.

Then Captain Williamson nodded his head once
more, and said for the third time: “Very clever—very
clever, indeed.” Then he told Tom that the
Baltimore had picked up the bladder off the Florida
coast. “It was,” said he, “but fifty miles out of
my course to come to this island, for I am bound
for New York harbor. I recognized the situation
of the island from the plan of it found enclosed in
the bladder.”

“It was a kind and Christian act on your part,”
said Tom. “Very few captains would have run
fifty miles out of their course to pick up two poor
souls, ’specially while so many British cruisers are
about. I and my mate—”

Here he stopped, for a great lump rose in his
throat until it seemed to choke him.

“Tut! tut! tut! tut!” said Captain Williamson,
holding up his hand deprecatingly; “it was no
more than one Christian man ought to do for
another. Say no more of that, I beg of you.
There are many questions that I wish to ask of you
in reference to the loss of the Nancy Hazlewood,
but I will not trouble you with questions just at[163]
this season. I will beg of you to give such an
account, however, after you are refreshed with
clean linen and clothes, and what not.”

As Captain Williamson paused for a moment
Tom looked at Jack, and saw that he fidgeted restlessly
in his chair when the other spoke of the
Nancy Hazlewood. There was a great deal about
her loss that would be very difficult and very bitter
to tell.

“In the meantime,” said Captain Williamson,
resuming his speech, “you need have no anxiety
about anything that you may desire to fetch away
from the island with you, for I have sent a boat
ashore under my second mate, Mr. Bright. He
will see that everything is brought safely away
from your hut or cabin. So, as I said, you need
have no anxiety on that score.”

At these words Jack and Tom sprung to their
feet, for the thought struck them both at once that
their money would be found, and that in an hour’s
time every man aboard of the ship would not only
know that the two castaways had been digging for
treasure, but would also know where that treasure
had been found. It would be no secret then, but
would be known to all, and there was no telling
what such knowledge might bring with it. It was
a thing that no one but the captain or the chief
officers of the ship should be aware of just at the
present time.

“Captain Williamson,” cried Jack, “for the love
of heaven, don’t let that boat go ashore just yet![164]
Tom, you speak to him, you’re blessed with the
gift of talk; speak to him, and tell him about the
mon—, about you know what.”

“Yes, captain,” cried Tom, “for heaven’s sake
don’t let the boat go ashore till we tell you something
first.”

Captain Williamson had also risen to his feet.
He seemed to be very much amazed at their words.
“Why not? Why shouldn’t the boat go ashore?”
said he. “What does all this mean?”

“Has the boat left the ship yet, captain?” said
Tom.

“Yes; the boat has left the ship; but what does
all this mean, I say?”

“Then, stop it—call it back!” cried Tom.

Jack was walking up and down, patting his
clenched fist in his excitement. “I’ll tell you what
it means,” he blurted out; “it means that there’s
nigh to nine thousand dollars in silver money in
that hut, and that the crew of the boat mustn’t find
it there.”

“Nine thousand dollars!” repeated Captain Williamson;
and then he stopped and stood glaring at
the two men as though he doubted he had heard
aright.

“Yes,” said Jack, thumping his fist down on the
table, “nine thousand dollars, and if you let that
boat’s crew find it, and find where it came from,
you’ll be chucking a fortune from your own hands
into their pockets. For heaven’s sake, stop the
boat—call it back!”[165]

Then Captain Williamson stepped quickly to the
door and flung it open. “Mr. Winterbury!” cried
he, sharply.

“Aye, aye, sir!”

“Call the cutter back!”

“Call the—”

“Call the cutter back!”

“Aye, aye, sir!”

There was a pause, and then Tom and Jack
heard the bellow of the mate’s voice in the trumpet:

“Cutter ahoy-y-y-y!”

Captain Williamson stood with his head out of
the cabin door, and presently they heard him ask:

“Do they hear you, sir?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Then signal them back.”

“Aye, aye, sir!”

Then Captain Williamson drew in his head, shutting
the door carefully, and resumed his seat. He
passed his hand over his face, and crossed his
knees, and then put on his Washingtonian air
again. I think that he was half ashamed of the
excitement that had driven him out of it a moment
before.

“Now, Mr. Granger,” said he, “since Mr. Baldwin
has called upon you to be the spokesman, will you
tell me what all this means?”

“Yes, sir; I will,” said Tom. “Of course, you
will have to know everything, after what has
passed; but I should have told you of it anyhow,
for I put much trust in your honor.”[166]

“You are perfectly right to do so,” said Captain
Williamson. “Sit down, if you please.”

Then the two sat down again, and Tom began
his story. Captain Williamson did not say a word
to interrupt him, but every now and then he looked
sharply from Tom to Jack, and from Jack back
again to Tom. He sat with his elbows on the
arms of his chair, and the tips of his fingers just
touching each other; but he did not move a muscle,
excepting as he turned his head when he looked
first at one, and then at the other.

At last Tom had made an end of the story. Captain
Williamson did not move for a second or two,
but he sat just as he had been doing all along. Then
he drew a deep breath, and arose from his chair. He
took a turn or two up and down the cabin; then he
stopped suddenly in front of Tom and Jack.

“This is an extraordinary—a most extraordinary
tale,” said he. “I never heard the like in all my
life. It’s like a tale in a romance, and I can
scarcely believe that I have heard aright. That
you should find a treasure on this—”

Here he stopped abruptly and looked sharply
from one to the other. “Surely, there can be
nothing false and underhand in all this,” he said.

“I suppose the story does sound strange to you,”
said Tom. “I reckon that it’s because we’re so
used to it that it don’t seem as though it ought to
be strange. It’s the truth, though, captain. There
wouldn’t be any use in our telling you a lie, for
you can easily prove the truth of it for yourself.”[167]

“True, true,” said he, and then he began walking
up and down the cabin again. “What do you
intend to do about the matter now?” said he,
stopping for a moment, and turning to the others.

Tom and Jack looked at one another.

“I’ll leave the whole thing to you, Tom,” said
Jack. “It was you who found the money—at
least, it was you that found out where it was. I
suppose it ought all to belong to you, by rights.”

“That’s all nonsense, Jack,” said Tom. “It was
you who found it first; but even if you hadn’t,
we’re mates, and it’s share and share alike between
us.”

“Well, I reckon that’s no more than fair,” said
Jack, “but it don’t matter in this case; I’ll leave
the whole thing to you.”

Tom sat lost in thought for a few moments. At
last he spoke: “I’d make this proposal,” said he;
“that we put the whole thing in the hands of
Captain Williamson, leaving him to do what he
thinks best in the matter, only having him guarantee
to share all gains that shall come from it with
us. It seems to me that we certainly owe as much
as this to him, and that it’s the least that we can do.
What do you think, Jack?”

Jack hesitated for a moment. “Well,” said he,
“I suppose that it’s no more than what’s right.”

“I think not,” said Tom. “What do you say
about it, captain?”

“It’s for you to say,” said Captain Williamson.
“Of course, I’ll be glad to go into the matter with[168]
you, but I wish you to understand that I don’t
want you to feel that any money is due me because
I ran a few miles out of my course to pick you up.
That was no more than one man could be expected
to do for another. If I come into this, it must be
on purely business grounds, and not as a gift of
gratitude from you.”

“Very well,” said Tom. “What do you think
would be fair terms between us?”

“If you have no objections, I would like to talk
with my first mate about it,” said Captain Williamson.

Jack and Tom looked at one another again.

“Do you think that there’s any special need of
his knowing about it?” said Jack. “It seems to
me that we’re taking in a good many. It’s all
right that you should share with us, seeing that
you’ve treated us in such a handsome manner. I
acknowledge that very few captains would have
sailed out of their course in times of war for the
sake of picking up a couple of poor, shipwrecked
devils, with nothing to be gained by it, and, apart
from the business part of it, I think likely that we
owe that much to you; but I don’t see why the
mate should be taken in, too.”

“I don’t know that he will expect to be ‘taken
in,’” said Captain Williamson, somewhat coldly,
“but I think that you’ll find his advice in the matter
will be of help to you. You may rely upon it that
the secret will be as safe with him as it will be with
me.”[169]

“All right,” said Jack; “if Tom don’t care, I
don’t, either.”

So Mr. Winterbury was called into the cabin, and
Tom told the story of the finding of the treasure
all over again.

“What do you think of it, Mr. Winterbury?” said
Captain Williamson, when Tom had ended.

“I think it’s the most extraordinary yarn that
ever I heard in all my life.”

“Exactly my thought. And now, if Mr. Baldwin
and Mr. Granger will excuse us for a moment or two,
I would like to have a few words with you outside.”
Then they went out, and Jack and Tom were left
alone.

“It seems to me that you did rather too much,
Tom,” said Jack.

“I think it was as little as we could do,” said
Tom. “They’ve sailed fifty miles out of their
course to pick us up, without expecting so much as
a red cent for it, so I think it was as little as we
could do.”

“Oh, all right; I’m not finding fault,” said Jack.
“I don’t mean to find any fault at all; I was only
giving you my notion about it. I’m satisfied.”

But it was very plain, from the way in which
he spoke, that he was not satisfied.

In a little while Captain Williamson and Mr.
Winterbury came into the cabin again. Then the
captain asked a number of questions about the
wreck—how much of it they had already uncovered,
etc., etc.[170]

“We’ve uncovered a little less than one quarter
of it, I should judge,” said Tom, looking to Jack
for confirmation.

Jack nodded his head.

Then Captain Williamson told them what his
idea was about it. That he did not think that the
wreck was that of a treasure ship, as they had not
found money enough in it for that; that he had no
doubt that the vessel had been carrying newly-minted
money to some one of the Spanish provinces
when she had been cast on the beach—probably
in a south-easterly gale. From what they had
already found, he thought that there might have
been from forty to fifty thousand dollars in her all
together, and that there might be from thirty to
forty thousand dollars yet left under the sand. He
said that he would undertake to find the rest of the
money, and that he would send or take out a ship
stocked with provisions for that purpose, the expense
of which he would bear himself. That all wages
and expenses above that should be paid out of the
money that they should find, and that the net gain
should be shared equally between them, each taking
a third. “Or,” said he, in conclusion, “I will buy
either or both of your interests out, accepting all the
risks myself. I will give you each six thousand dollars
for your share in the venture, for which I offer a
note payable at ninety days, with safe indorsement.”
He then said that he would give them a week to
think over the offer he had made, and would be glad
to hear anything that they might have to propose.[171]

I will say here, that at the end of a week they
had made up their minds to run their chances of
what might be found, and that it paid them to do so.

A little later in the morning Captain Williamson
and Mr. Winterbury and Jack and Tom went ashore
in the captain’s gig. They left the gig and the crew
of it a little distance up the beach, while they four
walked down to the hut, Tom and Jack carrying a
small sea-chest between them, in which to store the
money that was hidden under a pile of brush-wood
in the cabin. Then they went out on the sand-spit
to inspect the wreck, and Captain Williamson
renewed the offer that he had made in the cabin of
the Baltimore, and said again that they might take
a week to think it over.

Then they tore down the breakwater that Tom
and Jack had built, so that the sea might make in
during the next storm, and so hide the work that
they had done. After this they went back to the
gig, and Captain Williamson sent four of the men
to the hut for the chest of money.

So, at last, their life upon the island came to an
end.

They had a safe and quick journey home, entering
Sandy Hook on the 20th of the month. They
were quarantined for a couple of days through some
delay, and landed in New York on the 23d.

During the voyage home, Jack gave Captain
Williamson an account of the loss of the Hazlewood.
The captain looked very serious over it; he
did not say anything, but he shook his head. He[172]
evidently thought that it was a very shady piece of
business.

The day after they landed in New York, Jack
and Tom took stage to Philadelphia, which they
reached a little after noon of the 26th.

You all know what followed. The Board of
Trade appointed a committee to inquire into the
circumstances of the loss of the ship Nancy Hazlewood.
Tom did not write a letter home, because
he expected that every day would be his last in
town; but the investigation dragged along until
more than a week had been consumed by the
committee.

Both Tom and Jack were blamed, because that
they had come off with their lives, while the captain
and most of the crew had gone down in the ship.
Mr. Blakie, of the firm of Blakie &amp; Howard, said
some particularly bitter and cutting things, which
might have stung Tom very sharply if he had not
felt that, by rights, there was not much blame resting
upon him.

Mr. Blakie’s words were meant as much for him
as they were for Jack, for it was not known that
Tom had been taken off the vessel against his will.
Jack did not breathe a word of this, and Tom was
too proud to seem to want to slip from under the
blame, and leave Jack to bear it all. Jack did not
say in so many words that Tom had joined him in
deserting the ship in the cutter, but what he did say
would have led any reasonable man to infer as
much. It is quite natural that a man should dislike[173]
to carry all of a load of blame on his own shoulders,
and there is a great satisfaction in knowing that
others share the burden; at the same time, it would
have been a good thing for Tom, if Jack had spoken
out and told the whole truth, for, as it turned out,
it weighed in the balance against him when every
scruple told.

But at last the committee dismissed Tom, and he
was free to go; little he cared then of their favorable
or unfavorable opinion, for the time had come
when he might go home.

There was just time to catch the morning stage
for Eastcaster, and in half an hour he was rumbling
out of Philadelphia, mounted, pipe in mouth, on
the outside of the Union stage, with his boxes and
bundles safely stowed away in the boot.



[174][175]





[176][177]
PART III




CHAPTER XIV.


IT seemed to Tom, now that he was fairly on the
homeward road, as though the wheels of the
stage were weighted with lead, and as though the
horses that dragged it crawled at a snail’s pace, for
his hopes and his longing for home outstripped a
thousand fold the rate of his traveling.

To P., 18 M.—14 M. to E.; to P., 19 M.—13 M.
to E.; to P., 20 M.—12 M. to E. So passed the
milestones in succession, and Tom counted every
one as they rumbled by it. But at last it was 2 M.
to E., and a steep hill lay in front of them; it was
the last hill between him and home.

Tom had taken the Union line of stages, which
did not, like the Enterprise line, run on to Downeyville,
but stopped at Eastcaster. The driver of
“No. 3” was a stranger to Tom; old Willy Wilkes
had heretofore driven the stage as long as he could
remember.

“Where’s old Willy Wilkes?” said Tom, soon
after they had left Philadelphia.

The strange driver let fly an amber stream of
tobacco juice over the side of the coach, and answered,
briefly, “Dead.”[178]

“Dead!”

“Ya-as. Caught cold last spring and died in
June;” then, with some curiosity, “Did you know
him?”

“Yes, I knew him,” said Tom, briefly. Here was
the first change, and it threw a cloud over him;
was he to find other changes as great? He had
only been gone a year and a half, but it seemed to
him as though it might have been ten years. There
was a pause of a few minutes, and the new driver of
“No. 3” looked furtively at Tom from out the
corners of his eyes. Tom had not cut off his beard,
and his hair had turned iron grey in the last five
months; he knew that he was greatly changed.

It was Tom’s beard that seemed to catch the
driver’s eye, for folks went clean-shaven in those
days.

“I allow you’re from foreign parts,” said he, at
last.

“Yes; I’m from foreign parts,” said Tom, shortly.
Nothing more was said between them after this.
Tom sat buried in thoughts and the driver sat chewing
vigorously at his quid of tobacco, looking steadfastly
over the leader’s ears the whiles.

So they began the slow climbing of the last
hill; they reached the top of the rise, and then
the country lay spread out before them, hill and
valley, field, meadow-land and wood, all brown
and golden in the mellow autumn sunlight. The
houses clustered more thickly about the village, and
over the rusting foliage peeped the white spire of[179]
St. James’ Church. A lump arose in Tom’s throat
at the sight of the dear old place, and his eyeballs
felt hot and dry. Then a keen and sudden thrill
shot through him, for, away beyond the village and
over to the right, he could see the yellow sunlight
shining on the white walls of a house. Close to it
stood an old stone mill and back of it was an apple
orchard. Then Tom felt, indeed, that his darling
was near to him.

The driver gathered up his reins. “Click!”
said he, and the coach dashed down the hill, and
house and mill were hidden from Tom’s sight.
So they reached the level road and went rumbling
along it; they turned the corner and Eastcaster was
before them. The scattered houses grew thicker
and thicker; they turned another corner sharply
and were in Market street.

Everything was the same as when Tom had last
seen them: trees, houses, stores, people, everything.
Shipwreck, death, loneliness and misery had been
around him for a year and a half, and yet Eastcaster
was the same as though he had not come back to
it through the valley of the shadow of death. It
seemed strange to him that it should be so; it was
as though he had left everything but yesterday.
Here was Pepperill’s store, there the blacksmith
shop. They passed Parkinson’s tobacco store; a
number of men were sitting on chairs around the
door in the sunshine. They looked up at the
stage with dull interest. Tom knew them all, but
not one of them recognized him. A little further[180]
along, on the opposite side of the street, was Mr.
Moor’s office. As they rumbled by it, Tom saw
that two men were standing at the window looking
absently into the street; one of them was Mr. Moor,
the other was Isaac Naylor. A thrill darted through
him when he saw Isaac Naylor; it was strange
that the sight of his former rival should seem to
bring Patty so near to him. The two men looked
at the stage as it passed, but they saw nothing, for
their minds were evidently fixed upon other things.
Mr. Moor was talking, looking anxious and worried;
Isaac Naylor was listening, cold and impassive.

Tom noticed this in the moment that he was
passing.

Then the stage stopped, for it was in front of the
Crown and Angel, and Black Jim—the identical
Black Jim that Tom had left a year and a half
ago, who was standing out in the road, waiting the
coming of the stage—loosened the straps at the
horses’ necks. The passengers tumbled out from
the inside, and Tom got down from the box, and
stood looking about him. There were a group of
loungers sitting along the tavern porch in the
warm sunlight; their feet on the railing, and their
chairs tilted back. Tom knew nearly all of them,
but they did not recognize him;—he never fully
realized till then, how changed he was in his
appearance. Even Mrs. Bond, the landlady, who
was standing at the door with her hands under her
apron, did not know him.[181]

Some one came walking along the street and
stopped, for a moment, to look at the stage—it was
Will Gaines. “He’ll know me, at least,” said Tom,
to himself, but he did not; he looked at Tom, but
there was no other light than that of curiosity in
his eyes.

“Will,” said he, at last; “Will Gaines, don’t you
know me?”

Then sudden recognition flashed into Will’s face.
He stood for a moment as though bereft of speech;
then he strode forward, and clutched Tom by the
shoulder.

“My God! Tom Granger; is it—is it you? They
said you were dead! I—I—” Then he stopped,
and Tom felt his hands trembling as they lay on
his shoulders.

“Dead!” said Tom, after a moment of silence.

“Yes, Tom; dead.”

“But I’m not dead,” said Tom, smiling, and trying
to shake off the feeling that was creeping over
him.

“Don’t! Don’t talk that way, Tom,” said Will;
“don’t make so light of it. Your father had a
letter from Lovejoy &amp; Co., of Philadelphia. It was
nearly a year ago, now; the letter said that your
ship had been lost, no one knew how or where.
Tom,”—here he stopped abruptly—“Come into the
tavern, Tom,” said he.

As they went up the tavern steps and entered the
door, the loungers stared at them with wide-opened
eyes. They did not recognize him, but a stranger[182]
was an object of interest in the town in those days.
Will hurried him into the house, and Mrs. Bond
showed them into the parlor. There was something
so odd in Will’s manner, that the feeling of
fear grew heavier and heavier on Tom’s spirit—the
first words that he spoke, were:

“Will, how’s Patty?”

Will did not answer immediately, and Tom,
glancing quickly up, saw that he was looking
earnestly at him.

There was a moment of dead silence, through
which sounded the clicking of the dishes being
washed in the out kitchen of the tavern.

“Will, how’s Patty?” said Tom, again, and he
himself noticed what a sharp ring there was in his
voice. “Why don’t you speak? What’s the
matter? How’s Patty?”

“Patty?”

“Yes; Patty.”

“Patty? Oh! Patty’s all right.”

Tom looked at him very keenly. His heart was
crumbling within him, though he could not tell
why. He felt faint and ill, and leaned heavily on
the table near him. He looked out of the window,
watching Black Jim watering the stage horses at
the trough in the stable-yard; then, without looking
back at Will, he steadied himself for the next question.

“I’m no coward, Will,” said he; “you see I’ve
gone through enough this year to turn my hair
grey, and I’m no coward now, if I ever was before.[183]
I want you to tell me the truth; is—is Patty
dead?”

“Dead! No; of course she isn’t dead. She
was very much broken down when she heard of the
loss of the ship that you sailed in; but she’s all
right now,—well and hearty.”

“And she’s not sick—nothing the matter with
her?”

“Nothing.”

Tom put his hand to his forehead, for things were
swimming around him; then he gave a short laugh,
but there was a quaver in it. “You frightened me
pretty badly, Will,” said he; “I don’t deny that I
felt as though you were dragging my heart out by
the roots.”

“See here, Tom, you don’t look well,” said Will;
“let me call for a glass of brandy for you.”

“I don’t want any brandy; I wouldn’t mind
having a drop of water, though.” There was a
pitcher standing on the table beside him; he tilted
it and looked into it and saw that there was water
in it; then he raised it to his lips and took a deep
draught of it. “What did you scare me so for?”
he said, half angrily, turning on Will again.

“I didn’t mean to scare you, Tom,” said the
other; then he hesitated for a moment or two.
“Look here, Tom,” said he, “you’d better go home;
your mother has something to tell you. Your
father was in town not half an hour ago; I saw him
at Bradley’s blacksmith shop. I wish to heavens
you’d been a little sooner; you might have ridden[184]
out home with him. If you’ll wait a bit, I’ll slip
over and borrow uncle’s gig and drive you home.”

“I don’t want to wait; I’ll walk,” said Tom.
Then, “Look here, Will; what are you so anxious
for me to go straight home for?”

“What makes you think that I’m anxious?”

“You ain’t answering my question, Will Gaines.”

“I have no reason for wanting you to go straight
home, except that I suppose your folks’ll want to
see you.”

“Is that all?” said Tom, looking sharply at the
other.

“Yes.”

Tom looked at him a little while longer, and
then he turned away. He did not believe Will, but
he saw that nothing more was to be gotten out of
him.

“I’ll tell you what I’ll do,” said Will, presently,
“you walk on out home, and I’ll go over and get
uncle’s gig and drive after you, and pick you up.
It won’t do to run in on your people without their
knowing of your coming. Your mother ought to
know of it before she sees you.”

This was all very true, though Tom felt that
Will’s plan was laid in order to secure his going
home without stopping. He said nothing of his
thoughts, however, but left the tavern, and started
for home.

He walked briskly along the dusky turnpike
road, but there was a dull feeling of unhappiness
resting upon his heart, for Will’s words, and looks,[185]
and tones, all told him that there was something
wrong. So he came at last to the foot of the hill,
where the turnpike road crosses Stony-Brook by
the old county bridge. On the other side of the
stream is a by-road that leads off from the highway
and runs through the woods. Tom knew it well,
for it was the old mill road, and led to Elihu Penrose’s
house. Many a time had he walked it, and
well he knew every bend and turn of it. The last
time he had passed along it his heart had beaten
high with love, and hope, and high resolve, albeit
there was the bitterness of a coming parting lurking
at the bottom of it. When he came to the spot
where the mill road opens on the pike he stood
still, and, as he stood, all the fear that had rested
upon him since his homecoming seemed to gather
and intensify into a dark and nameless dread.
What had happened? What could it all mean?

As his fears grew stronger his love waxed
stronger with them. He looked back along the
turnpike road—there was no signs of Will Gaines.
Why should he go home, and not see his own dear
love the first of all? “God bless her!” said he,
with quivering lips, “I’ll not go home first; I’ll go
and see her—my darling!”

So he left the highway, and walked down the road
through the woods. The brown leaves that were
beginning to fall rustled beneath his feet, and the
yellow patches of sunlight slid over his head and
shoulders as he walked beneath the shadow of the
grey trees along the roadside.[186]

Then he came out of the woods and into the open
sunlight again. Now he was on the grass-bordered
foot-path; on one side of him was the white dusty
road, and on the other the mill-race, with the row
of pollard willows standing along it. In front of
him were the white walls of the mill-house, with
the vines clustered around the end of the old well-remembered
porch, just as he had seen them last.
As he came closer he saw a slender girl’s figure
sitting in a high-backed rocking chair, half hidden
by the net-work of the vines around her.

It was Patty.

Tom’s heart gave a great leap within him; then
stood still, and then began to beat furiously. He
paused for a moment, gazing at her, his hand
resting on the top of the picket fence in front of
the garden; then he went forward again, but very
slowly.

She was sitting bent over some sewing that lay
spread out on her lap. He stood for a second or
two at the green gate that led up to the porch, and
then he laid his hand on the latch. At the click
of the latch Patty raised her head, and Tom saw
that she, like others that he had met, did not know
him.

She arose and stood watching him as he came
slowly up the path; his heart beating as though it
would smother him.

He reached the porch;—one step,—two steps,—three
steps,—and he stood upon it and looked at
her.[187]

Then he saw a strange frightened look come
slowly into her eyes; she reached out her hand and
laid it on the top of the rocking chair near to her.

“Patty!”

There was a space of dead silence, through which
Tom heard and noticed the sound of rushing water
and the clattering of the mill. He did not go a step
forward, for, as he looked at her, there was that in
her face that chilled him through and through—it
was as though a gulf had opened between them.

Her face was as white as death, and Tom saw the
fingers of the hand that rested on the top of the
rocking chair, quivering nervously. She moistened
her lips with her tongue, and at last she spoke, but
in a hoarse whisper, and so low that he could
hardly hear the matter of the words:

“Tom—Tom—Oh, my God, Tom! is that thee?”

“Yes, Patty; it’s me! I’ve come back to thee
after a sorely long time! Why don’t thee speak—why
don’t thee say something to me? What’s the
matter, Patty?”

“Wait—wait—let me think!” said she, putting
her finger to her forehead, “they all told me that
thee was dead—they said that thee was drowned.
Can dead people come back again?”

“Patty! Patty!” cried Tom, “my own darling!
tell me; what does this mean?”

By this time the tears were running in streams
down her pale cheeks; she made no effort to wipe
them away, and did not seem to know that they
were flowing.[188]

“What is the matter?—Patty, tell me,” said Tom,
again.

“Oh, Tom! I—I—am going to be married
to-morrow!”

I do not know how long it was that Tom stood
there, staring blankly at her. His throat was dry
and husky, and he felt the muscles of his face
twitching every now and then. It was Patty who
broke the silence.

“Tom!” she cried, in a choking voice; “dear Tom!
don’t look at me in that way—thee breaks my heart!
Say something kind to me, Tom—speak to me!”

“Who’s thee going to—who’s the man, Patty?”
said Tom, dully.

“Isaac Naylor. Oh, Tom! I was urged to it so
that I couldn’t help myself. They all told me that
thee was dead. Even thy mother said thee was
drowned!”

The muscles of Tom’s throat had tightened until
he felt as though he was choking. He stood as
though uncertain what to do, for a little while; then
he said, “I—I guess I’d better go—go home, now;
there’s no use my staying any—any longer.” Then
he turned away and went stumbling blindly down
the porch steps. He reached the gate and fumbled
for a little while, hunting for the latch; then he
opened it and went out into the road. There were
a few chickens dusting themselves in the path; he
stood looking stupidly at them for a little while, his
hands hanging limp at his sides. Then he turned
and walked heavily away, without looking back.



[189]




CHAPTER XV.


TOM GRANGER walked along, scarcely knowing
where he was going. After a while he
stopped and looked about him, and he saw that he
was standing in the road not far from the highway.
Around him was the silent woods; in front of him
was the sunny highroad, about three hundred paces
farther on. He felt that he could not go out into it
just now. He flung himself down on the grassy
roadside, burying his face in his arms, giving himself
up utterly to the despair that was upon him.
No sound broke the silence of the autumn woodland
but the gurgle of the rocky brook across the
road, the sudden rustle of the trees as the breeze
rushed through them now and then, and the rattling
of the dead leaves stirred by a breath of air.

Tom lay heeding nothing, thinking nothing, for
his heart was too full of the bitterness of his troubles
to give place to aught else. How long he lay
there he cannot tell; that which aroused him was
the sound of footsteps coming down the road from
the highway. Then he sprang to his feet, for he
could not bear that any one should find him lying
there. He saw that it was Isaac Naylor who was[190]
coming. Then Tom strode out into the road and
stood directly in front of him, so that the other
could not pass him.

“Does thee know who I am, Isaac Naylor?”
said he; then, without waiting for an answer, “I’m
Tom Granger!”

Maybe the Friend’s face grew a trifle whiter than
it was used to be; nevertheless, he stood his ground,
though he looked around and behind him, as
though to see whether any help was near to him in
case that the need for it should arise. I have no
doubt but that Tom’s face was white, his eyes
bloodshot, and that he looked wicked and dangerous
as he stood in the pathway in front of the
other. For a while Isaac stood with bent head and
with hands that trembled a little clasped in front of
him. But presently he raised his face and looked
calmly into Tom’s eyes.

“I heard in town that thee had come back,
Thomas,” said he, “and I was both glad and sorry
to hear it. I was glad that the Good Father had
spared thy life and sorry that thee had come back
just now. I see where thee’s been and I know
what thee’s heard. I’m sorry—very sorry.”

Tom steadied himself for a moment before he
spoke. When he replied, it was in a heavy, monotonous
voice: “Yes; I’ve been to see Patty and
she’s told me all. I do believe it’ll break her
heart. Poor girl! poor girl!” Then he stopped
for a moment. Hitherto he had spoken in a low,
dull voice; but as he thought of Patty’s grief, his[191]
self-restraint gave way and he burst out passionately,
“She’s mine, Isaac Naylor—she’s mine! She
loves me and no other man in all the world! By
the eternal, neither thee nor any other man shall
take her from me! I’ll let no man take her from
me; I don’t care who he may be!”

He waved his hands about furiously as he spoke,
clapping his palms together and pouring the words
out upon one another in a torrent. Isaac Naylor
must have had some fear that Tom would do him a
harm in his passion, for he stepped a pace back.
“Come, come, Thomas!” said he, soothingly;
“don’t be violent; I’ve done thee no harm—at least,
I’ve done thee no witting harm. Every one said
that thee was dead; even thy own people said so.
Go thy ways, Thomas, and let me go mine in peace.
Come; let me past!”

“No, by G-d! Thee’ll not go a step from this
till I let thee. Thee shan’t see Patty this day!
She’s mine and no other man shall have her for his
wife! Will thee give her up to me, Isaac Naylor?
Will thee give her up? Will thee give her up, I
say?”

Every time he repeated this he came a step
forward and Isaac moved a step back. Tom was
more than half crazy with his fury and the Friend
seemed very anxious and looked back at the road.

“Thomas! Thomas!” said he, “don’t be violent;
be reasonable; how could I make thee any such
promise as that? Let me past, I must see Patty;
there’s reason why I must see her now.”[192]

“Will thee give my darling back to me again?”

“I tell thee, Thomas, it can’t be done. I cannot
do it!”

“Thee won’t do it?” Tom stepped forward as
he spoke, waving his fist threateningly, and again
Isaac stepped backward before him, until he stood
against the fence at the roadside, and could go no
farther; his face was very white now, and he was in
deadly terror. “Let me go, Thomas,” said he, in a
trembling voice; “let me go—I’ll not go to Patty;
I’ll go back home again.” As he spoke he made a
movement to turn, as though to escape.

Tom’s head was in a mad whirl; there was a
ringing in his ears, and bright sparks danced and
swam before his eyes. “By the eternal! thee’ll
never leave this place, Isaac Naylor,” cried he, in a
terrible voice.

Then Isaac gave a shrill cry—“Help! Help!”
As the words left his lips, Tom leaped upon him,
and grappled with him. He struggled furiously,
and Tom heard him give another sharp and terrible
cry. Tom twisted his fingers into the Friend’s
neckerchief, and, after that he made no other noise
but a half-choked, strangling gurgle. Tom dragged
him backward, and flung him down upon his knees.
There was a rough-knotted stake lying by him; it
was a part of a fence rail. He picked it up and
raised it to strike.

I thank the Lord that his reason came back to
him when it did. Another moment, and he would
have been beating the life out of the poor terrified[193]
wretch at his knee. But suddenly, as though a
cloud passed from before his eyes, he saw the white
horror-struck face, the parted lips, and the staring
eyes that were glaring up at him. Then he gave
a cry so sharp that it rang in his own ears, and
flinging down the stake, loosened his hold on Isaac.

He stood for a moment staring at the Friend,
who staggered to his feet, and then sank down on a
great rock that lay near to them, swaying this way
and that, as though he were about to faint. Then
Tom turned and ran.

The next minute he was out in the highroad.

Beside the bridge was a shallow pool, through
which folks drove their teams in the summer time,
and where they often stopped to water their horses.
There was a black horse standing in the shallow
now, and a man was sitting upon its back. Tom
looked up as he ran out into the road, and saw that
it was Mr. Moor.

Mr. Moor’s eyes were fixed upon his own with a
very singular look, and it struck Tom how white
his face was. But all this he saw only in one quick
glance, for he turned the corner of the road, and
ran toward home without stopping. There was a
long and steep hill in front of him, and before he
reached the top he fell into a walk, for he was
panting and laboring for breath. After a while he
reached the crest of the hill, and before him lay a
level stretch of road; some distance along it he
could see the tall cedars that stood around the old
homestead farm-house. At last he came to where[194]
the long lane ran winding down from the house
amongst the maple and ailanthus trees, and opened
on the turnpike road through a gate that always
stood open. Then Tom broke into a run again; up
the lane he went, and so came at last to the paved
porch at the back of the house, noticing as he
passed, that Will Gaines’ horse and gig were
standing beside the horse block across the road.
Then he burst into the house, and into the best
room.

All of the shutters were bowed but one, which
was half opened, giving a faint light into the darkened
room. Tom’s father and mother, his sister
Susan, and his two elder brothers and Will Gaines
were all there. His mother was sitting in a rocking
chair, the tears running down her pale face, and
Susan was fanning her with a palm-leaf fan. Will
Gaines had told them of his coming, and Tom
afterward found that his mother had fainted, and
had only just recovered from her swoon.

“Mother!” cried he, and he ran to her and flung
himself on his knees in front of her, burying his
face in her lap, while great sobs shook him through
and through.

No one spoke for a long time, but Tom felt his
mother’s soft touch smoothing his hair. I think
that they were all weeping at that time. I know
that Susan was crying on the corner of the sofa,
where she had flung herself, burying her face in the
cushion. It was Will Gaines who spoke first.

“I guess I’ll go now,” said he, in a broken voice;[195]
and Tom presently heard him shutting the door
softly behind him.

Then another space of dead silence followed,
broken only by Susan’s catching breath. At last
Tom’s mother spoke.

“Where has thee been, Thomas?” said she.

“I’ve been to see Patty, mother.”

“Oh, Tom! Tom!” cried Susan; and Tom could
feel his mother’s hand trembling as it rested upon his
head. Presently she spoke in an unsteady voice:

“Leave us for a little while, father; it’ll be best—just
for a little while.”

Then the others went out, and they were left
alone. Tom told all about his meeting with Patty,
in broken and disconnected words. Every now
and then he would stop, for there were times when
the words that he sought to say would not come.
He felt that his mother was crying, though she was
crying silently. It was good for him to tell all of
his troubles, for there are times when our sorrows
gather upon us like great waters, that will overwhelm
the soul if they do not find an outlet in
speech.

Tom’s mother knew of the comfort that words
bring with them, so she let him talk on, without
saying anything herself. When he had ended, she
spoke gentle and loving words to him, though she
could give him no hope.

“I wish that I’d not seen Patty,” said Tom;
“I wish that I’d come straight home as Will told
me to do. Why didn’t he tell me of all this?”[196]

“I suppose that he couldn’t bring himself to
do it.”

“I wish I’d not seen her,” said Tom, again.

“It’s too late for wishing now,” said his mother.

Nothing more was said between them, and both
knew that the marriage must be gone through with
now. The time had been fixed for the wedding.
It was for eleven o’clock the next morning. The
friends had all been asked, the new house was
furnished, the linen provided, and even Patty’s
dresses made. It could not be stopped without
great scandal to all concerned. If only he had not
come back again. Then Patty would have been
married quietly to a man whom she could respect,
if not love, and her life would not have been without
contentment. But now that she had seen him,
what contentment could she have, loving him and
marrying another man?

At last they quitted the room together; but the
first bitterness had passed and gone. The first one
whom he met was Susan. She flung her arms
around his neck and kissed him, the tears brimming
in her eyes as she did so.

“Dear, dear Tom,” said she, and Tom knew from
the tone of her voice that she was thinking of Patty,
though her name had not been spoken betwixt
them.

“Don’t, Susan,” said he, huskily, for his heart
was still very sore.

Then his father came and shook hands with him,
as did William also, and presently John came over[197]
from the barnyard and joined them. This was all
of the family that were at home, for Henry was in a
store in Lancaster and Mary was visiting friends in
Chester.

Friends, of the old times especially, were a
restrained, self-repressed people, giving but little
freedom to the flow of natural feeling. Tom’s
father and his brothers had been moved—deeply
moved; but now, when they came forward to shake
him by the hand, excepting for the closeness of the
grip that they gave him and the firmness of the
pressure of palm to palm, no one would have
thought that he had returned to them as the dead
might return from the grave. It was, so far as any
outward forms were concerned, as though he had
but just come home after a two weeks’ absence.

After a few hesitating words of welcome, the
men folks sat down and Tom began telling of
those things that had befallen him in the year and
a half past. He spun his yarn pretty steadily,
though every now and then he would stop in his
speech, for as he told of the finding of the money
on the island, his words brought before him all of
those hopes that had borne him up through the
toil; then a rush of feeling would sweep over him
as he thought how all this had been taken out of
his life, and he would stop in his talking to steady
himself. He said nothing of this to the others, but
I think that they all felt the sorrow that was lying
at the bottom of his heart. Then they sat down to
supper.[198]

Tom’s father tried to turn the talk more cheerfully.

“We haven’t told thee the great news, Thomas,”
said he.

“What is it?” said Tom.

“Thee sees, thy coming upset us all, so that we
didn’t think of it. Thee tell him, Susan.”

Susan looked down, and the color rose in her
face.

“What is the news?” said Tom, again.

“Well,” said his father, “as Susan don’t seem
inclined to tell thee, I suppose I must do it myself.
How would thee like Will Gaines for a brother?”

Tom did not speak for a moment, then he said, a
little unsteadily; “I—I wish thee joy, Susan; thee’s
chosen a good man for thy husband, and I believe
he’ll make thee happy.”

Then they were silent for a while.

“When is thee going to be married?” said Tom
again, at last.

“The time’s not fixed yet; some time in the
eleventh month, I guess.”

After a while Tom’s father spoke.

“What’s thee going to do now, Thomas?” said he.

“I don’t know exactly,” said Tom, huskily; “I’m
going to Philadelphia again on the first stage
to-morrow.”

His mother looked earnestly at him, and the tears
rose in her eyes, and rolled slowly down her cheeks;
then she pushed back her chair, and left the table
hurriedly.[199]

Presently they all arose and went into the sitting-room.
There was a fire burning in the fireplace, for,
though the days were warm, the evenings were cool
and frosty. The four men sat down around the fire,
smoking and talking together in a rambling fashion.
Their words were constrained, for each felt upon his
mind the parting that was to come to-morrow.

So the time passed until the old clock in the
corner struck nine. Then Tom’s father arose in the
way that Tom knew so well, and lit his candle with
one of the paper lamplighters on the mantle shelf.
Before he left the room he came to Tom and laid
his hand on his shoulder.

“Thy burthen’s heavy, Thomas,” said he; “bear
it like a man.”

“I’ll try,” said Tom.

“I wish that we could have thee longer with us,
but thee’s doing right to go; thee mustn’t stay in
the neighborhood just now.” He stood for a
moment as though he were about to say something
more; he did not speak again, however, but presently
turned and left the room.

Such was Tom’s home-coming after a year and a
half of shipwreck and misery. How had he looked
forward to that home-coming, and how had it, like
dead sea fruit, turned to bitterness in the mouth!
Truly, it is kind in the good Father that he has
given us to look into the past, and not forward into
that which is to come. What hope would there be
left in the world, if we could know the sorrows that
were to come upon us in time?



[200]




CHAPTER XVI.


IT oftentimes comes in this world that cares and
troubles fall upon one, not in one deadly blow,
but in stroke after stroke, as though to bear the
man to the earth with their constant beating.
Surely men’s souls are of tough fibre that they can
so bend beneath such blows, beaten down only to
rise again, bruised, wounded, but living. There is
within a man a courage bred of hope that lives
even in the darkest moments; a courage that lifts
him up again out of the dust and supports him
along his way, lame and sore, perhaps, but not
broken down utterly.

So it was with Tom. Bitter troubles had come
upon him during the past year and a half, and the
bitterest and darkest of all had fallen upon him the
day before. Still more were to come, and yet he
has lived through these and others until his life has
covered a span of nigh four score and ten, and at
the end of them all he can still say that life is a
pleasant thing.

Tom was up at the peep of day, for there were
some things that he wished to take with him, and
the packing of them must be done before breakfast[201]
time. He was to leave on the Enterprise stage,
which passed the house about eight o’clock.

Little was said amongst the members of the
family during breakfast time, and only a few words
were spoken about his going. Half-past seven
came and then Tom stood up and kissed his
mother and Susan. Susan clung to him weeping;
his mother’s eyes were full of tears, but they did not
flow over.

“The Lord bless thee, my son!” said she, with
trembling lips. These were all the words that she
spoke.

“Come, Thomas,” said his father at last; “the
stage’ll soon be along, and thee’ll miss it if thee don’t
look out. I’ll walk down to the road with thee.”

“Farewell, William,” said Tom, shaking hands
with his brother.

“Farewell, Thomas.”

“John—”

“I guess I’ll walk down to the road with thee,
Thomas. Let me carry thy bundle,” said John.

“Never mind; it’s very light,” said Tom.

They were silent as they went down the lane,
and silent for a while as they stood at the roadside
waiting for the stage; each was occupied with his
own thoughts. At last John broke through the
painful silence. “The stage is mighty late this
morning,” said he, in a constrained voice.

“Thee’ll write to us, won’t thee, Thomas?” said
his father, looking away as he spoke.

“Yes,” said Tom.[202]

“Yonder’s the stage coming down Wilkes’ Hill,”
said John.

But it was destined that Tom was not to go to
Philadelphia that day on the Enterprise stage, or for
some time to come.

“Who’s that coming up the road yonder,” said
John.

“It looks like William Gaines,” said Tom’s father.

“It is Will Gaines,” said Tom.

So Will came galloping up to them, and then all
three men saw from his face that he was the bearer
of strange news. He leaped from his horse without
a word of greeting, or without seeming to wonder
why the three were standing there. His mind was
too preoccupied to give attention to anything but
his thoughts.

“Have you heard what’s happened?” said he.

“No.”

“What?”

Will hesitated for a moment and then said, in a
solemn voice: “Isaac Naylor has been murdered!”

There was a space of dead silence.

“Isaac Naylor murdered!” said Tom’s father
under his breath. Will nodded his head; he was
looking straight at Tom; his face was very pale and
there was a troubled, anxious look in his eyes.

“Murdered!” repeated John, mechanically, “where,
when, how?”

“Ephraim Whiteley and his colored man found
him at five o’clock this morning; his scull was
beaten in with a piece of fence-rail!”[203]

“My God!” cried Tom. He put his hand to his
forehead, for horrible thoughts were passing through
his mind. Could he—could he have killed Isaac?
Was it a creation of his fancy that had left him
sitting upon the rock, half strangled, but otherwise
unhurt?

“Where did they find him?” said John, in a low
voice.

“On the old mill road, about three hundred yards
from the turnpike.”

Tom looked slowly about him; was he dreaming?
Did he really hear the words that Will
spoke?

The Philadelphia coach had come up to them,
but no one had noticed its coming. They must
have showed by their faces that something strange
had happened, for the coach stopped when it came
to where they were standing.

“What’s the matter?” cried old John Grundy,
from the box.

“Isaac Naylor’s been murdered,” said John, in a
low voice.

“My Lord! Isaac Naylor murdered!” Then, after
a moment’s pause—“Where?—How?—When?” A
half a dozen heads were thrust out of the coach
windows by this time—they all listened in silence
while John repeated that which Will had just told
them. The coach went on down the road, but it
did not take Tom with it.

Then Will turned to Tom—“Tom, I want to
speak to you for a minute,” said he.[204]

Tom stepped aside with him, without answering.

Will was holding his horse by the reins; he did
not speak for a moment or two, but stood as though
thinking what to say.

“Tom, have you seen Isaac Naylor since you’ve
come back?” said he, at last.

“Yes.”

“Where?”

Tom hesitated before he spoke.

“Where?” said Will, again.

“At—at the place where they found him this
morning,” said Tom. He looked straight at Will
as he spoke, but Will turned his eyes away.

“Tom,” said he, “there’s a warrant out for your
arrest.”

“Mine!”

“Yes; yours, Tom. I expect the constable’s on
his way from Eastcaster now. Anyway, there’s no
time to lose. Here’s a horse ready for you; jump
on her and leave the country!”

“Will.”

“Well; what is it?”

“Do you believe that I killed Isaac Naylor?”

Will did not answer, but stood looking fixedly
on the ground.

“Never mind; I don’t ask you to answer me,
Will. I’ll tell you, however, that I did not do it.
I’ll stay and face the music.”

Then Tom turned and called his father and John.
“Father—John—did you hear what Will said?”

“No.”[205]

“He said that there’s a warrant out against me
for this thing.”

“A warrant out against thee?”

“Yes.”

“But thee hasn’t seen Isaac Naylor since thee
came home, Thomas,” said his father.

“Yes, I did, father.”

“Where?”

“At the very place where he was murdered.”

Then he told all that had passed between him
and Isaac Naylor, and of how near he had come to
doing that of which he was accused. His father
listened without a word, looking deeply and fixedly
into Tom’s eyes the while. John was looking
intently at him, too. Will was standing, turned half
away. When Tom had ended, his father spoke to
him in a low voice:

“Thomas.”

“Well?”

“Is—is that all? Has thee told us all?”

“Yes, father.”

“Why didn’t thee speak of it before?”

“I couldn’t bear to do it. I was afraid to tell
how I had treated him—an overseer in the meeting.”

Tom’s heart crumbled within him at the silence
that followed his words.

“Father,” he said, “so help me God, my hands
are clean of this thing. Does thee suppose I’d
have come home if I’d done it?”

“Wait a minute, Thomas; I’m thinking,” said
his father. He stood picking at his finger-tips, and[206]
looking earnestly at them. At last he raised his
head. “I don’t believe that thee did do it, Thomas.
I can’t believe it.”

“Neither can I!” burst out John. “My brother
couldn’t do a thing like that. My mother’s son
couldn’t kill a man. I don’t believe it, and I can’t
believe it!”

The tears sprang into Tom’s eyes at these words.
He looked at Will, but Will’s head was still turned
away. “Here comes the constable,” said he, at
last, in a low voice.

A horse and gig had come up from behind
Stony-Brook Hill. When it reached the level road
between them and the crest of the rise the nag
broke into a trot.

“Yes, that’s Johnson’s team,” said John, and
then he turned his head away.

They all stood silently until at last the gig came
up to where they were. The constable and his
deputy were both in it. The constable drew up the
horse, and threw the reins to the deputy. Then he
stepped out and came over to where the others
were standing, drawing a paper out of his breast-pocket
as he did so. He had not said a word up
to this time.

“I know what you’re coming for,” said Tom;
“I’m ready to go with you, Johnson.”

“The Lord knows—I’d rather lose a hundred
dollars, than have to do this,” said the constable.

“I believe you would,” said Tom.

“Can thee wait a little while, Eben?” said Tom’s[207]
father; “I’d like to drive over to Squire Morrow’s
along with you. I’ll slip up to the house and gear
Nelly to the wagon; it won’t take me a minute.”

The constable drew a watch out of his fob, and
looked at it. “I guess I can wait a little bit, Mr.
Granger,” said he; “the witnesses weren’t all at the
squire’s when I left. You’ll have to step into the
gig though, Tom, and I’ll—I’ll have to put cuffs on
you.”

“Will you have to do that?”

“I’m afraid I will;”—he drew the hand-cuffs out
of his pocket as he spoke; there was a sharp
“click! click!” and Tom felt the cold iron circling
his wrists.

His father groaned, and when Tom looked at
him, he saw that his face was as white as wax. He
turned, and he and John walked slowly up the lane
toward the house.

Then Tom stepped to the gig, and climbed in
beside the deputy constable. Johnson went to the
roadside, and sat down on the bank. He sat with
his elbows resting on his knees, and his hands
hanging clasped together between them. Will
stood leaning against the pailing fence, and nothing
was said, excepting once when the constable spoke
to his deputy.

“Better turn the hoss, Jos; you won’t have to do
it then when Mr. Granger and John come back.”

After a while they saw John drive the farm-wagon
over from the stable to the house. William was
sitting beside him and presently Tom’s father came[208]
out of the house and climbed slowly into it. Then
they drove down the road to where the others were
waiting.

“Father, how did mother take the news?” said
Tom.

“Very well! Very well! Better than I expected,”
said his father, briefly; then he turned to
Will: “Thee’d better go up to the house, William;
I’d like thee to stay with mother and Susan while
we’re gone.”

Will mounted his horse without a word, and,
turning into the lane, galloped up to the house
beneath the shadows of the trees.

“Are you all ready?” said the constable, standing
with one foot on the step of the gig.

“All ready.”

Then he climbed in and they all drove away
toward Eastcaster.



[209]




CHAPTER XVII.


AS the gig rattled down the hill and past the end
of Penrose’s road, Tom leaned forward and
looked up toward the spot where he had met Isaac
Naylor the day before. A knot of people had
gathered about the place where the body had been
found, collected there by the morbid curiosity that
stirs men at such a time; they were talking earnestly
together, some sitting on the fence, some leaning
against it.

At last they reached the level road that led into
Eastcaster, and the nag broke into a trot. The
houses were clustered more thickly together around
the outskirts of the town. Of course, the news had
spread everywhere, and knots of people were gathered
here and there talking the matter over. As
the gig with the three men in it rattled along the
stony street, the talk would be hushed in these
groups, and the people would turn and gaze at the
constables and their prisoner. Tom had not realized
all that he would have to pass through till
now; he had not known what it would be to have
his neighbors and old acquaintances staring at him
with that look of mixed curiosity and horror. He[210]
shrunk together in the gig back of the constables,
striving to hide himself behind them. Johnson
must have known how he felt, for he laid the whip
to the horse and drove on as fast as possible.

At last they reached Squire Morrow’s office, at
the corner of Market and Andover streets. It was
a small, dark two-storied building, with an old-fashioned
hipped roof;—it has since been torn down
to make way for Prettyman’s new store. A great
crowd had gathered around the corner about the
squire’s office, and they could see through the
windows that the room was packed with the people
inside. The gig drew up to the sidewalk and the
constable stepped down out of it.

“You’ll have to get down, now, Tom,” whispered
Jos Giddings, the deputy, in Tom’s ear. Then Tom
stepped out and the deputy followed him. The
constable had a great deal of trouble in pushing his
way through the people, for they crowded up very
closely to get a look at Tom. He walked with his
eyes fixed straight ahead of him; he saw nothing
but the crown of the constable’s hat, but he knew,
as well as though he had looked about him, that a
mass of faces were gazing at him with eager and
intense curiosity. He also knew that his father and
his brothers, John and William, had gotten out of
the farm wagon and were following close behind
him.

“Stand out of the way there!” said the constable,
in a loud voice, as he pushed into the office, and then
Tom found himself standing beside a railing that[211]
separated the squire’s desk from the mass of people
packed into the body of the office. The light came
through a little window in the end of the room, so
that Tom could see things only duskily after coming
in from the dazzling glare of the sunlight outside.
Mr. Morrow was sitting at his desk, leaning back in
his chair, with a very troubled look in his eyes. He
was playing absently with a pen that lay on the
table in front of him.

“Won’t the prisoner sit down, constable?” said
he; “he looks pretty badly.”

“I don’t care to sit down,” said Tom, “I’d rather
stand.” He was resting with his handcuffed hands
on the railing in front of him; after a while he
collected his courage, and then he looked slowly
around him.

A number of people were sitting inside of the
railing; the first one that he saw was Patty Penrose,
and on her his eyes lingered long and painfully.
She was very white, and dark rings encircled her
eyes. She sat with her handkerchief in her hand,
and she wiped the slow tears from her cheeks with
it every now and then. Her father sat beside her,
looking very hard and stern. He did not glance at
Tom until later in the examination that followed.
Just behind Elihu Penrose sat Mr. Moor. He, too,
was very pale, and every now and then he wiped
his face with a bandana handkerchief. Beside these
three were Ephraim Whiteley and his colored man,
Mrs. Bond, the landlady of the Crown and Angel,
and Dr. Winterapple.[212]

Then Tom looked up and saw that his father and
his two brothers stood beside him.

The first witness called was Ephraim Whiteley.
He was tall, ungainly, round shouldered and loose
jointed. He was an elderly man; a very plain
Friend, and, like Isaac Naylor, was one of the overseers
of the meeting.

Of course, he affirmed, for Friends are not
allowed, by the Society, to take oath as to the
truth of evidence. He testified that he and his
colored man “Jim” were going to Downeyville
with a load of potatoes. They had started early
in the morning—about five o’clock, he should
think. Had found deceased lying in front of the
“big stone” beside the roadside, about two or three
hundred yards from the turnpike. Had thought
that it was some one who had been drinking—remembers
that Jim said something to that effect.
Had not thought differently from this, until he
had come close to where deceased was lying. He
noticed then a dark stain on the collar, and also
deceased’s plain coat—he knew that something was
wrong. He stopped the wagon, and he and Jim
went over to where the body was lying. Found a
heavy knotted piece of wood lying close to the
deceased, and noticed that there was blood upon
it. He had turned deceased over; did not know
who it was until he heard Jim say, “Good Lord!
it’s Mr. Naylor!” He and Jim lifted the body
into the wagon, and drove over to Elijah Hunt’s,
thinking it best to take it to deceased’s cousin.[213]
Had summoned the coroner at Elijah Hunt’s request.

The next witness called was James Madison
Trusty (colored).

He was in Mr. Whiteley’s employ. He had gone
with Mr. Whiteley to take a load of potatoes to
Downeyville. He had called Mr. Whiteley’s attention
to the body of the deceased. It was lying on
it’s face in the grass, close to the “big stone.” He
had thought at first that it was some one drunk. He
had said to Mr. Whiteley that “there was a happy
man,” or, “that man ought to be happy,” or some
such speech—could not remember the exact words.
He did not think much about it till Mr. Whiteley
stopped the cart and jumped out. Mr. Whiteley
had turned the body over, and he had recognized
the face as that of Mr. Naylor—called Mr. Whiteley’s
attention to the same. Mr. Whiteley called on
him to lift deceased into the cart. He was very
sick, and it was some time before he could bring
himself to touch the body.

(Doctor) Justin S. Winterapple was the next
witness called.

He had made the post-mortem examination before
the coroner’s jury. There was the mark of only
one contusion—it was at the base of the cranium,
immediately behind and under the right ear. The
bone was fractured as though with some heavy
weapon. It might have been done with the club or
knotted piece of wood found lying beside the
deceased—thought altogether likely that it was[214]
done by it. He did not think that the deceased
died immediately upon receiving the blow.

All this was terrible to Tom; so terrible that he
grasped the railing in front of him, until his finger
nails were livid with the force of the grip. But
what must it have been to Patty? Tom looked at
her, and the expression of her face made him forget
his own troubles. “Oh, God!” muttered he to
himself, “that I should have come home to bring
all this upon her!”

The next witness called was Mrs. Bond.

She testified that the prisoner had come by the
Union line, in stage No. 3, the day before. He and
Mr. Gaines had met, and had gone into the parlor;
they had talked there a long time, and at last the
prisoner had come out, and had gone up Market
street in the direction of his home. She had not
known the prisoner until Mr. Gaines had told her.
She remembered to have remarked how changed
he was, and that she would never have known him
with his long beard and his grey hair.

Mr. Morrow looked vexed. “Why hasn’t Mr.
Gaines been called?” said he; “how is it he hasn’t
been called? Where is he now?”

“He’s out at Mr. Milton Granger’s,” said the
constable.

The magistrate “pished” and “pshawed,” but at
last he said that they might as well go on with the
examination of the other witnesses, and that they
could send for Mr. Gaines if his evidence should be
found to be necessary.[215]

The next witness called was Edmund R. Moor.
The Bible was passed to him to swear upon, but he
pushed it hurriedly away from him and said that he
would affirm, and not swear to the truth of his
statement. Mr. Morrow seemed somewhat surprised,
but he said nothing, and took Mr. Moor’s
affirmation as he desired. He then testified that he
had been with Isaac Naylor the afternoon before, at
about four o’clock. The deceased had come to
consult him upon a matter of business concerning
some money that he, the witness, had invested for
the other. He had left him, saying that he was
going down to White’s store for his letters. He
had seen deceased about half an hour later, walking
up Market Street. He, the witness, had been feeling
ill all day, and had quitted his office to step
around to the stable for his horse, thinking a ride
might be of benefit to him. He had seen deceased
turn into Penrose’s road, and remembered to have
heard him say, a little while before, that he was
going to see Elihu Penrose’s daughter, whom he
was engaged to marry.

Tom looked at Patty as Mr. Moor said these
words, and saw her hide her face with her trembling
hands. He groaned when he saw the agony that it
caused her.

The witness then went on to say that he had
thought no more of it, but was watering his horse
at the shallow, when he saw the prisoner run out of
the road and turn up the turnpike, in the direction
of Granger’s farmhouse.[216]

The magistrate asked Mr. Moor several questions,
in answer to which he said that he had not
known the prisoner, because of the beard and the
whiteness of his hair; he did not think of its being
Mr. Thomas Granger. He also said that he had
gone on up the turnpike after he had watered his
horse; that he had not thought of anything having
happened to Isaac Naylor, and that he did not hear
any cry or call for help, to make him think that
anything had gone wrong.

Mr. Moor was so white that the magistrate asked
him if he was ill.

“I do feel sick,” said he. “I haven’t felt well
since yesterday morning. Maybe it’s the closeness
of the room that makes me feel sick now.”

He wiped his face with his bandana handkerchief
as he spoke, for it was wet with the sweat that ran
trickling down his cheeks.

“I’m sorry you feel so sick, Mr. Moor,” said the
magistrate.

“If you have no more use for me, I’d like to go,”
said Mr. Moor.

Mr. Morrow said that he might leave now, if he
wished, so he worked his way through the crowd
in the office, looking neither to the right nor to the
left, and so went into the street.

The next witness called was Patty Penrose, and
she stood up, resting her hand on the top of her
chair as she did so. There was not a particle of
color in her face as she stood before the magistrate.
A strand of hair had fallen across her brow, but she[217]
did not brush it back, or seem to notice it. Tom’s
heart bled for her as he stood looking at her.

“Will you swear or affirm?” said the magistrate.

“I affirm,” she answered, in a low voice. Then
she repeated after him the words of affirmation: “I
do most solemnly affirm—that what I tell—is the
truth—the whole truth—and nothing but the truth.”

“When did you see the prisoner last?”

“Yesterday.”

“At what time was it?”

“In the afternoon.”

“But what time was it—at what time in the
afternoon was it that you saw him?”

She did not answer immediately, and Tom, as he
looked at her, saw that she was swaying, as though
she was about to fall.

“Perhaps the witness had better sit down while
she gives her evidence,” said Mr. Morrow.

Patty did not seem to understand him, and her
father spoke to her in a low voice. Then she sat
down mechanically, as though she did not know
what she was doing.

“Take courage, Patty!” burst out Tom. “God
knows I am innocent of this! God knows I am!”

“The prisoner must be silent!” said the magistrate,
rapping on the desk before him with his
knuckles. Then, speaking to Patty again: “At
what hour in the afternoon was it that you saw him?”

Patty looked up and her eyes met Tom’s. He
tried to smile. “Speak out, Patty, and tell everything,”
said he.[218]

“About five o’clock,” said she, faintly.

“What was said between you?” said the magistrate.

There was a pause of dead silence, every one
listening to catch the answer. At last the magistrate,
after waiting a while for her to speak, repeated:

“Can you tell me what was said between you?”

There was another pause, and still Patty made no
answer. Suddenly she burst forth: “Oh, I can’t!—I
can’t!—I can’t!” She covered her face with her
hands as she spoke, rocking her body back and
forth, while convulsive sobs shook her through and
through.

I think that few eyes were dry in the magistrate’s
office. Tom stood looking at his darling with
trembling lips, the tears trickling unnoticed down
his cheeks. Old Elihu Penrose sat gazing stonily
ahead of him, his hands clasped tightly together
upon his lap.

Nothing was said for some time, and Mr. Morrow
sat wiping his spectacles. After a while he spoke
in a gentle and soothing manner: “You must
answer me—you must, indeed. It is sad, very sad.
I wouldn’t ask you these things if I didn’t have to.
But you must answer me. Can’t you tell me what
was said between you when you saw him last?”

“I—I—I told-him—that I was to—to be married—to-day.”

There was a moment of hesitation before the
magistrate asked the next question. Then it came;[219]

“Was there a promise of marriage between you
and the prisoner before he left Eastcaster a year and
a half ago?”

Again there was no answer given to Mr. Morrow’s
question, and, after a little pause, the magistrate
repeated it.

Still Patty said nothing; her face sank lower,
lower, lower upon her breast and her hands slid
helplessly to her lap; then she swayed slowly from
one side to the other. Tom was looking intently at
her, and suddenly he gave a sharp and bitter cry:—

“Catch her; she’s falling! My God, you’ve
killed her!”

As he spoke she sank forward, and would have
fallen if her father had not caught her in his arms
and so saved her. Then he looked at Tom for the
first time since he had come into the magistrate’s
office.

“If she’s killed, it’s thy doings, Thomas Granger,”
said he, in a low, constrained voice. He stood
grimly holding her, but all around him was confusion
and tumult. Mr. Morrow pushed his chair
back hastily and arose and Dr. Winterapple ran to
her.

“Let her lie on the floor!” he cried, “she’s
fainted! Some water, quick!”

Her father laid her down upon the floor and Dr.
Winterapple, snatching up a pitcher of water that
sat upon the table, began sprinkling her face and
bathing her temples. Mrs. Bond kneeled beside
her, chafing and slapping her hands.[220]

Elihu Penrose sat down in his chair again, staring
at Patty with the same expressionless look that he
had worn all along. After a while her bosom rose
with a deep, convulsive sigh and she partially
unclosed her eyes, moving her head from side to
side. They lifted her up and sat her in a chair,
and Mrs. Bond fanned her. Then Tom turned to
the magistrate.

“Mr. Morrow,” said he, “for the love of heaven,
don’t torture her any more; I’ll tell everything!”

“Take care,” said Mr. Morrow, warningly; “I
tell you plainly that what you say will be taken in
evidence against you. Your case is dark enough—don’t
make it any blacker.”

“I don’t care how black the case is against me!
I’d rather have anything happen to me than have
you make that poor girl convict me out of her own
mouth! I’ve kept my lips shut too long already.”

“I have only to say, take care what you say!”
said the magistrate again.

“I’ll take care! You asked her if there was any
promise of marriage between us before I sailed
away on this last cruise. There was a promise of
marriage! I’ll tell you farther—”

“I’ll have to commit you from your own lips, if
there’s more such evidence to come.”

“I don’t care!” said Tom, in a ringing voice, “I’ll
tell you that I was half crazy after I left her, for I
didn’t know that she was going to be married till
she told me herself. I met Isaac Naylor at the
very place where he was killed, and I did use[221]
violence to him; but I neither struck him nor killed
him.”

“That’ll do,” said Mr. Morrow, “I’ll have to
commit you for trial. I’d have had to commit you,
anyhow, even if you hadn’t spoken a word, for
there was evidence enough for it. I’m sorry for
you; very sorry.”

He dipped his pen in the ink as he spoke, and
began writing.

Tom’s father laid his horny palm on Tom’s hand
as he stood clutching the railing in front of him.
“Thee’s done right to speak, even if it weighs
against thee, Thomas,” said he. The tears arose in
Tom’s eyes at his father’s words. All the time he
had been speaking, he was looking at Patty. She
was leaning back in her chair with her lips apart,
and her eyes just showing through the half-closed
lids. He saw that she had heard nothing of what
he had said, and he was glad of it.

The magistrate reached across the railing, and
handed the commitment to the constable.

“Farewell, father,” said Tom, “thee believes that
I’m innocent; don’t thee?”

“Yes; I do,” said his father, in a husky voice.
Then he gave way to his feelings, as no one
had ever seen him do before—he laid both hands
on his son’s shoulders, and kissed him on the
cheek.

“Farewell, John; farewell, William,” said he,
reaching out his hands to his brothers.

“Farewell, Thomas,” said John, clapping him[222]
upon the shoulder, and trying to speak cheerfully;
“thee’ll come out all right; I know thee will!”

“I hope so,” said Tom.

“You’ll have to come along, now,” said the
constable. Then they went out again through the
curious crowd, Johnson pushing a way through the
people for himself and his prisoner. They stepped
into the gig, and drove away to the gaol.



[223]




CHAPTER XVIII.


TOM GRANGER had been in Eastcaster gaol
about an hour, when Will Gaines came to
see him.

Since the click of the lock that shut him in his
cell as a murderer had sounded in his ears, a calmness
and a peace almost akin to happiness had
fallen upon his spirit. This may sound strange, but
there are periods, in times of trouble and grief,
when the soul is relaxed from its tension of pain,
and quietude comes for the time being. Tom’s
brain was as clear as crystal, and he reviewed his
position with a keenness that surprised himself He
saw that the evidence was strong against him—damningly
strong. As he walked up and down his
cell, thinking over all that the witnesses had said—and
he seemed to remember every word—he felt as
though he were shut in by a wall of evidence that
he could never hope to break through. But,
though realizing all this, he had none of that anxiety
regarding it, that it would have seemed natural for
him to feel; it was almost as though these things
concerned another person.

So he walked up and down his cell, going over[224]
all that had passed in the squire’s office. Of a
sudden, a flaw in a certain part of the evidence
struck him; it was but a small thing, but it was
sufficient to arouse a new thought within him.
Then he stood quite still in the middle of the cell,
looking down upon the floor, and sunk in meditation,
for his mind was busy in following up point
after point of this thought, as a hound follows up
the scent of game that it has freshly started.

How long he stood there I do not know, but he
was aroused at last by the opening of the door of
his cell, and Will Gaines came in to him. Will did
not say a word; neither did he look at Tom, but
he flung his hat and cloak despondingly upon the
table.

“Sit down, Will,” said Tom, “take that chair;
I’ll sit here on the edge of the cot.”

“Thank’ee,” said Will, “I will sit down, if you
don’t mind. I’m kind of tired and fagged out.”

“How did you leave mother and Susan?” said
Tom, after a moment or two of silence had passed.

“Oh, pretty well. Of course, your mother is
very troubled at what has occurred, but, on the
whole, she bears it better than I could have hoped
for. She believes that you’re innocent.”

“She’s right.”

Will heaved a sigh. “I hope she is,” said he.

“Thank’ee,” said Tom, a little grimly, and then
the talk lapsed between them again.

“Tom,” said Will, breaking the silence, “your
father has engaged me to act as your attorney in[225]
this matter. The Lord knows, I wish I had more
experience. I haven’t always worked as hard as I
might have done, and now, when it has fallen to my
lot to have to defend the brother of the girl that I
hope to marry from a charge of murder, it seems
likely that I’ll have to pay a bitter price for all the
time that I have wasted. However, I’ll go to Philadelphia
to-morrow and see Mr. Fargio, and get him
to take up your case. I’ve come to talk over the
matter with you, Tom.”

“Wait a minute, Will. I have a question to ask
you, first. Do you believe me guilty?”

Will Gaines looked fixedly out of the window of
the cell, but he did not answer. Tom smiled a
little sadly.

“I think I know how you feel about it, without
the asking, Will,” said he. “Now, do you think
that I’d have a man defend me who didn’t believe
that I was innocent?”

“Of course; you’d have to have some one to
defend you.”

“I don’t see that. If I really was guilty of this
thing, it seems to me that I ought to be punished
as the law calls for. However, that is neither here
nor there, for I hope to make you believe in my
innocence before you quit this cell.”

“I wish to Heaven you could,” said Will, but
his tone was rather gloomy than hopeful.

“Well, I’ll have a try at it. In the first place, I’ll
have to ask you whether you think that I’m the kind
of man that would murder another in cold blood?”[226]

“Of course I don’t believe that,” said Will.

“You don’t think that I’m capable of lying in
wait for Isaac Naylor, and deliberately killing him—not
in heat of passion, but with a cool hand?”

“Certainly not. You don’t think that I’d believe
such a thing of you as that, do you?”

“Then, if I had killed him, I would have been in
a rage, and hardly conscious of what I was doing?”

“Yes.”

“In that case, I think that I can easily convince
you that I didn’t do it at all.”

“I wish you could,” said Will, again.

“Do you believe what I told you up home, about
meeting Isaac Naylor, and fighting with him?”

Will nodded his head.

“If I’d killed him at all, I would have killed him
then, and in that struggle, wouldn’t I?”

“Yes.”

“Very good. Now, Dr. Winterapple affirmed
before the magistrate that only one blow had been
given, and that that blow was immediately behind
and under the right ear.”

Will was looking very earnestly at Tom. “I
heard his evidence before the coroner’s jury,” said
he.

“Well, I’m right, ain’t I?”

“Yes.”

“Where are your wits, man? How could I
strike him in the back part of the head, and under
the right ear, if I struck him while he was fighting
me off, as he must have been doing under the[227]
circumstances? Look here; suppose you and I
are facing one another, so—I have a club in my
hand to strike you with; I couldn’t possibly reach
you to strike you where Isaac received the blow
that finished him. If I were to strike you a blow
in a moment of fury, it would be on the top or on
the left side of the head. It would be impossible to
strike you on the right side, without I were left
handed.”

“Tom,” said Will, “I hadn’t thought of that—what
a fool I have been.”

“Well, I suppose you didn’t think of it,” said
Tom, “but I don’t see that that makes a fool of
you.”

“You’ve made a great point,” said Will; “I see
now; of course you couldn’t.”

“Wait a bit,” said Tom, “you’re going too fast,
now. Any one, except a friend, who wanted to
believe in my innocence, would say that Isaac might
have broken away from me, and have run. If I’d
struck him while he was running away, I’d have
given him just such a blow as killed him.”

“That’s true.”

“But, if he’d tried to run away from me, he’d
have run in the beaten track, and not in the grass
and briars along the roadside. Now, he was found
lying in the grass just as he had fallen, and surely,
it isn’t likely that if I had struck him down in the
middle of the road, I would afterward have dragged
him into the grass. My first instinct, after I had
done the deed, would be to run away, and leave[228]
him lying where he was. He was sitting on the
‘big stone’ when he was struck, and he fell forward
just where Ephraim Whiteley found him.”

So Tom ended and stood looking at Will. Will
said nothing at first, but at last he spoke.

“Tom,” said he, drawing a deep breath, “I am
more thankful to you than I can tell; you have
lifted a great load off my mind. I don’t think that
I ever fully believed that you were guilty of this
thing, but, I was afraid—I was afraid. The evidence
was strong against you—you did meet Isaac Naylor,
according to your own confession, and you kept
that meeting secret from every one. You had just
seen Patty, and had heard all, and I know that you
must have been half crazy with it. I believe in
your innocence now, but the circumstances were
very strong against you.”

“Yes; they were, Will,” said Tom; “you had
good reason to suspect me; nevertheless, I own
freely, I felt kind of cut up when I saw what you
thought. Even this that I’ve just said to you,
wouldn’t go for much, only that you are ready and
anxious to believe me. It wouldn’t weigh a
moment with a jury.”

“I’m not so sure of that.”

Tom made no answer to this last speech; he took
a turn or two up and down his cell, and then stopped
suddenly in front of the other.

“You believe I’m innocent now, do you?”

“Yes.”

“Firmly?”[229]

“Firmly.”

“And you won’t think that anything further that
I may say to you’ll be for the purpose of throwing
the blame off my own shoulders and upon those of
another man?”

“No.”

“Then I believe I know who it was that did kill
Isaac Naylor.”

“Who?” said Will, almost breathlessly.

Tom looked him in the eyes for a moment or two
before he spoke.

“Edmund Moor,” said he, quietly.

For a time Will glared at him with wide-opened
eyes and mouth. “Tom,” said he, at last, in a low
voice, “what makes you say such a thing as that?
What leads you to make so horrible an accusation
against such a man as Mr. Moor?”

“That horrible accusation was made against me.”

“But the circumstances were strong against you.”

“I think the circumstances are strong against
him.”

“I don’t see it.”

Tom sat down on the edge of the table facing the
other. “Look here, Will;” said he, “suppose that
a man bearing testimony against another accused of
murder should give evidence that was faulty in
nearly every point; wouldn’t your first thought be
that he knew more of the real story than he was
inclined to tell, and that he was willing to let the
accused suffer for it?”

“Yes.”[230]

“That’s what Mr. Moor did; you didn’t hear his
evidence before the magistrate, but I did, and what’s
more, I remember every word of it. This is what
he said: That he was riding out the turnpike for
pleasure, and that he saw Isaac Naylor turn into
Penrose’s road; that he stopped his horse to water
it at the shallow beside the bridge; that he saw me
run out of the mill road and up the turnpike, and
that he did not know who I was; that he heard no
sound of any kind to make him suspect that something
was going wrong; that he thought nothing
more about Isaac Naylor, but went along the turnpike
without looking up the road where Isaac had
gone. Now, Will, is there nothing that strikes you
as strange in all that?”

“Well, no; I can’t see anything strange in it. It
sounds straightforward enough to me.”

“It sounds straightforward enough, Will, but it
won’t bear looking into. When a man invents a
story, it may seem to be reasonable enough, but,
you may depend upon it, it’s not sound in all it’s
parts, and must give way somewheres. The first
thing that struck me as strange in this was a small
matter enough, but it set me to thinking. Mr.
Moor’s horse was standing in the shallow beside
the bridge when I ran out into the turnpike. Now,
in thinking the matter over, it occurred to me that,
if I was out riding for pleasure, and my horse was
fresh from the stable, I wouldn’t stop within three
quarters of a mile from home to water it; would
you?”[231]

Will was gazing fixedly into Tom’s eyes; he
made no answer to the question, but he shook his
head.

“That, as I say, was the first thing that struck
me; it was a little thing, but it set me athinking,
and I began to wonder why Mr. Moor should have
stopped his horse. The day wasn’t warm enough
to make it any pleasure to drive through a shallow;
one wouldn’t think of doing such a thing on a cool
autumn day. So I began turning things over and
over in my mind and, after a while, the whole story
went to pieces, like a card house when you take
away one of the cards. Now, I think I can prove
to you from Mr. Moor’s own evidence before the
magistrate, that he was within three hundred yards
of Isaac Naylor and me during the whole time that
we were together, and that he saw all that passed
between us. Mr. Moor said that he saw Isaac Naylor
turn into the mill road. To do that, he must
have been pretty well down the hill or he couldn’t
have seen him for the trees; he couldn’t have been
over five hundred yards away from him, could he?”

Will shook his head.

“Now, Isaac Naylor walked about two or three
hundred yards down the mill road before he met
me, and there’s where he was found the next
morning—killed. While he walked that three
hundred yards, Mr. Moor, on horseback, could
easily have covered the five hundred yards between
the spot from where he saw him to the place where
the mill road opens into the turnpike, so that he[232]
could have come up to the opening of the road just
about the time that Isaac Naylor met me. Now,”
said Tom, patting the edge of the table upon which
he was sitting to give force to that which he was
saying, “is it reasonable that I could have talked
to Isaac Naylor, have fought with him and have
killed him, and then have run the three hundred
yards to the turnpike while Mr. Moor sat on his horse
watering it at the shallow? Is it reasonable, say?”

“No,” said Will, “it’s not.” He seemed half
dazed with that which Tom was telling him, but
Tom saw that he was following him, and that was
all that he wanted.

“Now, here’s another point. According to this,
he was within three hundred yards of the scene of
the murder at the very time that the murder was
being done, and yet, by his evidence, he didn’t hear
a single sound. Now, Isaac Naylor called for help
while I was fighting with him—and called twice,
and yet Mr. Moor, though it is clear that he was
so near to us, heard nothing of it.”

Will rose from his chair and began walking
excitedly up and down the room. Tom watched
him for a while in silence. “Have I made my
meaning clear to you?” said he, at last.

“Clear? Yes—yes; of course you’ve made it
clear.”

“I’ve more to say yet,” said Tom, “and when
you’ll sit down and listen coolly, I’ll go on.”

Then Will sat down in his chair again without a
word.[233]

“Are you ready?”

“Yes.”

“Now, Mr. Moor said that when he had done
watering his horse, he rode on up the turnpike.
The horse wasn’t drinking when I saw it. I ran on
up the road, but I stopped before I got to the crest
of the hill, for my breath gave out. I walked the
rest of the way, which was about half a mile, to the
homestead. Now, I take it, a man on horseback
could have passed me, even if I’d run all the way.
But Mr. Moor didn’t pass me, and there was no
sign of him when I turned into the lane; so he did
not ride on up the pike as he said he did. Neither
did he turn back home, for no man would turn
back from a pleasure ride after he had gone only
three quarters of a mile. Will, how many roads
are there between Stonybrook bridge and father’s
house?”

“Only one.”

“And that is—”

“Penrose’s road.”

“Will,” said Tom, leaning forward, looking into
the other’s eyes and speaking very slowly, “when
I left Edmund Moor he rode up Penrose’s road.”

“Tom! Tom!” cried Will Gaines, springing to
his feet, “this is incredible!”

“Incredible! Doesn’t it sound reasonable?”

“Yes, yes; only too reasonable!” Then he began
walking up and down. Suddenly he stopped in
front of Tom. “Who would have thought,” said
he, “that such a quiet, dull-seeming fellow as you,[234]
Tom Granger, would have thought out all this for
yourself!”

“I don’t see anything wonderful in my thinking
the matter out, considering that my own life and the
happiness of all belonging to me are concerned in
my thinking. But, I haven’t done yet. According
to my certain knowledge, Mr. Moor did not ride up
the turnpike; therefore he must have turned up
Penrose’s road, for there was no other. Now, if I’d
killed Isaac Naylor, he’d found him lying there,
even if he’d heard no sound to make him suspect
anything. If he’d found Isaac Naylor alive and
left him alive, one word from him would have been
enough to have cleared me. He said no word,
therefore he wished the blame to rest upon me; he
wished the blame to rest upon me, therefore he had
something that he wished to hide. Without he was
concerned in the affair he would want to hide
nothing. If he was concerned in it, he was concerned
in it alone, for there was no one but him
near enough to hear Isaac call for help; if there
had been they would have come. Yesterday afternoon,
when I came to Eastcaster in the stage, I saw
Mr. Moor and Isaac Naylor looking out of Moor’s
office window; if nothing had happened since, I
don’t know that I would have thought anything of
it, but, in looking back now, I tell you that there
was something wrong between them; there was a
look about them—the way in which they were
standing, the expression of their faces, that makes
me feel that I am right in what I say. When I ran[235]
out into the road after leaving Isaac Naylor, Mr.
Moor’s face was as white as wax, now—” here
Tom paused abruptly and began walking restlessly
up and down the cell. After a while he stopped
and stood in the middle of the room. He looked
out of the window and not at Will when he spoke
again.

“Will,” said he, solemnly, “I don’t know what
has come over me; I don’t know whether it’s the
state of mind that I’m in or not, but I can see the
way that Isaac Naylor was killed—at least, I think I
can—as clearly as though I had second sight. God
forgive me if I’m wrong, but this is how I see it in
my mind’s eye. I don’t know why Mr. Moor was
riding along the turnpike just at that time, but I
believe that it was to see and speak to Isaac Naylor
again. However that may be, he was riding along
the pike, and came to the end of the mill road where
it opens upon the highway. There he saw Isaac
talking to me and he stopped, either because what
he wanted to say to Isaac was to be said in private,
or because he knew me and wanted to see what
would come of our talk. He saw me attack Isaac
and heard him call for help, but he didn’t come to
him because he’d hoped I’d kill him. That was
why he was so white when I saw him a minute or
two later. When he saw me leave Isaac Naylor and
run up the road, he backed his horse into the water
so as to make it seem as though he was just giving
it a drink. I don’t believe that he would have any
settled plan for doing this; it would be his instinct[236]
to do it. When he saw that Isaac was about to
escape after all, he rode up to where he was sitting
on the rock. Maybe they exchanged a few words;
maybe he just picked up the stake and struck
him where he sat, half dazed. I guess his mind
must have been all in a toss and ferment at what
he had seen me about to do, and the thought
flashed through him, why shouldn’t he finish what
he had seen me begin? I would be the one suspected,
for all the circumstances would point to me,
and I had come within a hair’s breadth of doing the
deed myself. After he had struck Isaac and saw
him lying in the grass, he realized what he had
done, then he turned and mounted his horse and
rode away. I think that this is so, because there
was only one blow given, and Dr. Winterapple said
in his evidence that he didn’t believe that it killed
him right away; if Moor had coolly intended to
kill Isaac, he would have made sure of it. This is
my notion of what happened; of course, I may be
mistaken in it.”

Tom turned as he ended, and looked at Will; the
other was gazing intently at him.

At last Will spoke: “I—I follow your thoughts,
Tom. It all sounds reasonable enough, but I must
have time to think it over. I—I can’t believe it,
somehow.”

“I don’t wonder at that,” said Tom, “beside, it’s
only my own notion of it. Some one did kill Isaac
Naylor, and it is clear that he was killed soon after
I left him, for he never got to Elihu Penrose’s[237]
house, and he was found dead just where I left him.
It only remains now to find out who it was. In my
opinion, the most likely one to have done it was
Mr. Moor. We must set about finding out several
things, and that I depend on your doing.”

“I’ll do all that I can,” said Will.

“Very well, then; we’ll throw aside all that I’ve
said, as to my notion of how it was done, and set to
work, with the point given that Mr. Moor might
have been the one that did the murder. The first
thing to find out, is whether he had cause for the
act. If there was no cause, of course, everything
falls to the ground. Who is Isaac Naylor’s lawyer?”

“White &amp; Tenny, I think.”

“Then the first thing to find, is whether Mr.
Moor was tangled in some business trouble with
Isaac; can you do that?”

“I don’t know; I’ll try.”

“The next thing to find out, is whether Mr. Moor
really was sick yesterday morning. If he was not
sick, he didn’t take a ride for his health, and must
have taken it on business. If he had any business,
it concerned Isaac Naylor, for he followed Isaac,
and went no where else, according to my notion.
The third thing to do, is to find what time he got
back home yesterday afternoon, and what he did
after he came home. Each one of these things
hangs on the other.”

Will sat in silence for a long time. At last he
stood up. “Tom,” said he, and his tones were
serious, almost solemn, “as I said before, all this is[238]
reasonable, and is wonderfully thought out I won’t
say off-hand that I think Mr. Moor did kill Isaac
Naylor, but I’ll say this,—I think he might have
done it. I’ll see what I can find out from White
&amp; Tenny—that I can manage myself. As to Mr.
Moor’s private movements, we’ll have to put some
one on the track of them that’s used to hunting up
evidence. When I was studying law with Mr.
Fargio, in Philadelphia, he had a fellow named
Daly, whom he employed in the case of Smithers
vs. Black. He’s a clever hand at ferreting out this
kind of evidence, and I’ll get him to run down here
and see what he can make out of this. The only
trouble with him, is that he drinks, but I guess I
can contrive to keep him sober till we’ve found out
all we want to know. And now I’ll have to leave
you, Tom, for I must set about my part of the
business. Though it’s hard for me to believe that
Mr. Moor was concerned in this—I’ll say this, I
don’t believe that you did it; you’ve convinced me
that far. I’ll say, too, that your reasoning against
Moor is very strong.”

“If you’ll wait a minute, Will, I’ll drop a line to
Patty, and get you to take it to her,” said Tom. “Of
course, you’ll keep secret all that’s been said between
us. You may tell the home folks, but don’t
let it go any further.”

“Of course, I won’t.”

Then, while Will walked up and down the floor
of the cell, Tom sat down and wrote his letter to
Patty. He represented his case very much as he[239]
had done to Will Gaines, and spoke cheerfully and
hopefully of his position.

He did not tell her anything about Mr. Moor;
he felt that it would be better not to do so, for her
father might chance to see the letter, and it behooved
them to keep the matter as quiet as possible.

Then he folded the letter and gave it to Will,
who left the cell without a word, but with a firm
grip of the hand at parting.



[240]




CHAPTER XIX.


IT was not until the next day at noon that Will
Gaines came to see Tom again; in the meantime,
Tom’s father and his brother John had visited
him. They had a long talk together, and, when
they left, they seemed hopeful, and even cheerful.
Will Gaines had told them of the suspicion that
Tom held against Mr. Moor. Tom repeated to them
what he had said the day before, and it seemed to
them to be almost unanswerable.

When Will came in about noon, Tom saw, at
once, that he was very much excited. He flung
himself down in the chair, and mopped his forehead
with his handkerchief.

“What’s the matter, Will?” said he, after waiting
for a while, and seeing that there was no immediate
prospect of his friend breaking the silence.

“Tom,” burst out Will, “if everything that
you’ve thought out in this case is as true as that
which I have just heard, I’ll acknowledge that
you are a most wonderful reasoner.”

“What have you learned?”

“I’ve just seen Sheriff Mathers.”

“Well?”[241]

“Well, to begin at the beginning, I went down to
White &amp; Tenny’s office yesterday, but didn’t find
either of them in. Their clerk was there, and said
that they wouldn’t be back till some time to-day. I
was just going down to their office a little while
ago, when I met Sheriff Mathers in front of the
Crown and Angel. He stopped me and began
asking me about your case; or rather about Isaac
Naylor’s death. I was just on the point of leaving
him, when he dropped out that it was a lucky thing
for some one in this town, that Isaac died when he
did. You may guess how this caught my ear, for
there was a deal of meaning in the sheriff’s tone. I
began inquiring about the matter, but he didn’t
give me very much satisfaction; he said that this
concerned another party entirely, and hadn’t anything
to do with the murder.

“‘Oh! it’s about Edmund Moor, is it?’ said I, as
easily as I could speak.

“‘How did you know that?’ said he; ‘What do
you know about the business?’

“Well, to make a long story short, after talking
to him a good while, I found that Isaac Naylor had
held a judgment against Moor (for how much I
don’t know), and was about to put the sheriff on
him. The judgment was to be lodged in the
sheriff’s hands the very day that Isaac was killed.
What do you think of that, Tom?”

There was silence for some time; Tom’s heart
was thumping against his ribs so that he could
hardly breathe. However, he spoke as quietly as[242]
he could. “I fancied that there must be something
of the kind,” said he.

Will eyed him for a moment or two, “You
seem to take it monstrously cool,” said he, at last.

Tom made no answer to this speech; after a while
he asked Will when he was going to send for the
man Daly, of whom he had spoken the day before.

“I have sent for him,” said Will. “I wrote a
note to Mr. Fargio yesterday, and urged haste in it.
I shouldn’t be surprised if Daly would be here in
to-morrow’s stage.”

Daly did come in the stage the next afternoon.
It was about five o’clock when the turnkey brought
a man to Tom’s cell whom he had never seen
before. “Mr. Gaines told me to bring you this
letter,” said the man, handing Tom a note as he
spoke; then Tom knew that it was Daly.

“Can’t you leave us a little while?” said Tom to
the turnkey.

Will’s note ran thus:



“Dear Tom:

“This is Daly of whom I spoke to you the other day.
I thought better to introduce you to him thus than to come
with him myself. You had better tell him everything concerning
the case, just as you told me. I think you may trust
him.


“W. W. Gaines.”


Tom looked at Daly as he folded Will’s note. I
cannot say that he took very much fancy to the
man. He was short, rather fat and bow-legged.
He had a large, heavy face, with a bluish growth
of beard about the lips and chin and cheeks. His[243]
head sat close upon his shoulders, and was covered
with a mat of close-cropped hair. He had a sly
hang-dog look, and anything but a pleasant expression.
So Tom, sitting on the edge of the table
where he had been reading Will’s note, looked at
Daly, and Daly stood returning the look out of the
corners of his eyes.

“So you’re John Daly, are you?” said Tom, at last.

“Yes.”

“Mr. Gaines says, in this note, that I may tell you
everything.”

“Well, I think you’d better.”

“Sit down.”

“Thank’ee; got a spitpatoon here?”

“There’s one.”

After using the spittoon, the fellow pushed it over
beside the chair with his foot. Then he sat down
comfortably. “Fire away,” said he.

“In the first place,” said Tom, “I’ll show you, as
I did Mr. Gaines, why, in my opinion, I couldn’t
have killed this man.” Then he ran over the
evidence just as I have already done, showing, by
the position of the blow, that he could not have
given it. Daly listened in silence, every now and
then nodding his head; but he did not speak a
word until Tom had ended. Then he looked up.

“Very true—very true, indeed,” said he. “It
satisfies me an’ your other friends; but it won’t go
down with a jury, just now. Reckon you ha’n’t
seen the papers lately?”

“No.”[244]

Daly nodded his head; “I guess your folks ha’
kept ’em from you,” he said; “there’s nasty tales
going about in ’em just now—tales about you an’
your mate deserting a ship, an’ leaving the captain
and the crew to drown in her.”

“But,” said Tom, “I didn’t leave the ship with
my own free will—I was taken off by force.”

“That may all be very true; I don’t question
your word at all—only this is the report of the
committee who examined you an’ your friend. You
ought to ha’ told ’em how you were taken off; you
had the chance.”

“But I wasn’t going to tell ugly things against
my mate, when he wouldn’t tell of them himself.”

“That’s all very fine, but he ha’n’t in prison for
murder.”

“I don’t see what this has to do with the matter,
anyhow.”

“Don’t you? Well, I’ll tell you. When your case
is before the jury, the prosecuting attorney’ll tell
’em that any man who’ld run away from his captain
and his shipmates, and leave ’em to drown, wouldn’t
hesitate to strike a man from behind. Of course, it
isn’t so, but the jury’ll believe it all the same.”

Tom was silent; he saw the weight of what the
man said, and his heart sank within him. Daly sat,
meditatively, chewing his tobacco. At last, after
expectorating copiously, he broke the silence.

“Never mind, sir,” said he; “I don’t believe that
you killed that feller; your argument’s good enough
for me. I know too much about this kind o’ thing[245]
to believe that you’re the sort of man to strike
another from behind. Mr. Gaines tells me that
you’re on the track of the man who did do it—let’s
have your idee.”

Then Tom told of all the circumstances that led
him to suspect Mr. Moor, and once more Daly
listened to him without a word. He sat with his
elbows on his knees; he had taken a dirty handkerchief
out of his hat, and was alternately crushing it
together and unfolding it in his hands. When Tom
had ended, he looked up at him from under his brows.

“You’ve thought all that out in a mighty derned
clever style,” said he. “It’s all as true as gospil.
I believe you’re right, and that this man Moor did
kill the other feller.”

“I couldn’t make Mr. Gaines believe it as you
do,” said Tom.

“Of course, you couldn’t. Mr. Gaines knows
this Moor, and always has known him. It’s hard
to believe that a man that you’ve seen under your
eye every day would do a thing like this. I
don’t know anything about him, and I can look at
it reasonable like. I believe he did do it. The
next thing is to ketch him, and that ain’t goin’ to
be so easy, neither, for, without I’m much mistook,
he’s as sharp as a steel trap. Never mind, he’ll
have to get up early in the morning if he’s going
to get ahead of ‘Fatty’ Daly, I can tell you.”

After this he took up his hat and quitted the gaol,
and Tom was left alone again.

Two or three days passed before there were any[246]
more developments. Will kept Tom well posted
as to the agent’s movements, but nothing of any
note happened.

The first thing that Daly did was to become
acquainted with Mr. Moor’s help, who, being rather
old and not over-handsome, was glad for any young
man to come courting her—even such an one as
Daly. However, the agent was cautious, and nothing
was found out for two or three days.

On the morning of the third day after Daly had
come to Eastcaster, Will came into Tom’s cell in a
great state of hurry and excitement. Daly had
found something that he thought was of great
moment.

“I want you to tell me your idea of the matter
before I give you Daly’s,” said he. “The fellow
seems to have a great notion of your ability and
told me to find what your opinion was and see
whether his agreed with it.” Then he handed Tom
a sheet or two of paper, covered with a crooked,
blotted scrawl. It was Daly’s report; it ran thus:



“Last evening went to Mr. Moor’s house to see his
servant girl Susan. Up to that time had not said anything
about murder, but then began to talk about it. Began by
asking how Mr. Moor was, and said that I was sorry to
hear he was sick. Girl said that he had not been well for
three or four days. She said that he was very sick the
morning that he was at squire’s office, and that he came
home and laid down on the sofa that morning and laid there
almost all day. Asked her if he had been sick the day before,
and she said not until evening when he came home sick from
a ride that he took. Began questioning her about this and[247]
got all from her without her suspecting anything, I think.
Said that he came home after dark and went straight to his
room. Heard him walking up and down for some time.
Supper was ready before he came in. He came in at half-past
six, for she looked at clock when she heard him open
front door. Came down stairs in a half an hour, and she
went out to tell him that supper was ready. He spoke
sharply to her, and said that he did not want any supper.
He turned at the door and spoke more quietly. Said, on
second thoughts, that she might save supper for him. He
had a carpet-bag in his hand and a hat on at the time. He
said that there were papers in the carpet-bag, and that he
was going to see a Mr. Henry Sharpley on business. He
came back in half an hour, with mud on his shoes, which
left tracks in the entry. He went out just about seven
o’clock, and came back at half-past seven. Questioned
servant girl closely as dared as to time. Said that she
noticed time, because she was keeping supper waiting for
Mr. Moor. When he came in, drank two cups of coffee, but
did not touch any supper.”

Such was Daly’s report. After Tom had read it,
he folded it up, and sat for a while thinking deeply.
Presently he looked at Will. “Will,” said he, “I
believe I know what Daly thinks.”

“What?”

“That Mr. Moor had blood on his clothes, and
went out to hide them.”

“That’s just what he does think, Tom.”

“And I believe that he’s right; Mr. Moor certainly
had something to hide, and it could have
been nothing, without it was evidence. All that
Daly gathered from the servant girl goes to show
that there was something of the kind. I believe
that Mr. Moor would have gone straight home after[248]
he had done the deed, if he had dared to do so, and
he would have dared, without he had some signs of
what he had done upon him. What signs of the
deed could he have had about him, if it was not
blood spattered on his clothes? Now, if we can
find that he has hidden any of his clothes in some
out-of-the-way place, we’ll have a great point gained,
won’t we?”

“We will, indeed.”

“Has Daly any notion of where they were
hidden?”

“No.”

“Have you?”

“Not I.”

“What’s Daly going to do about it?”

“His idea is to hunt in all the likely places near
at hand on the chance of finding them. He says
that they can’t be far away, because Mr. Moor was
such a short time gone; only half an hour.”

“That’s very true, but, without he has something
to guide him in his search, it’ll be like hunting for
a needle in a hay-stack.”

“Have you any notion about it, Tom?”

“Not yet,” said Tom; “let me think.” He buried
his face in his hands, and sat for a long time without
moving. At last, he opened the note that Daly had
sent him, and looked at it again. Presently he
spoke:

“Now, Will, let’s start from the time that he was
supposed to have struck the blow, and let’s trace
him as well as we can. After he had struck Isaac[249]
down, and saw that he had killed him, and also saw
that there were signs upon him what might point to
his having done the deed, he wouldn’t go out either
into the turnpike or the mill road, for he would be
afraid of some one meeting him. He would go
into the woods, and would hide there until dark.
He must have suffered horribly in the woods at
night, with the thought of what he had done fresh
upon his heart—of course, it would unfit him for
any cool and collected thinking, and therefore we
have an advantage over him. At last he comes
home. Try to put yourself in his place, and
conceive of the terrible state of mind that he must
have been in at the time. There would be blood
upon his clothes, and his first thought would be to
get rid of them as soon as possible. If he had
been cool, he would have waited until the next day,
but he did not think of any such thing at the time.
‘Where shall I hide them?’ he would say to himself;
‘not at home, not about the house, for who
knows how soon they may be found?’ Then he
would go over a number of places in his mind. He
would not be collected enough to think of some
out-of-the-way spot; he would think of some place
that he had seen before, and that would be remarkable
enough for him to remember it, even at
such a moment. Now, let’s see what he did,
according to that which the servant girl told Daly.
He doesn’t see the servant girl when he first comes
into the house, but, after he had stuffed his clothes
into a carpet-bag, and had come down stairs again,[250]
he meets her face to face, and shows very plainly
how much the sight of her has disturbed him. He
tells her sharply enough for her to remember that
he don’t want any supper. The next minute the
thought comes to him that she’ll think his actions
very strange, so he turns around and gives her an
explanation of his movements, such as he would
never think of doing in an ordinary case. He tells
her that he is going to Henry Sharpley’s, on business.
Without I’m mistaken, he made a blunder
there that will give help to us. So far we can follow
him tolerably well. Now, we have a gape of half
an hour, and that gape we’ve got to fill up.”

“That’s just it,” said Will.

“We’ll leave that now, and see what he did after
he came home. The girl was a very careful housekeeper,
for she noticed that he had mud on his
shoes, and that he left tracks in the house. She
wouldn’t have noticed that without she had an eye
to keeping things clean. He told her to save
supper for him, and yet he ate nothing. That, I
think, is all that we really know.”

“That’s all.”

“And now, to fill up the gape of half an hour—Have
you had any rain lately?”

“Well—let me see. No; there’s been none for
over a week.”

“Well, that’s a great point gained, for the roads
must be very dusty.”

“They are.”

“Then, how could Mr. Moor have mud on his[251]
shoes in going to Henry Sharpley’s house and back
again? His shoes might have been dusty, but they
couldn’t have been muddy. He must have been in
some wet or marshy place to get mud on him.”

“That’s so.”

“Well, that’s one point gained. Now, let’s see
how much the servant girl can be relied upon as to
the length of time that he was gone. She said that
he left at seven o’clock and came back at half-past
seven. The time was impressed upon her mind
because she was keeping supper waiting for him.
She was a careful housekeeper, as we’ve seen, so, no
doubt, she kept a watch on the clock while she was
keeping the victuals and dishes warm. I think we
may take it for granted that she was pretty nearly
right as regards the time. He was gone half an
hour, therefore he was not more than a quarter
of an hour’s walk from home—a mile, let’s say. I
think we may say that he went straight to the place
where he hid his clothes, and that he came straight
home again after he had hidden them; it would be
the natural thing for him to do. So we may feel
tolerably sure that he didn’t go more, and not much
less, than a mile from home.”

Here Tom stopped, and sat for a long time buried
in thought. Will did not say anything, but waited
for him to begin again. At last Tom broke the
silence.

“Now,” said he, “it would be a hard thing for us
to follow Moor with only the mud on his shoes as
a clue to guide us, but to my thinking he himself[252]
gave us a better hint than this, by one word too
much that he spoke. He told the help girl that he
was going to see Henry Sharpley, and this he told
her on the spur of the moment, with hardly a
second thought. It isn’t likely that he would have
mentioned Henry Sharpley’s name without Henry
was in his mind at the time. If this wasn’t so, why
should he mention that special name? Now, he
was either going to see Henry, as he said, or he
was going in the direction where he knew Henry
was to be found.

“He did not go to see Henry, because it would
have taken more than half an hour to talk over
business concerning a whole carpet-bag full of
papers, so I think we may take it for granted that
he went in the direction of Henry Sharpley’s house.
Now, if we can find that his actions fit perfectly
with this idea, we can feel pretty certain that we are
right. Let’s try to think how we would do if we
were in Mr. Moor’s place. Let’s say that I’m going
to hide these clothes. I have thought of a place
not very far distant. That place is out of town,
but not far. I quit the town just beyond Henry
Sharpley’s house. I say to myself, if I can slip out
quietly and hide these things, I’ll be back in a little
while, and I’ll just mention that I went out on a
little matter of business. I go down stairs with this
on my mind, and come suddenly face to face with
the help. She catches me in the act of going out
of the house with the carpet-bag in my hand.
What will she think of it? She says something[253]
about supper—a little thing to speak of in my
present state of mind. Without thinking, I speak
sharply to her. The next minute it strikes me
that her suspicions will be increased by the strangeness
of my speech and actions. I am anxious to
set myself right with her, and, not knowing of anything
better to say at the moment, I tell her what
I had already planned to do—that I was going
out on business. In the flurry of the moment I
say one word too much. I am going in the direction
of Henry Sharpley’s house; my mind is full of
where I am going; so, without a second thought,
I tell her that I am going to see Henry Sharpley
on business. Then it flashes across me that the
girl will wonder what I am doing with my carpet-bag
at that time of the night. I can think of no
other explanation to give than that it is full of
papers. Does all that sound reasonable?”

Will drew a deep breath. “Reasonable?” said
he; “of course it sounds reasonable.”

“Of course, I may be all at sea in what I fancy.
At the same I may be right, and it’s worth having a
try for. Now, we’ll take for granted that Mr. Moor
did go down Beaver street toward Sharpley’s house.
Of course, he wouldn’t go out aimlessly into the
night; he had some place already fixed in his mind
where to hide his clothes, and he went straight to
that place with as few steps aside as possible. Now,
it would seem at first as though he had thought
of some place to hide his clothes near Sharpley’s
house or the blacksmith shop opposite; but two[254]
reasons stand in the way of this. In the first
place, his mind would be in too much confusion to
think deliberately of any cunning plan. If he had
waited until the next day, it might have been different.
I think he had a place fixed in his mind when
he came home; he certainly doesn’t seem to have
spent much time in laying plans. In the second
place, he was gone half an hour. It wouldn’t have
taken him five minutes to walk to Sharpley’s and
back, and I don’t believe he would tarry anywhere
in the dark after he had hidden his clothes. Beside
all this, he told the servant girl that he would be
back inside of an hour. He told her this at the
moment of meeting her, and it isn’t likely that he
would have said it if he hadn’t a longish distance in
his mind at the time. He would have to walk
along the street while he was in town, for he
wouldn’t go cutting across people’s gardens and
climbing fences. So he wouldn’t leave the sidewalk
till he had come to Sharpley’s house or the blacksmith
shop, which are the last houses before you
come to open lots. As soon as he was out of town,
he would strike a straight line for the place that he
had in his mind—and now, let’s see how far he
went.

“We’ll say it took him three minutes to walk
to Sharpley’s house; that leaves twelve minutes of
the quarter of an hour. Say it took him four
minutes to hide his clothes when he had come to
the spot that he had in his mind. The half of
four is two; that leaves ten minutes for him to[255]
walk after he had left the town. If he’d kept to
the road he might have walked three quarters of a
mile in that time; but he didn’t do that, for he got
his shoes muddy somewhere. Beside, it isn’t likely
that he would walk along the highroad at night
with a carpet bag in his hand. It’ld look mighty
strange to any one who’d meet him. If he had to
walk across lots and climb fences, he couldn’t have
covered over half a mile in ten minutes; nor is it
likely he would walk less than a quarter of a mile.
Now, imagine a pair of big compasses. Open them
till they measure a half a mile from point to point;
put one point of them on the road between the
blacksmith shop and Sharpley’s house and draw a
circle. Now draw another circle of a quarter of a
mile from point to point. You now have a belt a
quarter of a mile wide running in a circle a quarter
of a mile distant from the blacksmith shop. If I’ve
argued the matter right, you’ll find his clothes
hidden somewhere in that belt.”

Will heaved a deep sigh. “Tom,” said he, “you
ought to be the lawyer, and I the accused. You’d
make a better fist out of my case than I’ll ever be
able to do out of yours. I’ll put Daly on the track
right away, and see what he makes of it.”

“Hold hard, Will,” said Tom; “as we’ve gone
this far, we might as well see whether we can’t go a
little farther. Let’s see in what kind of a place Mr.
Moor would be likely to hide those clothes. He’d
think of only very simple plans in his state of mind,
I take it. He might bury them, or burn them, or[256]
sink them in the water somewhere. He didn’t
bury them, for he took no tools with him, and he
couldn’t very well have done it without. Woolen
clothes, such as a man wears at this time of the
year, don’t burn very easily, and he’d have to go a
long distance before he dared build a fire, and, beside,
he hadn’t time to do it in the half of an hour
that he was gone. Of the three the most likely
thing for him to do would be to throw his clothes
in the water. Another point is that his shoes were
muddy, and so he must have been where it was wet.
We have seen that the place he hid his clothes was
about a half a mile out of town, and that it was a
place such as would occur to him at this time.”
Tom stopped abruptly, and rose to his feet.
“Will,” cried he, “can’t you guess where he sunk
his clothes?”

“Tom—you—you mean the old quarry, don’t
you?”

Tom nodded his head. Will sat looking at him
for a time, without speaking.

“Will,” said Tom, presently, “that place was in
my mind almost from the very first. I wasn’t
arguing to find it, but to prove to myself that I was
right. Now, the whole thing amounts to this—if
we drag the quarry, and find the clothes there, I’ve
made a good guess.”

“You have, indeed—a good enough guess to get
your neck out of the halter. I’ll say nothing more;
only this—I didn’t think that you had so much in
you!”



[257]




CHAPTER XX.


AND now I find the story of Tom Granger’s
adventures drawing rapidly to a close. I
have sometimes wondered whether all happenings,
such as are usually allotted to a man’s life, were not
crowded into this one year and a half, for since that
time it has been even and uneventful, excepting as
to such small things as occur in our quiet Quaker
neighborhood.

But, these adventures were not to close without
one more thing happening that made a stir; not only
in Eastcaster, but throughout the whole country.
No doubt, if you were to pick up a newspaper of
the fall and winter of that year, no matter where
that paper was printed, you would see some mention
made of all these things.

However, I have nothing to do with that; I have
only to tell my own story, or the balance of it as
quickly as possible, for it has grown to a huge
length beneath my hands as I have worked upon it,
so much, so that I fear few will have patience to
read it through to the end.

I think that it was about noon of the next day
that a note was brought to Tom. It was in Will’s[258]
handwriting, and was only of one line. This is
what it said:



“Dragged the quarry this morning. Clothes found.


“W. W. G.”


Heretofore, Tom had been surprised at his own
endurance. I think that he was braced more tensely
than he had any idea of, and that now came the
reaction that is sure to follow overtaxing of the
powers. After he had read the note, and had seen
how truly his surmises had been fulfilled, he grew
weak and nervous. Every now and then a spell of
trembling would pass over him, and at last he flung
himself down upon the cot, and buried his face in
the pillow. “I’d better have died! I’d better have
died!” he kept repeating to himself; for, it seemed
to him, as though his coming to Eastcaster had
brought misery upon every one with whom he had
to do. But for him Isaac would have been alive at
this time, and Mr. Moor would never have had the
burthen of such a great crime upon his soul. At
last he fell into a nervous sleep, though, in truth, he
scarcely knew whether it was sleep or not, for he
seemed to be conscious of everything that was
around him. Between twelve and one o’clock his
course prison fare was brought in to him. He
heard the turnkey open the door, lay the platter of
victuals on the table, and then go out again, but he
heard it as though it were all a part of the troubled
dreams that were upon him. Through his half
sleep he heard the court-house bell strike one, and[259]
two, and three and four o’clock, and still he lay
there. Suddenly there were footsteps in the corridor,
a rattle of the key in the lock, and then some
one burst into the room. Tom roused himself and
sat up—it was Will Gaines. Tom began to tremble,
for there was a very strange look in Will’s face.
He flung himself down on the chair, and wiped his
brow, which was wet with sweat.

“Tom,” said he, at last, in a low, solemn voice,
“what do you think’s happened?”

Tom sprang to his feet, and held out both hands,
as though to defend himself. “Oh, Will, Will!”
cried he, hoarsely; “don’t tell me any more! I
can’t bear any more!”

“But you must hear this,” said Will.

Tom sat down upon his cot again. “Well,” said
he, at last, in a dull voice; “tell me, if you must.”

“Edmund Moor has committed suicide.”

Tom looked fixedly at Will, and it seemed as
though he was a long distance away. The room
appeared to lengthen out on all sides of him. Then
there was a sound of rushing and roaring in his
ears, and a dark cloud seemed to rise and shut in
everything from his sight. He heard Will’s voice
calling to him, as though from afar—“Tom, Tom,
are you sick?”

He tried to shape the words, but it seemed as
though his lips had no power to move. He felt
Will’s arms around him; there was a humming in
his ears, and a tingling at his finger tips, and then
the dark cloud passed away, and he saw everything.[260]

“I’m better now,” said he, and then he sat up.
Will was standing in front of him, holding a tumbler
of water. He reached out and took the glass,
and drained it at a swallow, and it seemed to bring
fresh life to him.

“I guess I’d better not tell you any more,” said
Will.

“No, I’ll hear all now,” said Tom; “the worst’s
over.” Then, after a pause, “When did it happen?”

“About a couple of hours ago.”

“Did he—did he—” Tom stopped and looked
at Will.

“He left a confession,” said Will.

“Tell me all about it,” said Tom.

“Well, by noon I had got together all the evidence
I had at hand, and about one o’clock I went
up to swear out a warrant for Moor’s arrest, at the
squire’s. The squire wasn’t in, and I waited about
half an hour. Then I slipped down to the office, to
see what had become of Daly. He had promised
to come up to the squire’s and meet me at one
o’clock, and here it was half-past one, and no signs
of him. He had left me at half-past twelve, saying
that he was going to get dinner, and that he would
come over as soon as he had done. I was afraid
that something was wrong, for I had a notion that
he had been drinking this morning. However, I
thought it just possible that he might be at the
office. But there was no signs of him, so I went
out again and stood on the sidewalk, looking for
him up and down the street. Who should come[261]
along, but Mr. Moor. He stopped, and began
talking to me, and I couldn’t help thinking that he
suspected something, though, of course, he didn’t.
I can’t tell you how I felt, Tom, to have that fellow
talking to me about little trivial things, joking all
the time, as he was given to doing. I don’t know
how I answered, but I guess that it was all at
random. Just then I saw Daly come out of the
Crown and Angel, across the street. He staggered
as he came down the steps, and stood on the sidewalk,
looking all around him. I saw that he was
as drunk as a lord, and was afraid that nothing
could be done at the squire’s that day. As luck
would have it, he caught sight of Mr. Moor talking
to me, and he came right across the street to where
we were, staggering like a brute. As soon as he
came to us he caught hold of Mr. Moor’s hand and
began shaking it. Mr. Moor tried to pass it off as
a joke, for he saw how drunk the fellow was. But
I was on pins and needles all the time, I can tell
you.

“‘What do you mean, sir?’ said I; ‘go into the
office.’

“‘You be d—d!’ was all that the fellow said to
me. Then he turned to Moor. ‘Mr. Moor,’ says
he, ‘you’re a good feller—a good feller! I’m d—d
sorry for what you did, for you’re a good feller. I
know all about it (here he winked), but, between
you and me, I don’t care a d—n.’

“There wasn’t a shade of color in Moor’s face.
‘What do you mean, you scoundrel?’ said he.[262]

“Daly straightened himself up with all the dignity
that he could manage. ‘Scoundrel, eh?’ said
he. ‘Oh! all right! I’m a scoundrel, am I? We’ll
fix you for that; won’t we, Mr. Gaines? I reckon
you thought no one’ld find them old clo’s o’ yourn,
didn’t you?’

“I never saw such a look come over any man’s
face in all my life, as came over Moor’s. He went
staggering back, as though he had been shot. I
turned on the scoundrel, hardly knowing what I
did, I was in such a towering rage. I left fly at
him, and knocked him nearly into the middle of the
street. He jumped up and ran at me, swearing like
a soldier, and as soon as he had come within
distance, I left fly another blow, and down he went
again, for he was too drunk to guard himself. By
this time a crowd had gathered, running from all
directions. Some of them caught hold of Daly
and held him, and he stood there cursing and
swearing as I never heard a man curse and swear
before. When I had time to look around again, I
saw that Moor had gone. I asked Jerry White,
who was standing near,—if he had seen him, and he
said yes; that he had caught sight of him running
down Market street, as though he was going home.
By this time there was a crowd around me, all
wanting to know what was the matter, and I told
them in as few words as I could. A lot of them
ran down to Beaver street, which suited me very
well, for they would keep Moor in sight if he were
to try to get away. Daly was washing the blood[263]
from his face in the trough before the Crown and
Angel, and what with the licking and the pump
water, he was pretty sober by this time. He was
very sorry at what had happened, and didn’t seem
to bear me any grudge. I waited till he had made
himself as decent looking as he could, and then
went up to the squire’s with him, though he had a
bad eye where I had struck him. We found the
squire, and he gave me the warrant against Moor.
I had a hard time to find the sheriff, but I got him
at last. This was about two o’clock.

“He and I went down to Beaver street together.
There was a great crowd around Moor’s house by
this time, and the house itself was shut up as
though no one was in it. The sheriff tried the
office door, but found it locked. Then he went to
the house door, and knocked a long while before
he could get any answer, but at last the servant girl
came. She seemed very much frightened at all the
crowd and excitement, but she told us that Mr.
Moor had come in about half an hour before, and
had not gone out again. The sheriff told her that
he had a warrant for Mr. Moor’s arrest, and asked
her to show him into the office. The servant led
us across the parlor to the door that opens into the
office from the house.

“The sheriff knocked at the door, calling; ‘Mr.
Moor! Mr. Moor! You might as well let us in!
If you don’t let us in, I’ll have to force the door!’
But no one answered him. By that time the parlor
was pretty full of men, who had followed us in[264]
from the street. Sheriff Mathers shook at the
door, and knocked for some time, calling to Moor
to open it, but getting no answer. After a while, he
peeped through the key hole. I asked him whether
he could see anything of Moor; he said yes—he
was standing in the corner. Then I advised him to
force the door, and he did so, putting his shoulder
to it. He had to push pretty hard, so that when
the door broke open, he ran into the room, nearly
falling down. He gave a cry and ran out against
Johnny Black, who was just going in. I didn’t go
into the room, but I could see over Black’s shoulder
that Moor was hanging from a rope that was tied to
a large hook in the corner of the room. He left a
few lines lying on his office desk, confessing that it
was he who murdered Isaac Naylor, and that he
was tired of the misery of living. I can’t remember
them exactly, but they were read before the coroner’s
jury.

“As soon as I saw how matters had turned out, I
hunted up Judge West. He went down with me to
the squire’s, without losing a moment, for he said
that no innocent man should be kept in gaol longer
than need be. It took about an hour to get the
needful witnesses together. As soon as the matter
was settled the judge gave the release, and—”

Here Will stopped abruptly. He stood listening,
and presently Tom heard a scuffling of feet out in the
corridor. The door was opened, and his father and
his brothers, John and William, came into the cell.

“Are you ready now?” said Will.[265]

“Yes,” said Tom’s father; “I borrowed Philip
Winterapple’s gig. It’s waiting at the door.”

“Are you ready to go, Tom?”

“Ready to go where?” said Tom, looking about
him in a dazed way.

“Ready to go home.”

In this simple manner, and with these few words
was his bitter trouble brought to a close.

Well, that is all the yarn concerning Tom Granger
that need be told. The troubles that had
followed him in the year and a half past had been
bitter indeed, but they had all gone by now. I am
not going to tell you how he married, and how he
lived happily, and all that sort of matter. Surely,
such a home as I see around me, and such a crowd
of loving faces as gather about me at times, children,
grand-children, and three great-grand-children,
bespeak a life not all unhappy of its kind.

Even yet, beside me is that one whose face,
always sweet, now shines with a light that comes
not of this life, but of the life beyond. I do thank
the Giver of all good things that He has permitted
us to walk the path of life hand-in-hand together
for this long time. A day or two now, and one of
us may go—I care not which it be, for the other
will not be long in tarrying.

What matters then all these troubles of which I
have been telling you! Such troubles, bitter and
keen at the time, are but as a breath on the glass of
life, that fade away, and are gone long before that
glass itself is shivered.[266]

So, as I say, these sorrows and griefs that were
once so bitter to me, stir me not at this day, saving
now and then, while, as I sat writing these lines, a
chord of memory did ring occasionally to the
touch. Yes; all is gone by—happiness and grief,
joy and suffering, and I am like a ship, one time
battered and buffeted with the bitter storms of
trouble and despair, but now, full freighted with my
cargo of years, safe at anchor in my peaceful haven
Within the Capes.



THE END.

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
