<h2><a name="NOTICE_OF_THE_AUTHOR" id="NOTICE_OF_THE_AUTHOR"></a>
NOTICE OF THE AUTHOR.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The Reverend Nathaniel Ward</span>, the writer of the following
work, was born at Haverhill, England, in 1570. Of
this town his father was a clergyman. He was educated at
Cambridge, studied and practised law, travelled on the Continent,
afterwards commenced the study of divinity, became
a preacher of the Gospel, and was settled at Standon, in
Hertfordshire. He was a strong friend of the early settlers
of New England before the elder Winthrop's coming over.
At a General Court of the Massachusetts Company, held
in London, on Wednesday the 25th of November, 1629,
"Mr. Whyte did recom&#773;end Mr. Nathaniel Ward of Standon"
to be admitted to the freedom of the Company. He
was ordered before the Bishop, Dec. 12, 1631, to answer
for his non-conformity. Being forbidden to preach, he embarked
in April, 1634, for this country. He arrived here
in June, and was settled as Pastor of the church at Ipswich,
<!-- Page 3 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>or Aggawam, the same year. By reason of indisposition,
he was, at his own request, in 1636, released from his engagement
with the church there. However thus disengaged,
he preached often during the time he remained in the
colony. The necessities of the infant Commonwealth called
for his time, talents, and acquirements. Nor did he
refuse. Willing to do the good, which he might, he lent a
ready and efficient hand to the formation of our Legal Code.
He was appointed by the General Court, March 12, 1638,
on a committee to draw up a system of laws, for the consideration
of the freemen. The same legislative authority,
May 13, 1640, granted him six hundred acres of land for
his service, at Pentucket, afterwards called Haverhill. He
preached the election sermon, 1641, in which he advanced
several things that savored more of liberty, than some of
the magistrates were prepared to approve. The same year,
Oct. 7, "The Govern'<sup>r</sup> and m<sup>r</sup> Hauthorne were Desired
to speake to m<sup>r</sup> Ward, for a coppey of the liberties, and of
the Capitall lawes to bee transcribed, and sent to the severall
townes." He wrote the "Simple Cobler" in 1645. In
this year, May 25, he was on a committee to draw up a
Body of Liberties, which were published in 1648, being the
first printed volume of the kind in this Colony. Though
greatly assisted by Joseph Hills and others in the composition
and arrangement of so important a work, yet he appears
to have been a principal agent in its accomplishment.
He sold his interest at Haverhill, Nov. 25, 1646, to John
Eaton, for &pound;12,00. Between this date and the 6th of January
following, he returned to England. On June 30th,
1647, he preached before the House of Commons, and the
<!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>same year published the "Simple Cobler." He was afterwards
settled in the ministry at Shenfield, near Brentwood,
where he died in 1653, in his eighty-third year.</p>

<p>Fuller, in his "Worthies of England," speaking of him,
says, that he, "following the counsel of the poet,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ridentem dicere verum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quis vetat?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What doth forbid but one may smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And also tell the truth the while?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>hath in a jesting way, in some of his books, delivered much
smart truth of the present times." Dr. Mather, in his
"Magnalia," remarks of him, "he was the author of many
composures full of wit and sense; among which, that entituled
<i>The Simple Cobler</i> (<i>which demonstrated him to be a
subtil statesman</i>) was most considered." The same author
adds, that "some famous persons of old thought it a greater
<i>glory</i> to have it enquired; <i>why such a one had not a
statue erected for him?</i> than to have it enquired <i>why he
had</i>? If it be enquired, <i>why this our</i> St. Hilary <i>hath among
our Lives no statue erected for him</i>? let that enquiry go for
part of one." And in the "Remarkables" of Increase
Mather, he observes, "An hundred witty Speeches of our
Celebrated <i>Ward</i>, who called himself <i>The Simple Cobler</i>
of Agawam, [and over whose Mantel-piece in his House, by
the way, I have seen those three Words Engraved, SOBRIE,
JUSTE, PIE, and a Fourth added, which was L&AElig;TE:]
have been reported; but he had one Godly Speech, that
was worth 'em all; which was, <i>I have only Two Comforts to<!-- Page 5 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Live upon; The one is in the Perfections of CHRIST;
The other is in The Imperfections of all CHRISTIANS.</i>"</p>

<p>Mr. Ward had several children. Among them, were
John, settled in the ministry at Haverhill, Mass., where he
died, 1693; James, who practised medicine; and a daughter,
married to Gyles Fyrmin. These three last accompanied
their father to England.</p>

<p>To illustrate how much Mr. Ward benevolently labored
for the public good with but small recompense, we quote
another remark of Cotton Mather, as to his son John. It
follows: "He was a son most exemplarily <i>dutiful</i> unto his
<i>parents</i>; and having paid some considerable <i>debts</i> for his
<i>father</i>, he would afterwards humbly observe and confess,
that God had abundantly <i>recompenced</i> this his dutifulness."
Whether these debts were paid in Old or New England is
uncertain.</p>

<p>Thus we have given a sketch of one, who deserves well
of New England and of friends to freedom every where,&mdash;so
that it might be more evident how he and the subsequent
work were estimated by his contemporaries and successors.</p>

<h3><a name="NOTE" id="NOTE"></a>NOTE.</h3>

<p>This work passed through several editions at London
in 1647. It was reprinted in Boston in 1713.
One of the earlier editions and that of 1713 have
been used in preparing the present edition for the
press. After his first impression, the author made
several additions to succeeding ones, which will be
found in this now issued.&mdash;The principal of these
additions are as follow: "A Word of Love to the
Common People of England," "A most humble Heel
piece," &amp;c., and "A respective word to the Ministers
of England."</p>

<p>Either I am in an Appoplexie, or that man
is in a Lethargie, who doth not now sensibly
feele God shaking the Heavens over
his head, and the Earth under his feet:
The Heavens so, as the Sun begins to turne
into darknesse, the Moon into blood, the
Starres to fall down to the ground; So that little Light
of Comfort or Counsell is left to the sonnes of men:
The Earth so, as the foundations are failing, the
righteous scarce know where to finde rest, the Inhabitants
stagger like drunken men; it is in a manner
dissolved both in Religions and Relations: And no
marvell; for, they have defiled it by transgressing
the Laws, changing the Ordinances, and breaking the
Everlasting Covenant. The Truths of God are the
Pillars of the world, whereon States and Churches
may stand quiet if they will; if they will not, He
can easily shake them off into delusions, and distractions
enough.</p>

<p>Sathan is now in his passions, hee feeles his passion
approaching; hee loves to fish in royled waters.
Though that Dragon cannot sting the vitals of the<!-- Page 9 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Elect mortally, yet that Beelzebub can fly-blow their
Intellectuals miserably: The finer Religion grows,
the finer hee spins his Cobwebs, hee will hold pace
with Christ so long as his wits will serve him. Hee
sees himselfe beaten out of grosse Idolatries, Heresies,
Ceremonies, where the Light breakes forth with power;
he will therefore bestirre him to prevaricate Evangelicall
Truths, and Ordinances, that if they will
needs be walking, yet they shall <i>laborare varicibus</i>,
and not keep their path: he will put them out of time
and place; Assascinating for his Engineers, men of
Paracelsian parts; well complexioned for honesty;
for, such are fittest to Mountebanke his Chimistry
into sicke Churches and weake Judgements.</p>

<p>Nor shall hee neede to stretch his strength overmuch
in this worke: Too many men having not laid their
foundation sure, nor ballasted their Spirits deepe with
humility and feare, are prest enough of themselves to
evaporate their owne apprehensions. Those that are
acquainted with Story know, it hath ever been so in
new Editions of Churches: Such as are least able,
are most busie to pudder in the rubbish, and to raise
dust in the eyes of more steady Repayrers. Civill
Commotions make roome for uncivill practises: Religious
mutations, for irreligious opinions: Change of
Aire, discovers corrupt bodies; Reformation of Religion,
unsound mindes. He that hath any well-faced
phancy in his Crowne, and doth not vent it now, fears
the pride of his owne heart will dub him dunce for
ever. Such a one will trouble the whole <i>Israel</i> of
God with his most untimely births, though he makes<!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the bones of his vanity sticke up, to the view and
griefe of all that are godly wise. The devill desires
no better sport then to see light heads handle their
heels, and fetch their carreers in a time, when the
Roofe of Liberty stands open.</p>

<p>The next perplexed Question, with pious and ponderous
men, will be: What should bee done for the
healing of these comfortlesse exulcerations. I am the
unablest adviser of a thousand, the unworthiest of
ten thousand; yet I hope I may presume to assert
what follows without just offence.</p>

<p>First, such as have given or taken any unfriendly
reports of us <i>New-English</i>, should do well to recollect
themselves. We have beene reputed a Colluvies
of wild Opinionists, swarmed into a remote wildernes
to find elbow-roome for our phanatick Doctrines
and practises: I trust our diligence past, and constant
sedulity against such persons and courses, will plead
better things for us. I dare take upon me, to bee the
Herauld of <i>New-England</i> so farre, as to proclaime to
the world, in the name of our Colony, that all Familists,
Antinomians, Anabaptists, and other Enthusiasts,
shall have free Liberty to keep away from us, and
such as will come to be gone as fast as they can, the
sooner the better.</p>

<p>Secondly, I dare averre, that God doth no where
in his word tolerate Christian States, to give Tolerations
to such adversaries of his Truth, if they have
power in their hands to suppresse them.</p>

<p>Here is lately brought us an extract of a <i>Magna
Charta</i>, so called, compiled between the Sub-planters<!-- Page 11 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
of a <i>West-Indian</i> Island; whereof the first Article of
constipulation, firmely provides free stable-room and
litter for all kinde of consciences, be they never so
dirty or jadish; making it actionable, yea, treasonable,
to disturbe any man in his Religion, or to discommend
it, whatever it be. Wee are very sorry to
see such professed profanenesse in <i>English</i> Professors,
as industriously to lay their Religious Foundations
on the ruine of true Religion; which strictly
binds every conscience to contend earnestly for the
Truth: to preserve unity of spirit, faith and Ordinances,
to be all like-minded, of one accord; every man
to take his brother into his Christian care: to stand
fast with one spirit, with one mind, striving together
for the faith of the Gospel: and by no meanes to permit
Heresies or erroneous opinions: But God abhorring
such loathsome beverages, hath in his righteous judgement
blasted that enterprize, which might otherwise
have prospered well, for ought I know; I presume
their case is generally knowne ere this.</p>

<p>If the devill might have his free option, I believe
he would ask nothing else, but liberty to enfranchize
all false Religions, and to embondage the true; nor
should he need: It is much to bee feared, that laxe
Tolerations upon State pretences and planting necessities,
will be the next subtle Stratagem he will spread,
to distate the Truth of God and supplant the peace of
the Churches. Tolerations in things tolerable, exquisitely
drawn out by the lines of the Scripture, and
pensill of the Spirit, are the sacred favours of Truth,
the due latitudes of Love, the faire Compartiments of<!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
Christian fraternity: but irregular dispensations, dealt
forth by the facilities of men, are the frontiers of errour,
the redoubts of Schisme, the perillous irritaments
of carnall and spirituall enmity.</p>

<p>My heart hath naturally detested foure things:
The standing of the Apocrypha in the Bible; Forrainers
dwelling in my Countrey, to crowd our native
Subjects into the corners of the Earth; Alchymized
coines; Tolerations of divers Religions, or of one
Religion in segregant shapes: He that willingly assents
to the last, if he examines his heart by day-light,
his conscience will tell him, he is either an Atheist,
or an Heretique, or an Hypocrite, or at best a captive
to some lust: Poly-piety is the greatest impiety in
the world. True Religion is <i>Ignis probationis</i>, which
doth <i>congregare homogenea &amp; segregare heterogenea</i>.</p>

<p>Not to tolerate things meerly indifferent to weak
consciences, argues a conscience too strong: pressed
uniformity in these, causes much disunity: To tolerate
more than indifferents, is not to deale indifferently
with God; He that doth it, takes his Scepter out
of his hand, and bids him stand by. Who hath to
doe to institute Religion but God. The power of all
Religion and Ordinances, lies in their purity: their
purity in their simplicity: then are mixtures pernicious.
I lived in a City, where a Papist preached in
one Church, a Lutheran in another, a Calvinist in a
third; a Lutheran one part of the day, a Calvinist the
other, in the same Pulpit: the Religion of that place
was but motly and meagre, their affections Leopardlike.</p>

<p>If the whole Creature should conspire to doe the<!-- Page 13 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Creator a mischiefe, or offer him an insolency, it
would be in nothing more, than in erecting untruths
against his Truth, or by sophisticating his Truths
with humane medleyes; the removing of some one
iota in Scripture, may draw out all the life, and traverse
all the Truth of the whole Bible: but to authorise
an untruth, by a Toleration of State, is to build a
Sconce against the walls of heaven, to batter God out
of his Chaire: To tell a practicall lye, is a great sin,
but yet transient; but to set up a Theoricall untruth,
is to warrant every lye that lies from its root to the
top of every branch it hath, which are not a few.</p>

<p>I would willingly hope that no Member of the
Parliament hath skilfully ingratiated himselfe into the
hearts of the House, that he might watch a time to
midwife out some ungracious Toleration for his own
turne, and for the sake of that, some others. I would
also hope that a word of generall caution should not
be particularly misapplied. I am the freer to suggest
it, because I know not one man of that mind, my
aime is generall, and I desire may be so accepted. Yet
good Gentlemen, looke well about you, and remember
how <i>Tiberius</i> plaid the Fox with the Senate of <i>Rome</i>,
and how <i>Fabius Maximus</i> cropt his ears for his cunning.</p>

<p>That State is wise, that will improve all paines and
patience rather to compose, then tolerate differences in
Religion. There is no divine Truth, but hath much
Celestial fire in it from the Spirit of Truth: nor no
irreligious untruth, without its proportion of Antifire
from the Spirit of Error to contradict it: the zeale of<!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the one, the virulency of the other, must necessarily
kindle Combustions. Fiery diseases seated in the
spirit, embroile the whole frame of the body: others
more externall and coole, are lesse dangerous. They
which divide in Religion divide in God; they who
divide in him, divide beyond <i>Genus Generalissimum</i>,
where there is no reconciliation, without atonement;
that is, without uniting in him, who is One, and in
his Truth, which is also one.</p>

<p>Wise are those men who will be perswaded rather
to live within the pale of Truth where they may bee
quiet, than in the purliev's, where they are sure to be
hunted ever and anon, doe Authority what it can.
Every singular Opinion, hath a singular opinion of it
self; and he that holds it a singular opinion of himself,
and a simple opinion of all contra-sentients: he
that confutes them, must confute all three at once, or
else he does nothing; which will not be done without
more stir than the peace of the State or Church
can indure.</p>

<p>And prudent are those Christians, that will rather
give what may be given, then hazzard all by yeelding
nothing. To sell all peace of Country, to buy some
peace of Conscience unseasonably, is more avarice
than thrift, imprudence than patience: they deale not
equally, that set any truth of God at such a rate; but
they deale wisely that will stay till the Market is fallen.</p>

<p>My prognosticks deceive me not a little, if once
within three seven years, peace prove not such a penny-worth
at most Marts in Christendome, that hee
that would not lay down his money, his lust, his opin<!-- Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>ion,
his will, I had almost said the best flower of his
Crown for it, while he might have had it; will tell
his own heart, he plaid the very ill husband.</p>

<p>Concerning Tolerations I may further assert.</p>

<p>That Persecution of True Religion, and Toleration
of false, are the <i>Jannes</i> and <i>Jambres</i> to the Kingdome
of Christ, whereof the last is farre the worst. <i>Augustines</i>
tongue had not owed his mouth one penny-rent
though it had never spake one word more in it, but
this, <i>Nullum malum pejus libertate errandi</i>.</p>

<p><i>Frederick</i> Duke of <i>Saxon</i>, spake not one foote beyond
the mark when he said, he had rather the Earth
should swallow him up quick, then he should give a
toleration to any opinion against any truth of God.</p>

<p>He that is willing to tolerate any Religion, or discrepant
way of Religion, besides his own, unlesse it
be in matters meerly indifferent, either doubts of his
own, or is not sincere in it.</p>

<p>He that is willing to tolerate any unsound Opinion,
that his own may also be tolerated, though never so
sound, will for a need hang Gods Bible at the Devils
girdle.</p>

<p>Every Toleration of false Religions, or Opinions
hath as many Errours and sins in it, as all the false
Religions and Opinions it tolerates, and one sound
one more.</p>

<p>That State that will give Liberty of Conscience in
matters of Religion, must give Liberty of Conscience
and Conversation in their Morall Laws, or else the
Fiddle will be out of tune, and some of the strings
cracke.<!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>He that will rather make an irreligious quarrell with
other Religions, then try the truth of his own by valuable
Arguments, and peaceable Sufferings; either his
Religion, or himselfe is irreligious.</p>

<p>Experience will teach Churches and Christians,
that it is farre better to live in a State united, though
a little Corrupt, then in a State, whereof some Part
is incorrupt, and all the rest divided.</p>

<p>I am not altogether ignorant of the eight Rules
given by Orthodox Divines about giving Tolerations,
yet with their favour I dare affirme,</p>

<p>That there is no Rule given by God for any State
to give an Affirmative Toleration to any false Religion,
or Opinion whatsoever; they must connive in
some cases, but may not concede in any.</p>

<p>That the State of <i>England</i> (so farre as my Intelligence
serves) might in time have prevented with ease,
and may yet without any great difficulty deny both
Toleration, and irregular Connivences, <i>salva Republica</i>.</p>

<p>That if the State of <i>England</i> shall either willingly
Tolerate, or weakly connive at such Courses, the
Church of that Kingdom will sooner become the Devills
Dancing-Schoole, then Gods-Temple; The Civill
State a Beare-garden, then an Exchange: The whole
Realme a Pais base, then an <i>England</i>. And what
pity it is, that that Country which hath been the Staple
of Truth to all Christendome, should now become
the Aviary of Errors to the whole World, let every
fearing heart judge.</p>

<p>I take Liberty of Conscience to bee nothing but a<!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
freedome from sinne, and error. <i>Conscientia in tantum
libera, in quantum ab errore liberata.</i> And liberty
of Error nothing but a Prison for Conscience.
Then small will bee the kindnesse of a State to build
such Prisons for their Subjects.</p>

<p>The Scripture saith, there is nothing makes free but
Truth, and Truth saith, there is no Truth but One:
If the States of the World would make it their sumoperous
Care to preserve this One Truth in its purity
and Authority it would ease them of all other Political
cares. I am sure Satan makes it his grand, if not
onely taske, to adulterate Truth; Falshood is his
sole Scepter, whereby he first ruffled, and ever since
ruined the World.</p>

<p>If Truth be but One, me thinks all the Opinionists
in <i>England</i> should not be all in that One Truth, some
of them I doubt are out. He that can extract an
unity out of such a disparity, or contract such a disparity
into an unity; had need be a better Artist, then
ever was <i>Drebell</i>.</p>

<p>If two Centers (as we may suppose) be in one Circle,
and lines drawn from both to all the points of the
Compasse, they will certainly crosse one another, and
probably cut through the Centers themselves.</p>

<p>There is talke of an universall Toleration, I would
talke as loud as I could against it, did I know what
more apt and reasonable Sacrifice <i>England</i> could offer
to God for his late performing all his heavenly
Truths, then an universall Toleration of all hellish Errors,
or how they shall make an universall Reformation,
but by making Christs Academy the Devils Uni<!-- Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>versity,
where any man may commence Heretique
<i>per saltum</i>; where he that is <i>filius Diabolicus</i>, or
<i>simpliciter pessimus</i>, may have his grace to goe to
hell <i>cum Publico Privilegio</i>; and carry as many after
him, as he can.</p>

<p><i>Religio docenda est, non coercenda</i> is a pretty piece
of <i>album Latinum</i> for some kinde of throats that are
willingly sore, but <i>H&aelig;resis dedocenda est non permittenda</i>,
will be found a farre better <i>Diamoron</i> for the
Gargarismes this Age wants, if timely and throughly
applyed.</p>

farre be it from me to wrong godly Independents. I truely

some of them as they deserve.<!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p></div>

<p>It is said, Though a man have light enough himselfe
to see the Truth, yet if he hath not enough to
enlighten others, he is bound to tolerate them, I will
engage my self, that all the Devills in <i>Britanie</i> shall
sell themselves to their shirts, to purchase a Lease of
this Position for three of their Lives, under the Seale
of the Parliament.</p>

<p>It is said, That Men ought to have Liberty of their
Conscience, and that it is Persecution to debarre them
of it: I can rather stand amazed then reply to this:
it is an astonishment to think that the braines of men
should be parboyl'd in such impious ignorance; Let
all the wits under the Heavens lay their heads together
and finde an Assertion worse than this (one excepted)
I will Petition to be chosen the universal Ideot of
the world.</p>

<p>It is said, That Civill Magistrates ought not to meddle
with Ecclesiasticall matters.</p>

<p>I would answer to this so well as I could, did I not
know that some Papers lately brought out of <i>New-England</i>,
are going to the Presse, wherein the Opinions
of the Elders there in a late Synod, concerning
this point are manifested, which I suppose will give
clearer satisfaction then I can.</p>

<p>The true English of all this their false Latine, is nothing
but a generall Toleration of all Opinions; which
motion if it be like to take, it were very requisite,
that the City would repaire <i>Pauls</i> with all the speed
they can, for an English <i>Pantheon</i>, and bestow it
upon the Sectaries, freely to assemble in, then there
may be some hope that <i>London</i> will be quiet in time.<!-- Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>But why dwell I so intolerable long about Tolerations,
I hope my feares are but panick, against which
I have a double cordiall. First, that the Parliament
will not though they could: Secondly, that they cannot
though they would grant such Tolerations. God
who hath so honoured them with eminent wisdome
in all other things, will not suffer them to cast both
his, and their Honour in the dust of perpetuall Infamy,
doe what they can; nor shall those who have spent
so great a part of their substance in redeeming their
Civill Liberties from Usurpation, lose all that remaines
in enthralling their spirituall Liberty by Toleration.</p>

<p>It is said Opinionists are many, and strong, that <i>de
sunt Vires</i>, that it is <i>turbata respublica</i>, I am very
sorry for it, but more sorry, if despondency of minde
shall cause the least tergiversation in Gods Worthies,
who have receiv'd such pledges of his presence in
their late Counsels, and Conflicts. It is not thousands
of Opinionists that can pinion his Everlasting armes, I
can hardly beleeve there is a greater unbeleever then
my Selfe, yet I can verily beleeve that the God of
Truth will in a short time scatter them all like smoake
before the wind. I confesse I am troubled to see Men
so over-troubled about them; I am rather glad to
heare the Devill is breaking up house in <i>England</i>, and
removing somewhither else, give him leave to sell all
his rags, and odde-ends by the out-cry; and let his
petty Chapmen make their Market while they may,
upon my poore credit it will not last long. Hee that
hath done so much for <i>England</i> will go on to perfect
his owne praise, and his Peoples Peace: let good<!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
men stand still, and behold his further Salvation. He
that sitteth in the Heavens laughs at them, the most
High hath them in Derision, and their folly shall certainly
be manifested to all men.</p>

<p>Yet I dare not but adde, and in the Name of God
will adde, that if any Publique members of Church or
State, have been either open fautors, or private abetters
of any blasphemous, contagious Opinions; It will be
their wisdome to proportion their repentance to their
Sin, before God makes them Publique monuments of
Ignominie, and Apostasie.</p>

<p>Thirdly, That all Christian States, ought to disavow
and decry all such Errours, by some peremptory
Statutary Act, and that in time, that Subjects knowing
fully the minde of the State, might not delude
themselves with vaine hopes of unsufferable Liberties.
It is lesse to say <i>Statuatur veritas, ruat Regnum</i>, than
<i>Fiat justitia, ruat C&oelig;lum</i>; but there is no such danger
in either of them. Feare nothing Gentlemen,
<i>Rubiconem transiistis, jacta est alea</i>, ye have turned
the Devill out of doores; fling all his old parrell after
him out at the windows, lest he makes an errand for
it againe. <i>Qu&aelig; relinquuntur in morbis post indicationem,
recidivas facere consuevere.</i> Christ would have
his Church without spot or wrinckle; They that help
make it so, shall lose neither honour nor labour: If
yee be wise, suffer no more thorns in his sides or your
owne. When God kindles such fires as these, hee
doth not usually quench them, till the very scum on
the pot sides be boyled cleane away, <i>Ezek. 24. 10,
<!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>11</i>. Yee were better to doe it your selves, then leave
it to him: the Arme of the Lord is mighty, his hand
very heavy; who can dwell with his devouring fire,
and long lasting burnings?</p>

<p>Fourthly, to make speedy provision against Obstinates
and disseminaries: where under favour, two
things will be found requisite. First, variety of penaltyes,
I meane certaine, not indefinite: I am a Crabbat
against Arbitrary Government. Experience hath
taught us here, that politicall, domesticall, and personall
respects, will not admit one and the same remedy
for all, without sad inconveniences. Secondly, just
severity: persecution hath ever spread Truth, prosecution
scattered Errour: Ten of the most Christian
Emperors, found that way best; Schollars know whom
I meane: Five of the ancient Fathers perswaded to it,
of whom <i>Augustine</i> was one, who for a time argued
hard for indulgency: but upon conference with other
prudent Bishops, altered his judgement, as appears in
three of his Epistles, to <i>Marcellinus</i>, <i>Donatus</i>, and
<i>Boniface</i>. I would be understood, not onely an Allower,
but an humble Petitioner, that ignorant and
tender conscienced Anabaptists may have due time
and means of conviction.</p>

<p>Fifthly, That every Prophet, to whom God hath
given the tongue of the learned, should teach, and
every Angel who hath a pen and inkehorne by his
side write against these grieving extravagancies:
writing of many books, I grant is irkesome, reading
endlesse. A reasonable man would thinke Divines
had declaimed sufficiently upon these Themes. I have
ever thought the Rule given, <i>Titus 3. 10.</i> which cuts<!-- Page 23 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the work short and sharpe to be more properly prevalent,
then wearisome waiting upon unweariable Spirits.
It is a most toylsome taske to run the wild-goose
chase after a well-breath'd Opinionist: they delight
in vitilitigation: it is an itch that loves a life to be
scrub'd: they desire not satisfaction, but satisdiction,
whereof themselves must be judges: yet in new eruptions
of Error with new objections, silence is sinfull.</p>

<p>As for my selfe, I am none of the disputers of this
world: all I can doe, is to guesse when men speake
true or false divinity: if I can but finde the parentall
roote, or formall reason of a Truth, I am quiet; if I
cannot, I shore up my slender judgement as long as
I can, with two or three the handsomest props I can
get: I shall therefore leave Arguments to acuter
heads, and onely speak a word of Love, with all
Christian respect to our deare Brethren in <i>England</i>,
which are against baptizing of Infants: I intreate them
to consider these few things seriously and meekly.
First, what a high pitch of boldnesse it is for man to
cut a principall Ordinance out of the Kingdome of God;
if it be but to make a dislocation, which so far disgoods
the Ordinance, I feare it altogether unhallows
it, to transplace or transtime a stated Institution of
Christ, without his direction, I thinke, is to destroy
it. Secondly, what a Cruelty it is to devest children
of that onely externall priviledge which their heavenly
Father hath bequeathed them, to interest them visibly
in Himselfe, His Son, His Spirit, His Covenant of
Grace, and the tender bosome of their carefull Mother
the Church. Thirdly, what an Inhumanity it is, to<!-- Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
deprive Parents of that comfort they may take from
the baptisme of their Infants dying in their Childehood.
Fourthly, How unseasonable and unkindely it is, to
interturbe the State and Church with these Amalekitish
onsets, when they are in their extreame pangs of
travell with their lives. Fifthly, to take a through
view of those who have preambled this by path.
Being sometimes in the Crowds of foraigne Wederdopers,
that is, Anabaptists; and prying into their inward
frames with the best eyes I had; I could not but observe
these disguised guises in the generality of them.</p>

<p>First, a flat formality of Spirit without salt or savour
in the spiritualties of Christ, as if their Religion
began and ended in their Opinion. Secondly, a shallow
slighting of such as dissent from them, appearing
too often in their faces, speeches and carriages. Thirdly,
a feeble, yet peremptory obstinacy; seldome are
any of them reclaimed. Fourthly, a shamefull sliding
into other such tarpauling tenets, to keep themselves
dry from the showers of Justice, as a rationall minde
would never entertain, if it were not Errour-blasted
from Heaven and Hell: I should as shrewdly suspect
that Opinion, that will cordially corrive with two or
three sottish errours, as that faith that can professedly
live with two or three sordid sins. I dare not feare
our godly Brethren in <i>England</i> to be yet comming to
this passe; how soon they may, themselves know not,
the times are slippery: They will undoubtedly finde
God as jealous of his Ordinances, as themselves are
zealous of their Opinions.</p>

<p>Sixthly, That Authority ought to see their Sub<!-- Page 25 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>jects
children baptized, though their Parents judgements
be against it, if there be no other Evangelicall
barre in the way.</p>

<p>Seventhly, That prudent men, especially young,
should doe well not to ingage themselves in conference
with Errorists, without a good calling and great caution;
their breath is contagious, their leprey spreading:
receive not him that is weak, saith the Apostle, to
doubtfull disputations; much lesse may they run
themselves into dangerous Sophistications. He usually
hears best in their meetings, that stops his eares closest;
he opens his mouth to best purpose, that keeps it
shut, and he doeth best of all, that declines their company
as wisely as he may.</p>

<p>Brethren, have an extraordinary care also of the
late Theosophers, that teach men to climbe to Heaven
upon a ladder of lying figments. Rather than the
Devill will lose his game, he will out-shoot Christ in
his owne bow; he will out-law the Law, quite out of
the word and world: over-Gospell the Gospell, and
quidanye Christ, with Sugar and Rats-bane. Hee
was Professour not long since at <i>Schelstat</i> in <i>Alsatia</i>,
where he learned that no poyson is so deadly as the
poyson of Grace.</p>

<p>The wisest way, when all is said, is with all humility
and feare, to take Christ as himselfe hath revealed
himselfe in his Gospel, and not as the Devill presents
him to prestigiated phansies. I have ever hated the
way of the Rosie-Crucians, who reject things as Gods
wisedome hath tempered them, and will have nothing
but their Spirits. If I were to give physick to Spryts,<!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
I would doe so too: but when I want physick for my
body, I would not have my soule tartared: nor my
Animall Spirits purged any way, but by my Naturall,
and those by my bodily humours, and those by such
Ordinaries, as have the nearest vicinage to them, and
not by Metaphysicall Limbeckings. I cannot thinke
that <i>materia prima</i> or <i>secunda</i>, should be good for
me, that am at least, <i>Materia millessima sexcentesima
quadragesima quinta</i>.</p>

<p>Here I hold my selfe bound to set up a Beacon, to
give warning of a new-sprung Sect of Phrantasticks,
which would perswade themselves and others, that
they have discovered the Nor-west passage to Heaven.
These wits of the game, cry up and downe in
corners such bold ignotions of a new Gospell, new
Christ, new Faith, and new gay-nothings, as trouble
unsetled heads, querulous hearts, and not a little
grieve the Spirit of God. I desire all good men may
be saved from their Lunatick Creed, by Infidelity; and
rather beleeve these torrid overtures will prove in
time, nothing but horrid raptures downe to the lowest
hell, from which he that would be delivered, let him
avoid these blasphemers, a late fry of croaking Frogs,
not to be indured in a Religious State, no, if it were
possible, not an houre.</p>

<p>As some are playing young Spaniels, questing at
every bird that rises; so others, held very good men,
are at a dead stand, not knowing what to doe or say;
and are therefore called Seekers, looking for new
Nuntio's from Christ, to assoile these benighted questions,
and to give new Orders for new Churches. I<!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
crave leave with all respect to tell them, that if they
looke into <i>Act. 20. 20. 25.</i> <i>Gal. 1. 8. 9.</i> <i>1. Tim. 6.
13. 16.</i> and find them not there; they may happily
seeke as the young Prophets did for Eliah's corps,
where it never was, nor ever will be found.</p>

<p>I cannot imagine why the Holy Ghost should give
<i>Timothy</i> the solemnest charge, was ever given mortall
man, to observe the Rules he had given, till the
comming of Christ, if new things must be expected.</p>

<p>Woe be to them, who ever they be, that so trouble
the wayes of God that they who have found the way
to Heaven, cannot find the way to Church: And woe
be to them, that so gaze at the glorious light, they say,
will breake forth in the thousand yeares to come, that
they make little of the gracious Truth that hath been
revealed these sixteen hundred years past. And woe
be to them that so under-value the first Master-Builders,
I mean the Apostles of Christ, that unlesse he
sends wiser than they, He must be accounted lesse
faithfull in his house than <i>Moses</i> was.</p>

<p>I have cause enough to be as charitable to others
as any man living; yet I cannot but feare, that those
men never Moored their Anchors well in the firme
soile of Heaven, that are weather-waft up and down
with every eddy-wind of every new doctrine. The
good Spirit of God doth not usually tie up the Helme,
and suffer passengers to Heaven to ride a drift, hither
and thither, as every wave and current carries them:
that is a fitter course for such as the Apostle calls
wandring Starres and Meteors, without any certaine
motion, hurryed about with tempests, bred of the Ex<!-- Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>halations
of their own pride and self-wittednesse:
whose damnation sleepeth not, and to whom the mist
of darknesse is reserved for ever, that they may suffer
irreparable shipwrack upon the Sands and Rocks
of their owne Errours, being of old ordained to condemnation.</p>

<p>Eightly, let all considerate men beware of ungrounded
opinions in Religion: Since I knew what to feare,
my timerous heart hath dreaded three things: a blazing
starre appearing in the aire: a State Comet, I
mean a favourite rising in a Kingdome, a new Opinion
spreading in Religion: these are Exorbitancies:
which is a formidable word: a <i>vacuum</i> and an exorbitancy,
are mundicidious evils. Concerning Novelties
of opinions; I shall expresse my thoughts in these
briefe passages. First, that Truth is the best boone
God ever gave the world: there is nothing in the
world, any further then Truth makes it so; it
is better then any creat' <i>Ens</i> or <i>Bonum</i>, which are but
Truths twins. Secondly, the least Truth of Gods
Kingdome, doth in its place, uphold the whole kingdome
of his Truths; Take away the least <i>vericulum</i>
out of the world, and it unworlds all, potentially, and
may unravell the whole texture actually, if it be not
conserved by an Arme of superiordinary power. Thirdly,
the least Evangelicall Truth is more worth than
all the Civil Truths in the world, that are meerly so.
Fourthly, that Truth is the Parent of all Liberty
whether politicall or personall; so much untruth, so
much thraldome, <i>John 8. 32</i>.</p>

<p>Hence it is, that God is so jealous of his Truths, that<!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
he hath taken order in his due justice: First, that no
practicall sin is so sinfull as some errour in judgement;
no men so accursed with indelible infamie and dedolent
impenitency, as Authours of Heresie. Secondly,
that the least Error, if grown sturdy and pressed,
shall set open the Spittle-doore of all the squint ey'd,
wry-necked, and brazen-faced Errors that are or ever
were of that litter; if they be not enough to serve its
turne, it will beget more, though it hath not one crust
of reason to maintain them. Thirdly, that that State
which will permit Errors in Religion, shall admit Errors
in policy unavoyably. Fourthly, that that Policy
which will suffer irreligious Errors, shall suffer the
losse of so much Liberty in one kind or other, I will
not exempt <i>Venice</i>, <i>Rhaguse</i>, the <i>Cantons</i>, the <i>Nether-lands</i>,
or any.</p>

<p>An easie head may soon demonstrate, that the pre-mentioned
Planters, by Tolerating all Religions, had
immazed themselves in the most intolerable confusions
and inextricable thraldomes the world ever heard
of. I am perswaded the Devill himselfe was never
willing with their proceedings, for feare it would
breake his wind and wits to attend such a Province.
I speak it seriously according to my meaning. How
all Religions should enjoy their Liberty, Justice its
due regularity, Civill cohabitation morall honesty, in
one and the same Jurisdiction, is beyond the Artique
of my comprehension. If the whole conclave of Hell
can so compromise, exadverse, and diametricall contradictions,
as to compolitize such a multimonstrous
maufrey of heteroclytes and quicquidlibets quietly;<!-- Page 30 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
I trust I may say with all humble reverence, they can
doe more then the Senate of Heaven. My <i>modus loquendi</i>
pardoned: I intirely wish much welfare and
more wisdom to that Plantation.</p>

<p>It is greatly to be lamented, to observe the wanton
fearlessnesse of this Age, especially of younger professors,
to greet new opinions and Opinionists: as if
former truths were grown superannuate, and saplesse,
if not altogether antiquate. <i>Non senescet veritas.</i> No
man ever saw a gray haire on the head or beard of any
Truth, wrinckle, or morphew on its face: The bed
of Truth is green all the yeare long. Hee that cannot
solace himselfe with any saving truth, as affectionately
as at the first acquaintance with it, hath not only
a fastidious, but an adulterous heart.</p>

<p>If all be true we heare, Never was any People under
the Sun, so sick of new Opinions as <i>English-men</i>
nor of new fashions as <i>English-women</i>: If God helpe
not the one, and the devill leave not helping the other,
a blind man may easily foresee what will become
of both. I have spoken what I intend for the present
to men; I shall speak a word to the women anon:
in the mean time I intreat them to prepare patience.</p>

<p>Ninthly, that godly humble Christians ought not
to wonder impatiently at the wonderfull workes of
God in these times: it is full Season for him to work
Soveraign worke, to vindicate his Soveraignty, that
men may feare before him. States are unstated, Rulers
growne Over-rulers, Subjects worse then men,
Churches decayed. Tofts, Professors, empty casks
filled with unholy humours; I speake not of all, but<!-- Page 31 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
too many; I condemne not the generation of the just:
God hath his remnant, whom he will carefully preserve.
If it bee time for men to take up Defensive
Armes against such as are called Gods, upon the point
of <i>Salus populi</i>, it is high time for him that is God
indeed, to draw his Sword against wormes and no
men, upon the point of <i>Majestas imperii</i>: The piercing
of his Sword shall discover the thoughts of many
hearts.</p>

<p>Lastly, I dare averre, that it ill becomes Christians
any thing well-shod with the preparation of the Gospel,
to meditate flight from their deare Countrey upon
these disturbances. Stand your ground ye <i>Eleazars</i>
and <i>Shammahs</i>, stir not a foot so long as you have
halfe a foot of ground to stand upon: after one or
two such Worthies, a great Victory may be regained,
and flying <i>Israel</i> may returne to a rich spoile.
<i>Englishmen</i>, be advised to love <i>England</i>, with your
hearts and to preserve it by your Prayers. I am bold
to say that since the pure Primitive time, the Gospel
never thrived so well in any soile on earth, as in the
<i>British</i>; nor is the like goodnesse of nature, or Cornucopian
plenty else-where to be found: if ye lose
that Country, and finde a better before ye come to
Heaven, my Cosmography fades me. I am farre
from discouraging any, whom necessity of Conscience
or condition thrusts out by head and shoulders:
if God calls any into a Wildernesse, Hee will be no
wildernesse to them, <i>Jer. 2. 31.</i> witnesse his large beneficence
to us here beyond expectation.<!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>Ye say, why come not we over to help the Lord
against the Mighty, in these Sacred battailes?</p>

<p>I answer, many here are diligently observing the
counsell of the same Prophet, 22. 10. <i>Weepe not for
him that is dead, neither bemoan him; but weep for
him that is gone away and shall returne no more to
see his Native Country.</i> Divers make it an Article
of our <i>American</i> Creed, which a celebrate Divine of
<i>England</i> hath observed upon <i>Heb. 11. 9.</i> That no
man ought to forsake his owne countrey, but upon extraordinary
cause, and when that cause ceaseth, he is
bound in conscience to returne if he can: We are looking
to him who hath our hopes and seasons in his
onely wise hand.</p>

<p>In the mean time we desire to bow our knees before
the Throne of Grace day and night, that the Lord
would be pleased in his tender mercy to still the sad
unquietnesse and per-peracute contentions, of that
most comfortable and renowned island, that at length
He may have praise in his Churches, and his Churches
peace in him, through Jesus Christ.</p>

<hr />

<p>Should I not keepe promise in speaking a little
to Womens fashions, they would take it unkindly:
I was loath to pester better matter with such
stuffe; I rather thought it meet to let them stand by
themselves, like the <i>Qu&aelig; Genus</i> in the Grammar,
being Deficients, or Redundants, not to be brought
under any Rule: I shall therefore make bold for this
once, to borrow a little of their loose tongued Liberty,
and mispend a word or two upon their long-wast<!-- Page 33 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>ed,
but short-skirted patience: a little use of my

<p>It is known more then enough, that I am neither
Nigard, nor Cinick, to the due bravery of the true
Gentry: if any man mislikes a bully mong drossock
more then I, let him take her for his labour: I honour
the woman that can honour her selfe with her attire:
a good Text alwayes deserves a fair Margent: I am
not much offended if I see a trimme, far trimmer than
she that wears it: in a word, whatever Christianity or
Civility will allow, I can afford with <i>London</i> measure:
but when I heare a nugiperous Gentledame inquire
what dresse the Queen is in this week: what the
nudiustertian fashion of the Court; I meane the very
newest: with egge to be in it in all haste, what ever
it be; I look at her as the very gizzard of a trifle, the
product of a quarter of a cypher, the epitome of nothing,
fitter to be kickt, if shee were of a kickable substance,
than either honour'd or humour'd.</p>

<p>To speak moderately, I truly confesse, it is beyond
the ken of my understanding to conceive, how
those women should have any true grace, or valuable
vertue, that have so little wit, as to disfigure
themselves with such exotick garbes, as not only dismantles
their native lovely lustre, but transclouts<!-- Page 34 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
them into gant bar-geese, ill-shapen-shotten-shell-fish,
Egyptian Hyeroglyphicks, or at the best into French
flurts of the pastery, which a proper English woman
should scorne with her heels: it is no marvell they
weare drailes on the hinder part of their heads, having
nothing as it seems in the fore-part, but a few
Squirrils brains to help them frisk from ill-favor'd
fashion to another.</p>

<p>The very troublers and impoverishers of mankind,

<p>The Verses are even enough for such odde pegma's.
I can make my selfe sicke at any time, with
comparing the dazling splender wherewith our Gentlewomen
were embellished in some former habits,
with the gut-foundred goosdom, wherewith they are
now surcingled and debauched. Wee have about five
or six of them in our Colony: if I see any of them
accidentally, I cannot cleanse my phansie of them for
a moneth after. I have been a solitary widdower almost
twelve yeares, purposed lately to make a step
over to my Native Country for a yoke-fellow: but<!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
when I consider how women there have tripe-wifed
themselves with their cladments, I have no heart to
the voyage, least their nauseous shapes and the Sea,
should work too sorely upon my stomach. I speak sadly;
me thinkes it should breake the hearts of English-men
to see so many goodly English-women imprisoned
in French Cages, peering out of their hood-holes
for some men of mercy to help them with a little
wit, and no body relieves them.</p>

<p>It is a more common then convenient saying, that
nine Taylors make a man: it were well if nineteene
could make a woman to her minde: if Taylors were
men indeed, well furnished but with meer morall
principles, they would disdain to be led about like
Apes, by such mymick Marmosets. It is a most unworthy
thing, for men that have bones in them, to
spend their lives in making fidle-cases for futilous
womens phansies; which are the very pettitoes of infirmity,
the gyblets of perquisquilian toyes. I am so
charitable to think, that most of that mystery would
worke the cheerfuller while they live, if they might
bee well discharged of the tyring slavery of mis-tyring
women: it is no little labour to be continually putting
up English-women into Out-landish caskes: who
if they be not shifted anew, once in a few moneths,
grow too sowre for their Husbands. What this Trade
will answer for themselves when God shall take measure
of Taylors consciences is beyond my skill to
imagine. There was a time when</p>

that makes for women, as often, to keepe them from

<p>I have often heard divers Ladies vent loud feminine
complaints of the wearisome varieties and chargable
changes of fashions: I marvell themselves preferre
not a Bill of redresse. I would<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> <i>Essex</i> Ladies
would lead the <i>Chore</i>, for the honour of their County
and persons; or rather the thrice honourable Ladies
of the Court, whom it best beseemes: who may wel
presume of a <i>Le Roy le veult</i> from our sober King, a
<i>Les Seigneurs ont Assentus</i> from our prudent Peers,
and the like <i>Assentus</i> from our considerate, I dare not
say wife-worne Commons: who I beleeve had much
rather passe one such Bill, than pay so many Taylors
Bills as they are forced to doe.</p>

since the Conquest, but Essex, which is onely free, and should be
thankfull.</p></div>

<p>Most deare and unparallel'd Ladies, be pleased to
attempt it: as you have the precellency of the women
of the world for beauty and feature; so assume the
honour to give, and not take Law from any, in matter
of attire: if ye can transact so faire a motion among
yourselves unanimously, I dare say, they that most
renite, will least repent. What greater honour can<!-- Page 37 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
your Honors desire, then to build a Promontory president
to all foraigne Ladies, to deserve so eminently at
the hands of all the English Gentry present and to
come: and to confute the opinion of all the wise men
in the world; who never thought it possible for women
to doe so good a work?</p>

<p>If any man think I have spoken rather merrily
than seriously he is much mistaken, I have written
what I write with all the indignation I can, and no
more then I ought. I confesse I veer'd my tongue to
this kinde of Language <i>de industria</i> though unwillingly,
supposing those I speak to are uncapable of
grave and rationall arguments.</p>

<p>I desire all Ladies and Gentlewomen to understand
that all this while I intend not such as through necessary
modesty to avoyd morose singularity, follow
fashions slowly, a flight shot or two off, shewing by
their moderation, that they rather draw countermont
with their hearts, then put on by their examples.</p>

<p>I point my pen only against the light-heel'd beagles
that lead the chase so fast, that they run all civility
out of breath, against these Ape-headed pullets,
which invent Antique foole-fangles, meerly for fashion
and novelty sake.</p>

<p>In a word, if I begin once to declaime against fashions,
let men and women look well about them, there
is somewhat in the businesse; I confesse to the world,
I never had grace enough to be strict in that kinde;
and of late years, I have found syrrope of pride very
wholesome in a due <i>Dos</i>, which makes mee keep such
store of that drugge by me, that if any body comes<!-- Page 38 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
to me for a question-full or two about fashions, they
never complain of me for giving them hard measure,
or under-weight.</p>

<p>But I addresse my self to those who can both hear
and mend all if they please: I seriously feare, if the
pious Parliament doe not finde a time to state fashions,
as ancient Parliaments have done in some part,
God will hardly finde a time to state Religion or
Peace: They are the surquedryes of pride, the wantonnesse
of idlenesse, provoking sins, the certain prodromies
of assured judgement, <i>Zeph. 1. 7, 8</i>.</p>

<p>It is beyond all account, how many Gentlemens
and Citizens estates are deplumed by their feather-headed
wives, what usefull supplies the pannage of
<i>England</i> would afford other Countries, what rich returnes
to it selfe, if it were not slic'd out into male
and female fripperies: and what a multitude of misimploy'd
hands, might be better improv'd in some more
manly Manufactures for the publique weale: it is not
easily credible, what may be said of the preterpluralities
of Taylors in <i>London</i>: I have heard an honest
man say, that not long since there were numbered between
<i>Temple-barre</i> and <i>Charing-Crosse</i>, eight thousand
of that Trade: let it be conjectured by that
proportion how many there are in and about <i>London</i>,
and in all <i>England</i>, they will appeare to be very
numerous. If the Parliament would please to mend
women, which their Husbands dare not doe, there
need not so many men to make and mend as there
are. I hope the present dolefull estate of the Realme,
will perswade more strongly to some considerate
course herein, than I now can.<!-- Page 39 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>Knew I how to bring it in, I would speak a word
to long haire, whereof I will say no more but this:
if God proves not such a Barbor to it as he threatens,
unlesse it be amended, <i>Esa. 7. 20.</i> before the Peace of
the State and Church be well setled, then let my
prophesie be scorned, as a sound minde scornes the
ryot of that sin, and more it needs not. If those who
are tearmed Rattle-heads and Impuritans, would take
up a Resolution to begin in moderation of haire, to
the just reproach of those that are called Puritans and
Round-heads, I would honour their manlinesse, as
much as the others godlinesse, so long as I knew what
man or honour meant: if neither can find a Barbours
shop, let them turne in, to <i>Psal. 68. 21.</i> <i>Jer. 7. 29.</i>
<i>1 Cor. 11. 14.</i> if it be thought no wisdome in men
to distinguish themselves in the field by the Scissers,
let it bee thought no injustice in God, not to distinguish
them by the Sword. I had rather God should
know me by my sobriety, than mine enemy not know
me by my vanity. He is ill kept, that is kept by his
owne sin. A short promise is a farre safer guard than a
long lock: it is an ill distinction which God is loth to
looke at, and his Angels cannot know his Saints by.
Though it be not the mark of the Beast, yet it may be
the mark of a beast prepared to slaughter. I am sure
men use not to weare such manes; I am also sure
Souldiers use to weare other marklets or notadoes in
time of battell.</p>

the best peece of Soule-leather I have, did I not feare
I should break my All, which though it may be a

I should esteeme it the best piece of workmanship my
Cobling hand every wrought, if it would please Him
whose worke it is, to direct me to speake such a word

<p>I would not be so unwise as to grieve the wise, if
I were wise enough to foresee it: I would speake
nothing to the Cause or Continuance of these wearisome
Warres hitherto; the one is enough debated, the
other more than enough peracted. Nor would I declaime
of the uncomlinesse, unbrotherlinesse, unseasonablenesse
and unreasonablenesse of these direfull
digladiations: every stroak strucke sounds too loud
upon this harsh string. I would much rather speake
perswasives to a comely brotherly seasonable and
reasonable cessation of Armes on both sides, by a
drawn battaile: Wherein if I shall adventure a few
over-bold words, I intreat my ignorance, impartiality,
and Loyalty may plead pardon for me.</p>

<p>Foure meanes there are, and no more, within the
compasse of my consideration, conducing to what is
desired. Either to get the Standard fixed in heaven
by the Lord of Hosts taken downe, I meane by Re<!-- Page 41 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>formation:
Or to set up white colours instead of red,
on one side or other, I meane by Composition: Or
by furling up all the Ensignes on both sides, I meane
by mutuall and generall Cessation: Or by still displaying
all the Colours and Cornets of every batallion,
I mean by prosecution: without Reformation
there will hardly be any Composition; without Composition
little hope of Cessation; without Cessation
there must and will be Prosecution; which God forbid.</p>


<h3><i>Reformation.</i></h3>

<p>When the Roman Standard was defixed with
such difficulty at the battell between <i>Hanniball</i>
and <i>Flaminius</i> at <i>Thrasimene</i>, it proved an ill
Omen. <i>When God gives quietnesse, who can make
trouble; when he hideth his face, who can behold him?</i>
Whether it be against a nation or a man onely.
<i>That the Hypocrite reigne not, lest the people be insnared,</i>
<i>Job 34. 29, 30</i>. How can the sword of the
Lord put it selfe up into its scabbard and be quiet,
when himself hath given it a charge to the contrary?
<i>Jer. 47. 6, 7</i>. It was a Cardinall Truth which Cardinall
<i>Poole</i> spake to H. 8. <i>Penes Reges est inferre bellum,
penes autem Deum terminare.</i> If Kings will make
their beginnings, God will make his ends: much more
when himselfe begins: <i>When I begin I will also
make an end</i>, <i>1 Sam. 3. 12</i>. Farre better were it, for
men to make an end with him in time, than put him
to make such an end with them as he there intends.</p>

<p>Politicall Reformation he seemes to call for now
<i>indigitanter</i>. When he beholds Christian Kingdomes<!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
and States unsound in their foundations, illineall in
their superstructures, unjust in their administrations;
he kicks them in peeces with the foot of his Indignation:
But when Religious Statesmen frame and build
by the levell and plummet of his wisdome, then people
may say as his servants of old, <i>Looke upon Zion
the City of our Solemnities; Your eyes shall see it a
quiet habitation, a Tabernacle that shall not be taken
down; not one of the stakes thereof shall be removed,
neither shall any of the coards thereof bee broken</i>;
<i>Isa. 33. 20.</i> neither by civill Commotions nor foraign
Invasions. When the coards of a State are exquisitely
tight, and the stakes firmely pitched; such a Tent
though but a Tent shall not easily flutter or fall:
But <i>if the Tacklings be so loose, that the maine Mast
cannot stand steady, nor the Saile be well spread;
then may the lame take and divide a great prey</i>, ver.
23. If Religion, Laws, Liberties, Affections, Conversations,
and foraigne Federacies be slight; the strength
of strong men shall be weaknesse, and the weaknesse
of the weak victorious.</p>

<p><i>Pura politeja ne unum admittit sol&aelig;cismulum, neque
valet, pr&aelig;scriptio in politicis aut moralibus.</i> It may
maintain a bright conjecture, against a rusty Truth: a
legible possession, against an obliterate Claime: an
inconvenience, against a convenience; where no cleare
remedy may be had: but never any thing that is formally
sinfull, or materially mischievous. When rotten
States are soundly mended from head to foot,
proportions duly admeasured, Justice justly dispenced;
then shall Rulers and Subjects have peace with God<!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
and themselves: but till then, the gayest Kingdomes
shall be but ruffling scuffling, removing and commoving
hovells. For <i>England</i>, however the upper Stories
are shroadly shattered; yet the foundations and
frame being good or mendable by the Architectors
now at worke, there is good hope, when peace is setled,
people shall dwell more wind-tight and water-tight
than formerly. I earnestly wish our Mr. Builders
to remember, that punctuality in Divinity and
Politie, is but regularity; that what is amisse in the
mould, will misfashion the prosult: and that if this
market be slipt, things may grow as deare as ever
they were. Most expert Gentlemen, bee intreated at
length to set our Head right on our shoulders, that we
may once look upwards and goe forwards like proper
Englishmen.</p>

<hr />

<p>God will also have Ecclesiasticall Reformation now,
or nothing: And here he stands not upon Kings,
Parliaments or Assemblies, but upon his own Termes.
I feare hee will have all drosse and base metalls
throughly melted away by these combustions, before
Hee quenches them; all his Ordinances and vessells
cast into his owne fashion, in his own mould, to his
own <i>amussim</i>, before he restores peace. There was
not a stone left upon a stone of the old Temple, before
the new was erected. If this first worke bee
throughly and throughoutly dispatched as I hope it is,
the great <i>Remora</i> is removed. If the Parliament and
Assembly be pleased to be as curious and industrious
as I have seen a great Popish Bishop in execcrating<!-- Page 44 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
a Protestant Parish Church one day, and consecrating
it the next; they may adjourn awhile with leave
enough.</p>

<p>Some ten or twelve years before these Wars there
came to my view these two Predictions.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. <i>When God shall purge this Land with soap and nitre,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Woe be to the Crowne, woe be to the Mitre.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
The accent of the blow shall fall there.<br />
</p>

<p>He that pities not the Crowne, pities not his owne
soule. Hee that pities not those that wore the Mitre,
more than they pitied themselves, or the Churches
over which they insulted, or the State then corrupted
and now Corruined by their pride and negligence,
is to blame.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">2. <i>There is a set of Bishops comming next behind,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Will ride the devill off his legs, and break his wind.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Poore men! they might have kept his backe till this
time for ought I know, had they not put him beyond
his pace: but Schollers must gallop, though they
tumble for it. Yet I commend them for this, they
gave him such straynes as made him blow short ever
since. I doubt the Assembly troubles him; and I
doubt he troubles them. Well, the Bishops are gone:
If they have carried away with them all that was in
the pockets of their Holliday hose, fare them well;
let them come againe when I give them a new <i>Conge
d' slier</i>, or send a Pursuivant for them; which if I
doe, I shall never trust myselfe more, though they<!-- Page 45 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
have often done it for me, who never deserved that
honour. Some of them I confesse were very honest
men, and would have been honester if they dared for
their fellows.</p>

<p>The sad worke now, is to institute better things in
their Roome, and to induct better men in their roome;
rather where, and how to finde those things, they having
cunningy laid them so farre out of the way; I
doubt some good men cannot see them, when they
look full upon them: it is like, the Bishops carryed
away their eyes with them, but I feare they left their
Spectacles behind them. I use no spectacles, yet my
eyes are not fine enough, nor my hand steady enough
to cut by such fine threads as are now spun. I am I
know not what; I cannot tell what to make of my
selfe, nor I think no body else: My Trade is to finde
more faults than others will mend; and I am very
diligent at it; yet it scarce findes me a living, though
the Country findes me more worke than I can turne
my hand to.</p>

<p>For Church work, I am neither Presbyterian, nor
plebsbyterian, but an Interpendent: My task is to sit
and study how shapeable the Independent way will
be to the body of <i>England</i>, then my head akes on
one side; and how suitable the Presbyterian way, as
we heare it propounded, will bee to the minde of Christ,
then my head akes on the other side: but when I consider
how the Parliament will commoderate a way
out of both, then my head leaves aking: I am not,
without some contrivalls in my patching braines; but
I had rather suppose them to powder, than expose<!-- Page 46 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
them to preregular, much lesse to preter-regular Judgements:
I shall therefore rejoyce that the work is faln
into so good hands, heads, and hearts, who will weigh
Rules by Troyweight, and not by the old Haber-du-pois:
and rather then meddle where I have so little
skill, I will sit by and tell my feares to them that have
the patience to heare them, and leave the red-hot
question to them that dare handle it.</p>

<p>I fear many holy men have not so deeply humbled
themselves for their former mis-worshippings of God
as he will have them before he reveales his secrets to
them: as they accounted things indifferent, so they
account indifferent repentance will serve turne. <i>Son
of man, if my people be ashamed of all that they have
done, then shew them the forme of the house, and the
fashion thereof</i>, else not, <i>Ezek. 43. 11</i>. A sin in Gods
worship, that seemes small in the common beame of
the world, may be very great in the scales of his Sanctuary.
Where God is very jealous, his servants should
be very cautelous.</p>

<p>I feare, the furnace wherein our new formes are casting,
is over-heat, and casts smoake in the eyes of our
founders, that they cannot well see what they doe, or
ought to doe; <i>Omne perit judicium cum res transit
in affectum.</i> Truth and peace are the <i>Castor</i> and <i>Pollux</i>
of the Gospell: they that seek the one without
the other, are like to finde neither: Anger will hinder
domestick Prayers, much more Ecclesiastique Councels.
What is produced by tumult, is either deficient
or redundant. When the judgements of good men
concurre with a harmonious Diapason, the result is me<!-- Page 47 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>lodious
and commodious. Warring and jarring men
are no builders of houses for God, though otherwise
very good. Instruments may be well made and well
strung, but if they be not well fretted, the Musique
is marred. The great Turke hearing Musitians so
long a tuning, he thought it stood not with his state
to wait for what would follow. When Christ whips
Market-makers out of his Temple, he raises dust: but
when he enters in with Truth and Holinesse, he calls
for deep silence, <i>Hab. 2. 20</i>. There must not a toole
be heard when the Tabernacle is reared: Nor is that
amiable or serviceable to men that passeth through so
many ill animadversions of Auditors and Spectators.
If the Assembly can hardly agree what to determine,
people will not easily agree what to accept.</p>

<p>I fear, these differences and delayes have occasioned
men to make more new discoveries then otherwise
they would. If publique Assemblies of Divines cannot
agree upon a right way, private Conventicles of
illiterate men, will soon find a wrong. Bivious demurres
breed devious resolutions. Passengers to heaven
are in haste, and will walk one way or other. He
that doubts of his way, thinkes hee loses his day: and
when men are gone awhile, they will be loth to turn
back. If God hide his path, Satan is at hand to turn
Convoy: If any have a minde to ride poste, he will
helpe them with a fresh spavin'd Opinion at every
Stage.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Where clocks will stand, and Dials have no light,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>There men must goe by guesse, be't wrong or right.</i><br /></span>
<!-- Page 48 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></div></div>

<p>I feare, if the Assembly of all Divines, doe not consent,
and concenter the sooner, God will breath a spirit
of wisedome and meeknesse, into the Parliament of
no Divines, to whom the Imperative and Coactive
power supremely belongs, to consult such a contemperate
way, as shall best please him, and profit his
Churches, so that it shall be written upon the doore
of the Assembly; <i>The Lord was not there.</i></p>

<p>I feare, the importunity of some impatient, and subtlety
of some malevolent mindes, will put both Parliament
and Assembly upon some preproperations,
that will not be safe in Ecclesiasticall Constitutions.
To procrastinate in matters clear, as I said even now,
may be dangerous; so, not to deliberate in dubious
cases, will be as perilous. We here, though I think
under favour, wee have some as able Steersmen as
<i>England</i> affords, have been driven to tack about
again to some other points of Christs Compasse, and
to make better observations before we hoyse up sayles.
It will be found great wisdome in disputable cases, not
to walk on by twylight, but very cautelously; rather
by probationers for a time, then peremptory positives:
Reelings and wheelings in Church acts, are both difficult
and disadvantageous. It is rather Christian
modesty than shame, in the dawning of Reformation,
to be very perpensive. Christs mind is, that Evangelicall
policies, should be framed by Angelicall measures;
not by a line of flaxe, but by a golden Reed,
<i>Rev. 21. 15</i>.</p>

<p>I feare, he that sayes, the Presbyterian and Independent
way, if rightly carryed, doe not meet in one,<!-- Page 49 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
he doth not handle his Compasses so considerately as
he should.</p>

<p>I feare, if Authority doth not establish a sutable
and peaceable Government of Churches the sooner,
the bells in all the steeples will ring awke so long,
that they will hardly be brought into tune any more.</p>

<p>My last, but not least feare, is, That God will hardly
replant his Gospel in any part of Christendome, in
so faire an Edition as is expected, till the whole field
hath been so ploughed and harrowed, that the soile
be throughly cleansed and fitted for new seed: Or
whether he will not transplant it into some other Regions,
I know not: This feare I have feared these 20
years, but upon what grounds I had rather bury than
broach.</p>

<p>I dare not but adde to what preceded about Church-Reformation,
a most humble petition, that the Authority
of the Ministry be kept in its due altitude:
if it be dropp'd in the dust, it will soon bee stifled:
Encroachments on both sides, have bred detriments
enough to the whole. The Separatists are content
their teaching Elders should sit highest on the Bench,
so they may sit in the Chaire over-against them; and
that their ruling Elders shall ride on the saddle, so
they may hold the bridle. That they may likewise
have seasonable and honorable maintenance, and that
certainly stated: which generally we find and practise
here as the best way. When Elders live upon
peoples good wills, people care little for their ill
wills, be they never so just: Voluntary contributions
or non-tributions of Members, put Ministers upon<!-- Page 50 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
many temptations in administrations of their Offices:
two houres care does more dis-spirit an ingenuous
man than two dayes study: nor can an Elder be given
to hospitality, when he knowes not what will be
given him to defray it: it is pity men of gifts should
live upon men's gifts. I have seen most of the Reformed
Churches in Europ, and seene more misery
in these two respects, then it is meet others should
hear: the complaints of painfull <i>Pareus</i>, <i>David Pareus</i>,
to my selfe, with tears, concerning the Germane
Churches, are not to be related.</p>

<p>There is yet a personall Reformation, as requisite as
the Politicall. When States are so reformed, that
they conforme such as are profligate, into good civility:
civill men, into religious morality: When Churches
are so constituted, that Faith is ordained Pastor,
Truth Teacher, Holinesse and Righteousnesse ruling
Elders: Wisedome and Charity Deacons: Knowledge,
love, hope, zeale, heavenly-mindednesse, meeknesse,
patience, watchfulnesse, humility, diligence,
sobriety, modesty, chastity, constancy, prudence, contentation,
innocency, sincerity, &amp;c. admitted members
and all their opposites excluded: then there will
bee peace of Country and Conscience.</p>

<p>Did the servants of Christ know what it is to live
in Reformed Churches with unreformed spirits, under
strict order with loose hearts, how formes of Religion
breed but formes of Godlinesse, how men by Church-discipline,
learne their Church-postures, and there
rest; they would pray as hard for purity of heart,
as purity of Ordinances. If we mocke God in these,<!-- Page 51 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
He will mocke us; either with defeat of our hopes;
or which is worse: when we have what we so much
desire, we shall be so much the worse for it. It was
a well salted speech, uttered by an English Christian
of a Reformed Church in the Netherlands, Wee have
the good Orders here, but you have the good Christians
in <i>England</i>. Hee that prizes not Old <i>England</i>
Graces, as much as New <i>England</i> Ordinances,
had need goe to some other market before hee comes
hither. In a word, hee that is not Pastor, Teacher,
Ruler, Deacon and Brother to himselfe, and lookes
not at Christ above all, it matters not a farthing whether
he be Presbyterian or Independent: he may be a
zealot in bearing witnesse to which he likes best, and
yet an Iscariot to both, in the witnesse of his owne
Conscience.</p>

<p>I have upon strict observation, seen so much power
of godlinesse, and spirituall mindednesse in English
Christians, living meerly upon Sermons and private
duties, hardly come by, when the Gospell was little
more than symptomaticall to the State; such Epidemicall
and lethall formality in other disciplinated
Churches, that I professe in the hearing of God, my
heart hath mourned, and mine eyes wept in secret, to
consider what will become of multitudes of my deare
Country-men, when they shall enjoy what they now
covet: Not that good Ordinances breed ill Consciences,
but ill Consciences grow stark nought under
good Ordinances; insomuch that might I wish an
hypocrite the most perilous place but Hell, I should
wish him a Membership in a strict Reformed Church:<!-- Page 52 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
and might I wish a sincere Servant of God, the greatest
griefe earth can afford, I should wish him to live
with a pure heart, in a Church impurely Reformed;
yet through the improvement of Gods Spirit, that
griefe may sanctifie him for Gods service and presence,
as much as the meanes he would have, but
cannot.</p>

<p>I speak this the rather to prevent, what in me lyes,
the imprudent romaging that is like to be in <i>England</i>,
from Villages to Townes, from Townes to Cities, for
Churches sake, to the undoing of Societies, Friendships,
Kindreds, Families, Heritages, Callings, yea,
the wise Providence of God in disposing mens habitations,
now in the very Infancy of Reformation: by
forgetting that a little leaven may season a large lump:
and it is much better to doe good than receive. It
were a most uncharitable and unserviceable part, for
good men to desert their own Congregations, where
many may glorifie God in the day of his Visitation,
for their presence and assistance. If a Christian would
picke out a way to thrive in grace, let him study to
administer grace to them that want: or to make sure
a blessing upon his Family; let him labour to multiply
the family of Christ, and beleeve, that he which
soweth liberally, shall reap abundantly; and hee that
spareth more than is need, from them that have more
need, shall surely come to poverty: yea, let me say,
that he who forsakes the meanes of grace for Christ
and his Churches sake, shall meet with a better bargaine,
namely, grace it selfe. It is a time now, when
full flocks should rather scatter to leane Churches,<!-- Page 53 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
than gather from other places, to make themselves
fat; when able Christians should rather turne Jesuites
and Seminaries, than run into Covents and Frieries:
had this beene the course in the Primitive time, the
Gospel had been pinfolded up in a few Cities, and not
spread as it is.</p>

<p>What more ungodly sacriledge or manstealing can
there be, then to purloin from godly Ministers the first
born of their fervent prayers and faithfull preachings,
the leven of their flocks, the incouragement of their
soules, the Crowne of their labours, their Epistle to
Heaven? I am glad to heare our <i>New-England</i> Elders
generally detest it <i>despuenter</i>, and looke at it as a
killing <i>Cordolium</i>: If men will needs gather Churches
out of the world (as they say) let them first plough
the world, sow it, and reap it with their own hands,
and the Lord give them a liberall Harvest. He is a
very hard man that will reap where he hath not sowed,
and gather where he hath not strowed, <i>Mat. 25.
24</i>.</p>

<p>He that saith, it is or was our case, doth not rightly
understand himself or us, and he that takes his warrant
out of <i>Joh. 4. 37. 38.</i> is little acquainted with
Expositors. Wise men are amazed to hear that conscientious
Ministers dare spoile many Congregations
to make one for themselves.</p>

<p>In matter of Reformation, this would be remembred,
that in premonitory judgements, God will take
good words, and sincere intents; but in peremptory,
nothing but reall performances.<!-- Page 54 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Composition.</i></h3>

<p>If Reformation were come thus neer, I should
hope Composition were not farre off: When
hearts meet in God, they will soon meet in Gods
wayes, and upon Gods termes. But to avoid prolixity,
which steales upon me; For Composition, I shall compose
halfe a dozen distichs concerning these kind of
Wars; wishing I could sing asleep these odious stirres
at least on some part, with a dull Ode. He is no Cobler
that cannot sing, nor no good Cobler that can sing well:</p>

<p>Wee heare that <i>Majestas Imperii</i> hath challenged
<i>Salus Populi</i> into the field; the one fighting for Prerogatives,
the other defending Liberties: Were I a
Constable bigge enough, I would set one of them by
the heeles to keep both their hands quiet; I meane
onely in a paire of stocks, made of sound reason,
handsomely fitted for the legges of their Understanding.</p>

<p>If <i>Salus Populi</i> began, surely it was not that <i>Salus
Populi</i> which I left in <i>England</i>: That <i>Salus
Populi</i> was as mannerly a <i>Salus Populi</i> as need bee:
if I bee not much deceived, that <i>Salus Populi</i> suffer'd
its nose to be held to the Grindstone, till it was almost
ground to the grisles; and yet grew never the sharper
for ought I could discerne; What was, before
the world was made, I leave to better Antiquaries then
myselfe; but I thinke, since the world began, it was
never storied that <i>Salus Populi</i> began with <i>Majestas
Imperii</i>, unlesse <i>Majestas Imperii</i> first unharbour'd it,
and hunted it to a stand, and then it must either turne
head and live, or turn taile and die: but more have
been storyed on the other hand than <i>Majestas Imperii</i>
is willing to heare: I doubt not but <i>Majestas Imperii</i>
knows, that Common-wealths cost as much the
making as Crownes; and if they bee well made, would
yet outsell an ill-fashioned Crown, in any Market
overt, even in <i>Smithfield</i>, if they could be well
vouched.</p>

<p>But <i>Preces &amp; Lachrym&aelig;</i>, are the people's weapons:
so are Swords and Pistols, when God and Parliaments
bid them Arme. Prayers and Teares are<!-- Page 56 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
good weapons for them that have nothing but knees
and eyes; but most men are made with teeth and
nailes; onely they must neither scratch for Liberties,
nor bite Prerogatives, till they have wept and
prayed as God would have them. If Subjects must
fight for their Kings against other Kingdomes, when
their Kings will; I know no reason, but they may
fight against their Kings for their own Kingdomes,
when Parliaments say they may and must: but Parliaments
must not say they must, till God sayes they
may.</p>

<p>I can never beleeve that <i>Majestas Imperii</i>, was ever
so simple as to think, that if it extends it self beyond
its due Artique at one end, but <i>Salus Populi</i> must
Antartique it as farre at the other end, or else the
world will be Excentrick, and then it will whirle;
and if it once fall a whirling, ten to one, it will whirle
them off first, that sit in highest chaires on cushions
fill'd with Peacocks feathers; and they are like to
stand their ground fastest, that owne not one foot of
ground to stand upon. When Kings rise higher than
they should, they exhale Subjects higher than they
would: if the <i>Primum Mobile</i> should ascend one foot
higher than it is, it would hurry all the nether wheeles,
and the whole world on fire in 24 houres. No Prince
exceeds in Soveraignty, but his Subjects will exceed
as farre in some vitious Liberty, to abate their griefe;
or some pernicious mutiny, to abate their Prince.</p>

<p>Nor can I beleeve that Crownes trouble Kings
Heads, so much as Kings heads trouble Crownes: nor
that they are flowers of Crowns that trouble Crowns,
but rather some Nettles or Thistles mistaken for
flowers.</p>

<p>To speake plainer English, I have wondred these
thirty yeares what Kings aile: I have seen in my time,
the best part of twenty Christian Kings and Princes;
Yet as Christian as they were, some or other were still
scuffling for Prerogatives. It must be granted at all
hands, that <i>Pr&aelig;rogativ&aelig; Regis</i> are necessary Supporters
of State: and stately things to stately Kings:
but if withall, they be <i>Derogativ&aelig; Regno</i>, they are
but little things to wise Kings. Equity is as due
to People, as Eminency to Princes: Liberty to Subjects,
as Royalty to Kings: If they cannot walk together
lovingly hand in hand, <i>pari passu</i>, they must
cut girdles and part as good friends as they may: Nor
must it be taken offensively, that when Kings are
haling up their top-gallants, Subjects lay hold on their
slablines; the head and body must move alike: it is
nothing meet for me to say with <i>Horace</i>,</p>

<p>Distracting Nature, calls for distracting Remedies;
perturbing policies for disturbing cures: If one Ex<!-- Page 58 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>treame
should not constitute its Anti-Extreame, all
things would soon be in <i>extremo</i>: if ambitious windes
get into Rulers Crownes, rebellious vapours will into
Subjects Caps, bee they stopt never so close: Yet the
tongues of Times tell us of ten Preter-royall Usurpations,
to one contra-civill Rebellion.</p>

<p>Civill Liberties and Proprieties admeasured, to every
man to his true <i>suum</i>, are the <i>prima pura principia,
propria quarto modo</i>, the <i>sine quibus</i> of humane
States, without which, men are but women. Peoples
prostrations of these things when they may lawfully
helpe it, are prophane prostitutions; ignorant Ideottismes,
under naturall noddaries; and just it is that
such as undersell them, should not re-inherit them in
haste, though they seeke it carefully with teares. And
such usurpations by Rulers, are the unnaturalizings of
nature, disfranchisements of Freedome, the Neronian
nullifyings of Kingdomes: yea, I beleeve the Devill
himselfe would turne Round-head, rather then suffer
these Columnes of Common-wealths to be slighted:
as he is a creature, he feares decreation; as an Angell,
dehominations; as a Prince, dis-common-wealthings;
as finite, these pen-infinite insolencies, which are the
most finite Infinites of misery to men on this side the
worlds dissolution: therefore it is, that with Gods
leave, he hath sounded an alarm to all the <i>susque deques</i>,
pell-mels, one and alls, now harrassing sundry
parts of Christendome. It is enough for God to be Infinite,
too much for man to bee Indefinite. He that
will flye too high a quarry for Absolutenesse, shall
stoope as much too low before he remounts his proper<!-- Page 59 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
pitch: If <i>Jacob</i> will over top his brother out of Gods
time and way, he will so hamstring him, that hee shall
make legs whether he will or no, at his brothers approach:
and such as over-run all humane measure,
shall seldome returne to humane mercy: There are
sins besides the sin against the Holy Ghost, which
shall not be expiated by sacrifice for temporall revenge:
I mean when they are boyled up to a full consistence
of contumacy and impenitency. Let absolute Demands
or Commands be put into one scale, and indefinite
refusalls into the other: all the Goldsmiths in <i>Cheapeside</i>,
cannot tell which weighs heaviest. Intolerable
griefes to Subjects, breed the <i>Iliaca passio</i> in a body
politick, which inforces that upwards which should
not. I speak these things to excuse, what I may, my
Countrymen in the hearts of all that look upon their
proceedings.</p>

<p>There is a quadrobulary saying which passes current
in the Westerne World, That the Emperour is
King of Kings, the <i>Spaniard</i>, King of Men, the
<i>French</i>, King of Asses, the <i>King</i> of <i>England</i>, <i>King</i>
of Devills. By his leave that first brayed the speech,
they are pretty wise Devills and pretty honest; the
worse they doe, is to keep their Kings from devillizing,
and themselves from Assing: Were I a King (a simple
supposall) I would not part with one good English
Devill, for some two of the Emperours Kings, nor three
of the <i>Spaniards</i> Men, nor foure <i>French</i> Asses; If I
did I should thinke my selfe an Asse for my labour.
I know nothing that <i>Englishmen</i> want, but true
Grace, and honest pride; let them be well furnisht<!-- Page 60 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
with those two, I feare they would make more Asses,
then <i>Spaine</i> can make men, or the Emperour Kings.
You will say I am now beyond my latchet; but you
would not say so, if you knew how high my latchet
will stretch; when I heare a lye with a latchet, that
reaches up to his throat that first forged it.</p>

<p>He is a good King that undoes not his Subjects by
any one of his unlimited Prerogatives: and they are
a good People, that undoe not their Prince, by any
one of their unbounded Liberties, be they the very
least. I am sure either may, and I am sure neither
would be trusted, how good soever. Stories tell us
in effect, though not in termes, that over-risen Kings,
have been the next evills to the world, unto fallen Angels;
and that over-franchised people, are devills
with smooth snaffles in their mouthes. A King that
lives by Law, lives by love; and he that lives above
Law, shall live under hatred doe what he can. Slavery
and knavery goe as seldome asunder, as Tyranny
and Cruelty.</p>

<p>I have a long while thought it very possible, in a
time of Peace, and in some Kings Reigne, for disert
Statesmen, to cut an exquisite thred between Kings
Prerogatives, and Subjects Liberties of all sorts, so as
<i>C&aelig;sar</i> might have his due, and People their share,
without such sharpe disputes. Good Casuists would
case it, and case it, part it, and part it; now it, and
then it, punctually. <i>Aquinas</i>, <i>Suarez</i>, or <i>Valentia</i>,
would have done it long ere this, had they not beene
Popish, I might have said knavish; for, if they be so
any where, it is in their Tractates of Priviledges.<!-- Page 61 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Our Common Law doth well, but it must doe better before
things doe as they should. There are some <i>Maximes</i>
in Law, that would be taught to speake a little
more mannerly, or else well <i>Anti-Maxim'd</i>: we say,
the King can doe a Subject no wrong; why may wee
not say, the Parliament can doe the King no wrong?
We say, <i>Nullum tempus occurrit Regi</i> in taking
wrong; why may wee not say, <i>Nullum tempus succurrit
Regi</i> in doing wrong? which I doubt will
prove as good a Canon if well examined.</p>

<p>Authority must have power to make and keep people
honest; People, honesty to obey Authority; both,
a joynt-Councell to keep both safe. Morall Lawes,
Royall Prerogatives, Popular Liberties, are not of
Mans making or giving, but Gods: Man is but to
measure them out by Gods Rule: which if mans wisdome
cannot reach, Mans experience must mend:
And these Essentialls, must not be Ephorized or Tribuned
by one or a few Mens discretion, but lineally
sanctioned by Supreame Councels. In <i>pro-re-nascent</i>
occurrences, which cannot be foreseen; Diets, Parliaments,
Senates, or accountable Commissions, must
have power to consult and execute against intersilient
dangers and flagitious crimes prohibited by the light
of Nature: Yet it were good if States would let People
know so much beforehand, by some safe woven
<i>manifesto</i>, that grosse Delinquents may tell no tales of
Anchors and Buoyes, nor palliate their presumptions
with pretence of ignorance. I know no difference in
these Essentialls, between Monarchies, Aristocracies,
or Democracies; the rule will be found par-rationall,<!-- Page 62 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
say Schoolmen and Pretorians what they will. And
in all, the best Standard to measure Prerogatives, is
the Ploughstaffe; to measure Liberties, the Scepter:
if the tearms were a little altered into Loyall Prerogatives
and Royall Liberties, then we should be sure
to have Royall Kings and Loyall Subjects.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Subjects their King, the King his Subjects greets,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Whilome the Scepter and the Plough-staffe meets.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But Progenitors have had them for four and twenty
predecessions: that would be spoken in the Norman
tongue or Cimbrian, not in the English or Scottish:
When a Conquerour turnes Christian, Christianity
turns Conquerour: if they had had them time out
of minde of man, before <i>Adam</i> was made, it is not a
pin to the point in <i>foro rect&aelig; rationis</i>: Justice and
Equity were before time, and will be after it: Time
hath neither Politicks nor Ethicks, good nor evill in
it; it is an empty thing, as empty as a <i>New-English</i>
purse, and emptier it cannot bee: a man may break
his neck in time, and in a lesse time then he can
heale it.</p>

<p>But here is the deadly pang, it must now be taken
by force and dint of sword: I confesse it is a deadly
pang to a Spirit made all of flesh, but not to a mortified
heart: it is good to let God have his will as hee
please, when we have not reason to let him have it
as we should; remembring, that hitherto he hath
taken order, that ill Prerogatives gotten by the Sword,
should in time be fetcht home by the Dagger, if nothing
else will doe it: Yet I trust there is both day and<!-- Page 63 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
means to intervent this bargaine. But if they should;
if God will make both King and Kingdome the better
by it, what should either lose? I am sure there
is no great cause for either to make great brags.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>My Dearest Lord</i>, and my more than <i>dearest
King</i>, I most humbly beseech you upon mine
aged knees, that you would please to arme your minde
with patience of proofe, and to intrench your selfe as
deep as you can, in your wonted Royall meeknesse;
for I am resolved to display my unfurled soule in your
very face, and to storme you with volyes of Love and
Loyalty. You owe the meanest true Subject you
have, a close account of these open Warres: they are
no <i>Arcana imperii</i>. Then give mee leave to inquire
of your Majesty, what you make in fields of blood,
when you should be amidst your Parliament of peace:
What you doe sculking in the suburbs of Hell, when
your Royall Pallaces stand desolate, through your
absence? What moves you to take up Armes against
your faithfull Subjects, when your Armes should bee<!-- Page 64 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
embracing your mournfull Queen? What incenses
your heart to make so many widdowes and Orphans,
and among the rest your owne? Doth it become you,
the King of the stateliest Island the world hath, to
forsake your Throne, and take up the Manufacture of
cutting your Subjects throats, for no other sin, but
for Deifying you so over-much, that you cannot be
quiet in your Spirit, till they have pluckt you downe
as over-low? Doe your three Kingdomes so trouble
you, that they must all three be set on fire at once, that
when you have done, you may probably runne away
by their light into utter darknesse? Doe your three
Crownes sit so heavy on your head, that you will
break the backs of the three bodies that set them on,
and helpt you beare them so honourably? Have your
three Lamb-like flocks so molested you, that you must
deliver them up to the ravening teeth of evening
Wolves? Are you so angry with those that never
gave you just cause to be angry, but by their too much
feare to anger you at all, when you gave them cause
enough? Are you so weary of Peace, that you will
never be weary of Warre? Are you so willing to
warre at home, who were so unwilling to warre abroad,
where and when you should? Are you so
weary of being a good King, that you will leave your
selfe never a good Subject? Have you peace of Conscience,
in inforcing many of your Subjects to fight
for you against their Conscience? Are you provided
with Answers at the great Tribunall, for the destruction
of so many thousands, whereof every man was
as good a man as your Self, <i>qua</i> man?<!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>Is it not a most unworthy part for you to bee running
away from your Subjects in a day of battel, upon
whose Pikes you may come safe with your naked
breast and welcome? Is it honourable for you to be
flying on horses, from those that would esteeme it
their greatest honour, to beare you on their humble
shoulders to your Chaire of Estate, and set you down
upon a Cushion stuffed with their hearts? Is it your
prudence to be inraged with your best friends, for
adventuring their lives to rescue you from your worst
enemies? Were I a King, pardon the supposall, I
would hang that Subject by the head, that would not
take me by the heels, and dragge me to my Court,
when he sees me shifting for life in the ruined Countrey,
if nothing else would doe it; And I would
honour their very heels, that would take me by the
very head, and teach me, by all just meanes, to King
it better, when they saw me un-Kinging my selfe and
Kingdome: Doe you not know Sir, that, as when
your people are sicke of the Kings-evill, God hath
given you a gift to heale them? so when your selfe
are sicke of it, God hath given the Parliament a gift
to heale you: Hath your Subjects love been so great
to you, that you will spend it all, and leave your children
little or none? Are you so exasperated against
wise <i>Scotland</i>, that you will make <i>England</i> your foole
or foot-stoole? Is your fathers Sonne growne more
Orthodox, then his most Orthodox father, when he
told his Sonne, that a King was for a kingdome, and
not a kingdome for a King? parallell to that of the
Apostle; the husband is but by the wife, but the wife
of the husband.<!-- Page 66 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>Is <i>Majestas Imperii</i> growne so kickish, that it cannot
stand quiet with <i>Salus Populi</i>, unlesse it be fettered?
Are you well advised, in trampling your Subjects
so under your feet, that they can finde no place
to be safe in, but over your head: Are you so inexorably
offended with your Parliament, for suffering
you to returne as you did, when you came into their
house as you did, that you will be avenged on all
whom they represent? Will you follow your very
worst Councell so far, as to provoke your very best,
to take better counsell than ever they did? If your
Majesty be not Popish, as you professe, and I am
very willing to beleeve, why doe you put the Parliament
to resume the Sacrament of the Altar, or Consubstantions
in saying, the King and Parliament,
the King and Parliament? breaking your simple
Subjects braines to understand such mysticall Parleenment?
I question much, whether they were not better
speake plainer English, then such Latine as the
Angels can hardly construe, and God happily loves
not to perse; I can as well admit an ubiquitary King
as another, if a King be abroad in any good affaire;
but if a King be at home and will circumscribe himselfe
at <i>Oxford</i>, and proscribe or discribe his Parliament
at <i>Westminster</i>, if that <i>Parliament</i> will prescribe
what they ought, without such paradoxing, I
should think God would subscribe a <i>Le Dieu le
veult</i> readily enough.</p>

<p>Is your <i>Advisera</i> such a <i>Suavamen</i> to you, that
hath been such a <i>Gravamen</i> to Religion and Peace?
Shall the chiefe bearing wombe of your Kingdome,<!-- Page 67 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
be ever so constituted, that it cannot be delivered of
its owne deliverance, in what pangs soever it be, without
the will of one man-midwife, and such a man as
will come and not come, but as he list: nor bring a
Parliament to bed of a well-begotten Liberty without
an entire Subsidy? Doe not your Majesty being a
Schollar, know, that it was a truth long before it was
spoken, that <i>Mundus est unus aut nullus</i>, that there
is <i>Principum purum unum</i>, which unites the world
and all that is in it; where that is broken, things fall
asunder, that whatsoever is duable or triable, is fryable.</p>

<p>Is the <i>Militia</i> of your Kingdome, such an orient
flower of your Crowne, which all good Herbalists
judge but a meere nettle, while it is in any one mans
hand living? May not you as well challenge the absolute
disposall of all the wealth of the Kingdome
as of all the strength of your Kingdome? Can you
put any difference? unlesse it bee this, that mens
hearts and bones are within their skins, more proper
and intrinsecall, their lands and cattell more externall:
dare you not <i>concredit</i> the <i>Militia</i>, with those to
whom you may betrust your heart, better then your
owne breast? Will they ever harme you with the
<i>Militia</i>, that have no manner of <i>malitia</i> against you,
but for mis-imploying the <i>Militia</i> against them by
the <i>malitia</i> of your ill Counsellours? What good
will the <i>Militia</i> doe you when you have wasted the
Realme of all the best <i>Milites</i> it hath? May not your
Majesty see through a paire of Spectacles, glazed
with inch-board; that while you have your <i>Advisera</i>
in one hand, and the <i>Militia</i> in the other, you have<!-- Page 68 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
the neckes of your Subjects under your feet, but not
your heart in your owne hand? doe you not know
that <i>malum est, posse malum</i>?</p>

<p>Hath Episcopacy beene such a religious Jewell in
your State, that you will sell all or most of your Coronets,
Caps of honour, and blue Garters, for six and
twenty cloth Caps? and your Barons Cloakes, for so
many Rockets, whereof usually twenty have had
scarce good manners enough to keepe the other six
sweet? Is no Bishop no King, such an oraculous
Truth, that you will pawne your Crowne and life upon
it? if you will, God may make it true indeed on
your part: Had you rather part with all, then lose a
few superfluous tumours, to pare off your monstrousnesse?
Will you be so covetous, as to get more then
you ought, by losing more then you need? Have you
not driven good Subjects enough abroad, but you will
also slaughter them that stay at home? Will you take
such an ill course, that no prayers can fasten that good
upon you we desier? Is there not some worse root
than all these growing in your Spirit, bringing forth
all this bitter fruit? against which you should take up
Arms, rather then against your harmlesse Subjects?
Doe you not foresee, into what importable head-tearings
and heart-searchings you will be ingulfed, when
the Parliament shall give you a mate, though but a
Stale? Methinkes it should breake your heart, to see
such a one as I, presume so much upon your clemency
and too much upon your Majesty, which your
Selfe have so eclipsed by the interposall of your Selfe
between your Selfe and your Selfe, that it hath not<!-- Page 69 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
ray's enough left to dazle downe the height of my
affections to the awe of my Judgement.</p>

<p>Tres-Royall Sir, I once againe beseech you, with
teares dropping from my hoary head, to cover your
Selfe as close as you may, with the best shield of
goodnesse you have: I have somewhat more to say,
which may happily trouble not your Selfe, but your
followers, more than what is already said. There lived
in your Realme and Reigne two whom I may well
tearme Prophets, both now in a better Kingdome;
whereof one foretold two things concerning your Majesty,
of these very proceedings, long before they began;
which being done and past shall bee buried in
silence: the other made this prediction about the
same time.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>His words were in prose these, King <i>Charles</i> will
come into fetters, meaning strong afflictions, and then
prove as good a King, as such a good King of <i>Israel</i>,
whom he then named, but I need not: he was as inwardly

as religious Opticks of State, as any man I know:
foure other Predictions he made, full as improbable as
this, whereof three are punctually performed. A good
Christian being sometime in conflicts of Conscience,
hurried with long tentations, used this speech to my

<p>Much lamented Sir, If you will please to retire your
Selfe to your Closet, whither you may most safely
come, and make your peace with God, for the vast
heritage of sinne your Intombed father left upon your
score, the dreadful Imprecation he poured upon the
heads of his tender posterity in <i>Summersets</i> and <i>Overburyes</i>
Case, published in Starchamber by his Royall
command; your owne sinful marriage, the sophistocation
of Religion and Policie in your time, the luxury
your Court and Country, your connivance with the
Irish butcheries, your forgetfull breaches upon the
Parliament, your compliance with Popish Doegs, with
what else your Conscience shall suggest: and give
us, your guilty Subjects example to doe the like,
who have held pace and proportion with you in our
evill wayes: we will helpe you by Gods assistance,
to poure out rivers of tears, to wash away the streams
of blood, which have beene shed for these heavy accounts;
we will also helpe you, God helping us, to
beleeve, that there is hope in <i>Israel</i> for these things;
and Balme enough in his <i>Gilead</i> to heale all the broken
bones of your three kingdomes, and to redouble
your honour and our peace: His Arme is infinite;
to an infinite power all things are equally faisable, to
an infinite mercy, all sinnes equally pardonable. The
Lord worke these things in us and for us, for his compassions
sake in Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Sir, you may now please to discover your Selfe<!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
where you think meet; I trust I have not indangered
you: I presume your Ear-guard will keep farre enough
from you, what ever I have said: be it so, I have discharged
my duty, let them look to theirs. If my
tongue should reach your eares, which I little hope
for; Let it be once said; the great King of great <i>Britaine</i>,
tooke advise of a simple Cobler, yet such a Cobler,
as will not exchange either his blood or his pride,
with any Shoo-maker or Tanner in your Realme, nor
with any of your late Bishops which have flattered
you thus in peeces: I would not speake thus in the
eares of the world, through the month of the Presse
for all the plunder your plunderers have pillaged;
were it not somewhat to abate your Royall indignation
toward a loyall Subject; a Subject whose heart
hath been long carbonadoed, <i>des veniam verbo</i>, in
flames of affection towards you. Your Majesty knowes
or may know, time was, when I did, or would have
done you a better peece of service, than all your
Troopes and Regiments are now doing. Should I
heare any Gentleman that follows you, of my yeares,
say hee loves you better than I, if it were lawfull, I
would sweare by my Sword, he said more than his
sword would make good.</p>

<p>Gracious Sir, Vouchsafe to pardon me my no other
sins, but my long Idolatry towards you, and my loving
you too hard in this speech, and I will pardon you
your Treason against me, even me, by committing
Treason against your Selfe my Lord and King;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and<!-- Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>

brinke of your Honour and our Peace, stand not too
long there, your State is full of distractions, your people
of expectations, the importune Affaires of your
Kingdome perplexedly suspended, your good Subjects
are now rising into a resolution to pray you on to your
throne, or into your Tombe, into Grace with your Parliament
and People, or into Glory with the Saints in
Heaven; but how you will get into the one, without
passing first through th' other, is the riddle they cannot
untye. If they shall ply the Throne of Grace
hard, God will certainely heare, and in a short time<!-- Page 73 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
mould you to his minde, and convince you, that it
had and will bee farre easier to sit downe meekely
upon the <i>Rectum</i>, than to wander resolutely in obliquities,
which with Kings, seldome faile to dissembogue
into bottomlesse Seas of sorrows.</p>

<p>Dearest Sir, be intreated to doe what you doe sincerely;
the King of Heaven and Earth can search
and discover the hiddenest corner of your heart, your
Parliament understands you farre better then you may
conceive, they have many eares and eyes, and good
ones, I beleeve they are Religiously determined to
re-cement you to your Body so exquisitely, that the
Errors of State and Church, routed by these late stirs,
may not re-allee hereafter, nor Themselves be made
a curse to the issue of their own bodies, nor a Scoffe,
to all Politique Bodies in Europe. The Lord give
your Majesty and all your Royall Branches <i>the spirit
of wisedome and understanding</i>, <i>the Spirit of knowledge
and his feare</i>, for His mercy and Christ his sake.</p>

<p>I Would my skill would serve me also, as well as
my heart, to translate Prince <i>Rupert</i>, for his
Queen-mothers sake, <i>Eliz.</i> a second. Mismeane me
not. I have had him in my armes when he was
younger, I wish I had him there now: if I mistake
not, he promised then to be a good Prince, but I doubt
he hath forgot it: if I thought he would not be angry
with me, I would pray hard to his Maker, to make
him a right Roundhead, a wise hearted Palatine, a
thankfull man to the English; to forgive all his sinnes,
and at length to save his soule, notwithstanding all<!-- Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
his God-damne mee's: yet I may doe him wrong; I
am not certaine hee useth that oath; I wish no man
else would. I dare say the Devills dare not. I thank
God I have lived in a Colony of many thousand English
almost these twelve yeares, am held a very sociable
man; yet I may considerately say, I never heard
but one Oath sworne, nor never saw one man drunk,
nor ever heard of three women Adulteresses, in all
this time, that I can call to minde: If these sinnes
bee amongst us privily, the Lord heale us. I would
not bee understood to boast of our innocency; there
is no cause I should, our hearts may be bad enough,
and our lives much better. But to follow my businesse.</p>

<p>Prosecutions of Warres betweene a King and his
Parliament, are the direfull dilacerations of the world,
the cruell Catastrophes of States, dreadfull to speake
of; they are <i>nefanda &amp; n' agenda</i>: I know no
grounds can be given of them but two: Either upon
Reason founded upon some surmisall of Treason,
which my reason cannot reach: I could never conceive
why a rationall King should commit Treason
against a reasonable Parliament; or how a faithfull
Parliament against their lawfull King: the most I can
imagine, is a misprision of Treason, upon a misprision
of Reason. Hee that knows not the Spirit of his
King, is an Atheist. Our King is not <i>Charles le
simple</i> sometime of <i>France</i>: he understands not our
King that understands him not to bee understanding.
The Parliament is supposed Omniscient, because under
God they are Omnipotent: if a Parliament have<!-- Page 75 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
not as much knowledge and all other vertues, as all
the Kingdome beside, they are no good Abridgement
of the Common-wealth. I beleeve Remonstrances
have demonstrated enough concerning this point of
Reason, to give satisfaction to such as satisfaction will
satisfie.</p>


<p>Or upon Will.</p>

<p>The Will of a King is very numinous; it hath a
kinde of vast universality in it, it is many times greater
than the will of his whole kingdome, stiffened
with ill Counsell and ill Presidents: if it be not a foot
and half lesser than the Will of his Councell, and
three foot lesser than the Will of his Parliament, it is
too big. I think it were well for a King if hee had
no will at all, but were all Reason. What if he committed
his morall will to Divines, that were no Bishops?
his Politicall, to his Parliament, and a Councell
chosen by Parliament? that if ever it miscarry, they
may blame themselves most, and him least. I scarce
know any King that hath such advantage as ours;
his three kingdomes lye so distinct and entire, that if
he please, he might keep them like three gardens without
a weed, if he would let God keep his will, without
wilfulnesse and rashnesse.</p>

<p>I have observed men to have two kindes of Wills,
a Free-hold will, such as men hold in <i>Capite</i> of themselves;
or a Copy-hold will, held at the will of other
Lords or Ladies. I have read almost all the Common
Law of <i>England</i>, and some Statutes; yet I never
read, that the Parliament held their will in such<!-- Page 76 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
a <i>Capite</i>: their Tenure is <i>Knight-service</i>, and good
<i>Knight-service</i> too, or else they are to blame. And
I am sure, a King cannot hold by Copy, at the will of
other Lords; the Law calls that <i>base tenure</i>, inconsistent
with Royalty; much more base is it, to hold
at the will of Ladies: Apron-string <i>tenure</i> is very
weak, tyed but of a slipping knot, which a childe may
undoe, much more a King. It stands not with our
Queens honour to weare an Apron, much lesse her
Husband, in the strings; that were to insnare both
him and her self in many unsafeties. I never heard
our King was Effeminate: to be a little Uxorious personally,
is a vertuous vice in Oeconomicks; but Royally,
a vitious vertue in Politicks. To speak English,
Books and tongues tell us, I wish they tell us true,
that the Error of these Wars on our Kings part proceeds
only from ill Counsellours.</p>

<p>Ill Counsellours are very ill Gamesters; if they see
their own stake a losing, they will play away King,
Queen, Bishops, Knights, Rooks, Pawnes, and all,
before they will turne up the board: they that play
for lusts, will play away themselves, and not leave
themselves so much as a heart to repent; and then
there is no Market left but Hell; if the case be thus,
it is to no end to look for any end, till one side make
an end of the other.</p>

<h3><i>Cessation.</i></h3>

<p>If God would vouchsafe to give his Majesties Religion
and Reason, power to fling his Wills head
over the Wall, in matter of Composition, and his Subjects
strength to throw their lusts after it, Arms would
be soon laid down, and Peace soon taken up. They
that are not at peace with God, are not at peace with
themselves, whatever they think; and they that are
not at peace with themselves, cannot be at peace with
others, if occasion provokes, be their natures never so
good.</p>

<p>So farre as I can conjecture, the chiefe impediment
to a generall and mutuall Cessation of Armes, is, a
despaire of mutuall and generall forgivenesse. If ever
<i>England</i> had need of a generall Jubile in Heaven
and Earth, it is now. Our King and Parliament have
been at great strife, who should obtaine most Justice:
if they would now strive, who should shew most
Mercy, it would heare well throughout the world.
Here also my speech must be twofold and blind-fold.
It is now nine Moneths and more since the last credible
News was acted: it is possible by this, the Parliament
may be at the Kings mercy: Did I say a
Kings mercy? what can I say more? no man on
earth, can shew more mercy then a King, nor shall
need more, when he comes to give an Account of his
Kingdome: Nor did ever any Parliament merit more
mercy than this, for they never sinned, that I know,
I meane against the Common and Statute Law of
<i>England</i>: it is pity they who have given so many
general pardons, should want one now. If our King<!-- Page 78 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
hath lost his way, and thereby learned to looke to
his path better hereafter, and taught many Successors
to King it right for many Ages; Me thinks it
should impetrate a Royall Redintegration, upon a Royall
acknowledgement and ingagement. But how
should an erring King trust a provoked Parliament?
Surely he may trust God safe enough; who will never
trust that State more with a good King, that will
doe ill to a King that is turned so good. Me thinks
those passages of Scripture, <i>Esa. 43. 24, 25. chap.
57. 17, 18</i>. The strange illation, <i>Hos. 2. 13, 14.</i>
should melt a heart of steele into floods of mercy.</p>

<p>For others, were my head, one of the heads which
first gave the King Counsell to take up these Armes,
or to persist in them, when at any time he would
have disbanded, I would give that head to the Kingdome,
whether they would or no; if they would not
cut it off, I would cut it off myselfe, and tender it at
the Parliament doore, upon condition that all other
heads might stand, which stand upon penitent hearts,
and will doe better on than off; then I would carry
it to <i>London-Bridge</i>, and charge my tongue to teach
all tongues, to pronounce Parliament right hereafter.</p>

<p>When a kingdom is broken just in the neck joynt,
in my poore policy, ropes and hatchets are not the
kindliest instruments to set it: Next to the spilling
of the blood of Christ for sin, the sparing of the blood
of sinners, where it may be as well spared as spilt, is
the best way of expiation. It is no rare thing for
Subjects to follow a leading King; if he will take his
truncheon in his hand, it is to be expected many will<!-- Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
put their swords in their Belts. Sins that rise out of
mistake of judgement, are not so sinfull as those of
malice ordinarily: and when multitudes sin, multitudes
of mercy are the best Anodines.</p>

<p>Whosoever be pardoned, I pray not let <i>Britanicus</i>
scape, I mean a pardon. I take him to be a very
serviceable Gentleman; Out of my entire respect to
him, I shall presume to give him half a dozen stitches
of advice:</p>

<p>I intreat him to consider that our King is not onely
a man, but a King in affliction; Kings afflictions are
beyond Subjects apprehensions; a Crown may happily
ake as much as a whole Common-wealth.</p>

<p>I desire him also to conceale himself as deeply as
he can, if he cannot get a speciall pardon, to weare a
Latitat about his neck, or let him lie close under the
Philosophers stone, and I'le warrant him for ever
being found.</p>

<p>If he be discovered, I counsell him to get his head
set on faster than our <i>New-England</i> Taylors use to
set on Buttons; Kings, and Kings Childrens memories
are as keen as their Subjects wits.</p>

<p>If he fears any such thing, that he would come over
to us, to helpe recruite our bewildred brains: we will<!-- Page 80 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
promise to maintain him so long as he lives, if he
will promise to live no longer then we maintain him.</p>

<p>If he should bee discovered and his head chance
to be cut off against his will, I earnestly beseech him
to bequeath his wits to me and mine in Fee-simple,
for we want them, and cannot live by our hands in
this Country.</p>

<p>Lastly, I intreat him to keep his purse, I give
him my counsell <i>gratis</i>, confessing him to be more
then my match, and that I am very loath to fall into
his hands.</p>


<h3><i>Prosecution.</i></h3>

<p>If Reformation, Composition, Cessation, can finde
no admittance, there must and will be Prosecution:
to which I would also speak briefly and indifferently
still to both sides; and first to that, which I had rather
call Royalists then Cavaliers; who if I mistake
not, fight against the Truth.</p>

<p>Foolish Cowardly man (I pray patience, for I speak
nothing but the pulse of my owne heart) dreads and
hates, nothing in Heaven or Earth, so much as
Truth: it is not God, nor Law, nor sinne, nor death,
nor hell, that he feares, but onely because he feares
there is Truth in them: Could he de-truth them all,
he would defie them all: Let Perdition it self come
upon him with deadly threats, fiery swords, displayed
vengeance, he cares not: Let Salvation come cap
in hand, with naked Reason, harmelesse Religion,
lawny embracements, he will rather flye or dye, than
entertaine it: come Truth in what shape it will, hee<!-- Page 81 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
will reject it: and when hee can beat it off with
most steely prowesse, he thinkes himselfe the bravest
man; when in truth it is nothing but exsanguine feeble
exility of Spirit. Thy heart, saith the Prophet
<i>Ezek. 16. 30.</i> is weake, like the heart of an imperious
whorish woman: a man would thinke, the heart of
an imperious whore, were the very pummell of <i>Scanderbergs</i>
sword; alas, she is hen-hearted, shee dares
not looke Truth in the face; if she dared, shee would
neither be whorish, nor imperious, nor weake. He
shews more true fortitude, that prayes quarter of the
least Truth, at a miles distance, than hee that breakes
through and hewes downe the most Theban Phalanx
that ever field bore. <i>Paul</i> exprest more true valour,
in saying, I can doe nothing against the Truth, than
<i>Goliah</i>, in defying the whole hoste of <i>Israel</i>.</p>

<p>Couragious Gentlemen, Yee that will stab him
that gives you the lye; take heed yee spend not
your bloods, limbes and soules, in fighting for some
untruth: and yee that will fling out the gantlet to him
that calls you Coward, dishonour not your selves
with such Cowardise, as to fight against Truth, meerly
for feare of it. A thousand pities it is, such gallant
Spirits should spend their lives, honours, heritages,
and sweet relations in any Warres, where, for
ought many of them know, some false mistake commands
in Chiefe.</p>

<p>Honoured Country-men, bee intreated to love
Truth: if it loves not you againe, and repaires not all
your losses, then install some Untruth in its roome for
your Generall. If you will needs warre, be perswad<!-- Page 82 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>ed
to contend lawfully, wisely and stedfastly, against
all errours in Divinity and Policy: they are the cursed
Counter-mures, dropt Portcullises, scouring Angiports,
sulphurious Granado's, laden murtherers, peevish
Galthropes, and rascall desperadoes, which the Prince
of lyes imployes with all his skill and malice, to
maintaine the walls and gates of his kingdome, when
Truth would enter in with grace and peace to save
forlorne sinners, and distressed Commonwealthes:
witnesse the present deplorable estate of sundry States
in Europe.</p>

<p>Give me leave to speake a word more: it is but
this; Yee will finde it a farre easier field, to wage
warre against all the Armies that ever were or will be
on Earth, and all the Angels of Heaven, than to take
up Armes against any truth of God: It hath more
Counsell and strength than all the world besides; and
will certainely either gaine or ruine, convert or subvert
every man that opposes it. I hope ingenuous
men will rather take advice, then offence at what I
have said: I had rather please ten, than grieve one
intelligent man.</p>

<hr />

<p>If this side be resolute, I turne me to the other.</p>

<hr />

<p>Goe on brave Englishmen, in the name of God, go
on prosperously, because of Truth and Righteousnes:
Yee that have the Cause of Religion, the life of your
Kingdome and of all the good that is in it in your
hands: Goe on undauntedly: As you are Called and
Chosen, so be faithfull: Yee fight the battells of the
Lord, bee neither desidious nor perfidious: You serve<!-- Page 83 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
the King of Kings, who stiles you his heavenly Regiments:

your victuallers, his Truth your Trenches; where

you, you are above them; where hell it selfe
cannot hurt you, where your swords are furbushed
and sharpened by him that made their metall, where
your wounds are bound up with the oyle of a good
Cause, where your blood runs into the veynes of

<p>Goe on therefore Renowned Gentlemen, fall on
resolvedly, till your hands cleave to your swords, your
swords to your enemies hearts, your hearts to victory,
your victories to triumph, your triumphs to the everlasting
praise of him that hath given you Spirits to
offer your selves willingly, and to jeopard your lives
in high perils, for his Name and service sake.</p>

<p>And Wee your Brethren, though we necessarily
abide beyond <i>Jordan</i>, and remaine on the American
Sea-coasts, will send up Armies of prayers to the
Throne of Grace, that the God of power and goodnesse,
would incourage your hearts, cover your heads,
strengthen your arms, pardon your sinnes, save your
soules, and blesse your families, in the day of Battell.
Wee will also pray, that the same Lord of Hosts,
would discover the Counsels, defeat the Enterprizes,
deride the hopes, disdaine the insolencies, and wound
the hairy scalpes of your obstinate Enemies, and yet
pardon all that are unwillingly misled. Wee will
likewise helpe you beleeve that God will be seen on
the Mount, that it is all one with him, to save by
many or few, and that he doth but humble and try you
for the present, that he may doe you good at the latter
end. All which hee bring to passe who is able to
doe exceeding abundantly, above all we can aske or
thinke, for his Truth and mercy sake in Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Now I come to rubbe over my work, I finde five
or six things like faults, which would be mended
or commended, I know not well which, nor greatly
care.</p>


<p>1. For <i>Levity</i>, read, <i>Lepidity</i>, &mdash;&mdash; and that a
very little, and that very necessary, if not unavoydable.</p>

musick to me, to heare every Dity speak its spirit in
its apt tune: every breast, to sing its proper part, and
every creature, to expresse it self in its naturall note:
should I heare a Mouse roare like a Beare, a Cat lowgh
like an Oxe, or a Horse whistle like a Red-breast, it
would scare &mdash;&mdash; mee.</p>

but when it is whispered through a paire of lisping
teeth; Truth best, when it is spoken out, through a
paire of open lips. Ye make such a noyse there, with
Drums and Trumpets, that if I should not speak loud,
ye could not hear me: Ye talke one to another, with
whole Culvering and Canon; give us leave to talk
Squibs and Pistoletto's charged with nothing but powder
of Love and shot of Reason: if you will cut such
deep gashes in one anothers flesh, we must sow them

Reverend and dear friend,<br />
</p>

<p>I was yesterday convented before the bishop, I mean
to his court, and am adjourned to the next term. I see
such giants turn their backs, that I dare not trust my
own weak heart. I expect measure hard enough and must
furnish apace with proportionable armour. I lacke a
friend to help buckle it on. I know none but Christ himself
in all our coast fitt to help me, and my acquaintance
with him is hardly enough to hope for that assistance my
weak spirit will want, and the assaults of tentation call
for. I pray therefore forget me not and believe for me
also if there be such a piece of neighbourhood among
Christians. And so blessing God with my whole heart
for my knowledge of you and immerited interest in you,
and thanking you entirely for that faithful love I have
found from you in many expressions of the best nature,
I commit you to the unchangeable love of God our Father
in his son Jesus Christ, in whom I hope to rest for
ever.</p>

LETTER FROM GYLES FYRMIN TO GOV. WINTHROP.</p>

<p>
Much honoured and deare Sir,<br />
</p>

<p>But that I thinke it needlesse (God havinge more than
ordinarye fitted you for such trials) my letter might
tell you with what griefe of spirit I received the news of
that sad affliction which is lately happened to your worship,
by means of that unfaithful wretch; I hope God will find
a shoulder to helpe you beare so great a burthen. But the
little time there is allotted me to write I must spend in requesting
your worships counsel and favour. My father in
law Ward, since his sonne came over, is varey desirous that
wee might sett down together, and so that he might leave
us together if God should remove him from hence. Because
that it cannot be accomplished in this town, is verey desirous
to get mee to remove with him to a new plantation. After
much perswasion used, consideringe my want of accommodation
here (the ground the town having given mee lying 5
miles from mee or more) and that the gaines of physick will
not finde mee with bread, but, besides, apprehendinge that it
might bee a way to free him from some temptations, and
make him more cheereful and serviceable to the country or
church, have yeelded to him. Herein, as I desire your counsel,
so I humbly request your favour, that you would be pleased
to give us the libertye of choosinge a plantation; wee
thinke it will be at Pentuckett, or Quichichchek, by Shawshin:
So soon as the season will give us leave to goe, wee
shall informe your worship which we desire: And if that,
by the court of election, we cannot gather a company to
beegine it, wee will let it fall. Wee desire you would not
graunt any of them to any before wee have seene them. If
your worship have heard any relation of the places, wee
should remaine thankful to you, if you would bee pleased to
counsel us to any of them. Further, I would entreate for advise
in this: The towne gave mee the ground (100 acres)
upon this condition, that I should stay in the towne 3 yeeres,<!-- Page 103 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
or else I could not sell it: Now my father supposes it being
my first heritage (my father having none in the land) that it
is more than they canne doe to hinder mee thus, when as
others have no business, but range from place to place, on

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
