    <h2>
      PREFATORY LETTER TO REV. CREAM CHEESE.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      REV. AND DEAR SIR:
    </h3>
    <p>
      It is surely unnecessary to call the attention of so astute an observer,
      and so austere a critic, as yourself, to the fact that the title of the
      leading essay in this little volume (of which, permit me to say, you are
      so essential an ornament) is marked as a quotation; and a quotation, as
      you will very well remember, from the lips of our friend, Mrs, Potiphar,
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, Rev. Sir, your judgment, which, you must allow me to say, is no
      less impartial than your experience is profound, will suggest to you that
      the subject of that essay (of the points of which the succeeding sketches
      are but elaborations) is the aspect of what is currently termed "our best
      society"&mdash;whether with reason or not, is beside the purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your pastoral charity, I am convinced, will persuade you to direct the
      attention of your parishioners to this fact, and to assure them, that,
      when you prepared your timely treatise upon the progress of purple
      chasubles among the Feejee islanders, you were not justly amenable to the
      charge of omitting all notice of the cultivation of artificial flowers by
      the Grim Tartars. The latter are, I believe, a very estimable people, but
      they were not the subjects of your consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      To those in your parish, and elsewhere, who have thought fit to suppose
      that Mrs. Potiphar is Mrs. Somebody-else,&mdash;what can we say? conscious
      as we are, that they who have once known that lady could never confound
      her with another.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for those who have actually supposed you, yourself, Reverend Sir, to
      be, not somebody else, but nobody, (!) we can only smile compassionately,
      and express the hope that a broader experience may give them greater
      wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      In taking leave of you, Sir, I know that I express the warmest wish of a
      large, a very large parish (might almost say, diocese) that you may long
      survive. For your parish is fully, and, as I think, most correctly
      persuaded, that while there is a Cream Cheese, there will always be a Mrs.
      Potiphar.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all proper regard,
    </p>
    <p>
      I am,
    </p>
    <p>
      Reverend and Dear Sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      Your very obedient,
    </p>
    <p>
      humble servant,
    </p>
    <p>
      THE EDITOR.

      I. &mdash; "OUR BEST SOCIETY."
    </h2>
    <p>
      If gilt were only gold, or sugar-candy common sense, what a fine thing our
      society would be! If to lavish money upon <i>objets de vertu</i>, to wear
      the most costly dresses, and always to have them cut in the height of the
      fashion; to build houses thirty feet broad, as if they were palaces; to
      furnish them with all the luxurious devices of Parisian genius; to give
      superb banquets; at which your guests laugh, and which make you miserable;
      to drive a fine carriage and ape the European liveries, and crests, and
      coats-of-arms; to resent the friendly advances of your baker's wife, and
      the lady of your butcher, (you being yourself a cobbler's daughter); to
      talk much of the "old families" and of your aristocratic foreign friends;
      to despise labour; to prate of "good society;" to travesty and parody, in
      every conceivable way, a society which we know only in books and by the
      superficial observation of foreign travel, which arises out of a social
      organization entirely unknown to us, and which is opposed to our
      fundamental and essential principles; if all this were fine, what a
      prodigiously fine society would ours be!
    </p>
    <p>
      This occurred to us upon lately receiving a card of invitation to a
      brilliant ball. We were quietly ruminating over our evening fire, with
      Disraeli's Wellington speech, "all tears," in our hands, with the account
      of a great man's burial, and a little man's triumph across the channel. So
      many great men gone, we mused, and such great crises impending! This
      democratic movement in Europe; Kossuth&mdash;and Mazzini waiting for the
      moment to give the word; the Russian bear watchfully sucking his paws; the
      Napoleonic empire redivivus; Cuba, and annexation, and slavery; California
      and Australia, and the consequent considerations of political economy;
      dear me! exclaimed we, putting on a fresh hodful of coal, we must look a
      little into the state of parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we put down the coal-scuttle there was a knock at the door. We said,
      "come in," and in came a neat Alhambra-watered envelope, containing the
      announcement that the queen of fashion was "at home" that evening week.
      Later in the evening came a friend to smoke a cigar. The card was lying
      upon the table, and he read it with eagerness. "You'll go, of course,"
      said he, "for you will meet all the 'best society.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Shall we, truly? Shall we really see the "best society of the city," the
      picked flower of its genius, character, and beauty? What makes the "best
      society" of men and women? The noblest specimens of each, of course. The
      men who mould the time, who refresh our faith in heroism and virtue, who
      make Plato and Zeno, and Shakespeare, and all Shakespeare's gentlemen,
      possible, again. The women, whose beauty, and sweetness, and dignity, and
      high accomplishment, and grace, make us understand the Greek Mythology,
      and weaken our desire to have some glimpse of the most famous women of
      history. The "best society" is that in which the virtues are most shining,
      which is the most charitable, forgiving, long-suffering, modest, and
      innocent. The "best society" is, in its very name, that in which there is
      the least hypocrisy and insincerity of all kinds, which recoils from, and
      blasts, artificiality, which is anxious to be all that it is possible to
      be, and which sternly reprobates all shallow pretence, all coxcombry and
      foppery, and insists upon simplicity as the infallible characteristic of
      true worth. That is the "best society," which comprises the best men and
      women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had we recently arrived from the moon, we might, upon hearing that we were
      to meet the "best society," have fancied that we were about to enjoy an
      opportunity not to be overvalued. But unfortunately we were not so freshly
      arrived. We had received other cards, and had perfected our toilette many
      times, to meet this same society, so magnificently described, and had
      found it the least "best" of all. Who compose it? Whom shall we meet if we
      go to this ball? We shall meet three classes of persons: first, those who
      are rich, and who have all that money can buy; second, those who belong to
      what are technically called "the good old families," because some ancestor
      was a man of mark in the state or country, or was very rich, and has kept
      the fortune in the family; and thirdly, a swarm of youths who can dance
      dexterously, and who are invited for that purpose. Now these are all
      arbitrary and factitious distinctions upon which to found so profound a
      social difference as that which exists in American, or, at least, in New
      York society. First, as a general rule, the rich men of every community
      who make their own money are not the most generally intelligent and
      cultivated. They have a shrewd talent which secures a fortune, and which
      keeps them closely at the work of amassing from their youngest years until
      they are old. They are sturdy men of simple tastes often. Sometimes,
      though rarely, very generous, but necessarily with an altogether false and
      exaggerated idea of the importance of money. They are rather rough,
      unsympathetic, and, perhaps, selfish class, who, themselves, despise
      purple and fine linen, and still prefer a cot-bed and a bare room,
      although they may be worth millions. But they are married to scheming, or
      ambitious, or disappointed women, whose life is a prolonged pageant, and
      they are dragged hither and thither in it, are bled of their golden blood,
      and forced into a position they do not covet and which they despise. Then
      there are the inheritors of wealth. How many of them inherit the valiant
      genius and hard frugality which built up their fortunes; how many
      acknowledge the stern and heavy responsibility of their opportunities; how
      many refuse to dream their lives away in a Sybarite luxury; how many are
      smitten with the lofty ambition of achieving an enduring name by works of
      a permanent value; how many do not dwindle into dainty dilettanti, and
      dilute their manhood with factitious sentimentality instead of a hearty
      human sympathy; how many are not satisfied with having the fastest horses
      and the "crackest" carriages, and an unlimited wardrobe, and a weak
      affectation and puerile imitation of foreign life?
    </p>
    <p>
      {Illustration}
    </p>
    <p>
      And who are these of our secondly, these "old families"? The spirit of our
      time and of our country knows no such thing, but the habitué of society
      hears constantly of "a good family." It means simply, the collective mass
      of children, grandchildren, nephews, nieces, and descendants of some man
      who deserved well of his country, and whom his country honors. But sad is
      the heritage of a great name! The son of Burke will inevitably be measured
      by Burke. The niece of Pope must show some superiority to other women (so
      to speak), or her equality is inferiority. The feeling of men attributes
      some magical charm to blood, and we look to see the daughter of Helen as
      fair as her mother, and the son of Shakespeare musical as his sire. If
      they are not so, if they are merely names, and common persons&mdash;if
      there is no Burke, nor Shakespeare, nor Washington, nor Bacon, in their
      words, or actions, or lives, then we must pity them, and pass gently on,
      not upbraiding them, but regretting that it is one of the laws of
      greatness that it dwindles all things in its vicinity, which would
      otherwise show large enough. Nay, in our regard for the great man, we may
      even admit to a compassionate honor, as pensioners upon our charity, those
      who bear and transmit his name. But if these heirs should presume upon
      that fame, and claim any precedence of living men and women because their
      dead grandfather was a hero,&mdash;they must be shown the door directly.
      We should dread to be born a Percy, or a Colonna, or a Bonaparte. We
      should not like to be the second Duke of Wellington, nor Charles Dickens,
      jr. It is a terrible thing one would say, to a mind of honorable feeling,
      to be pointed out as somebody's son, or uncle, or granddaughter, as if the
      excellence were all derived. It must be a little humiliating to reflect
      that if your great uncle had not been somebody, you would be nobody,&mdash;that
      in fact, you are only a name, and that, if you should consent to change it
      for the sake of a fortune, as is sometimes done, you would cease to be any
      thing but a rich man. "My father was President, or Governor of the State,"
      some pompous man may say. But, by Jupiter! king of gods and men, what are
      <i>you?</i> is the instinctive response. Do you not see, our pompous
      friend, that you are only pointing your own unimportance? If your father
      was Governor of the State, what right have you to use that fact only to
      fatten your self-conceit? Take care, good care; for whether you say it by
      your lips or by your life that withering response awaits you,&mdash;"then
      what are <i>you?</i>" If your ancestor was great, you are under bonds to
      greatness. If you are small, make haste to learn it betimes, and, thanking
      Heaven that your name has been made illustrious, retire into a corner and
      keep it, at least, untarnished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our thirdly, is a class made by sundry French tailors, bootmakers,
      dancing-masters, and Mr. Brown. They are a corps-de-ballet, for the use of
      private entertainments. They are fostered by society for the use of young
      debutantes, and hardier damsels, who have dared two or three years of the
      "tight" polka. They are cultivated for their heels, not their heads. Their
      life begins at ten o'clock in the evening, and lasts until four in the
      morning. They go home and sleep until nine; then they reel, sleepy, to
      counting-houses and offices, and doze on desks until dinner-time. Or,
      unable to do that, they are actively at work all day, and their cheeks
      grow pale, and their lips thin, and their eyes bloodshot and hollow, and
      they drag themselves home at evening to catch a nap until the ball begins,
      or to dine and smoke at their club, and be very manly with punches and
      coarse stories; and then to rush into hot and glittering rooms and seize
      very decolleté girls closely around the waist, and dash with them around
      an area of stretched linen, saying in the panting pauses, "How very hot it
      is!" "How very pretty Miss Podge looks!" "What a good redowa!" "Are you
      going to Mrs. Potiphar's?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Is this the assembled flower of manhood and womanhood, called "best
      society," and to see which is so envied a privilege? If such are the
      elements, can we be long in arriving at the present state, and necessary
      future condition of parties?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vanity Fair," is peculiarly a picture of modern society. It aims at
      English follies, but its mark is universal, as the madness is. It is
      called a satire, but after much diligent reading, we cannot discover the
      satire. A state of society not at all superior to that of "Vanity Fair" is
      not unknown to our experience; and, unless truth-telling be satire; unless
      the most tragically real portraiture be satire; unless scalding tears of
      sorrow, and the bitter regret of a manly mind over the miserable spectacle
      of artificiality, wasted powers, misdirected energies, and lost
      opportunities, be satirical; we do not find satire in that sad story. The
      reader closes it with a grief beyond tears. It leaves a vague apprehension
      in the mind, as if we should suspect the air to be poisoned. It suggests
      the terrible thought of the enfeebling of moral power, and the
      deterioration of noble character, as a necessary consequence of contact
      with "society." Every man looks suddenly and sharply around him, and
      accosts himself and his neighbors, to ascertain if they are all parties to
      this corruption. Sentimental youths and maidens, upon velvet sofas, or in
      calf-bound libraries, resolve that it is an insult to human nature&mdash;are
      sure that their velvet and calf-bound friends are not like the dramatis
      personae of "Vanity Fair," and that the drama is therefore hideous and
      unreal. They should remember, what they uniformly and universally forget,
      that we are not invited, upon the rising of the curtain to behold a
      cosmorama, or picture of the world, but a representation of that part of
      it called Vanity Fair. What its just limits are-how far its poisonous
      purlieus reach&mdash;how much of the world's air is tainted by it, is a
      question which every thoughtful man will ask himself, with a shudder, and
      look sadly around, to answer. If the sentimental objectors rally again to
      the charge, and declare that, if we wish to improve the world, its
      virtuous ambition must be piqued and stimulated by making the shining
      heights of "the ideal" more radiant; we reply, that none shall surpass us
      in honoring the men whose creations of beauty inspire and instruct
      mankind. But if they benefit the world, it is no less true that a vivid
      apprehension of the depths into which we are sunken or may sink, nerves
      the soul's courage quite as much as the alluring mirage of the happy
      heights we may attain. "To hold the mirror up to Nature," is still the
      most potent method of shaming sin and strengthening virtue.

      If "Vanity Fair" is a satire, what novel of society is not? Are "Vivian
      Grey," and "Pelham," and the long catalogue of books illustrating English,
      or the host of Balzacs, Sands, Sues, and Dumas, that paint French society,
      any less satires? Nay, if you should catch any dandy in Broadway, or in
      Pall-Mall, or upon the Boulevards, this very morning, and write a coldly
      true history of his life and actions, his doings and undoings, would it
      not be the most scathing and tremendous satire?&mdash;if by satire you
      mean the consuming melancholy of the conviction, that the life of that
      pendant to a moustache, is an insult to the possible life of a man?

      We have read of a hypocrisy so thorough, that it was surprised you should
      think it hypocritical; and we have bitterly thought of the saying, when
      hearing one mother say of another mother's child, that she had "made a
      good match," because the girl was betrothed to a stupid boy whose father
      was rich. The remark was the key of our social feeling.

      Let us look at it a little, and, first of all, let the reader consider the
      criticism, and not the critic. We may like very well, in our individual
      capacity, to partake of the delicacies prepared by our hostess's <i>chef</i>,
      we may not be adverse to <i>paté</i>, and myriad <i>objets de goût</i>,
      and if you caught us in a corner at the next ball, putting away a fair
      share of <i>dinde aux truffes</i>, we know you would have at us, in a tone
      of great moral indignation, and wish to know why we sneaked into great
      houses, eating good suppers, and drinking choice wines, and then went away
      with an indigestion, to write dyspeptic disgusts at society.
    </p>
    <p>
      We might reply that it is necessary to know something of a subject before
      writing about it, and that if a man wished to describe the habits of South
      Sea Islanders, it is useless to go to Greenland; we might also confess a
      partiality for <i>paté</i>, and a tenderness for <i>truffes</i>, and
      acknowledge that, considering our single absence would not put down
      extravagant, pompous parties, we were not strong enough to let the morsels
      drop into unappreciating mouths; or we might say, that if a man invited us
      to see his new house, it would not be ungracious nor insulting to his
      hospitality, to point out whatever weak parts we might detect in it, nor
      to declare our candid conviction, that it was built upon wrong principles
      and could not stand. He might believe us if we had been in the house, but
      he certainly would not, if we had never seen it. Nor would it be a very
      wise reply upon his part, that we might build a better if we didn't like
      that. We are not fond of David's pictures, but we certainly could never
      paint half so well; nor of Pope's poetry, but posterity will never hear of
      our verses. Criticism is not construction, it is observation. If we could
      surpass in its own way every thing which displeased us, we should make
      short work of it, and instead of showing what fatal blemishes deform our
      present society, we should present a specimen of perfection, directly.

      We went to the brilliant ball. There was too much of everything. Too much
      light, and eating, and drinking, and dancing, and flirting, and dressing,
      and feigning, and smirking, and much too many people. Good taste insists
      first upon fitness. But why had Mrs. Potiphar given this ball? We inquired
      industriously, and learned it was because she did not give one last year.
      Is it then essential to do this thing biennially? inquired we with some
      trepidation. "Certainly," was the bland reply, "or society will forget
      you." Everybody was unhappy at Mrs. Potiphar's, save a few girls and boys,
      who danced violently all the evening. Those who did not dance walked up
      and down the rooms as well as they could, squeezing by non-dancing ladies,
      causing them to swear in their hearts as the brusque broadcloth carried
      away the light outworks of gauze and gossamer. The dowagers, ranged in
      solid phalanx, occupied all the chairs and sofas against the wall, and
      fanned themselves until supper-time, looking at each other's diamonds, and
      criticising the toilettes of the younger ladies, each narrowly watching
      her peculiar Polly Jane, that she did not betray too much interest in any
      man who was not of a certain fortune. It is the cold, vulgar truth, madam,
      nor are we in the slightest degree exaggerating. Elderly gentlemen,
      twisting single gloves in a very wretched manner, came up and bowed to the
      dowagers, and smirked, and said it was a pleasant party, and a handsome
      house, and then clutched their hands behind them, and walked miserably
      away, looking as affable as possible. And the dowagers made a little fun
      of the elderly gentlemen, among themselves, as they walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the younger non-dancing men&mdash;a class of the community who
      wear black cravats and waistcoats, and thrust their thumbs and forefingers
      in their waistcoat pockets, and are called "talking men." Some of them are
      literary, and affect the philosopher; have, perhaps, written a book or
      two, and are a small species of lion to very young ladies. Some are of the
      <i>blasé</i> kind; men who affect the extremest elegance, and are reputed
      "so aristocratic," and who care for nothing in particular, but wish they
      had not been born gentlemen, in which case they might have escaped ennui.
      These gentlemen stand with hat in hand, and coats and trowsers most
      unexceptionable. They are the "so gentlemanly" persons of whom one hears a
      great deal, but which seems to mean nothing but cleanliness. Vivian Grey
      and Pelham are the models of their ambition, and they succeed in being
      Pendennis. They enjoy the reputation of being "very clever," and "very
      talented fellows," "smart chaps," etc., but they refrain from proving what
      is so generously conceded. They are often men of a certain cultivation.
      They have travelled, many of them,&mdash;spending a year or two in Paris,
      and a month or two in the rest of Europe. Consequently they endure society
      at home, with a smile, and a shrug, and a graceful superciliousness, which
      is very engaging. They are perfectly at home, and they rather despise
      Young America, which, in the next room, is diligently earning its
      invitation. They prefer to hover about the ladies who did not come out
      this season, but are a little used to the world, with whom they are upon
      most friendly terms, and who criticise together very freely all the great
      events in the great world of fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      These elegant Pendennises we saw at Mrs. Potiphar's, but not without a
      sadness which can hardly be explained. They had been boys once, all of
      them, fresh and frank-hearted, and full of a noble ambition. They had read
      and pondered the histories of great men; how they resolved, and struggled,
      and achieved. In the pure portraiture of genius, they had loved and
      honored noble women, and each young heart was sworn to truth and the
      service of beauty. Those feelings were chivalric and fair. Those boyish
      instincts clung to whatever was lovely, and rejected the specious snare,
      however graceful and elegant. They sailed, new knights, upon that old and
      endless crusade against hypocrisy and the devil, and they were lost in the
      luxury of Corinth, nor longer seek the difficult shores beyond. A present
      smile was worth a future laurel. The ease of the moment was worth immortal
      tranquillity. They renounced the stern worship of the unknown God, and
      acknowledged the deities of Athens. But the seal of their shame is their
      own smile at their early dreams, and the high hopes of their boyhood,
      their sneering infidelity of simplicity, their skepticism of motives and
      of men. Youths, whose younger years were fervid with the resolution to
      strike and win, to deserve, at least, a gentle remembrance, if not a
      dazzling fame, are content to eat, and drink, and sleep well; to go to the
      opera and all the balls; to be known as "gentlemanly," and "aristocratic,"
      and "dangerous," and "elegant;" to cherish a luxurious and enervating
      indolence, and to "succeed," upon the cheap reputation of having been
      "fast" in Paris. The end of such men is evident enough from the beginning.
      They are snuffed out by a "great match," and become an appendage to a rich
      woman; or they dwindle off into old roués, men of the world in sad
      earnest, and not with elegant affectation, <i>blasé</i>; and as they began
      Arthur Pendennises, so they end the Major. But, believe it, that old
      fossil heart is wrung sometimes by a mortal pang, as it remembers those
      squandered opportunities and that lost life.
    </p>
    <p>
      From these groups we passed into the dancing-room. We have seen dancing in
      other countries, and dressing. We have certainly never seen gentlemen
      dance so easily, gracefully and well as the American. But the <i>style</i>
      of dancing, in its whirl, its rush, its fury, is only equalled by that of
      the masked balls at the French Opera, and the balls at the <i>Salle
      Valentino</i>, the <i>Jardin Mabille</i>, the <i>Chateau Rouge</i>, and
      other favorite resorts of Parisian Grisettes and Lorettes. We saw a few
      young men looking upon the dance very soberly, and, upon inquiry, learned
      that they were engaged to certain ladies of the corps-de-ballet. Nor did
      we wonder that the spectacle of a young woman whirling in a <i>décolleté</i>
      state, and in the embrace of a warm youth, around a heated room, induced a
      little sobriety upon her lover's face, if not a sadness in his heart.
      Amusement, recreation, enjoyment! There are no more beautiful things. But
      this proceeding falls under another head. We watch the various toilettes
      of these bounding belles. They were rich and tasteful. But a man at our
      elbow, of experience and shrewd observation, said, with a sneer, for which
      we called him to account, "I observe that American ladies are so rich in
      charms that they are not at all chary of them. It is certainly generous to
      us miserable blackcoats. But, do you know, it strikes me as a generosity
      of display that must necessarily leave the donor poorer in maidenly
      feeling." We thought ourselves cynical, but this was intolerable; and in a
      very crisp manner we demanded an apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," responded our friend with more of sadness than of satire in his
      tone, "why are you so exasperated? Look at this scene! Consider that this
      is, really, the life of these girls. This is what they 'come out' for.
      This is the end of their ambition. They think of it, dream of it, long for
      it. Is it amusement? Yes, to a few, possibly. But listen, and gather, if
      you can, from their remarks (when they make any) that they have any
      thought beyond this, and going to church very rigidly on Sunday. The vigor
      of polking and church-going are proportioned; as is the one so is the
      other. My young friend, I am no ascetic, and do not suppose a man is
      damned because he dances. But Life is not a ball (more's the pity, truly,
      for these butterflies), nor is its sole duty and delight, dancing. When I
      consider this spectacle,&mdash;when I remember what a noble and beautiful
      woman is, what a manly man,&mdash;when I reel, dazzled by this glare,
      drunken with these perfumes, confused by this alluring music, and reflect
      upon the enormous sums wasted in a pompous profusion that delights no one,&mdash;when
      I look around upon all this rampant vulgarity in tinsel and Brussels lace,
      and think how fortunes go, how men struggle and lose the bloom of their
      honesty, how women hide in a smiling pretence, and eye with caustic
      glances their neighbor's newer house, diamonds, or porcelain, and observe
      their daughters, such as these,&mdash;why, I tremble and tremble, and this
      scene to-night, every 'crack' ball this winter will be, not the pleasant
      society of men and women, but&mdash;even in this young country&mdash;an
      orgie such as rotting Corinth saw, a frenzied festival of Rome in its
      decadence."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sober truth in this bitterness, and we turned away to escape
      the sombre thought of the moment. Addressing one of the panting Houris who
      stood melting in a window, we spoke (and confess how absurdly) of the
      Düsseldorf Gallery. It was merely to avoid saying how warm the room was,
      and how pleasant the party was; facts upon which we had already
      sufficiently enlarged. "Yes, they are pretty pictures; but la! how long it
      must have taken Mr. Düsseldorf to paint them all;" was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the Farnesian Hercules! no Roman sylph in her city's decline would ever
      have called the sun-god, Mr. Apollo. We hope that Houri melted entirely
      away in the window, but we certainly did not stay to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing out toward the supper-room we encountered two young men. "What,
      Hal," said one, "<i>you</i> at Mrs. Potiphar's?" It seems that Hal was a
      sprig of one of the old "families." "Well, Joe," said Hal, a little
      confused, "it <i>is</i> a little strange. The fact is I didn't mean to be
      here, but I concluded to compromise by coming, <i>and not being introduced
      to the host</i>." Hal could come, eat Potiphar's supper, drink his wines,
      spoil his carpets, laugh at his fashionable struggles, and affect the
      puppyism of a foreign Lord, because he disgraced the name of a man who had
      done some service somewhere, while Potiphar was only an honest man who
      made a fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supper-room was a pleasant place. The table was covered with a chaos
      of supper. Everything sweet and rare, and hot and cold, solid and liquid,
      was there. It was the very apotheosis of gilt gingerbread. There was a
      universal rush and struggle. The charge of the guards at Waterloo was
      nothing to it. Jellies, custards, oyster-soup, ice-cream, wine and water,
      gushed in profuse cascades over transparent precipices of <i>tulle</i>,
      muslin, gauze, silk, and satin. Clumsy boys tumbled against costly dresses
      and smeared them with preserves,&mdash;when clean plates failed, the
      contents of plates already used were quietly "chucked" under the table&mdash;heeltaps
      of champagne were poured into the oyster tureens or overflowed upon plates
      to clear the glasses&mdash;wine of all kinds flowed in torrents,
      particularly down the throats of very young men, who evinced their manhood
      by becoming noisy, troublesome, and disgusting, and were finally either
      led, sick, into the hat room, or carried out of the way, drunk. The supper
      over, the young people attended by their matrons descended to the
      dancing-room for the "German." This is a dance commencing usually at
      midnight or a little after, and continuing indefinitely toward daybreak.
      The young people were attended by their matrons, who were there to
      supervise the morals and manners of their charges. To secure the
      performance of this duty, the young people took good care to sit where the
      matrons could not see them, nor did they, by any chance, look toward the
      quarter in which the matrons sat. In that quarter through all the varying
      mazes of the prolonged dance, to two o'clock, to three, to four, sat the
      bediamonded dowagers, the mothers, the matrons,&mdash;against nature,
      against common sense. They babbled with each other, they drowsed, they
      dozed. Their fans fell listless into their laps. In the adjoining room,
      out of the waking sight, even, of the then sleeping mammas, the daughters
      whirled in the close embrace of partners who had brought down bottles of
      champagne from the supper-room, and put them by the side of their chairs
      for occasional refreshment during the dance. The dizzy hours staggered by&mdash;"Azalia,
      you <i>must</i> come now," had been already said a dozen times, but only
      as by the scribes. Finally it was declared with authority. Azalia went,&mdash;Amelia&mdash;Arabella.
      The rest followed. There was a prolonged cloaking, there were lingering
      farewells. A few papas were in the supper-room, sitting among the <i>débris</i>
      of game. A few young non-dancing husbands sat beneath gas unnaturally
      bright, reading whatever chance book was at hand, and thinking of the
      young child at home waiting for mamma who was dancing the "German" below.
      A few exhausted matrons sat in the robing-room, tired, sad, wishing Jane
      would come up; assailed at intervals by a vague suspicion that it was not
      quite worth while; wondering how it was they used to have such good times
      at balls; yawning and looking at their watches; while the regular beat of
      the music below, with sardonic sadness, continued. At last Jane came up,
      had had the most glorious time, and went down with mamma to the carriage,
      and so drove home. Even the last Jane went&mdash;the last noisy youth was
      expelled, and Mr. and Mrs. Potiphar having duly performed their biennial
      social duty, dismissed the music, ordered the servants to count the
      spoons, and an hour or two after daylight went to bed. Enviable Mr. and
      Mrs. Potiphar!
    </p>
    <p>
      We are now prepared for the great moral indignation of the friend who saw
      us eating our <i>dinde aux truffes</i> in that remarkable supper-room. We
      are waiting to hear him say in the most moderate and "gentlemanly" manner,
      that it is all very well to select flaws and present them as specimens,
      and to learn from him, possibly with indignant publicity, that the present
      condition of parties is not what we have intimated. Or, in his quiet and
      pointed way, he may smile at our fiery assault upon edged flounces and
      nuga pyramids, and the kingdom of Lilliput in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, after all, and despite the youths who are led out, and carried home,
      or who stumble through the "German," this is a sober matter. My friend
      told us we should see the "best society." But he is a prodigious wag. Who
      make this country? From whom is its character of unparalleled enterprise,
      heroism and success derived? Who have given it its place in the respect
      and the fear of the world? Who, annually, recruit its energies, confirm
      its progress, and secure its triumph? Who are its characteristic children,
      the pith, the sinew, the bone, of its prosperity? Who found, and direct,
      and continue its manifold institutions of mercy and education? Who are,
      essentially, Americans? Indignant friend, these classes, whoever they may
      be, are the "best society," because they alone are the representatives of
      its character and cultivation. They are the "best society" of New York, of
      Boston, of Baltimore, of St. Louis, of New Orleans, whether they live upon
      six hundred or sixty thousand dollars a year&mdash;whether they inhabit
      princely houses in fashionable streets (which they often do), or not&mdash;whether
      their sons have graduated at Celarius' and the <i>Jardin Mabille</i>, or
      have never been out of their fathers' shops&mdash;whether they have "air"
      and "style," and are "so gentlemanly" and "so aristocratic," or not. Your
      shoemaker, your lawyer, your butcher, your clergyman&mdash;if they are
      simple and steady, and, whether rich or poor, are unseduced by the sirens
      of extravagance and ruinous display, help make up the "best society." For
      that mystic communion is not composed of the rich, but of the worthy; and
      is "best" by its virtues, and not by its vices. When Johnson, Burke,
      Goldsmith, Garrick, Reynolds, and their friends, met at supper in
      Goldsmith's rooms, where was the "best society" in England? When George
      the Fourth outraged humanity and decency in his treatment of Queen
      Caroline, who was the first scoundrel in Europe?
    </p>
    <p>
      Pause yet a moment, indignant friend. Whose habits and principles would
      ruin this country as rapidly as it has been made? Who are enamored of a
      puerile imitation of foreign splendors? Who strenuously endeavor to graft
      the questionable points of Parisian society upon our own? Who pass a few
      years in Europe, and return skeptical of republicanism and human
      improvement, longing and sighing for more sharply emphasised social
      distinctions? Who squander with profuse recklessness the hard-earned
      fortunes of their sires? Who diligently devote their time to nothing,
      foolishly and wrongly supposing that a young English nobleman has nothing
      to do? Who, in fine, evince by their collective conduct, that they regard
      their Americanism as a misfortune, and are so the most deadly enemies of
      their country? None but what our wag facetiously termed "the best
      society."
    </p>
    <p>
      If the reader doubts, let him consider its practical results in any great
      emporium of "best society." Marriage is there regarded as a luxury, too
      expensive for any but the sons of rich men, or fortunate young men. We
      once heard an eminent divine assert, and only half in sport, that the rate
      of living was advancing so incredibly, that weddings in his experience
      were perceptibly diminishing. The reasons might have been many and
      various. But we all acknowledge the fact. On the other hand, and about the
      same time, a lovely damsel (ah! Clorinda,) whose father was not wealthy,
      who had no prospective means of support, who could do nothing but polka to
      perfection, who literally knew almost nothing, and who constantly shocked
      every fairly intelligent person by the glaring ignorance betrayed in her
      remarks, informed a friend at one of the Saratoga balls, whither he had
      made haste to meet "the best society," that there were "not more than
      three good matches in society!" <i>La Dame aux Camélias</i>, Marie
      Duplessis, was, to our fancy, a much more feminine, and admirable, and
      moral, and human person, than the adored Clorinda. And yet what she said
      was the legitimate result of the state of our fashionable society. It
      worships wealth, and the pomp which wealth can purchase, more than virtue,
      genius, or beauty. We may be told that it has always been so in every
      country, and that the fine society of all lands is as profuse and flashy
      as our own. We deny it, flatly. Neither English, nor French, nor Italian,
      nor German society, is so unspeakably barren as that which is technically
      called "society" here. In London, and Paris, and Vienna, and Rome, all the
      really eminent men and women help make up the mass of society. A party is
      not a mere ball, but it is a congress of the wit, beauty, and fame of the
      capital. It is worth while to dress, if you shall meet Macaulay, or
      Hallam, or Guizot, or Thiers, or Landseer, or Delaroche,&mdash;Mrs.
      Norton, the Misses Berry, Madame Recamier, and all the brilliant women and
      famous foreigners. But why should we desert the pleasant pages of those
      men, and the recorded gossip of those women, to be squeezed flat against a
      wall, while young Doughface pours oyster gravy down our shirt front, and
      Carolina Pettitoes wonders at "Mr. Düsseldorf's" industry?
    </p>
    <p>
      If intelligent people decline to go, you justly remark, it is their own
      fault. Yes, but if they stay away it is very certainly their great gain.
      The elderly people are always neglected with us, and nothing surprises
      intelligent strangers more, than the tyrannical supremacy of Young
      America. But we are not surprised at this neglect. How can we be if we
      have our eyes open? When Caroline Pettitoes retreats from the floor to the
      sofa, and instead of a "polker" figures at parties as a matron, do you
      suppose that "tough old Joes" like ourselves are going to desert the young
      Caroline upon the floor, for Madame Pettitoes upon the sofa? If the pretty
      young Caroline, with youth, health, freshness, a fine, budding form, and
      wreathed in a semi-transparent haze of flounced and flowered gauze, is so
      vapid that we prefer to accost her with our eyes alone, and not with our
      tongues, is the same Caroline married into a Madame Pettitoes, and fanning
      herself upon a sofa,&mdash;no longer particularly fresh, nor young, nor
      pretty, and no longer budding but very fully blown,&mdash;likely to be
      fascinating in conversation? We cannot wonder that the whole connection of
      Pettitoes, when advanced to the matron state, is entirely neglected.
      Proper homage to age we can all pay at home, to our parents and
      grandparents. Proper respect for some persons is best preserved by
      avoiding their neighborhood.

    <p>
      And what, think you, is the influence of this extravagant expense and
      senseless show upon these same young men and women? We can easily
      discover. It saps their noble ambition, assails their health, lowers their
      estimate of men and their reverence for women, cherishes an eager and
      aimless rivalry, weakens true feeling, wipes away the bloom of true
      modesty, and induces an ennui, a satiety, and a kind of dilettante
      misanthropy, which is only the more monstrous because it is undoubtedly
      real. You shall hear young men of intelligence and cultivation, to whom
      the unprecedented circumstances of this country offer opportunities of a
      great and beneficent career, complaining that they were born within this
      blighted circle&mdash;regretting that they were not bakers and
      tallow-chandlers, and under no obligation to keep up appearances&mdash;deliberately
      surrendering all the golden possibilities of that Future which this
      country, beyond all others, holds before them&mdash;sighing that they are
      not rich enough to marry the girls they love, and bitterly upbraiding
      fortune that they are not millionnaires&mdash;suffering the vigor of their
      years to exhale in idle wishes and pointless regrets&mdash;disgracing
      their manhood by lying in wait behind their "so gentlemanly" and
      "aristocratic" manners, until they can pounce upon a "fortune" and ensnare
      an heiress into matrimony: and so having dragged their gifts, their horses
      of the sun, into a service which shames out of them all their native pride
      and power, they sink in the mire, and their peers and emulators exclaim
      that they have "made a good thing of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Are these the processes by which a noble race is made and perpetuated? At
      Mrs. Potiphar's we heard several Pendennises longing for a similar luxury,
      and announcing their firm purpose, never to have wives, nor houses, until
      they could have them as splendid as jewelled Mrs. Potiphar, and her
      palace, thirty feet front. Where were their heads and their hearts, and
      their arms? How looks this craven despondency, before the stern virtues of
      the ages we call dark? When a man is so voluntarily imbecile as to regret
      he is not rich, if that is what he wants, before he has struck a blow for
      wealth; or so dastardly as to renounce the prospect of love, because
      sitting sighing, in velvet dressing-gown and slippers, he does not see his
      way clear to ten thousand a year; when young women coiffed <i>à merveille</i>,
      of unexceptionable "style," who, with or without a prospective penny,
      secretly look down upon honest women who struggle for their livelihood,
      like noble and Christian beings, and, as such, are rewarded; in whose
      society a man must forget that he has ever read, thought or felt; who
      destroy in the mind, the fair ideal of woman, which the genius of art and
      poetry, and love, their inspirer, has created; then it seems to us, it is
      high time that the subject should be regarded not as a matter of breaking
      butterflies upon the wheel, but as a sad and sober question, in whose
      solution, all fathers and mothers, and the state itself, are interested.
      When keen observers, and men of the world, from Europe, are amazed and
      appalled at the giddy whirl and frenzied rush of our society&mdash;a
      society singular in history, for the exaggerated prominence it assigns to
      wealth, irrespective of the talents that amassed it, they and their
      possessor being usually hustled out of sight&mdash;is it not quite time to
      ponder a little upon the Court of Louis XIV., and the "merrie days" of
      King Charles II.? Is it not clear that, if what our good wag, with caustic
      irony, called "best society," were really such, every thoughtful man would
      read upon Mrs. Potiphar's softly-tinted walls, the terrible "mene, mene"
      of imminent destruction?
    </p>
    <p>
      Venice in her purple prime of luxury, when the famous law was passed,
      making all gondolas black, that the nobles should not squander fortunes
      upon them, was not more luxurious than New York today. Our hotels have a
      superficial splendor, derived from a profusion of gilt and paint, wood and
      damask. Yet, in not one of them can the traveller be so quietly
      comfortable as in an English Inn, and nowhere in New York can the stranger
      procure a dinner, at once so neat and elegant, and economical, as at
      scores of Cafes in Paris. The fever of display has consumed comfort. A
      gondola plated with gold was no easier than a black wooden one. We could
      well spare a little gilt upon the walls, for more cleanliness upon the
      public table; nor is it worth while to cover the walls with mirrors to
      reflect a want of comfort, One prefers a wooden bench to a greasy velvet
      cushion, and a sanded floor to a soiled and threadbare carpet. An insipid
      uniformity is the Procrustes-bed, upon which "society" is stretched. Every
      new house is the counterpart of every other, with the exception of more
      gilt, if the owner can afford it. The interior arrangement, instead of
      being characteristic, instead of revealing something of the tastes and
      feelings of the owner, is rigorously conformed to every other interior.
      The same hollow and tame complaisance rules in the intercourse of society.
      Who dares say precisely what he thinks upon a great topic? What youth
      ventures to say sharp things, of slavery, for instance, at a polite
      dinner-table? What girl dares wear curls, when Martelle prescribes puffs
      or bandeaux? What specimen of young America dares have his trowsers loose
      or wear straps to them? We want individuality, heroism, and, if necessary,
      an uncompromising persistence in difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the present state of parties. They are wildly extravagant, full of
      senseless display; they are avoided by the pleasant and intelligent, and
      swarm with reckless regiments of "Brown's men." The ends of the earth
      contribute their choicest products to the supper, and there is everything
      that wealth can purchase, and all the spacious splendor that thirty feet
      front can afford. They are hot, and crowded, and glaring. There is a
      little weak scandal, venomous, not witty, and a stream of weary platitude,
      mortifying to every sensible person. Will any of our Pendennis friends
      intermit their indignation for a moment, and consider how many good things
      they have said or heard during the season? If Mr. Potiphar's eyes should
      chance to fall here, will he reckon the amount of satisfaction and
      enjoyment he derived from Mrs. Potiphar's ball, and will that lady
      candidly confess what she gained from it besides weariness and disgust?
      What eloquent sermons we remember to have heard in which the sins and the
      sinners of Babylon, Jericho and Gomorrah were scathed with holy
      indignation. The cloth is very hard upon Cain, and completely routs the
      erring kings of Judah. The Spanish Inquisition, too, gets frightful
      knocks, and there is much eloquent exhortation to preach the gospel in the
      interior of Siam. Let it be preached there, and God speed the word. But
      also let us have a text or two in Broadway and the Avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best sermon ever preached upon society, within our knowledge, is
      "Vanity Fair." Is the spirit of that story less true of New York than of
      London? Probably we never see Amelia at our parties, nor Lieutenant George
      Osborne, nor good gawky Dobbin, nor Mrs. Rebecca Sharp Crawley, nor old
      Steyne. We are very much pained, of course, that any author should take
      such dreary views of human nature. We, for our parts, all go to Mrs.
      Potiphar's to refresh our faith in men and women. Generosity, amiability,
      a catholic charity, simplicity, taste, sense, high cultivation, and
      intelligence, distinguish our parties. The statesman seeks their
      stimulating influence; the literary man, after the day's labour, desires
      the repose of their elegant conversation; the professional man and the
      merchant hurry up from down town to shuffle off the coil of heavy duty,
      and forget the drudgery of life in the agreeable picture of its amenities
      and graces presented by Mrs. Potiphar's ball. Is this account of the
      matter, or "Vanity Fair," the satire? What are the prospects of any
      society of which that tale is the true history? There is a picture in the
      Luxembourg gallery at Paris, "The Decadence of the Romans," which made the
      fame and fortune of Couture, the painter. It represents an orgie in the
      court of a temple, during the last days of Rome. A swarm of revellers
      occupy the middle of the picture, wreathed in elaborate intricacy of
      luxurious posture, men and women intermingled; their faces, in which the
      old Roman fire scarcely flickers, brutalized with excess of every kind;
      their heads of dishevelled hair bound with coronals of leaves, while, from
      goblets of an antique grace, they drain the fiery torrent which is
      destroying them. Around the bacchanalian feast stand, lofty upon
      pedestals, the statues of old Rome, looking with marble calmness and the
      severity of a rebuke beyond words upon the revellers. A youth of boyish
      grace, with a wreath woven in his tangled hair, and with red and drowsy
      eyes, sits listless upon one pedestal, while upon another stands a boy,
      insane with drunkenness, and proffering a dripping goblet to the marble
      mouth of the statue. In the corner of the picture, as if just quitting the
      court&mdash;Rome finally departing&mdash;is a group of Romans with
      care-worn brows, and hands raised to their faces in melancholy meditation.
      In the foreground of the picture, which is painted with all the sumptuous
      splendor of Venetian art, is a stately vase, around which hangs a festoon
      of gorgeous flowers, its end dragging upon the pavement. In the
      background, between the columns, smiles the blue sky of Italy&mdash;the
      only thing Italian not deteriorated by time. The careful student of this
      picture, if he has been long in Paris, is some day startled by detecting,
      especially in the faces of the women represented, a surprising likeness to
      the women of Paris, and perceives, with a thrill of dismay, that the
      models for this picture of decadent human nature are furnished by the very
      city in which he lives.

      II. &mdash; OUR NEW LIVERY, AND OTHER THINGS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A LETTER FROM MRS. POTIPHAR TO MISS CAROLINE PETTITOES.
    </p>
    <p>
      NEW YORK, <i>April.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      MY DEAR CAROLINE,&mdash;Lent came so frightfully early this year, that I
      was very much afraid my new bonnet <i>à l'Imperatrice</i> would not be out
      from Paris soon enough. But fortunately it arrived just in time, and I had
      the satisfaction of taking down the pride of Mrs. Croesus, who fancied
      hers would be the only stylish hat in church the first Sunday. She could
      not keep her eyes away from me, and I sat so unmoved, and so calmly
      looking at the Doctor, that she was quite vexed. But, whenever she turned
      away, I ran my eyes over the whole congregation, and would you believe
      that, almost without an exception, people had their old things? However, I
      suppose they forgot how soon Lent was coming. As I was passing out of
      church, Mrs. Croesus brushed by me:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said she, "good morning. Why bless me! you've got that pretty hat I
      saw at Lawson's. Well, now, it's really quite pretty; Lawson has some
      taste left yet; what a lovely sermon the Doctor gave us. By the by, did
      you know that Mrs. Gnu had actually bought the blue velvet? It's too bad,
      because I wanted to cover my prayer-book with blue, and she sits so near,
      the effect of my book will be quite spoiled. Dear me! there she is
      beckoning to me; good-bye, do come and see us; Tuesdays, you know. Well,
      Lawson really does very well."
    </p>
    <p>
      I was so mad with the old thing, that I could not help catching her by her
      mantle and holding on while I whispered loud enough for everybody to hear:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Croesus, you see I have just got my bonnet from Paris. It's made
      after the Empress's. If you would like to have yours made over in the
      fashion, dear Mrs. Croesus, I shall be so glad to lend you mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, thank you, dear," said she, "Lawson won't do for me. Bye-bye."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so she slipped out, and, I've no doubt, told Mrs. Gnu that she had
      seen my bonnet at Lawson's. Isn't it too bad? Then she is so abominably
      cool. Somehow, when I am talking with Mrs. Croesus, who has all her own
      things made at home, I don't feel as if mine came from Paris at all. She
      has such a way of looking at you, that it's quite dreadful. She seems to
      be saying in her mind, "La! now, well done, little dear." And I think that
      kind of mental reservation (I think that's what they call it) is an
      insupportable impertinence. However, I don't care, do you?
    </p>
    <p>
      I've so many things to tell you that I hardly know where to begin. The
      great thing is the livery, but I want to come regularly up to that, and
      forget nothing by the way. I was uncertain for a long time how to have my
      prayer-book bound. Finally, after thinking about it a great deal, I
      concluded to have it done in pale blue velvet, with gold clasps, and a
      gold cross upon the side. To be sure, it's nothing very new. But what <i>is</i>
      new now-a-days? Sally Shrimp has had hers done in emerald, and I know Mrs.
      Croesus will have crimson for hers, and those people who sits next us in
      church (I wonder who they are; it's very unpleasant to sit next to people
      you don't know; and, positively, that girl, the dark-haired one with large
      eyes, carries the same muff she did last year; it's big enough for a
      family) have a kind of brown morocco binding. I must tell you one reason
      why I fixed upon the pale-blue. You know that aristocratic-looking young
      man, in white cravat and black pantaloons and waistcoat, whom we saw at
      Saratoga a year ago, and who always had such a beautiful sanctimonious
      look, and such small white hands; well, he is a minister, as we supposed,
      "an unworthy candidate, and unprofitable husbandman," as he calls himself
      in that delicious voice of his. He has been quite taken up among us. He
      has been asked a good deal to dinner, and there was hope of his being
      settled as colleague to the Doctor, only Mr. Potiphar (who can be
      stubborn, you know) insisted that the Rev. Cream Cheese, though a very
      good young man, he didn't doubt, was addicted to candlesticks. I suppose
      that's something awful. But, could you believe anything awful of him? I
      asked Mr. Potiphar what he meant by saying such things.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean," said he, "that he's a Puseyite, and I've no idea of being tied
      to the apron-strings of the Scarlet Woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Caroline, who <i>is</i> the Scarlet Woman? Dearest, tell me, upon
      your honor, if you have ever heard any scandal of Mr. Potiphar?
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it about candlesticks?" said I to Mr. Potiphar. "Perhaps Mr.
      Cheese finds gas too bright for his eyes; and that's his misfortune, not
      his fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Polly," said Mr. Potiphar, who <i>will</i> call me Polly, although it
      sounds so very vulgar, "please not to meddle with things you don't
      understand. You may have Cream Cheese to dinner as much as you choose, but
      I will not have him in the pulpit of my church."
    </p>
    <p>
      The same day Mr. Cheese happened in about lunch-time, and I asked him if
      his eyes were really weak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all," said he, "why do you ask?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I told him that I had heard he was so fond of candlesticks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! Caroline, you should have seen him then. He stopped in the midst of
      pouring out a glass of Mr. P.'s best old port, and holding the decanter in
      one hand, and the glass in the other, he looked so beautifully sad, and
      said in that sweet low voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Mrs. Potiphar, the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church."
      Then he filled up his glass, and drank the wine off with such a mournful,
      resigned air, and wiped his lips so gently with his cambric handkerchief
      (I saw that it was a hem-stitch), that I had no voice to ask him to take a
      bit of the cold chicken, which he did, however, without my asking him. But
      when he said in the same low voice, "A little more breast, dear Mrs.
      Potiphar," I was obliged to run into the drawing room for a moment, to
      recover myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, after he had lunched I told him that I wished to take his advice
      upon something connected with the church, (for a prayer-book <i>is,</i>
      you know, dear,) and he looked so sweetly at me, that, would you believe
      it, I almost wished to be a Catholic, and to confess three or four times a
      week, and to have him for my confessor. But it's very wicked to wish to be
      a Catholic, and it wasn't real much, you know; but somehow I thought so.
      When I asked him in what velvet he would advise me to have my prayer-book
      bound, he talked beautifully for about twenty minutes. I wish you could
      have heard him. I'm not sure that I understood much of what he said&mdash;how
      should I?&mdash;but it was very beautiful. Don't laugh, Carrie, but there
      was one thing I did understand, and which, as it came pretty often, quite
      helped me through: it was, "Dear Mrs. Potiphar;" you can't tell how nicely
      he says it. He began by telling me that it was very important to consider
      all the details and little things about the church. He said they were all
      Timbales or Cymbals&mdash;or something of that kind; and then he talked
      very prettily about the stole, and the violet and scarlet capes of the
      cardinals, and purple chasubles, and the lace edge of the Pope's little
      short gown; and&mdash;do you know it was very funny&mdash;but it seemed to
      me, somehow, as if I was talking with Portier or Florine Lefevre, except
      that he used such beautiful words. Well, by and by, he said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Therefore, dear Mrs. Potiphar, as your faith is so pure and childlike,
      and as I observe that the light from the yellow panes usually falls across
      your pew, I would advise that you cymbalize your faith (wouldn't that be
      noisy in church?) by binding your prayer-book in pale blue; the color of
      skim-milk, dear Mrs. Potiphar, which is so full of pastoral associations."
    </p>
    <p>
      Why did he emphasize the word "pastoral?" Do you wonder that I like Cream
      Cheese, dear Caroline, when he is so gentle and religious&mdash;and such a
      pretty religion too! For he is not only well-dressed, and has such
      aristocratic hands and feet, in the parlor, but he is so perfectly
      gentlemanly in the pulpit. He never raises his voice too loud, and he has
      such wavy gestures. Mr. Potiphar says that may be all very true, but he
      knows perfectly well that he has a hankering for artificial flowers, and
      that, for his part, he prefers the Doctor to any preacher he ever heard
      "because," he says, "I can go quietly to sleep, confident that he will say
      nothing that might not be preached from every well-regulated pulpit;
      whereas, if we should let Cream Cheese into the desk, I should have to
      keep awake to be on the look-out for some of these new-fangled idolatries:
      and, Polly Potiphar, I, for one, am determined to have nothing to do with
      the Scarlet Woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Darling Caroline&mdash;I don't care much&mdash;but did he ever have
      anything to do with a Scarlet Woman?
    </p>
    <p>
      After he said that about artificial flowers, I ordered from Martelle the
      sweetest sprig of <i>immortelle</i> he had in his shop, and sent it
      anonymously on St. Valentine's day. Of course I didn't wish to do anything
      secret from my husband, that might make people talk, so I wrote&mdash;"Rev.
      Cream Cheese; from his grateful <i>Skim-milk.</i>" I marked the last
      words, and hope he understood that I meant to express my thanks for his
      advice about the pale-blue cover. You don't think it was too romantice, do
      you, dear?
    </p>
    <p>
      You can imagine how pleasantly Lent is passing since I see so much of him:
      and then it is so appropriate to Lent to be intimate with a minister. He
      goes with me to church a great deal; for Mr. Potiphar, of course, has no
      time for that, except on Sundays; and it is really delightful to see such
      piety. He makes the responses in the most musical manner; and when he
      kneels upon entering the pew, he is the admiration of the whole church. He
      buries his face entirely in a cloud of cambric pocket-handkerchief, with
      his initial embroidered at the corner; and his hair is beautifully parted
      down behind, which is very fortunate, as otherwise it would look so badly,
      when only half his head showed. I feel <i>so</i> good when I sit by his
      side; and when the Doctor (as Mr. P. says) "blows up" those terrible
      sinners in Babylon and the other Bible towns, I always find the Rev.
      Cream's eyes fixed upon me, with so much sweet sadness, that I am very,
      very sorry for the naughty people the Doctor talks about. Why did they do
      so, do you suppose, dear Caroline? How thankful we ought to be that we
      live now with so many churches, and such fine ones, and with such
      gentlemanly ministers as Mr. Cheese. And how nicely it's arranged that,
      after dancing and dining for two or three months constantly, during which,
      of course, we can only go to church Sundays, there comes a time for
      stopping, when we're tired out, and for going to church every day, and (as
      Mr. P. says) "striking a balance;" and thinking about being good, and all
      those things. We don't lose a great deal, you know. It makes a variety,
      and we all see each other, just the same, only we don't dance. I do think
      it would be better if we took our lorgnettes with us, however, for it was
      only last Wednesday, at nine o'clock prayers, that I saw Sheena Silke
      across the church in their little pew at the corner, and I am sure that
      she had a new bonnet on; and yet, though I looked at it all the time
      trying to find out, prayers were fairly over before I discovered whether
      it was really new, or only that old white one made over with a few new
      flowers. Now, if I had had my glass, I could have told in a moment, and
      shouldn't have been obliged to lose all the prayers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as I was saying, those poor old people in Babylon and Nineveh! only
      think, if they had had the privileges of prayers for six or seven weeks in
      Lent, and regular preaching the rest of the year, except, of course, in
      the summer&mdash;(by the by, I wonder if they all had some kind of
      Saratoga or Newport to go to?&mdash;I mean to ask Mr. Cheese)&mdash;they
      might have been good, and all have been happy. It's quite awful to hear
      how eloquent and earnest the Doctor is when he preaches against Babylon.
      Mr. P. says he likes to have him "pitch into those old sinners; it does
      'em so much good;" and then he looks quite fierce. Mr. Cheese is going to
      read me a sermon he has written upon the maidenhood of Lot's wife. He says
      that he quotes a great deal of poetry in it, and that I must <i>dam</i> up
      the fount of my tears when he reads it. It was an odd expression for a
      minister, wasn't it? and I was obliged to say, "Mr. Cheese, you forget
      yourself." He replied, "Dear Mrs. Potiphar, I will explain;" and he did
      so; so that I admired him more than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dearest Caroline,&mdash;if you should only like him! He asked one day
      about you; and when I told him what a dear, good girl you are, he said:
      "And her father has worldly possessions, has he not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I answered, yes; that your father was very rich. Then he sighed, and said
      that he could never marry an heiress unless he clearly saw it to be his
      duty. Isn't it a beautiful resignation?
    </p>
    <p>
      I had no idea of saying so much about him, but you know it's proper, when
      writing a letter in Lent, to talk about religious matters. And, I must
      confess, there is something comfortable in having to do with such things.
      Don't you feel better, when you've been dancing all the week, and dining,
      and going to the opera, and flirting and flying around, to go to church on
      Sundays? I do. It seems, somehow, as if we ought to go. But I do wish Mrs.
      Croesus would sit somewhere else than just in front of us, for her new
      bonnets and her splendid collars and capes makes me quite miserable: and
      then she puts me out of conceit of my things by talking about Lawson, or
      somebody, as I told you in the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Potiphar has sent out for the new carpets. I had only two spoiled at
      my ball, you know, and that was very little. One always expects to
      sacrifice at least two carpets upon occasion of seeing one's friends. That
      handsome one in the supper room was entirely ruined. Would you believe
      that Mr. P. when he went downstairs the next morning, found our Fred and
      his cousin hoeing it with their little toes? It was entirely matted with
      preserves and things, and the boys said that they were scraping it clean
      for breakfast. The other spoiled carpet was in the gentlemen's
      dressing-room where the punch-bowl was. Young Gauche Boosey, a very
      gentlemanly fellow, you know, ran up after polking, and was so confused
      with the light and heat that he went quite unsteadily, and as he was
      trying to fill a glass with the silver ladle (which is rather heavy), he
      somehow leaned too hard upon the table, and down went the whole thing,
      table, bowl, punch, and Boosey, and ended my poor carpet. I was sorry for
      that, and also for the bowl, which was a very handsome one, imported from
      China by my father's partner&mdash;a wedding gift to me&mdash;and for the
      table, a delicate rosewood stand, which was a work table of my sister
      Lucy's&mdash;whom you never knew, and who died long and long ago. However,
      I was amply repaid by Boosey's drollery afterward. He is a very witty
      young man, and when he got up from the floor, saturated with punch (his
      clothes I mean), he looked down at the carpet and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I've given that such a punch it will want some <i>lemon-aid</i> to
      recover."
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose he had some idea about lemon acid taking out spots.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, the best thing was what he said to me. He is so droll that he
      insisted upon coming down, and finishing the dance just as he was. The
      funny fellow brushed against all the dresses in his way, and, finally said
      to me, as he pointed to a lemon-seed upon his coat:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel so very <i>lemon-choly</i> for what I have done."
    </p>
    <p>
      I laughed very much (you were in the other room), but Mr. P. stepped up
      and ordered him to leave the house. Boosey said he would do no such thing;
      and I have no doubt we should have had a scene, if Mr. P. had not marched
      him straight to the door, and put him into a carriage, and told the driver
      where to take him. Mr. P. was red enough when he came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No man shall insult me or my guests, by getting drunk in my house," said
      he; and he has since asked me not to invite Boosey nor "any of his kind,"
      as he calls them, to our house. However, I think it will pass over. I tell
      him that all young men of spirit get a little excited with wine sometimes,
      and he mustn't be too hard upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame," said he to me, the first time I ventured to say that, "no man
      with genuine self-respect ever gets drunk twice; and, if you had the
      faintest idea of the misery which a little elegant intoxication has
      produced in scores of families that you know, you would never insinuate
      again that a little excitement from wine is an agreeable thing. There's
      your friend Mrs. Croesus (he thinks she's my friend, because we call each
      other 'dear'!); she is delighted to be a fashionable woman, and to be
      described as the 'peerless and accomplished Mrs. Croesus' in letters from
      the Watering-places to the Herald; but I tell you, if anything of the
      woman or the mother is left in the fashionable Mrs. Croesus, I could wring
      her heart as it never was wrung&mdash;and never shall be by me&mdash;by
      showing her the places that young Timon Croesus haunts, the people with
      whom he associates and the drunkenness, gambling, and worse dissipations
      of which he is guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Timon Croesus is eighteen or nineteen, or, perhaps, twenty years old; and
      Polly, I tell you, he is actually <i>blasé</i>, worn out with dissipation,
      the companion of blacklegs, the chevalier of Cyprians, tipsy every night,
      and haggard every morning. Timon Croesus is the puny caricature of a man,
      mentally, morally, and physically. He gets 'elegantly intoxicated' at your
      parties; he goes off to sup with Gauche Boosey; you and Mrs. Croesus think
      them young men of spirit,&mdash;it is an exhilarating case of sowing
      wildcats, you fancy,&mdash;and, when, at twenty-five, Timon Croesus stands
      ruined in the world, without aims or capacities, without the esteem of a
      single man or his own self-respect&mdash;youth, health, hope, and energy,
      all gone forever&mdash;then you and your dear Mrs. Croesus will probably
      wonder at the horrible harvest. Mrs. Potiphar, ask the Rev. Cream Cheese
      to omit his sermon upon the maidenhood of Lot's wife, and preach from this
      text: 'They that sow the wind shall reap the whirlwind.' Good heavens!
      Polly, fancy our Fred growing up to such a life! I'd rather bury him
      to-morrow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      I never saw Mr. P. so much excited. He fairly put his handkerchief to his
      eyes, and I really believe he cried! But I think he exaggerates these
      things: and as he had a very dear friend that went worse and worse, until
      he died frightfully, a drunkard, it is not strange he should speak so
      warmly about it. But as Mrs. Croesus says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can you do? You can't curb these boys, you don't want to break their
      spirits, you don't want to make them milk-sops."
    </p>
    <p>
      When I repeated this speech to Mr. P., he said to me with a kind of
      solemnity:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell Mrs. Croesus that I am not here to judge nor dictate: but she may be
      well assured, that every parent is responsible for every child of his to
      the utmost of the influence he can exert, whether he chooses to consider
      himself so or not; and if not now, in this world, yet somewhere and
      somehow, he must hear and heed the voice that called to Cain in the
      garden, 'Where is Abel, thy brother?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      I can't bear to hear Mr.P. talk in that way; it sounds so like preaching.
      Not precisely like what I hear at church but like what we mean when we say
      "preaching," without referring to any particular sermon. However, he
      grants that young Timon is an extreme case: but, he says, it is the result
      that proves the principle, and a state of feeling which not only allows,
      but indirectly fosters, that result, is frightful to think of.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't think of it then, Mr. P.," said I. He looked at me for a moment
      with the sternest scowl I ever saw upon a man's face, then he suddenly ran
      up to me, and kissed me on the forehead (although my hair was all dressed
      for Mrs. Gnu's dinner), and went out of the house. He hasn't said much to
      me since, but he speaks very gently when he does speak, and sometimes I
      catch him looking at me in such a singular way, so half mournful, that Mr.
      Cheese's eyes don't seem so very sad after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, to return to the party, I believe nothing else was injured except
      the curtains in the front drawing-room, which were so smeared with
      ice-cream and oyster gravy, that we must get new ones; and the cover of my
      porcelain tureen was broken by the servant, though the man said he didn't
      really mean to do it, and I could say nothing; and a party of young men,
      after the German Cotillion, did let fall that superb cut-glass Claret, and
      shivered it, with a dozen of the delicately engraved straw-stems that
      stood upon the waiter. That was all, I believe&mdash;oh! except that fine
      "Dresden Gallery," the most splendid book I ever saw, full of engravings
      of the great pictures in Dresden, Vienna, and the other Italian towns, and
      which was sent to Mr. P. by an old friend, an artist, whom he had helped
      along when he was very poor. Somebody unfortunately tipped over a bottle
      of claret that stood upon the table, (I am sure I don't know how it got
      there, though Mr. P. says Gauche Boosey knows,) and it lay soaking into
      the book, so that almost every picture has a claret stain, which looks so
      funny. I am very sorry, I am sure, but as I tell Mr. P., it's no use
      crying for spilt milk. I was telling Mr. Boosey of it at the Gnus' dinner.
      He laughed very much, and when I said that a good many of the faces were
      sadly stained, he said in his droll way, "You ought to call it <i>L'Opera
      di Bordeaux; Le Domino rouge.</i>" I supposed it was something funny, so I
      laughed a good deal. He said to me later: "Shall I pour a little claret
      into your book&mdash;I mean into your glass?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Wasn't it a pretty <i>bon-mot?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't you think we are getting very <i>spirituel</i> in this country?
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe there was nothing else injured except the bed-hangings in the
      back room, which were somehow badly burnt and very much torn in pulling
      down, and a few of our handsomest shades that were cracked by the heat,
      and a few plates, which it was hardly fair to expect wouldn't be broken,
      and the colored glass door in my <i>escritoire</i>, against which Flattie
      Podge fell as she was dancing with Gauche Boosey; but he may have been a
      little excited, you know, and she, poor girl, couldn't help tumbling, and
      as her head hit the glass, of course, it broke, and cut her head badly, so
      that the blood ran down and naturally spoiled her dress; and what little
      <i>escritoire</i> could stand against Flattie Podge? So that went, and was
      a good deal smashed in falling. That's all, I think, except that the next
      day Mrs. Croesus sent a note, saying that she had lost her largest diamond
      from her necklace, and she was sure that it was not in the carriage, nor
      in her own house, nor upon the sidewalk, for she had carefully looked
      everywhere, <i>and she would be very glad if I would return it by the
      bearer.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, we hunted everywhere, and found no diamond. I took particular pains
      to ask the servants if they had found it, for if they had, they might as
      well give it up at once, without expecting any reward from Mrs. Croesus,
      who wasn't very generous. But they all said they hadn't found any diamond:
      and our man John, who you know is so guileless,&mdash;although it <i>was</i>
      a little mysterious about that emerald pin of mine,&mdash;brought me a bit
      of glass that had been nicked out of my large custard dish, and asked me
      if that was not Mrs. Croesus's diamond. I told him no, and gave him a gold
      dollar for his honesty. John is an invaluable servant; he is so guileless.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Do you know I am not so sure about Mrs. Croesus's diamond!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. P. made a great howling about the ball. But it was very foolish, for
      he got safely to bed by six o'clock, and he need have no trouble about
      replacing the curtains, and glass, etc. I shall do all that, and the sum
      total will be sent to him in a lump, so that he can pay it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men are so unreasonable. Fancy us at seven o'clock that morning, when I
      retired. He wasn't asleep. But whose fault was that?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Polly," said he, "that's the last."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Last what?" said I. &mdash; "Last ball at my house," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fiddle-dee-dee," said I. &mdash; "I tell you, Mrs. Potiphar, I am not
      going to open my house for a crowd of people who don't go away till
      daylight; who spoil my books and furniture; involve me in a foolish
      expense; for a gang of rowdy boys, who drink my Margaux, and Lafitte, and
      Marcobrunner, (what kind of drinks are those, dear Caroline?) and who
      don't know Chambertin from liquorice-water,&mdash;for a swarm of persons
      few of whom we know fewer, still care for me, and to whom I am only 'Old
      Potiphar,' the husband of you, a fashionable woman. I am simply resolved
      to have no more such tomfoolery in my house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Mr. P.," said I, "you'll feel much better when you have slept.
      Besides, why do you say such things? Mustn't we see our friends, I should
      like to know; and if we do, are you going to let your wife receive them in
      a manner inferior to old Mrs. Podge or Mrs. Croesus? People will accuse
      you of meanness, and of treating me ill; and if some persons hear that you
      have reduced your style of living, they will begin to suspect the state of
      your affairs. Don't make any rash vows, Mr. P.," said I, "but go to
      sleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      (Do you know that speech was just what Mrs. Croesus told me she had said
      to her husband under similar circumstances?)
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. P. fairly groaned, and I heard that short, strong little word that
      sometimes inadvertently drops out of the best regulated mouths, as young
      Gooseberry Downe says when he swears before his mother. Do you know Mrs.
      Settum Downe? Charming woman, but satirical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. P. groaned, and said some more ill-natured things, until the clock
      struck nine, and he was obliged to get up. I should be sorry to say to
      anybody but you, dearest, that I was rather glad of it; for I could then
      fall asleep at my ease; and these little connubial felicities (I think
      they call them) are so tiresome. But everybody agreed it was a beautiful
      ball; and I had the great gratification of hearing young Lord Mount Ague
      (you know you danced with him, love) say that it was quite the same thing
      as a ball at Buckingham Palace, except, of course, in size, and the number
      of persons, and dresses, and jewels, and the plate, and glass, and supper,
      and wines, and furnishing of the rooms, and lights, and some of those
      things, which are naturally upon a larger scale at a palace than in a
      private house. But, he said, excepting such things, it was quite as fine.
      I am afraid that Lord Mount Ague flatters; just a little bit you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes; and there was young Major Staggers, who said that "Decidedly it was
      <i>the</i> party of the season."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How odd," said Mrs. Croesus, to whom I told it, and, I confess, with a
      little pride. "What a sympathetic man: that is, for a military man, I
      mean. Would you believe, dear Mrs. Potiphar, that he said precisely the
      same thing to me two days after my ball?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Caroline, dearest, <i>perhaps</i> he did!
    </p>
    <p>
      With all these pleasant things said about one's party, I cannot see that
      it is such a dismal thing as Mr. P. tries to make out. After one of his
      solemn talks, I asked Mr. Cheese what he thought of balls, whether it was
      so very wicked to dance, and go to parties, if one only went to church
      twice a day on Sundays. He patted his lips a moment with his handkerchief,
      and then he said,&mdash;and, Caroline, you can always quote the Rev. Cream
      Cheese as authority,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Mrs. Potiphar, it is recorded in Holy Scripture that the King danced
      before the Lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      Darling, <i>if anything should happen,</i> I don't believe he would object
      much to our dancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      What gossips we women are, to be sure! I meant to write you about our new
      livery and I am afraid I have tired you out already. You remember when you
      were here, I said that I meant to have a livery, for my sister Margaret
      told me that when they used to drive in Hyde Park, with the old Marquis of
      Mammon, it was always so delightful to hear him say, "Ah! there is Lady
      Lobster's livery."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so aristocratic. And in countries where certain colors distinguish
      certain families, and are hereditary, so to say, it is convenient and
      pleasant to recognize a coat-of-arms, or a livery, and to know that the
      representative of a great and famous family is passing by.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a Howard, that's a Eussell, that's a Dorset, that's de Colique,
      that's Mount Ague," old Lord Mammon used to say as the carriages whirled
      by. He knew none of them personally, I believe, except de Colique and
      Mount Ague, but then it was so agreeable to be able to know their
      liveries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now why shouldn't we have the same arrangement? Why not have the Smith
      colors, and the Brown colors, and the Black colors, and the Potiphar
      colors, etc., so that the people might say, "Ah! there goes the Potiphar
      arms."
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one difficulty, Mr. P. says, and that is, that he found five
      hundred and sixty-seven Smiths in the Directory, which might lead to some
      confusion. But that was absurd, as I told him, because everybody would
      know which of the Smiths was able to keep a carriage, so that the livery
      would be recognized directly the moment that any of the family were seen
      in a carriage. Upon which he said, in his provoking way, "Why have any
      livery at all, then?" and he persisted in saying that no Smith was ever <i>the</i>
      Smith for three generations, and that he knew at least twenty, each of
      whom was able to set up his carriage and stand by his colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But then a livery is so elegant and aristocratic," said I, "and it shows
      that a servant is a servant."
    </p>
    <p>
      That last was a strong argument, and I thought Mr. P. would have nothing
      to say against it; but he rattled on for some time, asking me what right I
      had to be aristocratic, or, in fact, anybody else;&mdash;went over his
      eternal old talk about aping foreign habits, as if we hadn't a right to
      adopt the good usages of all nations, and finally said that the use of
      liveries among us was not only a "pure peacock absurdity," as he called
      it, but that no genuine American would ever ask another to assume a menial
      badge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why!" said I, "is not an American servant a servant still?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most undoubtedly," he said; "and when a man is a servant, let him serve
      faithfully; and in this country especially, where to-morrow he may be
      served, and not the servant, let him not be ashamed of serving. But, Mrs.
      Potiphar, I beg you to observe that a servant's livery is not, like a
      general's uniform the badge of honorable service, but of menial service.
      Of course, a servant may be as honorable as a general, and his work quite
      as necessary and well done. But, for all that, it is not so respected nor
      coveted a situation, I believe; and, in social estimation, a man suffers
      by wearing a livery, as he never would if he wore none. And while in
      countries in which a man is proud of being a servant (as every man may
      well be of being a good one), and never looks to anything else, nor
      desires any change, a livery may be very proper to the state of society,
      and very agreeable to his own feelings, it is quite another thing in a
      society constituted upon altogether different principles, where the
      servant of to-day is the senator of to-morrow. Besides that, which I
      suppose is too fine-spun for you, livery is a remnant of a feudal state,
      of which we abolish every trace as fast as we can. That which is
      represented by livery is not consonant with our principles."
    </p>
    <p>
      How the man runs on, when he gets going this way! I said, in answer to all
      this flourish, that I considered a livery very much the thing; that
      European families had liveries and American families might have liveries;&mdash;that
      there was an end of it, and I meant to have one. Besides if it is a matter
      of family, I should like to know who has a better right? There was Mr.
      Potiphar's grandfather, to be sure, was only a skilful blacksmith and a
      good citizen, as Mr. P. says, who brought up a family in the fear of the
      Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      How oddly he puts those things!
    </p>
    <p>
      But <i>my</i> ancestors, as you know, are a different matter. Starr Mole,
      who interests himself in genealogies, and knows the family name and crest
      of all the English nobility, has "climbed our family tree," as Staggers
      says, and finds that I am lineally descended from one of those two
      brothers who came over in some of those old times, in some of those old
      ships, and settled in some of those old places somewhere. So you see, dear
      Caroline, if birth gives any one a right to coats of arms and liveries,
      and all those things, I feel myself sufficiently entitled to have them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I don't care anything about that. The Gnus, and Croesuses, and Silkes,
      and the Settum Downes, have their coats of arms, and crests, and liveries,
      and I am not going to be behind, I tell you. Mr. P. ought to remember that
      a great many of these families were famous before they came to this
      country; and there is a kind of interest in having on your ring, for
      instance, the same crest that your ancestor two or three centuries ago had
      upon her ring. One day I was quite wrought up about the matter, and I said
      as much to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," said he, "certainly; you are quite right. If I had Sir Philip
      Sidney to my ancestor, I should wear his crest upon my ring, and glory in
      my relationship, and I hope I should be a better man for it. I wouldn't
      put his arms upon my carriage, however, because that would mean nothing
      but ostentation. It would be merely a flourish of trumpets to say that I
      was his descendant, and nobody would know that, either, if my name chanced
      to be Boggs. In my library I might hang a copy of the family escutcheon as
      a matter of interest and curiosity to myself, for I'm sure I shouldn't
      understand it. Do you suppose Mrs. Gnu knows what <i>gules argent</i> are?
      A man may be as proud of his family as he chooses, and, if he has noble
      ancestors, with good reason. But there is no sense in parading that pride.
      It is an affectation, the more foolish that it achieves nothing&mdash;no
      more credit at Stewart's&mdash;no more real respect in society. Besides,
      Polly, who were Mrs. Gnu's ancestors, or Mrs. Croesus's, or Mrs. Settum
      Downe's? Good, quiet, honest, and humble people, who did their work, and
      rest from their labors. Centuries ago, in England, some drops of blood
      from 'noble' veins may have mingled with the blood of the forefathers; or
      even, the founder of the family name may be historically famous. What
      then? Is Mrs. Gnu's family ostentation less absurd? Do you understand the
      meaning of her crest, and coats of arms, and liveries? Do you suppose she
      does herself? But in forty-nine cases out of fifty, there is nothing but a
      similarity of name upon which to found all this flourish of aristocracy."
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear old Pot is getting rather prosy, Carrie. So when he had finished
      that long speech, during which I was looking at the lovely fashion plates
      in Harper, I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What colors do you think I'd better have?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me with that singular expression, and went out suddenly, as
      if he were afraid he might say something.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had scarcely gone before I heard:
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Mrs. Potiphar, the sight of you is refreshing as Hermon's dew."
    </p>
    <p>
      I colored a little; Mr. Cheese says such things so softly. But I said good
      morning, and then asked him about liveries, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his hand to his cravat, (it was the most snowy lawn, Carrie, and
      tied in a splendid bow.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is not this a livery, dear Mrs. Potiphar?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he went off into one of those pretty talks, in what Mr. P. calls
      the "language of artificial flowers," and wound up by quoting Scripture,&mdash;"Servants,
      obey your masters."
    </p>
    <p>
      That was enough for me. So I told Mr. Cheese that as he had already
      assisted me in colors once, I should be most glad to have him do so again.
      What a time we had, to be sure, talking of colors, and cloths, and
      gaiters, and buttons, and knee-breeches, and waistcoats, and plush, and
      coats, and lace, and hatbands, and gloves, and cravats, and cords, and
      tassels, and hats. Oh! it was delightful. You can't fancy how heartily the
      Rev. Cream entered into the matter. He was quite enthusiastic, and at last
      he said, with so much expression, "Dear Mrs. Potiphar, why not have a <i>chasseur?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought it was some kind of French dish for lunch, so I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am so sorry, but we haven't any in the house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," said he, "but you could hire one, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I thought it must be a musical instrument&mdash;a Panharmonicon, or
      something of that kind, so I said in a general way&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not very, very fond of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it would be so fine to have him standing on the back of the carriage,
      his plumes waving in the wind, and his lace and polished belts flashing in
      the sun, as you whirled down Broadway."
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course I knew then that he was speaking of those military gentlemen who
      ride behind carriages, especially upon the Continent, as Margaret tells
      me, and who in Paris are very useful to keep the savages and wild beasts
      at bay in the <i>Champ Elysees</i>, for you know they are intended as a
      guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I knew Mr. P. would be firm about that, so I asked Mr. Cheese not to
      kindle my imagination with the <i>Chasseur</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We concluded finally to have only one full-sized footman, and a fat
      driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The corpulence is essential, dear Mrs. Potiphar," said Mr. Cheese. "I
      have been much abroad; I have mingled, I trust, in good, which is to say,
      Christian society: and I must say, that few things struck me more upon my
      return than that the ladies who drive very handsome carriages, with
      footmen, etc., in livery, should permit such thin coachmen upon the box. I
      really believe that Mrs. Settum Downe's coachman doesn't weigh more than a
      hundred and thirty pounds, which is ridiculous. A lady might as well hire
      a footman with insufficient calves, as a coachman who weighs less than two
      hundred and ten. That is the minimum. Besides, I don't observe any wigs
      upon the coachmen. Now, if a lady sets up her carriage with the family
      crest and fine liveries, why, I should like to know, is the wig of the
      coachman omitted, and his cocked hat also? It is a kind of shabby,
      half-ashamed way of doing things&mdash;a garbled glory. The cock-hatted,
      knee-breeched, paste-buckled, horse-hair-wigged coachman, one of the
      institutions of the aristocracy. If we don't have him complete, we somehow
      make ourselves ridiculous. If we do have him complete, why then"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Cheese coughed a little, and patted his mouth with his cambric.
      But what he said was very true. I <i>should</i> like to come out with the
      wig&mdash;I mean upon the coachman; it would so put down the Settum
      Downes. But I'm sure old Pot wouldn't have it. He lets me do a great deal.
      But there is a line which I feel he won't let me pass. I mentioned my
      fears to Mr. Cheese.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he said, "Mr. Potiphar may be right. I remember an expression of
      my carnal days about 'coming it too strong.' which seems to me to be
      applicable just here."
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little more talk, I determined to have red plush breeches, with a
      black cord at the side&mdash;white stockings&mdash;low shoes with large
      buckles&mdash;a yellow waistcoat, with large buttons&mdash;lappels to the
      pockets&mdash;and a purple coat, very full and fine, bound with gold lace&mdash;and
      the hat banded with a full gold rogette. Don't you think that would look
      well in Hyde Park? And, darling Carrie, why shouldn't we have in Broadway
      what they have in Hyde Park?
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. P. came in, I told him all about it. He laughed a good deal, and
      said, "What next?" So I am not sure that he would be so very hard upon the
      wig. The next morning I had appointed to see the new footman, and as Mr.
      P. went out he turned and said to me, "Is your footman coming to-day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said he, "don't forget the calves. You know that everything in the
      matter of livery depends upon the calves."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he went out laughing silently to himself, with&mdash;actually, Carrie&mdash;a
      tear in his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was true, wasn't it? I remember in all the books and pictures how
      much is said about the calves. In advertisements, etc., it is stated that
      none but well-developed calves need apply, at least it is so in England,
      and, if I have a livery, I am not going to stop half-way. My duty was very
      clear. When Mr. Cheese came in, I said I felt awkward in asking a servant
      about his calves,&mdash;it sounded so queerly. But I confessed that it was
      necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, the path of duty is not always smooth, dear Mrs. Potiphar. It is
      often thickly strewn with thorns," said he, as he sank back in the <i>fautteuil</i>,
      and put down his <i>petit verre of Marasquin</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just after he had gone the new footman was announced. I assure you,
      although it is ridiculous, I felt quite nervous. But when he came in, I
      said calmly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, James, I am glad you have come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please, ma'am, my name is Henry," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was astonished at his taking me up so, and said, decidedly&mdash;"James,
      the name of my footman is always James. You may call yourself what you
      please, I shall always call you James."
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of the man's undertaking to arrange my servants' names for me!
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, he showed me his references, which were very good, and I was quite
      satisfied. But there was the terrible calf business that must be attended
      to. I put it off a great while, but I had to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, James!"&mdash;and there I stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, ma'am," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish&mdash;yes&mdash;ah!"&mdash;and I stopped again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, ma'am," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "James, I wish you had come in knee-breeches."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ma'am?" said he in great surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In knee-breeches, James," repeated I. &mdash; "What be they, ma'am? what
      for, ma'am?" said he, a little frightened, as I thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! nothing, nothing; but&mdash;but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, ma'am," said James.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;but, I want to see&mdash;to see&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What ma'am?" said James.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your legs," gasped I; and the path <i>was</i> thorny enough, Carrie, I
      can tell you. I had a terrible time explaining to him what I meant, and
      all about the liveries, etc. Dear me! what a pity these things are not
      understood: and then we should never have this trouble about explanations.
      However, I couldn't make him agree to wear the livery. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll try to be a good servant, ma'am, but I cannot put on those things
      and make a fool of myself. I hope you won't insist, for I am very anxious
      to get a place."
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of his dictating to me. I told him that I did not permit my servants
      to impose conditions upon me (that's one of Mrs. Croesus's sayings), that
      I was willing to pay him good wages and treat him well, but that my James
      must wear my livery. He looked very sorry, said that he should like the
      place very much,&mdash;that he was satisfied with the wages, and was sure
      that he should please me, but he could not put on those things. We were
      both determined, and so parted. I think we were both sorry; for I should
      have to go all through the calf-business again, and he lost a good place.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Caroline dear, I have my livery and my footman, and am as good as
      anybody. It's very splendid when I go to Stewart's to have the red plush
      and the purple, and the white calves springing down to open the door, and
      to see people look, and say, "I wonder who that is?" And everybody bows so
      nicely, and the clerks are so polite, and Mrs. Gnu is melting with envy on
      the other side, and Mrs. Croesus goes about saying, "Dear little woman,
      that Mrs. Potiphar, but so weak! Pity, pity!" And Mrs. Settum Downe says,
      "Is that the Potiphar livery? Ah, yes, Mr. Potiphar's grandfather used to
      shoe my grandfather's horses!"&mdash;(as if to be useful in the world,
      were a disgrace,&mdash;as Mr. P. says) and young Downe, and Boosey, and
      Timon Croesus come up and stand about so gentlemanly, and say, "Well Mrs.
      Potiphar, are we to have no more charming parties this season?"&mdash;and
      Boosey says, in his droll way, "Let's keep the ball a-rolling!" That young
      man is always ready with a witticism. Then I step out and James throws
      open the door, and the young men raise their hats, and the new crowd says,
      "I wonder who that is!" and the plush and purple, and calves spring up
      behind, and I drive home to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Carrie, dear, isn't that nice?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I don't know how it is&mdash;but things are so queer. Sometimes when
      I wake up in the morning, in my room, which I have had tapestried with
      fluted rose silk, and lie thinking, under the lace curtains; although I
      may have been at one of Mrs. Gnu's splendid parties the night before, and
      am going to Mrs. Silke's to dinner, and to the opera and Mrs. Settum
      Downe's in the evening, and have nothing to do all the day but go to
      Stewart's, or Martelle's or Lefevre's, and shop, and pay morning calls;&mdash;do
      you know, as I say, that sometimes I hear an old familiar tune played upon
      a hand-organ far away in some street, and it seems to me in that
      half-drowsy state under the laces, that I hear the girls and boys singing
      it in the fields where we used to play. It is a kind of dream, I suppose,
      but often, as I listen, I am sure that I hear Henry's voice again that
      used to ring so gayly among the old trees, and I walk with him in the
      sunlight to the bank by the river, and he throws in the flower&mdash;as he
      really did&mdash;and says, with a laugh, "If it goes this side of the
      stump I am saved; if the other, I am lost;" and then he looks at me as if
      I had anything to do with it, and the flower drifts slowly off and off,
      and goes the other side of the old stump, and we walk homeward silently,
      until Henry laughs out, and says, "Thank heaven, my fate is not a flower;"
      and I swear to love him for ever and ever, and marry him, and live in a
      dingy little old room in some of the dark and dirty streets in the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I doze again: but presently the music steals into my sleep, and I see
      him as I saw him last standing in his pulpit, so calm and noble, and
      drawing the strong men as well as the weak women by his earnest
      persuasion; and after service he smiles upon me kindly, and says, "This is
      my wife, and the wife, who looks like the Madonna in that picture of
      Andrea Del Sarto's, which you liked so at the gallery, leads us to a
      little house buried in roses, looking upon a broad and lovely landscape,"
      and Henry whispers to me as a beautiful boy bounds into the room, "Mrs.
      Potiphar, I am very happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      I doze again until Adele comes in and opens the shutters. I do not hear
      the music any more; but those days I do somehow seem to hear it all the
      time. Of course, Mr. P. is gone long before I wake, so he knows nothing
      about all this. I generally come in at night after he is asleep, and he is
      up and has his breakfast, and goes down town before I wake in the morning.
      He comes home to dinner, but he is apt to be silent; and after dinner he
      takes his nap in the parlor over his newspaper, while I go up and let
      Adele dress my hair for the evening. Sometimes Mr. P. groans into a clean
      shirt and goes with me to the ball; but not often. When I come home, as I
      said, he is asleep, so I don't see a great deal of him, except in the
      summer, when I am at Saratoga or Newport; and then, not so much, after
      all, for he usually only passes Sunday, and I must be a good Christian,
      you know, and go to church. On the whole, we have not a very intimate
      acquaintance; but I have a great respect for him. He told me the other day
      that he should make at least thirty thousand dollars this year.
    </p>
    <p>
      My darling Carrie&mdash;I am very sorry I can't write you a longer letter.
      I want to consult you about wearing gold powder like the new Empress. It
      would kill Mrs. Croesus if you and I should be the first to come out in
      it; and don't you think the effect would be fine, when we were dancing, to
      shower the gold mist around us! How it would sparkle upon the gentlemen's
      black coats! ("Yes," says Mr. P., "and how finely Gauche Boosey, and Timon
      Croesus, and young Downe will look in silk tights and small clothes!")
      They say it's genuine gold ground up. I have already sent for a white
      velvet and lace&mdash;the Empress's bridal dress, you know. That foolish
      old P. asked me if I had sent for the Emperor and the Bank of France too.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Men ask such absurd questions," said I. &mdash; "Mrs. Potiphar, I never
      asked but one utterly absurd question in my life," said he, and marched
      out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Au revoir, chère Caroline</i>. I have a thousand things to say, but I
      know you must be tired to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fondly yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      POLLY POTIPHAR.
    </p>
    <p>
      P. S.&mdash;Our little Fred. is quite down with the scarlet fever.
      Potiphar says I mustn't expose myself, so I don't go into the room; but
      Mrs. Jollup, the nurse, tells me through the keyhole how he is. Mr. P.
      sleeps in the room next the nursery, so as not to carry the infection to
      me. He looks very solemn as he walks down town. I hope it won't spoil
      Fred's complexion. I should be so sorry to have him a little fright! Poor
      little thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      P. S. 2d.&mdash;Isn't it funny about the music?

    <h2>
      III. &mdash; A MEDITATION BY PAUL POTIPHAR, ESQ.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Well, my new house is finished&mdash;and so am I. I hope Mrs. Potiphar is
      satisfied. Everybody agrees that it is "palatial." The daily papers have
      had columns of description, and I am, evidently, according to their
      authority, "munificent," "tasteful," "enterprising," and "patriotic."
    </p>
    <p>
      Amen! but what business have I with palatial residences? What more can I
      possibly want, than a spacious, comfortable house? Do <i>I</i> want buhl
      <i>escritoires</i>? Do I want or <i>molu</i> things? Do I know anything
      about pictures and statues? In the name of heaven do I want rose-pink
      bed-curtains to give my grizzly old phiz a delicate "uroral hue," as Cream
      Cheese says of Mrs. P.'s complexion? Because I have made fifty thousand
      this last year in Timbuctoo bonds, must I convert it all into a house, so
      large that it will not hold me comfortably,&mdash;so splendid that I might
      as well live in a porcelain vase, for the trouble of taking care of it,&mdash;so
      prodigiously "palatial" that I have to skulk into my private room, put on
      my slippers, close the door, shut myself up with myself, and wonder why I
      married Mrs. Potiphar?
    </p>
    <p>
      This house is her doing. Before I married her, I would have worn yellow
      silk breeches on 'Change if she had commanded me&mdash;for love. Now I
      would build her two houses twice as large as this, if she required it&mdash;for
      peace. It's all over. When I came home from China I was the desirable Mr.
      Potiphar, and every evening was a field-day for me, in which I reviewed
      all the matrimonial forces. It is astonishing, now I come to think of it,
      how skilfully Brigadier-General Mrs. Pettitoes deployed those daughters of
      hers; how vigorously Mrs. Tabby led on her forlorn hope; and how
      unweariedly, Murat-like, Mrs. De Famille charged at the head of her
      cavalry. They deserve to be made Marshals of France, all of them. And I am
      sure, that if women ought ever to receive honorary testimonials, it is for
      having "married a daughter well."
    </p>
    <p>
      That's a pretty phrase! The mammas marry, the misses are married.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, I don't see why I say so. I fear I am getting sour. For
      certainly, Polly's mother didn't marry Polly to me. I fell in love with
      her, the rest followed. Old Gnu says that it's true Polly's mother didn't
      marry her, but she did marry herself, to me.

      "Do you really think, Paul Potiphar," said he, a few months ago, when I
      was troubled about Polly's getting a livery, "that your wife was in love
      with you, a dry old chip from China? Don't you hear her say whenever any
      of her friends are engaged, that they 'have done very well!' and made a
      'capital match!' and have you any doubt of her meaning? Don't you know
      that this is the only country in which the word 'money' must never be
      named in the young female ear; and in whose best society&mdash;not
      universally nor without exception, of course not; Paul, don't be a fool&mdash;money
      makes marriages? When you were engaged, 'the world' said that it was a
      'capital thing' for Polly. Did that mean that you were a good, generous,
      intelligent, friendly, and patient man, who would be the companion for
      life she ought to have? You know, as well as I do, and as all the people
      who said it know, that it meant you were worth a few hundred thousands,
      that you could build a splendid house, keep horses and chariots, and live
      in style. You and I are sensible men, Paul, and we take the world as we
      find it; and know that if a man wants a good dinner he must pay for it. We
      don't quarrel with this state of things. How can it be helped? But we need
      not virtuously pretend it's something else. When my wife, being then a gay
      girl, first smiled at me, and looked at me, and smelt at the flowers I
      sent her in an unutterable manner, and proved to me that she didn't love
      me by the efforts she made to show that she did, why, I was foolishly
      smitten with her, and married her. I knew that she did not marry me, but
      sundry shares in the Patagonia and Nova Zembla Consolidation, and a few
      hundred house lots upon the island. What then? I wanted her, she was
      willing to take me,&mdash;being sensible enough to know that the stock and
      the lots had an incumbrance. <i>Voila tout,</i> as young Boosey says. Your
      wife wants you to build a house. You'd better build it. It's the easiest
      way. Make up your mind to Mrs. Potiphar, my dear Paul, and thank heaven
      you've no daughters to be married off by that estimable woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Why does a man build a house? To live in, I suppose&mdash;to have a home.
      But is a fine house a home? I mean, is a "palatial residence," with Mrs.
      Potiphar at the head of it, the "home" of which we all dream more or less,
      and for which we ardently long as we grow older? A house, I take it, is a
      retreat to which a man hurries from business, and in which he is
      compensated by the tenderness and thoughtful regard of a woman, and the
      play of his children, for the rough rubs with men. I know it is a silly
      view of the case, but I'm getting old and can't help it. Mrs. Potiphar is
      perfectly right when she says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You men are intolerable. After attending to your own affairs all day, and
      being free from the fuss of housekeeping, you expect to come home and
      shuffle into your slippers, and snooze over the evening paper&mdash;if it
      were possible to snooze over the exciting and respectable evening journal
      you take&mdash;while we are to sew, and talk with you if you are
      talkative, and darn the stockings, and make tea. You come home tired, and
      likely enough, surly, and gloom about like a thundercloud if dinner isn't
      ready for you the instant you are ready for it, and then sit mum and eat
      it; and snap at the children, and show yourselves the selfish, ugly things
      you are. Am <i>I</i> to have no fun, never go to the opera, never go to a
      ball, never have a party at home? Men are tyrants, Mr. Potiphar. They are
      ogres who entice us poor girls into their castles, and then eat up our
      happiness and scold us while they eat."
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I suppose it is so. I suppose I am an ogre and enticed Polly into my
      castle. But she didn't find it large enough, and teased me to build
      another. I suppose she does sit with me in the evening, and sew, and make
      tea, and wait upon me. I suppose she does, but I've not a clear idea of
      it. I know it's unkind of me, when I have been hard at work all day,
      trying to make and secure the money that gives her and her family
      everything they want, and which wearies me body and soul, to expect her to
      let me stay at home, and be quiet. I know I ought to dress and go into
      Gnu's house, and smirk at his wife, and stand up in a black suit before
      him attired in the same way, and talk about the same stocks that we
      discussed down town in the morning in colored trowsers. That's a social
      duty, I suppose. And I ought to see various slight young gentlemen whirl
      my wife around the room, and hear them tell her when they stop, that it's
      very warm. That's another social duty, I suppose. And I must smile when
      the same young gentlemen put their elbows into my stomach, and hop on my
      feet in order to extend the circle of the dance. I'm sure Mrs. P. is
      right. She does very right to ask, "Have we no social duties, I should
      like to know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And when we have performed these social duties in Gnu's house, how mean it
      is, how "it looks," not to build a larger house for him and Mrs. Gnu to
      come and perform their social duties in. I give it up. There's no doubt of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Polly said to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Potiphar, we're getting down town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, everybody is building above us, and there are actually shops in the
      next street. Singe, the pastry-cook, has hired Mrs. Croesus's old house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it. Old Croesus told me so some time ago; and he said how sorry he
      was to go. 'Why, Potiphar,' said he, 'I really hoped when I built there,
      that I should stay, and not go out of the house, finally, until I went
      into no other. I have lived there long enough to love the place, and have
      some associations with it; and my family have grown up in it, and love the
      old house too. It was our <i>home</i>. When any of us said 'home' we meant
      not the family only, but the house in which the family lived, where the
      children were all born, and where two have died, and my old mother, too.
      I'm in a new house now, and have lost my reckoning entirely. I don't know
      the house; I've no associations with it. The house is new, the furniture
      is new, and my feelings are new. It's a farce for me to begin again, in
      this way. But my wife says it's all right, that everybody does it, and
      wants to know how it can be helped; and, as I don't want to argue the
      matter, I look amen.' That's the way Mr. Croesus submits to his new house,
      Mrs. Potiphar."
    </p>
    <p>
      She doesn't understand it. Poor child! how should she? She, and Mrs.
      Croesus, and Mrs. Gnu, and even Mrs. Settum Downe, are all as nomadic as
      Bedouin Arabs. The Rev. Cream Cheese says, that he sees in this constant
      migration from one house to another, a striking resemblance to the "tents
      of a night," spoken of in Scripture. He imparts this religious consolation
      to me when I grumble. He says, that it prevents a too-closely clinging
      affection to temporary abodes. One day, at dinner, that audacious wag,
      Boosey, asked him if the "many manthuns" mentioned in the Bible, were not
      as true of mortal as of immortal life. Mrs. Potiphar grew purple, and Mr.
      Cheese looked at Boosey in the most serious manner over the top of his
      champagne-glass. I am glad to say that Polly has properly rebuked Gauche
      Boosey for his irreligion, by not asking him to her Saturday evening <i>matinees
      dansantes</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no escape from the house, however. It must be built. It was not
      only Mrs. Potiphar that persisted, but the spirit of the age and of the
      country. One can't live among shops. When Pearl street comes to Park
      Place, Park Place must run for its life up to Thirtieth street. I know it
      can't be helped, but I protested, and I will protest. If I've got to go,
      I'll have my grumble. My wife says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm ashamed of you, Potiphar. Do you pretend to be an American, and not
      give way willingly to the march of improvement? You had better talk with
      Mr. Cream Cheese upon the 'genius of the country.' You are really
      unpatriotic, you show nothing of the enterprising spirit of your time."
      "Yes," I answer. "That's pretty from you; you are patriotic aren't you,
      with your liveries and illimitable expenses, and your low bows to money,
      and your immense intimacy with all lords and ladies that honor the city by
      visiting it. You are prodigiously patriotic with your inane imitations of
      a splendor impossible to you in the nature of things. You are the ideal
      American woman, aren't you, Mrs. Potiphar?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I run, for I'm afraid of myself, as much as of her. I am sick of this
      universal plea of patriotism. It is used to excuse all the follies that
      outrage it. I am not patriotic if I do not do this and that, which, if
      done, is a ludicrous caricature of something foreign. I am not up to the
      time if I persist in having my own comfort in my own way. I try to resist
      the irresistible march of improvement, if I decline to build a great
      house, which, when it is built, is a puny copy of a bad model. I am very
      unpatriotic if I am not trying to outspend foreign noblemen, and if I
      don't affect, without education, or taste, or habit, what is only
      beautiful, when it is the result of the three.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, this is merely my grumble. I knew, the first morning Mrs.
      Potiphar spoke of a new house, that I must build it. What she said was
      perfectly true; we were getting down town, there was no doubt of the
      growing inconvenience of our situation. It was becoming a dusty noisy
      region. The congregation of the Rev. Far Niente had sold their church and
      moved up town. Now doesn't it really seem as if we were a cross between
      the Arabs who dwell in tents and those who live in cities, for we are
      migratory in the city? A directory is a more imperative annual necessity
      here than in any other civilized region. My wife says it is a constant
      pleasure to her to go round and see the new houses and the new furniture
      of her new friends, every year. I saw that I must submit. But I determined
      to make little occasional stands against it. So one day I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Polly, do you know that the wives of all the noblemen who will be your
      very dear and intimate friends and models when you go abroad, always live
      in the same houses in London, and Paris, and Rome, and Vienna? Do you know
      that Northumberland House is so called because it is the hereditary town
      mansion of the Duke, and that the son and daughter-in-law of Lord
      Londonderry will live after him in the house where his father and mother
      lived before him? Did that ever occur to you, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Potiphar," she replied, "do you mean to go by the example of foreign
      noblemen? I thought you always laughed at me for what you call 'aping.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I do, and so I will continue to do, Mrs. Potiphar; only I thought
      that, perhaps, you would like to know the fact, because it might make you
      more lenient to me when I regretted leaving our old house here. It has an
      aristocratic precedent."
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor, dear little Mrs. P.! It didn't take as I meant it should, and I said
      no more. Yet it does seem to me a pity that we lose all the interest and
      advantage of a homestead. The house and its furniture become endeared by
      long residence, and by their mute share in all the chances of our life.
      The chair in which some dear old friend so often sat&mdash;father and
      mother, perhaps&mdash;and in which they shall sit no more; the
      old-fashioned table with the cuts and scratches that generations of
      children have made upon it; the old book-cases; the heavy side-board; the
      glass, from which such bumpers sparkled for those who are hopelessly
      scattered now, or for ever gone; the doors they opened; the walls that
      echoed their long-hushed laughter,&mdash;are we wise when we part with
      them all, or, when compelled to do so, to leave them eagerly?
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember my brother James used to say: "What is our envy for our country
      friends, but that their homes are permanent and characteristic? Their
      children's children may play in the same garden. Each annual festival may
      summon them to the old hearth. In the meeting-house they sit in the wooden
      pews where long ago they sat and dreamed of Jerusalem, and now as they sit
      there, that long ago is fairer than the holy city. Through the open window
      they see the grass waving softly in the summer air, over old graves dearer
      to them than many new houses. By a thousand tangible and visible
      associations they are still, with a peculiar sense of actuality, near to
      all they love."
    </p>
    <p>
      Polly would call it a sentimental whim&mdash;if she could take Mrs.
      Croesus's advice before she spoke of it&mdash;but what then? When I was
      fifteen, I fell desperately in love with Lucy Lamb. "Pooh, pooh," said my
      father, "you are romantic, it's til a whim of yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he succeeded in breaking it up. I went to China, and Lucy married old
      Firkin, and lived in a splendid house, and now lies in a splendid tomb of
      Carrara marble, exquisitely sculptured.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was forty, I came home from China, and the old gentleman said, "I
      want you to marry Arabella Bobbs, the heiress. It will be a good match."
    </p>
    <p>
      I said to him,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh, pooh, my dear father, you are mercenary; it's all a whim of yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear son, I know it," said he, "the whole thing a whim. You can live
      on a hundred dollars a year, if you choose. But you have the whim of a
      good dinner, of a statue, of a book. Why not? Only be careful in following
      your whims, that they really come to something. Have as many whims as you
      please, but don't follow them all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not," said I; and fell in love with the present Mrs. Potiphar,
      and married her off-hand. So, if she calls this genuine influence of
      association a mere whim&mdash;let it go at that. She is a whim, too. My
      mistake simply was in not following out the romantic whim, and marrying
      Lucy Lamb. At least it seems to me so, this morning. In fact sitting in my
      very new "palatial residence," the whole business of life seems to me
      rather whimsical.
    </p>
    <p>
      For here I am, come into port at last. No longer young,&mdash;but worth a
      good fortune,&mdash;master of a great house,&mdash;respected down town,&mdash;husband
      of Mrs. Potiphar,&mdash;and father of Master Frederic ditto. Per contra; I
      shall never be in love again,&mdash;in getting my fortune I have lost my
      real life,&mdash;my house is dreary,&mdash;Mrs. Potiphar is not Lucy Lamb,&mdash;and
      Master Frederic&mdash;is a good boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game is all up for me, and yet I trust I have good feeling enough left
      to sympathize with those who are still playing. I see girls as lovely and
      dear as any of which poets have sung&mdash;as fresh as dew-drops, and
      beautiful as morning. I watch their glances, and understand them better
      than they know.&mdash;for they do not dream that "old Potiphar" does any
      thing more than pay Mrs. P.'s bills. I see the youths nervous about
      neckcloths, and anxious that their hair shall be parted straight behind. I
      see them all wear the same tie, the same trowsers, the same boots. I hear
      them all say the same thing, and dance with the same partners in the same
      way. I see them go to Europe and return&mdash;I hear them talk slang to
      show that they have exhausted human life in foreign parts and observe them
      demean themselves according to their idea of the English nobleman. I watch
      them go in strongly for being "manly," and "smashing the spoonies"&mdash;asserting
      intimacies with certain uncertain women in Paris, and proving it by their
      treatment of ladies at home. I see them fuddle themselves on fine wines
      and talk like cooks, play heavily and lose, and win, and pay, and drink,
      and maintain a conservative position in politics, denouncing "Uncle Tom's
      Cabin," as a false and fanatical tract; and declaring that our peculiar
      institutions are our own affair, and that John Bull had better keep his
      eyes at home to look into his coal mines. I see this vigorous fermentation
      subside, and much clear character deposited&mdash;and, also, much life and
      talent muddled forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is whimsical, because this absurd spectacle is presented by manikins
      who are made of the same clay as Plutarch's heroes-because, deliberately,
      they prefer cabbages to roses. I am not at all angry with them. On the
      contrary, when they dance well I look on with pleasure. Man ought to
      dance, but he ought to do something else, too. All genial gentlemen in all
      ages have danced. Who quarrels with dancing? Ask Mrs. Potiphar if I ever
      objected to it. But then, people must dance at their own risk. If Lucy
      Lamb, by dancing with young Boosey when he is tipsy, shows that she has no
      self-respect, how can I, coolly talking with Mrs. Lamb in the corner, and
      gravely looking on, respect the young lady? Lucy tells me that if she
      dances with James she must with John. I cannot deny it, for I am not
      sufficiently familiar with the regulations of the mystery. Only this; if
      dancing with sober James makes it necessary to dance with tipsy John&mdash;it
      seems to me, upon a hasty glance at the subject, that a self-respecting
      Lucy would refrain from the dance with James. Why it should be so, I
      cannot understand. Why Lucy must dance with every man who asks her,
      whether he is in his senses, or knows how to dance, or is agreeable to her
      or not, is a profound mystery to Paul Potiphar. Here is a case of woman's
      wrongs, decidedly. We men cull the choicest partners, make the severest
      selections, and the innocent Lucys gracefully submit. Lucy loves James,
      and a waltz with him (as P. P. knows very well from experience) is "a
      little heaven below" to both. Now, dearest Lucy, why must you pay the
      awful penance of immediately waltzing with John, against whom your womanly
      instinct rebels? And yet the laws of social life are so stern, that Lucy
      must make the terrible decision, whether it is better to waltz with James
      or worse to waltz with John! "Whether," to put it strongly with Father
      Jerome, "heaven is pleasanter than hell is painful."
    </p>
    <p>
      I say that I watch these graceful gamesters, without bitter feeling.
      Sometimes it is sad to see James woo Lucy, win her, marry her, and then
      both discover that they have made a mistake. I don't see how they could
      have helped it; and when the world, that loves them both so tenderly,
      holds up its pure hands of horror, why, Paul Potiphar, goes quietly home
      to Mrs. P., who is dressing for Lucy's ball, and says nothing. He prefers
      to retire into his private room, and his slippers, and read the last
      number of <i>Bleak House</i>, or a chapter in <i>Vanity Fair</i>. If Mrs.
      Potiphar catches him at the latter, she is sure to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      "There it is again; always reading those exaggerated sketches of society.
      Odious man that he is. I am sure he never knew a truly womanly woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Polly, when he comes back in September I'll introduce him to you," is the
      only answer I have time to make, for it is already half past ten, and Mrs.
      P. must be off to the ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know that our set is not the world, nor the country, nor the city. I
      know that the amiable youths who are in league to crush spooneyism are not
      many, and well I know, that in our set (I mean Mrs. P.'s) there are hearts
      as noble and characters as lofty as in any time and in any land. And yet,
      as the father of a family (viz. Frederic, our son), I am constrained to
      believe that our social tendency is to the wildest extravagance. Here, for
      instance, is my house. It cost me eighty-five thousand dollars. It is
      superbly furnished. Mrs. P. and I don't know much about such things. She
      was only stringent for buhl, and the last Parisian models, so we delivered
      our house into the hands of certain eminent upholsterers to be furnished,
      as we send Frederic to the tailor's to be clothed. To be sure, I asked
      what proof we had that the upholsterer was possessed of taste. But Mrs. P.
      silenced me, by saying that it was his business to have taste, and that a
      man who sold furniture, naturally knew what was handsome and proper for my
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The furnishing was certainly performed with great splendor and expense. My
      drawing-rooms strongly resemble the warehouse of an ideal cabinetmaker.
      Every whim of table&mdash;every caprice of chair and sofa, is satisfied in
      those rooms. There are curtains like rainbows, and carpets, as if the
      curtains had dripped all over the floor. There are heavy cabinets of
      carved walnut, such as belong in the heavy wainscotted rooms of old
      palaces, set against my last French pattern of wall paper. There are lofty
      chairs like the thrones of archbishops in Gothic cathedrals, standing by
      the side of the elaborately gilded frames of mirrors. Marble statues of
      Venus and the Apollo support my mantels, upon which <i>or molu</i> Louis
      Quatorze clocks ring the hours. In all possible places there are statues,
      statuettes, vases, plates, teacups, and liquor-cases. The woodwork, when
      white, is elaborated in Moresco carving&mdash;when oak and walnut, it is
      heavily moulded. The contrasts are pretty, but rather sudden. In truth, my
      house is a huge curiosity shop of valuable articles,&mdash;clustered
      without taste, or feeling, or reason. They are there, because my house was
      large and I was able to buy them; and because, as Mrs. P. says, one must
      have buhl and <i>or molu</i>, and new forms of furniture, and do as well
      as one's neighbors, and show that one is rich, if he is so. They are
      there, in fact, because I couldn't help it. I didn't want them, but then I
      don't know what I did want. Somehow I don't feel as if I had a home,
      merely because orders were given to the best upholsterers and fancy-men in
      town to send a sample of all their wares to my house. To pay a morning
      call at Mrs. Potiphar's is, in some ways, better than going shopping. You
      see more new and costly things in a shorter time. People say, "What a love
      of a chair!" "What a darling table!" "What a heavenly sofa!" and they all
      go and tease their husbands to get things precisely like them. When Kurz
      Pacha the Sennaar Minister, came to a dinner at my house, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless my soul! Mr. Potiphar, your house is just like your neighbor's."
    </p>
    <p>
      I know it. I am perfectly aware that there is no more difference between
      my house and Croesus's, than there is in two ten dollar bills of the same
      bank. He might live in my house and I in his, without any confusion. He
      has the same curtains, carpets, chairs, tables, Venuses, Apollos, busts,
      vases, etc. And he goes into his room, and thinks it's all a devilish
      bore, just as I do. We have each got to refurnish every few years, and
      therefore have no possible opportunity for attaching ourselves to the
      objects about us. Unfortunately Kurz Pacha particularly detested precisely
      what Mrs. P. most liked, because it is the fashion to like them. I mean
      the Louis Quatorze and the Louis Quinze things.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Taste, dear Mrs. Potiphar," said the Pacha, "was a thing not known in the
      days of those kings. Grace was entirely supplanted by grotesqueness, and
      now, instead of pure and beautiful Greek forms, we must collect these
      hideous things. If you are going backward to find models, why not go as
      far as the good ones? My dear madame, an <i>or molu</i> Louis Quatorze
      clock would have given Pericles a fit. Your drawing-rooms would have
      thrown Aspasia into hysterics. Things are not beautiful because they cost
      money; nor is any grouping handsome without harmony. Your house is like a
      woman dressed in Ninon de l'Enclos's bodice, with Queen Anne's hooped
      skirt, who limps in Chinese shoes, and wears an Elizabethan ruff round her
      neck, and a Druse's horn on her head. My dear madam, this is the kind of
      thing we go to see in museums. It is the old stock joke of the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      By Jove! how mad Mrs. Potiphar was! She rose from table, to the great
      dismay of Kurz Pacha, and I could only restrain her by reminding her that
      the Sennaar Minister had but an imperfect idea of our language, and that
      in Sennaar people probably said what they thought when they conversed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd better go to Sennaar, then, yourself, Mr. Potiphar," said my wife,
      as she smoothed her rumpled feathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Pon my word, madam, it's my own opinion," replied I. &mdash; Kurz Pacha,
      who is a philosopher (of the Sennaar school), asks me if people have no
      ideas of their own in building houses. I answer, none, that I know of,
      except that of getting the house built. The fact is, it is as much as Paul
      Potiphar can do, to make the money to erect his palatial residence, and
      then to keep it going. There are a great many fine statues in my house,
      but I know nothing about them: I don't see why we should have such heathen
      images in reputable houses. But Mrs. P. says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh! have you no love for the fine arts?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There it is. It doesn't do not to love the fine arts; so Polly is
      continually cluttering up the halls and staircases with marble, and
      sending me heavy bills for the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the house was ready, and my wife had purchased the furniture, she
      came and said to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, my dear P., there is one thing we haven't thought of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pictures, you know, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you want pictures for?" growled I, rather surlily, I am afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, to furnish the walls; what do you suppose we want pictures for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you, Polly," said I, "that pictures are the most extravagant kind
      of furniture. Pshaw! a man rubs and dabbles a little upon a canvas two
      feet square, and then coolly asks three hundred dollars for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me, Pot," she answered, "I don't want home-made pictures. What an
      idea! Do you think I'd have pictures on my walls that were painted in this
      country?&mdash;No, my dear husband, let us have some choice specimens of
      the old masters. A landscape by Rayfel, for instance; or one of Angel's
      fruit pieces, or a cattle scene by Verynees, or a Madonna of Giddo's, or a
      boar hunt of Hannibal Crackkey's."
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the use of fighting against this sort of thing? I told her to
      have it her own way. Mrs. P. consulted Singe the pastry cook, who told her
      his cousin had just come out from Italy with a lot of the very finest
      pictures in the world, which he had bribed one of the Pope's guard to
      steal from the Vatican, and which he would sell at a bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      They hang on my walls now. They represent nothing in particular; but in
      certain lights, if you look very closely, you can easily recognize
      something in them that looks like a lump of something brown. There is one
      very ugly woman with a convulsive child in her arms, to which Mrs. P.
      directly takes all her visitors, and asks them to admire the beautiful
      Shay douver of Giddo's. When I go out to dinner with people that talk
      pictures and books, and that kind of thing, I don't like to seem behind,
      so I say, in a critical way, that Giddo was a good painter. None of them
      contradict me, and one day when somebody asked, "Which of his pictures do
      you prefer?" I answered straight, "His Shay douver," and no more questions
      were asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      They hang all about the house now. The Giddo is in the dining room. I
      asked the Sennaar Minister if it wasn't odd to have a religious picture in
      the dining-room. He smiled, and said that it was perfectly proper if I
      liked it, and if the picture of such an ugly woman didn't take away my
      appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What difference does it make," said he, in the Sennaar manner, "it would
      be equally out of keeping with every other room in your house. My dear
      Potiphar, it is a perfectly unprincipled house, this of yours. If your
      mind were in the condition of your house, so ill-assorted, so confused, so
      overloaded with things that don't belong together, you would never make
      another cent. You have order, propriety, harmony, in your dealings with
      the Symmes's Hole Bore Co., and they are the secrets of your success. Why
      not have the same elements in your house? Why pitch every century,
      country, and fashion, higgledy-piggledly into your parlors and
      dining-room? Have everything you can get, in heaven's name, but have
      everything in its place. If you are a plodding tradesman, knowing and
      caring nothing about pictures, or books, or statuary, or <i>objets de
      vertu</i>; don't have them. Suppose your neighbor chooses to put them in
      his house. If he has them merely because he had the money to pay for them,
      he is the butt of every picture and book he owns."
    </p>
    <p>
      When I meet Mr. Croesus in Wall street, I respect him as I do a king in
      his palace, or a scholar in his study. He is master of the occasion. He
      commands like Nelson at the Nile. I, who am merely a diplomatist, skulk
      and hurry along, and if Mr. Croesus smiles, I inwardly thank him for his
      charity. Wall street is Croesus's sphere, and all his powers play there
      perfectly. But when I meet him in his house, surrounded by objects of art,
      by the triumphs of a skill which he does not understand, and for which he
      cares nothing,&mdash;of which, in fact, he seems afraid, because he knows
      any chance question about them would trip him up,&mdash;my feeling is very
      much changed. If I should ask him what <i>or molu</i> is, I don't believe
      he could answer, though his splendid <i>or molu</i> clock rang, indignant,
      from the mantel. But if I should say, 'Invest me this thousand dollars,'
      he would secure me eight per cent. It certainly isn't necessary to know
      what <i>or molu</i> is, nor to have any other <i>objet de vertu</i> but
      your wife. Then why should you barricade yourself behind all these things
      that you really cannot enjoy, because you don't understand? If you could
      not read Italian, you would be a fool to buy Dante, merely because you
      knew he was a great poet. And, in the same way, if you know nothing about
      matters of art, it is equally foolish for you to buy statues and pictures,
      although you hear on all sides that, as Mrs. P. says, one must love art.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As for learning from your own pictures, you know perfectly well, that
      until you have some taste in the matter, you will be paying money for your
      pictures blindly, so that the only persons upon whom your display of art
      would make any impression, will be the very ones to see that you know
      nothing about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In Sennaar, a man is literally 'the master of the house.' He isn't
      surrounded by what he does not understand; he is not obliged to talk book,
      and picture, when he knows nothing about these matters. He is not afraid
      of his parlor, and you feel instantly upon entering the house, the
      character of the master. Please, my dear Mr. Potiphar, survey your
      mansion, and tell me what kind of a man it indicates. If it does not
      proclaim (in your case) the President of the Patagonia Junction, a man
      shrewd, and hard, and solid, without taste or liberal cultivation, it is a
      painted deceiver. If it tries to insinuate by this chaotic profusion of
      rich and rare objects, that you are a cultivated, accomplished, tasteful,
      and generous man, it is a bad lie, because a transparent one. Why, my dear
      old Pot., the moment your servant opens the front door, a man of sense
      perceives the whole thing. You and Mrs. Potiphar are bullied by all the
      brilliancy you have conjured up. It is the old story of the fisherman and
      the genii. And your guests all see it. They are too well-bred to speak of
      it; but I come from Sennaar, where we do not lay so much stress upon that
      kind of good-breeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Paul Potiphar, it is one thing to have plenty of money, and quite
      another to know how to spend it."
    </p>
    <p>
      {Illustration}
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, as I told him, this kind of talk may do very well in Sennaar, but it
      is absurd in a country like ours. How are people to know that I'm rich,
      unless I show it? I'm sorry for it, but how shall I help it, having Mrs.
      P. at hand?
    </p>
    <p>
      "How about the library?" said she one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What library?" inquired I. &mdash; "Why, our library, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't any."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean to have such a house as this without a library?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," said I plaintively, "I don't read books&mdash;I never did, and I
      never shall; and I don't care anything about them. Why should I have a
      library?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, because it's part of a house like this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. P., are you fond of books?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not particularly. But one must have some regard to appearances.
      Suppose we are Hottentots, you don't want us to look so, do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought that it was quite as barbarous to imprison a lot of books that
      we should never open, and that would stand in gilt upon the shelves,
      silently laughing us to scorn, as not to have them if we didn't want them.
      I proposed a compromise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it the looks of the thing, Mrs. P.?" said I. &mdash; "That's all," she
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! well, I'll arrange it."
    </p>
    <p>
      So I had my shelves built, and my old friends Matthews and Rider furnished
      me with complete sets of handsome gilt covers to all the books that no
      gentleman's library should be without, which I arranged carefully, upon
      the shelves, and had the best looking library in town. I locked 'em in,
      and the key is always lost when anybody wants to take down a book.
      However, it was a good investment in leather, for it brings me in the
      reputation of a reading man and a patron of literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. P. is a religious woman&mdash;the Rev. Cream Cheese takes care of
      that&mdash;but only yesterday she proposed something to me that smells
      very strongly of candlesticks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pot., I want a <i>prie-dieu</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray-do what?" answered I. &mdash; "Stop, you wicked man. I say I want a
      kneeling-chair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A kneeling-chair?" I gasped, utterly confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A <i>prie-dieu</i>&mdash;a <i>prie-dieu</i>&mdash;to pray in, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      My Sennaar friend, who was at table, choked. When he recovered, and we
      were sipping the "Blue seal," he told me that he thought Mrs. Potiphar in
      a <i>prie-dieu</i> was rather a more amusing idea than Giddo's Madonna in
      the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She will insist upon its being carved handsomely in walnut. She will not
      pray upon pine. It is a romantic, not a religious, whim. She'll want a
      missal next; vellum or no prayers. This is piety of the 'Lady Alice'
      school. It belongs to a fine lady aid a fine house precisely as your
      library does, and it will be precisely as genuine. Mrs. Potiphar in a <i>prie-dieu</i>
      is like that blue morocco Comus in your library. It is charming to look
      at, but there's nothing in it. Let her have the <i>prie-dieu</i> by all
      means, and then begin to build a chapel. No gentleman's house should be
      without a chapel. You'll have to come to it, Potiphar. You'll have to hear
      Cream Cheese read morning prayers in a purple chasuble,&mdash;<i>que
      sais-je</i>? You'll see religion made a part of the newest fashion in
      houses, as you already see literature and art, and with just as much
      reality and reason."
    </p>
    <p>
      Privately, I am glad the Sennaar minister has gone out of town. It's bad
      enough to be uncomfortable in your own house without knowing why; but to
      have a philosopher of the Sennaar school show you why you are so, is
      cutting it rather too fat. I am gradually getting resigned to my house.
      I've got one more struggle to go through next week in Mrs. Potiphar's
      musical party. The morning soirees are over for the season, and Mrs. P.
      begins to talk of the watering places. I am getting gradually resigned;
      but only gradually.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! dear me, I wonder if this is the "home, sweet home" business the
      girls used to sing about! Music does certainly alter cases. I can't quite
      get used to it. Last week I was one morning in the basement
      breakfast-room, and I heard an extra cried. I ran out of the area door&mdash;dear
      me!&mdash;before I thought what I was bout, I emerged bareheaded from
      under the steps, and ran a little way after the boy. I know it wasn't
      proper. I am sorry, very sorry. I am afraid Mrs. Croesus saw me; I know
      Mrs. Gnu told it all about that morning: and Mrs. Settum Downe called
      directly upon Mrs. Potiphar, to know if it were really true that I had
      lost my wits, as everybody was saying. I don't know what Mrs. P. answered.
      I am sorry to have compromised her so. I went immediately and ordered a
      pray-do of the blackest walnut. My resignation is very gradual. Kurz Pacha
      says they put on gravestones in Sennaar three Latin words&mdash;do you
      know Latin? if you don't come and borrow some of my books. The words are:
      <i>ora pro me!</i>"

      IV. &mdash; FROM THE SUMMER DIARY OF MINERVA
    </h2>
    <p>
      TATTLE.
    </p>
    <p>
      NEWPORT, <i>August</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It certainly is not papa's fault that he doesn't understand French; but he
      ought not to pretend to. It does put one in such uncomfortable situations
      occasionally. In fact, I think it would be quite as well if we could
      sometimes "sink the paternal," as Timon Croesus says. I suppose everybody
      has heard of the awful speech pa made in the parlor at Saratoga. My
      dearest friend, Tabby Dormouse, told me she had heard of it everywhere,
      and that it was ten times as absurd each time it was repeated. By the by,
      Tabby is a dear creature, isn't she? It's so nice to have a spy in the
      enemy's camp, as it were, and to hear everything that everybody says about
      you. She is not handsome,&mdash;poor, dear Tabby! There's no denying it
      but she can't help it. I was obliged to tell young Downe so, quite
      decidedly, for I really think he had an idea she was good-looking. The
      idea of Tabby Dormouse being handsome! But she is a useful little thing in
      her way; one of my intimates.
    </p>
    <p>
      The true story is this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ma and I had persuaded pa to take us to Saratoga, for we heard the English
      party were to be there, and we were anxious they should see <i>some</i>
      good society at least. It seems such a pity they shouldn't know what
      handsome dresses we really do have in this country! And I mentioned to
      some of the most English of our young men, that there might be something
      to be done at Saratoga. But they shrugged their shoulders, especially
      Timon Croesus and Gauche Boosey, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, really, the fact is, Miss Tattle, all the Englishmen I have ever
      met are&mdash;in fact&mdash;a little snobbish. However."
    </p>
    <p>
      That was about what they said. But I thought, considering their fondness
      of the English model in dress and manner, that they might have been more
      willing to meet some genuine aristocracy. Yet, perhaps, that handsome Col.
      Abattew is right in saying with his grand military air,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "The British aristocracy, madam,&mdash;the British aristocracy is vulgar."
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, we all went up to Saratoga. But the distinguished strangers did not
      come. I held back that last muslin of mine, the yellow one, embroidered
      with the Alps, and a distant view of the isles of Greece worked on the
      flounces, until it was impossible to wait longer. I meant to wear it at
      dinner the first day they came, with the pearl necklace and the opal
      studs, and that heavy ruby necklace (it is a low-necked dress). The
      dining-room at the "United States" is so large that it shows off those
      dresses finely, and if the waiter doesn't let the soup or the gravy slip,
      and your neighbor, (who is, like as not, what Tabby Dormouse, with her
      incapacity to pronounce the <i>r</i>, calls "some 'aw, 'uff man from the
      country,") doesn't put the leg of his chair through the dress, and if you
      don't muss it sitting down&mdash;why, I should like to know a prettier
      place to wear a low-necked muslin, with jewels, than the dining-room of
      the "United States" at Saratoga.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kurz Pacha, the Sennaar minister, who was up there, and who is so smitten
      with Mrs. Potiphar, said that he had known few happier moments in this
      country than the dining hour at the "United States."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When the gong sounds," says he, "I am reminded of the martial music of
      Sennaar. When I seat myself in the midst of such splendor of toilette, and
      in an apartment so stately and so appropriate for that display, I recall
      the taste of the Crim Tartars, to whose ruler I had the honor of being
      first accredited ambassador. When I behold, with astonished eyes, the
      entrance of that sable society, the measured echo of whose footfalls so
      properly silences the conversation of all the nobles, I seem to see the
      regular army of my beloved Sennaar investing a conquered city. This, I cry
      to myself, with enthusiasm, this is the height of civilization; and I
      privately hand one of the privates in that grand army, a gold dollar, to
      bring me a dish of beans. Each green bean, O greener envoy extraordinary,
      I say to myself, with rapture, should be well worth its weight in gold,
      when served to such a congress of kings, queens, and hereditary prince
      royals as are assembled here. And I find," continues the Pacha, "that I am
      right. The guest at this banquet is admitted to the freedom of corn and
      potatoes, only after negotiations with the sable military. It is quite the
      perfection of organization. What hints I shall gather for the innocent
      pleasure-seekers of Sennaar who still fancy that when they bargain for a
      draught of rose sherbet, they have tacitly agreed for a glass to drink it
      from!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, the first day I came," he went on, "I was going to my room, and met
      the chambermaid coming out. Now, as I had paid a colored gentleman a
      dollar for my dinner, in addition to the little bill which I settle at the
      office, I thought it was equally necessary to secure my bed by a slight
      fee to the goddess of the chambers. I therefore pulled out my purse, and
      offered her a bill of a small amount. She turned the color of tomatoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Sir,' exclaimed she, and with dignity, 'do you mean to insult me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Good heavens, miss,' cried I, 'quite the contrary,' and thinking it was
      not enough, I presented another bill of a larger amount.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Sir,' said she, half sobbing, 'you are no gentleman; I shall leave the
      house!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was very much perplexed. I began again:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Miss&mdash;my dear&mdash;I mean madam&mdash;how much <i>must</i> I pay
      you to secure my room?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I don't understand you, sir,' replied the chambermaid, somewhat
      mollified.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Why, my dear girl, if I paid Sambo a dollar for my dinner, I expect to
      pay Dolly something for my chamber, of course.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well, sir, you are certainly very kind,&mdash;I&mdash;with pleasure, I'm
      sure,' replied she, entirely appeased, taking the money and vanishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I," said Kurz Pacha, "entered my room and locked the door. But I believe
      I was a little hasty about giving her the money. The perfection of
      civilization has not yet mounted the stairs. It is confined to the
      dining-room. How beautiful is that strain from the <i>Favorita</i>, Miss
      Minerva, tum, tum, ti ti, tum tum, tee tee," and the delightful Sennaar
      ambassador, seeing Mrs. Potiphar in the parlor, danced humming away.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are few pleasanter men in society. I should think with his
      experience he would be hard upon us, but he is not. The air of courts does
      not seem to have spoiled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear madam," he said one evening to Mrs. Potiphar, "if you laugh at
      anything, your laughing is laughed at next day. Life is short. If you
      can't see the jewel in the toad's head, still believe in it. Take it for
      granted. The <i>Parisienne</i> says that the English woman has no <i>je ne
      sais quoi</i>, The English woman says the <i>Parisienne</i> has no <i>aplomb</i>.
      Amen! When you are in Turkey&mdash;why gobble. Why should I decline to
      have a good time at the Queen's drawing-room, because English women have
      no <i>je ne sais quoi</i>, or at the grand opera, because French women
      lack <i>aplomb</i>? Take things smoothly. Life is a merry-go-round. Look
      at your own grandfather, dear Mrs. Potiphar,&mdash;fine old gentleman, I
      am told,&mdash;rather kept in what the artists call the middle-distance,
      at present,&mdash;a capital shoemaker, who did his work well&mdash;Alexander
      and John Howard did no more:&mdash;well here you are, you see, with
      liveries and a pew in the right church, and altogether a front seat in the
      universe&mdash;merry-go-round, you know; here we go up, up, up; here we go
      down, down, down, etc. By the bye, pretty strain that from Linda; tum tum,
      ti, tum tum," and away hopped the Sennaar minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Potiphar was angry. Who wouldn't have been? To have the old family
      shoes thrown in one's teeth! But our ambassador is an ambassador. One must
      have the best society, and she swallowed it as she has swallowed it a
      hundred times before. She quietly remarked&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pity Kurz Pacha drinks so abominably. He quite forgets what he's saying!"
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose he does, if Mrs. P. says so; but he seems to know well enough
      all the time: as he did that evening in the library at Mrs. Potiphar's,
      when he drew Cerulea Bass to the book-shelves, and began to dispute about
      a line in Milton, and then suddenly looking up at the books, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! there's Milton; now we'll see." But when he opened the case, which
      was foolishly left unlocked, he took down only a bit of wood, bound in
      blue morocco, which he turned slowly over, so that everybody saw it, and
      then quietly returned it to the shelf saying only&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg pardon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Pot, as Mrs. P. calls him, happened to be passing at the moment, and
      cried out in his brusque way&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I haven't laid in my books yet. Those are only samples&mdash;pattern-cards,
      you know. I don't believe you'll find there a single book that a
      gentleman's library shouldn't be without. I got old Vellum to do the thing
      up right, you know. I guess he knows about the books to buy. But I've just
      laid in some claret that you'll like, and I've got a sample of the
      Steinberg. Old Corque understands that kind of thing, if anybody does."
      And the two gentlemen went off to try the wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am astonished that a man of Kurz Pacha's tact should have opened the
      book-case. People have no right to suppose that the pretty bindings on
      one's shelves are books. Why, they might as well insist upon trying if the
      bloom on one's cheek, or the lace on one's dress, or, in fact, one's
      figure, were real. Such things are addressed to the eye. No gentleman uses
      his hands in good society. I've no doubt they were originally put into
      gloves to keep them out of mischief.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am as bad as dear Mrs. Potiphar about coming to the point of my story.
      But the truth is, that in such engrossing places as Saratoga and Newport,
      it is hardly possible to determine which is the pleasantest and most
      important thing among so many. I am so fond of that old, droll Kurz Pacha,
      that if I begin to talk about him I forget everything else. He says such
      nice things about people that nobody else would dare to say, and that
      everybody is so glad to hear. He is invaluable in society. And yet one is
      never safe. People say he isn't gentlemanly; but when I see the style of
      man that is called gentlemanly, I am very glad he is not. All the solemn,
      pompous men who stand about like owls, and never speak, nor laugh, nor
      move, as if they really had any life or feeling are called "gentlemanly."
      Whenever Tabby says of a new man&mdash;"But then he is so gentlemanly!" I
      understand at once. It is another case of the well-dressed wooden image.
      Good heavens! do you suppose Sir Philip Sidney, or the Chevalier Bayard or
      Charles Fox, were "gentlemanly" in this way? Confectioners who undertake
      parties might furnish scores of such gentlemen, with hands and feet of any
      required size, and warranted to do nothing "ungentlemanly." For my part, I
      am inclined to think that a gentleman is something positive, not merely
      negative. And if sometimes my friend the Pacha says a rousing and
      wholesome truth, it is none the less gentlemanly because it cuts a little.
      He says it's very amusing to observe how coolly we play this little farce
      of life,&mdash;how placidly people get entangled in a mesh at which they
      all rail, and how fiercely they frown upon anybody who steps out of the
      ring. "You tickle me and I'll tickle you; but at all events, you tickle
      me," is the motto of the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Allons!</i>" says he, "who cares? lead off to the right and left&mdash;down
      the middle and up again. Smile all round, and bow gracefully to your
      partner; then carry your heavy heart up chamber, and drown in your own
      tears. Cheerfully, cheerfully, my dear Miss Minerva.&mdash;Saratoga until
      August, then Newport till the frost, the city afterwards; and so an
      endless round of happiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he steps off humming <i>Il segreto per esser felice!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, we were all sitting in the great drawing-room at the "United
      States." We had been bowling in our morning dresses, and had rushed in to
      ascertain if the distinguished English party had arrived. They had not.
      They were in New York, and would not come. That was bad, but we thought of
      Newport and probable scions of nobility there, and were consoled. But
      while we were in the midst of the talk, and I was whispering very
      intimately with that superb and aristocratic Nancy Fungus, who should come
      in but father, walking towards us with a wearied air, dragging his feet
      along, but looking very well dressed for him. I smiled sweetly when I saw
      that he was quite presentable, and had had the good sense to leave that
      odious white hat in his room, and had buttoned his waistcoat. The party
      stopped talking as he approached; and he came up to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Minna, my dear," said he, "I hear everybody is going to Newport.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! yes, dear father," I replied, and Nancy Fungus smiled. Father looked
      pleased to see me so intimate with a girl he always calls "so aristocratic
      and high-bred looking," and he said to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe your mother is going, Miss Fungus?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! yes, we always go," replied she, "one must have a few weeks at
      Newport."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely, my dear," said poor papa, as if he rather dreaded it, but must
      consent to the hard necessity of fashion. "They say, Minna, that all the
      <i>parvenus</i> are going this year, so I suppose we shall have to go
      along."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a blow! There was perfect silence for a moment, while poor pa
      looked amiable as if he couldn't help embellishing his conversation with
      French graces. I waited in horror; for I knew that the girls were all
      tittering inside, and every moment it became more absurd. Then out it
      came. Nancy Fungus leaned her head on my shoulder, and fairly shook with
      laughter. The others hid behind their fans, and the men suddenly walked
      off to the windows and slipped on to the piazza. Papa looked bewildered,
      and half smiled. But it was a very melancholy business, and I told him
      that he had better go up and dress for dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to stay after that. The unhappy slip became the staple
      of Saratoga conversation. Young Boosey (Mrs. Potiphar's witty friend)
      asked Morris audibly at dinner, "Where do the <i>parvenus sit?</i> I want
      to sit among the <i>parvenus</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you do, sir," answered Morris, supposing he meant the circle of
      the <i>crême de la crême</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      {Illustration}
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the thing went on multiplying itself. Poor papa doesn't understand
      it yet, I don't dare to explain. Old Fungus who prides himself so upon his
      family (it is one of the very ancient and honorable Virginia families,
      that came out of the ark with Noah, as Kurz Pacha says of his ancestors
      when he hears that the founder of a family "came over with the
      Conqueror,") and who cannot deny himself a joke, came up to pa in the
      bar-room, while a large party of gentlemen were drinking cobblers, and
      said to him with a loud laugh:
    </p>
    <p>
      "So all the <i>parvenus</i> are going to Newport: are they, Tattle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes!" replied pa, innocently, "that's what they say. So I suppose we
      shall all have to go, Fungus."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another roar that time, but not from the representative of
      Noah's Ark. It was rather thin joking but it did very well for the warm
      weather, and I was glad to hear a laugh against anybody but poor pa.
    </p>
    <p>
      We came to Newport, but the story came before us, and I have been very
      much annoyed at it. I know it is foolish for me to think of it. Kurz Pacha
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Miss Minerva, I have no doubt it would pain you more to be
      thought ignorant of French than capable of deceit. Yet it is a very
      innocent ignorance of your father's. Nobody is bound to know French; but
      you all lay so much stress upon it, as if it were the whole duty of women
      to have an 'air' and to speak French, that any ignorance becomes at once
      ludicrous. It's all your own doing. You make a very natural thing absurd,
      and then grieve because some friend becomes a victim. There is your friend
      Nancy Fungus, who speaks 'French as well as she does English.' That may be
      true; but you ought to add, that one is of just as much use to her as the
      other&mdash;that is of no use at all, except to communicate platitudes.
      What is the use of a girl's learning French to be able to say to young <i>Téle
      de Choux</i>, that it is a very warm day, and that will hardly be <i>spirituelle</i>
      in her exotic French. It edge of French is going to supply her with ideas
      to express. A girl who is flat in her native English will hardly be <i>spirituelle</i>
      in her exotic French. It is a delightful language for the natives, and for
      all who have thoroughly mastered its spirit. Its genius is airy and
      sparkling. It is especially the language of society, because society is,
      theoretically, the playful encounter of sprightliness and wit. It is the
      worst language I know of for poetry, ethics, and the habit of the Saxon
      mind. It is wonderful in the hands of such masters as Balzac and George
      Sand, and is especially adapted to their purposes. Yet their books are
      forbidden to Nancy Fungus, Tabby Dormouse, Daisy Clover, and all their
      relations. They read <i>Telemaque</i>, and long to be married, that they
      may pry into <i>Leila and Indiana</i>: their French meanwhile, even if
      they wanted to know anything of French literature,&mdash;which is too
      absurd an idea,&mdash;serves them only to say nothing to uncertain hairy
      foreigners who haunt society, and to understand their nothings, in
      response. I am really touched for this Ariel, this tricksy sprite of
      speech when I know that it must do the bidding of those who can never fit
      its airy felicity to any worthy purpose. I have tried these accomplishel
      damsels who speak French and Italian as well as they do English. But our
      conversation was only a clumsy translation of English commonplace. And
      yet, Miss Minerva, I think even so sensible a woman as you, looks with
      honor and respect upon one of that class. Dear me! excuse me! What am I
      thinking of? I'm engaged to drive little Daisy Clover on the beach at six
      o'clock. She is one of those who garnish their conversation with French
      scraps. Really you must pardon me, if she is a friend of yours; but that
      dry gentlemanly fellow, D'Orsay Firkin, says that Miss Clover's
      conversation is a dish of <i>téte de veau farci</i>. Aren't you coming to
      the beach? Everybody goes to-day. Mrs. Gnu has arrived, and the Potiphars
      are here,&mdash;that is, Mrs. P. Old Pot. arrives on Sunday morning early,
      and is off again on Monday evening. He's grown very quiet and docile. Mrs.
      P. usually takes him a short drive on Monday morning, and he comes to
      dinner in a white waistcoat. In fact, as Mrs. Potiphar says, 'My husband
      has not the air <i>distingué</i> which I should be pleased to see in him,
      but he is quite as well as could be expected.' Upon which Firkin twirls
      his hat in a significant way; you and I smile intelligently, dear Miss
      Minerva; Mrs. Green and Mrs Settum Downe exchange glances; we all
      understand Mrs. Potiphar and each other, and Mrs. Potiphar understands us,
      and it is all very sweet and pleasant, and the utmost propriety is
      observed, and we don't laugh loud until we're out of hearing, and then say
      in the very softest whispers, that it was a remarkably true observation.
      This is the way to take life, my dear lady. Let us go gently. Here we go
      backwards and forwards. You tickle, and I'll tickle, and we'll all tickle,
      and here we go round&mdash;round&mdash;roundy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Sennaar minister danced out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is a droll man, and I don't quite understand him. Of course I don't
      entirely like him for it always seems as if he meant something a little
      different from what he says. Laura Larmes, who reads all the novels, and
      rolls her great eyes around the ball room,&mdash;who laughs at the idea of
      such a girl as Blanche Amory in Pendennis,&mdash;who would be pensive if
      she were not so plump,&mdash;who likes "nothing so much as walking on the
      cliff by moonlight,"&mdash;who wonders that girls should want to dance on
      warm summer nights when they have Nature, "and such nature" before them,&mdash;who,
      in fact, would be a mere emotion if she were not a bouncing girl,&mdash;Laura
      Larmes wonders that any man can be so happy as Kurz Pacha.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! Kurz Pacha," she says to him as they stroll upon the piazza, after he
      has been dancing (for the minister dances, and swears it is essential to
      diplomacy to dance well), "are you really so very happy? Is it possible
      you can be so gay? Do you find nothing mournful in life?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, my best Miss Laura," he replies, "to speak of; as somebody said
      of religion. You, who devote yourself to melancholy, the moon, and the
      source of tears, are not so very sad as you think. You cry a good deal, I
      don't doubt. But when grief goes below tears, and forces you in
      self-defence to try to forget it, not to sit and fondle it,&mdash;then you
      will understand more than you do now. I pity those of your sex upon whom
      has fallen the reaction of wealth,&mdash;for whom there is no career,&mdash;who
      must sit at home and pine in a splendid ennui,&mdash;who have learned and
      who know, spite of sermons and 'sound sensible view of things,' that to
      enjoy the high 'privilege of reading books,&mdash;of cultivating their
      minds; and, when they are married, minding their babies, and ministering
      to the drowsy, after-dinner ease of their husbands, is not the fulfilment
      of their powers and hopes. But, my amiable Miss Larmes, this is a class of
      girls and women who are not solicitous about wearing black when their
      great-aunt in Denmark dies, whom they never saw, nor when the only friend
      who made heaven possible to them, falls dead at their sides. Nor do they
      avoid Mrs. Potiphar's balls as a happiness which they are not happy enough
      to enjoy&mdash;nor do they suppose that all who attend that festivity&mdash;dancing
      to Mrs. P.'s hired music and drinking Mr. P.'s fines wines&mdash;are
      utterly given over to hilarity and superficial enjoyment. I do not even
      think they would be likely to run&mdash;with rounded eyes, deep voice, and
      in very exuberant health&mdash;to any one of us jaded votaries of fashion,
      and say, How can you be so happy? My considerate young friend, 'strong
      walls do not a prison make'&mdash;nor is a man necessarily happy because
      he hops. You are certainly not unhappy because you make eyes at the moon,
      and adjudge life to be vanity and vexation. Your mind is only obscured by
      a few morning vapors. They are evanescent as the dew, and when you
      remember them at evening they will seem to you but as pensive splendors of
      the dawn."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura has her revenge for all this snubbing, of course. She does not
      attempt to disguise her opinion that Kurz Pacha is a man of "foreign
      morals," as she well expresses it. "A very gay, agreeable man, who glides
      gently over the surface of things, but knows nothing of the real trials
      and sorrows of life," says the melancholy Laura Larmes, whose appetite
      continues good, and who fills a large armchair comfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is my opinion, however, that people of a certain size should cultivate
      the hilarious rather than the unhappy. Diogenes, with the proportions of
      Alderman Gobble, could not have succeeded as a Cynic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here at Newport there is endless opportunity of detecting these little
      absurdities of our fellow-creatures. In fact, one of the greatest charms
      of a watering-place, to me, is the facility one enjoys of understanding
      the whole game, which is somewhat concealed in the city. Watering-place
      life is a full dress parade of social weaknesses. We all enjoy a kind of
      false intimacy, an accidental friendship. Old Carbuncle and young Topaz
      meet on the common ground of a good cigar. Mrs. Peony and Daisy Clover are
      intimate at all hours. Why? Because, on the one hand, Mrs. P. knows that
      youth, and grace and beauty, are attractive to men, and that if Miss Rosa
      Peony, her daughter, has not those advantages, it is well to have in the
      neighborhood a magnet strong enough to draw the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, Daisy Clover is a girl of good sense enough to know&mdash;even
      if she didn't know it by instinct&mdash;that men in public places like the
      prestige of association with persons of acknowledged social position,
      which, by hook or by crook, Mrs. Peony undoubtedly enjoys. Therefore, to
      be of Mrs. P.'s party is to be well placed in the catalogue&mdash;the
      chances are fairer&mdash;the gain is surer. Upon seeing Daisy Clover with
      quiet little Mrs. Clover, or plain old aunt Honeysuckle,&mdash;people
      would inquire, Who are the Clovers? And no one would know. But to be with
      Mrs. Peony, morning, noon, and night, is to answer all questions of social
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, unhappily, in the city things are changed. There no attraction is
      necessary but the fine house, gay parties, and understood rank of Mrs.
      Peony to draw men to Miss Rosa's side. In Newport it does very well not to
      dance with her. But in the city it doesn't do not to be at Mrs. Peony's
      ball. Who knows it so well as that excellent lady? Therefore darling Daisy
      is dropped a little when we all return.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sweet girl," Mrs. P. says, "really a delightful companion for Rosa in the
      summer, and the father and mother are such nice, excellent people. Not
      exactly people that one knows, to be sure&mdash;but Miss Daisy is really
      amiable and quite accomplished."
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy goes to an occasional party at the Peonys. But at the opera and the
      theatre, and at the small intimate parties of Rosa and her friends, the
      darling Daisy of Newport is not visible. However, she has her little
      revenges. She knows the Peonys well: and can talk intelligently about
      them, which puts her quite on a level with them in the estimation of her
      own set. She rules in the lower sphere if not in the higher, and Daisy
      Clover is in the way of promotion. Yes, and if she be very rich, and papa
      and mamma are at all presentable, or if they can be dexterously hushed up,
      there is no knowing but Miss Daisy Clover will suddenly bloom upon the
      world as Mrs. P.'s daughter-in-law, wife of that "gentlemanly" young man,
      Mr. Puffer Peony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally it pains me very much to be obliged to think so of the people
      with whom I associate. But I suppose they are as good as any. As Kurz
      Pacha says: "If I fly from a Chinaman because he wears his hair long like
      a woman, I must equally fly the Frenchman because he shaves his like a
      lunatic. The story of Jack Spratt is the apologue of the world." It is
      astonishing how intimate he is with our language and literature.
      By-the-bye, that Polly Potiphar has been mean enough to send out to Paris
      for the very silk that I relied upon as this summer's <i>cheval de
      bataille</i>, and has just received it superbly made up. The worst of it
      is that it is just the thing for her. She wore it at the hall the other
      night, and expected to have crushed me, in mine. Not she! I have not
      summered it at Newport for&mdash;well, for several years, for nothing, and
      although I am rather beyond the strict white muslin age, I thought I could
      yet venture a bold stroke. So I arrayed <i>à la</i> Daisy Clover&mdash;not
      too much, <i>pas trop jeune</i>. And awaited the onset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kurz Pacha saw me across the room, and came up, with his peculiar smile.
      He did not look at my dress, but he said to me, rather wickedly, looking
      at my bouquet:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me! I hardly hoped to see spring flowers so late in the summer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he raised his eyes to mine, and I am conscious that I blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's very warm. You feel very warm, I am sure, my dear Miss Tattle," he
      continued, looking straight at my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are sufficiently cool, at least, I think," replied I. &mdash;
      "Naturally," said he, "for I've been in the immediate vicinity of the
      boreal pole for half an hour&mdash;a neighborhood in which, I am told,
      even the most ardent spirits sometimes freeze&mdash;so you must pardon me
      if I am more than usually dull, Miss Minerva."
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Pacha beat time to the waltz with his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at the part of the room from which he had just come, and there,
      sure enough, in the midst of a group, I saw the tall, and stately, and
      still Ada Aiguille.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is a hardy navigator," continued Kurz Pacha, "who sails for the boreal
      pole. It is glittering enough, but shipwreck by daylight upon a coral
      reef, is no pleasanter than by night upon Newport shoals."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you been shipwrecked, Kurz Pacha?" asked I suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed softly: "No, Miss Minerva, I am not one of the hardy
      navigators; I keep close in to the shore. Upon the slightest symptom of an
      agitated sea, I furl my sails, and creep into a safe harbor. Besides, dear
      Miss Minna I prefer tropical cruises to the Antarctic voyage."
    </p>
    <p>
      And the old wretch actually looked at my black hair. I might have said
      something&mdash;approving his taste, perhaps, who knows?&mdash;when I saw
      Mrs. Potiphar. She was splendidly dressed in the silk, and it's a pity she
      doesn't become a fine dress better. She made for me directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Minna, I'm so glad to see you. Why how young and fresh you look
      to-night. Really, quite blooming! And such a sweet pretty dress, too, and
      the darling baby-waist and all&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said that witty Gauche Boosey, "permit me, Miss Tattle,&mdash;quite
      an incarnate seraphim, upon my word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are too good," replied I, "my dear Polly, it is your dress which
      deserves admiration, and I flatter myself in saying so, for it is the very
      counterpart of one I had made some months ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, darling, and which you have not yet worn," replied she. "I said to
      Mr. P., 'Mr. P.' said I, 'there are few women upon whose amiability I can
      count as I can upon Minerva Tattle's, and, therefore, I am going to have a
      dress like hers. Most women would be vexed about it, and say ill-natured
      things if I did so. But if I have a friend, it is Minerva Tattle; and she
      will never grudge it to me for a moment.' It's pretty; isn't it? Just look
      here at this trimming."
    </p>
    <p>
      And she showed me the very handsomest part of it, and so much handsomer
      than mine, that I can never wear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Polly, I am so glad you know me so well," said I. "I'm delighted with the
      dress. To be sure, it's rather <i>prononce</i> for your style; but that's
      nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then a polka struck up. "Come along! give me this turn," said Boosey,
      and putting his arm round Mrs. Potiphar's waist, he whirled her off into
      the dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      How I did hope that somebody would come to ask me. Nobody came.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't dance?" asked Kurz Pacha, who stood by during my little talk
      with Polly P.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes," answered I, and hummed the polka.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kurz Pacha hummed too, looked on at the dancers a few minutes then turned
      to me, and looking at my bouquet, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is astonishing how little taste there is for spring-flowers."
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment young Croesus "came in" warm with the whirl of the dance,
      with Daisy Clover.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's very warm," said he, in a gentlemanly manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me! yes, very warm," said Daisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Been long in Newport?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; only a few days. We always come, after, Saratoga for a couple of
      weeks. But isn't it delightful?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so," said Timon, coolly, and smiling at the idea of anybody's being
      enthusiastic about anything. That elegant youth has pumped life dry; and
      now the pump only wheezes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" continued Daisy, "it's so pleasant to run away from the hot city,
      and breathe this cool air. And then Nature is so beautiful. Are you fond
      of Nature, Mr. Croesus?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tolerably,"' returned Timon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! but Mr. Croesus! to go to the glen and skip stones, and then walk on
      the cliff, and drive to Bateman's, and the fort, and to go to the beach by
      moonlight; and then the bowling-alley, and the archery, and the Germania.
      Oh! it's a splendid place. But perhaps, you don't like natural scenery,
      Mr. Croesus?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps not," said Mr. Croesus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, some people don't," said darling little Daisy, folding up her fan,
      as if quite ready for another turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, now; there it is," said Timon, and, grasping her with his right
      arm, they glided away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kurz Pacha," said I, "I wonder who sent Ada Aiguille that bouquet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir John Franklin, I presume," returned he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean by that," asked I. &mdash; Before he could answer,
      Boosey and Mrs. Potiphar stopped by us.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, Mr. Boosey," panted Mrs. P., "I will not have him introduced.
      They say his father actually sells dry goods by the yard in Buffalo."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, but <i>he</i> doesn't, Mrs. Potiphar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that, and it's all very well for you young men to know him, and to
      drink, and play billiards, and smoke, with him. And he is handsome to be
      sure, and gentlemanly, and I am told, very intelligent. But, you know, we
      can't be visiting our shoemakers and shopmen. That's the great difficulty
      of a watering-place, one doesn't know who's who. Why Mrs. Gnu was here
      three summers ago, and there sat next to her, at table, a middle-aged
      foreign gentleman, who had only a slight accent, and who was so affable
      and agreeable, so intelligent and modest, and so perfectly familiar with
      all kinds of little ways, you know, that she supposed he was the Russian
      Minister, who, she heard, was at Newport incognito for his health. She
      used to talk with him in the parlor, and allowed him to join her upon the
      piazza. Nobody could find out who he was. There were suspicions, of
      course. But he paid his bills, drove his horses, and was universally
      liked. Dear me! appearances are so deceitful! who do you think he was?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure I can't imagine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, the next spring she went to a music store in Philadelphia, to buy
      some guitar strings for Claribel, and who should advance to sell them but
      the Russian Minister! Mrs. Gnu said she colored&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I've always understood," said Gauche, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fie! Mr. Boosey," continued Mrs. P. smiling. "But the music-seller didn't
      betray the slightest consciousness. He sold her the strings, received the
      money, and said nothing, and looked nothing. Just think of it! She
      supposed him to be a gentleman, and he was really a music-dealer. You see
      that's the sort of thing one is exposed to here, and though your friend
      may be very nice, it isn't safe for me to know him. In a country where
      there's no aristocracy one can't be too exclusive. Mrs. Peony says she
      thinks that in future she shall really pass the summer in a farm-house or
      if she goes to a watering-place, confine herself to her own rooms and her
      carriage, and look at the people through the blinds. I'm afraid, myself,
      it's coming to that. Everybody goes to Saratoga now, and you see how
      Newport is crowded. For my part I agree with the Rev. Cream Cheese, that
      there are serious evils in a republican form of government. What a hideous
      head-dress that is of Mrs. Settum Downe's! What a lovely polka-redowa!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it is, by Jove! Come on," replied the gentlemanly Boosey, and they
      swept down the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Ah! ciel!</i>" exclaimed a voice close by us&mdash;Kurz Pacha and I
      turned at the same moment. We beheld a gentleman twirling his moustache
      and a lady fanning. They were smiling intelligently at each other, and
      upon his whispering something that I could not hear, she said, "<i>Fi!
      donc</i>" and folding her fan and laying her arm upon his shoulder, they
      slid along again in the dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is that?" inquired the Pacha.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you know Mrs. Vite?" said I, glad of my chance. "Why, my dear sir,
      she is our great social success. She shows what America can do under a
      French <i>regime</i>. She performs for society the inestimable service of
      giving some reality to the pictures of Balzac and George Sand, by the
      quality of her life and manners. She is just what you would expect a weak
      American girl to be who was poisoned by Paris,&mdash;who mistook what was
      most obvious for what was most characteristic,&mdash;whose ideas of
      foreign society and female habits were based upon an experience of
      resorts, more renowned for ease than elegance,&mdash;who has no instinct
      fine enough to tell her that a <i>lionne</i> cannot be a lady,&mdash;who
      imitates the worst manners of foreign society, without the ability or
      opportunity of perceiving the best,&mdash;who prefers a <i>double entendre</i>
      to a <i>bon-mot</i>,&mdash;who courts the applause of men whose
      acquaintance gentlemen are careless of acknowledging,&mdash;who likes fast
      driving and dancing, low jokes, and low dresses, who is, therefore, bold
      without wit, noisy without mirth, and notorious without a desirable
      reputation. That is Mrs. Vite."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kurz Pacha rolled up his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Jupiter! Miss Minerva," cried he, "is this you that I hear? Why you
      are warmer in your denunciation of this little wisp of a woman than you
      ever were of fat old Madame Gorgon, with her prodigious paste diamonds.
      Really, you take it too hard. And you, too, who used to skate so nimbly
      over the glib surface of society, and cut such coquettish figures of eight
      upon the characters of your friends. You must excuse me, but it seems to
      me odd that Miss Minerva Tattle, who used to treat serious things so
      lightly, should now be treating light things so seriously. You ought to
      frequent the comic opera more, and dine with Mrs. Potiphar once a week. If
      your good humor can't digest such a <i>hors d'oeuvre</i> as little Mrs.
      Vite, what will you do with such a <i>pièce de résistance</i> as Madame
      Gorgon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Odious plain speaker! Yet I like the man. But, before I could reply, up
      came another couple&mdash;Caroline Pettitoes and Norman de Famille.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were at the bowling-alley?" said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," answered Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You saw them together?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what do you think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, of course, that if he is not engaged to her he ought to be. He has
      taken her out in his wagon three times, he has sent her four bouquets, he
      waltzes with her every night, he bowls with her party every morning, and
      if that does not mean that he wants to marry her, I should like to know
      what it does mean," replied Caroline, tossing her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman de Famille smiled, and Caroline continued with rather a flushed
      face, because Norman had been doing very much the same thing with her:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is a girl to understand by such attentions?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, that the gentleman finds it an amusing game, and hopes she is
      equally pleased," returned De Famille.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Merci</i>, M. de Famille," said Caroline, with an energy I never
      suspected in her, "and at the end of the game she may go break her heart,
      I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hearts are not so brittle, Miss Pettitoes," replied Norman. "Besides, why
      should you girls always play for such high stakes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      They were just about beginning the waltz again, when the music stopped,
      and they walked away. But I saw the tears in Caroline's eyes. I don't know
      whether they were tears of vexation, or of disappointment. The men have
      the advantage of us because they can control their emotions so much
      better. I suppose Caroline blushed and cried, because she found herself
      blushing and crying, quite as much as because she fancied her partner
      didn't care for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned to Kurz Pacha, who stood by my side, smiling, and rubbing his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A charming evening we have had of it, Miss Minerva," said he, "an epitome
      of life&mdash;a kind of last-new-novel effect. The things that we have
      heard and seen here, multiplied and varied by a thousand or so, produce
      the net result of Newport. Given, a large house, music, piazzas, beaches,
      cliff, port, griddle-cakes, fast horses, sherry-cobblers, ten-pins, dust,
      artificial flowers, innocence, worn-out hearts, loveliness, black-legs,
      bank-bills, small men, large coat-sleeves, little boots, jewelry, and
      polka-redowas <i>ad libitum</i>, to produce August in Newport. For my
      part, Miss Minerva, I like it. But it is a dizzy and perilous game. I
      profess to seek and enjoy emotions, so I go to watering-places. Ada
      Aiguille says she doesn't like it. She declares that she thinks less of
      her fellow-creatures after she has been here a little while. She goes to
      the city afterward to refit her faith, probably. Daisy Clover thinks it's
      heavenly. Darling little Daisy! life is an endless German cotillion to
      her. She thinks the world is gay but well-meaning, is sure that it goes to
      church on Sundays and never tells lies. Cerulea Bass looks at it for a
      moment with her hard, round, ebony eyes, and calmly wonders that people
      will make such fools of themselves. And you, Miss Minerva, pardon me,&mdash;you
      come because you are in the habit of coming&mdash;because you are not
      happy out of such society, and have a tantalizing sadness in it. Your
      system craves only the piquant sources of scandal and sarcasm, which can
      never satisfy it. You wish that you liked tranquil pleasures and believed
      in men and women. But you get no nearer than a wish. You remember when you
      did believe, but you remember with a shudder and a sigh. You pass for a
      brilliant woman. You go out to dinners and balls; and men are, what is
      called, 'afraid of you.' You scorn most of us. You are not a favorite, but
      your pride is flattered by the very fear on the part of others which
      prevents your being loved. Time and yourself are your only enemies, and
      they are in league, for you betray yourself to him. You have found youth
      the most fascinating and fatal of flirts, but he, although your heart and
      hope clung to him despairingly, has jilted you and thrown you by. Let him
      go, if you can, and throw after him the white muslin and the baby-waist.
      Give up milk and the pastoral poets. Sail, at least, under your own
      colors; even pirates hoist a black flag. An old belle who endeavors to
      retain by sharp wit and spicy scandal the place she held only in virtue of
      youth and spirited beauty is, in a new circle of youth and beauty, like an
      enemy firing at you from the windows of your own house. The difficulty of
      your position, dear Miss Minerva, is, that you can never deceive those who
      alone are worth deceiving. Daisy Clover and Young America, of course,
      consider you a talented, tremendous kind of woman. Daisy Clover wonders
      all the men are not in love with you. Young America sniffs and shakes its
      little head, and says disapprovingly, 'Strong-minded woman!' But you fail,
      you know, notwithstanding. You couldn't bring old Potiphar to his knees
      when he first came home from China, and he must needs plunge in love with
      Miss Polly, whom you despised, but who has certainly profited by her
      intimacy with Mrs. Gnu, Mrs. Croesus, and Mrs. Settum Downe, as you saw by
      her conversation with you this evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Miss Minerva, I am only a benighted diplomat from Sennaar, but when I
      reflect upon all I see around me in your country; when I take my place
      with terror in a railroad car, because the certainty of frightful
      accidents fills all minds with the same vague apprehensions as if a war
      were raging in the land; when I see the universal rush and fury&mdash;young
      men who never smile, and who fall victims to paralysis; old men who are
      tired of life and dread death; young women pretty and incapable; old women
      listless and useless; and both young and old, if women of sense, perishing
      of ennui, and longing for some kind of a career;&mdash;why, I don't say
      that it is better anywhere else,&mdash;perhaps it isn't,&mdash;in most
      ways it certainly is not. I don't say certainly, that there's a higher
      tone of life in London or Paris than in New York, but only that, whatever
      it may be there, this, at least, is rather a miserable business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is your theory of life, then?" asked I. "What do you propose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kurz Pacha smiled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      {Illustration}
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose, Miss Minerva, I say the Golden Rule is my <i>theory</i> of life.
      You think it vague; but it is in that like most theories. Then I propose
      that we shall all be good. Don't you think it a feasible proposition? I
      see that you think you have effectually disposed of all complaint by
      challenging the complainer to suggest a remedy. But it is clear to me that
      a man in the water has a right to cry out, although he may not distinctly
      state how he proposes to avoid drowning. Your reasoning is that of those
      excellent Americans who declare that foreign nations ought not to strike
      for a republic until they are fit for a republic&mdash;as if empires and
      monarchies founded colleges to propagate democracy. Probably you think it
      wiser that men shouldn't go into the water until they can swim. Mr.
      Carlyle, I remember, was bitterly reproached for grumbling in his
      "Chartism," and other works, as if a man had no moral right to complain of
      hunger until he had grasped a piece of bread. 'What do you propose to do,
      Mr. Carlyle?' said they, 'what with the Irish, for instance?' Mr. C. said
      that he would compel every Irishman to work, or he would sink the island
      in the sea. 'Barbarous man, this is your boasted reform!' cried they in
      indignant chorus, unsuited either way, and permitting the Irish to go to
      the dogs in the meanwhile. So suffer me, dearest Miss Minerva, to regret a
      state of things which no sensible man can approve. Even if it seems to you
      light, allow me, at least, to treat it seriously, nor suppose I love
      anything less, because I would see it better. You are the natural fruit of
      this state of things, O Minerva Tattle! By thy fruits ye shall know them."
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few moments, he added in the old way:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't think I am going to break my heart about it, nor lose my appetite.
      Look at the absurdity of the whole thing. I am preaching to you in your
      baby-waist, here in a Newport ball-room at midnight. I humbly beg your
      pardon. There are more potent preachers here than I. Besides, I'm engaged
      to Mrs. Potiphar's supper at 12. Take things more gently, dear Miss
      Minerva. Don't make faces at Mrs. Vite, nor growl at your darling Polly.
      Women as smart as you are, will say precisely as smart thing of you as you
      say of them. We shall all laugh, first with you, and then at you. But
      don't deny yourself the pleasure of saying the smart things in hope that
      they will also refrain. That's vanity, not virtue. People are much better
      than you think, but they are also much worse. I might have been king of
      Sennaar, but I am only his ambassador. You might have been only a
      chambermaid, but you are the brilliant and accomplished Miss Tattle. Tum,
      tum, tum, ti, ti, ti,&mdash;what a pretty waltz! Here come Daisy and Timon
      Croesus, and now Mrs. Potiphar and Gauche Boosey, and now again Caroline
      Pettitoes and De Famille. She is smiling again, you see. She darts through
      the dance like a sunbeam as she is. Caroline is a philosopher. Just now,
      you remember, it was down, down, down,&mdash;now it is up, up, up. It is a
      good world, if you don't rub it the wrong way. Sit in the sun as much as
      possible. One preserves one's complexion, but gets so cold in the shade.
      Ah! there comes Mrs. Potiphar. Why, she is radiant! She shakes her fan at
      me. Adieu, Miss Minerva. Sweet dreams. To-morrow morning at the Bowling
      Alley at eleven, you know, and the drive at six. <i>Au revoir</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he was gone. The ball was breaking up. A few desperate dancers still
      floated upon the floor. The chairs were empty. The women were shawling,
      and the men stood attendant with bouquets. I went to a window and looked
      out. The moon was rising, a wan, waning moon. The broad fields lay dark
      beneath, and as the music ceased, I heard the sullen roar of the sea. If
      my heart ached with an indefinite longing,&mdash;if it felt that the airy
      epicurism of the Pacha was but a sad cynicism, masquerading in smiles,&mdash;if
      I dreaded to ask whether the wisest were not the saddest,&mdash;if the
      rising moon, and the plunging sea, and the silence of midnight, were
      mournful, if I envied Daisy Clover her sweet sleep and vigorous waking,&mdash;why,
      no one need ever know it, nor suspect that the brilliant Minerva Tattle is
      a failure.

    <h2>
      V. &mdash; THE POTIPHARS IN PARIS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A LETTER FROM MISS CAROLINE PETTITOES TO MRS. SETTUM DOWNE.
    </p>
    <p>
      PARIS, <i>October</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      MY DEAR MRS. DOWNE,&mdash;Here we are at last! I can hardly believe it.
      Our coming was so sudden that it seems like a delightful dream. You know
      at Mrs. Potiphar's supper last August in Newport, she was piqued by Gauche
      Boosey's saying, in his smiling, sarcastic way:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! do you really think this is a pretty supper? Dear me! Mrs.
      Potiphar, you ought to see one of our <i>petits soupers</i> in Paris, hey
      Croesus?" and then he and Mr. Timon Croesus lifted their brows knowingly,
      and smiled, and glanced compassionately around the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Paris, Paris!" cried Mrs. Potiphar; "you young men are always talking
      about Paris, as if it were heaven. Oh! Mr. P., do take me to Paris. Let's
      make up a party, and slip over. It's so easy now, you know. Come, come,
      Pot. I know you won't deny me. Just for two or three months, The truth
      is," said she, turning to D'Orsay Firkin, who wore that evening the
      loveliest shirt-bosom I ever saw, "I want to send home some patterns of
      new dresses to Minerva Tattle."
    </p>
    <p>
      They all laughed, and in the midst Kurz Pacha, who was sitting at the side
      of Mrs. Potiphar, inquired:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What colors suit the Indian summer best, Mrs. Potiphar?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, a kind of misty color," said Boosey, laughingly, and emphasizing <i>missed</i>,
      as if he meant some pun upon the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which conceals the outline of the landscape," interrupted Mrs. Gnu.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cajoling you with a sense of warmth on the very edge of winter, eh?"
      asked the Sennaar minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another loud laugh rang round the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought Minerva Tattle was a friend of yours, Kurz Pacha," said Mrs.
      Gnu, smiling mischievously, and playing with her beautiful bouquet, which
      Mrs. Potiphar told me Timon Croesus had sent her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, so she is," replied he. "Miss Minerva and I understand each
      other perfectly. I like her society immensely. The truth is, I am always
      better in autumn; the air is both cool and bright."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he said this he looked fixedly at Mrs. Gnu, and there was not quite so
      much laughing. I am sure I don't know what they meant by talking about
      autumn. I was busy talking with Mr. Firkin about Daisy Clover's pretty
      morning dress at the Bowling Alley, and admiring his shirt-bosom. Suddenly
      there was a knock at the door, and an exquisite bouquet was handed in for
      Kurz Pacha.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why didn't you wait until to-morrow?" said he, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man stammered some excuse, and the ambassador took the flowers. Mrs.
      Gnu looked at them closely, and praised them very much, and quietly
      glanced at her own, which were really splendid. Kurz Pacha showed them to
      all the ladies at table, and then handed them to Mrs. Potiphar, saying to
      her, as he half looked at Mrs. Gnu:
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is nothing autumnal here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Potiphar thanked him with real delight, and he turned toward Mrs.
      Gnu, at whom he had been constantly looking, and who was playing placidly
      with her bouquet, and said with an air of one paying a great compliment:
    </p>
    <p>
      "To offer <i>you</i> a bouquet, madame, would be to throw pearls before
      swine."
    </p>
    <p>
      We were all silent for a moment, and then the young men sprang up
      together, while we women laughed, half afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good heavens! Kurz Pacha, what do you mean?" cried Mrs. Potiphar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mean?" answered he, evidently confused, and blushing; "why, I'm afraid I
      have made some mistake. I meant to say something very polite, but my
      English sometimes gives way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your impudence never does," muttered Mrs. Gnu, who was unbecomingly red
      in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear madame," said the minister to her, "I assure you I meant only to
      use a proverb in a complimentary way; but somehow I have got the wrong pig
      by the ear."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another burst of laughter. The young men fairly lay down and
      screamed. Mr. Potiphar exploded in great ha ha's and ho ho's, from the end
      of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Potiphar," said Mrs. Gnu, with dignity, "I didn't suppose I was to
      be insulted at your table."
    </p>
    <p>
      And she went toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Gnu, Mrs. Gnu," said Polly, smothering her laughter as well as she
      could, "don't go. Kurz Pacha will explain. I'm sure he means no insult."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here she burst out laughing again; while the poor Sennaar Ambassador stood
      erect, and utterly confounded by what was going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure&mdash;I didn't know&mdash;I didn't&mdash;I wouldn't&mdash;Mrs.
      Gnu knows;" said he, in the greatest embarrassment. "I beg your pardon
      sincerely, madame." And he looked so humble and repentant that I was
      really sorry for him; but I saw Mr. Firkin laughing afresh every time he
      looked at the Ambassador, as if he saw something sly behind his penitence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps," said Firkin at last, "Kurz Pacha means to say that to offer
      flowers to a lady who has already so beautiful a bouquet, would be to
      carry coals to Newcastle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is it," cried the Pacha; "to Newcastle,"&mdash;and he bowed to Mrs.
      Gnu.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, Mrs. Gnu, it's only a mistake," said Mrs. Potiphar.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Gnu looked rather angry still, although Gauche Boosey tried very
      hard to console her, saying as many <i>bon mots</i> as he could think of&mdash;and
      you know how witty he is. He said at last;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why is Mrs. Gnu like Rachel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rachel who?" asked I. &mdash; I'm sure it was an innocent question; but
      they all fell to laughing again, and Mr. Firkin positively cried with fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      "D'ye give it up?" asked Mr. Boosey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Mrs. Potiphar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, because she will not be comforted."
    </p>
    <p>
      There wasn't half so much laughing at this as at my question&mdash;although
      Mrs. Potiphar said it was capital, and I thought so too, when I found out
      who Rachel was.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Gnu continued to be like Rachel, and Mr. Boosey continued to try
      to amuse her. I think it was very hard she wouldn't be amused by such a
      funny man; and he said at last aloud to her, meaning all of us to hear:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Mrs. Gnu, upon my honor, it is no epicure to try to console you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She did laugh at this, however, and so did the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you ever been in Sennaar, Mr. Boosey?" said Kurz Pacha.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I thought we might have learned English at the same school."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Boosey looked puzzled; but Mr. Potiphar broke in:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Mrs. Gnu, I'm glad to see you smile at last. After all, the remark
      of the Ambassador's was only what they would call in France, 'a perfect
      bougie of a joke.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good evening, Mrs. Potiphar," cried the Sennaar Minister, rising
      suddenly, and running toward the door. We heard him next under the window
      going off in great shouts of laughter, and whistling in the intervals,
      "Hail Columbia!" What shocking habits he has for a minister! I don't know
      how it was that Mr. Potiphar was in such good humor; but he promised his
      wife that she should go to Paris, and that she might select her party. So
      she invited us all who were at the table. Mrs. Gnu declined: but I knew
      mamma would let me go with the Potiphars.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Pot.," said Mrs. P., "we shall be gone so short a time, and shall be
      so busy, and hurrying from one place to another, that we had better leave
      little Freddy behind. Poor, dear little fellow, it will be much better for
      him to stay."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. P. looked a little sober at this; but he said nothing except to ask:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall you all be ready to sail in a fortnight?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, in a week," we all answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, we must hurry home to prepare," said he. "I shall write for
      state-rooms for us in Monday's boat, Polly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; that's a dear Pot.," said she; and as we all rose she went up
      to him, and took his arm tenderly. It was an unusual sight: I never saw
      her do it before. Mrs. Gnu said to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, really, that's rather peculiar. I think people had better make love
      in private."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, by Jove," whispered Mr. Boosey to me; "and I am afraid he had drank
      freely, as I have once or twice before heard that he did; but the world is
      such a gossip!&mdash;no, she doesn't let <i>her</i> good works of that
      kind shine before men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Mr. Boosey," said I, "how can you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you believe, darling Mrs. Downe, that instead of answering, he sort
      of winked at me, and said, under his voice, 'Good night, Caroline.' I drew
      myself up, you may depend, and said coldly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good evening, Mr. Boosey."
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew himself up too, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I called you Caroline, you called me Mr. Boosey."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then looking straight and severely at me, he actually winked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then of course, I knew he was not responsible for his actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah me, what things we are! Just as I was leaving the room with Mrs. Gnu,
      who had matronized me, Mr. Boosey came up with such a soft, pleading look
      in his eyes that seemed to say, "please forgive me," and put out his hand
      so humbly, and appeared so sorry and so afraid that I would not speak to
      him, that I really pitied him: but when, in his low, rich voice, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nymph, in thy orisons be all my sins remembered!"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I couldn't hold out; wasn't it pretty? So I put out my hand, and he shook
      it tenderly, and said "tomorrow" in a way&mdash;well, dear Mrs. Downe, I
      will be frank with you&mdash;that made me happy all night.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this rate I shall never get to Paris. But the next day it was known
      everywhere we were going and everybody congratulated us. Our party met at
      the Bowling Alley, and we began to make all kinds of plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! <i>we'll</i> take care of all the arrangements," said Mr. Boosey,
      nodding toward Mr. Croesus and Mr. Firkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Boosey, were you presented to the Emperor?" inquired Kurz Pacha.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly I was," replied he; "I have a great respect for Louis Napoleon.
      Those Frenchmen didn't know what they wanted; but he knew well enough what
      he wanted: they didn't want him, perhaps, but he did want them, and now he
      has them. A true nephew of his uncle, Kurz Pacha; and you can see what a
      man the great Napoleon must have been, when the little Napoleon succeeds
      so well upon the strength of the name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you are really enthusiastic about the Emperors," said the
      Ambassador.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," replied Mr. Boosey, "I have always been a great Neapolitan."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kurz Pacha stared at him a moment, and then took a large pinch of snuff
      solemnly. I think it's very ill bred to stare as he does sometimes, when
      somebody has made a remark. I saw nothing particular in that speech of Mr.
      Boosey's; and yet D'Orsay Firkin smiled to himself as he told Mrs. Gnu it
      was her turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder, my dear Mrs. Potiphar," said the Sennaar Minister seating
      himself by her side, as the game went on, "that Europeans should have so
      poor an idea of America and Americans, when such crowds of the very best
      society are constantly crossing the ocean. Now, you and your friends are
      going to Paris, perhaps to other parts of Europe, and I should certainly
      suppose that, without flattery, (taking another pinch of snuff,) the
      foreigners whom you meet might get rid of some of their prejudices against
      the Americans. You will go, you know, as the representatives of a republic
      where social ranks are not organized to the exclusion of any; but where
      talent and character always secure social consideration. The simplicity of
      the republican idea and system will appear in your manners and modes of
      life. Leaving to the children of a society based upon antique and
      aristocratic principles, to squander their lives in an aimless luxury, you
      will carry about with you, as it were the fresh airs and virgin character
      of a new country and civilization. When you go to Paris, it will be like a
      sweet country breeze blowing into a perfumer's shop. The customers will
      scent something finer than the most exquisite essence, and will prefer the
      fresh fragrance of the flower to the most elaborate distillation. Roses
      smell sweeter than attar of roses. You and your party, estimable lady,
      will be the roses. You will not (am I right <i>this</i> time?) carry coals
      to Newcastle; for if any of your companions think that the sharp eye of
      Paris will not pierce their pretensions, or the satiric tongue of Paris
      fail to immortalize it, they mistake greatly. You cannot beat Paris with
      its own weapons; and Paris will immensely respect you if you use your own.
      Poor little Mrs. Vite thinks she passes for a <i>Parisienne</i> in Paris.
      Why, there is not a <i>chiffonier</i> in the street at midnight that
      couldn't see straight through the little woman, and nothing would better
      please the <i>Jardin Mabille</i> than to have her for a butt. My dear
      madame, the ape is a very ingenious animal, and his form much resembles
      the human. Moles, probably, and the inhabitants of the planet Jupiter, do
      not discern the difference; but I rather think we do. A ten-strike by
      Venus! well done, Mrs. Gnu," cried the Ambassador; "now, Mrs. Potiphar."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pacha didn't play; but he asked Mr. Firkin what was a good average for
      a man, in the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, a spare every time," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Firkin," asked Mrs. Gnu, "what is a good woman's average?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does any lady here know that?" inquired the Pacha, looking round.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Mr. Boosey; "we must send and inquire of Miss Tattle." "How
      pleasantly the game goes on, dear Mrs. Gnu," said the Pacha; "but Miss
      Minerva ought to be here, she always holds such a good hand at every
      game."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think," said Mrs. Gnu, "that if she once got a good hold of any hand,
      she wouldn't let it go immediately."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good!" shouted Mr. Boosey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hi! hi!" roared Mr. Potiphar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pacha took snuff placidly, and said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've fairly trumped my trick, and taken it, Mrs. Gnu."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should say the trick has taken her," whispered Mr. Firkin at my elbow
      to Kurz Pacha.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sennaar Ambassador opened his eyes wide, and offered Mr. Firkin his
      snuff-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monday came at length. It was well known that we were all going&mdash;the
      Potiphars and the rest of us. Everybody had spoken of the difficulty of
      getting state-rooms on the steamer to town, and hoped we had spoken in
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have written and secured my rooms," said Mr. Potiphar to everybody he
      met; "I am not to be left in the lurch, my dear sir, it isn't my way." And
      then he marched on, Gauche Boosey said, as if at least both sides of the
      street were his way. He's changed a great deal lately.
    </p>
    <p>
      The De Familles were going the same day. "Hope you've secured rooms, De
      Famille," said Mr. Potiphar blandly to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," answered he, shortly; "no, not yet; it isn't my way; I don't mean to
      give myself trouble about things; I don't bother; it isn't my way."
    </p>
    <p>
      And each went his own way up and down the street. But early on Monday
      afternoon Mr. De Famille and his family drove toward Fall Kiver, from
      which place the boat starts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monday evening the Potiphars and the rest of us went to the wharf at
      Newport, and presently the boat came up. We bundled on board, and as soon
      as he could get to the office Mr. Potiphar asked for the keys of his
      rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, sir," said the clerk, "Mr. De Famille has them. He came on board at
      Fall Eiver and asked for your keys, as if the rooms had been secured for
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does that mean?" demanded Mr. Potiphar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! ah! I remember now," said Mr. Boosey. "I saw the De Familles all
      getting into a carriage for a little drive, as Mr. De F., said, about two
      o'clock this afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Potiphar looked like a thunder-storm. "What the devil does it mean?"
      asked he of the clerk, while the passengers hustled him, and punched him,
      and the hook of an umbrella-stick caught in his cravat-knot, and untied
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Send up immediately, and say that Mr. Potiphar wants his state-rooms,"
      said he to the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes the messenger returned and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. De Famille's compliments to Mr. Potiphar. Mr. De Famille and his
      family have retired for the night, but upon arriving in the morning he
      will explain everything to Mr. Potiphar's satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jolly!" whispered Mr. Boosey, rubbing his hands, to Mr. Firkin, on whose
      arm I was leaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you fond of the Italian opera, Mr. Potiphar?" inquired Kurz Pacha,
      blandly, Mrs. P. sat down upon a settee and looked at nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O Patience! do verify the quotation and smile," said the Ambassador to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a mean swindle," said Mr. Potiphar. "I'll have satisfaction. I'll go
      break open the door," and he started.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, don't be in a passion," said Mrs. Potiphar, "and don't be a
      fool. Remember that the De Familles are not people to be insulted. It
      won't do to quarrel with the De Familles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Splendid!" ejaculated Kurz Pacha.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've no doubt he'll explain it all in the morning," continued Mrs.
      Potiphar, "there's some mistake; why not be cool about it? Besides, Mr. De
      Famille is an elderly gentleman and requires his rest. I do think you're
      positively unchristian, Mr. Potiphar. The idea of insulting the De
      Familles!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mrs. Potiphar patted her little feet upon the floor in front of the
      ladies' cabin, where we were all collected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are you going to sleep?" asked Mr. Potiphar mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure I don't know," answered she.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had an awful night. It was worse than any night at sea. Mrs. P. was
      propped up in one corner of a settee and I in the other, and when I was
      fixed comfortably there would come a great sea, and the boat would lurch,
      and I had to disarrange my position. It was horrid. But Mr. Potiphar was
      very good all night. He kept coming to see if Polly wanted anything, and
      if she were warm enough, and if she were well. Gauche Boosey, who was on
      the floor in the saloon, said he saw Mr. P. crawl up softly and try his
      state-room door. But it was locked, "and the snoring of old De Famille,
      who was enjoying his required rest," said he, "came in regular broadsides
      through the blinds."
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't know how Mr. De Famille explained. I only know Mrs. P. charged old
      Pot. to be satisfied with anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are some people, my darling Caroline," she said to me, "with whom
      it does not do to quarrel. It isn't christian to quarrel. I can't afford
      to be on bad terms with the De Familles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is odd, isn't it," said Kurz Pacha to Mrs. P., as we were sailing down
      the harbor on our way to Europe, and talking of the circumstance of the
      state-rooms, "it is so odd, that in Sennaar, where to be sure,
      civilization has scarcely a foothold&mdash;I mean such civilization as you
      enjoy&mdash;this proceeding would have been called dishonest! They do have
      the oddest use of terms in Sennaar! Why, I remember that I once bought a
      sheep, and as it was coming to my fold in charge of my shepherd, a man in
      a mask came out of a wood and walked away with the sheep, and appropriated
      the mutton-chops to his own family uses. And those singular people in
      Sennaar called it stealing. Shall I ever get through laughing at them when
      I return! There ought to be missionaries sent to Sennaar. Do you think the
      Rev. Cream Cheese would go? How gracefully he would say: 'Benighted
      brethren, in my country when a man buys a sheep or a state-room, and pays
      money for it, and another man appropriates it, depriving the rightful
      buyer of his chops and sheep, what does the buyer do? Does he swear? Does
      he rail? Does he complain? Does he even ask for the cold pickings? Not at
      all, brethren; he does none of these things. He sends Worcestershire sauce
      to the thief, or a pillow of poppies, and says to him, Friend, all of mine
      is thine, and all of thine is thine own. This, benighted people of
      Sennaar, is the practice of a Christian people. As one of our great poets
      says, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.' Think how delicately
      the Rev. Cream would pat his mouth with the fine cambric handkerchief,
      after rounding off such a homily! He might ask you and Mrs. Potiphar to
      accompany him as examples of this Christian pitch of self-sacrifice. On
      the whole, I wouldn't advise you to go. The rude races of Sennaar, might
      put that beautiful forgiveness of yours to extraordinary proofs. Holloa!
      there's a sea!"
    </p>
    <p>
      We were dismally sea-sick. And I cared for nothing but arriving. Oh! dear,
      I think I would even have given up Paris, at least I thought so. But, oh!
      how <i>could</i> I think so! Just fancy a place where not only your own
      maid speaks French, but where everybody, the porters, the coachmen, the
      chambermaids, can't speak anything else! Where the very beggars beg, and
      the commonest people swear, in French! Oh! it's inexpressibly delightful.
      Why, the dogs understand it, and the horses&mdash;"everybody," as Kurz
      Pacha said to me, the morning after our arrival (for he insisted upon
      coming, "it was such a freak," he said,) "everybody rolls in a luxury of
      French, and, according to the boarding-school standard, is happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody&mdash;but poor Mr. Potiphar!
    </p>
    <p>
      He has a terrible time of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we arrived we alighted at Meurice's,&mdash;all the fashionable people
      do; at least Gauche Boosey said Lord Brougham did, for he used to read it
      in Galignani and I suppose it is fashionable to do as Lord Brougham does.
      D'Orsay Firkin said that the Hotel Bristol was more <i>récherché</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does that mean cheaper?" inquired Mr. Potiphar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Firkin looked at him compassionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only want," said Mr. Potiphar, in a kind of gasping way, for it was in
      the cars on the way from Boulogne to Paris that we held this consultation&mdash;"I
      only want to go where there is somebody who can speak English."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear sir, there are Commissionaires at all the hotels who are perfect
      linguists," said Mr. Firkin in a gentlemanly manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! dear me!" said Mr. P. wiping his forehead with the red bandanna that
      he always carries, despite Mrs. P., "what is a commissionaire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An interpreter, a cicerone," said Mr. Firkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A guide, philosopher, and friend," said Kurz Pacha.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kurz Pacha, do you speak French?" inquired Mr. P. nervously, as we rolled
      along.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! yes," replied he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! dear me!" said Mr. Potiphar, looking disconsolately out of the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      We arrived soon after.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are now at the <i>Barrière</i>" said Mr. Firkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do we do there?" asked Mr. Potiphar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are inspected," said Mr. Firkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Potiphar drew himself up with a military air.
    </p>
    <p>
      We alighted and walked into the room where all the baggage was arranged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Est-ce qu'il y a quelque chose à déclarer?</i>" asked an officer,
      addressing Mr. Potiphar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good heavens! what did you say?" said Mr. P., looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer smiled, and Kurz Pacha said something, upon which he bowed and
      passed on. We stepped outside upon the pavement, and I confess that even I
      could not understand everything that was said by the crowd and the
      coachmen. But Kurz Pacha led the way to a carriage, and we drove off to
      Meurice's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's awful, isn't it?" said Mr. Potiphar, panting.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we reached the hotel, a gentleman (Mr. Potiphar said he was sure he
      was a gentleman, from a remark he made&mdash;in English) came bowing out.
      But before the door of the carriage was opened, Mr. P. thrust his head out
      of the window, and holding the door shut, cried out, "Do you speak English
      here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, sir," replied the clerk; and that was the remark that so
      pleased Mr. Potiphar.
    </p>
    <p>
      My room was next to the Potiphars, and I heard a great deal, you may be
      sure. I didn't mean to, but I couldn't help it. The next morning, when
      they were about coming down, I heard Polly say&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Mr. Potiphar, remember, if you want to speak of your room it is <i>numero
      quatre-vingt cinq</i>" and she pronounced it very slowly. "Now try, Mr.
      P."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! dear me. Kattery vang sank," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good," answered she; "<i>au troisième</i>; that means, on the third
      floor. Now try."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O tror&mdash;Otrorsy&mdash;O trorsy&mdash;Oh! dear me!" muttered he in a
      tone of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>ème</i>," said Mrs. P.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aim," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" said Mrs. P.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O trorsyaim," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's very well, indeed!" said Mrs. Potiphar, and they went out of the
      room. I joined them in the hall, and we ran on before Mr. P., but we soon
      heard some one speaking, and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Monsieur, veut il prendre un commissionaire?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kattery&mdash;vang&mdash;sank," replied Mr. Potiphar, with great
      emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Comment?</i>" said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O tror&mdash;O tror&mdash;Oh! Polly&mdash;seeaim&mdash;seeaim!" returned
      Mr. P.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You speak English," said the commissionaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why! good God! do <i>you?</i>" asked Mr. P., with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I speaks every languages, sare," replied the other, "and we will use the
      English, if you please. But Monsieur speaks <i>très bien</i> the French
      language."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you speaking English now?" asked Mr. Potiphar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissionaire answered him that he was,&mdash;and Mr. P. thrust his
      arm through that of the commissionaire and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear sir, if you are disengaged I should be very glad if you would
      accompany me in my walks through the town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Potiphar!" said Polly, "come!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Coming, my dear," answered he, as he approached with the commissionaire.
      It was in vain that Mrs. P. winked and frowned. Her husband would not take
      hints. So taking his other arm, and wishing the commissionaire good
      morning, she tried to draw him away. But he clung to his companion and
      said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Polly, this gentleman speaks English."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't keep his arm," whispered she; "he is only a servant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Servant, indeed!" said he; "you should have heard him speak French, and
      you see how gentlemanly he is."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some time before Polly was able to make her husband comprehend the
      case.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said he, at length; "Oh! I understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      All our first days were full of such little mistakes. Kurz Pacha come
      regularly to see us, and laughed more than I ever saw him laugh before.
      The young men were away a great deal, which was hardly kind. But they said
      they must call upon their old acquaintances; and Polly and I expected
      every day to be called upon by their lady friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's very odd that the friends of these young men don't call upon us,"
      said Mrs. Potiphar to Kurz Pacha; "it would be only civil."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ambassador laughed a good deal to himself and then answered,
    </p>
    <p>
      "But they are not visiting ladies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean," said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ask Mr. Firkin," replied he.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when we saw them next, Mrs P. said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Firkin, I remember you used to tell me of the pleasant circles in
      which you visited in Paris, and how much superior French society is to
      American."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Infinitely superior," replied Mr. Firkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much more <i>spirituel</i>," said Mr. Boosey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Mrs. Potiphar, "we are going to stay only a short time to be
      sure, but we should like very much to see a little good society."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Mr. Firkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! yes, certainly," said Mr. Boosey; and the corners of his eyelids
      twitched.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you might suggest that you have some friends staying in town,"
      said Mrs. P. "You know we're all intimate enough for that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;oh yes," said Mr. Firkin, slowly; "but the truth is, it's a
      little awkward. These ladies are kind enough to receive us; but to ask
      favors of them, is, you see, different."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! yes," interrupted Mr. Boosey; "to ask favors of them is a very
      different thing," and his eyes really glistened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These are ladies, you see, dear Mrs. Potiphar," said Kurz Pacha, "who
      don't grant favors."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But still," continued Mr. Firkin, "if you only wanted to see them, you
      know, and be able to say at home that you knew Madame la Marquise
      So-and-so, and Madame la Comtesse So-and-so, and describe their dresses,
      why, we can manage it well enough; for we are engaged to a little party at
      the opera this evening with the Countess de Papillon and Madame Casta
      Diva, two of the best known ladies in Paris. But they never visit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How superbly exclusive!" said Mrs. Potiphar; "I wonder how that would do
      at home! However, I should be glad to see the general air and the
      toilette, you know. If we were going to pass the whole winter I would know
      them of course. But things are different where you stay so short a time.
      Eh, Kurz Pacha?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very different, Madame. But you are quite right. Make hay while the sun
      shines; use your eyes if you can't use your tongue. Eyes are great
      auxiliaries, you can use the tongue afterward. You've no idea how well you
      can talk about French society if you only go to the opera with a friend
      who knows people, and to your banker's soirées. If you chose to read a
      little of Balzac, beside, your knowledge will be complete."
    </p>
    <p>
      So we agreed to go to the opera. We passed the days shopping, and driving
      in the <i>Bois de Boulogne</i>. Sometimes the young men went with us, and
      D'Orsay Firkin confided to me one of his adventures, which was very
      romantic. You know how handsome he is, and how excessively gentlemanly,
      and how the girls were all in love with him last winter at home. Now you
      needn't say that I was, for you know better. I liked him as a friend. But
      he told me that he had often seen a girl in one of the shops on the
      Boulevards watching him very closely. He never passed by, but she always
      saw him, and looked so earnestly at him, that at length he thought he
      would saunter carelessly into the shop, and ask for some trifle. The
      moment he entered she fixed her eyes full upon him, and he says they were
      large and lustrous, and a little mournful in expression. But he scarcely
      looked at her, and asked at the opposite counter for a pair of gloves. He
      tried them on, and in the mirror behind the counter he saw the girl still
      watching him. After lingering for some time, and looking at everything but
      the girl, he sauntered slowly out again while her eyes, he said, grew
      evidently more mournful as she saw him leave without looking at her.
      Daily, for a week afterwards, he walked by the door, and she was always
      watching and looking after him with the most eager interest. Mr. Firkin
      did not say he was sorry for the little French girl, but I know that he
      really felt so. These men, that every woman falls in love with, are
      generous, I have always found. And I am sure he would never have confided
      this little affair to me, except for the very intimate terms upon which we
      are; for I have heard him say (speaking of other men) that nothing was
      meaner than for a man to tell of his conquests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the affair went on, he says, for some days longer. He was, at the
      time, constantly in attendance upon the Countess de Papillon, but often
      from the window of her carriage he has remarked the young girl pensively
      watching him, as she stretched gloves, or tied cravats around the necks of
      customers. At length he determined to follow the matter up, as he called
      it, and so marched into the shop one day, and going straight toward the
      mournful eyes, he asked for a pair of gloves. Mr. Firkin says the French
      women are so perfectly trained to conceal their emotions, that she did not
      betray, by any trembling, or turning pale, or stammering, the profound
      interest she felt for him, but quietly looked in his eyes, and in what Mr.
      Firkin called "a strain of Siren sweetness," asked what number he wore. He
      replied with his French <i>esprit</i>, as Kurz Pacha calls it, that he
      thought the size of her hand was about right for him; upon which she
      smiled in the most bewitching manner, and bringing out a large box of
      gloves, selected a pair of an exquisite <i>nuance</i>, as the French say,
      you know, and asking him to put out his hand, she proceeded to fit the
      glove to it, herself. Mr. Firkin remarked, that as she did so, she would
      raise her eyes to his whenever she found it necessary to press his fingers
      harder than usual, and when he thought the glove was fairly on, she kept
      pulling it down, and smoothing it; and finally taking his hand between
      both of hers, she brought the glove together, buttoned it, and said,
      "Monsieur has such a delicate hand," and smiled sweetly. Mr. Firkin said
      he bought an astonishing number of gloves that morning, and suddenly
      remembered that he wanted cravats. Fortunately the new styles had just
      come in, Marie said (for he had discovered her name), and she opened a
      dazzling array of silks and satins, and asking him to remove his
      neckcloth, she wound her hand in a beautiful silk, and throwing her arms,
      for a little moment, quite around his neck, she tied it in front; her
      little hands sometimes hitting his chin. Then taking him by the hand she
      led him to a mirror, in which he might survey the effect, while she stood
      behind him looking into the mirror over his shoulder, her head really
      quite close to his, and, in her enthusiasm about the set of the cravat,
      having forgotten to take her hand out of his. He stood a great while
      before that mirror, trying to discover if it really was a becoming tie. He
      said he never found so much difficulty in deciding. But Marie decided
      everything for him, and laid aside piles of cravats, and gloves, and fancy
      buttons, and charms, until he was quite dizzy, and found that he hadn't
      money enough in his pocket to pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is nothing," said the trustful Marie, "Monsieur will call again."
      Touched by her confidence he has called several times since, and never
      escapes without paying fifty francs or so. Marie says the <i>Messieurs
      Americains</i> are princes. They never have smaller change than a
      Napoleon, and they are not only the most regal of customers but the most
      polite of gentlemen. Mr. Firkin says he has often seen Frenchmen watching
      him, as he stood in the shop, with the most quizzical expression, and once
      or twice he has thought he heard suppressed laughter from a group of the
      other girls and the French gentlemen. But it was a mistake, for when he
      turned, the Frenchmen had the politest expression, and the girls were very
      busy with the goods. Poor French gentlemen! how they must be annoyed to
      see foreigners carrying off not only all the gloves, but all the smiles,
      of the beautiful Maries. It is really pleasant to see Gauche Boosey and
      D'Orsay Firkin promenade on the Boulevards. They are more superbly dressed
      than anybody else. They have such coats, and trowsers, and waistcoats, and
      boots,&mdash;"always looking," says Kurz Pacha, "as if they came into a
      large fortune last evening, and were anxious to advertise the fact this
      morning." Even the boys in the streets turn to look at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Boosey always buys the pattern shirts, and woollen morning dresses,
      and fancy coats, that hang in the shop windows. "Then," he says, "I am
      sure of being at the height of the fashion." Mr. Firkin is more quiet. The
      true gentleman, he says, is known by the absence of everything <i>prononcé</i>.
      "He is a very true gentleman, then," even Kurz Pacha says, "for I have
      never found anything <i>prononcé</i> in Mr. D'Orsay Firkin." The Pacha
      tells a good story of them. "The week after their arrival Mr. B. appeared
      in a suit of great splendor. It was a very remarkable coat, and waistcoat,
      covered with gilt sprigs, and an embroidered shirt-bosom, altogether a
      fine coronation suit for the king of the Cannibal Islands. Mr. Firkin, as
      usual, was rigorously gentlemanly, in the quiet way. They walked together
      up the Boulevards, Mr. B. flashing in the sun, and Mr. F. sombre as a
      shadow. The whole world turned to remark the extreme gorgeousness of Mr.
      Boosey's attire, which was peculiar even in Paris. At first that ornament
      of society rather enjoyed it, but such universal attention became a little
      wearisome, and at length annoying. Finally Mr. Boosey could endure it no
      longer, and turning round he stopped Mr. Firkin and looking at him from
      top to toe, remarked, 'Really I see nothing so peculiar in your dress that
      the whole town should stop to stare at you' Mr. Boosey is a man of great
      discrimination," concluded the Ambassador.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went with us to the opera, where we were to see the Countess de
      Papillon and Madame Casta Diva. The house was full, and the young
      gentlemen had told us where to look for their box. Mrs. Potiphar had made
      Mr. P. as presentable as possible, and begged the Sennaar Minister to see
      that Mr. P. did not talk too loud, nor go to sleep, nor offend the
      proprieties in any way; especially to cut off all his attempts at speaking
      French. She had hired the most expensive box.
    </p>
    <p>
      "People respect money, my dear," said Mrs. Potiphar to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But not always its owners, my dear," whispered Kurz Pacha in my other
      ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we entered the box all the glasses in the house were levelled at us.
      Mrs. Potiphar gayly seated herself in the best seat, nodding and chatting
      with the Ambassador; her diamonds glittering, her brocade glistening, her
      fan waving, while I slipped into the seat opposite, and Mr. Potiphar stood
      behind me in a dazzling expanse of white waistcoat, and his glass in his
      eye, as Mrs. P. had taught him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very successful entree" whispered the Pacha to Mrs. P. "I shall give
      out to my friends that it is the heiress presumptive of the Comanchees."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, really; what is the Comanchees?" said Polly levelling her glass all
      round the house, and laughing, and talking, and rustling, as if she were
      very, very happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there was a fresh volley of glasses towards our box, and, to our
      perfect dismay, we turned and saw that Mr. Potiphar had advanced to the
      front, and having put down his eye-glass, had taken out his old, round,
      silver-barred spectacles, and was deliberately wiping them with that great
      sheet of a hideous red bandanna, "prepartory to an exhaustive survey of
      the house," whispered Kurz Pacha to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. P. wouldn't betray any emotion, but still smiling, she hissed to him,
      under her breath:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. P., get back this minute. Don't make a fool of yourself. <i>Mais,
      monsieur, c'est vraiment charmant.</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter sentence was addressed with smiles to the Ambassador, as she
      saw that the neighbor in the next box was listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's uncommonly warm," said Mr. Potiphar in a loud tone, as he wiped his
      forehead with the bandanna.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I observe that Mrs. Potiphar betrays the heat in her face," said the
      Pacha, "which however, is merely a becoming carnation, Madame," concluded
      he, sinking his voice, and rubbing his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment in the box opposite, I saw our friends, Mr. Boosey and Mr.
      Firkin. By their sides sat two such handsome women! They wore a great
      quantity of jewelry, and had the easiest, most smiling faces you ever saw.
      They entered making a great noise, and I could see that the modesty of our
      friends kept them in the rear. For they seemed almost afraid of being
      seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like that," said Kurz Pacha; "it shows that such stern republicans
      don't intend ever to appear delighted with the smiles of nobility."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The largest one is Madame la Marquise Casta Diva," said Mrs. Potiphar,
      scanning them carefully, "I know her by her patrician air. What a splendid
      thing blood is, to be sure!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave herself several minutes to study the toilette of the lady, while
      I looked at the younger lady, Countess de Papillon, who had all kinds of
      little fluttering ends of ribbons, and laces, and scallops, and ruffles,
      and was altogether so stylish!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see now where Mr. Firkin gets his elegant manners," said Mrs. Potiphar;
      "it is a great privilege for young Americans to be admitted familiarly
      into such society. I now understand better the tone of their conversation
      when they refer to the French Salons."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear Madame," answered the Pacha, "this is indeed making the best
      of one's opportunities. This is well worth coming to Europe for. It is, in
      fact, for this that Europe is chiefly valuable to an American, as the
      experience of an observer shows. Paris is, notoriously, the great centre
      of historical and romantic interest. To be sure, Italy, Rome, Switzerland,
      and Germany,&mdash;yes, and even England,&mdash;have some few objects of
      interest and attention. But the really great things of Europe, the
      superior interests, are all in Paris. Why, just reflect. Here is the <i>Café
      de Paris</i>, the <i>Trois Frères</i>, and the <i>Maison Dorée</i>. I
      don't think you can get such dinners elsewhere. Then, there is the Grand
      Opera, the Comic Opera, and now and then the Italian&mdash;I rather think
      that is good music. Are there any such theatres as the <i>Vaudeville,</i>
      the <i>Varietés,</i> and the <i>Montansier,</i> where there is the most
      dexterous balancing on the edge of decency that ever you saw; and when the
      balance is lost, as it always is, at least a dozen times every evening,
      the applause is tremendous, showing that the audience have such a subtile
      sense of propriety that they can detect the slightest deviation from the
      right line. Is there not the <i>Louvre</i>, where, if there is not the
      best picture of a single great artist, there are good specimens of all?
      Will you please to show me such a promenade as the Boulevards, such fetês
      as those of the <i>Champ Elysées</i>, such shops as those of the <i>Passages</i>,
      and the <i>Palais Royal</i>. Above all, will you indicate to such students
      of mankind as Mr. Boosey, Mr. Firkin, and I, a city more abounding in
      piquant little women, with eyes, and coiffures and toilettes, and <i>je ne
      sais quoi</i>, enough to make Diogenes a dandy, to obtain their favor? I
      think, dear Madame, you would be troubled to do it. And while these things
      are Paris, while we are sure of an illimitable allowance of all this in
      the gay capital, we do right to remain here. Let who will, sadden in
      mouldy old Rome, or luxuriate in the orange-groves of Sorento and the
      south, or wander among the ruins of the most marvellous of empires, and
      the monuments of art of the highest human genius, or float about the
      canals of Venice, or woo the Venus and the Apollo; and learn from the
      silent lips of those teachers a lore sweeter than the French novelists
      impart;&mdash;let who will, climb the tremendous Alps, and feel the
      sublimity of Switzerland as he rises from the summer of Italian lakes and
      vineyards to the winter of the glaciers, or makes the tour of all climates
      in a day by descending those mountains towards the south;&mdash;let those
      who care for it, explore in Germany the sources of modern history, and the
      remote beginnings of the American spirit;&mdash;ours be the Boulevards,
      the demoiselles, the operas, and the unequalled dinners. Decency requires
      that we should see Rome, and climb an Alps. We will devote a summer week
      to the one, and a winter month to the other. They will restore us renewed
      and refreshed for the manly, generous, noble, and useful life we lead in
      Paris."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Admirably said," returned Mrs. Potiphar, who had been studying the ladies
      opposite while the Pacha was speaking, "but a little bit prosy," she
      whispered to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would charm you to hear how intelligently Mrs. P. speaks about French
      society, since that evening at the opera. When we return, you will find
      how accomplished she is. We have been here only a few weeks, and we
      already know all the fashionable shops, and a little more French, and we
      go to the confectioners, and eat <i>savarins</i> every morning at 12, and
      we drive in the <i>Bois de Boulogne</i> in the afternoon, and we dine
      splendidly, and in the evening we go to the opera or a theatre. To be
      sure, we don't have much society beside our own party. But then the
      shop-girls point out the distinguished women to Mrs. Potiphar, so that she
      can point them out when we drive; and our banker calls and keeps us up in
      gossip; and Mrs. Potiphar's maid, Adèle, is inestimable in furnishing
      information; and Mr. Potiphar gets a great deal out of his commissionaire,
      and goes about studying his Galignani's Guide, and frequents the English
      Heading Room, where I am told, he makes himself a little conspicuous when
      he finds that Englishmen won't talk, by saying, "Oh! dear me!" and wiping
      his face with a bandanna. He usually opens his advances by making sure of
      an Englishman, and saying, "<i>Bon matin,</i>&mdash;but, perhaps, sir, you
      don't speak French."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You evidently do not, sir," replied one gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir; you're right there," answered Mr. P. But he couldn't get another
      word from his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this delightful round the weeks glide by.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must be enjoying yourself immensely," says the Pacha. "You understand
      life, my dear Mrs. Potiphar. Here you are, speaking very little French, in
      a city where the language is an atmosphere, and where you are in no sense
      acclimated until you can speak it fluently&mdash;with all French life shut
      out from you&mdash;living in a hotel&mdash;cheated by butcher, baker, and
      candlestick-maker&mdash;going to hear plays that you imperfectly
      understand&mdash;to an opera where you know nobody, and where your box is
      filled with your own countrymen, who are delightful, indeed, but whom you
      didn't come to Paris to see&mdash;constantly buying a hundred things
      because they are pretty, and because you are in Paris&mdash;entirely
      ignorant, and quite as careless, of the historical interests of the city,
      of the pictures, of the statues, and buildings&mdash;surrounded by
      celebrities of all kinds, of whom you never heard, and therefore lose the
      opportunity of seeing them&mdash;in fact, paying the most extravagant
      price for everything, and purchasing only the consciousness of being in
      Paris&mdash;why, you ought to be happy, and considered to be having a fine
      time of it, if you are not? How naturally you will sigh for all this when
      you return and recur to Paris as the culmination of human bliss! Here's my
      honored Potiphar, who has this morning been taken to a darkened room in a
      grand old house, in a lonely, aristocratic street; and there a
      picture-agent has shown him a splendid Nicolas Poussin, painted in his
      prime for the family, whose heir in reduced circumstances must now part
      with it at a tearful sacrifice. Honored P.'s friend, the commissionaire,
      interprets this story, while the agent stands sadly meditating the
      sacrifice with which his duty acquaints him. He informs the good P.,
      through the friendly commissionaire, that he has been induced to offer him
      the picture, not only because all Americans have so fine a taste (as his
      experience has proved to him) in paintings, nor because they are so much
      more truly munificent than the nobility of other nations, but because the
      heir in reduced circumstances wishes to think of the picture as entirely
      removed from the possibility of being seen in France. Family pride, which
      is almost crushed in disposing of so great and valued a work, would be
      entirely quenched, if the sale were to be known, and the picture
      recognized elsewhere in the country. Monsieur is a gentleman, and he will
      understand the feelings of a gentleman under such circumstances. The
      commissionaire and the picture-agent therefore preserve a profound
      silence, and my honored friend feels for his red bandanna, and is not
      comfortable in the lonely old house, with the picture and the people. The
      agent says that it is not unusual for the owner to visit the picture about
      that very hour, to hear what chance there is for its sale. If this knock
      should be he, it would not be very remarkable. The heir enters. He has a
      very heavy moustache, dark hair, and a slightly Hebrew cast of
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Potiphar is introduced. The heir contemplates the picture sadly, and
      he and the agent point out its beauties to each other. In fine, my honored
      Potiphar buys the work of art. To any one else, of course, in France, for
      instance, the price should be eleven thousand francs. But the French and
      the Americans have fraternized; a thousand francs shall be deducted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see clearly it's quite worth while coming to Paris to do this,
      because I suppose, there are not more than ten or twenty artists at home
      who could paint ten or twenty times as good a picture for a quarter of the
      price. But you, dearest Mrs. P., who know all about pictures, naturally
      don't want American pictures in your house, any more than you want
      anything else American there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My young friends and allies, Messrs. Boosey, Firkin, and Croesus, say
      that they come to Paris to see the world. They get the words wrong, you
      know. They come that the world (that is, <i>their</i> world at home) may
      not see them. To accompany Mesdames de Papillon and Casta Diva to the
      opera, then to return to beautifully furnished apartments to sup, and to
      prolong the entertainment until morning, is what those charming youths
      mean when they say 'see the world.' To attend at that <i>réunion</i> of
      the <i>Haut Ton</i>, Monsieur Celarius' dancing academy, is to see good
      society in Paris, after the manner of those dashing men of the world. It's
      amusing enough, and it's innocent enough in its way. They won't go very
      far. They'll spend a good deal of money for nothing. They'll be plucked at
      gaming-houses. They'll be quietly laughed at by Mesdames de Papillon and
      Casta Diva, and the male friends of those ladies who enjoy the benefit of
      the lavish bounty of our young Croesus and Firkins. They'll swagger a good
      deal, and take airs, and come home and indulge in foreign habits now grown
      indispensable. They will pronounce upon the female toilette, and upon the
      <i>gantier le plus comme il faut</i>, in Paris. They will beg your pardon
      for expressing a little phrase in French&mdash;to which, really the
      English is inadequate. They will have, necessarily, the foreign air. Some
      of them will settle away into business men, and be very exemplary. Others
      will return to Paris, as moths to the light, asserting that the only place
      for a gentleman to live agreeably, to indulge his tastes, and get the most
      for his money, is Paris&mdash;which is strictly true of such gentlemen as
      they. A view of life that starts from the dinner-table, inevitably selects
      Paris for its career. For, obviously, if you live to dine well you must
      live where there is good cooking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You women are rather worse off than the young men, Mrs. P.; because you
      are necessarily so much more confined to the house. Unless, indeed, you
      imitate Mrs. Vite, who goes wherever the gentlemen go, and who is famous
      as <i>L'Américaine</i>. If you like that sort of thing, you can do as much
      of it as you please. It will always surround you with a certain kind of
      man,&mdash;and withdraw from your society a certain kind of woman, and a
      certain kind of respect."
    </p>
    <p>
      {Illustration}
    </p>
    <p>
      "To conclude my sermon, ladies, Europe is a charmed name to Americans,
      because in Europe are the fountains of all our education and training.
      History is the story of that hemisphere; the ruins of empires, arts, and
      civilizations, are here. Now, if there is any use in living at all, which
      I am far from asserting, is it worth while to get nothing out of Europe
      but a prolonged supper with Madame Casta Diva, or a wardrobe of all the
      charming dresses in Paris, and a facility of scandal which has all the
      wickedness and none of the wit of the finest French-woman? I beg a
      thousand pardons for preaching, but the text was altogether too pregnant."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so Kurz Pacha whirled out of the room, humming a waltz of Strauss. He
      has heard of his recall to Sennaar since he has been here&mdash;and we
      shall hear nothing more of him. We, too, leave Paris in a few days for
      home, and you will not hear from us again. Mrs. Potiphar has been as busy
      as possible getting up the greatest variety of dresses. You will see that
      she has not been to Paris for nothing. Kurz Pacha asked us if we had been
      to the Louvre, where the great pictures are. But when I inquired if there
      were any of Mr. Düsseldorf's there, and he said no, why, of course, as he
      is my favorite, and I know more of his works than I do of any others, I
      didn't go. There are some very pretty things there, Mr. Boosey says. But
      ladies have no time for such matters. Do you know, the other evening we
      went to the ball at the Tuileries, and oh! it was splendid. There were one
      duke and three marquesses, and a great many counts, presented to me. They
      all said, "It's charming, this evening," and I said, "very charming,
      indeed." Wasn't it nice?
    </p>
    <p>
      But you should have seen Mrs. Potiphar when the Emperor Napoleon III.
      spoke to her. You know what a great man he is, and what a benefactor to
      his country, and how pure, and noble, and upright his private character
      and career have been; and how, as Kurz Pacha said, he is radiant with
      royalty, and honors everybody to whom he speaks. Well, Mrs. P. was
      presented, and sank almost to the ground in her reverence. But she
      actually trembled with delight when the Emperor said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame, I remember with the greatest pleasure the beautiful city of New
      York."
    </p>
    <p>
      I am sure the Emgress Eugenie would have been jealous, could she have
      heard the tone in which it was said. Wasn't it affable in such a great
      monarch towards a mere republican? I wonder how people can slander him so,
      and tell such stories about him. I never saw a nicer man; only he looks
      sleepy. I suppose the cares of state oppress him, poor man! But one thing
      you may be sure of, dear Mrs. Downe, if people at home laugh at the
      Emperor and condemn him, just find out <i>if they have ever been invited
      to the Tuileries</i>. If not, you will understand the reason of their
      hatred. Mrs. Potiphar says to the Americans here that she can't hear the
      Emperor spoken against, for they are on the best of terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course the French dislike him" says Mr. Firkin, who has a turn for
      politics, "for they want a republic before they are ready for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      How you would enjoy all this, dear, and how sorry I am you are not here. I
      think Mr. Potiphar is rather disconsolate. He whistles and looks out of
      the window down into the garden of the Tuileries, where the children play
      under the trees; and as he looks he stops whistling, and gazes sometimes
      for half an hour; and whenever he goes out afterward, he is sure to buy
      something for Freddy. When the shopkeeper asks where it shall be sent, Mr.
      P. says, in a loud, slow voice&mdash;"Hotel Mureece,
      Kattery-vang-sank-o-trorsyaim."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is astonishing, as Kurz Pacha said that we are not more respected
      abroad. "Foreigners will never know what you really are," said he to Mr.
      P., "until they come to you. Your going to them has failed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Good bye, dearest Mrs. Downe. We are so sorry to come home! You won't hear
      from us again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your ever affectionate
    </p>
    <p>
      CAROLINE

    <h2>
      VI. &mdash; KURZ PACHA TO THE KING OF SENNAAR,
    </h2>
    <p>
      UPON RECEIVING HIS LETTERS OF RECALL.
    </p>
    <p>
      (NOW FIRST TRANSLATED.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MOST SABLE AND SERENE MASTER:
    </p>
    <p>
      I hear and obey. You said to me, Go, and I went. You now say, come, and I
      am coming, with the readiness that befits a slave, and the cheerfulness
      that marks the philosopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accustomed from my youth to breathe the scented air of Sennaar saloons,
      and to lounge in listless idleness with young Sennaar, I am weary of the
      simple purity of manners that distinguishes this people, and long for the
      pleasing, if pointless frivolities of your court.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming, as you commanded, to observe and report the social state of the
      metropolis of a people who, in the presence of the world, have renounced
      the feudal organization of society, I have found them, as you anticipated,
      totally free from the petty ambitions, the bitter resolves, and the hollow
      pretences, that characterize the society of older states.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people of the first fashion unite the greatest simplicity of character
      with the utmost variety of intelligence, and the most graceful elegance of
      manner. Knowing that for an American the only nobility is that of feeling;
      the only grace, generosity; and the only elegance, simplicity; they have
      achieved a society which is a blithe Arcadia, illustrating to the world
      the principles they profess, and making the friend of man rejoice.
    </p>
    <p>
      We, who are reputed savages, might well be astonished and fascinated with
      the results of civilization, as they are here displayed. The universal
      courtesy and consideration&mdash;the gentle charity, which does not
      consider the appearance but the substance&mdash;the republican
      independence, which teaches foreign lords and ladies the worthlessness of
      mere rank, by obviously respecting the character and not the title&mdash;the
      eagerness with which foreign habits are subdued, by the positive nature of
      American manners&mdash;the readiness to assist&mdash;the total want of
      coarse social emulation&mdash;the absence of ignorance, prejudice and
      vulgarity, in the selecter circles&mdash;the broad, sweet, catholic
      welcome to all that is essentially national and characteristic, which
      sends the young American abroad only that he may return eschewing European
      habits, and with a confidence in man and his country, chastened by
      experience&mdash;these have most interested and charmed me in the
      observation of this pleasing people.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is here the pride of every man to bear his part in the universal labor.
      The young men, instead of sighing for other institutions, and the
      immunities of rank, prefer to deserve, by earning, their own patents of
      Nobility. They are industrious, temperate, and frugal, as becomes the
      youth to whom the destinies of so great a nation, and the hopes of the
      world, are committed. They are proud to have raised themselves from
      poverty, and they are never ashamed to confess that they are poor. They
      acknowledge the equal dignity of all kinds of labor, and do not presume
      upon any social differences between their baker and themselves. Knowing
      that luxury enervates a nation, they aim to show in their lives, as in
      their persons, that simplicity is the finest ornament of dress, as health
      best decorates the body. They are cheerfully obedient to those who command
      them, and gentle to those they command. Full of charity, and knowing that
      if every man has some sore weakness, he has also a human soul latent in
      him, they trust each man as if that soul might, at any moment, look out of
      his eyes, and acknowledge with tears, the sympathy that unites them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They show in all this social independence and originality, the shrewd
      common-sense which we have so often heard ascribed to them. For if, by
      some fatal error, they should undertake a social rivalry, in kind, with
      the old world and all its splendid accessories of antiquity, wealth and
      hereditary refinement, the observer would see, what now is never beheld,
      foolish parvenus frenzied in the pursuit of an elegance which, in its
      nature, is inaccessible to them. We should see lavish and unmeaning
      displays. We should see a gaudy ostentation,&mdash;serving only as a
      magnificent frame to the vanity of the subject. We should see the grave
      and thoughtful, the witty and accomplished, the men and women whose genius
      fitted them for society, withdrawing from its saloons, and preferring
      privacy to a vulgar and profuse publicity. We should see society become a
      dancing school, and men and women degenerated into dull and dandified boys
      and girls, content with (pardon me, sable sir, but it would be the truth)
      "style." We should see, as if in an effete civilization, marriages of
      convenience. We should hear the heirs, or the holders, of great fortunes,
      called "gentlemanly," if they were dull, and "a little wild" if they were
      debauched. We should see parents panting to "marry off" their dear
      daughters to the richest youths, and the richest youths affecting a
      "jolly" and "stunning" life,&mdash;reputed to know the world because they
      are licentious, and to have seen life because they have tasted foreign
      dissipation. We should hear insipidity praised as good-humor, and
      nonchalance as ease. We should have boorishness accounted manliness, and
      impudence wit. We should gradually lose faith in man as we associated with
      men, and soon perceive that the only safety for the city was in its
      constant recruiting from the simplicity and strength of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sharp common-sense of this people prevents so melancholy a spectacle.
      In fact, you have only to consider that this society does not remind you
      of the best characteristics of any other, to judge how unique it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, for myself, as milk disagrees with my constitution, and my mind tires
      of this pastoral sweetness, I am too glad to obey your summons. In my
      younger days when I loved to press the stops of oaten pipes, and&mdash;a
      plaintive swain&mdash;fancied every woman what she seemed, and every man
      my friend,&mdash;I should have hailed the prospect of a life in an Arcadia
      like this. How gladly I should have climbed its Pisgah-peaks of hope, and
      have looked off into the Future, flowing with milk and honey. I would
      grieve (if I could) that my sated appetite refuses more,&mdash;that I must
      lay down my crook and play the shepherd no longer. Yet I know well enough
      that in the perfumed atmosphere of the circle to which I return, I shall
      recur often, with more than regret, to the humane, polished, intelligent,
      and simple society I leave behind me,&mdash;shall wonder if Miss Minerva
      Tattle still prattles kindly among the birds and flowers,&mdash;if Mrs.
      Potiphar still leads, by her innate nobility, and not by the accident of
      wealth, the swarm of gay, and graceful, and brilliant men and women that
      surround her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I humbly trust, sable son of midnight, my lord and master, that my present
      report and summary will be found worthy of that implicit confidence
      immemorially accorded to diplomatic communications. I could ask for it no
      other reception.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      VII. &mdash; FROM THE REV. HENRY DOVE TO MRS. POTIPHAR.
    </h2>
    <p>
      (PRIVATE.)
    </p>
    <p>
      EDENSIDE.
    </p>
    <p>
      MY DEAR MRS. POTIPHAR:
    </p>
    <p>
      I am very anxious that you should allow me to receive your son Frederic as
      a pupil, at my parsonage, here in the country. I have not lived in the
      city without knowing something about it, despite my cloth, and I am
      concerned at the peril to which every young man is there exposed. There is
      a proud philosophy in vogue that everything that <i>can</i> be injured had
      better be destroyed as rapidly as possible, and put out of the way at
      once. But I recall a deeper and tenderer wisdom which declared, "A bruised
      reed will he not break." The world is not made for the prosperous alone,
      nor for the strong. We may wince at the truth, but we must at length
      believe it,&mdash;that the poor in spirit, and the poor in will, and the
      poor in success, are appointed as pensioners upon our care.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my house your son will miss the luxuries of his home, but he will,
      perhaps, find as cordial a sympathy in his little interests, and as
      careful a consultation of his desires and aims. He will have pure air, a
      tranquil landscape, a pleasant society; my books, variously selected, my
      direction and aid in his studies, and a neighborhood to town that will
      place its resources within his reach. A city, it seems to me, is mainly
      valuable as a gallery of opportunities. But a man should not live
      exclusively in his library, nor among his pictures. Letters and art may
      well decorate his life. But if they are not subsidiary to the man, and his
      character, then he is a sadder spectacle than a vain book or a poor
      picture. The eager whirl of a city tends either to beget a thirst that can
      only be sated by strong, yet dangerous excitement, or to deafen a man's
      ear, and harden his heart, to the really noble attractions around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is well to know men. But men are not learned at the billiard table, nor
      in the barroom, nor by meeting them in an endless round of debauch, nor
      does a man know the world because he has been to Paris. It is a sad thing
      for a young man to seek applause by surpassing his companions in that
      which makes them contemptible. The best men of our own time have little
      leisure, and the best of other days have committed their better part to
      books, wherein we may know and love them.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is nothing more admirable than good society, as there is nothing so
      fine as a noble man, nor so lovely as a beautiful woman. And to the
      perfect enjoyment of such society an ease and grace are necessary, which
      are hardly to be acquired, but are rather, like beauty and talent, the
      gift of Nature. That ease and grace will certainly run great risk of
      disappearing, in the embrace of a fashion unchastened by common sense; and
      it is observable that the sensitive <i>gaucherie</i> of a countryman is
      more agreeable than the pert composure of a citizen.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not deny that your son must lose something, if you accede to my
      request, but I assuredly believe that he will gain more than he will lose.
      My profession makes me more dogmatic, probably, than is strictly
      courteous. But I have observed, in my recent visits to town, that
      Courtesy, also, is getting puny and unmanly, and that a counterfeit,
      called Compliment, is often mistaken for it. You will smile, probably at
      my old-fashioned whims, and regret that I am behind my time. But really,
      it strikes me, that the ineffectual imitation of an exploded social
      organization is, at least, two centuries behind my time. The youth who,
      socially speaking, are termed Young America, represent, in character and
      conduct, anything but their own time and their own country.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will not deny that the secret of my interest in your son, is an earlier
      interest in yourself&mdash;a wild dream we dreamed together, so long ago
      that it seems not to be a part of my life. The companion of those other
      days I do not recognize in the glittering lady I sometimes see. But in her
      child I trace the likeness of the girl I knew, and it is to the memory of
      that girl&mdash;whose lovely traits I will still believe are not
      destroyed, but are somewhere latent in the woman&mdash;that I consecrate
      the task I wish to undertake. I am married, and I am happy. But sometimes
      through the sweet tranquillity of my life streams the pensive splendor of
      that long-vanished summer, and I cannot deny the heart that will dream of
      what might have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame, I can wish you nothing more sincerely than that as your lot is
      with the rich in this world, it may be with the poor in the world to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your obedient servant,
    </p>
    <p>
      HENRY DOVE.

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
