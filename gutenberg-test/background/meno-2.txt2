For Small Mercies

By Israel Zangwill






Thinking of Poland and her tortured Jews,
'Twixt Goth and Cossack hounded, crucified
On either frontier, e'en the Pale denied,
Wand'ring with bloodied staff and broken shoes,
Scarred like their greatest son with stripe and bruise,
Though thrice a hundred thousand fight beside
Their Russian brethren and are glorified
By death for those who flout them and abuse,       
I suddenly was touched to thankful tears.
Not that one wave had ebbed of all this woe,
Not that one heart had softened in "the spheres"[A]
One touch of bureau-malice to forego,
But that amid blind eyes, dumb mouths, deaf ears,
One voice in England[B] said these things were so.

From Across the Seas

From Dr. Max Nordau

Madrid, Spain





I HAIL most cordially the appearing of The Menorah Journal with the
noble and impressive program which you develop. It shows your
consciousness of the new duties of the rich, free and powerful
American Jewry, your readiness to assume fully the moral
responsibilities which your privileged position imposes upon you, and
your comprehension of the needs of the present hour. Your journal
seems the promising beginning of that organization in which we are so
sorely wanting and without which we will achieve nothing in the
forthcoming deep transformations of the old world.






From Dr. Moses Gaster

Chief Rabbi (Haham) Spanish and Portuguese Congregations of the
British Empire





I AM glad to see that you have brought out again the Menorah from the
corner into which it had been thrust, that you have polished up the
old candlestick, nay, even more, that you have trimmed the wick and
poured the oil into the cup, that you are kindling a light which is to
dissipate the darkness spiritual, more dangerous, more terrible than
darkness physical. What our people really want is to be able to see
that light of truth, that light of hope, of humanity, of knowledge, of
idealism, which has been ours through the ages. We have never allowed
our lamp to be extinguished, whether it burned in a remote corner in
the ghetto, smoky, ill trimmed, even evil smelling; still there was
the light sufficiently strong to illumine the pages of the Torah and
the Talmud, even[73] the pages of the writers of philosophy and science.
It was quite sufficient if one lamp was kept alight. This is the
greatness and the beauty of it,       that from one, one can kindle a
thousand.

There is no limit to which the light cannot reach and there will be no
limit, I hope, to the light which you will now spread. It will reach
the remotest corner of the universities and schools of learning, nay,
even more, it will bring everywhere a measure of knowledge and of
truth, and above all it will illumine and warm. It will reach the eyes
of those who have hitherto refused to see the beauty of their own past
and the greatness of their own future. They may then learn to live in
the present by the teaching of the past and by the hope of the future.
Make both known.

In conclusion, I can only express the wish that you keep steadily and
exclusively to Jewish questions, Jewish problems, Jewish learning.
Make your readers know what they can find in Jewish literature and
make the students of the various universities realize that in the
libraries of Europe and America there are vast treasures accumulated
which await the hand and the heart of the Jewish scholars. There are
great and grave problems which await solution and the field is
unlimited. Let them begin to till the ground of our own field, and
turn the furrows and sow the seed, and the golden harvest is sure to
repay them for their labor in the service of love and truth, and above
all of devotion to Judaism.






From Norman Bentwich

Professor of International Law, School of Law, Cairo, Egypt





YOU are indeed happy in the moment of your appearance. I am not of
those who regard this world war as a terrible catastrophe. I can see
in it with God's grace the preparation of a great uplift of humanity
and especially the coming of redemption for Israel. But the more
glorious the vision of the future the greater the need of light, and
more light, to illuminate the present and to enable the young
generation to advance steadily towards the vision and make it reality.
That is what I believe the function of the Menorah Journal to be, and
your first number is an earnest of the sincerity of your aim and the
goodness of your means.

The Jewish people stand on the brink of a new era in which they are to
resume their true function of the spiritual teacher of mankind. And[74]
American Jewry, it is a truism to say, has a vital and a leading part
to play in moulding the destiny of the Jewish people. So we may adapt
the old Rabbinic saying: "He who saves the soul of a single Jewish
student is as though he saved the world." The Menorah Journal in
holding up the light of the Jewish spirit to the young men and women
of America is doing the work of humanity.

May I express the hope that the Menorah Societies will direct the gaze
of their members to the land of promise and the land of the prophets,
where the inspiration of Judaism has always come and whither the hopes
of Jewry have always turned. Living as I do, in the reflection of
Palestine as well as in the shadow of the Pyramids, I am very
conscious of the need for a continued Passover from the ideas of the
various Egypts that beset the Jewish people to the message that calls
us, in spirit if not in body, to the land of our fathers. To-day in
Palestine the light has begun to shine brightly again. Judaism has
relit there its prophetic lamp, which in centuries of stress and
darkness has never been permitted to fade away altogether. In our own
time the Menorah has been re-established in the Temple of the land by
a new band of Maccabees. But a single branch, so to say, of the seven
branches as yet shows its clear light. But if the Jewish youth wills
it, the whole Menorah may be lighted and shine full and clear to the
world with fresh lustre. In our day there may be a new Hanukka, a
rededication of the Hebraic light       if only we will it.

The Jewish Problem Today

By Jacob H. Schiff




JACOB HENRY SCHIFF (born in Frankfort-on-the-Main,
Germany, in 1847, came to America in 1865), one of the world's leading
bankers (senior member of Kuhn, Loeb       Co., New York), and a prince of
philanthropists, noted for his personal devotion and munificent gifts
to many causes for human betterment. He was among the first to
encourage and befriend the Menorah movement, founding in 1907 the
annual Menorah Society Prize at Harvard. The present article forms the
approved substance of an interview granted by Mr. Schiff to the
Editors of The Menorah Journal on March 4, 1915. Mr. Schiff's
statement regarding the need for a separate Jewish Relief Fund is
given special significance by the fact that he is Treasurer of the
American Red Cross.


IT is hardly possible to exaggerate the horrors of the Jewish
conditions in the war-stricken countries, especially in the three
Polands. According to the reports we get, conditions in Russian Poland
are such that Belgium's plight is a mere bagatelle in comparison.
The Jewish people there have been outraged in the most terrible
manner, both by the Poles who denounced them to the Russians as
enemies and spies and then by the Russians themselves, who treated
them as such. It is only after the Russian armies are forced to leave
that the Jews are given protection by the Germans. In saying this I do
not want to be misjudged, for it is well known that I am a German
sympathizer. But the fact is that the Russians and the Poles alike
have been inhumane to the Jewish population.

According to the latest reports, the conditions are not being improved
in any way. And the relief so far has been entirely inadequate. It has
never been adequate. We need millions for the immediate relief of our
brethren, and so far only about half a million has been forthcoming
from American Jews. This in spite of the fact that all parties and
factions in Jewry are acting together in the work of relief, except
only one organization, the B'nai B'rith, and for this there is some
reason, because the B'nai B'rith have their own lodges abroad and they
want evidently to apply their relief to their own members first.


"We Must Have a Jewish Relief Fund of Our Own"

WE must have a Jewish Relief Fund of our own in addition to the Relief
Funds for other people in the war-stricken countries, because the
Jewish problem forms everywhere a problem of its own. It would be[76]
rather hard to say whether, were it not for the specific Jewish Relief
Fund, the Jews would get as much relief as the other suffering people,
but there is very little doubt that the Jews in the war-stricken
districts, especially in Poland, have suffered a great deal more than
the rest of the population. The Jews, therefore, need more relief,
particularly as the civilian population has been against them.

Beyond the immediate measures for relief we can for the present do
nothing. We must act from day to day. As the war goes on we must
simply keep on trying to relieve the distress. As to what is in store
after the war, I am unable to form a picture, at least so far as
Russia is concerned. The hope is expressed that when peace is restored
Russia will do better than heretofore for her large Jewish population.
But we have been disappointed so often by Russia's promises that we
should believe this only when actually done and not before. I have
little confidence at all in the assertion that Russia will mend her
way in the future.


"There Is Only One Way to Solve the Jewish Problem in Russia"

THERE is only one way to solve the Jewish problem in Russia and that
is nothing less than the entire removal of the Pale. We must ever
demand this and accept nothing else. When the Jew can go where he
pleases, and trade where he pleases, and live where he pleases, the
Jewish question in Russia will be solved. It is the government, the
governing classes, in Russia that create the enmity towards the Jews.
I believe there is no people anywhere who have at present or ever had
less anti-Jewish feeling than the mass of Russian people. When once
the pressure brought by the bureaucracy is removed and the Jews are
permitted to have normal relations with the mass of the Russian
population all over the country, the Jewish question will be a thing
of the past.

The situation is different in Poland and Roumania, where the people
themselves are anti-Semitic. It may appear strange at first that there
should be such a difference between the Polish people and the Russian
people in their attitude towards the Jews in their midst. But it may
be easily explained. People who are oppressed generally become narrow
by the oppression. The Poles and the Roumanians have had long to
suffer from oppression to a great extent, the Poles from Russia and
the Roumanians for many years from Turkey, from whose yoke they were
freed only a few decades ago. It is generally a fact that when the
servant becomes a master he makes the most intolerant master. Even if
a Polish autonomous kingdom should be created, it could not be much
worse for the Jewish population than it is now. But the Russian people
have been happy. They have gotten used to their despotic government
and do not feel it in particular, and they have little prejudice
against their still greater oppressed Jewish neighbors.[77]

The great numbers of Jews who have gone into the war and are fighting
heroically will, I have no doubt, make a convincing demonstration of
Jewish patriotism in every country, and that should make for an
improvement of Jewish conditions all over, except possibly in Russia.


"I Am Afraid England Has Been Contaminated By Her Alliance With
Russia"

BUT I am afraid that England too has been contaminated by her alliance
with Russia, because England doesn't want to do anything that is
displeasing to her ally, more through fear to offend her than through
respect for her. So far, at least, it has not come true, as it was
hoped in certain quarters, that England might apply pressure upon
Russia to obtain an improvement in the condition of the Jews. And
unfortunately the conditions in England itself affecting the Jews are
certainly not as good now as they have been formerly. England has
always been our great friend. In England there existed no such thing
as anti-Semitism. But now there are, I fear, signs of a change.

In Germany the Jews do not suffer. They have a high standing and
occupy many high positions. There has, it is true, always been a
certain anti-Semitic tendency in Germany. But I think this war will
crush out most of that, in fact all class differences. I am quite
convinced that anti-Semitism in Germany is a thing of the past.


"When Peace Negotiations Begin, We Should Take United Action"

WHAT part America and the American Jews should play in the efforts to
bring about a permanent betterment of Jewish conditions elsewhere, it
is hard to say. America has already gone pretty far by breaking off
commercial treaty relations with Russia. Whether the United States
could or should go further is difficult to judge at this time. It is
certainly clear that the solution of the Jewish problem in Russia
along the lines already suggested would solve the passport problem and
would pave the way for the resumption of regular treaty and commercial
relations between the two countries.

I do not think there is anything to do now for the Jews and for Jewish
bodies in America except to work harmoniously together in the raising
of relief funds. Of course, we must always be on the alert and ready
to take a definite position whenever the proper time arrives. But not
now. When peace negotiations begin to be talked about, I think it will
be well for such bodies as the American Jewish Committee, possibly the
B'nai B'rith and other organizations, to take united action. What
action they should take it is hard to say. It is a very difficult
question to decide at[78] this moment whether or not it would be
advisable to have special Jewish representatives present at the peace
negotiations to look after the specific Jewish interests. Whatever
influence should be brought to bear at the proper time should
originate with the American Jewish Committee, which is the most
suitable unifying Jewish agent in America to-day.


"Arouse the Jews of America From Their Apathy"

FOR the present, however, I repeat, what we need is to raise relief
funds to a much larger extent than we have done so far. There has been
too much apathy among the American Jews. They have done much less than
at the time of the Kishineff massacres, when almost a million and a
half was raised. Now, with conditions infinitely worse, we have thus
far not been able to raise half as much as was readily given then.
Unfortunately we have become used to horrors and they do not touch us
any more as deeply as they should. Moreover, we have weighty and
costly problems of our own at home. We have to expend such enormous
sums for home problems that American Jewry seems unable to bear much
more. But notwithstanding this more must be forthcoming. We Jews must
give until it hurts, until it really becomes self-sacrifice; we must
stir up our people to the terrible condition of our brethren abroad.
And the Menorah Societies, which represent the most intelligent and
idealistic Jewish youth of the land, should do their share in making
known the tragic conditions and in arousing the Jews of America from
their apathy.

Nationality and the Hyphenated American

By Horace M. Kallen




HORACE MEYER KALLEN (born in Silesia, Germany, in
1882, came to America in 1887), studied at Harvard (A. B., Ph.D.),
Princeton, Oxford, and Paris. He has been assistant and lecturer in
philosophy at Harvard, instructor in logic at Clark University, and
since 1911 of the faculty of philosophy at the University of
Wisconsin. At the request of the late William James, he edited his
unfinished book on "Some Problems of Modern Philosophy." Besides
contributing to philosophical and general periodicals, Dr. Kallen is
the author of a recently published book on "William James and Henri
Bergson." Dr. Kallen was one of the founders of the Harvard Menorah
Society, and has rendered signal service, both by tongue and pen, to
the Menorah movement.

THE United States of America are at peace with all the world. Our
government is not taking sides in the great war; officially we are the
friends of all the embattled powers. And yet       we have but to take up
any newspaper, anywhere in America, to find violent praise of one
side, violent blame of the other. The sentiment of our country is
divided. On all sides, our diverse populations are emphasizing afresh
their European origins and background. The German in German-American,
the Slav in Slavic-American, the Briton in British-American, have
awakened, have become demonstrative and emphatic. The President,
observing this, has declared his official and personal boredom with
the "hyphenated American," and the conception expressed in this phrase
has become an issue in the written and spoken discourse of our
country.

Why, in an officially neutral country, has this come to pass? When we
look closely to the ground and principle of the division of sentiment
in our population, we discover this significant fact: the division is
not truly determined by the merits of the European issue; it is
determined by the lines of our population's European origin and
ancestral allegiance. The Americans of German and Austrian and Magyar
ancestry are pro-German; those of French or British or Russian
ancestry favor the Allies. Only the Jews seem to be an exception to
this rule. Being mainly from Russia, their favor should go to the
Russians, but their newspapers, almost without exception, favor the
Germans. The case of the Jews, however, is an exception that proves
the rule. Although the majority of them came from Russia, they have
had no part in the Russian polity; they have been oppressed,
persecuted, terrorized, as their brethren still are in Russian
territory. As[80] Americans, what portion and what hope have they in
Russia that they should desire Russian victory? None. But they are not
for this reason in favor of Germany. The headlines of their newspapers
do not celebrate German victories, but Russian defeats. The Ghetto's
partiality to Germany is a consequence of its loyalty to Jewry.
Kinship of blood and race, ancestral allegiance, determine with the
Jewish masses in America also, what side they take in this war.
Although they have no political background in Europe, and their civil
allegiance is absolutely American, they too are hyphenated in
sentiment       Jewish-Americans.

Such is the fact. Its significance lies in what it reveals, and what
it reveals is a force much deeper and more radical, distinctly more
primitive and original, than anything else in the structure of
society. It hyphenates English and Germans and Austrians and Russians
and Turks no less than it hyphenates Americans, and, in the failure of
the external socio-political organization of Europe to give it free
play, it is the chief, almost the only, cause of the present
unendurable European tragedy. Its name is nationality.


Two Mosaics of Nationalities: A Contrast

NATIONALITY is not nationhood, although it is the most important
constituent of nationhood. Many nationalities may compose a nation
(such is the case of the British, Russian, Austro-Hungarian and
Turkish Empires, of the Swiss Republic, of our own Union), and then
the relation between the nationalities will determine the strength or
the weakness of the nation. Again, a single nationality may be divided
among many nations (such is the case of the Poles, of the Serbs and
other Slavs, of the Jews), and then the stability of the nations will
be largely determined by their effect on the nationalities divided
among them.

The Swiss Republic, for example, is a nation composed of three
nationalities, two of which belong to powers at war with each other.
These are the French and the German; the third is the Italian. Yet the
nationhood of Switzerland is the most integral and unified in Europe
to-day, because Switzerland is as complete and thorough a democracy as
exists in the civilized world, and the efficacious safeguard of
nationhood is democracy not only of individuals but of nationalities.
The German, French and Italian citizens of the Swiss Republic are
to-day under arms to defend the neutrality of their nation from
possible violation by German, French or Italian belligerents, and in
defending their nation, they are defending also the autonomy of each
other's nationality. In Switzerland, nationhood, being democratic, is
the safeguard and insurance of nationality.

Contrast Swiss nationhood with Austro-Hungarian nationhood.
Austria-Hungary is the immediate and direct occasion of the great war
by reason of the fact that, although she is a mosaic of nationalities
like[81] Switzerland, her government, instead of being a democracy, has
in the long run been directed toward the control and exploitation of
many nationalities by one or two. Hungary contains a population of
seven million Magyars among twelve million Slavs; yet the Hungarians,
having the economic and political upper hand, have sought to Magyarize
by force and trickery this almost doubly greater and culturally equal
population. They have tried to compel Magyar forms and standards in
language, in literature, in history, the arts, the sciences, religion,
law, in every intimate or remote concern of the daily life and
national genius of their Slavic subjects. The result has been the
steady disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian mosaic, the increasing
use of force to hold it together, the corresponding increase of
restlessness among the subject-peoples, plot and counterplot, the
assassination of the Archduke, and the attack on Serbia, which
precipitated the war. In this war Austria has come off worst of all
the combatants, and for the same reason: the attempt to maintain the
unity of a nation of nationalities by the force of one of them instead
of by the democratic co      peration of all. In Austria-Hungary,
nationality, having been exploited and suppressed, has been the enemy
and destroyer of nationhood.


America A Commonwealth of Nationalities

IN this country the whole spirit of those institutions which
constitute American nationhood makes for the liberation and harmonious
co      peration of nationalities. This spirit is also a part of the
Hebraic spirit, a part of the explicit program of our prophets, those
champions and vindicators of social justice and international
righteousness and peace; and this, significantly, is the spirit that
literally inspired the democracy of our America.

For the democracy of America had its first articulate voicing in the
Pilgrim Fathers and the Puritans of New England. These men and women,
devoted to the literature of the Old Testament, and upheld by the
ancestral memories of the Jews, were moved to undertake their great
American adventure by the ideal of nationality. It was not because of
an overwhelming oppression of body and soul that the Pilgrims
adventured to America. It was not "freedom to worship God" that they
sought. They had that in Holland. They sought freedom to be
themselves, to realize their national genius in their own individual
way. Their English manners, English speech, English history, and
English loyalty were, in fact, more important to them than their
Hebrew Bible. They used that as the spiritual pabulum which nourished
their English corporate life. Their Calvinism was a reinterpretation
of its prophetic nationalism expressed in the doctrine of the "chosen
people"; their political institutions were a modification of the ideal
political order it was supposed to reveal. As Cotton Mather narrates,[82]
his grandfather, John Cotton, found, on his arrival in New England,
that the population was much exercised over the framing of a "civil
constitution." They turned to him for help, begging "that he would,
from the laws wherewith God governed his ancient people, form an
abstract of such as were of a moral and lasting equity." So "he
propounded unto them an endeavor after a theocracy, as near as might
be to that which was the glory of Israel." Out of this beginning the
democratic mood of America surges; in such conceptions the ideals
which express the mood have their origins. These ideals are the
conservation of nationality, and the equality of men before the
inconceivable supremacy of their God. Hebraism and English
nationality       these are the spiritual background of the American
commonwealth.

Political freedom in America has tended to generate self-expression of
each national group, and our country is to-day, broadly speaking, a
great co      perative commonwealth of nationalities, British, French,
German, Slavic, Jewish, each freely developing, in so far as it is
self-conscious, its national genius, its language, literature and art
in its own characteristic way as its best contribution to the
civilization of America as a whole,[C] realizing in this way the ideal
of the democracy of nationalities, of international comity and
co      peration which our prophets were the first to formulate.

American nationhood, thus, is in the way of becoming what Swiss
nationhood fully is, the liberator and protector of nationality; its
democracy is its strength, and its democracy is "hyphenation."
"Hyphenation" may, it is true, become perverse. As an expression of
the co      peration of nationality with nationality in the life of the
State, it is inevitable and good; as an attempt to subordinate all
nationalities to one, to use all for the advantage of one, it is
partial, undemocratic, disloyal. Our nation is a democracy of
nationalities having for its aim the equal growth and free development
of all. It can take no sides. To require it to take sides, German or
Anglo-Saxon, Slavic or Jewish, is to be untrue to its spirit and to
pervert its ideal.


The Renaissance of Nationality in the Past Century

IT is the attempt of one nationality to dominate and to impose its
character, culture and ideals upon others that has been the basis of
all the great wars in Europe, of all international injustice from the
beginning of history.

The movement in modern history which we call progressive has been a
movement toward democracy in both the internal affairs and external
relationships of nations. Men did not realize its entire significance
until the nineteenth[83] century; only then did it come to full
consciousness in fact and idea, urged equally in Greece, in Germany,
in Ireland, in Italy. Its great voice is the Italian thinker and
patriot, Mazzini. In a marvelous essay entitled "Europe, Its Condition
and Its Prospects," he wrote, at a time when the hope of social and
international democracy seemed extinguished: "They struggled, they
still struggle, for country and liberty; for a word inscribed upon a
banner, proclaiming to the world that they also live, think, love and
labor for the benefit of all. They speak the same language, they bear
about them the impress of consanguinity, they kneel beside the same
tombs, they glory in the same tradition; and they demand to associate
freely, without obstacles, without foreign domination, in order to
elaborate and express their idea, to contribute their stone also to
the great pyramid of history. It is something moral which they are
seeking; and this moral something is in fact, politically speaking,
the most important question in the present state of things. It is the
organization of the European task. In principle, nationality ought to
be to humanity that which division of labor is in a workshop       the
recognized symbol of association; the assertion of the individuality
of a human group called by its geographical position, its traditions
and its language, to fulfill a special function in the European work
of civilization."

Modern Europe saw the overthrow of the Holy Roman Empire, of the
imperial aspirations of Louis XIV, and of Napoleon before it realized
the natural fact and moral principle which underlay these overthrows,
and which finally so successfully asserted themselves as to unify
Italy and cast off the Austrian dominion, to liberate Greece,
Bulgaria, Roumania and the other Balkan States from the Turk, to unify
and create contemporary Germany. The last quarter of the nineteenth
century saw the renaissance, often in the face of overwhelming
suppression, of the language and cultures of Czechs, Bohemians, Poles,
Irish and Jews. It saw the rise of nationalism in the Oriental
dependencies of Great Britain. It saw the beginning of an
acknowledgment of the full rights of nationalities by both Austria and
Great Britain, the grant of local autonomy to the various
nationalities in the Austrian Empire, of progressive home rule to
India and South Africa and Ireland. The twentieth century seemed to be
moving peacefully toward the fulness of democracy       when came the war.


The Present War: Nationality vs. Imperialism

LET no one be deceived into believing that this war is a struggle for
the economic domination of the world, springing from commercial
rivalry and industrial intrigue. No. Nothing is so international as
economic life       we in America know that now to our own cost also       and
if commercial interests and capitalistic counsels had had their say,
there would have been no war. England was Germany's best customer,
France her[84] great creditor, Russia supplied her with unskilled labor.
The socialist international was against war, the peace party was
against it, the intelligence of the world was against it. When it
came, it shattered all these international organizations into national
units, it smashed the solidarity of even science and art, which are
the most international enterprises in the world. And why? Because its
cause was something deeper than economic interest or the other
secondary interests. Here is the question that the war is to decide:
Is the whole of mankind to be dominated in body and in spirit, without
its consent, by a portion of it, and to be compelled "to elaborate and
express the idea" of the portion? or is the whole of mankind to be
self-governed, in a co      perative commonwealth, each part of which, by
elaborating and expressing its own idea, contributes its best to the
whole?

This is the issue between the warring powers and each claims that it
is defending itself against the aggression of its opponents. Each
claims to be fighting for democracy. In the face of these claims,
history has the deciding voice. Now, historically, England, more than
any other power, has stood for the democratic and co      perative idea.
Her colonies have autonomy, her more backward dependencies are
encouraged toward autonomy. Since the Boer war, when imperialism
passed away, she has moved toward the position of Switzerland. Even
Ireland has obtained home rule. "We are a great world-wide,
peace-loving partnership," said Mr. Asquith,[D] has reiterated again
and again the principle for which all the Allies are fighting:
believing that "the preservation of local and national ties, of the
genius of a people which has a history of its own, is not only not
hostile to or inconsistent with, but on the contrary, fosters and
strengthens and stimulates the spirit of a common purpose, of a
corporate brotherhood," the Allies seek to defend public right, to
find and to keep "room for the independent existence and free
development of the smaller nationalities, each with a corporate
consciousness of its own .      .      . and, perhaps, by a slow and gradual
process, the substitution for force, for the clash of competing
ambitions, for groupings and alliances and a precarious equipoise, of
a real European partnership, based on equal right and enforced by a
common will."[E]

It is hard to believe that Russia can be fighting for such an end.
Fear of Russian barbarism is what brought Germany into the lists, the
Germans declare, to defend western ideals and western democracy. Yet
Russian government is Prussian in its organization, and it is on the
side of the ideal of western democracy that she is explicitly aligned.
The contradiction is striking, and it is still more striking when we
recall that in her armies are over a quarter of a million of Jews, and
that in the other armies there are half as many more. For the Jews the
war is more than civil; it is[85] fratricide. On the face of it they have
no inevitable personal or political stake in the war's fortune.
England has acknowledged their "corporate consciousness" and given
them maximal opportunity for "free self-development"; so has France.
Russia has oppressed and horribly exploited them; Germany, though
infinitely better than Russia, has set them conditions in which "free
development" is synonymous with complete Germanization. Austria and
Turkey have dealt with them somewhat after the manner of England and
France. The contradiction of the Jewish position outdistances that of
the Russian. But both contradictions are resolved in the fact that the
ideal in question concerns not Russia alone, nor England alone, nor
the Jews alone, but the whole of Europe, the whole world. What is at
stake is not something local, personal, political, but a universal
principle, the goal toward which mankind has been so slowly and
deviously crawling from the beginnings of modern history       the
principle of democracy in nationality and nationality in democracy.

It is for this that our brethren in the armies are fighting; it is for
this that they are undergoing crucifixion in the Pale, for this that
our people have suffered and died from the beginnings of our history.
Our whole recorded biography is the narrative of a struggle for social
justice against the exploitation of class by class within our polity,
for nationality against imperialism without. Our statesmen and leaders
were the first to formulate the ideal of the co      perative harmony of
nationality, and the ideal of international peace.[F] Mr. Asquith is
echoing our prophets, and our embattled brethren are engaged in the
defence of a principle which is the constituent of the genius of their
own nationality.


The Service of Jewish Nationality to Civilization

THE genius of their own nationality! That with all its implications is
an issue in the war not only as a principle but as a fact. The Jewish
people are the great historic incarnation of the casus belli. In
fortune and in disaster, through difficult and terrible centuries,
they have cherished their language, their history, their culture, have
sustained their "corporate consciousness" and in terms of it have
served civilization in all the institutions of civilization. Not
freely, not by free development; not because of conditions, but in
spite of them. The Bible, whose moral vision inspires the world, we
gave the world only as we had or yearned for "independent existence"
and "free development." Our best, like the best of every people, has
been a function of this "independent existence and free development."
We also, scattered among the nations, tortured and oppressed by the
mighty and the weak among them, are among "the smaller nationalities"
for whose sake the war is being fought. With Serbia, with Belgium,
with Poland, we[86] claim our public right and our national security, and
we claim it not merely for ourselves, but for the service of all
mankind. For as we have had a r       le "in the organization of the
European task," so we still have a r       le, and in that division of the
labor of civilization in terms of nationality we have our task to
accomplish, our service to render. This task, this service, is the
expression of the Jewish idea, the flowering and fruitage of the
Hebraic spirit, which, rooted in our historic past, planted on our
national soil, shall realize in modern terms, in social organization,
in religion, in the arts and the sciences, a national future that by
its inward excellence will truly make Israel "a light unto the
nations."

The indispensable condition for such a realization is autonomous
nationality; not nationhood, necessarily, but autonomy. This, more
than civil rights among other nationalities, is our stake in this
great war. In the last analysis, the Hebraic culture and ideals which
our Menorah Societies study, can be advanced, can be a living
force in civilization, only as a national force. Our duty to America,
inspired by the Hebraic tradition,       our service to the world, in
whatever occupation,       both these are conditioned, in so far as we are
Jews, upon the conservation of Jewish nationality. That is the potent
reality in each of us, our selfhood, and service is the giving of the
living self. Let us so serve mankind; as Jews, aware of our great
heritage, through it and in it strong to live and labor for mankind's
good.






I THINK I see in your Society a recognition of the
real spirit of our country's motto, e pluribus unum.
That does not mean a sinking of the differences
between us all into absolute uniformity, but rather
the harmony that can result from the recognition of
these differences and developing our own
individualities so that we shall have variety in
unity.       From an Address before the Yale Menorah
Society by Professor Benjamin W. Bacon of Yale
University.

Yankee and Jew[87]


An After-Dinner Address

By G. Stanley Hall

President of Clark University




G. STANLEY HALL (born in Ashfield, Mass., in 1846),
President of Clark University, is a leading authority on education and
psychology, and author of a number of important books, notably
"Adolescence" (2 vols. 1904). The present address, delivered at a
recent dinner of the Clark Menorah Society, has been revised by Dr.
Hall for publication in The Menorah Journal.

I FEEL an unwonted embarrassment in speaking to you to-night, first
because the light After-Dinner View of Life, which is my theme on your
program, is far from being serious enough, and I must totally abandon
my plan and speak entirely extemporaneously, although upon a subject
in which I have an old and strong interest.

Again, I am always embarrassed in talking to members of your race
because I feel a little as Napoleon did when he told his soldiers in
Egypt that forty generations looked down on them from the top of the
Pyramids. You know your ancestry in general back for thousands of
years, and I am rarely fortunate in being able to go back as much as
nine or ten generations to the Puritans of the "Mayflower," but there
I stop and everything before that is a blank. David Starr Jordan tells
us in his book that there is perhaps no man alive who has not kings or
queens in his ancestry, but adds that we all have had murderers among
our predecessors, too.


There Is Much In Common Between Yankee and Jew

THERE is much in common between the Yankees, whom I represent, and the
Jews, and this alone ought to give us a friendly feeling toward one
another. We are both misunderstood and caricatured. The Yankee stands
for a peculiar sort of closeness in money matters and a shrewdness
which has even given its slang name to a neighboring New England
State, the "Nutmeg State." Perhaps we have both done too much in the
past to deserve this reputation for super-cleverness. One of you has
referred to the fact that there are Jews who do not like to
acknowledge their race. In that respect we are alike, for there are
many Yankees[88] who are ashamed of being known as such. Long years ago,
when I was a student in Germany, I was introduced one evening to a
young German countess. She said in her broken English, "I am so glad
to meet an American. I have heard you have many funny people there,
the Dago, the Paddy, the Nigger, and many more; but I have heard that
the lowest people there are what they call the 'damn Yankees.' How I
would like to see one of them!" This, bear in mind, was soon after our
Civil War, and she received her impression of us doubtless from
Confederates. I did not have the courage to acknowledge my nationality
to her, but diverted the topic to some of the other people she had
mentioned.

The old New England Puritan taught sternly. He was a patriarchal head
of his family. In my boyhood, Saturday evening or perhaps better
Thanksgiving Day, when their descendants all gathered together as long
as either of the grandparents lived, we had an illustration of
something very like Heine's touching picture of an old Jewish peddler
who worked hard through the week, but on Friday night put on his long
black coat and his three-cornered hat, lit the seven candles at the
table, and told his children and grandchildren how Jehovah had led His
people through the wilderness, and how the Egyptians and all the other
naughty people who persecuted them were long since dead, while the
chosen race survived. And so happy in his race was this poor peddler
and so proud of his pedigree that, as Heine says, had the great
Rothschild entered at that moment and asked him what favor he could
do, he would reply simply: "Stand out of my light, that I may finish
telling the law to my children."


The Eugenics of the Jewish Race

WE Puritans were brought up on the Old Testament, the spirit of which,
far more than that of the New, pervaded the life of old New England.
Every day after breakfast, no matter how busy the season or how late
the breakfast, my grandfather read to the assembled family a chapter
from the Old Testament, and perhaps remarked upon certain passages.
After graduating from college and when I became a tutor in a prominent
Hebrew family in New York, and especially when I had to teach the
children their Sunday school lessons and freshen up the small
knowledge of the Hebrew language that I had, I realized very keenly
how closely related were the Jews to the Yankees,       with this
tremendous difference, that you are increasing in numbers while we are
decreasing.

As I read the Old Testament, the substance of the covenant with
Abraham was that if he kept Jehovah's law, his seed would be
multiplied like the stars of Heaven. This placed society and life in
that early day squarely on a eugenic basis, for it makes the number
and success of good children the supreme test of every human
institution, activity, and every[89] kind of culture. This I take it is
one of the chief characteristics of your race, and I hope it may long
be so.

I am going to avail myself of this opportunity to say a few words
about a topic that has for centuries been a point of the very greatest
difference and tension between your people and mine, namely, the
character and work of Jesus. Please do not be shocked till you hear
what I have to say. Such of us psychologists as have recently been
interested in the psychological aspect of Jesus' life and work
understand, as had never been understood before, how purely Jewish he
was. Scholars have lately given to his figure a radically new
interpretation.


"An Extremely Representative Man of Your Race"

ACCORDING to many conceptions the chief trait of Jesus was a strong
and deep enthusiasm for the loftiest things of life. He was a little
ecstatic all the time, illustrating the higher powers of man. His soul
was unconquerable by misfortune and disaster, like that of the Jewish
race itself. He was also organizing victory out of defeat, and his
greatest triumph was over death itself. Some think that his youthful
dreams and ideals were to be an agrarian lord of a manor, or a grand
country gentleman of the Jewish order, making contracts with servants,
leasing out farms and vineyards, giving feasts, and the like, for more
than half the parables pertain directly or indirectly to such a
vocation. But this youthful dream he was unable on account of poverty
and his station in life to realize; so two very natural changes took
place in his soul. He came to hate the rich because they were wasting
their opportunities and never doing anything; but far more important,
he developed from these juvenile reveries his world-transforming ideas
of the kingdom, which created the church, visible and invisible, and
re-made society.

The Jews are never beaten; if checked in their aspirations they, like
the prophets in the days of captivity, strike out in higher and nobler
ways. Thus you ought to be proud of Jesus for, as he is now being
understood, he was an extremely representative man of your race. The
real enemies of the Jews are now claiming that no such man ever lived,
which is the view of Drews and his school, some holding that he was a
deliberate invention of the early decades of the first century, and
others, like Jensen, that he was a revived Babylonian myth. But these
new views show that Jesus was not an Aryan, as a few of the
pan-Germanists have claimed, but a typical Semite. It does look now,
in view of the teachings of such men as Gobineau and various of his
successors, that the Aryans are the highest and best people in the
world and that the Germans are the very best of all the Aryans, that
it is Germany that has come to consider itself the chosen people, the
elite, superior race. But certainly Germany is not very[90] Christian. It
was only converted in the thirteenth century, and Luther soon threw
off the fully developed Christianity of Rome. Since then we have had
the T      bingen School, that resolved everything into myth, and the very
many other negative points of view expressed in Nietzsche's supremest
condemnation of Jesus as a wretched degenerate, while Wagner's
deliberate slogan was, "Das Deutschtum muss das Christentum siegen."


The Rapprochement of Jew and Gentile in America

I WONDER if the time is not near at hand when your people will
reconstruct your conceptions so much as to recognize Jesus as a
typical, golden, Jewish youth, worthy of being an ideal for young men.
We certainly do have in his life as now interpreted exactly what youth
needs above all things,       ambition, enthusiasm, idealism, all of them
absorbing, all of them diverting physical and sensuous energy into the
very highest culture sphere, sublimating desire, and making us
understand that youth is not complete without a great effort at
achievement. The very essence of youth is excitement. There must be
tension, strain, a tiptoe attitude, a strong "Excelsior"-like ambition
to climb, and a corresponding horror of inferiority,
Miderwertigkeit. Youth is an age of idealism, and the tension decade
of adolescence needs a regimen and an idealization all its own, to set
back-fires to temptation. Instead of the current altogether too plain
talk on sex hygiene and teaching, we must realize that every
enthusiasm or real interest, be it in the multiplication table or in
literature, debate, athletics, is an alternative. It reduces
temptation and stores up energy as the great reservoirs in the middle
west store up the floods that come down from the mountains, so that
they shall irrigate and not devastate the land. Jesus, in the new
interpretation of Holzmann and Baumann, stands for this kind of
enthusiasm.

I cannot but wonder, therefore, whether, in view of these new
conceptions, Jew and Gentile are not going to meet in this country and
even agree about Jesus. It is difficult at least to see which of us
would change most if there were this rapprochement. We must neither
of us abandon our birthright. We must be the very best Puritan
Anglo-Saxons we possibly can, and you must be the best Jews possible,
for out of these component elements American citizenship is made up.
This country stands for the dropping of old prejudices, such as those
that are inflaming Europe now with war. If we can satisfy each other's
ideals and meet half way the thing is done, and the melting pot which
America stands for has got in its work. I want the Menorah Society to
feel that it is in the van of this movement.

"Golden Rule" Hillel

By Moses Hyamson




MOSES HYAMSON (born in Suwalki, Russia, in 1863, came
to England in childhood). Rabbi and jurist; educated at Jews' College
and University College of London; for thirteen years Senior Dayan of
the London Beth-Din (Jewish Court of Arbitration), in which capacity,
because of his erudition in both the Jewish and the common law, he
rendered notable service to the British community. In 1913 he accepted
a call from the Congregation Orach Chayim of New York. Besides being a
contributor to the Jewish Quarterly Review and other learned
publications, Dr. Hyamson has published "The Oral Law and Other
Sermons" (1901), and an annotated edition of the medieval "Collatio
Romanorum et Mosaicarum Legum" (1912).

AS the students and teachers in the famous school of Shemaya and
Abtalion assembled for worship one wintry Sabbath morning, they were
astonished to find their lecture-hall exceptionally dark. On looking
up they descried what seemed to be a human form lying prone across the
skylight. Willing feet ascended the roof and willing hands swept away
the snow from a young lad's half-frozen form. They brought him down,
and although it was the holy Sabbath, kindled a fire to revive the
chilled body. "Worthy is Hillel," they exclaimed, "that the Sabbath
should be desecrated for his sake!"

So runs the Talmudic tale. The incident happened in Palestine in the
century before the common era. The boy Hillel had come from his
obscure home in Babylon, bent upon study at the most famous school in
Palestine, whose teachers, Shemaya and Abtalion, were heads of the
Synhedrion, the Supreme Court of Jurisdiction. Poor and proud, Hillel
supported himself by manual labor while he was securing his education.
Like Abraham Lincoln, he was a woodchopper. One half of the small
amount he earned daily served for his meals, and the other half he
paid to the porter at the college for his admission in the evening. On
this short Friday in mid-winter he had been able to earn nothing, and
in his keen anxiety not to miss the lecture and discussion, he
clambered to the roof of the college hall, braving snow and cold for
the words of the living God as expounded by his teachers.

Within a few short years Hillel himself had succeeded his teachers as
the head of this famous school, and also as President of the
Synhedrion. Hillel's career is a shining example of the democratic
principle which has always prevailed in Jewish life, of the
opportunity open to all men of talents, however humble their origin,
to achieve position in the republic[92] of Jewish learning. And learning
combined with noble character, as in the case of the great Hillel,
carried authority in Jewish life. It is true that Hillel was not
without letters patent of nobility; though he came from poverty and
obscurity and from an alien land, he was, according to tradition, of
the blood of David. It is not, however, to this accident of birth,
known only later, that Hillel owed his quick rise and supreme eminence
in Jewish life, but to his distinguished attainments, to his profound
learning not only in the Jewish Law but in many secular fields of
knowledge, to his bold and original mind combined with a pious
devotion to tradition, to his indomitable energy and industry, his
nobility of character, his sympathy with the people and his
understanding of their needs.


"What To Thee Is Hateful Do Not Unto Another"

IT was Hillel who first enunciated the Golden Rule, although in
negative form. The story that is told in the Talmud is one of the most
familiar; yet no repetition can lessen its point and charm. A heathen,
it is related, came to Shammai, the leader of a rival school,
requesting to be received into Judaism and instructed in the whole of
the religion while he stood upon one leg. Shammai, an architect by
profession, threatened the heathen with his builder's measuring rod
and drove him out. The man went to Hillel with the same request.
Hillel, gentle, patient, democratic, received the man hospitably and
answered: "The whole of Judaism can be summarized in one short
sentence: 'What to thee is hateful do not unto another.' That is the
essence of the whole Torah; the rest is commentary."

And in the interpretation of that "commentary" which, together with
the Torah itself, enshrined the spirit of Judaism and made it a
throbbing reality in the life of the nation, Hillel brought out the
humanity of every regulation, the true intent behind it, whenever
literal enforcement would have worked hardship or might have defeated
its true intent because of the changed circumstances since its
enactment. While keeping faithfully within the spirit of Jewish
tradition, Hillel struck out into innovations, new precedents and
legal institutions, which testified at once to the remarkable insight
and boldness of his mind as a jurist and to his tact and sympathy as a
leader of the people. Some of his innovations anticipate in a striking
way the developments under similar circumstances of the common law of
England and the United States many centuries later.


Hillel As A Jurist: His Sense of Social Justice

FOR example, it happened that the first year after Herod's accession
was a Sabbatical year, which, according to the Deuteronomic provision
(Deut. 15, 2), set up a Statute of Limitations and effectively barred[93]
the recovery of all debts. The people, impoverished by the exactions
of the Government and by the failure of the harvest, were compelled to
have recourse to money lenders. But those who were able to accommodate
the needy were reluctant to do so on account of the imminence of the
Sabbatical year and its legal bar to the recovery of past debts.
Hillel's keen mind and sympathetic heart found a way out of this
difficulty. He set up the institution of the Prosbul, by which a
creditor received the right, when making a loan, to register the debt
in court. In this way the great jurist anticipated in a remarkable
manner a principle accepted so many centuries later in the common law
of England and America, namely, that the Statute of Limitations does
not apply to recorded judgments. Such judgments can always be sued on
and recovered. And so the new ordinance established by Hillel removed
the hardship of the Biblical enactment, the purpose of which was
humanitarian. By Hillel's innovation, the true spirit of that law was
maintained, and applied in accordance with its real intent in an age
when the economic conditions were vastly different from the time when
the law itself was established. Our modern lawyers and reformers in
this country may well take a leaf out of this progressive conservatism
of our great democratic teacher Hillel.

Other decisions of Hillel equally significant could be cited. To
lawyers especially, the study of them is fascinating; they are full of
startling relevancy in the present time of unrest and agitation for
legal reform in this country. And not without reason. What we are keen
for now is a greater measure of social justice in a democratic
community. A study of Hillel's jurisprudence       both the theory and the
decisions affecting the workaday life of the people       will give one an
appreciation not only of the beautiful spirituality of the master, his
erudition and his imagination, but the characteristic coalition of
letter and spirit, the emphatic sense of social justice, which has
prevailed in the whole system of Jewish law.


Hillel's Public Spirit and Humanity

THUS Hillel, while head of his famous school of instruction, became
the founder of a school in another sense       a school of interpretation
of the Torah. This school, as already indicated, was marked by a
leniency and elasticity of interpretation of the traditional law quite
in contrast to the harshness and rigidity of the contemporary school
of Shammai; it is the school of Hillel, leaning to the spiritual and
the humane, that has prevailed ever since in Jewish law. Hillel made
the people realize the truth of the famous text about the Torah: "It
is a tree of life to them that grasp it, and of them that uphold it,
everyone is rendered happy. Its paths are paths of pleasantness and
all its ways are peace." Those who have mistakenly conceived the
Jewish law as something dour and rigid, unlovable,[94] unspiritual,
should study the decisions and dicta of this great master.

Hillel's character is illustrated by a number of pregnant sayings of
his that have been recorded in the Talmud. "Do not separate yourself
from the community," was one of his characteristic sayings which
genuinely expressed his public spirit. His sense of individual and
social responsibility is summed up in his three famous questions: "If
I am not for myself, who will be for me? But if I am for myself alone,
what am I? And if not now, when?" His peace-loving nature and humanity
found voice in his counsel: "Be of the disciples of Aaron, loving
peace, pursuing peace, loving God's creatures and bringing them near
to the knowledge of the Law." His disinterestedness, his liberal
pursuit of the Law, that is, of knowledge, made him confidently say:
"He who aggrandizes his name, his name shall perish. He who does not
add to his store of learning and good deeds will suffer diminution. He
who does not teach deserves death. He who uses the crown of the Law
for selfish needs and personal advancement will be destroyed." Who had
a better right than Hillel, graduate of poverty, to warn his
contemporaries: "Do not say I shall learn when I will have leisure;
perhaps you never will have leisure." And in every case, even when the
conduct of a man seems most reprehensible, as when one of his
colleagues Menahem left the Synhedrion to take service under the
tyrant Herod, Hillel holds to this advice: "Judge not thy neighbor
until thou art in his place."

Many a tale is narrated of Hillel's patience, unfailing courtesy and
tact, tolerance and humility, even under the greatest provocation. The
man who bet 400 Zuz that he would break Hillel's patience by silly and
far-fetched questions lost his own temper at the consideration with
which he was treated. And so the proverb became current, "Patience is
worth 400 Zuz." And other tales are told of Hillel's considerate
dealing with heathens who wished to embrace Judaism, in contrast to
the harsh treatment meted out to them by his contemporary Shammai.


Sage and Saint

HIS perfect consideration and charity had in it even something of the
quixotic. When a man came to him for assistance, he was wont to help
him according to his previous position in life. Thus, in one instance
where a man had formerly enjoyed great wealth but had suffered
reverses, Hillel not only provided for him according to his previous
standard of living but, it is related, even hired a horse for the man
to ride on and a footman to run before him. It is added that on one
occasion, when Hillel could not obtain a runner, he himself served in
that capacity.

His wife, we learn, was a fit helpmeet to the sage and saint. Their
domestic life was a perfect harmony. Once on returning from a journey[95]
Hillel heard a sound of quarreling in the neighborhood of his house.
"I am certain," said he, "that this noise does not proceed from my
home." On another occasion Hillel sent his wife a message to prepare a
sumptuous meal for an honored guest. At the appointed hour Hillel and
his guest arrived. But the meal was not ready. "Why so late?" asked
Hillel. "I prepared a banquet," the wife replied, "according to your
desire. But I learned that a couple were to be wedded to-day and they
were too poor to provide a marriage feast, so I gave them our meal for
their wedding banquet." "Ah, my dear wife, I guessed as much."

But the greatest and most constant hospitality was shown by Hillel to
a guest who was always with him and uppermost in his thoughts. Every
day it was his habit to withdraw for a while for private meditation.
"Whither art thou going?" asked his colleagues and disciples. "I have
a guest to whom I must show attention." "Who is this guest?" "My
soul," was the solemn reply; "to-day it is with me, to-morrow the
heavenly visitant may be departed and returned home."

Is it any wonder that, after forty years of activity in the
Patriarchate, when Hillel died (in the year 10 of the common era), men
said of him: "Meek and humble-minded, a saint has departed from among
us, a disciple of Ezra the Scribe." The title fitted his career, for
he came like Ezra from Babylon to Palestine and like Ezra he restored
the Law when it was threatened with destruction. Great as a student,
he was great also as an inspirer of other students. He left eighty
distinguished disciples, of whom the youngest was that famous Jochanan
ben Zakkai who became the savior of Judaism at the destruction of the
second Temple.






Editors' Note       Dr. Hyamson's portrait of Hillel is the
first in a series of character sketches of Jewish
Worthies to appear in The Menorah Journal. The second
paper will be on Hillel's disciple, Jochanan ben
Zakkai. [96]





The Quality of Mercy

A Sixth Act to "The Merchant of Venice"

By William M. Blatt




William M. Blatt (born in Orange, N.J., in 1876)
was educated in the public schools of Boston, and received his degree
of LL.B. from Boston University Law School in 1897. Besides being
engaged with the law in Boston and contributing to a number of legal
periodicals, Mr. Blatt is also devoted to letters and has published a
number of plays, including "Husbands on Approval," and many one-act
playlets, including "The Danger of Ideals," which have been given
professional performance.

Characters: Shylock, Jessica, Antonio, Gratiano, Portia, Isaac, a
servant of Shylock.

Scene: A street in Venice.

Time: An afternoon, two years after the last act of "The Merchant of
Venice."

As curtain rises, Portia and Gratiano discovered standing and looking
down the street, Gratiano pointing.




GratianoNow Lady Portia look a long way off
And see if you can recognize a friend.
PortiaA friend? One person only do I see       
A man, quite old, who hobbles with a staff.
Gratiano He is the one I mean. Now look again
And try to recognize his face, his beard.
PortiaWhy, is it not old Shylock? Sure it is.
And met most opportunely, on my word.
Now, dear Gratiano, with this icy heart
We must needs waste a score or two of words.                                                                                                                              
GratianoTo make him help his daughter Jessica?
PortiaThat is the task.
Gratiano Too much for Hercules.
(Enter Shylock.)
PortiaA moment, Shylock, of your precious time.
You must remember meeting me before.
ShylockRemember, nay then, how could I forget
The noble judge who spoke so clean and fair
And took away on quibbles all I owned.
PortiaNot all, good Shylock, half of it remained.



ShylockOh, true, I thank you for the half you left.
I thank that kindly merchant, him that begged
The Duke to quite remit the City's fine
Which never would have done him any good       
I thank him for accepting what was all
He could have claimed, the half of my estate.
PortiaIn trust              
ShylockI know. In trust until I die.
And trust Antonio to eat it up.
Is it not known that when he takes a risk
[97]Of more than common danger and doth lose,
He makes a record that he did invest
A part of my belongings in the venture?
Belike by now there's not a ducat left.
For that however I have naught but joy
Because it means that she who was my daughter
And that Lorenzo who's her paramour
Will, when I die, inherit penury.
GratianoBut if Antonio's trust should disappear
They still would come by all you leave yourself;
'Twas thus the Duke decreed.
ShylockI know a thing
Or two that I could tell and make the face
Of son Lorenzo somewhat longer grow.
GratianoFaith, often did Lorenzo say to us
"The Jew will find a way to cheat me yet."
ShylockTo cheat him out of what? The gold he earned
By robbing me, debauching my       my child?
PortiaNay, let us not be quarreling, old man,
I have a message that I want to give.
ShylockNo message from my daughter       none to me.
PortiaI meant not message, what I have is news.
Poor Jessica has come to sorry straits.
Her husband, having heard of what you spoke,
The loss of what Antonio received,
The tricks you have been playing with your own,
Fell out with Jessica; they came to words;
From words, they say, to blows. And so it seems
He left her in a pitiable state.
Shylock(laughing wildly) Good, good, good, good. I prithee tell me more.
GratianoThe fiends fly off with thee. Hast thou a heart
And canst thou hear the sorrows of thy child
In laughter and with joy?
ShylockShe is no child
Of mine. She is a wench who lied and stole
Repaid my love with treason. Broke my heart
And left me weakened for mine enemies
To ruin and to taunt. Tell me the rest,
Leave not a portion out. Describe her pain,
Her hunger, her remorse. I would know all.
PortiaThe font has failed to change thy cruel soul;
Thou art a Christian, Shylock, but in name.
ShylockWell, blame thy sacred water. Blame not me.
Gratiano And so poor Jessica must starve and die?
ShylockWhy, no. For you and she (pointing to Portia) should be her friends.
[98]You Christians will not let a Christian fall.
GratianoNow there we cut the venom from thy tongue
For Jessica will not accept our aid.
PortiaIndeed, old man, we know not where she is.
We told you, that you might go search for her.
Bassanio did offer her employment
But she refused, belike because her shame
Would not permit that we should see her shame.
And so she fled.
GratianoAnd may yet be alive.
Shylock These circumstances you should tell unto
Lorenzo. 'Twas he took her upon himself
For better or for worse. Fare you well.
I have affairs that interest me more.
GratianoCome, Lady Portia. 'Tis a waste of time.
The Bible says that God did choose the Jews
But says not what it was He chose them for.
Our ancient friend hath made it clear to me
That they were chosen by our gracious Lord
To be a kind of warning and example
Of what a misbeliever may become.
PortiaThou wilt not save thy daughter?
Shylock Lady fair,
In this peculiar and imperfect world
The virtues are divided into parts:
For instance, mercy. Some do practice it,
And some do merely preach. A third there are
Whose only contribution is to be
The text from which the second sermons preach;
They neither preach nor practice. Such am I.
Farewell.
GratianoWe but insult ourselves to stay. (Exit Portia and
Gratiano. Shylock looks after them. Enter Antonio, sees
Shylock, walks over to him and touches him with his stick.
Shylock turns.)
AntonioHebrew, have I found thee out at last?
Once more thy promises are broken, eh?
ShylockYes, yes. I pray you              
Antonio Pray me nothing more.
ShylockSignor Antonio, wait another day.
AntonioAnother day. For what? Until you hide
A bag of ducats or a jewel case?
Your bonds are by a fortnight overdue
And day by day your fortune dwindles down.
If I should sell the roof above your head
And all your land and chattels, they would bring
Less than enough to pay me what you owe.
[99]ShylockI prithee not so loud. But you alone
Are cognizant of my disastrous state.
My name is good. Perchance I may obtain
A temporary loan to tide me through.
But if my losses come to other ears
Before my kinsmen and my ship arrive
A bankrupt's ending stares me in the face.
Wait, wait Antonio, surely he will come,
My cousin Issachar who sailed away.
AntonioThy cousin Issachar will come no more.
He promised to return three weeks ago.
ShylockBut think, remember, good Antonio,
The vessel could not founder. 'Twas my best,
Held in reserve, the last one of my fleet.
Issachar swore he knew the very spot
Where dusky natives mined the laughing gold
And that if I would furnish men and ships
The moiety of the cargo would be mine.
Perhaps he is a little while delayed.
AntonioPerhaps another theory will fit.
Perhaps your kinsman filled the ship with gold
And then did point his helm another way.
Perhaps in England now he lives at ease
And deems the whole is better than a half.
Consider, sir, your kinsman is a Jew.
ShylockHe will not fail me, for he is my friend.
Patience, good sir, patience a day or two.
Deal with me kindly as so oft before
You treated many an unfortunate.
AntonioLet's have no whining. See you pay my bills
No later than to-day. Expect no further time.
I have done more than doth in truth become
A Christian to oblige a Jew withal.
Think not to share the leniency I give
To men of Venice of my faith and blood.
This case is different.
ShylockBut did thy Lord
Not preach a creed of brotherhood and love
And bid thee treat thy neighbor as thyself?
AntonioHe meant our Christian neighbors who reside
By right of law and ancient heritage
Within the land, but not the tribe who do
Usurp the places of their betters. No!
ShylockI am a Christian, made so by your Church.
Your own priest said so and it must be true.
Antonio'Twas but a form to bend thy haughty will.
In heart and manner thou art still a Jew.
[100]They should be glad that they can here remain
To practice sacrilege, and cheat, and fawn.
I marvel we can be so tolerant.
ShylockThe God who made this land and you and me
Mocks at your selfish, mean, philosophy.
When you or yours can build a mountain peak
Or add a grain unto the universe
Then talk of this fair ground as your domain.
The earth is one and rests within His hand;
The great and small His erring children are,
But we who from Yisrael claim descent
Are now the eldest of the family.
The God of Justice never slumbereth.
Jehovah is His name; His will be done.
AntonioMumble thy prayers if that affords relief,
But if by sundown I am not repaid
Another Moses must thou be and bring
Another set of miracles from heaven
Or lose the very coat from off thy back.
By sundown       but a few short minutes hence. (Exit Antonio)
ShylockFinished       almost finished       almost done.
I see the wave that soon above my hopes,
My fears, my sorrows, and my broken heart,
Will roll in cruel triumph. I'm content.
A long and troubled record I shall leave
Of struggles in the dark 'gainst many foes.
I begged for light to see my duty clear
To see the purpose of my suffering
To see the end that my Creator served
In heaping hills of torment on my head.
The light has never come. But now ere long
I must be called where all shall be made clear.
Till then a few weeks more of faith in Him
A few weeks more with an unfalt'ring tongue
To praise His wisdom though its end be hid.
A few weeks more to walk within His law.
(Starts to walk off. Enter Jessica in disordered dress and manner.)
JessicaFather!
Shylock Back! Away! Dare not to touch me.
JessicaA word, a single word and I will go.
Shylock(trying to wrest his arm from her grasp)
Let be I say.
JessicaNay, but I cannot leave.
I know not how much time I have to live.
I marvel that this body thin and frail
[101]Has so long stood th' innumerable shocks
Which in my married life it hath endured.
Death must be near, it stretcheth out its arms,
And I in answer have extended mine.
ShylockCome not to me for money. Had I all
The wealth of Sheba's mines I would not pay
A mite to save thy fallen soul from hell.
The potter's field may have thy rotten bones
And owls and jackals pray for thy repose.
Jessica'Tis not for gold I beg but for thy love.
I threw it from me like an orange sucked
And turned to grasp the shining fruit that he,
Lorenzo, pictured to mine eyes. Ah me,
How bitter, hard and worthless to the taste
Hath been that substitute. The marriage moon
Had scarce grown full before my body bore
The marks of coward blows.
ShylockHa! Ha! That's well.
JessicaI have not known a single kindly word,
I scarce have heard him call me by my name
Since less than four weeks after we were wed.
Shylock(gloatingly rubbing his hands) Hm!
JessicaOh father, why was I not told before
That we and all our people are accurst;
That those to whom we give our love and trust
Curse us and loathe us with a dreadful hate,
A hate that neither reason can assuage
Nor conduct make amends for. Awful fate,
That makes the very children of the street
With circle eyes point at us in contempt,
And people who have never heard our names
Thirst for our blood and menace us with death!
ShylockSo thou didst think a priestly comedy
Could make Lorenzo love his Jewish wife?
JessicaI could have died for him. For him I fled
And stole your wealth and helped your enemies.
Why could he not have been a little kind?
Shylock(chuckling) Come tell me how he beat you. Tell me that.
JessicaHave pity, father.
ShylockTell me how he swore.
JessicaOh, torture me no further. Take me back.
Love me not now, but let me win your love
A little at a time. No day shall pass
But in it I shall do some tiny act
That will in time make up a wealth of deeds,
And if we both are living long enough
The balance will be as it was before.
[102]ShylockThy pleadings are but wasted, Jessica,
Thou canst not gain the end that thou dost seek.
For even if I have the foolish will
(And I assure thee that I have it not)
To bring thee back to all the luxury,
The silken clothes, the soft and perfumed beds,
The shining jewels of thy girlhood days,
I could not. I am almost penniless.
JessicaPoor, and alone, and old! Nay, father dear,
Thou couldst not drive me from thee after this
Hadst thou the strength of ten. Let us go forth
And find a little corner of the earth
Where I may work and you may live at peace.
Shylock I need no aid. I want no help from thee.
JessicaThen give me thine. I starve for sympathy.
I shall go mad. I saw my baby die
And all around me were my husband's friends
Who spoke in terms of polished elegance.
With formal platitudes and commonplace
Regarding me as something curious,
A vulgar, noisy creature, lacking taste
And proper self-control. While on its bier
Lay all the joy that life in promise held.
Dead, and my heart within it.(Weeps)
      (Shylock turns to go, looks back after a step or two, and returns)
ShylockI did not know the little one was dead.
Was it a pretty child?
JessicaA pretty child!
A cherub could not be more beautiful.
Blue eyes and golden hair. A tiny mouth
A dimple in her chin. (Shylock puts his arm around Jessica)
ShylockThy mother's face belike. So did she look.
And how old when it       died?
JessicaA year, a year.
      (Enter Antonio and Gratiano. Antonio touches Shylock on the shoulder)
AntonioWell, let us have an end. The time is up.
I now demand the payment of my bonds.
ShylockI have not moved since last you spoke to me.
AntonioAll's one for that. You had no move to make.
Your whole estate is in the bailiff's hands
And you yourself may come along with me.
ShylockWhere would you take me?
AntonioWhy, before the Duke.
ShylockWhat need of trials? Freely I confess
The debts I owe you. Take what you can find.
[103]Take ev'ry rag and counter. Take them all.
Myself and Jessica must go away.
AntonioNot quite so fast. The law expressly states
That I may put you in the debtor's gaol
And so I mean to do.
Shylock But good Signor       
AntonioNo protest will avail. I know you Jews.
You hang together in calamity
And help each other while the Christians starve.
Let them redeem you and repay my loss.
ShylockGood sir, my kin are very far away
And poor as I.
Antonio 'Twill do no good to lie.
Write letters. I will see them promptly sent.
ShylockI swear to you Antonio       
Gratiano Wait a while.
First tell us if the oath thou art to make
Is sworn as Christian or in Hebrew style;
Though truly which to give the preference
Is matter to discuss. A Jewish oath
Thou canst not take for thou hast been baptised,
And sooth to say I have a sort of doubt
About thy reverence for Christian forms.
ShylockBy that great Power who can humble both
Hebrew and Christian, I do swear to you
That not in all this universe's span
Have I a claim on friends or relatives
As large as this. Much more have I the right
To claim assistance from Antonio
Who though he found me keen for my revenge
And steadfast in assertion of my rights
Can bring no accusation on my head
Of underhanded trickery or crime.
GratianoBecause we watch you pretty carefully.
ShylockWhat say you, sir? You will not keep us here?
AntonioI warned thee once cajoling will not serve.
Write out the letters. That's the only way.
I'll see that while you tarry in the gaol
Your comfort shall not be too much disturbed.
Your food shall be according to your wish
And other things in reason you may have.
JessicaGood sir, I think you know me, do you not?
AntonioWhy, are you not my friend Lorenzo's wife?
Jessica I am the Jessica who married him,
But not his wife if wifehood is a state
That presupposes more than legal rights.
I and Lorenzo are as strangers now
[104]And less than strangers, less than enemies.
AntonioI grieve to hear it.
Jessica I would have your grief
Not for myself but for my father here.
He speaks the truth. He has no more to give.
AntonioThen let him call upon his wealthy friends,
The other Jews will trust him if he asks.
JessicaYou heard him say he knows not where to sue.
AntonioO, that was but the cunning of his race.
JessicaUnfeeling man! If his deserts are dumb
What of your obligation due to me?
The Court's decree as you no doubt recall
Was that the half of his estate should go
To you to hold in trust for me and mine.
I charge you now upon your Christian faith
To give my father all the residue
That will be mine when he shall pass away
Or take it for yourself and let him go.
AntonioThree obstacles prevent your sacrifice.
The first is that though my intent was fair
By bad investments more than half the fund
Has disappeared, and all that doth remain
Would not suffice to satisfy the bonds.
The second, that the sum is payable
Upon your father's death, which is not yet.
But third and most of all the money goes
To you and to your husband, not to you.
The gift is joint and neither can alone
Claim all himself or any several part.
Indeed, I own it frankly, my desire
In asking that the Duke should so decree
Was not to benefit Lorenzo's wife,
A Jewess, who was never aught to me,
But solely to befriend Lorenzo's self
My coreligionist and distant kin.
To give you anything of Shylock's gold
Without Lorenzo's will would be a wrong,
A breach of trust, a patent injury.
And if your separation from his love,
As shrewdly I suspect, be fault of yours
And growing from thy Jewish wilfulness,
It would be most unfaithful and untrue
That I should thus reward inconstancy.
You see, in honor and before the law
I must refuse to do as you request.
JessicaI see that Jesus died in vain for you.
His Jewish heart, with pity for the low
[105]And meek and humble broke upon the cross
And for a time the magic of his words
Restrained the beast in Gentile followers,
But soon the kindly Stoic lost his sway
And cruel bigots in his Jewish name,
By his offenceless, mild authority
Took fire and sword and hatred for their flag.
Antonio My girl, there is a law 'gainst blasphemy.
GratianoWhy stand we here and listen to her spleen?
Away with Shylock. Take him to the gaol.
AntonioCome on.
Jessica No! No!
Shylock Resist no more, my child.
JessicaOh, father, we may never meet again;
Your age and suffering cannot endure
The shock of this disgrace.
Shylock 'Tis better so.
I pray for death. It cannot come too soon.
Farewell.
JessicaFarewell. (Throws her arms around him)
Yet not a long farewell,
I shall not far survive. It is no sin
To end a life of misery and shame.
Isaac (behind scenes) Where is my master? Where has Shylock gone? (Enter Isaac.)
GratianoHere fellow, here he is. With Jessica
He poses like a model for the arts.
Isaac Great news and wonderful. His ship is here
And laden full of gold. The mine is found
And Issachar and he are princely rich.
This cargo is the greatest that has come
To Venice since the city first began.
AntonioI do rejoice to hear it. Truly Jew
I have no wish to do thy body harm
But thou and thy relations are well known
To be so deep in craft and villainy
That to recover what is justly due
We Christians must resort to rigid means.
Go freely with thy daughter. Later on
When ev'rything's in order I'll return
And you may pay me what the balance is.
      (Exit Antonio and Gratiano, followed by Isaac. Shylock still
stands expressionless with Jessica's arms around him.)

Jewish Students in European Universities

By Harry Wolfson

(Concluded)


Judaism and Jewish Students in France

THE decadence of native Judaism in France has become proverbial. The
original French Jews never amounted to much; and the Alsatian
immigrants, while still supplying rabbis for the pulpits, have of late
begun to disappear from the pews. You may state it is an axiom that
the synagogue will have to go a-begging for a quorum wherever
church-going is unpopular. But French Judaism has recently been
gaining reinforcement by the influx of newcomers from Eastern Europe.
Paris might be considered next to London the greatest centre of Jewish
immigration in Europe. In fact, Paris as well as some large cities in
the Low Countries, and to some extent even London, have since the
beginning of the Jewish movement towards the United States, become the
refuge of a considerable number who straggled behind the migratory
columns and were unable to reach their final destination. Free from
any official molestations and rather welcomed by the native Jews, the
foreign Jewish community in Paris has flourished in its own way. It
numbers by this time about twenty-five thousand souls, a large
proportion of whom were born and brought up in the French capital.

It is these young French Jews of immigrant parentage, students and
professional men, who organized themselves, about two years ago, in an
"Association des Jeunes Juifs," known by its initials as A. J. J. The
aim of that organization, which is non-partisan in Jewish affairs, is
both cultural and practical. It publishes a monthly by the name of
"Les Pionniers," and occasionally holds debates and lectures on
various Jewish topics. It also carries on a program of social work
among the immigrant Jews. I might perhaps give a clearer idea of the
object of the A. J. J. by reproducing their following declaration:
"Notre But.       Nous voulons nous affirmer 'Juifs' sans forfanterie, mais
avec fermet        ; cultiver, d        velopper parmis nous, faire conna       tre au
dehors, l'       me juive; nous         duquer mutuellement; demander, par les
voies l        gales, le respect, la justice pour tous,       fussent-ils juifs;
aider nos fr        res         migr        s          l'aqu        rir la qualit         de citoyen; inculquer
         nos membres les principes de solidarit         et de mutualit        ." In the
summer of 1913, Dr. Nahum Slouszch of the Sorbonne submitted to the
society a scheme for more extensive activities, both Jewish[107] and
patriotic in their scope, namely, the participation in educational and
social work among the indigenous Jews of the French possessions in
Africa.


The Jew of the Roman Ghetto

IT is a pity that so little is known to us about the life of the
Jewish masses in Italy. The fame of the Nathans and Luzzattis has led
us to believe that in Italy Jews form the class of society from which
mayors and statesmen are recruited. But in Italy the majority of Jews
still live in social and economic conditions not far advanced above
those of their ancestors in centuries past. Italy is the only country
in Europe outside those in the Eastern part where the so-called
ghettoes are populated by native Jews. Their political emancipation
has not raised them from the bottom of the social structure over the
heads of their Gentile neighbors. Nowhere is the average Jew so much
like the non-Jew in appearance, language, manners, and vocation than
the inhabitant of the Roman Ghetto on the bank of the Tiber. He is
engaged there in the petty trades of selling his olives, peaches, and
figs, and hires out as a journeyman in and outside his country. He
hawks with "cartiloni" and "ricordi di Roma" in front of the caf        
terraces, and his street waifs accost the foreigners for a "soldi."
Even at the door of his old-clothes shop you can hardly recognize in
him the Jew. It is this, more than the paucity of the number of Jews
in Italy, that explains the absence of anti-Jewish feeling there. For
the name Sacerdote by which Italian Cohens call themselves does not
suggest affluence, and the cognomen Levi does not necessarily
designate one's business.

In his religious life the Jew of the Roman Ghetto resembles the
Lithuanian rather than the Western European. His religious activity,
to be sure, is restricted to the prayer services of the Temple, but
his Temple is more like a Beth Midrash than a symphony hall and
lyceum. Living within a Catholic environment, his religion has been
preserved as something positive, tangible, and powerful; and if it is
no longer an inspiring influence within him, it exists at least as a
reality outside of him. The religious institutions and
instrumentalities are looked upon by him as something hallowed and
consecrate. The synagogue is spoken of as the "sacro tempio" and the
rabbi, referred to by the Hebrew words "Morenu Harav," is looked up to
in matters religious as if he were the incumbent of the throne of
Moses. The place of worship is opened three times a day for the
traditional number of the daily public prayers, and young men as well
as old, unwashed and in their working garments, repair there directly
from their work to hear the "sacra messa," as the services are
sometimes termed by them. Most of the younger Jews are unable to read
the Hebrew prayers, some read without understanding them; but they all
know a few selected prayers by heart which they recite aloud with many
interesting gesticulations[108] and genuflections, while in the pulpit the
Chasan reads the services from a prayer-book printed in Livorno,
chanting them in a monotonous sing-song not unlike what one often
hears in the chapels of St. Peter.


Societies of Jewish Youth in Italy

RACIAL consciousness is strong among these Jews of the Roman Ghetto.
They are to themselves, in common parlance, "Ibrim" or "Yahudim,"
which they utter not without pride, and the Gentile is looked down
upon as a mere "goi," while the passing priest is pointed out as a
"komer." If you ever happen to be in Rome, I should advise you take
one afternoon off, and ordering a "caf         noro" at some caf         house on
the Piazza Venezia, sit down quietly at a table on the terrace and try
to look Jewish. You will soon be assailed by a number of postal-card
venders coming one after another, until one importunate youth,
discovering your identity, will of a sudden change his attitude, and,
his obsequiousness gone, will enter with you into an intimate
conversation. He will tell you his name, his pedigree, and of the
"tempio," and of the street where many Jews live. He will no longer
entreat you to buy his goods; and if you do so, he will mumble out his
"grazie" rather perfunctorily. For are not all Israel of the same
descent?       and if they are not all princes, at least none of them is
better than a postal-card vender in Rome.

It is therefore not surprising that among the native Italian Jews
there should arise on the part of the young educated elements a desire
to convert that latent Jewish sentiment into some form of practical
and useful activity. A society of Jewish youth in Italy has already
existed for about three years during which time two conventions were
held. A number of commendable resolutions were passed about the
improvement of Jewish education among the Italian Jews and especially
the advancement of the study of the Hebrew language among them.
Zionism was warmly endorsed, though the society as a whole did not
commit itself officially to the cause. Like the A. J. J. of Paris, the
Italian organization also purports to act as intermediaries between
the Italian government and the native Jewish population of Tripoli. In
Rome there is a local organization of Jewish students, devoted to the
study of Hebrew literature, and is rather of cosmopolitan complexion,
being composed of Italian, Greek, German, and Russian Jews. The moving
spirit of that circle was a brilliant Russian Jew, who had graduated
in law from the University of Rome.


Conclusion: The Growing National Spirit Among Jewish Students

A CLOSE observation of European Jewish students, both as individuals
and as groups, leads one to the realization of a growing consciousness
among them of national unity, and of an increasing belief on their
part of[109] the imperishability of the Jews as a race. That morbid
feeling of national decay and the imminent disappearance of the race,
which had preyed upon the minds of Jewish men in the past generation,
and which is reflected in the literature of that time, has been
everywhere displaced by one of confidence and hope. Desertion from
Judaism, to be sure, may sporadically make its appearance here and
there as a convenient escape from material disadvantages; indifference
towards it may likewise in some quarters still survive as a relic of
the past,       but these are rather unusual and isolated phenomena,
emphasizing all the more the universal fidelity and attachment to all
things Jewish.

The enthusiasm for Judaism, everywhere in a process of growth,
manifests itself in its early stages in study and self-cultivation; it
assumes a more concrete form, in its later stages, of some communal or
social activity; and if that development keeps on uninterruptedly it
finally consummates in Zionism. This development, it must be admitted,
is not a spontaneous and self-directive movement. In no small measure,
it is everywhere stimulated by the growing tendency on the part of
non-Jews in almost every country to appraise the Jew according to his
racial origin, an appraisal which results in a feeling not necessarily
hostile, but in most cases neutral and sometimes even favoring the
racial and cultural peculiarity, indestructible and impermiscible, of
the Jewish element. It is this external stimulus, rather than any
internal impulse, that is responsible for the unfolding of the
national spirit among Jewish students and the assertion of their
selfhood.

None the less, their self-assertion has nowhere reached the extreme of
spiritual alienation from their environment. There is nothing more
remarkable in the character of Jewish youth of the present day, even
among those who were born and raised in East European ghettos, than
the spiritual and intellectual snugness in which they find themselves,
in what should have been expected to remain to them a foreign
environment. The residual estrangement of the Jewish soul from
everything that is non-Jewish, which our forefathers in the past had
figuratively designated with what Jewish mysticism called the
"Captivity of the Shekinah," has totally disappeared. The individual
Jew of to-day, while sharing in the sublimated consciousness of the
race as a whole, does not in any conscious or subliminal way feel
himself to be personally identified with it; whence the hesitation on
the part of the majority of Jewish students to participate actively in
Zionism even though they would all admit it to be the logical sequel
of Jewish history.

For Zionism to them can never become a personal ideal, something
requisite for the salvation of their souls. It can at its best appeal
to them, in so far as they are consciously Jewish, as the cause of the
nation as a whole; and consequently the mere suspicion that their
affiliation with[110] the movement might be held up against them as an
impugnment of their loyalty to the land of their birth and abode is
sufficient to keep them aloof from it. It was very interesting for me
to notice how everywhere, after a long man      uvre of Zionist discussions
with good Jewish young men, they would finally halt at their
unshakable position that Zionists might arouse the suspicion of their
Gentile neighbors as to the loyalty and patriotism of the Jews. Where
people are obsessed by the fear of being misunderstood in doing what
they otherwise think to be good and impeccable, no arguments, of
course, can avail. They are in this respect characteristically Jewish.
In their Brand-like racial frame of mind, the Jews could never stop
midway between the two antipodes of roving world-citizenry and
hidebound mono-patriotism. It is probable that their attitude will
change as soon as it is generally realized that personal devotion and
loyalty to two causes are not psychologically a self-deception, and
that the serving of two masters is not a moral anomaly unless, as in
the original adage, one of the masters be Satanic.







Extract from a letter received from William Chadwick,
President of the Hebrew Congregation and the Adler
Society, Oxford University, England, commenting on the
section devoted to England in Mr. Wolfson's article in
our January number: "The remarks of Mr. Wolfson, whom
we remember very well, concerning Oxford, were very
apt for the time; but in Oxford, one particular type
of Judaism never remains for long; Judaism here is in
a state of perpetual flux, and to seize upon any one
moment and represent that view as a type of Oxford's
Judaism is very erroneous. I am sure that if Mr.
Wolfson were here now, he would not recognize the
services or the attitude now prevalent. I doubt if he
would now hear Liberal Judaism apostrophised 'as the
safeguard of modern Jews from the attractiveness of
the superior teachings of Christ.'" [111]




Zionism: A Menorah Prize Essay

By Marvin M. Lowenthal




MARVIN M. LOWENTHAL (born in Bradford, Pa., in 1890)
is at present a Senior in the University of Wisconsin. He has won the
Wisconsin Menorah Society Prize twice       in 1912 for an essay on "The
Jew in the American Revolution," and in 1914 for the essay on
"Zionism" here published for the first time. Mr. Lowenthal is now the
President of the Wisconsin Zionist Society.

AT the head of an alley-way hard by the Place of the Temple, the
Haram-esh-Sherif, in Jerusalem, a long wall built in rough-hewn
courses lifts itself above the squalor of the Moghrebin quarter to an
eastern sky from which a sun that seldom sleeps bakes the grey stones,
bares every detail of a crumbling ruin, and intensifies the wistful
odor of decay. This, the remnant of Solomon's glory, is the Wailing
Wall of the Jews. Clad in sackcloth and covered with ashes,
patriarchal figures sway to and fro, press their lips to the hot
granite, beat now their chests and now the wall, and today, as every
day for eighteen hundreds of years, wail in the words of the Psalmist:



"Oh God, the heathen are come into Thine inheritance;
Thy holy Temple have they defiled;
They have laid Jerusalem in heaps."[1]


This picture reveals the typical and traditional attitude of the Jew
toward the land of his forefathers. Taught as children in the Cheder
to turn their thoughts and desires toward Palestine; devoting
themselves as men to the study of the Law and the Prophets and to the
building upon this study of the vast Talmudic structure, until a
spiritual Land of the Book may be said to have been created wherein
they continually dwelt; crystallizing and adopting the Restoration as
a dogma of the faith; commemorating with solemn fasts the Ninth of Ab
as the anniversary of the destruction of the Temple by Titus; and
repeating at each Passover with the pitiful hope of a child, "Next
year in Jerusalem," the Jews have bound the memory of Palestine as a
sign upon their hands and as frontlets between their eyes. They have
indeed written it upon the door-posts of their houses and upon their
gates, to the end       that they have wept and prayed. The vision of the
prophets, which created and sustained this passionate ideal, itself
inhibited the realization by emphasizing the redemption[112] as
miraculous, as a consummation to come in its own time without man's
effort, and indeed in spite of man's will. And so, except for the
sporadic and meteoric fiascos of mock-Messiahs, the Jews       this most
practical of people       continued in hope and prayer to watch the
centuries creep by. Frequently the hope flowered into the songs of a
Judah Halevi or Ibn Gabirol, songs as sweet as have blossomed in the
medieval garden; and the prayer found expression in a poignancy
attributable only to the racial genius which created the Psalms; but
until the nineteenth century the dream preserved all the qualities of
a dream.


A Crusade for A Birthright

ON August 29, 1897, a congress convened in Basel, Switzerland,
comparable in Jewry to the Council of Clermont; for in this congress
two hundred and four Jews, acting as delegates of their people from
half the countries in the world, assembled at the call of Theodor
Herzl to go crusading for the recovery of Palestine. This difference,
among others, may be apparent       the Christians sought the recovery of a
grave; the Jews, of a cradle. Palestine was to be a cradle in two
senses; this Congress, the first body representative of all Jewry to
be convened in the Diaspora, claimed the land of Israel not by virtue
of a death, but as a birthright, and furthermore hoped to find its
recovery the opportunity for the rejuvenation of a people.

Quoting from his book, "The Jewish State"[2]       a book journalistic in
style, but trumpet-toned in the note it sounded for political
Zionism       Theodor Herzl offered the following definition of Zionism
after the first Zionist Congress (1897): "Zionism has for its object
the creation of a home, secured by public rights, for those Jews who
either cannot or will not be assimilated in the country of their
adoption."[3] Zionism, in a word, is not the last truism in a weary
debate, nor a new verse to an old song; it is, on the contrary, a
definite answer to a perplexing and imperative question. What are
these Jews who cannot or will not be assimilated, and why cannot or
will not they be assimilated? This question constitutes what is known
as the Jewish problem, or, for those who deny or dislike the term,
the Jewish position; and this question must first be fully stated
before the Zionist or any other answer can be intelligible.


The Isolation of Medieval Jewry

THE Jews in the Middle Ages were considered by themselves, their few
friends, and their many enemies, as a twice separated nation       a people
separated from those among whom they dwelt and separated from[113] the
land in which they originated. They were governed by their own
law       the Lex Jud       orum       which was recognized by the authorities of the
land in which they lived as peculiar and proper to them;[4] they dwelt
in communal groups which were bound together by common interests; they
observed their own customs and nourished their own culture; they were
held to be foreigners, and in a comparison of their own with the
Christian civilization, they readily acknowledged this status. The
force of persecution without and the religious conviction of
superiority, separateness, and nationality within, preserved and
constantly increased this solidarity.[5]

That the existence of a separate, recalcitrant, and even obnoxious
nation within a nation did not constitute a problem for the medievals
may be attributable to two reasons: (1) the medieval theory of life
accentuated a hierarchical order of existence       a theory that found
expression in feudalism, in Church organization, and in guild and
craft life; in pursuance of this theory, the Jews were accorded a
recognized and distinct status; (2) furthermore, the Jews were an
economic necessity in the times when a ban was laid on money-lending,
and they constituted an important economic facility at a little later
period when capital could indeed be worked but when rivalry and
hatreds rendered communication uncertain.[6] To the maintenance of
Jewish solidarity and the preservation of things Jewish qua Jewish,
sacrifices culminating in the surrender of life bequeathed to the race
a comprehensive martyrology.[7]

Ernest Renan defines a nation as "a great solidarity constituted by
the sentiment of the sacrifices that its citizens have made and those
they feel prepared to make once more. It implies a past, but is summed
up in the present by a tangible fact       the clearly expressed desire to
live a common life." In sum, the Jews throughout the Middle Ages,
which was prolonged for them until a little less than two hundred
years ago, comprised a nation as virtual in point of their own claim
and its recognition by other nations as in the days when they were
established in Palestine. Renaissance, Reformation, and the
rediscovery of the world by science failed to make an impression on
the thick ghetto walls; and Jewish isolation, even as late as the
eighteenth century, may be vividly realized by thinking of Rousseau
and Voltaire in contrast with the contemporary lights of Jewry       Elijah
Gaon and Israel Besht,[8] men as medieval as a gargoyle.

The French Revolution with its early philosophy of naturalism and
humanism and its later political expression in liberty, equality, and
fraternity, razed the physical and spiritual walls of the ghetto and
set up[114] the "Jewish problem." Following the Revolution, four currents
of thought and action, working both simultaneously and successively,
causing, reacting upon, and intermingling with one another, affecting
the Jews now favorably and now unfavorably, went into the making of
this problem. To deal with Emancipation, Enlightenment, Nationalism,
and Anti-Semitism in detail would consume a volume, but an outline of
their bearing on the present situation is essential.


Emancipation and Enlightenment

EMANCIPATION may be defined as the removal of the civil disabilities
from the Jews, following the acceptance of liberal principles by the
European governments. The process was a gradual one. In 1791 the
French Assembly passed the vote for the complete emancipation of the
Jews, which procedure was ratified and firmly established by the
Napoleonic regime. Belgium (1830), England (1846), Sweden (1848),
Denmark and Greece (1849), Prussia (1850), Austria (1867), Spain
(1868), Italy (1870), and Switzerland (1874) followed the lead of
France. The Balkan States in the treaty of Berlin (1878), upon
pressure from Disraeli, agreed to the emancipation of the Jews as one
of the conditions for securing their own freedom; Roumania has been
notoriously delinquent, however, in adhering to the terms nominated in
the bond.[9] The removal of civil disabilities brought the Jew into a
wide contact with the Christian. This resulted for the Jews in
liberalization of outlook and liberation of capacities and talents, in
an abandonment of the "jargon" for the national tongues, in a
precipitation into the Haskalah movement (to be described in the next
paragraph), and in a restatement of their leading religious doctrines,
which amounted to a surrender in theory of their nationality and their
destiny as a Chosen People to be restored to Palestine. For the
Christians the removal of Jewish disabilities resulted in the
necessity of either accepting or rejecting the Jew's claim to be an
equal and a fellow-countryman.

The Enlightenment, or Haskalah movement, broadly speaking, comprises
the Jewish absorption of secular learning, particularly in literature
and science, the abandonment of the study of the Talmud for modern
subjects, and the adoption of farm and craft life.[10] Moses
Mendelssohn in Germany and Lilienthal in Russia were the first great
protagonists of these radical departures; and the movement, which in
part led to the demand for Emancipation and in part resulted from it,
further removed the differences between Jew and non-Jew, at least from
the standpoint of the former, and further removed him from his
religious and historical[115] past, perceptibly weakening and in many
cases practically destroying the medieval sense of solidarity. Each
Jew adopted the culture of his native country, and so one Jew became
virtually a foreigner to another. Haskalah, in a word, is a looking
outward on the part of the Jew; for all its virtues this movement had
the consequence of blunting racial consciousness and blurring racial
identity.


Nationalism and Anti-Semitism

ALL might have been well but for the presence of a third and
conflicting element. While the Jew became infected with the
universalism of the Revolutionary spirit, the majority of Europeans
were absorbing and developing the particularistic implications of '89.
Nationalism is the self-consciousness of a people, and it found its
European expression in the creation of the modern States of Germany,
Italy, Hungary, Greece, and the small Balkans. It is a race's
recognition of itself, a looking inward, and it leads to the pursuit
of racial ideals and development of racial qualities       an inward
expansion which, indifferent to the charge of chauvinism, can only be
secured by an outward discrimination. The Jew and the Christian had
changed places since medieval times: the Jew now stood for a universal
society and a universal church, and the Christian for exclusion and
separation upon racial bases. Emancipation thus brought the conflict
directly to the attention of the strong majority, namely, the
Christians, and anti-Semitism was their answer.

In its restricted sense, anti-Semitism is a scientific stick used to
beat the Jewish dog with. After impartial, impersonal scientific
investigation, French and German scholars[11] demonstrated the racial
inferiority of the Semite to the Aryan, enumerated the inherent
Semitic qualities as greed, special aptitude for money-making,
aversion to hard work, clannishness, obstrusiveness, lack of social
tact and of patriotism, the tendency to exploit and not to be overly
honest. Ernest Renan adequately sums up the anti-Semite position when
he claims for the Aryans all the great military, political, and
intellectual movements of history.[12] The Semites never had a
comprehension of civilization in the sense in which the Aryan
understands the word; they were at no time public-spirited.[13] In
fact, intolerance was the natural consequence of Semitic
monotheism.[14]

In the wider sense,[15] anti-Semitism is the modern word for the old
and apparently ineradicable hatred of the Jew, partly dependent, as G.
F.[116] Abbott well shows,[16] not only upon Christian faith, but upon the
Christian frame of mind and feeling       a hatred to which the Nationalism
of the nineteenth century furnished a reasonable fuel, which found a
social expression in ostracism and rioting[17] and a political
expression in the formation of the Christian Socialist Party in
Germany (1878), and similar parties in Austria and Hungary (1882-99),
seeking the suppression of equal rights for Jews, the Dreyfus affair
in France (1895), and the open, violent persecutions in Roumania       all
aimed at annulling the privileges granted by the Emancipation.
Clerical, economic, and social opposition to the Jews combined to
support the nationalistic contention summed up in the words of
Heinrich von Treitschke (Professor of History, University of Berlin):
"Die Juden sind unser Ungl      ck."[18] This essay is not concerned with
the truth of the contention; suffice that it is advanced, supported,
and acted upon.


The Jewish Situation in the Four Zones

A REVIEW of the Jewish situation is now possible. But before
presenting this review, a definition of two words which will be
frequently used may not be irrelevant. The Jewish problem is taken
to mean an immediate concrete maladjustment where life and property
are imperiled, much as we speak of the Mexican problem. The Jewish
position, on the other hand, is taken to mean a social, cultural, or
spiritual disharmony or repression, much as we speak of the position
of the Poles in Galicia and Russia.

The Jewish situation falls naturally into four geographical zones. The
first, which contains the problem in its most serious aspect, is
Eastern Europe, including Russia, Poland, and Roumania, where are
settled six of the twelve million Jews of the world.[19] In this zone,
the Jews are for the most part maintaining medieval solidarity and
separation, are suffering from medieval repression and persecution;
but on the other hand, (and this appears to be the determining factor
in the gravity of the problem), the Russian Jew is by no means a
necessity to the Russian in any way similar to that in which the
medieval Jew was a necessity to the medieval Christian. The eastern
Jew is beginning to expand with the leaven of the Haskalah, and is
simultaneously strangling for lack of the release and exercise of his
powers afforded by Emancipation. The Russian and Roumanian, in what
they believe to be the preservation of Nationalism, are determined on
crippling or destroying the inimical and[117] unassimilative factor in
their population; and although the Russian is politically medieval, he
is economically modern and considers himself restrained by no need of
Jewish money.[20] The outcome for the Jews is economic impoverishment,
social persecution, political enslavement, and spiritual
degeneration.[21]

The second zone includes Austria, Germany, and to a minor degree
France, where are settled approximately three millions of Jews. Save
in Galicia, where political and racial turmoil is constantly giving
the Jewish situation the sombre tinge of a problem, the Jews are
finding themselves, for the most part, in a precarious position.
Nationalism demands that they surrender their racial identity and
proclivities; anti-Semitism declares upon the verdict of science that
such surrender is impossible, and substitutes repression,
assimilation, or extinction. The Jews in attempting to satisfy the
conditions by entering fully into all the activities of national life
arouse through their success only greater hostility; and the situation
becomes converted into a vicious circle.

France to a large degree and England comprise the third zone, where
the Jewish position is identical with that of the fourth zone, the
United States, save in one important detail. The Jews in these two
zones, numbering only one-and-a-half million, have entered freely into
the national life about them, and, except for minor social
disabilities which can only make the judicious smile, have been
accorded equality, with the result that the Jew qua Jew is exposed
to complete assimilation. The distinction between the third and fourth
zone is that in England and France, anti-Semitism based on Nationalism
is a potentiality (though the recent Aliens Bill and Chesterton trial
would suggest that it might be more than this), whereas the open-door
theory of settlement which created the United States militates
basically against race-discrimination. The Jew of England and America
does not face persecution nor repression, but a gradual and apparently
pleasant extinction.

The medieval Jew found himself a necessary, well-paying, if not
honored, guest in the households of Europe; but the day when the Jew
resolved on adopting the life and manners of his host, the host
resolved on drawing tightly the family lines. The modern Jew has
discovered it necessary either to convince the obdurate host, who
points to a scientifically certified chart of the family-tree, that he
too is of blood germane, or take himself to lodgings in the cellarage.
And yet       a third possibility here insinuates itself       why may not the
Jew set up housekeeping for himself?

[118]

The Vain Effort of Reform Judaism

THE medieval Jew would have accepted without hope the unfortunate
predicament; the modern Jew, nerved with a distillation of the
Revolutionary "rights of men" and confident that he was not combating
the implacability of a religious hatred, adopted expedient and
remedial measures, the chief of which, since they form the opposition
to Zionism, will be outlined.

To justify Emancipation before and after it was secured, assimilative
doctrines of a peculiar type, known as Reform Judaism,[22] whereby the
essentials of Jewish life were to be separated and saved, constituted
the main attempt of the Jew to demonstrate that he was a member of the
households of Europe and not an intruder. Reform Judaism began as a
result of the Haskalah by simplifying and beautifying, according to
European standards, the Orthodox religious service (Germany 1810-20),
and ended by abandoning the Messianic Restoration, the doctrine that
Israel is in exile and that the prophecies are literally to be
fulfilled. The expediency of these measures is apparent. To refute the
anti-Semitic charge of racial inferiority, the existence of the race
as a separate entity was denied, and the necessary scientific backing
has lately been secured.[23] To meet the Nationalists, Israel's
national hopes were declared void, and it was strongly urged that the
basis of a modern nation is citizenship and not race.

The Reformers proceeded further and maintained that the Jewish people
were themselves the Messiah, whose mission was "to spread by its
fortitude and loyalty the monotheistic truth all over the earth, and
to be an example of rectitude to all others,"[24] whose goal was "not
a national Messianic State, but the realization in society of the
principles of righteousness as enunciated by the prophets;"[25]
wherefore, it was not only just that they receive citizenship, but
religious duty compelled the Jew to demand it.

The Jewish religion was considered the essential possession of the
Jewish people       so essential that it was to be maintained at the
sacrifice of assimilation; but nowhere is it made apparent how a
religion can be maintained without a people, how a people can be
maintained without separation, and how separation can be maintained
without abandoning the no-race, no-nation propositions. If these are
abandoned, the Jews are precisely where they began       another circle
whose viciousness is becoming obvious and is resulting in the constant
discarding of Jewish rite and form, until the religion which was to be
prized and saved is fast becoming a watery[119] Unitarianism, and its
adherents are allowing themselves, where permitted, to become
completely assimilated. Reform Judaism which began as a compromise is
ending as a surrender. The final and unanswerable objection to Reform
Judaism as a solution is that the majority of Jews will not even in
theory accept it. The devotion to race, religion, and separation is
too strong. The Gentile in asking the Jew to assimilate is undoubtedly
right; the refusal of the Jew undoubtedly is not wrong; and the ring
of true tragedy becomes audible.


The Palliative Measures of Philanthropy

CONTEMPORARY with the unsuccessful attempt at clearing up the Jewish
position in western Europe, palliative measures were undertaken to
solve the problem in eastern Europe. In 1860 the Alliance Israelite
Universelle was founded at Paris with the following purposes in
chief:[26]

1. To work everywhere for the emancipation and moral
progress of the Jew.

2. To give effectual support to those who are
suffering persecution because they are Jews. 

The Alliance began by distributing pamphlets and calling the attention
of western governments to eastern injustice; it gradually, however,
undertook practical work. Influenced by Rabbi Kalischer, religious
enthusiast, a farm school (Mikveh Israel) was established at Jaffa;
and after the Russian persecutions of 1880-82, active colonization for
the relief of refugees became the chief work, in which the Alliance
received substantial aid from Baron de Rothschild. Meanwhile Baron de
Hirsch, another philanthropist of international proportions, dedicated
millions to the foundation of colonies in Argentine and Palestine. In
the latter place the Hirsch activities were incorporated under the
title of the Jewish Colonization Association ("IKA", 1891), working in
harmony of aim with the Alliance and with still a third movement       one
more of the people       styled Chovevei-Zion (Lovers of Zion). The only
activities of the Chovevei-Zion, a general term attached to small and
ardent semi-affiliated societies throughout Europe and America, with
which we are here concerned are the philanthropic; and their services
in this respect were haphazard and negligible.[27]

To cast up briefly the sum of practical work accomplished by 1898: 94
schools in Asia and Africa,[28] and 25 colonies in Palestine
supporting[120] 5,000 Jews.[29] Such philanthropy is to be considered an
attempt, however valiant and noble, to empty the sea with a pail       with
a leaking pail.

Thus, upon a review of the situation, three alternatives present
themselves: (1) Maintenance of the status quo with its dull round of
persecution and degradation on one hand, and the soul-destroying life
in the Fool's Paradise of Reform Judaism on the other; (2)
Amalgamation with the surrounding peoples       a grim race-suicide; (3)
Re-establishment of a national center where, perhaps not the entire
people, but a remnant can be saved.


(To be concluded)



AS Greece stands for art and Rome stands for law and
order, so Judaea stands for morality, and so it
occupies an exalted position in history. The Menorah
Society comes to the University with a challenge and
defies us to ignore at our peril that which Judaism
has contributed to civilization and which we have
derived from it. We have derived our own religion from
it, and that spirit of Puritanism which was so closely
connected with the settlement of the new
world.       From an Address before the Cornell Menorah
Society by President Jacob Gould Schurman of Cornell

The Third Annual Convention of the Menorah Societies


I. The Public Meeting

THE Third Annual Convention of the Intercollegiate Menorah
Association was held at the University of Cincinnati, in the city of
Cincinnati, on Wednesday and Thursday, December 23 and 24, 1914. The
third session, on Wednesday evening, was a public meeting in the
University auditorium. Abraham J. Feldman, President of the University
of Cincinnati Menorah Society, formally welcomed the convention, and
introduced Chancellor Henry Hurwitz as the Chairman of the evening.
Mayor F. S. Spiegel brought the greetings and welcome of the city of
Cincinnati. Dean Joseph E. Harry extended a welcome in behalf of the
University, and Dr. Kaufman Kohler, President of Hebrew Union College,
welcomed the convention in behalf of his institution and of the Jewish
community. Professor I. Leo Sharfman of the University of Michigan,
President of the Intercollegiate Menorah Association, spoke on "The
Menorah Movement," and Dr. H. M. Kallen of the University of Wisconsin
delivered an address on "The Jews and the War." For the substance of
Dr. Kallen's address see his article on page 79. The other speakers
spoke in part as follows:


Dean J. E. Harry

IN behalf of the University of Cincinnati, I bid you welcome. I
confess that I can agree with the statement made in your declaration
of the nature and purpose of the Menorah Societies, that modern
civilization is chiefly a product of three ancient cultures, or to be
more exact, I should prefer to say two, since the Roman is but a
continuation of the Greek, and we cannot understand ourselves without
understanding and having direct reference to the character and work of
both the Greek and the Hebrew minds.

Two principal elements have entered into the spiritual life of the
modern world. The past and the present are one and inseparable, and
you cannot destroy the former without doing positive damage to the
latter. The roots of our civilization lie in the soil of antiquity,
and you cannot destroy and disentangle the fibers of the growing tree
of civilization from the far-off centuries that are gone, without
injuring the whole organism. "If we were to wipe out all the records
of the past, what a series of inexplicable riddles would our own
history present, and if we were to blot out entirely every reference
to ancient writers, or were to blow away all the perfume that has been
shaken down from the vestments of those writers, how blurred and how
scentless would the fairest and most fragrant pages of our own great
poets and historians appear!"

What we need to-day, what our country needs more than anything else,
is thorough, really liberally educated men, and not merely men who are
supposed by the general public to be educated, simply because they
have passed through a college, because in some quarters the business
of education has, alas, fallen into the hands of men who are not
themselves liberally educated; and so as an ardent advocate of the
humanities, with hope that the Intercollegiate Menorah Association
will contribute to the laying of greater stress upon the value of the
study of the humanities in our college curriculum,[122] I bid you
God-speed, and again extend to you the cordial greetings of the
University of Cincinnati.


Dr. Kaufman Kohler

I DO not know whether you have observed that Cincinnati is somewhat
akin to the city of Rome as well as to the holy city of Jerusalem       it
is a city with many hills. On this hill here, facing one another for
friendly and harmonious co      peration, the two institutions of learning
in which we especially, the Jewish community, take particular
pride       the University of Cincinnati, which so prominently and in ever
expanding proportion stands for the humanities, for classical culture,
for the professional and scientific branches of secular knowledge, and
on the other hand, the Hebrew Union College, which stands for the
mother religion of civilized humanity and for the progressive spirit
of Judaism and of Americanism. In this rather insignificant incident
the Jewish community may well find a great principle expressed. With
his face towards the East from which issues the light of day, where
was cradled the faith of Israel, the Jew, ever beholding in classical
wisdom and knowledge the sister of his faith, proceeded with the
westward march of civilization in order to make religion, by the
reason and research of the ages, a great, progressive power, ever
regenerating his spiritual heritage and rejuvenating that religion of
his own as it goes on through the centuries.

This fact, however, of a continual intellectual and spiritual progress
of Judaism, is altogether too rarely recognized by the surrounding
Christian world, even by its men of light and leading or by its seats
of learning, because the New Testament is looked upon by altogether
too many as the death warrant of the Old Testament, as if the sun of
civilization had stood still over Israel ever since its seers and
singers and sages of yore voiced the Divine message. Nor does the
Jewish man of culture and college training as a rule appreciate the
wondrous achievements of the Jewish genius since the very dawn of
history until our day, in the whole domain of learning and science, or
of ethical and religious culture.

It is therefore a highly laudable endeavor undertaken by the
Intercollegiate Menorah Association to arouse the dormant spirit of
self-respect in the academic Jewish youth, to stir in him the ambition
to study and know this matchless history and literature, and to kindle
in his soul anew that idealism which made the Jew throughout all the
ages endure and brave the onslaughts of the empires and churches and
the persecuting mobs, so that even to-day he is as young and as
vigorous as any of the youngest races and nations in the world.


The Importance of Israel's Religion

THIS past, I say, cannot but appeal to every high-minded American,
whether Christian or Jew, and your study of it will certainly meet
with our warmest support and encouragement. Only, in my opinion, one
thing you need, young as your association is, young in years and young
in experience, and that is, a full comprehension and keen realization
of the subject you have in view and a wise and right direction towards
it. No one doubts or questions the sincerity of your motives or the
praiseworthiness of your aims and purposes when you place on your
program the study of Jewish history, culture and problems, and the
advancement of Jewish ideals, but you omit that which is most
essential, which is the all-encompassing force and factor of Jewish
life, the real, peculiar and genuine product of the Jewish
genius       religion. We have got a religion which, as has been put by
Matthew Arnold, has fashioned four-fifths of the world's civilization.
In omitting the idea, as expressed by Matthew Arnold, of the power
that maketh for righteousness, in declaring your movement as being
altogether non-religious, you run the risk of making of your endeavor
an inevitable and certain failure.[G] Let me quote to you from an
address delivered recently before a Jewish society[123] in London on
"Israel and Medicine" by Professor Osler, sentences that are
remarkable and worth repeating. He says:

"In estimating the position of Israel in the human values, one must
remember that the quest for righteousness is Oriental, the quest for
knowledge, Occidental. With the great prophets of the East       Moses,
Isaiah, Mahomet [he might have included Jesus of Nazareth], the word
was 'Thus saith the Lord.' With the seers of the West, from Aristotle
to Darwin, it was 'What says nature?' Modern civilization is the
outcome of the two great movements of the mind of man, who is to-day
ruled in heart and head by Israel and by Greece. From the one he has
learned responsibility to a Supreme Being and love for his neighbor,
in which are embraced the law and the prophets. From the other he has
gathered the promise of Eden, to have dominion over the earth in which
he lives."

Now let me add to this that whatever the Jew claims or possesses of
culture he has borrowed from the nations and civilizations around him,
whether it be architecture, the art or the mode of writing, philosophy
and science, the modes of social and industrial life, all of which he
has taken and assimilated into his own life.

Not so with his religious truth. This is all his own, his peculiar and
genuine contribution to humanity. Thereby he has given human life its
eternal value, its purpose, its goal and hope for all time.

Now it seems to me that you may as well expect of the blind to depict
for you his impressions of the prismatic glories of the rainbow, or of
the deaf to orate on the beauties of a Beethoven symphony, as to
expect of one who lacks the sense of religion, the spirit of faith, to
expound, or even to understand, the ideals of the Jew, whose history
throughout the past was but one continuous glorification of the only
one God, by the master works of its hundreds and thousands of men of
learning and the unparalleled martyrdom of the whole people, and whose
future is humanity made one by the belief in the only one God and
Father. Therefore, let me give you, delegates and members of the
Intercollegiate Menorah Association, the advice to continue as you
started, as an academic, cosmopolitan association, yet at the same
time let it be linked to the synagogue of each city as the center of
the faith. Let your watch-word be true to the symbol of                                                          
"arise and shine," and give light to all the nations. Let your
inspiration and your power of enlightening the world ever come fresh
from the sanctuary of faith, as of yore, and you will not only be all
the more honored for this loyalty to the spirit of the past and the
spirit of the American people which is religious, but the sweetest
delight that comes from the classic world of beauty will reflect only
the brighter light of the holiness, the beauty of holiness, that comes
from Israel's one God.


Prof. I. Leo Sharfman

WE want all that is worthy in the Jewish past to be made a potent
force in the American life of the present. You men and women who are
students at our universities cannot perform your full duty to your
universities unless you add to the richness of the university life, to
the variety of its content, to its genuineness and versatility. And in
the larger American community we Jews cannot perform our full duty
unless we place at the disposal of our country the best fruits of the
Jewish spirit. Our Menorah allegiance, then, rests on the foundation
of Americanism. And insofar as, through the Menorah movement, we are
succeeding in uniting by a common bond men and women who have been
brought up under a great variety of circumstances and conditions, we
are increasing the democratic spirit of our universities and of the
larger life beyond the academic gates. Within the universities, too,
the broadening effect of the Menorah idea is not limited to the
student body. I can bear witness from personal experience that the
university authorities, both faculty members and administrative
officers, are not merely tolerating, or even mildly accepting, the
work of our Menorah Societies in their midst, but are themselves being
led to a better understanding of the place which the Jewish problem
occupies[124] in the larger problem of their universities and of the
American community for whose service they are training the youth of
the land.


Menorah and Religion

I HAVE said that the aim of the Menorah movement is the study and
advancement of Hebraic culture and ideals. The culture of a people is
but the permanent expression of its ideals in the various activities
of life. Religion constitutes one of the most important of human
activities, and we in the Menorah Societies are fully cognizant of its
fundamental importance. Indeed, we recognize that the ideals of the
Jewish people are perhaps expressed more truly, more profoundly, more
eloquently in our religious literature than in any other manifestation
of the Jewish genius. We should not be charged with excluding
religion, merely because we aim to include more than religion in our
purposes and activities.

I happen at the present time to be teaching at the University of
Michigan, at Ann Arbor. We have there a Menorah Society, devoted to
the general object to which all our Menorah Societies are devoted. We
listen to speakers and engage in discussions on Jewish history, Jewish
literature, Jewish religion, and current Jewish social, economic and
political problems. Side by side with the Menorah Society there exists
a Jewish Student Congregation, a body of men and women of which I feel
it a privilege to have been one of the organizers and to be a member
at the present time, which devotes itself entirely to religious
activity, to regular weekly worship. The two organizations do not
conflict in any way. It is significant that about ninety-five per
cent, if not more, of the members of the Michigan Menorah Society
attend regularly the services of the Jewish Student Congregation.
Unfortunately, not so large a percentage of the members of the
congregation attend the meetings or are members of the Michigan
Menorah Society. In the course of time, the relationship between the
two organizations will doubtless be adjusted more satisfactorily. But
in the experience at Michigan we have a concrete illustration of the
spur to religion which Menorah men derive from their participation in
Menorah work.

The ideal of the Menorah Societies is a non-partisan ideal. We do not
stand for Zionism or anti-Zionism; we do not urge the acceptance of
reform Judaism or conservative Judaism or orthodox Judaism; we do not
favor the German Jew as against the Russian Jew, or vice versa, nor do
we appeal to one social class as against another. We want the Menorah
ideal to be broad enough to include every Jew. We do not exclude
religion as such from the scope of our interests; we but exclude any
insistence upon a particular sect or branch or kind of Judaism. We
avoid all partisan activity which may tend to disorganize our Jewish
students, which may tend to divide them. That is all.


A Plea for Tolerance

I BELIEVE that what we need in our universities, what we need in the
Jewish community, is more insistence upon Judaism and more light upon
the inspiration which Judaism can bring us, and less insistence upon
the particular kind of Judaism which you or I or some one else may
consider the acme of truth. Indifference to religion and not error in
religion is the great danger of these modern times. If we really want
religion, if we want to stir again the Jew's traditional passion for
religion, if we want to inspire once more the Jew's genius for
religion, let us try to understand all aspects and all manifestations
of it, let us bend our efforts to a renaissance of religious
influence. The future of the Jew in this country will not be
determined by the theories or the practices of any one group or sect
of Jews. The result will be a composite result, to which the reform
Jew and the Zionist, the orthodox Jew and the anti-Zionist, will alike
contribute. Let us leave it to the growing generation to determine for
itself the content of the theory of life best suited to the future
destiny of the Jew. At least, within our university walls let us be
tolerant, let us be liberal-minded, let us listen to and understand
every man's point of view.[125]


Mr. Hurwitz

IN the free and honest expression of adverse views which we have heard
to-night, this, indeed, has been a characteristic Menorah meeting. It
may fittingly be closed by a word from one of our staunchest friends,
one of our staunchest friends because he is an ardent and
public-spirited Jew and a patriotic American, Justice Irving Lehman of
the Supreme Court of the State of New York, the Chairman of the
Graduate Menorah Committee. He addresses this word to the convention:

"I am very sorry that I am unable to attend the
convention of the Association this year. I feel that
during the past year we have made some progress upon
which you have reason to congratulate yourselves, but
we must remember that our movement is still far from
having the force and power which I think it deserves.
We have a great and difficult task to perform if we
are to succeed in bringing back to the Jewish youth a
pride in their Jewish heritage and a knowledge of
their Jewish past, and I know that such work is worthy
of all effort. I trust that your convention may
possess the spirit and the wisdom necessary to further
the work, and I wish to renew to you my assurance of
willing co-operation."


II. The Luncheon

THE fifth session of the Convention was a luncheon in the Hotel
Gibson, attended by the delegates, university students and graduates
in Cincinnati, and members of the Faculties of the University of
Cincinnati and the Hebrew Union College. Prof. I. Leo Sharfman,
President of the Intercollegiate Menorah Association, was the
Toastmaster. Chancellor Hurwitz spoke for five minutes upon the
purposes and progress of the Menorah movement. President Abraham J.
Feldman of the University of Cincinnati Menorah Society expressed
gratification at the honor accorded to his Menorah Society by the
Convention and appealed to the graduates and prominent members of the
community present for support in the work of the Cincinnati Menorah
Society. The other speakers were Dean Joseph E. Harry of the
University of Cincinnati, Dr. Moses Barron, Representative from the
University of Minnesota, Dr. Louis Grossmann of Hebrew Union College,
Dr. Samuel Iglauer, graduate of the University of Cincinnati, Walter
M. Shohl, graduate of Harvard University, Dr. Kaufman Kohler,
President of Hebrew Union College, Prof. Julian Morgenstern of Hebrew
Union College, Dr. H. M. Kallen of the University of Wisconsin, and
Dr. David Philipson of Hebrew Union College. Following are somewhat
abridged reports of the speeches:


Dean J. E. Harry

I DID not know that I was going to be called upon today, or I should
certainly have tried to fortify myself, as the old darky in Virginia
said when his master sent him down to another part of the plantation
to see if the rebels were fortifying the place: "Massa, they am not
only fortyfying it; they am fiftyfying it!"

I am glad that our Chancellor here to my right said that the speeches
were to be brief. I think that an after-dinner speaker who makes a
long speech ought to have about the same punishment that the member of
parliament mentioned when he introduced a bill, "The only way to stop
suicide is to make it a capital offense, punishable by death."

But I have always tried to avoid redundancy of expression. I would
never say a "wealthy plumber," nor a "poor poet," nor for that matter
a "poor professor."



"Vessels of wrath, we pedagogues;
Better we were dead,
Who, by the wrath of Peleus' son,
Must earn our daily bread."


Nor would I say an "interesting Menorah Association meeting." That
they[126] are interesting goes without saying, if we can judge from the
one we had last night.

I am exceedingly interested in real culture, and being an American,
and knowing, as I do, what the Jews in America can do for the
advancement of learning, of knowledge and of the humanities, I am
interested in the Menorah movement, which will tend to bring this
about; and it is when we reflect upon the war in Europe today, with
all its sickening horrors and what that means to culture (we can
hardly comprehend it yet), what an obstacle to learning, that we may
exclaim with that old bibliophile, Richard de Bury:

"O pacis auctor et amator altissime! dissipa gentes bella volentes qu       
super omnes pestilentias libris nocent."

And by "libris" he meant culture.


Dr. Moses Barron

MINNESOTA brings its greeting to the Intercollegiate Menorah
Association as one of the very earliest Menorah Societies. It was
really originated in 1903, when a handful of students in the
University found it desirable to satisfy certain longings by taking up
the study of Jewish history and literature. Some of us had found that
it was of little avail to cry over the ashes of the past, and we
thought that it would be much more proper to try and study the
history, the literature, the ideals of the past for the inspiration to
be found there, which might better fit us to cope with the problems of
the present and the future. Our Society has grown from a mere handful
to an enthusiastic company, so that we have from fifty to
seventy-five, and even a hundred, attending our regular meetings. I
give this fact simply to show what a profound influence the work of
the Menorah has been, what an influence it necessarily must have in
the future, in promulgating Jewish culture, Jewish thought and ideals.


Dr. Louis Grossmann

I AM reminded by our Chairman of the time when he was still a student
at Harvard, in the earliest days of the Menorah movement, when I
addressed the Menorah Society there. It was in the room of the
Chancellor, unless I am mistaken, and there were a number of students.
They were grouped about, some in chairs, some sitting on the floor,
some perched on window sills, while others improvised seats on the
furniture. I felt myself patriarchal in the midst of these young men.
It was a remarkable scene and it was a remarkably helpful evening,
helpful and refreshing to me. The pulses of youth always beat high and
I caught the elation of it. Who would not have been touched by it?
Some of these young men have since become leaders in thought and
action, and I am not surprised.

Let me make a confession as to that evening. I not only felt a thrill
but made also some observations. These young men had their ideals, but
they had also their difficulties. And they spoke of them. We had an
exchange of thought and of candor such as comes to a man in the
ministry and to a teacher of students but rarely. They told me of
their doubts. Young men, serious young minds, always will have their
doubts. They want to earn their convictions. I hope the day will never
come when young men will not insist on seeing things. These young men
were quick-witted and ready with repartee and counter-argument, and I
saw in each eye a glint of an ideal. The debate was strong, but the
ideals were stronger.


The Power of Ideals

IDEALS are pulses that beat in their own way. An ideal is a fact of
the soul; it is more than a definition or an argument. An ideal is
always very certain and nobody wants to disprove it, nor can.

I notice the Menorah Association has for its aim the cultivation of
ideals. It is natural that young men, with red blood in them, should
hold dear the precious dreams of what might and should be. As I look
upon ideals now, through the perspective of years, I see they have
both strength as well as limitations. But I know that, however much
life and experience challenges them, they are the best force in us. I
respect and value them so much that I deplore the waste of the[127] least
of them. An ideal is a moral ambition, a great wish of a true, even if
a bit naive, soul. And it should have the right of way.

Every work in life implies stern necessity and a fine wish. I am
reminded of a bridge in Berlin which the Germans have built with
inimitable art and truth. There are four groups, each at a corner. On
one an elderly man stands erect and writing. It is History, stern and
real. At his side stands a boy, lithe and graceful. There are ideals
just as much as Law in the affairs of men. On the other side of the
bridge stands another symbol of the two forces in Life: a man carrying
a bundle, a bent man, who has borne the brunt of the pioneer days, and
next to him also a youth. Commerce, however sordid, still implies
morality and the generous side of man. On the third side stands the
solemn figure of Religion, sober and haggard, the symbol of Faith and
martyrdom. And the young man, next to it, seems sprightly and strong.
Why must Religion be interpreted as dispensing comfort alone? Should
it not also give strength and joy? In the last corner stands
Pestalozzi, the teacher, and a boy looks up into his kind face. We
crave for action and capability more than for knowledge and facts. And
we crave for love more than for truth, and the real truth brings
affections and enthusiasm.

In the meetings of your Association you speak often of ideals, you
speak of them fervently. But ideals are not merely academic. They are
personal. An ideal becomes yourself, if it is yours at all. It is a
dynamic force within you. It pervades your whole being. It is an
unseen but a very telling strength. It directs you, and it sends you
on your errand of life. You cannot rest satisfied merely to know your
ideal and to speculate about it. It is the engine of warfare in your
career. Study ideals, not to contemplate and analyze, but to emulate
them and to fill yourself with them. You have work to do. And work is
more insistent than philosophy. You have work to do which no one else
can do for you, or may do for you. An ideal is your Self at the
highest power.

You with fresh energies, you with the clear eye of healthy youth, you
with unoppressed hearts, you at the beginning of life, you should go
at your work splendidly, directly, forcefully. The real idealist is a
man of action, of untiring activity. Do things and you verify what you
plan. You have the privilege of youth. Have also the pride of youth.
Keep it sweet, but keep it also strong.


Dr. Samuel Iglauer

THE Menorah Society appeals to me as a college graduate not only for
many of its positive virtues but also for some of its negative merits.
It is not in any sense a social organization, and above all it is not
a secret society. Now I have my own peculiar views about secret
societies in universities, and I do not believe that they tend to
promote college spirit and college unity. It has been well said that
in these societies those who are in any particular societies are
brothers, while every one else who belongs to another society, or to
no society whatever, is just a step-brother. To my mind that is not a
good spirit in an American institution.

It seems to me that, having in this city a Hebrew Union College with a
gifted faculty, we should establish at our University a Department of
Semitics. Since the University is a public school, an institution
supported by public taxation, it certainly could not affiliate
directly with a sectarian institution, but I see no reason why the
professors in the Hebrew College, if they are not already overworked
like the students, should not be able to conduct courses at the
University itself, and I believe such courses would promote the
Menorah movement more than anything else you could do. I think you
would attract students from far and wide to the University of
Cincinnati, and you would thereby achieve one of the ends for which
you are working.


Mr. Walter M. Shohl

IT is gratifying to me to attend this meeting of the Menorah, because,
as the Chairman has said, I heard the flapping[128] of the wings of the
stork at its birth. I recall very well the preliminary meetings that
we had when the organization of the Menorah Society at Cambridge was
first spoken of. At that time I was one of the doubters; I held back.
There were in Cambridge a number of societies, social primarily, that
did not desire members of our faith among their number. I felt that a
movement which was composed entirely of Jewish men would be mistaken
for an effort at a Jewish fraternity that was to take the place of the
fraternities in which we were not welcome. The other men, however,
felt that we could have a society the purposes of which had nothing to
do with social matters, and that we could bring out all that was good
in Jewish matters of culture and develop a society to promote those
interests. So at first somewhat reluctantly, I joined in with the
movement, and the result has justified their farsightedness, and I am
sorry now that I was only a "trailer" in the beginning.

The position of the Menorah movement and what it stands for calls to
mind a story that was told in Montreal a couple of years ago by Lord
Haldane, who came to America to attend a meeting of the American Bar
Association. A part of the story was recited in verse (which I do not
recall exactly) and had to do with an Englishman who was taken
prisoner in one of the countries of the Far East, and was offered his
choice between conversion to the religion of his captors or death. He
was a man who had no particular religious feelings; he was not
religious when at home. However, he felt that first and foremost he
was an Englishman and that if he were to do anything base it would
reflect upon all those ideals which were so dear to him, and therefore
he cast in his lot and chose against the change of religion. So, too,
with some of us who perhaps are not religious in a formal way; the
realization of the great things that have been accomplished in the
past by Jews, the Jewish historical background, is in itself a shield
to us, and the realization of what Judaism is and stands for must act
to prevent us from doing something that would be unworthy of
ourselves and of the religion of which we are a part.


Dr. Kaufman Kohler

THIS comes rather unawares, but I wish to be very brief in stating
that, while I listened to the very interesting and suggestive remarks
that were made all along this table, and also on recalling what we
heard last night, I feel glad, after all, from the point of view of
the Hebrew Union College, that the Intercollegiate Menorah Association
has come here to make propaganda for its work, at the same time
receiving perhaps new direction and new ideas about the work they have
so nobly begun. The fact that the work       started, as we heard, at
Harvard in 1906       has made such progress shows that at least there was
something in the young Jewish student at the colleges that called for
the creation of such an association and such kind of work. Perhaps I
may say that those who had their misgivings as to the tendencies of
the Menorah Association are now at least informed that some of these
misgivings or suspicions were not well founded. I personally will say
that I had the impression that there was too much of nationalism or
Zionism behind the movement, and that the movement was not, from the
point of view of the Hebrew Union College or my humble self, one
deserving encouragement and support. I have learned to change some of
my views and some of my impressions as to the purpose and intention of
this movement. There is a well-known quotation, for those who know a
little German:





"Das sind die Weisen,
Die vom Irrtum zur Wahrheit reisen;
Das sind die Narren,
Die beim Irrtum beharren."


I am not one of those who insist on views once maintained though later
found faulty. I am rather ready to change my views, especially after
what I heard today from my honored neighbor (Prof. I. L. Sharfman) and
from what he said last night that the religious idea of Judaism is not
ignored but is held in view.

All Jews who are Jews must believe that Judaism stands for an
uncompromising[129] monotheistic truth, while the world around us has
compromised the same. Therefore we, as Jews, must always insist upon
the maintenance of the pure monotheistic idea for which we suffered
and struggled, and for which our fathers died. We must maintain this
as the mainstay and vital principle of Judaism. For this very reason,
and for no other, we insist, especially from the point of view of a
Jewish theological college, that this idea of a pure Jewish religion,
the pure monotheistic idea, must be held unshakenly and without any
change or any concession. And for that very reason we could not and
will not say that race is everything. We cannot admit that a pure race
is the best, and that a pure Jew is he who has maintained solely
everything Jewish and not allowed the Greek culture to be assimilated
in order to sublimate and spiritualize and idealize the truth
inherited. For Ruppin and the Nationalists who follow him, the poor
Jews, the ghetto Jews, of Russia who speak Yiddish and live only an
exclusive narrow life, are five-fifths Jews, while the Jews in free
and civilized lands are only half Jews. Now against this, we of the
Hebrew Union College, we who represent progressive or reformed
Judaism, must protest. We must insist that the Jewish race, the Jewish
people or nation, if you want to call it so, can form only the body;
Judaism, the Jewish religion, is the soul. And we will always stand
not merely for the body, not merely for the material side, not merely
for race, which is the lowest kind of life, but for the spirit, the
soul of Judaism, and that is its religious truth.


Prof. Julian Morgenstern

I BELIEVE that it is one of the positive aims of the Menorah Society
to recognize the Jewish side of much that enters, or should enter,
into our daily life, to develop our full consciousness of all that is
essentially and fundamentally Jewish, and thus enable us to live
positive and constructive Jewish lives. It is a noble aim, to which I
unrestrictedly subscribe. Whenever I hear public speakers or writers
pat Jews and Judaism on the back, and patronizingly tell us, "Oh, you
Jews are all right," I am, as no doubt most of us are, deeply
chagrined, to use a mild expression. What we want is not that others
should appreciate us and tell us that we are all right. What we want,
and what we need, is that we should appreciate ourselves and that we
should take ourselves seriously and at our full value. Not that we
should over-appreciate ourselves and think ourselves alone the salt of
the earth. There is such a thing as over-appreciation that must in the
end lead to futility and vanity. But equally, there is such a thing as
self-depreciation, and to a certain extent I cannot but feel that we
Jews have been more or less guilty of that in the past, have more or
less, particularly in our college and university life, assumed a
deprecating attitude, apologizing as it were for our existence as
Jews, and, probably unconsciously, have kept the fact of our Judaism
in the background, and suffered our education and our culture to
influence almost everything but our Jewish knowledge and our Jewish
life.

For right appreciation, which shall be neither over-appreciation nor
under-appreciation, but true appreciation, based upon a correct
estimation of all essentials, the first requisite is knowledge,
thorough knowledge of all conditions, forces and influences. And the
second requisite is pride, pride in this knowledge and in the object
of this knowledge. And this, translated into the Menorah language,
means, as I understand it, correct knowledge of Judaism, of our Jewish
history, our Jewish past, our Jewish heritage, our Jewish religion,
and pride in all this Judaism       a knowledge and pride that alone can
enable us to know what Judaism truly is, and what its work and its
mission for the present and the future must be, that alone can enable
us to live positively and constructively as Jews and perpetuate our
Judaism for the blessing of ourselves, our children, and all mankind.
So I interpret the Menorah movement. And I heartily welcome such a
movement, whose aim is the awakening of our Jewish college young men
and women to a wholesome and genuine appreciation[130] of themselves, of
the Jewish side of their lives, of their Jewish consciousness and
Jewish obligations, of the full meaning and responsibility imposed
upon them by their subscribing to the name Jew, and their adherence to
the religion of our fathers. We must look to our college-bred Jewish
men and women to become the guiding spirits in our Judaism of
to-morrow and of all the future. And I say, "Thank God for any
movement that must surely lead to this goal."


Dr. H. M. Kallen

SINCE this seems to be the occasion for reminiscence, I want to take
the liberty of recalling for you an episode of the formation of the
Menorah Society at Harvard. It turned on the question of the right
form of stating the object of the Society and you will remember
perhaps that the object is stated in these terms: "The Harvard Menorah
Society for the study and advancement of Hebraic culture and
ideals"       not Jewish, not Judaistic, but Hebraic. The persons who
agitated the use of the term Hebraic had certain very definite
literary and historic and social relationships in mind.

To begin with, the word Judaism, in the English language, stands
exclusively for a religion. It is co-ordinate with the word
Christianity, the word Buddhism, the word Zoroastrianism, with any
word that stands exclusively for a religion. Now in the history of the
Jewish people, there was a time when Judaism did not exist, and if I
understand the gentlemen who represent the Reform sect correctly       I
speak under correction       the intention of the Reform movement is a
reversion in fact to the religious attitude of the pre-Judaistic
period in the history of the religion of the Jewish people. It is
"prophetic" or "progressive Judaism" for which they stand, I gather,
in contrast with the "Talmudical Judaism," of the larger orthodox
sect. But the period of the great prophets is not the period of
Judaism, and strictly speaking, the term Judaism excludes the
prophetic element as an active force in Jewish life. This is
significant, and to me the significance seems tremendous, for so far
as my personal sympathies are concerned they go entirely with the
prophetic aspects of Judaism, or better, of Hebraism.


Hebraism and Judaism

HEBRAISM and Judaism are words now in the English language and their
usage is determined for us entirely by the writers who become
authoritative either by their style or through the weight of their
opinion, and this usage has given the term Hebraism a meaning such
that it stands for the entire spirit of the Jew, not only in religion
but in all that is Jewish; in English the term Hebraism covers the
total biography of the Jewish soul, while the term Judaism stands only
for a portion of it. Now the Jewish soul is the important thing, but
no one has ever met a soul without a body (at least the people who
claim they have met it are still required, for belief, to show
evidence more than they have thus far shown); generally speaking, soul
and body are co-ordinate and mutually imply each other. You cannot
have one without the other. This is even more the case when you are
dealing not with an individual but with a people. Hence it is the
history of the Jewish body-politic with which Hebraism and its
components, including Judaism, co-ordinate.

For this reason the gentlemen who stated the object of the Society in
the constitution of the Harvard Menorah Society were compelled to take
into consideration the following historic fact: There was a time in
the history of mankind when religion and life were coincident. You
know that the prophets were reformers. The orthodox religion which
they fought was the religion of the land. They were progressive
religionists, just as the gentlemen who are in the Reform sect to-day
claim to be progressive religionists. When they established their
religion, it became the religion of the whole nationality, for all
ancient religion is national religion. Religion for the Greeks, and
religion for the Jews, and religion for the Syrians, and for the
Babylonians, and the Romans, was essentially[131] national and political,
and the political nationalism of religion in the time of the Roman
Empire was the immediate basis for the persecution of the Jews by the
Romans. The latter persecuted the Jews not primarily because they
disliked the Jews, but because the Jews were a political danger in
their refusal to worship the representative of the State in the shape
of the Emperor. But in the development of civilization, religion
became detached from the totality of civilized living. In the
progressive division of labor religion became specialized. The
priestly group learned to confine itself more and more to the "things
of the spirit"       cult, ritual, dogma, while the other elements in
civilization loomed larger and larger. Religion remained social, but
society was no longer religious. Life was secularized. I think that
the representatives of the Reform sect, in one of their conferences,
declared that America is not a Christian country. In so doing they
acknowledged this fact.


Continuity of the Jewish Spirit

THROUGHOUT the history of the Jewish people, there is a continuity of
spirit which is very different from the continuity of form that
attends both the secular and the religious developments of Jewish
life. This is the same in both these aspects of Jewish life       in the
secular Jewish poetry and thought of the middle ages and up to the
present day. Even a Bergson, ostensibly a Frenchman, expresses in his
philosophy what is essentially the Hebraic conception of the nature of
reality and the destiny of man. From Amos through Job, through the
philosophers of the middle ages, to Ahad Ha-'Am there is a clear and
accountable continuity. Finally, there is the development of the whole
of the secular life of modern Jewry, in Yiddish and in Hebrew. Yiddish
may be unpleasant, but Yiddish is no less the speech of the Jews than
English, no less the speech of the Jews than Aramaic, and Arabic and
Ladino, and all of these have acquired literary and qualitative
characteristics which are identical as expressions of the spirit of
the Jew, of the Hebraic spirit.

This may be seen generally in the case of Yiddish alone. Yiddish, as
you know, is a German dialect; it is middle high German in its base,
and German is an inflected language; its rhythms are essentially long,
periodic, indeterminate, radically different from the rhythms of
Hebrew, involving a different kind of co-ordination and mode. But
compare Yiddish with German, and you find quite an antagonistic
literary quality. Yiddish reads like the Psalms, and the Bible, and
the Talmud; it doesn't read like German until it is Germanized. The
whole genius of the tongue has been altered by Jewish use so that its
spiritual quality has taken on the quality of the race that uses the
tongue, and its literary kinship has become Hebraic.

Again, there is this whole mass of neo-English, neo-Russian,
neo-German literatures which, written by Jews, deal with the life of
the Jews, with their interests and character. This is not religious.
What is its relation to Jewry? Yet again, there is any number of
Jewish individuals, among whom I must count myself, who find it
impossible to adjust their consciences with any official type of
theological doctrine, who are interested in discovering the truth, and
are compelled to acknowledge that no truth has been discovered
finally, once and for all; there are hundreds and thousands such. What
is to be their relation to their people if Jews are to be considered
members merely of Judaistic sects? Yet Jews they are, and if they do
not contribute directly to Judaism, they do contribute to Hebraism.

Hebraism stands not for that particular expression of the Jewish mind,
religion, but for all that has appeared in Jewish history, both
religious and secular. The term Judaism stands for that partial
expression of the Jewish genius which is religious.


The Ethical Motive of Judaism

IT has been said that the genius of the Jew is entirely religious. I
do not think that that is historically a demonstrable proposition. For
the dominant motive even in Judaism is not[132] a religious motive. It is
an ethical motive. Judaism does not conceive its God as requiring man
to be damned for his glory. It conceives its God as an instrument by
the worship of whom "thy days may be lengthened in the land."
Righteousness and not salvation is the aim even of the Jewish
religion. Hebraism is the name for this living spirit which demands
righteousness, expressed in all the different interests in which Jews,
as Jews, have a share       in art, science, philosophy and social
organization and in religion. Hebraism, hence, is a wider term than
religion and its continuity embraces, but is not embraced by, the
continuity of religion.

Now the Harvard Menorah Society, taking this fact into consideration,
made use, because of the tradition of English usage, of the term
"Hebraic." It recognized that since Hebraism is more comprehensive
than Judaism, many people might be Hebraists who are not and need not
be Judaists. It refused to exclude them from a share in Jewish life
and an opportunity for Jewish service. The organization goes on the
principle       both the Intercollegiate and the constituent
Societies       that nothing Jewish is alien to it. For this reason the
Menorah takes no sides; for this reason it is Hebraic and not
Judaistic. For this reason it welcomes everything Jewish without
exception       theological and secular, Russian, German, French, English.
It requires only that a thing shall be Jewish, that it shall be a
possible part of the organic total we call Hebraism.

Hebraism is the flower and fruit of the whole of Jewish life. Its
root is the ethnic nationality of the Jewish people, and with this
also the secularizing reformers agree when they prohibit and
discourage the marriage of Jew with Gentile.

Many of us, however, are not content with merely the status quo.
Throughout the nineteenth century it has thrown us into a series of
dishonorable compromises. We want a condition       I speak now for myself
and not for the Menorah       we want a condition in which the genius of
the Jew, the Hebraic spirit, may express itself without any need of
compromise. The orthodox Jew, at least, retains his integrity with his
darkness. But we are in danger of losing our integrity. We concede to
our environment point after point. But we are not liberated in spirit
by these concessions; we are merely turned into amateur Gentiles. The
orthodox sectary makes no concession to environment, and tends to
petrify and die. The reformed sectary makes too many, and tends to
dissolve and die. This is the penalty for the status quo.

Life, to be sure, consists of compromise and concession. But for
integral living we must make them as masters, not serfs. There must be
one place where the ancestral spirit of the Jew will not need to adapt
itself to the world, but will, like the English or French spirit,
adapt the world to itself. That place is determined nationally, just
as the places of all European culture are determined nationally and
racially.


The Aspiration for a Jewish State

PRIDE in ancestry is not pride of race, but pride in the spirit of the
race, and pride of ancestry is not pride merely of background, but
pride in the obligations that ancestry sets. All aristocrats have one
motto       it is noblesse oblige. This must be the motto of the Jew. We
must hence carry our obligation in the spirit of the prophets, which
is not primarily a theological spirit, but a purely humane spirit, for
which the necessity of man determines the invocation of God; in which
the ideal of a free and happy humanity, in a just and democratic
society, is the dominating ideal; in which a righteous Jewish state is
a persistent aspiration. This is the Hebraism which must underly all
the activities of the Menorah Association.

This Hebraism, academically realized through study, must be realized
in the lives of individuals through work, as Dr. Grossmann has well
said, and in the life of the great Jewish mass in a free Jewish state.
Every ideal we acquire from the past must be turned into a fact of the
present. Noblesse oblige![133]


Dr. David Philipson

I AM reminded that this day marks the one hundredth anniversary of the
signing of the Treaty of Ghent       one hundred years of peace between
English-speaking peoples. I need to be reminded of this after the
speech that has just been made, because much that was said has quite
fired my fighting spirit       but this is a day of peace and it might not
be quite in the spirit of this anniversary day to say all I might
otherwise say in answer to the points that have been made and with
which I differ radically.

There are some things in Dr. Kallen's eloquent address that I do
believe, but there are many more things with which I do not agree. But
let that be as it may, I was very much interested in his remark, that
the "Reform sect," as he is pleased to call us, harks back to the
prophets. This has been claimed frequently by the reformers
themselves, but he puts a new interpretation upon it; he says the
prophets were pre-Judaistic. This is the Christian point of view. They
claim that Judaism was the growth of the post-exilic period, but we
reformers interpret the term Judaism altogether differently.


The Significance of Reform Judaism

JUDAISM means for us the Jewish religion and all that this implies; if
the Reform movement in its beginnings went back to prophetism it was
simply for this reason       that the pioneers of the Reform movement
recognized that the Jews had fallen into the very condition that Dr.
Kallen deprecates, namely, they had gotten away from life inasmuch as
they had been confined to the ghetto where they had been excluded from
the currents of contemporary life. Judaism had become a ghetto
religion, and because of this divorce between life and religion the
Reform movement arose. The Reform movement is not simply a matter of
creed. It affects the whole life of the Jew. One of its basic
principles is that the religion of the Jew must square with his life;
the needs of the Jew in the modern environment must be taken into
consideration by Jewish leaders; Reform Judaism, far from making a
separation and raising a barrier between the Jew and life, as those
who call us reformed sectarians like to say       quite to the contrary,
reconciles the Jew to the civilization in which he is living and
wherein his children are growing up. This, to my mind, is the great
significance of the Reform movement, and I believe that all those who
truly understand it look upon it in that way.

The Reform movement, as the movement for religious emancipation, was
the accompaniment of similar emancipatory movements affecting the Jews
at the close of the eighteenth century. First there was the linguistic
emancipation when under the leadership of Moses Mendelssohn the Jews
of Germany discarded the use of the German-Jewish jargon or Yiddish,
the language of the Jew's degradation, (for there would have been no
such thing as Yiddish had the Jew not been degraded and excluded as he
was in the countries of Europe) and began the employment of pure
German. Secondly, there was the educational emancipation. The Jews had
been educated in chedarim where they received instruction only in
Hebrew branches and no so-called secular education whatsoever. This
separated the Jew from the culture of the world. At the close of the
eighteenth century German Jews began to attend schools and
universities. Gradually this took place also in other countries.
Thirdly, there was the civil or political emancipation, when after the
French Revolution the countries of western Europe, one after the
other, accorded the Jews the rights of men. The Reform movement or, in
other words, the religious emancipation, is simply the result of great
world forces, as embodied in these various aspects of emancipation,
and for this reason the Reform movement, far from being simply a
matter of creed or theological belief, made the Jew a citizen of the
world and fitted him for the modern environment.


The "Body and Soul" of Jewry

NOW there is one other point made by the previous speaker to which I
feel that I must refer and that is the[134] matter of "body and soul."
This is a favorite phrase of Zionist writers and speakers as
emphasizing the difference between Zionists and reformers. We
reformers also believe that the body Jewish is necessary, but in a
sense different from the Zionistic claim that the Jewish nation must
be re-established. I as a reformer and a non-Zionist also use the term
"the Jewish people," but in the sense of a "religious people," not a
"political people." This involves a vital distinction       the distinction
between religionism and nationalism. Yes, I also believe that the
body, the religious community, is necessary. The reform rabbinical
conference declared against intermarriage for the very reason that it
is all important that the Jewish people, the mamleket kohanim, the
goy kadosh, be the vessel embodying the religious idea, the spirit.
But let it be understood clearly that nationally we are poles apart
from the Zionists. Nationally I am an American. I also feel that we
ought not to have hyphenated Americans, but Americans pure and simple.
In that sense I am nationally an American without a hyphen.
Religiously I am a Jew, and religiously I am part and parcel of the
Jewish people with whom my religious fortunes are intertwined.
Further, I feel very much as Dr. Kallen does in regard to our duty
towards the Jews made destitute by the murderous European war. They
have none else to look to and we must help them; for whatever may be
our differences, we must stand united in this pressing duty of the
hour, this work of mercy. But may God speed the day when the Jews in
Poland, Russia and Roumania will receive full rights so that
nationally they may be considered Poles, Russians or Roumanians as are
all others in those lands, as is the case here in free America. To my
mind this is the only effective solution to the so-called Jewish
problem in those countries.

Freedom is the Messiah that is still to come to the Jews in the lands
where they are oppressed, so that everywhere they may be at one in the
rights of citizenship with their fellow countrymen, differing from
them in their religion alone. This is the great distinction I desired
to draw between the Jew nationally and the Jew as a member of a
religious people; this "religious people" is the body of which Judaism
is the soul.


Prof. Sharfman

I AM constrained to close this meeting with a statement similar to
that made by our Chancellor at the conclusion of the public meeting
last evening. This was a typical Menorah discussion. We are an open
forum for all points of view. We are glad to hear Dr. Kallen's
opinions; we are glad to hear Dr. Philipson's opinions. I am sure that
out of this clash of views will come a better understanding of the
Menorah idea, a truer and deeper realization of the strivings of our
Menorah movement.[135]


III. The Business Sessions


First Session

CALLED to order in the Faculty Room, McMicken Hall, at 11 A.M., by
President I. Leo Sharfman. N. M. Lyon, of the University of
Cincinnati, was appointed Secretary pro tem.

Upon the presentation of credentials, the following were seated as the
Representatives of their respective Menorah Societies in the
Administrative Council: College of the City of New York, George J.
Horowitz; Columbia University, M. David Hoffman; University of
Illinois, Sidney Casner; University of Michigan, Jacob Levin;
University of Minnesota, Dr. Moses Barron; Ohio State University,
Herman Lebeson; University of Wisconsin, Dr. Horace M. Kallen. And the
following were seated as Deputies: Clark University, Philip
Wascerwitz; Harvard University, George A. Dreyfous; Johns Hopkins
University, Jerome Mark; New York University, S. Felix Mendelson;

The applications for admission into the Association of the Menorah
Societies at Brown University, University of Cincinnati, Hunter
College, University of Maine, the Universities in the City of Omaha,
Radcliffe College, Valparaiso University, and University of Washington
were presented. After due consideration of the facts in each case and
the statements of the University authorities, all of the applications
were accepted and the Menorah Societies named were formally admitted
into the Association by the unanimous vote of the Administrative
Council.

Upon the presentation of their credentials, the following were seated
as Representatives: University of Cincinnati, Abraham J. Feldman; the
Universities in the City of Omaha, Jacques Rieur; Valparaiso
University, Florence Turner. And the following were seated as
Deputies: Radcliffe College, S. Marie Pichel; Hunter College, Naomi
Rasinsky.

The role of Representatives and Deputies was read by the Secretary,
and the dues of the several Menorah Societies to the Intercollegiate
Menorah Association for 1915 were paid.

Chancellor Henry Hurwitz read a letter of greeting to the Convention
from Justice Irving Lehman of New York, Chairman of the Graduate
Advisory Menorah Committee. (See page 125.)


Second Session

Called to order by President Sharfman at 3 P.M. in the Faculty Room,
McMicken Hall. Chancellor Hurwitz delivered the report of the Officers
for 1914.


Abstract of Officers' Report for 1914

In his report in behalf of the Officers, the Chancellor referred to
the organization in the past year of the eight Menorah Societies which
were admitted into the Intercollegiate Menorah Association at the
previous session of the Convention, making in all thirty-five
constituent Societies, every one having arisen spontaneously at its
college or university, with the full approval and encouragement of the
authorities. Additional Societies are in the process of formation at
several other universities.

With reference to the organization of Graduate Menorah Societies, the
time was deemed inopportune to proceed definitely in the matter, the
war situation absorbing the attention and energies of so many of those
who would otherwise be interested in the idea of Graduate Menorah
organization, and it was recommended that detailed consideration of
the question be laid over another year. But[136] a beginning of Graduate
organization has already been made in Scranton, Pa., where a Graduate
Menorah Society has been formed.

The Intercollegiate Menorah Association has been very cordially
invited to join the Corda Fratres International Federation of
Students, whose objects are: "To unite student movements and
organizations throughout the world, to study student problems of every
nature, and to promote among students closer international relations,
mutual understandings and friendship; to encourage the study of
international relations and problems; to stimulate a sympathetic
appreciation of the character, problems and intellectual currents of
other nations; to facilitate foreign study, and to increase its value
and fruitfulness. The movement is neutral in all special religious,
political and economic principles." (From the official declaration of
principles.) The Corda Fratres at present comprises the following
national organizations as its constituents: Consulates of Corda
Fratres in Italy, Holland, Hungary and Greece; the Association
Generale des Etudiants de Paris, and the Union Nationale des
Associations des Etudiants de France; the Verband der Internationalen
Studentenverein in Germany; the Liga de Estudiantes Americanos,
including student organizations in the Argentine Republic, Brazil,
Chile, Paraguay, Peru and other countries in South America; and the
Association of Cosmopolitan Clubs in North America. Thus, at present,
the sole United States constituent is the Association of Cosmopolitan
Clubs. It was recommended that the Intercollegiate Menorah Association
accept the invitation to join Corda Fratres as a unit co-ordinate with
the Association of Cosmopolitan Clubs, it being understood that the
Menorah Association, while thus expressing its approval of the
purposes and spirit of Corda Fratres and desiring to aid in its
influence and to contribute the element of Jewish culture and ideals
to its spiritual constituency, would not be qualified in any way as to
its autonomy, purposes, and activities.

During the past year the Association continued its lecture system, and
genuine thanks are due to all the speakers, members of the Menorah
College of Lecturers, who have so generously given of their time and
effort to the Menorah Societies.

Similarly, the Association has been enabled to continue sending
Menorah Libraries to its constituent Societies. In most cases these
books have been placed at the disposal of all the members of the
university no less than of the members of the Menorah Societies, and
the authorities have expressed their warmest gratitude for these
contributions to their library facilities, even though the books
remained the property of the Jewish Publication Society of America.

The presence of the books has done a great deal to stimulate actual
reading and study on the part of Menorah members, and the work of the
study groups has notably increased during the past year. This is a
most gratifying evidence of the seriousness with which the students
are taking hold of the Menorah idea. They are still hampered by lack
of suitable syllabi, the preparation of which has been unfortunately
delayed on account of the impaired health of the scholar who had
undertaken to prepare them, but it was hoped that the syllabi would be
made available before long.

The chief visible product of the administration the past year was the
180-page booklet entitled "The Menorah Movement," which contains a
full and official exposition of the nature and purposes of the Menorah
movement, a detailed history of the several Societies as well as of
the Intercollegiate organization, including reports of the conferences
and conventions, besides other material illustrating the attitude of
the university authorities and the general community towards the
Menorah movement. Its preparation took several months of labor on the
part of the Officers of the Association (special credit being due to
the Secretary, Mr. Isador Becker), assisted by the various Societies.
An edition of five thousand, of which only a comparatively small
number of copies remain, was distributed all over the country among
the members of the Societies, other students, university authorities,
alumni, and the interested public. It served to arouse both the
academic and lay interest in the movement and to spread[137] authoritative
information about the nature and purposes of the Menorah Societies.

This publication also prepared the way for the issue of the permanent
and periodical Journal of the Menorah Association, the desirability of
which has been felt almost from the beginning of the Intercollegiate
organization and reaffirmed at the last Convention. It had been hoped
that the first number of The Menorah Journal would appear in time for
this Convention, but the demands of an initial number that should in
every way be worthy of the Menorah ideal of the Journal required a
little more time, and the first issue could not appear before January,
1915.

The Menorah Journal, it was hoped, would not only spread interesting
and authoritative information about the activities of the Menorah
Societies and stimulate their work further in the future, but would
itself be a potent means of promoting Jewish knowledge and literature.
The Journal was meant to appeal not to Menorah members alone nor to
students only, but to all within and without the universities who were
interested in the literary treatment of Jewish life and aspiration.
The Journal was extremely fortunate in having the counsel and literary
co-operation of many leaders of Jewish thought and action of all
parties (for list of Consulting Editors see Contents Page), the
Journal itself, like the Menorah Societies, being non-partisan, a
forum for the free expression of variant views.

Upon the success of the Journal will largely depend the future
progress of the Menorah movement and its other literary enterprises
contemplated, e. g., pamphlet essays and Menorah Classics, which for
the present should be postponed, all energies having to be devoted to
the Journal.

The gratifying encouragement given to the Journal enterprise by many
men in the community is but a specific application of the co-operation
of the Graduate Menorah Committee, headed by Justice Irving Lehman,
which has continued during the past year to assist the Association
generously and in the most admirable spirit, the committee reposing
absolutely perfect confidence in the officers of the Association. To
that co-operation and spirit of confidence the Association owes a
great deal which it can repay only by continued effective devotion to
the cause which is equally dear to the students and the graduates. It
was deemed advisable that for the present the Graduate Menorah
Committee should continue as an informal body.

A gratifying evidence of the mutual co-operation of the Menorah
Societies in a material way during the past year was shown in the
appropriation of fifty dollars by the Harvard Menorah Society for the
Association.

All in all, the Association during the past year may be said to have
advanced satisfactorily, though the Officers are conscious of the
great opportunities which still remain before the organization.
Indeed, the Menorah work is still in its beginnings. With the loyal
co-operation of the students and the graduates, the Association looks
forward confidently to a bright and big future.


Resolutions

After due consideration and discussion, the following resolutions were
unanimously adopted:

Resolved, That the Intercollegiate Menorah Association, organized for
the promotion in American Colleges and Universities of the study of
Jewish history, culture and problems, and the advancement of Jewish
ideals, affiliate with the "Corda Fratres" International Federation of
Students. Note: This resolution was adopted upon the conditions (1)
that the Intercollegiate Menorah Association be received into the
International Federation of Students as a unit co-ordinate with the
Association of Cosmopolitan Clubs, and (2) that the autonomy, purposes
and activities of the Intercollegiate Menorah Association shall nowise
be qualified by such affiliation.[H]

Resolved, That the fifty dollars contributed by the Harvard Menorah
Society to the Intercollegiate Menorah Association be devoted to The
Menorah Journal.[138]

Resolved, That the Officers be constituted a committee to investigate
the nature and work of student organizations analogous to the Menorah
in other parts of the world and to submit a report thereon at the next
Intercollegiate Menorah Convention. (Readopted from the last
Convention.)

Resolved, That the Officers be constituted a committee to consider
and draw up definite plans for "Menorah insignia and distinctions."


Third Session

The third session was a public meeting held at 8.15 P.M. in McMicken
Auditorium, University of Cincinnati. (For report see page 121.)

Called to order on Thursday, December 24th, at 9.15 A.M., in the
Faculty Room, McMicken Hall, by President Sharfman.

After due consideration and discussion the following resolutions were
unanimously adopted:

Resolved, That the incoming Officers investigate the problem of the
organization of Graduate Menorah Societies and prepare a report with
recommendations for submission to the constituent Societies at the
beginning of the next academic year(1915-16).

The Administrative Council, in session assembled, hereby expresses
its hearty approval of the relationship that has arisen and has been
maintained between the Intercollegiate Menorah Association, through
its Officers, and a body of representative Jewish citizens of public
spirit, known as a Graduate Advisory Committee, and gratefully records
its deep appreciation of the wise counsel and generous assistance of
this Graduate Advisory Committee in the prosecution of the Menorah
purposes, and

Resolves, First, that these informal relations between the
Intercollegiate Menorah Association and the Graduate Advisory
Committee be permitted to continue as heretofore, and second, that
the incoming Officers of the Association present plans looking to the
permanent organization of this Graduate Advisory Committee, at the
next mid-winter meeting of the Administrative Council. (Readopted
from the last Convention.)

The Intercollegiate Menorah Convention extends its cordial greetings
to Justice Irving Lehman and acknowledges with warm appreciation his
welcome message and his generous assurance of willing co-operation.
The Association is encouraged to carry forward with renewed vigor and
inspiration its work of promoting the study of Jewish history and
culture at American Colleges and Universities and of advancing Jewish
ideals; to merit the confidence and support of the Graduate Advisory
Committee.

Resolved, That each constituent Menorah Society should be bound to
seek the advice and consent of the Officers of the Association before
soliciting assistance from any source. (Readopted from the last
Convention.)

Resolved, That the Administrative Council of the Intercollegiate
Menorah Association, in annual meeting assembled, hereby
enthusiastically expresses its entire confidence and trust in the work
done by the Officers of the Intercollegiate Menorah Association and
its appreciation of the able and efficient manner in which they
conducted and supervised the work of the organization during the past
year.

The oral reports of the several Menorah Societies, in amplification of
their written reports, were presented and discussed.


Fifth Session

The fifth session was an informal luncheon held in the Banquet Hall of
the Hotel Gibson, Cincinnati, at 1 P.M. (For a report of the
addresses, see page 125.)


Sixth Session

Immediately following the luncheon, at 4 P.M., the sixth session was
convened in the private auditorium of the Hotel Gibson.

The following resolution was unanimously adopted:[139]

Resolved, That the Officers of the Association take steps to provide
Menorah Societies with syllabi of courses in Jewish history, Jewish
literature, and contemporaneous Jewish problems. (Readopted from the
last Convention.)

Upon proceeding to the choice of Officers of the Association for 1915,
the following were elected: Chancellor, Henry Hurwitz of Boston, Mass.
(re-elected by acclamation); President, I. Leo Sharfman of the
University of Michigan (re-elected by acclamation); First
Vice-President, Isadore Levin, of Harvard University; Second
Vice-President, Milton D. Sapiro of the University of California;
Third Vice-President, Abraham J. Feldman of the University of
Cincinnati; Treasurer, N. Morais Lyon of the University of Cincinnati;
and Secretary, Charles K. Feinberg of New York University.

After some discussion as to the advisability of deciding immediately
upon the place of the next Annual Convention, it was

Resolved, That the place of meeting for the next Annual Convention be
left to the judgment of the Officers of the Association.

After passing unanimously a Resolution thanking the University of
Cincinnati, the Hebrew Union College, the Cincinnati Menorah Society,
and the city of Cincinnati for the cordial reception accorded to the
Convention, adjournment was had at 5.45 P.M.

Notes

Of the Intercollegiate Menorah Association


Brown Menorah Dedication Exercises

The Brown Menorah Society held its dedication exercises in the
auditorium of the Brown Union on January 16, 1915. The Chairman was
Maurice J. Siff, '15, President of the Society. Morris J. Wessel, '11,
spoke of the need of the Menorah from the graduate's point of view.
Chancellor Henry Hurwitz brought the greetings of the Intercollegiate
Menorah Association and explained the purposes of the Menorah
movement. President W. H. P. Faunce of the University, in his
response, welcomed the Menorah Society to Brown. Rabbi Nathan Stern,
of Providence, spoke upon the significance of the Menorah, and
unveiled and lit a brass Menorah which he presented to the Society.
Dean Otis E. Randall spoke upon "The Educational Value of College
Organizations," and expressed the hope that the new Menorah Society
would contribute to the uplift of the student body.

President Faunce said, in part: "This Society must justify itself by
making better Brown men than ever before. Most especially among its
duties it must strive for a type of Brown man that cultivates the best
there is in himself, a man who respects himself, soul, body and
spirit, the type of man who flings himself gladly into whatever he
believes in. And so I hope to-night that every member of this Society
will cherish the finest things in the history of his own people if he
is a member of the Jewish nation       that he will cultivate everything
that is worthy and noble and try to help his brethren throughout the
world."


The Thirty-Sixth Menorah Society

A Menorah Society has recently been organized at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, in Boston. The meeting preliminary to
definite organization was held in the Technology Union on March 9.
Isadore Levin of the Harvard Menorah Society, First Vice-President of
the Intercollegiate Menorah Association, brought the greetings of the
Association and explained the Menorah purposes and procedure. Leo I.
Dana, '16, was elected President.

In a communication to the Chancellor of the Menorah Association, Dean
Alfred E. Burton of the Institute writes: "I take pleasure in stating
that we shall be glad to have a branch of the Menorah Society formed
among our undergraduates, and I can endorse the names of the officers
who have been chosen. They are all earnest students in good standing
at the Institute and I am sure they will be able to establish a branch
of the Menorah Society that will be a credit to the general
intercollegiate organization."

The first lecture before the Society was delivered on April 5 by Dr.
H. M. Kallen of the University of Wisconsin. The subject was "Hebraism
and Nationality."
