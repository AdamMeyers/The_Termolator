<br>
DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE ORIGIN AND PROGRESS OF INGUINAL HERNIAE IN
GENERAL.<br>
<br>
PLATE 41, Fig. 1.--When the serous spermatic tube is obliterated for its<br>
whole length between the internal ring, 1, and the top of the testicle,<br>
13, a hernia, in order to enter the inguinal canal, 1, 4, must either<br>
rupture the peritonaeum at the point 1, or dilate this membrane before<br>
it in the form of a sac. [Footnote] If the peritonaeum at the point 1 be<br>
ruptured by the intestine, this latter will enter the fibrous spermatic<br>
tube, 2, 3, and will pass along this tube devoid of the serous sac. If,<br>
on the other hand, the intestine dilates the serous membrane at the<br>
point, 1, where it stretches across the internal ring, it will, on<br>
entering the fibrous tube, (infundibuliform fascia,) be found invested<br>
by a sac of the peritonaeum, which it dilates and pouches before itself.<br>
As the epigastric artery, 9, bends in general along the internal border<br>
of the ring of the fibrous tube, 2, 2, the neck of the hernial sac which<br>
enters the ring at a point external to the artery must be external to<br>
it, and remain so despite all further changes in the form, position, and<br>
dimensions of the hernia. And as this hernia enters the ring at a point<br>
anterior to the spermatic vessels, its neck must be anterior to them.<br>
Again, if the bowel be invested by a serous sac, formed of the<br>
peritonaeum at the point 1, the neck of such sac must intervene between<br>
the protruding bowel and the epigastric and spermatic vessels. But if<br>
the intestine enter the ring of the fibrous tube, 2, 2, by having<br>
ruptured the peritonaeum at the point 1, then the naked intestine will<br>
lie in immediate contact with these vessels.<br>
<br>
[Footnote: Mr. Lawrence (op. cit.) remarks, "When we consider the<br>
texture of the peritonaeum, and the mode of its connexion to the<br>
abdominal parietes, we cannot fancy the possibility of tearing the<br>
membrane by any attitude or motion." Cloquet and Scarpa have also<br>
expressed themselves to the effect, that the peritonaeum suffers a<br>
gradual distention before the protruding bowel.]<br>

Plate 41--Figure 1<br>
<br>
<br>
PLATE 41, Fig. 2--When the serous spermatic tube, 11, remains pervious<br>
between the internal ring, 1, (where it communicates with the general<br>
peritonaeal membrane,) and the top of the testicle, (where it opens into<br>
the tunica vaginalis,) the bowel enters this tube directly, without a<br>
rupture of the peritonaeum at the point 1. This tube, therefore, becomes<br>
one of the investments of the bowel. It is the serous sac, not formed by<br>
the protruding bowel, but one already open to receive the bowel. This is<br>
the condition necessary to the formation of congenital hernia. This<br>
hernia must be one of the external oblique variety, because it enters<br>
the open abdominal end of the infantile serous spermatic tube, which is<br>
always external to the epigastric artery. Its position in regard to the<br>
spermatic vessels is the same as that noticed in Fig, 1, Plate 41. But,<br>
as the serous tube through which the congenital hernia descends, still<br>
communicates with the tunica vaginalis, so will this form of hernia<br>
enter this tunic, and thereby become different to all other herniae,<br>
forasmuch as it will lie in immediate contact with the testicle.<br>
[Footnote]<br>
<br>
[Footnote: A hernia may be truly congenital, and yet the intestine may<br>
not enter the tunica vaginalis. Thus, if the serous spermatic tube close<br>
only at the top of the testicle, the bowel which traverses the open<br>
internal inguinal ring and pervious tube will not enter the tunica<br>
vaginalis.]<br>
<br>
<br>

Plate 41--Figure 2<br>
<br>
<br>
PLATE 41, Fig. 3.--The infantile serous spermatic tube, 11, sometimes<br>
remains pervious in the neighbourhood of the internal ring, 1, and a<br>
narrow tapering process of the tube (the canal of Nuck) descends within<br>
the fibrous tube, 2, 3, and lies in front of the spermatic vessels and<br>
epigastric artery. Before this tube reaches the testicle, it degenerates<br>
into a mere filament, and thus the tunica vaginalis has become separated<br>
from it as a distinct sac. When the bowel enters the open abdominal end<br>
of the serous tube, this latter becomes the hernial sac. It is not<br>
possible to distinguish by any special character a hernia of this<br>
nature, when already formed, from one which occurs in the condition of<br>
parts proper to Fig. 1, Plate 41, or that which is described in the note<br>
to Fig. 2, Plate 41; for when the intestine dilates the tube, 11, into<br>
the form of a sac, this latter assumes the exact shape of the sac, as<br>
noticed in Fig. 1, Plate 41. The hernia in question cannot enter the<br>
tunica vaginalis. Its position in regard to the epigastric and spermatic<br>
vessels is the same as that mentioned above.<br>
<br>
<br>

Plate 41--Figure 3<br>
<br>
<br>
PLATE 41, Fig. 4.--If the serous spermatic tube, 11, be obliterated or<br>
closed at the internal ring, 1, thus cutting off communication with the<br>
general peritonaeal membrane; and if, at the same time, it remain<br>
pervious from this point above to the tunica vaginalis below, then the<br>
herniary bowel, when about to protrude at the point 1, must force and<br>
dilate the peritonaeum, in order to form its sac anew, as stated of Fig.<br>
1, Plate 41. Such a hernia does not enter either the serous tube or the<br>
tunica vaginalis; but progresses from the point 1, in a distinct sac. In<br>
this case, there will be found two sacs--one enclosing the bowel; and<br>
another, consisting of the serous spermatic tube, still continuous with<br>
the tunica vaginalis. This original state of the parts may, however,<br>
suffer modification in two modes: 1st, if the bowel rupture the<br>
peritonaeum at the point 1, it will enter the serous tube 11, and<br>
descend through this into the cavity of the tunica vaginalis, as in the<br>
congenital variety. 2nd, if the bowel rupture the peritonaeum near the<br>
point 1, and does not enter the serous tube 11, nor the tunica<br>
vaginalis, then the bowel will be found devoid of a proper serous sac,<br>
while the serous tube and tunica vaginalis still exist in communication.<br>
In either case, the hernia will hold the same relative position in<br>
regard to the epigastric artery and spermatic vessels, as stated of Fig.<br>
1, Plate 41.<br>
<br>

Plate 41--Figure 4<br>
<br>
PLATE 41, Fig. 5.--Sudden rupture of the peritonaeum at the closed<br>
internal serous ring, 1, though certainly not impossible, may yet be<br>
stated as the exception to the rule in the formation of an external<br>
inguinal hernia. The aphorism, "natura non facit saltus," is here<br>
applicable. When the peritonaeum suffers dilatation at the internal<br>
ring, 1, it advances <span style="font-style: italic;">gradatim</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">pari passu</span> with the
progress of the<br>
protruding bowel, and assumes the form, character, position, and<br>
dimensions of the inverted curved phases, marked 11, 11, till, from<br>
having at first been a very shallow pouch, lying external to the<br>
epigastric artery, 9, it advances through the inguinal canal to the<br>
external ring, 4, and ultimately traverses this aperture, taking the<br>
course of the fibrous tube, 3, down to the testicle in the scrotum.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a href="images/094P41F5_25.jpg"><img alt=""

 style="border: 2px solid ; width: 557px; height: 657px;"></a><br>
Plate 41--Figure 5<br>
<br>
<br>
PLATE 41, Fig. 6.--When the bowel dilates the peritonaeum opposite the<br>
internal ring, and carries a production of this membrane before it as<br>
its sac, then the hernia will occupy the inguinal canal, and become<br>
invested by all those structures which form the canal. These structures<br>
are severally infundibuliform processes, so fashioned by the original<br>
descent of the testicle; and, therefore, as the bowel follows the track<br>
of the testicle, it becomes, of course, invested by the selfsame parts<br>
in the selfsame manner. Thus, as the infundibuliform fascia, 2, 3,<br>
contains the hernia and spermatic vessels, so does the cremaster muscle,<br>
extending from the lower margins of the internal oblique and<br>
transversalis, invest them also in an infundibuliform manner. [Footnote]<br>
<br>
<br>
[Footnote: Much difference of opinion prevails as to the true relation<br>
which the cord (and consequently the oblique hernia) bears to the lower<br>
margins of the oblique and transverse muscles, and their cremasteric<br>
prolongation. Mr. Guthrie (Inguinal and Femoral Hernia) has shown that<br>
the fibres of the transversalis, as well as those of the internal<br>
oblique, are penetrated by the cord. Albinus, Haller, Cloquet, Camper,<br>
and Scarpa, record opinions from which it may be gathered that this<br>
disposition of the parts is (with some exceptions) general. Sir Astley<br>
Cooper describes the lower edge of the transversalis as curved all round<br>
the internal ring and cord. From my own observations, coupled with<br>
these, I am inclined to the belief that, instead of viewing these facts<br>
as isolated and meaningless particulars, we should now fuse them into<br>
the one idea expressed by the philosophic Carus, and adopted by Cloquet,<br>
that the cremaster is a production of the abdominal muscles, formed<br>
mechanically by the testicle, which in its descent dilates, penetrates,<br>
and elongates their fibres.]<br>

Plate 41--Figure 6<br>
<br>
<br>
PLATE 41. Fig. 7.--When an external inguinal hernia, 11, dilates and<br>
protrudes the peritonaeum from the closed internal ring, 1, and descends<br>
the inguinal canal and fibrous tube, 3, 3, it imitates, in most<br>
respects, the original descent of the testicle. The difference between<br>
both descents attaches alone to the mode in which they become covered by<br>
the serous membrane; for the testicle passes through the internal ring<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">behind</span> the inguinal
peritonaeum, at the same time that it takes a<br>
duplicature of this membrane; whereas the bowel encounters this part of<br>
the peritonaeum <span style="font-style: italic;">from within</span>,
and in this mode becomes invested by it on<br>
all sides. This figure also represents the form and relative position of<br>
a hernia, as occurring in Figs. 1 and 3, 5, and 6, Plate 41.<br>
<br>
<br>

Plate 41--Figure 7<br>
<br>
<br>
PLATE 41, Fig. 8.--When the serous spermatic tube only closes at the<br>
internal ring, as seen at 1, Fig. 4, Plate 41, if a hernia afterwards<br>
pouch the peritonaeum at this part, and enter the inguinal canal, we<br>
shall then have the form of hernia, Fig. 8, Plate 41, termed infantile.<br>
Two serous sacs will be here found, one within the cord, 13, and<br>
communicating with the tunica vaginalis, the other, 11, containing the<br>
bowel, and being received by inversion into the upper extremity of the<br>
first. Thus the infantile serous canal, 13, receives the hernial sac,<br>
11. The inguinal canal and cord may become multicapsular, as in Fig. 8,<br>
from various causes, each capsule being a distinct serous membrane.<br>
First, independent of hernial formation, the original serous tube may<br>
become interruptedly obliterated, as in Plate 40, Fig. 2. Secondly,<br>
these sacs may persist to adult age, and have a hernial sac added to<br>
their number, whatever this may be. Thirdly, the original serous tube,<br>
13, Fig. 8, may persist, and after having received the hernial sac, 11,<br>
the bowel may have been reduced, leaving its sac behind it in the<br>
inguinal canal; the neck of this sac may have been obliterated by the<br>
pressure of a truss, a second hernia may protrude at the point 1, and<br>
this may be received into the first hernial sac in the same manner as<br>
the first was received into the original serous infantile tube. The<br>
possibility of these occurrences is self-evident, even if they were<br>
never as yet experienced. [Footnote]<br>
<br>
[Footnote: According to Mr. Lawrence and M. Cloquet, most of the serous<br>
cysts found around hernial tumours are ancient sacs obliterated at the<br>
neck, and adhering to the new swelling (opera cit.)]<br>

Plate 41--Figure 8<br>
<br>
<br>
PLATE 42, Fig. 1.--The epigastric artery, 9, being covered by the fascia<br>
transversalis, can lend no support to the internal ring, 2, 2, nor to<br>
the tube prolonged from it. The herniary bowel may, therefore, dilate<br>
the peritonaeum immediately on the inner side of the artery, and enter<br>
the inguinal canal. In this way the hernia, 11, although situated<br>
internal to the epigastric artery, assumes an oblique course through the<br>
canal, and thus closely simulates the external variety of inguinal<br>
hernia, Fig. 7, Plate 41. If the hernia enter the canal, as represented<br>
in Fig. 1, Plate 42, it becomes invested by the same structures, and<br>
assumes the same position in respect to the spermatic vessels, as the<br>
external hernia.<br>
<br>
<br>

Plate 42--Figure 1<br>
<br>
<br>
PLATE 42, Fig. 2.--The hernial sac, 11, which entered the ring of the<br>
fibrous tube, 2, 2, at a point immediately internal to the epigastric<br>
artery, 9, may, from having been at first oblique, as in Fig. 1, Plate<br>
42, assume a direct position. In this case, the ring of the fibrous<br>
tube, 2, 2, will be much widened; but the artery and spermatic vessels<br>
will remain in their normal position, being in no wise affected by the<br>
gravitating hernia. If the conjoined tendon, 6, be so weak as not to<br>
resist the gravitating force of the hernia, the tendon will become bent<br>
upon itself. If the umbilical cord, 10, be side by side with the<br>
epigastric artery at the time that the hernia enters the mouth of the<br>
fibrous tube, then, of course, the cord will be found external. If the<br>
cord lie towards the pubes, apart from the vessel, the hernia may enter<br>
the fibrous tube between the cord, 10, and artery, 9. [Footnote:] It is<br>
impossible for any internal hernia to assume the congenital form,<br>
because the neck of the original serous spermatic tube, 11, Fig. 2,<br>
Plate 41, being external to the epigastric artery, 9, cannot be entered<br>
by the hernia, which originates internally to this vessel.<br>
<br>
[Footnote: M. Cloquet states that the umbilical cord is always found on<br>
the inner side of the external hernia. Its position varies in respect to<br>
the internal hernia, (op. cit. prop. 52.)]<br>
<br>
<br>

Plate 42--Figure 2<br>
<br>
<br>
PLATE 42, Fig. 3.--Every internal hernia, which does not rupture the<br>
peritonaeum, carries forward a sac produced anew from this membrane,<br>
whether the hernia enter the inguinal canal or not. But this is not the<br>
case with respect to the fibrous membrane which forms the fascia<br>
propria. If the hernia enter the inguinal wall immediately on the inner<br>
side of the epigastric artery, Fig. 1, Plate 42, it passes direct into<br>
the ring of the fibrous tube, 2, 2, already prepared to receive it. But<br>
when the hernia, 11, Fig. 3, Plate 42, cleaves the conjoined tendon, 6,<br>
6, then the artery, 9, and the tube, 2, 2, remain in their usual<br>
position, while the bowel carries forward a new investment from the<br>
transversalis fascia, 5, 5. That part of the conjoined tendon which<br>
stands external to the hernia keeps the tube, 2, 2, in its proper place,<br>
and separates it from the fold of the fascia which invests the hernial<br>
sac. This is the only form in which an internal hernia can be said to be<br>
absolutely distinct from the inguinal canal and spermatic vessels. This<br>
hernia, when passing the external ring, 4, has the spermatic cord on its<br>
outer side.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a href="images/094P42F3_25.jpg"><img alt=""

 style="border: 2px solid ; width: 455px; height: 691px;"></a><br>
Plate 42--Figure 3<br>
<br>
<br>
PLATE 42, Fig. 4.--The external hernia, from having been originally<br>
oblique, may assume the position of a hernia originally internal and<br>
direct. The change of place exhibited by this form of hernia does not<br>
imply a change either in its original investments or in its position<br>
with respect to the epigastric artery and spermatic vessels. The change<br>
is merely caused by the weight and gravitation of the hernial mass,<br>
which bends the epigastric artery, 9*, from its first position on the<br>
inner margin of the internal ring, 1, till it assumes the place 9. In<br>
consequence of this, the internal ring of the fascia transversalis, 2,<br>
2, is considerably widened, as it is also in Fig. 2, Plate 42. It is the<br>
inner margin of the fibrous ring which has suffered the pressure; and<br>
thus the hernia now projects directly from behind forwards, through, 4,<br>
the external ring. The conjoined tendon, 6, when weak, becomes bent upon<br>
itself. The change of place performed by the gravitating hernia may<br>
disturb the order and relative position of the spermatic vessels; but<br>
these, as well as the hernia, still occupy the inguinal canal, and are<br>
invested by the spermatic fascia, 3, 3. When an internal hernia, Fig. 1,<br>
Plate 42, enters the inguinal canal, it also may descend the cord as far<br>
as the testicle, and assume in respect to this gland the same position<br>
as the external hernia. [Footnote]<br>
<br>
[Footnote: As the external hernia, Fig. 4, Plate 42, may displace the<br>
epigastric artery inwards, so may the internal hernia, Fig. 1, Plate 42,<br>
displace the artery outwards. Mr. Lawrence, Sir Astley Cooper, Scarpa,<br>
Hesselbach, and Langenbeck, state, however, that the internal hernia<br>
does not disturb the artery from its usual position three-fourths of an<br>
inch from the external ring.]<br>
<br>

Plate 42--Figure 4<br>
<br>
<br>
PLATE 42, Figs. 5, 6, 7.--The form and position of the inguinal canal<br>
varies according to the sex and age of the individual. In early life,<br>
Fig. 6, the internal ring is situated nearly opposite to the external<br>
ring, 4. As the pelvis widens gradually in the advance to adult age,<br>
Fig. 5, the canal becomes oblique as to position. This obliquity is<br>
caused by a change of place, performed rather by the internal than the<br>
external ring. [Footnote] The greater width of the female pelvis than of<br>
the male, renders the canal more oblique in the former; and this,<br>
combined with the circumstance that the female inguinal canal, Fig. 7,<br>
merely transmits the round ligament, 14, accounts anatomically for the<br>
fact, that this sex is less liable to the occurrence of rupture in this<br>
situation.<br>
<br>
[Footnote: M. Velpeau (Nouveaux Elemens de med. Operat.) states the<br>
length of the inguinal canal in a well-formed adult, measured from the<br>
internal to the external ring, to be 1-1/2 or 2 inches, and 3 inches<br>
including the rings; but that in some individuals the rings are placed<br>
nearly opposite; whilst in young subjects the two rings nearly always<br>
correspond. When, in company with these facts, we recollect how much the<br>
parts are liable to be disturbed in ruptures, it must be evident that<br>
their relative position cannot be exactly ascertained by measurement,<br>
from any given point whatever. The judgment alone must fix the general<br>
average.]<br>
