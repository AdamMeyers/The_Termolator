PREFACE


The object of this little book is not to describe how to
construct some particular kind of aeroplane; this has been
done elsewhere: but to narrate in plain language the
general practice and principles of model aeroplaning.

There is a science of model aeroplaning&mdash;just as there is
a science of model yachting and model steam and electric
traction, and an endeavour is made in the following pages
to do in some measure for model aeroplanes what has
already been done for model yachts and locomotives. To
achieve the best results, theory and practice must go hand
in hand.

From a series of carefully conducted experiments empirical
formulæ can be obtained which, combined later with
mathematical induction and deduction, may lead, not only
to a more accurate and generalized law than that contained
in the empirical formula, but to valuable deductions of a
totally new type, embodying some general law hitherto
quite unknown by experimentalists, which in its turn may
serve as a foundation or stepping stone for suggesting other
experiments and empirical formulæ which may be of especial
importance, to be treated in their turn like their predecessor.
By "especial importance," I mean not only to "model," but
"Aeroplaning" generally.

As to the value of experiments on or with models with
respect to full-sized machines, fifteen years ago I held the
opinion that they were a very doubtful factor. I have since
considerably modified that view, and now consider that experiments
with models&mdash;if properly carried out, and given[vi]
due, not undue, weight&mdash;both can and will be of as much
use to the science of Aeronautics as they have already proved
themselves to be in that of marine engineering.

The subject of model propellers and motors has been
somewhat fully dealt with, as but little has been published
(in book form, at any rate) on these all-important departments.
On similar grounds the reasons why and how a
model aeroplane flies have been practically omitted, because
these have been dealt with more or less in every book on
heavier-than-air machines.

Great care has been exercised in the selection of matter,
and in the various facts stated herein; in most cases I have
personally verified them; great pains have also been exercised
to exclude not only misleading, but also doubtful
matter. I have no personal axe to grind whatever, nor am
I connected either directly or indirectly with any firm of
aeroplane builders, model or otherwise.

The statements contained in these pages are absolutely
free from bias of any kind, and for them I am prepared to
accept full responsibility.

I have to thank Messrs. A.W. Gamage (Holborn) for
the use of various model parts for testing purposes, and
also for the use of various electros from their modern
Aviation Catalogue; also Messrs. T.W.K. Clarke &amp; Co., of
Kingston-on-Thames. For the further use of electros, and
for permission to reproduce illustrations which have previously
appeared in their papers, I must express my acknowledgment
and thanks to the publishers of the "Model
Engineer," "Flight," and the "Aero." Corrections and
suggestions of any kind will be gratefully received, and
duly acknowledged.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED IN
MODEL AEROPLANING.


Aeroplane. A motor-driven flying machine which relies upon
surfaces for its support in the air.

Monoplane (single). An aeroplane with one pair of outstretched
wings.

Aerofoil. These outstretched wings are often called aerofoil
surfaces. One pair of wings forming one aerofoil surface.

Monoplane (double). An aeroplane with two aerofoils, one behind
the other or two main planes, tandem-wise.

Biplane. An aeroplane with two aerofoils, one below the other,
or having two main planes superposed.

Triplane. An aeroplane having three such aerofoils or three
such main planes.

Multiplane. Any such machine having more than three of the
above.

Glider. A motorless aeroplane.

Helicopter. A flying machine in which propellers are employed
to raise the machine in the air by their own unaided efforts.

Dihedral Angle. A dihedral angle is an angle made by two
surfaces that do not lie in the same plane, i.e. when the aerofoils are
arranged V-shaped. It is better, however, to somewhat extend this
definition, and not to consider it as necessary that the two surfaces
do actually meet, but would do so if produced thus in figure. BA
and CD are still dihedrals, sometimes termed "upturned tips."



Dihedrals.


Span is the distance from tip to tip of the main supporting
surface measured transversely (across) the line of flight.

Camber (a slight arching or convexity upwards). This term
denotes that the aerofoil has such a curved transverse section.[xiv]

Chord is the distance between the entering (or leading) edge of
the main supporting surface (aerofoil) and the trailing edge of the
same; also defined as the fore and aft dimension of the main planes
measured in a straight line between the leading and trailing edges.


Aspect Ratio is  span/chord


Gap is the vertical distance between one aerofoil and the one
which is immediately above it.

(The gap is usually made equal to the chord).

Angle of Incidence. The angle of incidence is the angle made
by the chord with the line of flight.





AB = chord.AB = cambered surface.
SP = line of flight.ASP = &#945; = L of incidence.



Width. The width of an aerofoil is the distance from the front
to the rear edge, allowing for camber.

Length. This term is usually applied to the machine as a whole,
from the front leading edge of elevator (or supports) to tip of tail.

Arched. This term is usually applied to aerofoil surfaces which
dip downwards like the wings of a bird. The curve in this case
being at right angles to "camber." A surface can, of course, be
both cambered and arched.

Propeller. A device for propelling or pushing an aeroplane
forward or for raising it vertically (lifting screw).

Tractor Screw. A device for pulling the machine (used when the
propeller is placed in the front of the machine).

Keel. A vertical plane or planes (usually termed "fins") arranged
longitudinally for the purposes of stability and steering.

Tail. The plane, or group of planes, at the rear end of an
aeroplane for the purpose chiefly of giving longitudinal stability.
In such cases the tail is normally (approx.) horizontal, but not
unfrequently vertical tail-pieces are fitted as well for steering
(transversely) to the right or left, or the entire tail may be twisted
for the purpose of transverse stability (vide Elevator). Such[xv]
appendages are being used less and less with the idea of giving
actual support.

Rudder is the term used for the vertical plane, or planes,
which are used to steer the aeroplane sideways.

Warping. The flexing or bending of an aerofoil out of its
normal shape. The rear edges near the tips of the aerofoil being
dipped or tilted respectively, in order to create a temporary difference
in their inclinations to the line of flight. Performed in conjunction
with rudder movements, to counteract the excessive action
of the latter.

Ailerons (also called "righting-tips," "balancing-planes," etc.).
Small aeroplanes in the vicinity of the tips of the main aerofoil for
the purpose of assisting in the maintenance of equilibrium or for
steering purposes either with or without the assistance of the
rudder.

Elevator. The plane, or planes, in front of the main aerofoil
used for the purpose of keeping the aeroplane on an even keel, or
which cause (by being tilted or dipped) the aeroplane to rise or fall
(vide Tail).





MODEL AEROPLANING






INTRODUCTION.


§ 1. Model Aeroplanes are primarily divided into two
classes: first, models intended before all else to be ones that
shall fly; secondly, models, using the word in its proper sense
of full-sized machines. Herein model aeroplanes differ from
model yachts and model locomotives. An extremely small
model locomotive built to scale will still work, just as a very
small yacht built to scale will sail; but when you try to
build a scale model of an "Antoinette" monoplane, including
engine, it cannot be made to fly unless the scale be a
very large one. If, for instance, you endeavoured to make
a 1/10 scale model, your model petrol motor would be compelled
to have eight cylinders, each 0·52 bore, and your
magneto of such size as easily to pass through a ring half an
inch in diameter. Such a model could not possibly work.[1]

Note.&mdash;Readers will find in the "Model Engineer" of June 16,
1910, some really very fine working drawings of a prize-winning
Antoinette monoplane model.[2]

§ 2. Again, although the motor constitutes the chief, it
is by no means the sole difficulty in scale model aeroplane
building. To reproduce to scale at scale weight, or indeed
anything approaching it, all the necessary&mdash;in the case of a
full-sized machine&mdash;framework is not possible in a less than
1/5 scale.

§ 3. Special difficulties occur in the case of any prototype
taken. For instance, in the case of model Blériots it is
extremely difficult to get the centre of gravity sufficiently
forward.

§ 4. Scale models of actual flying machines that will fly
mean models at least 10 or 12 feet across, and every other
dimension in like proportion; and it must always be carefully
borne in mind that the smaller the scale the greater
the difficulties, but not in the same proportion&mdash;it would
not be twice as difficult to build a &frac14;-in. scale model as a
&frac12;-in., but four, five or six times as difficult.

§ 5. Now, the first requirement of a model aeroplane, or
flying machine, is that it shall FLY.

As will be seen later on&mdash;unless the machine be of large
size, 10 feet and more spread&mdash;the only motor at our
disposal is the motor of twisted rubber strands, and this to
be efficient requires to be long, and is of practically uniform
weight throughout; this alone alters the entire distribution
of weight on the machine and makes:

§ 6. "Model Aeroplaning an Art in itself," and
as such we propose to consider it in the following pages.

We have said that the first requisite of a model aeroplane
is that it shall fly, but there is no necessity, nor is it indeed
always to be desired, that this should be its only one, unless
it be built with the express purpose of obtaining a record
length of flight. For ordinary flights and scientific study
what is required is a machine in which minute detail is of[3]
secondary importance, but which does along its main lines
"approximate to the real thing."

§ 7. Simplicity should be the first thing aimed at&mdash;simplicity
means efficiency, it means it in full-sized machines,
still more does it mean it in models&mdash;and this very question
of simplicity brings us to that most important question of
all, namely, the question of weight.

appeared in the correspondence columns of "The Aero."[2]

"To give you some idea how slight a thing will make a
model behave badly, I fitted a skid to protect the propeller
underneath the aeroplane, and the result in retarding flight
could be seen very quickly, although the weight of the skid
was almost nil.[3] To all model makers who wish to make a
success I would say, strip all that useless and heavy chassis
off, cut down the 'good, honest stick' that you have for a
backbone to half its thickness, stay it with wire if it bends
under the strain of the rubber, put light silk on the planes,
and use an aluminium[4] propeller. The result will surpass
all expectations."

§ 2. The above refers, of course, to a rubber-motor
driven model. Let us turn to a steam-driven prototype. I
take the best known example of all, Professor Langley's
famous model. Here is what the professor has to say on
the question[5]:&mdash;

"Every bit of the machinery had to be constructed with
scientific accuracy. It had to be tested again and again.
The difficulty of getting the machine light enough was such[5]
that every part of it had to be remade several times. It would
be in full working order when something would give way,
and this part would have to be strengthened. This caused
additional weight, and necessitated cutting off so much
weight from some other part of the machinery. At times
the difficulty seemed almost heartbreaking; but I went on,
piece by piece and atom by atom, until I at last succeeded in
getting all the parts of the right strength and proportion."

How to obtain the maximum strength with the
minimum of weight is one of the, if not the most, difficult
problems which the student has to solve.

§ 3. The theoretical reason why weight is such an all-important
item in model aeroplaning, much more so than in
the case of full-size machines, is that, generally speaking,
such models do not fly fast enough to possess a high weight
carrying capacity. If you increase the area of the supporting
surface you increase also the resistance, and thereby
diminish the speed, and are no better off than before. The
only way to increase the weight carrying capacity of a
model is to increase its speed. This point will be recurred
to later on. One of Mr. T.W.K. Clarke's well-known
models, surface area 1&frac14; sq. ft., weight 1&frac14; lb., is stated to
have made a flight of 300 yards carrying 6 oz. of lead.
This works out approximately at 21 oz. per sq. ft.

The velocity (speed) is not stated, but some earlier
models by the same designer, weight 1&frac12; lb., supporting area
1&frac12; sq. ft., i.e., at rate of 16 oz. per sq. ft., travelled at a
rate of 37 ft. per second, or 25 miles an hour.

The velocity of the former, therefore, would certainly not
be less than 30 miles an hour.

§ 4. Generally speaking, however, models do not travel
at anything like this velocity, or carry anything like this
weight per sq. ft.[6]

An average assumption of 13 to 15 miles an hour does
nor err on the minimum side. Some very light fabric
covered models have a speed of less than even 10 miles an
hour. Such, of course, cannot be termed efficient models,
and carry only about 3 oz. per sq. ft. Between these two
types&mdash;these two extremes&mdash;somewhere lies the "Ideal
Model."

The maximum of strength with the minimum of weight
can be obtained only:&mdash;

1. By a knowledge of materials.

2. Of how to combine those materials in a most efficient
and skilful manner.

3. By a constant use of the balance or a pair of scales,
and noting (in writing) the weight and result of every
trial and every experiment in the alteration and change of
material used. Weigh everything.

§ 5. The reader must not be misled by what has been said,
and think that a model must not weigh anything if it is to
fly well. A heavy model will fly much better against the
wind than a light one, provided that the former will fly.
To do this it must fly fast. To do this again it must be
well powered, and offer the minimum of resistance to the
medium through which it moves. This means its aerofoil
(supporting) surfaces must be of polished wood or metal.
This point brings us to the question of Resistance, which
we will now consider.





[7]
CHAPTER II.

THE QUESTION OF RESISTANCE.


§ 1. It is, or should be, the function of an aeroplane&mdash;model
or otherwise&mdash;to pass through the medium in which
it travels in such a manner as to leave that medium in as
motionless a state as possible, since all motion of the surrounding
air represents so much power wasted.

Every part of the machine should be so constructed as
to move through the air with the minimum of disturbance
and resistance.

§ 2. The resistance, considered as a percentage of the
load itself, that has to be overcome in moving a load from
one place to another, is, according to Mr. F.W. Lanchester,
12&frac12; per cent. in the case of a flying machine, and 0·1 per
cent. in the case of a cargo boat, and of a solid tyre motor
car 3 per cent., a locomotive 1 per cent. Four times at
least the resistance in the case of aerial locomotion has to be
overcome to that obtained from ordinary locomotion on
land. The above refer, of course, to full-sized machines; for
a model the resistance is probably nearer 14 or 15 per cent.

§ 3. This resistance is made up of&mdash;

1. Aerodynamic resistance.
2. Head resistance.
3. Skin-friction (surface resistance).

The first results from the necessity of air supporting the
model during flight.[8]

The second is the resistance offered by the framework,
wires, edges of aerofoils, etc.

The third, skin-friction or surface resistance, is very
small at low velocities, but increases as the square of the
velocity. To reduce the resistance which it sets up, all
surfaces used should be as smooth as possible. To reduce
the second, contours of ichthyoid, or fish-like, form should
be used, so that the resultant stream-line flow of the
medium shall keep in touch with the surface of the
body.

§ 4. As long ago as 1894 a series of experiments were
made by the writer[6] to solve the following problem: given
a certain length and breadth, to find the shape which will
offer the least resistance. The experiments were made with
a whirling table 40 ft. in diameter, which could be rotated
so that the extremity of the arm rotated up to a speed of
45 miles an hour. The method of experimenting was as
follows: The bodies (diam. 4 in.) were balanced against one
another at the extremity of the arm, being so balanced that
their motions forward and backward were parallel. Provision
was made for accurately balancing the parallel scales on
which the bodies were suspended without altering the resistance
offered by the apparatus to the air. Two experiments
at least (to avoid error) were made in each case, the bodies
being reversed in the second experiment, the top one being
put at the bottom, and vice versa. The conclusions arrived
at were:&mdash;

For minimum (head) resistance a body should have&mdash;

1. Its greatest diameter two-fifths of its entire length
from its head.

2. Its breadth and its depth in the proportion of four to
three.[9]

3. Its length at least from five to nine times its greatest
breadth (nine being better than five).

4. A very tapering form of stern, the actual stern only
being of just sufficient size to allow of the propeller shaft
passing through. In the case of twin propellers some slight
modification of the stern would be necessary.

5. Every portion of the body in contact with the fluid
to be made as smooth as possible.

6. A body of such shape gives at most only one-twentieth
the resistance offered by a flat disk of similar maximum
sectional area.

Results since fully confirmed.



Fig. 1.&mdash;Shape of Least Resistance.


The design in Fig. 2 is interesting, not only because of
its probable origin, but because of the shape of the body
and arrangement of the propellers; no rudder is shown, and
the long steel vertical mast extending both upwards and
downwards through the centre would render it suitable only
for landing on water.

§ 5. In the case of a rubber-driven model, there is no
containing body part, so to speak, a long thin stick, or
tubular construction if preferred, being all that is necessary.

The long skein of elastic, vibrating as well as untwisting
as it travels with the machine through the air, offers some
appreciable resistance, and several experimenters have
enclosed it in a light tube made of very thin veneer wood
rolled and glued, or paper even may be used; such tubes[10]
can be made very light, and possess considerable rigidity,
especially longitudinally. If the model be a biplane, then
all the upright struts between the two aerofoils should be
given a shape, a vertical section of which is shown in Fig. 3.

§ 6. In considering this question of resistance, the
substance of which the aerofoil surface is made plays a very
important part, as well as whether that surface be plane or
curved. For some reason not altogether easy to determine,
fabric-covered planes offer considerably more resistance than
wooden or metal ones. That they should offer more resistance
is what common sense would lead one to expect, but
hardly to the extent met with in actual practice.



Fig. 2.&mdash;Design for an Aeroplane Model (Power Driven).
This design is attributed to Professor Langley.


Built up fabric-covered aeroplanes[7] gain in lightness, but
lose in resistance. In the case of curved surfaces this difference
is considerably more; one reason, undoubtedly, is that[11]
in a built up model surface there is nearly always a tendency
to make this curvature excessive, and much more than it
should be. Having called attention to this under the head
of resistance, we will leave it now to recur to it later when
considering the aerofoil proper.



Fig. 3.&mdash;Horizontal Section of Vertical Strut
(enlarged.)


§ 7. Allusion has been made in this chapter to skin
friction, but no value given for its coefficient.[8] Lanchester's
value for planes from &frac12; to l&frac12; sq. ft. in area, moving about
20 to 30 ft. per second, is


0·009 to 0·015.


Professor Zahm (Washington) gives 0·0026 lb. per
sq. ft. at 25 ft. per second, and at 37 ft. per second, 0·005,
and the formula



f = 0·00000778l&nbsp;·93v1·85


f being the average friction in lb. per sq. in., l the length in
feet, and v the velocity in ft. per second. He also experimented
with various kinds of surfaces, some rough, some
smooth, etc.

His conclusion is:&mdash;"All even surfaces have approximately
the same coefficient of skin friction. Uneven surfaces
have a greater coefficient." All formulæ on skin friction
must at present be accepted with reserve.[12]

§ 8. The following three experiments, however, clearly
prove its existence, and that it has considerable effect:&mdash;

1. A light, hollow celluloid ball, supported on a stream
of air projected upwards from a jet, rotates in one direction
or the other as the jet is inclined to the left or to the right.
(F.W. Lanchester.)

2. When a golf ball (which is rough) is hit so as to have
considerable underspin, its range is increased from 135 to
180 yards, due entirely to the greater frictional resistance
to the air on that side on which the whirl and the progressive
motion combine. (Prof. Tait.)

3. By means of a (weak) bow a golf ball can be made
to move point blank to a mark 30 yards off, provided the
string be so adjusted as to give a good underspin; adjust
the string to the centre of the ball, instead of catching it
below, and the drop will be about 8 ft. (Prof. Tait.)





[13]
CHAPTER III.

THE QUESTION OF BALANCE.


§ 1. It is perfectly obvious for successful flight that any
model flying machine (in the absence of a pilot) must
possess a high degree of automatic stability. The model
must be so constructed as to be naturally stable, in the
medium through which it is proposed to drive it. The last
remark is of the greatest importance, as we shall see.

§ 2. In connexion with this same question of automatic
stability, the question must be considered from the theoretical
as well as from the practical side, and the labours and
researches of such men as Professors Brian and Chatley,
F.W. Lanchester, Captain Ferber, Mouillard and others
must receive due weight. Their work cannot yet be fully
assessed, but already results have been arrived at far more
important than are generally supposed.

The following are a few of the results arrived at from
theoretical considerations; they cannot be too widely known.

(A) Surfaces concave on the under side are not stable
unless some form of balancing device (such as a tail, etc.)
is used.

(B) If an aeroplane is in equilibrium and moving uniformly,
it is necessary for stability that it shall tend towards
a condition of equilibrium.

(C) In the case of "oscillations" it is absolutely necessary
for stability that these oscillations shall decrease in
amplitude, in other words, be damped out.[14]

(D) In aeroplanes in which the dihedral angle is excessive
or the centre of gravity very low down, a dangerous
pitching motion is quite likely to be set up. [Analogy in
shipbuilding&mdash;an increase in the metacentre height while
increasing the stability in a statical sense causes the ship
to do the same.]

(E) The propeller shaft should pass through the centre
of gravity of the machine.

(F) The front planes should be at a greater angle of
inclination than the rear ones.

(G) The longitudinal stability of an aeroplane grows
much less when the aeroplane commences to rise, a monoplane
becoming unstable when the angle of ascent is greater
than the inclination of the main aerofoil to the horizon.

(H) Head resistance increases stability.

(I) Three planes are more stable than two. [Elevator&mdash;main
aerofoil&mdash;horizontal rudder behind.]

(J) When an aeroplane is gliding (downwards) stability
is greater than in horizontal flight.

(K) A large moment of inertia is inimical (opposed) to
stability.

(M) Aeroplanes (naturally) stable up to a certain velocity
(speed) may become unstable when moving beyond that
speed. [Possible explanation. The motion of the air over
the edges of the aerofoil becomes turbulent, and the form of
the stream lines suddenly changes. Aeroplane also probably
becomes deformed.]

(N) In a balanced glider for stability a separate surface
at a negative angle to the line of flight is essential. [Compare
F.]

(O) A keel surface should be situated well above and
behind the centre of gravity.

(P) An aeroplane is a conservative system, and stability[15]
is greatest when the kinetic energy is a maximum. (Illustration,
the pendulum.)

§ 3. Referring to A. Models with a plane or flat surface
are not unstable, and will fly well without a tail; such a
machine is called a simple monoplane.



Fig. 4.&mdash;One of Mr. Burge Webb's Simple Monoplanes.
Showing balance weight A (movable), and also his winding-up
gear&mdash;a very handy device.


§ 4. Referring to D. Many model builders make this
mistake, i.e., the mistake of getting as low a centre of
gravity as possible under the quite erroneous idea that
they are thereby increasing the stability of the machine.
Theoretically the centre of gravity should be the centre of head
resistance, as also the centre of pressure.

In practice some prefer to put the centre of gravity in
models slightly above the centre of head resistance, the
reason being that, generally speaking, wind gusts have a[16]
"lifting" action on the machine. It must be carefully
borne in mind, however, that if the centre of wind pressure
on the aerofoil surface and the centre of gravity do not
coincide, no matter at what point propulsive action be
applied, it can be proved by quite elementary mechanics
that such an arrangement, known as "acentric," produces a
couple tending to upset the machine.

This action is the probable cause of many failures.



Fig. 5.&mdash;The Stringfellow Model Monoplane of 1848.


§ 5. Referring to E. If the propulsive action does not
pass through the centre of gravity the system again becomes
"acentric." Even supposing condition D fulfilled, and we
arrive at the following most important result, viz., that for
stability:&mdash;

The centres of gravity, of pressure, of head
resistance, should be coincident, and the propulsive[17]
action of the propeller pass through this
same point.



Fig. 6.&mdash;The Stringfellow Model Triplane of 1868.


§ 6. Referring to F and N&mdash;the problem of longitudinal
stability. There is one absolutely essential feature
not mentioned in F or N, and that is for automatic
longitudinal stability the two surfaces, the aerofoil proper and
the balancer (elevator or tail, or both), must be separated by
some considerable distance, a distance not less than four times
the width of the main aerofoil.[9] More is better.



Fig. 7. PÉNAUD 1871


§ 7. With one exception (Pénaud) early experimenters
with model aeroplanes had not grasped this all-important
fact, and their models would not fly, only make a series of
jumps, because they failed to balance longitudinally. In[18]
Stringfellow's and Tatin's models the main aerofoil and
balancer (tail) are practically contiguous.

Pénaud in his rubber-motored models appears to have
fully realised this (vide Fig. 7), and also the necessity for
using long strands of rubber. Some of his models flew
150 ft., and showed considerable stability.



Fig. 8.&mdash;Tatin's Aeroplane (1879).
Surface 0·7 sq. metres, total weight 1·75 kilogrammes,
velocity of sustentation 8 metres a second. Motor,
compressed air (for description see §&nbsp;23, ch. iv). Revolved
round and round a track tethered to a post at the
centre. In one of its jumps it cleared the head of a
spectator.


With three surfaces one would set the elevator at a
slight plus angle, main aerofoil horizontal (neither positive
nor negative), and the tail at a corresponding negative angle
to the positive one of the elevator.

Referring to O.[10] One would naturally be inclined to
put a keel surface&mdash;or, in other words, vertical fins&mdash;beneath
the centre of gravity, but D shows us this may
have the opposite effect to what we might expect.[19]

In full-sized machines, those in which the distance between
the main aerofoil and balancers is considerable (like
the Farman) show considerable automatic longitudinal
stability, and those in which it is short (like the Wright)
are purposely made so with the idea of doing away with it,
and rendering the machine quicker and more sensitive to
personal control. In the case of the Stringfellow and Tatin
models we have the extreme case&mdash;practically the bird
entirely volitional and personal&mdash;which is the opposite in
every way to what we desire on a model under no personal
or volitional control at all.



Fig. 9.&mdash;Clark's Model Flyer.

Main aerofoil set at a slight negative angle. Dihedral angles
on both aerofoils.


The theoretical conditions stated in F and N are fully
borne out in practice.

And since a curved aerofoil even when set at a slight
negative angle has still considerable powers of sustentation,
it is possible to give the main aerofoil a slight negative
angle and the elevator a slight positive one. This fact is of[20]
the greatest importance, since it enables us to counteract the
effect of the travel of the "centre of pressure."[11]



Fig. 10.&mdash;Large Model Monoplane.
Designed and constructed by the author, with vertical fin
(no dihedral angle). With a larger and more efficient
propeller than the one here shown some excellent
flights were obtained. Constructed of bamboo and
nainsook. Stayed with steel wire.


§ 8. Referring to I. This, again, is of primary importance
in longitudinal stability. The Farman machine has three
such planes&mdash;elevator, main aerofoil, tail the Wright originally
had not, but is now being fitted with a tail, and experiments
on the Short-Wright biplane have quite proved its
stabilising efficiency.

The three plane (triple monoplane) in the case of models[21]
has been tried, but possesses no advantage so far over the
double monoplane type. The writer has made many
experiments with vertical fins, and has found the machine
very stable, even when the fin or vertical keel is placed some
distance above the centre of gravity.

§ 9. The question of transverse (side to side) stability
at once brings us to the question of the dihedral angle,
practically similar in its action to a flat plane with vertical
fins.



Fig. 11.&mdash;Sir George Cayley's Flying Machine.
Eight feathers, two corks, a thin rod, a piece of whalebone,
and a piece of thread.


§ 10. The setting up of the front surface at an angle to
the rear, or the setting of these at corresponding compensatory
angles already dealt with, is nothing more nor less than
the principle of the dihedral angle for longitudinal stability.



Fig. 12.&mdash;Various Forms of Dihedrals.


As early as the commencement of last century Sir George
Cayley (a man more than a hundred years ahead of his
times) was the first to point out that two planes at a dihedral
[23]angle constitute a basis of stability. For, on the machine
heeling over, the side which is required to rise gains resistance
by its new position, and that which is required to sink
loses it.

§ 11. The dihedral angle principle may take many forms.

As in Fig. 12 a is a monoplane, the rest biplanes. The
angles and curves are somewhat exaggerated. It is quite
a mistake to make the angle excessive, the "lift" being
thereby diminished. A few degrees should suffice.

Whilst it is evident enough that transverse stability is
promoted by making the sustaining surface trough-shaped,
it is not so evident what form of cross section is the most
efficient for sustentation and equilibrium combined.



Fig. 13.


It is evident that the righting moment of a unit of
surface of an aeroplane is greater at the outer edge than
elsewhere, owing to the greater lever arm.

§ 12. The "upturned tip" dihedral certainly appears to
have the advantage.

The outer edges of the aerofoil then should be turned
upward for the purpose of transverse stability, while the inner
surface should remain flat or concave for greater support.

§ 13. The exact most favourable outline of transverse
section for stability, steadiness and buoyancy has not yet
been found; but the writer has found the section given in
Fig. 13, a very efficient one.





[24]
CHAPTER IV.

THE MOTIVE POWER.


Section I.&mdash;Rubber Motors.

§ 1. Some forty years have elapsed since Pénaud first used
elastic (rubber) for model aeroplanes, and during that time
no better substitute (in spite of innumerable experiments)
has been found. Nor for the smaller and lighter class of
models is there any likelihood of rubber being displaced.
Such being the case, a brief account of some experiments on
this substance as a motive power for the same may not be
without interest. The word elastic (in science) denotes:
the tendency which a body has when distorted to return to its
original shape. Glass and ivory (within certain limits) are
two of the most elastic bodies known. But the limits
within which most bodies can be distorted (twisted or
stretched, or both) without either fracture or a Large permanent
alteration of shape is very small. Not so rubber&mdash;it
far surpasses in this respect even steel springs.

§ 2. Let us take a piece of elastic (rubber) cord, and
stretch it with known weights and observe carefully what
happens. We shall find that, first of all: the extension is
proportional to the weight suspended&mdash;but soon we have an
increasing increase of extension. In one experiment made
by the writer, when the weights were removed the rubber
cord remained 1/8 of an inch longer, and at the end of an
hour recovered itself to the extent of 1/16, remaining finally[25]
permanently 1/16 of an
inch longer. Length of
elastic cord used in this
experiment 8-1/8 inches,
3/16 of an inch thick.
Suspended weights, 1 oz.
up to 64 oz. Extension
from &frac14; inch up to 24-5/8
inches. Graph drawn in
Fig. 14, No. B abscissæ
extension in eighths of
an inch, ordinates
weights in ounces. So
long as the graph is a
straight line it shows
the extension is proportional
to the suspended
weight; afterwards in
excess.



Fig. 14.&mdash;Weight and Extension.
B, rubber 3/16 in. thick; C, 2/16 in. thick; D, 1/16 in. thick. A, theoretical line if extension were
proportional to weight.


In this experiment
we have been able to
stretch (distort) a piece
of rubber to more than
three times its original
length, and afterwards it
finally returns to almost
its original length: not
only so, a piece of rubber
cord can be stretched to
eight or nine times its
original length without
fracture. Herein lies its
supreme advantage over[26]
steel or other springs. Weight for weight more energy can
be got or more work be done by stretched (or twisted, or, to
speak more correctly, by stretched-twisted) rubber cord than
from any form of steel spring.[12] It is true it is stretched&mdash;twisted&mdash;far
beyond what is called the "elastic limit," and its
efficiency falls off, but with care not nearly so quickly as is
commonly supposed, but in spite of this and other drawbacks
its advantages far more than counterbalance these.

§ 3. Experimenting with cords of varying thickness we
find that: the extension is inversely proportional to the thickness.
If we leave a weight hanging on a piece of rubber
cord (stretched, of course, beyond its "elastic limit") we
find that: the cord continues to elongate as long as the weight
is left on. For example: a 1 lb. weight hung on a piece
of rubber cord, 8-1/8 inches long and 1/8 of an inch thick,
stretched it&mdash;at first&mdash;6&frac14; inches; after two minutes this had
increased to 6-5/8 (3/8 of an inch more). One hour later 1/8 of
an inch more, and sixteen hours later 1/8 of an inch more, i.e.
a sixteen hours' hang produced an additional extension of &frac34; of
an inch. On a thinner cord (half the thickness) same weight
produced an additional extension (after 14 hours) of 10-3/8 in.

N.B.&mdash;An elastic cord or spring balance should never
have a weight left permanently on it&mdash;or be subjected to
a distorting force for a longer time than necessary, or it
will take a "permanent set," and not return to even approximately
its original length or form.

In a rubber cord the extension is directly proportional to
the length as well as inversely proportional to the thickness
and to the weight suspended&mdash;true only within the limits of
elasticity.



Fig. 15.&mdash;Extension and Increase in Volume.


§ 4. When a Rubber Cord is stretched there is
an Increase of Volume.&mdash;On stretching a piece of[27]
rubber cord to twice its original (natural) length, we should
perhaps expect to find that the string would only be half as
thick, as would be the case if the volume remained the
same. Performing the experiment, and measuring the cord
as accurately as possible with a micrometer, measuring to the[28]
one-thousandth of an inch, we at once perceive that this is
not the case, being about two-thirds of its former volume.

§ 5. In the case of rubber cord used for a motive power
on model aeroplanes, the rubber is both twisted and stretched,
but chiefly the latter.

Thirty-six strands of rubber, weight about 56 grammes,
at 150 turns give a torque of 4 oz. on a 5-in. arm, but an
end thrust, or end pull, of about 3&frac12; lb. (Ball bearings, or
some such device, can be used to obviate this end thrust
when desirable.) A series of experiments undertaken by the
writer on the torque produced by twisted rubber strands,
varying in number, length, etc., and afterwards carefully
plotted out in graph form, have led to some very interesting
and instructive results. Ball bearings were used, and the
torque, measured in eighths of an ounce, was taken (in each
case) from an arm 5 in. in length.

The following are the principal results arrived at. For
graphs, see Fig. 16.

§ 6. A. Increasing the number of (rubber) strands by
one-half (length and thickness of rubber remaining constant)
increases the torque (unwinding tendency) twofold, i.e.,
doubles the motive power.

B. Doubling the number of strands increases the torque
more than three times&mdash;about 3-1/3 times, 3 times up to 100
turns, 3&frac12; times from 100 to 250 turns.

C. Trebling the number of strands increases the
torque at least seven times.

The increased size of the coils, and thereby increased
extension, explains this result. As we increase the number
of strands, the number of twists or turns that can be given
it becomes less.

D. Doubling the number of strands (length, etc., remaining
constant) diminishes the number of turns by one-third[29]
[30]to one-half. (In few strands one-third, in 30 and over one-half.)



Fig. 16.&mdash;Torque Graphs of Rubber Motors.

Abscissæ = Turns.Ordinates = Torque measured in 1/16 of an oz. Length of arm, 5 in.
A.38 strands of new rubber, 2 ft. 6 in. long; 58 grammes weight.
B.36 strands, 2 ft. 6 in. long; end thrust at 150 turns, 3&frac12; lb.
C.32 strands, 2 ft. 6 in. long.

F.12 &quot; 1 ft. 3 in. long
G.12 &quot; 2 ft. 6 in. long.



E. If we halve the length of the rubber strands, keeping
the number of strands the same, the torque is but slightly
increased for the first 100 turns; at 240 turns it is double.
But the greater number of turns&mdash;in ratio of about 2:1&mdash;that
can be given the longer strand much more than compensates
for this.

F. No arrangement of the strands, per se, gets more
energy (more motive power) out of them than any other,
but there are special reasons for making the strands&mdash;

G. As long and as few in number as possible.

1. More turns can be given it.

2. It gives a far more even torque. Twelve strands
2 ft. 6 in. long give practically a line of small constant
angle. Thirty-six strands same length a much steeper
angle, with considerable variations.

A very good result, which the writer has verified in
practice, paying due regard to both propeller and motor, is
to make&mdash;

H. The length of the rubber strands twice[13] in feet the
number of the strands in inches,[14] e.g., if the number of
strands is 12 their length should be 2 ft., if 18, 3 ft., and
so on.

§ 7. Experiments with 32 to 38 strands 2 ft. 6 in. long
give a torque curve almost precisely similar to that obtained
from experiments made with flat spiral steel springs, similar
to those used in watches and clocks; and, as we know, the
torque given by such springs is very uneven, and has to be
equalised by use of a fusee, or some such device. In[31]
the case of such springs it must not be forgotten that the
turning moment (unwinding tendency) is NOT proportional
to the amount of winding up, this being true only in the
"balance" springs of watches, etc., where both ends of the
spring are rigidly fastened.

In the case of Spring Motors.[15]

I. The turning moment (unwinding tendency) is proportional
to the difference between the angle of winding and
yielding, proportional to the moment of inertia of its section,
i.e., to the breadth and the cube of its thickness, also proportional
to the modulus of elasticity of the substance used,
and inversely proportional to the length of the strip.

§ 8. Referring back to A, B, C, there are one or two
practical deductions which should be carefully noted.

Supposing we have a model with one propeller and
36 strands of elastic. If we decide to fit it with twin screws,
then, other reasons apart, we shall require two sets of
strands of more than 18 in number each to have the same
motive power (27 if the same torque be required).[16] This is
an important point, and one not to be lost sight of when
thinking of using two propellers.

Experiments on&mdash;

§9. The Number of Revolutions (turns) that can
be given to Rubber Motors led to interesting results,
e.g., the number of turns to produce a double knot in the cord
from end to end were, in the case of rubber, one yard long:&mdash;


No. of Strands.No. of Turns.No. of Strands.No. of Turns.
444016200
831028170
12250


[32]

It will be at once noticed that the greater the number
of rubber strands used in a given length, the fewer turns will
it stand in proportion. For instance, 8 strands double knot
at 310, and 4 at 440 (and not at 620), 16 at 200, and 8 at
310 (and not 400), and so on. The reason, of course, is the
more the strands the greater the distance they have to travel
round themselves.

§ 10. The Maximum Number of Turns.&mdash;As to
the maximum number of permissible turns, rubber has
rupture stress of 330 lb. per sq. in., but a very high permissible
stress, as much as 80 per cent. The resilience
(power of recovery after distortion) in tension of rubber is
in considerable excess of any other substance, silk being the
only other substance which at all approaches it in this
respect, the ratio being about 11 : 9. The resilience of
steel spiral spring is very slight in comparison.

A rubber motor in which the double knot is not exceeded
by more than 100 turns (rubber one yard in length)
should last a good time. When trying for a record flight,
using new elastic, as many as even 500 or 600 or even
more turns have been given in the case of 32-36 strands a
yard in length; but such a severe strain soon spoils the
rubber.

§ 11. On the Use of "Lubricants."&mdash;One of the
drawbacks to rubber is that if it be excessively strained it
soon begins to break up. One of the chief causes of this is
that the strands stick together&mdash;they should always be
carefully separated, if necessary, after a flight&mdash;and an
undue strain is thereby cast on certain parts. Apart also
from this the various strands are not subject to the same
tension. It has been suggested that if some means could
be devised to prevent this, and allow the strands to slip over
one another, a considerable increase of power might result. It[33]
must, however, be carefully borne in mind that anything of
an oily or greasy nature has an injurious effect on the
rubber, and must be avoided at all costs. Benzol, petroleum,
ether, volatile oils, turpentine, chloroform, naphtha,
vaseline, soap, and all kinds of oil must be carefully avoided,
as they soften the rubber, and reduce it more or less to the
consistence of a sticky mass. The only oil which is said to
have no action on rubber, or practically none, is castor oil;
all the same, I do not advise its use as a lubricant.

There are three only which we need consider:&mdash;

1. Soda and water.
2. French chalk.
3. Pure redistilled glycerine.

The first is perfectly satisfactory when freshly applied,
but soon dries up and evaporates.

The second falls off; and unless the chalk be of the
softest kind, free from all grit and hard particles, it will
soon do more harm than good.

The third, glycerine, is for ordinary purposes by far the
best, and has a beneficial rather than a deleterious effect on
the rubber; but it must be pure. The redistilled kind,
free from all traces of arsenic, grease, etc., is the only kind
permissible. It does not evaporate, and a few drops, comparatively
speaking, will lubricate fifty or sixty yards of
rubber.

Being of a sticky or tacky nature it naturally gathers up
dust and particles of dirt in course of time. To prevent
these grinding into the rubber, wash it from time to time in
warm soda, and warm and apply fresh glycerine when
required.

Glycerine, unlike vaseline (a product of petroleum), is
not a grease; it is formed from fats by a process known as[34]
saponification, or treatment of the oil with caustic alkali,
which decomposes the compound, forming an alkaline
stearate (soap), and liberating the glycerine which remains
in solution when the soap is separated by throwing in
common salt. In order to obtain pure glycerine, the fat
can be decomposed by lead oxide, the glycerine remaining
in solution, and the lead soap or plaster being precipitated.

By using glycerine as a lubricant the number of turns
that can be given a rubber motor is greatly increased, and
the coils slip over one another freely and easily, and prevent
the throwing of undue strain on some particular portion,
and absolutely prevent the strands from sticking together.

§ 12. The Action of Copper upon Rubber.&mdash;Copper,
whether in the form of the metal, the oxides, or the
soluble salts, has a marked injurious action upon rubber.

In the case of metallic copper this action has been
attributed to oxidation induced by the dissolved oxygen
in the copper. In working drawings for model aeroplanes I
have noticed designs in which the hooks on which the rubber
strands were to be stretched were made of copper. In no
case should the strands be placed upon bare metal. I
always cover mine with a piece of valve tubing, which can
easily be renewed from time to time.

§ 12A. The Action of Water, etc., on Rubber.&mdash;Rubber
is quite insoluble in water; but it must not be
forgotten that it will absorb about 25 per cent. into its pores
after soaking for some time.

Ether, chloroform, carbon-tetrachloride, turpentine,
carbon bi-sulphide, petroleum spirit, benzene and its homologues
found in coal-tar naphtha, dissolve rubber readily.
Alcohol is absorbed by rubber, but is not a solvent of it.

§ 12B. How to Preserve Rubber.&mdash;In the first
place, in order that it shall be possible to preserve and keep[35]
rubber in the best condition of efficiency, it is absolutely
essential that the rubber shall be, when obtained, fresh and
of the best kind. Only the best Para rubber should be
bought; to obtain it fresh it should be got in as large
quantities as possible direct from a manufacturer or reliable
rubber shop. The composition of the best Para rubber is
as follows:&mdash;Carbon, 87·46 per cent.; hydrogen, 12·00 per
cent.; oxygen and ash, 0·54 per cent.

In order to increase its elasticity the pure rubber has to
be vulcanised before being made into the sheet some
sixty or eighty yards in length, from which the rubber
threads are cut; after vulcanization the substance consists of
rubber plus about 3 per cent. of sulphur. Now, unfortunately,
the presence of the sulphur makes the rubber more prone
to atmospheric oxidation. Vulcanized rubber, compared to
pure rubber, has then but a limited life. It is to this
process of oxidation that the more or less rapid deterioration
of rubber is due.

To preserve rubber it should be kept from the sun's
rays, or, indeed, any actinic rays, in a cool, airy place, and
subjected to as even a temperature as possible. Great extremes
of temperature have a very injurious effect on rubber, and
it should be washed from time to time in warm soda water.
It should be subjected to no tension or compression.

Deteriorated rubber is absolutely useless for model
aeroplanes.

§ 13. To Test Rubber.&mdash;Good elastic thread composed
of pure Para rubber and sulphur should, if properly
made, stretch to seven times its length, and then return to
its original length. It should also possess a stretching
limit at least ten times its original length.

As already stated, the threads or strands are cut from
sheets; these threads can now be cut fifty to the inch. For[36]
rubber motors a very great deal so far as length of life
depends on the accuracy and skill with which the strands are
cut. When examined under a microscope (not too powerful)
the strands having the least ragged edge, i.e., the best cut,
are to be preferred.

§ 14. The Section&mdash;Strip or Ribbon versus
Square.&mdash;In section the square and not the ribbon or strip
should be used. The edge of the strip I have always found
more ragged under the microscope than the square. I have
also found it less efficient. Theoretically no doubt a round
section would be best, but none such (in small sizes) is
on the market. Models have been fitted with a tubular
section, but such should on no account be used.

§ 15. Size of the Section.&mdash;One-sixteenth or one-twelfth
is the best size for ordinary models; personally, I
prefer the thinner. If more than a certain number of
strands are required to provide the necessary power, a larger
size should be used. It is not easy to say what this number
is, but fifty may probably be taken as an outside limit.
Remember the size increases by area section; twice the
sectional height and breadth means four times the rubber.

§ 16. Geared Rubber Motors.&mdash;It is quite a mistake
to suppose that any advantage can be obtained by using a
four to one gearing, say; all that you do obtain is one-fourth
of the power minus the increased friction, minus the added
weight. This presumes, of course, you make no alteration in
your rubber strands.

Gearing such as this means short rubber strands, and
such are not to be desired; in any case, there is the difficulty
of increased friction and added weight to overcome.
It is true by splitting up your rubber motor into two sets of
strands instead of one you can obtain more turns, but, as we
have seen, you must increase the number of strands to get[37]
the same thrust, and you have this to counteract any
advantage you gain as well as added weight and friction.

§ 17. The writer has tried endless experiments with all
kinds of geared rubber motors, and the only one worth a
moment's consideration is the following, viz., one in which
two gear wheels&mdash;same size, weight, and number of teeth&mdash;are
made use of, the propeller being attached to the axle of
one of them, and the same number of strands are used on
each axle. The success or non-success of this motor depends
entirely on the method used in its construction. At first
sight it may appear that no great skill is required in the
construction of such a simple piece of apparatus. No
greater mistake could be made. It is absolutely necessary
that the friction and weight be reduced to a minimum, and the
strength be a maximum. The torque of the rubber strands
on so short an arm is very great.

Ordinary light brass cogwheels will not stand the
strain.

A. The cogwheels should be of steel[17] and accurately cut
of diameter sufficient to separate the two strands the
requisite distance, but no more.

B. The weight must be a minimum. This is best
attained by using solid wheels, and lightening by drilling and
turning.

C. The friction must be a minimum. Use the lightest
ball bearings obtainable (these weigh only 0·3 gramme),
adjust the wheels so that they run with the greatest freedom,
but see that the teeth overlap sufficiently to stand the strain
and slight variations in direction without fear of slipping.
Shallow teeth are useless.

D. Use vaseline on the cogs to make them run as easily
as possible.[38]



Fig. 17.&mdash;Geared Rubber Motor.

Designed and constructed by the writer. For description
of the model, etc., see Appendix.


E. The material of the containing framework must be of
maximum strength and minimum lightness. Construct it
of minimum size, box shaped, use the thinnest tin (really
tinned sheet-iron) procurable, and lighten by drilling holes,[39]
not too large, all over it. Do not use aluminium or magnalium.
Steel, could it be procured thin enough, would be
better still.

F. Use steel pianoforte wire for the spindles, and hooks
for the rubber strands, using as thin wire as will stand the
strain.

Unless these directions are carefully carried out no
advantage will be gained&mdash;the writer speaks from experience.
The requisite number of rubber strands to give the
best result must be determined by experiment.

§ 18. One advantage in using such a motor as this is
that the two equal strands untwisting in opposite directions
have a decided steadying effect on the model, similar almost
to the case in which two propellers are used.

The "best" model flights that the writer has achieved
have been obtained with a motor of this description.[18]

In the case of twin screws two such gearings can be used,
and the rubber split up into four strands. The containing
framework in this case can be simply light pieces of tubing
let into the wooden framework, or very light iron pieces
fastened thereto.

Do not attempt to split up the rubber into more than two
strands to each propeller.


Section II.&mdash;Other Forms of Motors.

§ 18A. Spring Motors.&mdash;This question has already
been dealt with more or less whilst dealing with rubber
motors, and the superiority of the latter over the former
pointed out. Rubber has a much greater superiority over
steel or other springs, because in stretch-twisted rubber far[40]
more energy can be stored up weight for weight. One
pound weight of elastic can be made to store up some
320 ft.-lb. of energy, and steel only some 65 lb. And in
addition to this there is the question of gearing, involving
extra weight and friction; that is, if flat steel springs similar
to those used in clockwork mechanism be made use of, as
is generally the case. The only instance in which such
springs are of use is for the purpose of studying the effects
of different distributions of weight on the model, and its
effect on the balance of the machine; but effects such as
this can be brought about without a change of motor.

§ 18B. A more efficient form of spring motor, doing away
with gearing troubles, is to use a long spiral spring (as long
as the rubber strands) made of medium-sized piano wire,
similar in principle to those used in some roller-blinds, but
longer and of thinner steel.

The writer has experimented with such, as well as scores
of other forms of spring motors, but none can compare with
rubber.

The long spiral form of steel spring is, however, much
the best.

§ 18C. Compressed Air Motors.&mdash;This is a very
fascinating form of motor, on paper, and appears at first sight
the ideal form. It is so easy to write: "Its weight is negligible,
and it can be provided free of cost; all that is necessary is
to work a bicycle pump for as many minutes as the motor
is desired to run. This stored-up energy can be contained in
a mere tube, of aluminium or magnalium, forming the central
rib of the machine, and the engine mechanism necessary for
conveying this stored-up energy to the revolving propeller
need weigh only a few ounces." Another writer recommends
"a pressure of 300 lb."

§ 18D. A pneumatic drill generally works at about 80 lb.[41]
pressure, and when developing 1 horse-power, uses about
55 cubic ft. of free air per minute. Now if we apply this to
a model aeroplane of average size, taking a reservoir 3 ft.
long by 1&frac12; in. internal diameter, made of magnalium, say&mdash;steel
would, of course, be much better&mdash;the weight of which
would certainly not be less than 4 oz., we find that at 80 lb.
pressure such a motor would use

55 / Horse Power (H.P.)

cub. ft. per minute.

Now 80 lb. is about 5&frac12; atmospheres, and the cubical
contents of the above motor some 63 cub. in. The time
during which such a model would fly depends on the H.P.
necessary for flight; but a fair allowance gives a flight of from
10 to 30 sec. I take 80 lb. pressure as a fair practical limit.

§ 18E. The pressure in a motor-car tyre runs from 40 to
80 lb., usually about 70 lb. Now 260 strokes are required
with an ordinary inflator to obtain so low a pressure as
70 lb., and it is no easy job, as those who have done it know.

§ 19. Prior to 1893 Mr. Hargraves (of cellular kite fame)
studied the question of compressed-air motors for model
flying machines. His motor was described as a marvel
of simplicity and lightness, its cylinder was made like a
common tin can, the cylinder covers cut from sheet tin
and pressed to shape, the piston and junk rings of ebonite.

One of his receivers was 23-3/8 in. long, and 5·5 in.
diameter, of aluminium plate 0·2 in. thick, 3/8 in. by 1/8 in.
riveting strips were insufficient to make tight joints; it
weighed 26 oz., and at 80 lb. water pressure one of the ends
blew out, the fracture occurring at the bend of the flange,
and not along the line of rivets. The receiver which was
successful being apparently a tin-iron one; steel tubing was
not to be had at that date in Sydney. With a receiver of[42]
this character, and the engine referred to above, a flight of
343 ft. was obtained, this flight being the best. (The
models constructed by him were not on the aeroplane, but
ornithoptere, or wing-flapping principle.) The time of flight
was 23 seconds, with 54&frac12; double vibrations of the engines.
The efficiency of this motor was estimated to be 29 per cent.

§ 20. By using compressed air, and heating it in its
passage to the cylinder, far greater efficiency can be obtained.
Steel cylinders can be obtained containing air under the
enormous pressure of 120 atmospheres.[19] This is practically
liquid air. A 20-ft. cylinder weighs empty 23 lb. The
smaller the cylinder the less the proportionate pressure that
it will stand; and supposing a small steel cylinder, produced
of suitable form and weight, and capable of withstanding
with safety a pressure of from 300 to 600 lb. per sq. in., or
from 20 to 40 atmospheres. The most economical way of
working would be to admit the air from the reservoir directly
to the motor cylinders; but this would mean a very great
range in the initial working pressure, entailing not-to-be-thought-of
weight in the form of multi-cylinder compound
engines, variable expansion gear, etc.

§ 21. This means relinquishing the advantages of the
high initial pressure, and the passing of the air through a
reducing valve, whereby a constant pressure, say, of 90 to
150, according to circumstances, could be maintained. By
a variation in the ratio of expansion the air could be worked
down to, say, 30 lb.

The initial loss entailed by the use of a reducing valve
may be in a great measure restored by heating the air before
using it in the motor cylinders; by heating it to a temperature
of only 320°F., by means of a suitable burner, the
volume of air is increased by one half, the consumption[43]
being reduced in the same proportion; the consumption of
air used in this way being 24 lb. per indicated horse-power
per hour. But this means extra weight in the form of fuel
and burners, and what we gain in one way we lose in
another. It is, of course, desirable that the motor should
work at as low a pressure as possible, since as the store of
air is used up the pressure in the reservoir falls, until it
reaches a limit below which it cannot usefully be employed.
The air then remaining is dead and useless, adding only to
the weight of the aeroplane.

§ 22. From calculations made by the writer the entire
weight of a compressed-air model motor plant would be at
least one-third the weight of the aeroplane, and on a small
scale probably one-half, and cannot therefore hold comparison
with the steam engine discussed in the next paragraph.
In concluding these remarks on compressed-air
motors, I do not wish to dissuade anyone from trying this
form of motor; but they must not embark on experiments
with the idea that anything useful or anything superior to
results obtained with infinitely less expense by means of
rubber can be brought to pass with a bicycle pump, a bit of
magnalium tube, and 60 lb. pressure.

§ 22A. In Tatin's air-compressed motor the reservoir
weighed 700 grammes, and had a capacity of 8 litres. It was
tested to withstand a pressure of 20 atmospheres, but was
worked only up to seven. The little engine attached thereto
weighed 300 grammes, and developed a motive power of
2 kilogram-metres per second (see ch. iii.).

§ 23. Steam-Driven Motors.&mdash;Several successful
steam-engined model aeroplanes have been constructed, the
most famous being those of Professor Langley.

Having constructed over 30 modifications of rubber-driven
models, and experimented with compressed air,[44]
carbonic-acid gas, electricity, and other methods of obtaining
energy, he finally settled upon the steam engine (the
petrol motor was not available at that time, 1893). After
many months' work it was found that the weight could not
be reduced below 40 lb., whilst the engine would only
develop &frac12; H.P., and finally the model was condemned. A
second apparatus to be worked by compressed air was tried,
but the power proved insufficient. Then came another with
a carbonic-acid gas engine. Then others with various
applications of electricity and gas, etc., but the steam engine
was found most suitable; yet it seemed to become more and
more doubtful whether it could ever be made sufficiently
light, and whether the desired end could be attained at all.
The chief obstacle proved not to be with the engines, which
were made surprisingly light after sufficient experiment.
The great difficulty was to make a boiler of almost no weight
which would give steam enough.

§ 24. At last a satisfactory boiler and engine were
produced.

The engine was of 1 to 1&frac12; H.P., total weight (including
moving parts) 26 oz. The cylinders, two in number, had
each a diameter of 1&frac14; in., and piston stroke 2 in.

The boiler, with its firegrate, weighed a little over 5 lb.
It consisted of a continuous helix of copper tubing, 3/8 in.
external diameter, the diameter of the coil being 3 in.
altogether. Through the centre of this was driven the blast
from an "Ælopile," a modification of the naphtha blow-torch
used by plumbers, the flame of which is about 2000° F.[20]
The pressure of steam issuing into the engines varied from[45]
100 to 150 lb. per sq. in.; 4 lb. weight of water and about
10 oz. of naphtha could be carried. The boiler evaporated
1 lb. of water per minute.

The twin propellers, 39 in. in diam., pitch 1&frac14;, revolved
from 800 to 1000 a minute. The entire aeroplane was 15 ft.
in length, the aerofoils from tip to tip about 14 ft.,
and the total weight slightly less than 30 lb., of which
one-fourth was contained in the machinery. Its flight was a
little over half a mile in length, and of 1&frac12; minutes' duration.
Another model flew for about three-quarters of a
mile, at a rate of about 30 miles an hour.

It will be noted that engine, generator, etc., work out at
about 7 lb. per H.P. Considerable advance has been made
in the construction of light and powerful model steam
engines since Langley's time, chiefly in connexion with
model hydroplanes, and a pressure of from 500 to 600 lb.
per sq. in. has been employed; the steam turbine has been
brought to a high state of perfection, and it is now possible
to make a model De Laval turbine of considerable power
weighing almost next to nothing,[21] the real trouble, in
fact the only one, being the steam generator. An economization
of weight means a waste of steam, of which models
can easily spend their only weight in five minutes.

§ 25. One way to economize without increased weight in
the shape of a condenser is to use spirit (methylated spirit,
for instance) for both fuel and boiler, and cause the exhaust
from the engines to be ejected on to the burning spirit,
where it itself serves as fuel. By using spirit, or some very
volatile hydrocarbon, instead of water, we have a further
advantage from the fact that such vaporize at a much
lower temperature than water.[46]

§ 26. When experimenting with an engine of the turbine
type we must use a propeller of small diameter and pitch,
owing to the very high velocity at which such engines run.

Anyone, however, who is not an expert on such matters
would do well to leave such motors alone, as the very
highest technical skill, combined with many preliminary
disappointments and trials, are sure to be encountered before
success is attained.

§ 27. And the smaller the model the more difficult the
problem&mdash;halve your aeroplane, and your difficulties increase
anything from fourfold to tenfold.

The boiler would in any case be of the flash type of
either copper or steel tubing (the former for safety), with a
magnalium container for the spirit, and a working pressure
of from 150 to 200 lb. per sq. in. Anything less than this
would not be worth consideration.

§ 28. Some ten months after Professor Langley's successful
model flights (1896), experiments were made in
France at Carquenez, near Toulon. The total weight of
the model aeroplane in this case was 70 lb.; the engine
power a little more than 1 H.P. Twin screws were used&mdash;one
in front and one behind. The maximum velocity
obtained was 40 miles per hour; but the length of run only
154 yards, and duration of flight only a few seconds. This
result compares very poorly with Langley's distance (of best
flight), nearly one mile, duration 1 min. 45 sec. The
maximum velocity was greater&mdash;30 to 40 miles per hour.
The total breadth of this large model was rather more than
6 metres, and the surface a little more than 8 sq. metres.

§ 29. Petrol Motors.&mdash;Here it would appear at first
thought is the true solution of the problem of the model
aeroplane motor. Such a motor has solved the problem of
aerial locomotion, as the steam engine solved that of terres[47]trial
and marine travel, both full sized and model; and if
in the case of full sized machines, then why not models.

§ 30. The exact size of the smallest working model steam
engine that has been made I do not know,[22] but it is or could[48]
be surprisingly small; not so the petrol motor&mdash;not one,
that is, that would work. The number of petrol motor-driven
model aeroplanes that have actually flown is very
small. Personally I only know of one, viz., Mr. D.
Stanger's, exhibited at the aero exhibition at the Agricultural
Hall in 1908.

of engine may be gathered by comparing it with the
ordinary sparking-plug seen by the side, whilst to the

§ 31. The following are the chief particulars of this
interesting machine:&mdash;The engine is a four-cylinder one,
and weighs (complete with double carburetter and petrol tank)
5&frac12; lb., and develops 1&frac14; H.P. at 1300 revolutions per minute.[50]



Fig. 22.&mdash;One-Cylinder Petrol Motor.
(Electro from Messrs. A.W. Gamage's Aviation Catalogue.)


The propeller, 29 in. in diam. and 36 in. in pitch, gives a
static thrust of about 7 lb. The machine has a spread of
8 ft. 2 in., and is 6 ft. 10 in. in length. Total weight 21 lb.
Rises from the ground when a speed of about 16 miles an[51]
hour is attained. A clockwork arrangement automatically
stops the engine. The engine air-cooled. The cylinder of
steel, cast-iron heads, aluminium crank-case, double float
feed carburetter, ignition by single coil and distributor.
The aeroplane being 7 ft. 6 in. long, and having a span
8 ft.

§ 32. One-cylinder Petrol Motors.&mdash;So far as the
writer is aware no success has as yet attended the use of a
single-cylinder petrol motor on a model aeroplane. Undoubtedly
the vibration is excessive; but this should not be
an insuperable difficulty. It is true it is heavier in proportion
than a two-cylinder one, and not so efficient; and so
far has not proved successful. The question of vibration on
a model aeroplane is one of considerable importance. A
badly balanced propeller even will seriously interfere with
and often greatly curtail the length of flight.

§ 33. Electric Motors.&mdash;No attempt should on any
account be made to use electric motors for model aeroplanes.
They are altogether too heavy, apart even from the accumulator
or source of electric energy, for the power derivable
from them. To take an extreme case, and supposing we use
a 2-oz. electric motor capable of driving a propeller giving a
static thrust of 3 oz.,[23] on weighing one of the smallest
size accumulators without case, etc., I find its weight is
4&frac12; oz. One would, of course, be of no use; at least three
would be required, and they would require practically short
circuiting to give sufficient amperage (running them down,
that is, in some 10 to 15 seconds). Total weight, 1 lb.
nearly. Now from a pound weight of rubber one could
obtain a thrust of pounds, not ounces. For scale models
not intended for actual flight, of course, electric motors have
their uses.

CHAPTER V.

PROPELLERS OR SCREWS.


§ 1. The design and construction of propellers, more
especially the former, is without doubt one of the most
difficult parts of model aeroplaning.

With elastic or spring driven models the problem is
more complicated than for models driven by petrol or some
vaporized form of liquid fuel; and less reliable information
is to hand. The problem of weight, unfortunately, is of
primary importance.

We will deal with these points in due course; to begin
with let us take:&mdash;


The Position of the Propeller.

In model aeroplanes the propeller is usually situated
either in front or in the rear of the model; in the former
case it is called a Tractor Screw, i.e., it pulls instead of
pushes.

As to the merits of the two systems with respect to the
tractor, there is, we know, in the case of models moving
through water a distinct advantage in placing the propeller
behind, and using a pushing or propulsive action, on account
of the frictional "wake" created behind the boat, and
which causes the water to flow after the vessel, but at a lesser
velocity.

In placing the propeller behind, we place it in such a
position as to act upon and make use of this phenomenon,[53]
the effect of the propeller being to bring this following
wake to rest. Theoretically a boat, model or otherwise, can
be propelled with less horse-power than it can be towed.
But with respect to aeroplanes, apart altogether from the
difference of medium, there is at present a very considerable
difference of form, an aeroplane, model or otherwise, bearing
at present but little resemblance to the hull of a boat.

Undoubtedly there is a frictional wake in the case of
aeroplanes, possibly quite as much in proportion as in the
case of a boat, allowing for difference of medium. Admitting,
then, that this wake does exist, it follows that a propulsive
screw is better than a tractor. In a matter of this kind
constructional considerations, or "ease of launching," and
"ability to land without damage," must be given due weight.

In the case of model aeroplanes constructional details
incline the balance neither one way nor the other; but
"ease in launching" and "ability to land without damage"
weigh the balance down most decidedly in favour of a
driving or propulsive screw.

In the case of full-sized monoplanes constructional
details had most to do with the use of tractors; but monoplanes
are now being built with propulsive screws.[24]

In the case of models, not models of full-sized machines,
but actual model flyers, the writer considers propulsive
screws much the best.[25]

In no case should the propeller be placed in the centre[54]
of the model, or in such a position as to shorten the strands
of the elastic motor, if good flights are desired.

In the case of petrol or similar driven models the position
of the propeller can be safely copied from actual well-recognised
and successful full-sized machines.

§ 2. The Number of Blades.&mdash;Theoretically the
number of blades does not enter into consideration. The
mass of air dealt with by the propeller is represented by a
cylinder of indefinite length, whose diameter is the same as
that of the screw, and the rate at which this cylinder is
projected to the rear depends theoretically upon the pitch
and revolutions (per minute, say) of the propeller and not
the number of blades. Theoretically one blade (helix
incomplete) would be sufficient, but such a screw would not
"balance," and balance is of primary importance; the
minimum number of blades which can be used is therefore
two.

In marine models three blades are considered best, as
giving a better balance.

In the case of their aerial prototypes the question of
weight has again to be considered, and two blades is practically
the invariable custom.[26] Here, again, constructional
considerations again come to the fore, and in the case of
wooden propellers one of two blades is of far more easy
construction than one of three.

By increasing the number of blades the "thrust" is, of
course, more evenly distributed over a larger area, but the
weight is considerably increased, and in models a greater
advantage is gained by keeping down the weight than might
follow from the use of more blades.

§ 3. Fan versus Propeller.&mdash;It must always be most[55]
carefully borne in mind that a fan (ventilating) and a propeller
are not the same thing. Because many blades are
found in practice to be efficient in the case of the former, it
is quite wrong to assume that the same conclusion holds in
the case of the latter.

By increasing the number of blades the skin friction
due to the resistance that has to be overcome in rotating
the propeller through the air is added to.

Moreover a fan is stationary, whilst a propeller is constantly
advancing as well as rotating through the air.

The action of a fan blower is to move a small quantity
of air at a high velocity; whereas the action of a propeller
is, or should be, to move a large quantity of air at a small
velocity, for the function of a screw is to create thrust.
Operating on a yielding fluid medium this thrust will
evidently be in proportion to the mass of fluid moved, and
also to the velocity at which it is put in motion.

But the power consumed in putting this mass of fluid
in motion is proportional to the mass and to the square of the
velocity at which it moves. From this it follows, as stated
above, that in order to obtain a given thrust with the least
loss of power, the mass of fluid acted on should be as large
as possible, and the velocity imparted to it as little as
possible.

A fan requires to be so designed as to create a thrust
when stationary (static thrust), and a propeller whilst moving
through the air (dynamic thrust).

§ 4. The Function of a Propeller is to produce
dynamic thrust; and the great advantage of the use of a
propeller as a thrusting or propulsive agent is that its surface
is always active. It has no dead points, and its motion is continuous
and not reciprocating, and it requires no special
machinery or moving parts in its construction and operation.[56]

§ 5. The Pitch of a propeller or screw is the linear
distance a screw moves, backwards or forwards, in one complete
revolution. This distance is purely a theoretical one.
When, for instance, a screw is said to have a pitch of 1 ft.,
or 12 in., it means that the model would advance 1 ft.
through the air for each revolution of the screw, provided
that the propeller blade were mounted in solid guides, like a
nut on a bolt with one thread per foot. In a yielding fluid
such as water or air it does not practically advance this
distance, and hence occurs what is known as&mdash;

§ 6. Slip, which may be defined as the distance which
ought to be traversed, but which is lost through imperfections
in the propelling mechanism; or it may be considered
as power which should have been used in driving the model
forward. In the case of a locomotive running on dry rails
nothing is lost in slip, there being none. In the case of a
steamer moored and her engines set going, or of an aeroplane
held back prior to starting, all the power is used in
slip, i.e. in putting the fluid in motion, and none is used in
propulsion.

Supposing the propeller on our model has a pitch of
1 ft., and we give the elastic motor 100 turns, theoretically
the model should travel 100 ft. in calm air before the propeller
is run down; no propeller yet designed will do this.
Supposing the actual length 77 ft., 23 per cent. has been
lost in "slip." For this to be actually correct the propeller
must stop at the precise instant when the machine comes to
ground.

Taking "slip" into account, then&mdash;

The speed of the model in feet per minute = pitch (in feet) ×
revolutions per minute&mdash; slip (feet per minute).

This slip wants to be made small&mdash;just how small is not
yet known.[57]

If made too small then the propeller will not be so
efficient, or, at any rate, such is the conclusion come to in
marine propulsion, where it is found for the most economical
results to be obtained that the slip should be from 10 to
20 per cent.

In the case of aerial propellers a slip of 25 per cent. is
quite good, 40 per cent. bad; and there are certain reasons
for assuming that possibly about 15 per cent. may be the
best.

§ 7. It is true that slip represents energy lost; but some
slip is essential, because without slip there could be no
"thrust," this same thrust being derived from the reaction
of the volume of air driven backwards.

The thrust is equal to&mdash;

Weight of mass of air acted on per second × slip velocity
in feet per second.

In the case of an aeroplane advancing through the air it
might be thought that the thrust would be less. Sir
Hiram Maxim found, however, as the result of his experiments
that the thrust with a propeller travelling through the
air at a velocity of 40 miles an hour was the same as when
stationary, the r.p.m. remaining constant throughout. The
explanation is that when travelling the propeller is continually
advancing on to "undisturbed" air, the "slip"
velocity is reduced, but the undisturbed air is equivalent to
acting upon a greater mass of air.

§ 8. Pitch Coefficient or Pitch Ratio.&mdash;If we
divide the pitch of a screw by its diameter we obtain what
is known as pitch coefficient or ratio.

The mean value of eighteen pitch coefficients of well-known
full-sized machines works out at 0·62, which, as it so happens,
is exactly the same as the case of the Farman machine propeller
considered alone, this ratio varying from 0·4 to 1·2;[58]
in the case of the Wright's machine it is (probably) 1. The
efficiency of their propeller is admitted on all hands. Their
propeller is, of course, a slow-speed propeller, 450 r.p.m. The
one on the Blériot monoplane (Blériot XI.) pitch ratio 0·4,
r.p.m. 1350.

In marine propulsion the pitch ratio is generally 1·3 for
a slow-speed propeller, decreasing to 0·9 for a high-speed
one. In the case of rubber-driven model aeroplanes the
pitch ratio is often carried much higher, even to over 3.

Mr. T.W.K. Clarke recommends a pitch angle of 45°,
or less, at the tips, and a pitch ratio of 3-1/7 (with an angle
of 45°). Within limits the higher the pitch ratio the better
the efficiency. The higher the pitch ratio the slower may
be the rate of revolution. Now in a rubber motor we do
not want the rubber to untwist (run out) too quickly; with
too fine a pitch the propeller "races," or does something
remarkably like it. It certainly revolves with an abnormally
high percentage of slip. And for efficiency it is certainly
desirable to push this ratio to its limit; but there is also the
question of the

§ 9. Diameter.&mdash;"The diameter (says Mr. T. W.K.
Clarke) should be equal to one-quarter the span of the
machine."

If we increase the diameter we shall decrease the pitch
ratio. From experiments which the writer has made he
prefers a lower pitch ratio and increased diameter, viz. a
pitch ratio of 1·5, and a diameter of one-third to even one-half
the span, or even more.[27] Certainly not less than
one-third. Some model makers indulge in a large pitch
ratio, angle, diameter, and blade area as well, but such a
course is not to be recommended.

§ 10. Theoretical Pitch.&mdash;Theoretically the pitch[59]
(from boss to tip) should at all points be the same; the
boss or centre of the blade at right angles to the plane of
rotation, and the angle decreasing as one approaches the
tips. This is obvious when one considers that the whole
blade has to move forward the same amount. In the
diagrams Figs. 23 and 24 the tip A of the propeller travels
a distance = 2 &#960; R every revolution.
At a point D on the blade, distant r
from the centre, the distance is 2 &#960; r.
In both instances the two points must
advance a distance equal to the pitch,
i.e. the distance represented by P O.



Fig. 23.



Fig. 24.
A O = 2&#960;R;   D O = 2&#960;r.


A will move along A P, B along
B P, and so on. The angles at the
points A, B, C ... (Fig. 24), showing
the angles at which the corresponding
parts of the blade at A, B, C ... in
Fig. 23 must be set in order that a uniform pitch may be
obtained.

§ 11. If the pitch be not uniform then there will be
some portions of the blade which will drag through the air
instead of affording useful thrust, and others which will be[60]
doing more than they ought, putting air in motion which
had better be left quiet. This uniform total pitch for all
parts of the propeller is (as already stated) a decreasing rate
of pitch from the centre to the edge. With a total pitch of
5 ft., and a radius of 4 ft., and an angle at the circumference
of 6°, then the angle of pitch at a point midway between
centre and circumference should be 12°, in order that the
total pitch may be the same at all parts.

§ 12. To Ascertain the Pitch of a Propeller.&mdash;Take
any point on one of the blades, and carefully measure the
inclination of the blade at that point to the plane of rotation.

If the angle so formed be about 19° (19·45),[28] i.e., 1 in 3,
and the point 5 in. from the centre, then every revolution
this point will travel a distance


2 &#960; r = 2 × 22/7 × 5 = 31·34.


Now since the inclination is 1 in 3,[29] the propeller will
travel forward theoretically one-third of this distance, or


31·43/3 = 10·48 = 10&frac12; in. approx.


Similarly any other case may be dealt with. If the propeller
have a uniform constant angle instead of a uniform
pitch, then the pitch may be calculated at a point about one-third
the length of the blade from the tip.

§ 13. Hollow-Faced Blades.[30]&mdash;It must always be[61]
carefully borne in mind that a propeller is nothing more nor
less than a particular form of aeroplane specially designed to
travel a helical path. It should, therefore, be hollow faced
and partake of the "stream line" form, a condition not
fulfilled if the face of the blade be flat&mdash;such a surface cutting
into the air with considerable shock, and by no means
creating as little undesirable motion in the surrounding
medium as possible.

It must not be forgotten that a curved face blade has of
necessity an increasing pitch from the cutting to the trailing
edge (considering, of course, any particular section). In
such a case the pitch is the mean effective pitch.

§ 14. Blade Area.&mdash;We have already referred to the
fact that the function of a propeller is to produce dynamic
thrust&mdash;to drive the aeroplane forward by driving the air
backwards. At the same time it is most desirable for
efficiency that the air should be set in motion as little as
possible, this being so much power wasted; to obtain the
greatest reaction or thrust the greatest possible volume of
air should be accelerated to the smallest velocity.

In marine engineering in slow-speed propellers (where
cavitation[31] does not come in) narrow blades are usually
used. In high-speed marine propellers (where cavitation is
liable to occur) the projected area of the blades is sometimes
as much as 0·6 of the total disk area. In the case of aerial
propellers, where cavitation does not occur, or not unless the
velocity be a very high one (1500 or more a minute),
narrow blades are the best. Experiments in marine propulsion
also show that the thrust depends more on the disk[62]
area than on the width of the blades. All the facts tend to
show that for efficiency the blades of the propeller should
be narrow, in order that the air may not be acted on for too
long a time, and so put too much in motion, and the blades
be so separated that one blade does not disturb the molecules
of air upon which the next following one must act. Both
in the case of marine and aerial propellers multiplicity of
blades (i.e. increased blade area) tends to inefficiency of action,
apart altogether from the question of weight and constructional
difficulties. The question of increasing pitch in the
case of hollow-faced blades, considered in the last paragraph,
has a very important bearing on the point we are considering.
To make a wide blade under such circumstances would be to
soon obtain an excessive angle.

In the case of a flat blade the same result holds, because
the air has by the contact of its molecules with the "initial
minimum width" been already accelerated up to its final
velocity, and further area is not only wasted, but inimical to
good flights, being our old bugbear "weight in excess."

Requisite strength and stiffness, of course, set a limit on
the final narrowness of the blades, apart from other considerations.

§ 15. The velocity with which the propeller is rotated has
also an important bearing on this point; but a higher speed
than 900 r.p.m. does not appear desirable, and even 700 or
less is generally preferable.[32] In case of twin-screw propellers,
with an angle at the tips of 40° to 45°, as low a velocity of
500 or even less would be still better.[33]

§ 16. Shrouding.&mdash;No improvement whatever is [63]obtained
by the use of any kind of shrouding or ring round
the propeller tips, or by corrugating the surface of the propeller,
or by using cylindrical or cone-shaped propeller
chamber or any kind of air guide either before or after the
propeller; allow it to revolve in as free an air-feed as
possible, the air does not fly off under centrifugal force,
but is powerfully sucked inwards in a well-designed propeller.





Fig. 25.
A Tube of Air.
Fig. 26.
A Cylinder of Air.




§ 17. General Design.&mdash;The propeller should be so
constructed as to act upon a tube and not a "cylinder" of
air. Many flying toys (especially the French ones) are
constructed with propellers of the cylinder type. Ease of
manufacture and the contention that those portions of the
blades adjacent to the boss do little work, and a slight
saving in weight, are arguments that can be urged in their
favour. But all the central cut away part offers resistance
in the line of travel, instead of exerting its proportionate
propulsive power, and their efficiency is affected by such a
practice.[64]

§ 18. A good Shape for the blades[34] is rectangular with
rounded corners; the radius of the circle for rounding off
the corners may be taken as about one-quarter of the width
of the blade. The shape is not truly rectangular, for the
width of this rectangular at (near) the boss should be one-half
the width at the tip.

The thickness should diminish uniformly from the boss
to the tip. (In models the thickness should be as little as
is consistent with strength to keep down the weight). The
pitch uniform and large.



Fig. 27.&mdash;O T = 1/3 O P.


§ 19. The Blades, two in number, and hollow
faced&mdash;the maximum concavity being one-third the distance
from the entering to the trailing edge; the ratio of A T
to O P (the width) being
0·048 or 1 : 21, these
latter considerations being
founded on the analogy
between a propeller and the
aerofoil surface. (If the thickness be varied from the entering
to the trailing edge the greatest thickness should be
towards the former.) The convex surface of the propeller
must be taken into account, in fact, it is no less important
than the concave, and the entire surface must be given a
true "stream line" form.





Fig. 28.
Fig. 29.




If the entering and trailing edge be not both straight,
but one be curved as in Fig. 28, then the straight edge[65]
must be made the trailing edge. And if both be curved
as in Fig. 29, then the concave edge must be the trailing
edge.

§ 19. Propeller Design.&mdash;To design a propeller, proceed
as follows. Suppose the diameter 14 in. and the pitch
three times the diameter, i.e. 52 in. (See Fig. 30.)

Take one-quarter scale, say. Draw a centre line A B of
convenient length, set of half the pitch 52 in.&mdash; &frac14; scale
= 5&frac14; in. = C - D. Draw lines through C and D at right
angles to C D.

With a radius equal to half the diameter (i.e. in this
case 1&frac34; in.) of the propeller, describe a semicircle E B F
and complete the parallelogram F H G E. Divide the semicircle
into a number of equal parts; twelve is a convenient
number to take, then each division subtends an angle of
15° at the centre D.

Divide one of the sides E G into the same number of
equal parts (twelve) as shown. Through these points draw
lines parallel to F E or H G.

And through the twelve points of division on the semicircle
draw lines parallel to F H or E G as shown. The line
drawn through the successive intersections of these lines is
the path of the tip of the blade through half a revolution,
viz. the line H S O T E.

S O T X gives the angle at the tip of the blades = 44°.

Let the shape of the blade be rectangular with rounded
corners, and let the breadth at the tip be twice that at the
boss.

Then the area (neglecting the rounded off corners) is
10&frac12; sq. in.



Fig. 30.&mdash;Propeller Design.
One quarter scale. Diameter 14 in. Pitch 52 in. Angle at tip 44°.


The area being that of a rectangle 7 in. × 1 in. = 7 sq.
in. plus area of two triangles, base &frac12; in., height 7 in. Now
area of triangle = half base × height. Therefore area of
[67]both triangles = &frac12; in. × 7 in. = 3&frac12; sq. in. Now the area
of the disc swept out by the propeller is


&#960;/4 × (diam.)2  (&#960; = 22/7)




Fig. 31.&mdash;Propeller Design.

Scale one-eighth for A B and B C; but sections of blade
are full-sized.


And if d A r = the "disc area ratio" we have


(d A r) × &#960;/4 × (14)2 = area of blade = 10&frac12;,


whence d A r = 0·07 about.





Fig. 32.
Fig. 33.




[69]

In Fig. 31 set off A B equal to the pitch of the propeller
(42 in.), one-eighth scale. Set off B C at right angles to
A B and equal to


&#960; × diameter = 22/7 × 14 = 44 in. to scale 5&frac12; in.


Divide B C into a convenient number of equal parts in
the figure; five only are taken, D, E, F, G, H; join A D,
A E, A F, A G, A H and produce them; mark off distances
P O, S R, Y T ... equal to the width of the blade at these
points (H P = H O; G S = G R ...) and sketch in the
sections of blade as desired. In the figure the greatest
concavity of the blade is supposed to be one-third the
distances P O, S R ... from PS.... The concavity is
somewhat exaggerated. The angles A H B, A G B, A F B
... represent the pitch angle at the points H, G, F ... of
the blade.

Similarly any other design may be dealt with; in a propeller
of 14 in. diameter the diameter of the "boss" should
not be more than 10/16 in.

§ 20. Experiments with Propellers.&mdash;The propeller
design shown in Figs. 32 and 33, due to Mr. G. de
Havilland,[35] is one very suitable for experimental purposes.
A single tube passing through a T-shaped boss forms the
arms. On the back of the metal blade are riveted four
metallic clips; these clips being tightened round the arm by
countersunk screws in the face of the blade.

The tube and clips, etc., are all contained with the back
covering of the blade, as shown in Fig. 35, if desired, the
blade then practically resembling a wooden propeller. The
construction, it will be noticed, allows of the blade being set[70]
at any angle, constant or otherwise; also the pitch can be
constant or variable as desired, and any "shape" of propeller
can be fitted.

The advantage of being able to twist the blade (within
limits) on the axis is one not to be underestimated in
experimental work.



Fig. 34.&mdash;The Author's Propeller Testing Apparatus.


With a view to ascertain some practical and reliable
data with respect to the dynamic, or actual thrust given when
moving through free air at the velocity of actual travel,
the author experimented with the apparatus illustrated in
Figs. 34 and 35, which is so simple and obvious as to
require scarcely any explanation.

The wires were of steel, length not quite 150 ft., fitted
with wire strainers for equalising tension, and absolutely[71]
free from "kinks." As shown most plainly in Fig. 35,
there were two parallel wires sufficiently far apart for the
action of one propeller not to affect the other. Calling
these two wires A and B, and two propellers x and y, then
x is first tried on A and y on B. Results carefully noted.



Fig. 35.&mdash;Propeller Testing.

Showing distance separating the two wires.


Then x is tried on B and y on A, and the results again
carefully noted. If the results confirm one another, the
power used in both cases being the same, well and good; if
not, adjustments, etc., are made in the apparatus until satisfactory
results are obtained. This was done when the
propellers "raced" one against the other. At other times
one wire only was made use of, and the time and distance
traversed was noted in each case. Propellers were driven[72]
through smoke, and with silk threads tied to a light framework
slightly larger than their disc area circumference.
Results of great interest were arrived at. These results
have been assumed in much that has been said in the foregoing
paragraphs.



Fig. 36.&mdash;One Group of Propellers Tested by
the Author.


Briefly put, these results showed:&mdash;

1. The inefficiency of a propeller of the fan blower or
of the static thrust type.

2. The advantage of using propellers having hollow-faced
blades and large diameter.

3. That diameter was more useful than blade area, i.e.
given a certain quantity (weight) of wood, make a long
thin blade and not a shorter one of more blade area&mdash;blade
area, i.e., as proportionate to its corresponding disc area.[73]

4. That the propeller surface should be of true stream-line
form.

5. That it should act on a cylinder and not tubes of air.

6. That a correctly designed and proportioned propeller
was just as efficacious in a small size of 9 in. to 28 in. as a
full-sized propeller on a full-sized machine.



Fig. 37.&mdash;An Efficient Propeller, but rather Heavy.

Ball bearings, old and new. Note difference in sizes and
weights. Propeller, 14 in. diam.; weight 36 grammes.


A propeller of the static-thrust type was, of course,
"first off," sometimes 10 ft. or 12 ft. ahead, or even more;
but the correctly designed propeller gradually gathered up
speed and acceleration, just as the other fell off and lost
it, and finally the "dynamic" finished along its corresponding
wire far ahead of the "static," sometimes twice as far,
sometimes six times. "Freak" propellers were simply not
in it.



Fig. 38.&mdash;&quot;Venna&quot; Propeller.

A 20 per cent. more efficient propeller than that shown in
Fig. 41; 14 per cent. lighter; 6 per cent. better in
dynamic thrust&mdash;14 in. diam.; weight 31 grammes.




Metal propellers of constant angle, as well as wooden[74]
ones of uniform (constant) pitch, were tested; the former
gave good results, but not so good as the latter.

The best angle of pitch (at the tip) was found to be
from 20° to 30°.

In all cases when the slip was as low as 25 per cent., or
even somewhat less, nearly 20 per cent., a distinct "back
current" of air was given out by the screw. This "slip
stream," as it is caused, is absolutely necessary for efficiency.

§ 21. Fabric-covered screws did not give very efficient
results; the only point in their use on model aeroplanes is
their extreme lightness. Two such propellers of 6 in.
diameter can be made to weigh less than 1/5 oz. the pair; but
wooden propellers (built-up principle) have been made 5 in.
diameter and 1/12 oz. in weight.

§ 22. Further experiments were made with twin screws
mounted on model aeroplanes. In one case two propellers,
both turning in the same direction, were mounted (without
any compensatory adjustment for torque) on a model, total
weight 1&frac12; lb. Diameter of each propeller 14 in.; angle of
blade at tip 25°. The result was several good flights&mdash;the
model (see Fig. 49c) was slightly unsteady across the wind,
that was all.

In another experiment two propellers of same diameter,
pitch, etc., but of shape similar to those shown in Figs. 28
and 29, were tried as twin propellers on the same machine.
The rubber motors were of equal weight and strength.

The model described circled to the right or left according
to the position of the curved-shaped propeller, whether
on the left or right hand, thereby showing its superiority in
dynamic thrust. Various alterations were made, but always
with the same result. These experiments have since been
confirmed, and there seems no doubt that the double-curved
shaped blade is superior. (See Fig. 39.)[75]

§ 23. The Fleming-Williams Propeller.&mdash;A
chapter on propellers would scarcely be complete without a
reference to the propeller used on a machine claiming a
record of over a quarter of a mile. This form of propeller,
shown in the group in Fig. 36 (top right hand), was found
by the writer to be extremely deficient in dynamic thrust,
giving the worst result of any shown there.



Fig. 39.&mdash;Curved Double Propeller.

The most efficient type yet tested by the writer, when the
blade is made hollow-faced. When given to the writer
to test it was flat-faced on one side.





Fig. 40.&mdash;The Fleming-Williams Model.


It possesses large blade area, large pitch angle&mdash;more
than 45° at the tip&mdash;and large diameter. These do not
combine to propeller efficiency or to efficient dynamic thrust;
but they do, of course, combine to give the propeller a very
slow rotational velocity. Provided they give sufficient
thrust to cause the model to move through the air at a
velocity capable of sustaining it, a long flight may result,[76]
not really owing to true efficiency on the part of the propellers,[36]
but owing to the check placed on their revolutions
per minute by their abnormal pitch angle, etc. The amount
of rubber used is very great for a 10 oz. model, namely,
34 strands of 1/16 in. square rubber to each propeller, i.e.
68 strands in all.



Fig. 41.&mdash;The Same in Flight.

(Reproduced by permission from &quot;The Aero.&quot;)


On the score of efficiency, when it is desired to make a
limited number of turns give the longest flight (which is the
problem one always has to face when using a rubber motor)
it is better to make use of an abnormal diameter, say, more
than half the span, and using a tip pitch angle of 25°, than
to make use of an abnormal tip pitch 45° and more, and
large blade area. In a large pitch angle so much energy is
wasted, not in dynamic thrust, but in transverse upsetting
torque. On no propeller out of dozens and dozens that I[77]
have tested have I ever found a tip-pitch of more than 35°
give a good dynamic thrust; and for length of flight
velocity due to dynamic thrust must be given due weight,
as well as the duration of running down of the rubber
motor.

§ 24. Of built up or carved out and twisted wooden
propellers, the former give the better result; the latter have
an advantage, however, in sometimes weighing less.

CHAPTER VI.

THE QUESTION OF SUSTENTATION
THE CENTRE OF PRESSURE.


§ 1. Passing on now to the study of an aeroplane actually
in the air, there are two forces acting on it, the upward
lift due to the air (i.e. to the movement of the aeroplane
supposed to be continually advancing on to fresh, undisturbed
virgin air), and the force due to the weight acting
vertically downwards. We can consider the resultant of all
the upward sustaining forces as acting at a single point&mdash;that
point is called the "Centre of Pressure."

Suppose A B a vertical section of a flat aerofoil, inclined
at a small angle a to the horizon C, the point of application
of the resultant upward 'lift,' D the point through which
the weight acts vertically downwards. Omitting for the
moment the action of propulsion, if these two forces balance
there will be equilibrium; but to do this they must pass
through the same point, but as the angle of inclination
varies, so does the centre of pressure, and some means must
be employed whereby if C and D coincide at a certain angle
the aeroplane will come back to the correct angle of balance
if the latter be altered.

In a model the means must be automatic. Automatic
stability depends for its action upon the movement of the
centre of pressure when the angle of incidence varies. When
the angle of incidence increases the centre of pressure moves
backwards towards the rear of the aerofoil, and vice versa.[79]

Let us take the case when steady flight is in progress and
C and D are coincident, suppose the velocity of the wind
suddenly to increase&mdash;increased lifting effect is at once
the result, and the fore part of the machine rises, i.e. the
angle of incidence increases and the centre of pressure moves
back to some point in the rear of C D. The weight is now
clearly trying to pull the nose of the aeroplane down, and
the "lift" tending to raise the tail. The result being an
alteration of the angle of incidence, or angle of attack as it
is called, until it resumes its original position of equilibrium.
A drop in the wind causes exactly an opposite effect.



Fig. 42.


§ 2. The danger lies in "oscillations" being set up in the
line of flight due to changes in the position of the centre of
pressure. Hence the device of an elevator or horizontal
tail for the purpose of damping out such oscillations.

§ 3. But the aerofoil surface is not flat, owing to the
increased "lift" given by arched surfaces, and a much more
complicated set of phenomena then takes place, the centre
of pressure moving forward until a certain critical angle of[80]
incidence is reached, and after this a reversal takes place, the
centre of pressure then actually moving backwards.

The problem then consists in ascertaining the most
efficient aerocurve to give the greatest "lift" with the least
"drift," and, having found it, to investigate again experimentally
the movements of the centre of pressure at varying
angles, and especially to determine at what angle (about) this
"reversal" takes place.



Fig. 43.


§ 4. Natural automatic stability (the only one possible so
far as models are concerned) necessitates permanent or a
permanently recurring coincidence (to coin a phrase) of the
centre of gravity and the centre of pressure: the former is,
of course, totally unaffected by the vagaries of the latter,
any shifting of which produces a couple tending to destroy
equilibrium.

§ 5. As to the best form of camber (for full sized machine)
possibly more is known on this point than on any other in
the whole of aeronautics.[81]

In Figs. 44 and 45 are given two very efficient forms of
cambered surfaces for models.



Fig. 44.&mdash;An Efficient Form of Camber.
B D Maximum Altitude. A C Chord.
Ratio of B D: A C :: 1:17. A D 1/3 of A C.






Fig. 45.&mdash;Another Efficient Form.
Ratio of B D to A C 1 to 17. AD rather more than &frac14; of A C.


The next question, after having decided the question of
aerocurve, or curvature of the planes, is at what angle to
set the cambered surface to the line of flight. This brings
us to the question of the&mdash;

§ 6. Dipping Front Edge.&mdash;The leading or front
edge is not tangential to the line of flight, but to a relative
upward wind. It is what is known as the "cyclic up-current,"
which exists in the neighbourhood of the entering edge.
Now, as we have stated before, it is of paramount importance
that the aerofoil should receive the air with as little shock
as possible, and since this up-current does really exist to do
this, it must travel through the air with a dipping front
edge. The "relative wind" (the only one with which we
are concerned) is thereby met tangentially, and as it moves
onward through the air the cambered surface (or aerocurve)
gradually transforms this upward trend into a downward
wake, and since by Newton's law, "Action and reaction[82]
are equal and opposite," we have an equal and opposite
upward reaction.

We now know that the top (or convex side) of the cambered
surface is practically almost as important as the underneath
or concave side in bringing this result about.

The exact amount of "dipping edge," and the exact
angle at which the chord of the aerocurve, or cambered
surface, should be set to the line of flight&mdash;whether at a
positive angle, at no angle, or at a negative angle&mdash;is one
best determined by experiment on the model in question.



Fig. 46.


But if at any angle, that angle either way should be a very
small one. If you wish to be very scientific you can give
the underside of the front edge a negative angle of 5° to 7°
for about one-eighth of the total length of the section, after
that a positive angle, gradually increasing until you finally
finish up at the trailing edge with one of 4°. Also, the
form of cambered surface should be a paraboloid&mdash;not arc
or arc of circles. The writer does not recommend such an
angle, but prefers an attitude similar to that adopted in the
Wright machine, as in Fig. 47.

§ 7. Apart from the attitude of the aerocurve: the greatest
depth of the camber should be at one-third of the length of the[83]
section from the front edge, and the total depth measured from
the top surface to the chord at this point should not be more
than one-seventeenth of the length of section.

§ 8. It is the greatest mistake in model aeroplanes to
make the camber otherwise than very slight (in the case of
surfaced aerofoils the resistance is much increased), and
aerofoils with anything but a very slight arch are liable to
be very unstable, for the aerocurve has always a decided
tendency to "follow its own curve."



Fig. 47.&mdash;Attitude of Wright Machine.


The nature of the aerocurve, its area, the angle of inclination
of its chord to the line of flight, its altitude, etc.,
are not the only important matters one must consider in the
case of the aerofoil, we must also consider&mdash;

§ 9. Its Aspect Ratio, i.e. the ratio of the span
(length) of the aerofoil to the chord&mdash;usually expressed by
span/chord. In the Farman machine this ratio is 5·4;
Blériot, 4·3; Short, 6 to 7·5; Roe triplane, 7·5; a Clark
flyer, 9·6.

Now the higher the aspect ratio the greater should be
the efficiency. Air escaping by the sides represents loss, and
the length of the sides should be kept short. A broader
aerofoil means a steeper angle of inclination, less stability,
unnecessary waste of power, and is totally unsuited for a
model&mdash;to say nothing of a full-sized machine.

In models this aspect ratio may with advantage be given
a higher value than in full-sized machines, where it is well
known a practical safe constructional limit is reached long[84]
before theory suggests the limit. The difficulty consists
in constructing models having a very high aspect ratio, and
yet possessing sufficient strength and lightness for successful
flight. It is in such a case as this where the skill and
ingenuity of the designer and builder come in.

It is this very question of aspect ratio which has given
us the monoplane, the biplane, and the triplane. A biplane
has a higher aspect ratio than a monoplane, and a triplane
(see above) a higher ratio still.

It will be noticed the Clark model given has a considerably
higher aspect ratio, viz. 9·6. And even this can
be exceeded.

An aspect ratio of 10:1 or even 12:1 should be used if
possible.[37]

§ 10. Constant or Varying Camber.&mdash;Some model
makers vary the camber of their aerofoils, making them
almost flat in some parts, with considerable camber in others;
the tendency in some cases being to flatten the central portions
of the aerofoil, and with increasing camber towards the
tips. In others the opposite is done. The writer has made
a number of experiments on this subject, but cannot say he
has arrived at any very decisive results, save that the camber
should in all cases be (as stated before) very slight, and so
far as his experiments do show anything, they incline towards
the further flattening of the camber in the end portions
of the aerofoil. It must not be forgotten that a flat-surfaced
aerofoil, constructed as it is of more or less elastic materials,
assumes a natural camber, more or less, when driven horizontally
through the air. Reference has been made to a
reversal of the[85]&mdash;

§ 11. Centre of Pressure on Arched Surfaces.&mdash;Wilbur
Wright in his explanation of this reversal says:
"This phenomenon is due to the fact that at small angles
the wind strikes the forward part of the aerofoil surface on
the upper side instead of the lower, and thus this part
altogether ceases to lift, instead of being the most effective
part of all." The whole question hangs on the value of the
critical angle at which this reversal takes place; some
experiments made by Mr. M.B. Sellers in 1906 (published
in "Flight," May 14, 1910) place this angle between 16°
and 20°. This angle is much above that used in model
aeroplanes, as well as in actual full-sized machines. But
the equilibrium of the model might be upset, not by a
change of attitude on its part, but on that of the wind, or
both combined. By giving (as already advised) the aerofoil
a high aspect ratio we limit the travel of the centre of
pressure, for a high aspect ratio means, as we have seen, a
short chord; and this is an additional reason for making
the aspect ratio as high as practically possible. The question
is, is the critical angle really as high as Mr. Seller's experiments
would show. Further experiments are much needed.




[86]
CHAPTER VII.

MATERIALS FOR AEROPLANE
CONSTRUCTION.


§ 1. The choice of materials for model aeroplane construction
is more or less limited, if the best results are to be
obtained. The lightness absolutely essential to success
necessitates&mdash;in addition to skilful building and best disposition
of the materials&mdash;materials of no undue weight
relative to their strength, of great elasticity, and especially
of great resilience (capacity to absorb shock without injury).

§ 2. Bamboo.&mdash;Bamboo has per pound weight a greater
resilience than any other suitable substance (silk and rubber
are obviously useless as parts of the framework of an aeroplane).
On full-sized machines the difficulty of making sufficiently
strong connections and a liability to split, in the larger
sizes, are sufficient reasons for its not being made more use
of; but it makes an almost ideal material for model construction.
The best part to use (split out from the centrepiece)
is the strip of tough wood immediately below the
hard glazed surface. For struts, spars, and ribs it can be
used in this manner, and for the long strut supporting the
rubber motor an entire tube piece should be used of the
requisite strength required; for an ordinary rubber motor
(one yard long), 30 to 50 strands, this should be a piece
3/8 in. in diameter, and weight about 5/8 oz. per ft. Bamboo
may be bent by either the "dry" heat from a spirit lamp or
stove, or it may be steamed, the latter for preference, as[87]
there is no danger of "scorching" the fibres on the inside
of the bend. When bent (as in the case of other woods) it
should be bound on to a "former" having a somewhat
greater curvature than the curve required, because when cool
and dry it will be sure to "go back" slightly. It must be
left on the former till quite dry. When bending the
"tube" entire, and not split portions thereof, it should be
immersed in very hot, or even boiling, water for some
time before steaming. The really successful bending of the
tube en bloc requires considerable patience and care.

Bamboo is inclined to split at the ends, and some care is
required in making "joints." The ribs can be attached to
the spars by lashing them to thin T strips of light metal,
such as aluminium. Thin thread, or silk, is preferable to
very thin wire for lashing purpose, as the latter "gives" too
much, and cuts into the fibres of the wood as well.

§ 3. Ash, Spruce, Whitewood are woods that are
also much used by model makers. Many prefer the last
named owing to its uniform freedom from knots and ease
with which it can be worked. It is stated 15 per cent. additional
strength can be imparted by using hot size and
allowing it to soak into the wood at an increase only of 3·7
per cent. of weight. It is less than half the weight of
bamboo, but has a transverse rupture of only 7,900 lb. per
sq. in. compared to 22,500 in the case of bamboo tubing
(thickness one-eighth diameter) and a resilience per lb. weight
of slightly more than one half. Some model makers advocate
the use of poplar owing to its extreme lightness
(about the same as whitewood), but its strength is less in the
ratio of about 4:3; its resilience is very slightly more. It
must be remembered that wood of the same kind can differ
much as to its strength, etc., owing to what part of the tree
it may have been cut from, the manner in which it may[88]
have been seasoned, etc. For model aeroplanes all wood
used should have been at least a year in seasoning, and
should be so treated when in the structure that it cannot
absorb moisture.

If we take the resilience of ash as 1, then (according to
Haswell) relative resilience of beech is 0·86, and spruce
0·64.

The strongest of woods has a weight when well seasoned
of about 40 lb. per cub. ft. and a tenacity of about 10,000 lb.
per sq. in.



Fig. 47a.&mdash;&quot;Aeroplane Alma.&quot;
A very effective French Toy Monoplane.


§ 4. Steel.&mdash;Ash has a transverse rupture of 14,300 lb.
per sq. in., steel tubing (thickness = 1/30 its diameter) 100,000
lb. per sq. in. Ash weighs per cub. ft. 47 lb., steel 490.
Steel being more than ten times as heavy as ash&mdash;but a
transverse rupture stress seven times as high.

Bamboo in tube form, thickness one-third of diameter,[89]
has a transverse rupture of 22,500 lb. per sq. in., and a
weight of 55 lb. per cub. ft.

Steel then is nine times as heavy as bamboo&mdash;and has a
transverse rupture stress 4·4 times as great. In comparing
these three substances it must be carefully borne in mind
that lightness and strength are not the only things that
have to be provided for in model aeroplane building; there
is the question of resistance&mdash;we must offer as small a cross-section
to moving through the air as possible.

Now while ash or bamboo and certain other timbers may
carry a higher load per unit of weight than steel, they will
present about three to three and a half times the cross-section,
and this produces a serious obstacle, while otherwise
meeting certain requirements that are most desirable. Steel
tubing of sufficiently small bore is not, so far as the writer
knows, yet on the market in England. In France very thin
steel tubes are made of round, oval, hexagon, etc., shape, and
of accurate thickness throughout, the price being about
18s. a lb.

Although suitable steel tubing is not yet procurable under
ordinary circumstances, umbrella steel is.

§ 5. Umbrella Section Steel is a section 5/32 in. by
1/8 in. deep, 6 ft. long weighing 2·1 oz., and a section 3/32 in.
across the base by 1/8 in. deep, 6 ft. long weighing 1·95 oz.

It is often stated that umbrella ribs are too heavy&mdash;but
this entirely depends on the length you make use of, in lengths
of 25 in. for small aerofoils made from such lengths it is so;
but in lengths of 48 in. (two such lengths joined together)
the writer has used it with great success; often making use
of it now in his larger models; the particular size used by
him weighs 13&frac12; grammes, to a length of 25 in. He has
never had one of these aerofoils break or become kinked&mdash;thin
piano wire is used to stay them and also for spars when[90]
employed&mdash;the front and ends of the aerofoil are of umbrella
steel, the trailing edge of steel wire, comparatively thin, kept
taut by steel wire stays.

§ 6. Steel Wire.&mdash;Tensile strength about 300,000 lb.
per sq. in. For the aerofoil framework of small models and
for all purposes of staying, or where a very strong and light
tension is required, this substance is invaluable. Also for
framework of light fabric covered propellers as well as
for skids and shock absorber&mdash;also for hooks to hold the
rubber motor strands, etc. No model is complete without it
in some form or another.

§ 7. Silk.&mdash;This again is a sine qua non. Silk is the
strongest of all organic substances for certain parts of aeroplane
construction. It has, in its best form, a specific gravity
of 1·3, and is three times as strong as linen, and twice as strong
in the thread as hemp. Its finest fibres have a section of from
0·0010 to 0·0015 in diameter. It will sustain about 35,000
lb. per sq. in. of its cross section; and its suspended fibre
should carry about 150,000 ft. of its own material. This is
six times the same figure for aluminium, and equals about
75,000 lb. steel tenacity, and 50 more than is obtained with
steel in the form of watch springs or wire. For aerofoil
surface no substance can compare with it. But it must be
used in the form of an "oiled" or specially treated silk.
Several such are on the market. Hart's "fabric" and
"radium" silk are perhaps the best known. Silk weighs
62 lb. per cub. ft., steel has, we have seen, 490 lb., thus paying
due regard to this and to its very high tensile strength
it is superior to even steel wire stays.

§ 8. Aluminium and Magnalium.&mdash;Two substances
about which a great deal has been heard in connection with
model aeroplaning; but the writer does not recommend
their use save in the case of fittings for scale models, not[91]
actual flyers, unless especially light ones meant to fly with the
wind. Neither can compare with steel. Steel, it is true, is
three times as heavy as aluminium, but it has four or five
times its strength; and whereas aluminium and magnalium
may with safety be given a permissible breaking strength of
60 per cent. and 80 per cent. respectively, steel can easily be
given 80 per cent. Being also less in section, resistance to
air travel is again less as in the case of wood. In fact,
steel scores all round. Weight of magnalium : weight of
aluminium :: 8:9.

§ 9. Alloys.&mdash;During recent years scores, hundreds,
possibly thousands of different alloys have been tried and
experimented on, but steel still easily holds its own. It is
no use a substance being lighter than another volume for
volume, it must be lighter and stronger weight for weight, to be
superior for aeronautical purpose, and if the difference be but
slight, question of bulk may decide it as offering less resistance.

§ 10. Sheet Ebonite.&mdash;This substance is sometimes
useful for experiments with small propellers, for it can be
bent and moulded in hot water, and when cold sets and
keeps its shape. Vulcanized fibre can be used for same
purpose. Sheet celluloid can be used in the same way, but in
time it becomes brittle and shrinks. Mica should be avoided.
Jointless cane in various sizes is a very useful material&mdash;the
main aerofoil can be built of it, and it is useful for skids,
and might be made more use of than it is.[38] Three ply
wood, from 1/50 in. in thickness, is now on the market. Four
or five ply wood can also be obtained. To those desiring to
build models having wooden aerofoils such woods offer the
advantage of great strength and extreme lightness.[92]

Referring to Table V. (Timber) at the end of the book,
apparently the most suitable wood is Lombardy poplar; but
its light weight means increased bulk, i.e. additional air
resistance. Honduras mahogany is really a better all-round
wood, and beech is not far behind.

Resilience is an important factor. Ash heads the list;
but mahogany's factor is also good, and in other respects
superior.

Lombardy poplar ought to be a very good wood for
propellers, owing to its lightness and the ease with which it
can be worked.

Hollow reeds, and even porcupine quills, have been
pressed into the service of the model maker, and owing to
their great strength and extreme lightness, more especially
the latter, are not without their uses.




[93]
CHAPTER VIII.

HINTS ON THE BUILDING OF MODEL
AEROPLANES.


§ 1. The chief difficulty in the designing and building
of model aeroplanes is to successfully combat the conflicting
interests contained therein. Weight gives stability, but
requires extra supporting surface or a higher speed, i.e. more
power, i.e. more weight. Inefficiency in one part has a
terrible manner of repeating itself; for instance, suppose
the aerofoil surface inefficient&mdash;badly designed&mdash;this means
more resistance; more resistance means more power, i.e.
weight, i.e. more surface, and so on ad infinitum.

It is because of circumstances like the above that it
is so difficult to design really good and efficient flying
models; the actual building of them is not so difficult, but
few tools are required, none that are expensive or difficult
to use.

In the making of any particular model there are special
points that require special attention; but there are certain
general rules and features which if not adhered to and carefully
carried out, or as carefully avoided, will cause endless
trouble and failure.

§ 2. In constructing a model aeroplane, or, indeed, any
piece of aerial apparatus, it is very important not to interrupt
the continuity of any rib, tube, spar, etc., by drilling holes
or making too thinned down holding places; if such be done,
additional strength by binding (with thread, not wire), or[94]
by slipping a small piece of slightly larger tube over the
other, must be imparted to the apparatus.

§ 3. Begin by making a simple monoplane, and afterwards
as you gain skill and experience proceed to construct
more elaborate and scientific models.

§ 4. Learn to solder&mdash;if you do not know how to&mdash;it is
absolutely essential.

§ 5. Do not construct models (intended for actual flight)
with a tractor screw-main plane in front and tail (behind).
Avoid them as you would the plague. Allusion has already
been made in the Introduction to the difficulty of getting
the centre of gravity sufficiently forward in the case of
Blériot models; again with the main aerofoil in front, it is
this aerofoil and not the balancing elevator, or tail, that first
encounters the upsetting gust, and the effect of such a gust
acting first on the larger surface is often more than the
balancer can rectify in time to avert disaster. The proper
place for the propeller is behind, in the wake of the machine.
If the screw be in front the backwash from it strikes the
machine and has a decidedly retarding action. It is often
contended that it drives the air at an increased velocity
under (and over) the main aerofoil, and so gives a greater
lifting effect. But for proper lifting effect which it can
turn without effort into air columns of proper stream line
form what the aerofoil requires is undisturbed air&mdash;not
propeller backwash.

The rear of the model is the proper place for the propeller,
in the centre of greatest air disturbance; in such a
position it will recover a portion of the energy lost in
imparting a forward movement to the air, caused by the
resistance, the model generally running in such air&mdash;the slip
of the screw is reduced to a corresponding degree&mdash;may even
vanish altogether, and what is known as negative slip occur.[95]

§ 6. Wooden or metal aerofoils are more efficient than
fabric covered ones. But they are only satisfactory in the
smaller sizes, owing, for one thing, to the smash with which
they come to the ground. This being due to the high
speed necessary to sustain their weight. For larger-sized
models fabric covered aerofoils should be used.

§ 7. As to the shape of such, only three need be considered&mdash;the
(a) rectangular, (b) the elongated ellipse,
(c) the chamfered rear edge.



Fig. 48.&mdash;(a), (b), (c).


§ 8. The stretching of the fabric on the aerofoil framework
requires considerable care, especially when using silk.
It is quite possible, even in models of 3 ft. to 4 ft. spread,
to do without "ribs," and still obtain a fairly correct aerocurve,
if the material be stretched on in a certain way. It
consists in getting a correct longitudinal and transverse
tension. We will illustrate it by a simple case. Take a
piece of thickish steel pianoforte wire, say, 18 in. long,[96]
bend it round into a circle, allowing &frac12; in. to 1 in. to
overlap, tin and solder, bind this with soft very thin iron
wire, and again solder (always use as little solder as possible).
Now stitch on to this a piece of
nainsook or silk, deforming the
circle as you do so until it has
the accompanying elliptical
shape. The result is one of
double curvature; the transverse curve (dihedral angle) can
be regulated by cross threads or wires going from A to B
and C to D.



Fig. 49.




Fig. 49a.&mdash;Mr. T.W.K. Clarke's 1 oz. Model.


The longitudinal curve on the camber can be regulated
by the original tension given to it, and by the manner of
its fixing to the main framework. Suitable wire projections
or loops should be bound to it by wire, and these fastened
to the main framework by binding with thin rubber cord, a
very useful method of fastening, since it acts as an excellent[97]
shock absorber, and "gives" when required, and yet
possesses quite sufficient practical rigidity.

§ 9. Flexible joints are an advantage in a biplane;
these can be made by fixing wire hooks and eyes to the ends of
the "struts," and holding them in position by binding with
silk or thread. Rigidity is obtained by use of steel wire
stays or thin silk cord.



Fig. 49b.&mdash;Mr. T.W.K. Clarke's 1 oz. Model.
Showing the position of C. of G., or point of support.


§ 10. Owing to the extra weight and difficulties of construction
on so small a scale it is not desirable to use
"double surface" aerofoils except on large size power-driven
models.

§ 11. It is a good plan not to have the rod or tube
carrying the rubber motor connected with the outrigger
carrying the elevator, because the torque of the rubber tends[98]
to twist the carrying framework, and interferes with the
proper and correct action of the elevator. If it be so connected
the rod must be stayed with piano wire, both longitudinally
(to overcome the pull which we know is very
great), and also laterally, to overcome the torque.



Fig. 49c.&mdash;A Large Model Aeroplane.

Shown without rubber or propellers. Designed and constructed
by the writer. As a test it was fitted with
two 14 in. propellers revolving in the same direction, and
made some excellent flights under these conditions,
rolling slightly across the wind, but otherwise keeping
quite steady. Total weight, 1&frac12; lb.; length, 6 ft.; span
of main aerofoil, 5 ft. Constructed of bamboo, cane,
and steel wire. Front skids steel wire. Back skids
cane. Aerofoil covering nainsook.



§ 12. Some builders place the rubber motor above the
rod, or bow frame carrying the aerofoils, etc., the idea
being that the pull of the rubber distorts the frame in such[99]
a manner as to "lift" the elevator, and so cause the machine
to rise rapidly in the air. This it does; but the model
naturally drops badly at the finish and spoils the effect. It
is not a principle that should be copied.

Constructed by the author. Provided with twin propellers
of a modified Fleming-Williams type. This machine
flew well when provided with an abnormal amount of
rubber, owing to the poor dynamic thrust given by the
propellers.



§ 13. In the Clarke models with the small front plane,
the centre of pressure is slightly in front of the main plane.

The balancing point of most models is generally slightly
in front, or just within the front edge of the main aerofoil.
The best plan is to adjust the rod carrying the rubber motor
and propeller until the best balance is obtained, then hang
up the machine to ascertain the centre of gravity, and you
will have (approximately) the centre of pressure.

§ 14. The elevator (or tail) should be of the non-lifting
type&mdash;in other words, the entire weight should be carried
by the main aerofoil or aerofoils; the elevator being used
simply as a balancer.[39] If the machine be so constructed
that part of the weight be carried by the elevator, then
either it must be large (in proportion) or set up at a large
angle to carry it. Both mean considerably more resistance&mdash;which
is to be avoided. In practice this means the propeller
being some little distance in rear of the main supporting
surface.

§ 15. In actual flying models "skids" should be used
and not "wheels"; the latter to be of any real use must
be of large diameter, and the weight is prohibitive. Skids[102]
can be constructed of cane, imitation whalebone, steel watch
or clock-spring, steel pianoforte wire. Steel mainsprings are
better than imitation whalebone, but steel pianoforte wire
best of all. For larger sized models bamboo is also suitable,
as also ash or strong cane.

§ 16. Apart from or in conjunction with skids we have
what are termed "shock absorbers" to lessen the shock on
landing&mdash;the same substances can be used&mdash;steel wire in the
form of a loop is very effectual; whalebone and steel springs
have a knack of snapping. These shock absorbers should
be so attached as to "give all ways" for a part side and
part front landing as well as a direct front landing. For
this purpose they should be lashed to the main frame by
thin indiarubber cord.

§ 17. In the case of a biplane model the "gap" must
not be less than the "chord"&mdash;preferably greater.

In a double monoplane (of the Langley type) there is
considerable "interference," i.e. the rear plane is moving in
air already acted on by the front one, and therefore moving
in a downward direction. This means decreased efficiency.
It can be overcome, more or less, by varying the dihedral
angle at which the two planes are set; but cannot be got
rid of altogether, or by placing them far apart. In biplanes
not possessing a dihedral angle&mdash;the propeller can be placed
slightly to one side&mdash;in order to neutralise the torque of the
propeller&mdash;the best portion should be found by experiment&mdash;unless
the pitch be very large; with a well designed propeller
this is not by any means essential. If the propeller revolve
clockwise, place it towards the right hand of the machine,
and vice versa.

§ 18. In designing a model to fly the longest possible
distance the monoplane type should be chosen, and when
desiring to build one that shall remain the longest time in[103]
the air the biplane or triplane type should be adopted.[40]
For the longest possible flight twin propellers revolving in
opposite directions[41] are essential. To take a concrete case&mdash;one
of the writer's models weighed complete with a single
propeller 8&frac12; oz. It was then altered and fitted with two
propellers (same diameter and weight); this complete with
double rubber weighed 10&frac14; oz. The advantage double the
power. Weight increased only 20 per cent., resistance about
10 per cent., total 30 per cent. Gain 70 per cent. Or if
the method of gearing advocated (see Geared Motors) be
adopted then we shall have four bunches of rubber instead
of two, and can thereby obtain so many more turns.[42] The
length of the strands should be such as to render possible at
least a thousand turns.

The propellers should be of large diameter and pitch
(not less than 35° at the tips), of curved shape, as advocated
in §&nbsp;22 ch. v.; the aerofoil surface of as high an aspect
ratio as possible, and but slight camber if any; this is a very
difficult question, the question of camber, and the writer
feels bound to admit he has obtained as long flights with
surfaces practically flat, but which do, of course, camber
slightly in a suitable wind, as with stiffer cambered surfaces.

Wind cambered surfaces are, however, totally unsuitable
in gusty weather, when the wind has frequently a downward
trend, which has the effect of cambering the surface the
wrong way about, and placing the machine flat on the
ground. Oiled or specially prepared silk of the lightest
kind should be used for surfacing the aerofoils. Some form
of keel, or fin, is essential to assist in keeping the machine[104]
in a straight course, combined with a rudder and universally
jointed elevator.

The manner of winding up the propellers has already
been referred to (see chap. iii., §&nbsp;9). A winder is essential.

Another form of aerofoil is one of wood (as in Clarke's
flyers) or metal, such a machine relying more on the swiftness
of its flight than on its duration. In this the gearing
would possibly not be so advantageous&mdash;but experiment
alone could decide.

The weight of the machine would require to be an absolute
minimum, and everything not absolutely essential omitted.

It is quite possible to build a twin-screw model on one
central stick alone; but the isosceles triangular form of
framework, with two propellers at the base corners, and the
rubber motors running along the two sides and terminating
at the vertex, is preferred by most model makers. It entails,
of course, extra weight. A light form of skid, made of steel
pianoforte wire, should be used. As to the weight and size
of the model, the now famous "one-ouncers" have made
some long flights of over 300 yards[43]; but the machine claiming
the record, half a mile,[44] weighs about 10 oz. And
apart from this latter consideration altogether the writer is
inclined to think that from 5 oz. to 10 oz. is likely to prove
the most suitable. It is not too large to experiment with
without difficulty, nor is it so small as to require the skill of
a jeweller almost to build the necessary mechanism. The
propeller speed has already been discussed (see ch. v., §&nbsp;15).
The model will, of course, be flown with the wind. The
total length of the model should be at least twice the span
of the main aerofoil.




[105]
CHAPTER IX.

THE STEERING OF THE MODEL.


§ 1. Of all the various sections of model aeroplaning
that which is the least satisfactory is the above.

The torque of the propeller naturally exerts a twisting
or tilting effect upon the model as a whole, the effect of
which is to cause it to fly in (roughly speaking) a circular
course, the direction depending on whether the pitch of
the screw be a right or left handed one. There are various
devices by which the torque may be (approximately) got
rid of.

§ 2. In the case of a monoplane, by not placing the rod
carrying the rubber motor in the exact centre of the main
aerofoil, but slightly to one side, the exact position to be
determined by experiment.

In a biplane the same result is obtained by keeping the
rod in the centre, but placing the bracket carrying the bearing
in which the propeller shaft runs at right angles horizontally
to the rod to obtain the same effect.

§ 3. The most obvious solution of the problem is to use
two equal propellers (as in the Wright biplane) of equal
and opposite pitch, driven by two rubber motors of equal
strength.

Theoretically this idea is perfect. In practice it is not so.
It is quite possible, of course, to use two rubber motors of an
equal number of strands (equality should be first tested by
weighing). It should be possible to obtain two propellers of[106]
equal and opposite pitch, etc., and it is also possible to give
the rubber motors the same number of turns. In practice
one is always wound up before the other. This is the first
mistake. They should be wound up at the same time, using
a double winder made for the purpose.

The fact that this is not done is quite sufficient to give
an unequal torsion. The friction in both cases must also be
exactly equal. Both propellers must be released at exactly
the same instant.

Supposing all these conditions fulfilled (in practice they
never are), supposing also the propellers connected by gearing
(prohibitive on account of the weight), and the air quite
calm (which it never is), then the machine should and
undoubtedly would fly straight.

For steering purposes by winding up one propeller many
more times than the other, the aeroplane can generally speaking
be steered to the right or left; but from what I have
both seen and tried twin-screw model aeroplanes are not the
success they are often made out to be, and they are much
more troublesome to deal with, in spite of what some say to
the contrary.

The solution of the problem of steering by the use of
two propellers is only partially satisfactory and reliable, in
fact, it is no solution at all.[45] The torque of the propeller
and consequent tilting of the aeroplane is not the only cause
at work diverting the machine from its course.

§ 4. As it progresses through the air it is constantly[107]
meeting air currents of varying velocity and direction, all
tending to make the model deviate more or less from its
course; the best way, in fact, the only way, to successfully
overcome such is by means of speed, by giving the aeroplane
a high velocity, not of ten or twelve to fifteen miles an hour,
as is usual in built up fabric-covered aerofoils, but a velocity
of twenty to thirty miles an hour, attainable only in models
(petrol or steam driven) or by means of wooden or metal
aerofoils.

§ 5. Amongst devices used for horizontal steering are
vertical "FINS." These should be placed in the rear above
the centre of gravity. They should not be large, and can
be made of fabric tightly stretched over a wire frame, or of
a piece of sheet magnalium or aluminium, turning on a pivot
at the front edge, adjustment being made by simply twisting
the fin round to the desired angle. As to the size, think of
rudder and the size of a boat, but allow for the difference of
medium. The frame carrying the pivot and fin should be
made to slide along the rod or backbone of the model in
order to find the most efficient position.

§ 6. Steering may also be attempted by means of little
balancing tips, or ailerons, fixed to or near the main aerofoil,
and pivoted (either centrally or otherwise) in such a manner
that they can be rotated one in one direction (tilted) and
the other in the other (dipped), so as to raise one side and
depress the other.

§ 7. The model can also be steered by giving it a cant to
one side by weighting the tip of the aerofoil on that side on
which it is desired it should turn, but this method is both
clumsy and "weighty."

§ 8. Another way is by means of the elevator; and this
method, since it entails no additional surfaces entailing extra
resistance and weight, is perhaps the most satisfactory of all.[108]

It is necessary that the elevator be mounted on some kind
of universal joint, in order that it may not only be "tipped"
or "dipped," but also canted sideways for horizontal
steering.

§ 9. A vertical fin in the rear, or something in the nature
of a "keel," i.e. a vertical fin running down the backbone
of the machine, greatly assists this movement.

If the model be of the tractor screw and tail (Blériot)
type, then the above remarks re elevator apply mutatis
mutandis to the tail.

§ 10. It is of the most vital importance that the propeller
torque should be, as far as possible, correctly balanced.
This can be tested by balancing the model transversely on a
knife edge, winding up the propeller, and allowing it to run
down, and adjusting matters until the torque and compensatory
apparatus balance. As the torque varies the mean
should be used.

In the case of twin propellers, suspend the model by its
centre of gravity, wind up the propellers, and when running
down if the model is drawn forward without rotation the
thrust is equal; if not adjustment must be made till it does.
The easiest way to do this may be by placing one propeller,
the one giving the greater thrust, slightly nearer the centre.

In the case of two propellers rotating in opposite directions
(by suitable gearing) on the common centre of two
axes, one of the axes being, of course, hollow, and turning on
the other&mdash;the rear propeller working in air already driven
back by the other will require a coarser pitch or larger
diameter to be equally efficient.




[109]
CHAPTER X.

THE LAUNCHING OF THE MODEL.


§ 1. Generally speaking, the model should be launched
into the air against the wind.

§ 2. It should (theoretically) be launched into the air
with a velocity equal to that with which it flies. If it
launch with a velocity in excess of that it becomes at once
unstable and has to "settle down" before assuming its
normal line of flight. If the velocity be insufficient, it may
be unable to "pick up" its requisite velocity in time to
prevent its falling to the ground. Models with wooden
aerofoils and a high aspect ratio designed for swift flying,
such as the well-known Clarke flyers, require to be practically
"hurled" into the air.

Other fabric-covered models capable of sustentation
at a velocity of 8 to 10 miles an hour, may just be "released."

§ 3. Light "featherweight" models designed for long
flights when travelling with the wind should be launched
with it. They will not advance into it&mdash;if there be anything
of a breeze&mdash;but, if well designed, just "hover," finally
sinking to earth on an even keel. Many ingenious pieces
of apparatus have been designed to mechanically launch the
model into the air. Fig. 50 is an illustration of a very
simple but effective one.

§ 4. For large size power-driven models, unless provided
with a chassis and wheels to enable them to run along and[110]
rise from the ground under their own power, the launching
is a problem of considerable difficulty.

§ 5. In the case of rubber-driven models desired to run
along and rise from the ground under their own power, this
rising must be accomplished quickly and in a short space.
A model requiring a 50 ft. run is useless, as the motor would
be practically run out by that time. Ten or twelve feet is
the limit; now, in order to rise quickly the machine must
be light and carry considerable surface, or, in other words,
its velocity of sustentation must be a low one.



Fig. 50.&mdash;Mr. Poynter's Launching Apparatus.

[Reproduced by permission from the &quot;Model Engineer.&quot;]


§ 6. It will not do to tip up the elevator to a large angle
to make it rise quickly, because when once off the ground
the angle of the elevator is wrong for actual flight and the
model will probably turn a somersault and land on its back.
I have often seen this happen. If the elevator be set at an
increased angle to get it to rise quickly, then what is required
is a little mechanical device which sets the elevator at its
proper flight angle when it leaves the ground. Such a[111]
device does not present any great mechanical difficulties;
and I leave it to the mechanical ingenuity of my readers to
devise a simple little device which shall maintain the elevator
at a comparatively large angle while the model is on the
ground, but allowing of this angle being reduced when free
flight is commenced.

§ 7. The propeller most suitable to "get the machine off
the ground" is one giving considerable statical thrust. A
small propeller of fine pitch quickly starts a machine, but
is not, of course, so efficient when the model is in actual
flight. A rubber motor is not at all well adapted for the
purpose just discussed.

§ 8. Professor Kress uses a polished plank (down which
the models slip on cane skids) to launch his models.

§ 9. When launching a twin-screw model the model
should be held by each propeller, or to speak more correctly,
the two brackets holding the bearings in which the propeller
shafts run should be held one in each hand in such a way,
of course, as to prevent the propellers from revolving.
Hold the machine vertically downwards, or, if too large for
this, allow the nose to rest slightly on the ground; raise (or
swing) the machine up into the air until a little more than
horizontal position is attained, and boldly push the machine
into the air (moving forward if necessary) and release both
brackets and screws simultaneously.[112][46]

§ 10. In launching a model some prefer to allow the
propellers to revolve for a few moments (a second, say)
before actually launching, contending that this gives a steadier
initial flight. This is undoubtedly the case, see note on
page 111.

§ 11. In any case, unless trying for a height prize, do
not point the nose of the machine right up into the air
with the idea that you will thereby obtain a better flight.

Launch it horizontally, or at a very small angle of
inclination. When requiring a model to run along a field
or a lawn and rise therefrom this is much facilitated by
using a little strip of smooth oilcloth on which it can run.
Remember that swift flying wooden and metal models require
a high initial velocity, particularly if of large size and weight.
If thrown steadily and at the proper angle they can scarcely
be overthrown.




[113]
CHAPTER XI.

HELICOPTER MODELS.


§ 1. There is no difficulty whatever about making successful
model helicopters, whatever there may be about full-sized
machines.

§ 2. The earliest flying models were helicopters. As
early as 1796 Sir George Cayley constructed a perfectly
successful helicopter model (see ch. iii.); it should be
noticed the screws were superimposed and rotated in opposite
directions.

§ 3. In 1842 a Mr. Phillips constructed a successful power-driven
model helicopter. The model was made entirely of
metal, and when complete and charged weighed 2 lb. It
consisted of a boiler or steam generator and four fans supported
between eight arms. The fans had an inclination
to the horizon of 20°, and through the arms the steam
rushed on the principle of Hero's engines (Barker's Mill
Principle probably). By the escape of steam from the arms
the fans were caused to revolve with immense energy, so
much so that the model rose to an immense altitude and
flew across two fields before it alighted. The motive power
employed was obtained from the combustion of charcoal,
nitre and gypsum, as used in the original fire annihilator;
the products of combustion mixing with water in the boiler
and forming gas-charged steam, which was delivered at high[114]
pressure from the extremities of the eight arms.[47] This
model and its flight (fully authenticated) is full of interest
and should not be lost sight of, as in all probability being
the first model actuated by steam which actually flew.

The helicopter is but a particular phase of the aeroplane.

§ 4. The simplest form of helicopter is that in which
the torque of the propeller is resisted by a vertical loose
fabric plane, so designed as itself to form a propeller, rotating
in the opposite direction. These little toys can be bought
at any good toy shop from about 6d. to 1s. Supposing we
desire to construct a helicopter of a more ambitious and
scientific character, possessing a vertically rotating propeller
or propellers for horizontal propulsion, as well as horizontally
rotating propellers for lifting purposes.



Fig. 51.&mdash;Incorrect Way of Arranging Screws.


§ 5. There is one essential point that must be carefully
attended to, and that is, that the horizontal propulsive thrust
must be in the same plane as the vertical lift, or the only effect
will be to cause our model to turn somersaults. I speak from
experience.[115]

When the horizontally revolving propellers are driven in
a horizontal direction their "lifting" powers will be materially
increased, as they will (like an ordinary aeroplane) be
advancing on to fresh undisturbed air.

§ 6. I have not for ordinary purposes advocated very
light weight wire framework fabric-covered screws, but in a
case like this where the thrust from the propeller has to be
more than the total weight of the machine, these might
possibly be used with advantage.

§ 7. Instead of using two long vertical rods as well as
one long horizontal one for the rubber strands, we might
dispense with the two vertical ones altogether and use light
gearing to turn the torque action through a right angle for
the lifting screws, and use three separate horizontal rubber
strands for the three propellers on a suitable light horizontal
framework. Such should result in a considerable saving of
weight.



Fig. 52.&mdash;Correct Manner.

A, B, C = Screws.


§ 8. The model would require something in the nature
of a vertical fin or keel to give the sense of direction. Four
propellers, two for "lift" and two for "drift," would
undoubtedly be a better arrangement.




[116]
CHAPTER XII.

EXPERIMENTAL RECORDS.


A model flying machine being a scientific invention and
not a toy, every devotee to the science should make it his
or her business to keep, as far as they are able, accurate and
scientific records. For by such means as this, and the
making known of the same, can a science of model aeroplaning
be finally evolved. The following experimental
entry forms, left purposely blank to be filled in by the
reader, are intended as suggestions only, and can, of course,
be varied at the reader's discretion. When you have obtained
carefully established data, do not keep them to yourself,
send them along to one of the aeronautical journals. Do
not think them valueless; if carefully arranged they cannot
be that, and may be very valuable.[117]

CHAPTER XIII.


MODEL FLYING COMPETITIONS.

§ 1. From time to time flying competitions are arranged
for model aeroplanes. Sometimes these competitions are
entirely open, but more generally they are arranged by local
clubs with both closed and open events.

No two programmes are probably exactly alike, but the
following may be taken as fairly representative:&mdash;

1. Longest flight measured in a straight line (sometimes
both with and against the wind).[48]

2. Stability (both longitudinal and transverse).

3. Longest glide when launched from a given height
without power, but with motor and propeller attached.

4. Steering.

5. Greatest height.

6. The best all-round model, including, in addition to
the above, excellence in building.

Generally so many "points" or marks are given for
each test, and the model whose aggregate of points makes
the largest total wins the prize; or more than one prize
may be offered&mdash;

One for the longest flight.

One for the swiftest flight over a measured distance.

One for the greatest height.

One for stability and steering.

And one for the best all-round model.[120]

The models are divided into classes:&mdash;

§ 2. Aero Models Association's Classification, etc.

A.Models of1 sq. ft.surfaceandunder.
B."2 sq. ft.""
C."4 sq. ft.""
D."8 sq. ft.""
E."over 8 sq. ft.


All surfaces, whether vertical, horizontal, or otherwise,
to be calculated together for the above classification.

All round efficiency&mdash;marks or points as percentages:&mdash;


Distance40per cent.
Stability35"
Directional control15"
Gliding angle10"[49]



Two prizes:&mdash;

One for length of flight.

One for all-round efficiency (marked as above).

Every competitor to be allowed three trials in each
competition, the best only to count.

All flights to be measured in a straight line from the
starting to the landing point.

Repairs may be made during the competition at the
direction of the judges.[50]

There are one or two other points where flights are not[121]
made with and against the wind. The competitors are
usually requested to start their models from within a given
circle of (say) six feet diameter, and fly them in any direction
they please.

"Gliding angle" means that the model is allowed to
fall from a height (say) of 20 ft.



Fig. 53.&mdash;Model Designed and Constructed by the
Author for &quot;Greatest Height.&quot;

A very lightly built model with a very low aspect ratio, and
screw giving a very powerful dynamic thrust, and
carrying rather a large amount of rubber. Climbs in
left-handed spirals.



"Directional control," that the model is launched in
some specified direction, and must pass as near as possible
over some indicated point.

The models are practically always launched by hand.

§ 3. Those who desire to win prizes at such competitions
would do well to keep the following points well in mind.[122]

1. The distance is always measured in a straight line.
It is absolutely essential that your model should be capable
of flying (approximately) straight. To see, as I have done,
model after model fly quite 150 to 200 yards and finish
within 50 yards of the starting-point (credited flight 50
yards) is useless, and a severe strain on one's temper and
patience.

Open Competition for longest
flight. Crystal Palace, July 27.

Fig. 55.&mdash;Medal won by the
Author in the same Competition.



2. Always enter more than one model, there nearly
always is an entrance fee; never mind the extra shilling
or so. Go in to win.

3. It is not necessary that these models should be
replicas of one another. On some days a light fabric[123]-covered
model might stand the best chance; on another
day, a swift flying wooden or metal aerofoil.

Against the wind the latter have an immense advantage;
also if the day be a "gusty" one.[51]

4. Always make it a point of arriving early on the
ground, so that you can make some trial flights beforehand.
Every ground has its local peculiarities of air currents, etc.

5. Always be ready in time, or you may be disqualified.
If you are flying a twin-screw model use a special winder, so
that both propellers are wound up at the same time, and
take a competent friend with you as assistant.

6. For all-round efficiency nothing but a good all-round
model, which can be absolutely relied on to make a dozen
(approximately) equivalent flights, is any good.

7. In an open distance competition, unless you have a
model which you can rely on to make a minimum flight of
200 yards, do not enter unless you know for certain that
none of the "crack" flyers will be present.

8. Do not neglect the smallest detail likely to lead to
success; be prepared with spare parts, extra rubber, one or
two handy tools, wire, thread, etc. Before a lecture, that
prince of experimentalists, Faraday, was always careful to
see that the stoppers of all the bottles were loose, so that
there should be no delay or mishap.

9. If the rating of the model be by "weight" (1 oz.,
2 oz., 4 oz., etc.) and not area, use a model weighing from
10 oz. to a pound.

10. If there is a greatest height prize, a helicopter model
should win it.[52] (The writer has attained an altitude of
between three and four hundred feet with such.) The altitude
was arrived at by observation, not guesswork.[124]

11. It is most important that your model should be able
to "land" without damage, and, as far as possible, on an
even keel; do not omit some form of "skid" or "shock-absorber"
with the idea of saving weight, more especially if
your model be a biplane, or the number of flights may be
restricted to the number "one."

12. Since the best "gliding" angle and "flying" angle
are not the same, being, say, 7° in the former case and 1°-3°,
say, in the latter, an adjustable angle might in some
cases be advantageous.

13. Never turn up at a competition with a model only
just finished and practically untested which you have flown
only on the morning of the competition, using old rubber
and winding to 500 turns; result, a flight of 250 yards, say.
Arrived on the competition ground you put on new rubber
and wind to 750 turns, and expect a flight of a quarter of
a mile at least; result 70 yards, measured in a straight line
from the starting-point.

14. Directional control is the most difficult problem to
overcome with any degree of success under all adverse
conditions, and 15 per cent., in the writer's opinion, is far
too low a percentage; by directional I include flying in a
straight line; personally I would mark for all-round efficiency:
(A) distance and stability, 50 per cent.; (B) directional
control, 30 per cent.; (C) duration of flight, 20 per
cent. In A the competitor would launch his model in any
direction; in B as directed by the judges. No separate
flights required for C.

A useful formula for a single plane surface. P = pressure
supporting the plane in pounds per square foot, k a
constant = 0·003 in miles per hour, d = the density of
the air.

A = the area of the plane, V relative velocity of translation
through the air, and &#945; the angle of flight.

Transposing we have

AV2 = P/(2kd sin &#945;)

If P and &#945; are constants; then AV2 = a constant or
area is inversely as velocity squared. Increase of velocity
meaning diminished supporting surface (and so far as supporting
surface goes), diminished resistance and skin friction.
It must be remembered, however, that while the work of
sustentation diminishes with the speed, the work of penetration
varies as the cube of the speed.[131]

§ 15. Formula connecting Models of Similar
Design, but Different Weights.

D &#8733;&#8730;W.

or in models of similar design the distances flown are proportional
to the square roots of the weights. (Derived from
data obtained from Clarke's flyers.)

For models from 1 oz. to 24-30 oz. the formula appears
to hold very well. For heavier models it appears to give
the heavier model rather too great a distance.

Since this was deduced a 1 oz. Clarke model of somewhat
similar design but longer rubber motor has flown 750 ft. at[133]
least; it is true the design is not, strictly speaking, similar,
but not too much reliance must be placed on the above.
The record for a 1 oz. model to date is over 300 yards
(with the wind, of course), say 750 ft. in calm air.

§ 16. Power and Speed.&mdash;The following formula,
given by Mr. L. Blin Desbleds, between these is&mdash;


W/W0 = 3v0/4v +
 &frac14;(v/v0)3.


Where   v0 = speed of minimum power
W0 = work done at speed v0.
W = work done at speed v.


Making v = 2v0, i.e. doubling the speed of minimum
power, and substituting, we have finally

W = (23/8)W0

i.e. the speed of an aeroplane can be doubled by using a
power 23/8 times as great as the original one. The "speed
of minimum power" being the speed at which the aeroplane
must travel for the minimum expenditure of power.

§ 17. The thrust of the propeller has evidently to balance
the

Aerodynamic resistance                        = R
The head resistance (including skin friction) = S


Now according to Renard's theorem, the power absorbed
by R + S is a minimum when

S = R/3.

Having built a model, then, in which the total resistance

= 4/3R.
[134]

This is the thrust which the propeller should be designed
to give. Now supposing the propeller's efficiency to be
80 per cent., then P&mdash;the minimum propulsion power

= 4/3R × 100/80 × 100/75 × v.

Where 25 per cent. is the slip of the screw, v the velocity
of the aeroplane.

§ 18. To determine experimentally the Static
Thrust of a Propeller.&mdash;Useful for models intended to
raise themselves from the ground under their own power,
and for helicopters.

The easiest way to do this is as follows: Mount the propeller
on the shaft of an electric motor, of sufficient power
to give the propeller 1000 to 1500 revolutions per minute;
a suitable accumulator or other source of electric energy
will be required, a speedometer or speed counter, also a
voltmeter and ammeter.

Place the motor in a pair of scales or on a suitable
spring balance (the former is preferable), the axis of the
motor vertical, with the propeller attached. Rotate the
propeller so that the air current is driven upwards. When
the correct speed (as indicated by the speed counter) has
been attained, notice the difference in the readings if a spring
balance be used, or, if a pair of scales, place weights in the
scale pan until the downward thrust of the propeller is
exactly balanced. This gives you the thrust in ounces or
pounds.

Note carefully the voltage and amperage, supposing it is
8 volts and 10 amperes = 80 watts.

Remove the propeller and note the volts and amperes
consumed to run the motor alone, i.e. to excite itself, and
overcome friction and air resistance; suppose this to be 8[135]
volts and 2 amperes = 16; the increased load when the
propeller is on is therefore

80 - 16 = 64 watts.

All this increased power is not, however, expended on
the propeller.

The lost power in the motor increases as C2R.

R = resistance of armature and C = current. If we
deduct 10 per cent. for this then the propeller is actually
driven by 56 watts.

Now 746 watts = 1 h.p.

&#8756; 56/746 = 1/13 h.p. approx.

at the observed number of revolutions per minute.

§ 19. N.B.&mdash;The h.p. required to drive a propeller varies
as the cube of the revolutions.

Proof.&mdash;Double the speed of the screw, then it strikes
the air twice as hard; it also strikes twice as much air, and
the motor has to go twice as fast to do it.

§ 20. To compare one model with another the formula

Weight × velocity (in ft. per sec.)/horse-power

is sometimes useful.

§ 21. A Horse-power is 33,000 lb. raised one foot in
one minute, or 550 lb. one foot in one second.

A clockwork spring raised 1 lb. through 4&frac12; ft. in 3
seconds. What is its h.p.?

1 lb. through 4&frac12; ft. in 3 seconds
is   1 lb.    "       90 ft.  " 1 minute.

&#8756;  Work done is 90 ft.-lb.
= 90/33000 = 0·002727 h.p.
[136]

The weight of the spring was 6&frac34; oz. (this is taken from
an actual experiment), i.e. this motor develops power at the
rate of 0·002727 h.p. for 3&frac12; seconds only.

§ 22. To Ascertain the H.P. of a Rubber Motor.
Supposing a propeller wound up to 250 turns to run down
in 15 seconds, i.e. at a mean speed of 1200 revolutions per
minute or 20 per second. Suppose the mean thrust to be
2 oz., and let the pitch of the propeller be 1 foot. Then
the number of foot-pounds of energy developed

= 2 oz. × 1200 revols. × 1 ft. (pitch) / 16 oz.

= 150 ft.-lb. per minute.
But the rubber motor runs down in 15 seconds.
&#8756; Energy really developed is

= 150 × 15 / 60 = 37·5 ft.-lb.


The motor develops power at rate of 150/33000 = 0·004545
h.p., but for 15 seconds only.

§ 23. Foot-pounds of Energy in a Given Weight
of Rubber (experimental determination of).


Length of rubber36 yds.
Weight&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"2 7/16 oz .
Number of turns= 200.


12 oz. were raised 19 ft. in 5 seconds.
i.e. &frac34; lb. was raised 19 × 12 ft. in 1 minute.
i.e. 1 lb. was raised 19 × 3 × 3 ft. in 1 minute.
= 171 ft. in 1 minute.

i.e. 171 ft.-lb. of energy per minute. But actual time was
5 seconds.
[137]

&#8756; Actual energy developed by 2-7/16 oz. of rubber of 36
yards, i.e. 36 strands 1 yard each at 200 turns is

= 171/12 ft.-lb.
= 14&frac14; ft.-lb.

This allows nothing for friction or turning the axle on
which the cord was wound. Ball bearings were used; but
the rubber was not new and twenty turns were still unwound
at the end of the experiment. Now allowing for friction,
etc. being the same as on an actual model, we can take &frac34; of
a ft.-lb. for the unwound amount and estimate the total
energy as 15 ft.-lb. as a minimum. The energy actually
developed being at the rate of 0·0055 h.p., or 1/200 of a h.p.
if supposed uniform.

§ 24. The actual energy derivable from 1 lb. weight of
rubber is stated to be 300 ft.-lb. On this basis 2-7/16 oz.
should be capable of giving 45·7 ft.-lb. of energy, i.e. three
times the amount given above. Now the motor-rubber not
lubricated was only given 200 turns&mdash;lubricated 400 could
have been given it, 600 probably before rupture&mdash;and the
energy then derivable would certainly have been approximating
to 45 ft.-lb., i.e. 36·25. Now on the basis of 300
ft.-lb. per lb. a weight of &frac12; oz. (the amount of rubber
carried in "one-ouncers") gives 9 ft.-lb. of energy. Now
assuming the gliding angle (including weight of propellers)
to be 1 in 8; a perfectly efficient model should be capable
of flying eight times as great a distance in a horizontal
direction as the energy in the rubber motor would lift it
vertically. Now 9 ft.-lb. of energy will lift 1 oz. 154 ft.
Therefore theoretically it will drive it a distance (in yards)
of

8 × 154/3 = 410·6 yards.
[138]

Now the greatest distance that a 1 oz. model has flown
in perfectly calm air (which never exists) is not known.
Flying with the wind 500 yards is claimed. Admitting this
what allowance shall we make for the wind; supposing we
deduct half this, viz. 250 yards. Then, on this assumption,
the efficiency of this "one ouncer" works out (in perfectly
still air) at 61 per cent.

The gliding angle assumption of 1 in 8 is rather a high
one, possibly too high; all the writer desires to show is the
method of working out.

Mr. T.W.K. Clarke informs me that in his one-ouncers
the gliding angle is about 1 in 5.

APPENDIX A.



SOME MODELS WHICH HAVE WON
MEDALS AT OPEN COMPETITIONS.




Fig. 57.&mdash;The G.P.B. Smith Model.


The model shown in Fig. 57 has won more competition
medals than any other. It is a thoroughly well designed[53]
and well constructed model. Originally a very slow flyer,
the design has been simplified, and although by no means a
fast flyer, its speed has been much accelerated. Originally a
one-propeller machine, it has latterly been fitted with twin[144]
propellers, with the idea of obtaining more directional control;
but in the writer's opinion, speaking from personal observation,
with but little, if any, success. The steering of the
model is effected by canting the elevator. Originally the
machine had ailerons for the purpose, but these were removed
owing, I understand, to their retarding the speed of the
machine.

In every competition in which this machine has been
entered it has always gained very high marks for stability.



Fig. 58.&mdash;The Gordon-Jones Dihedral Biplane.


Up to the time of writing it has not been provided with
anything in the nature of fins or rudder.

Fig. 58 is a biplane very much after the type of the model
just alluded to, but the one straight and one curved aerofoil
surfaces are here replaced by two parallel aerofoils set on a
dihedral angle. The large size of the propeller should be
noted; with this the writer is in complete agreement. He
has not unfortunately seen this model in actual flight.

The scientifically designed and beautifully made models
illustrated in Fig. 59 are so well known that any remarks[145]
on them appear superfluous. Their efficiency, so far as
their supporting area goes, is of the highest, as much as
21 oz. per square foot having been carried.



Fig. 59.&mdash;Messrs. T.W.K. Clarke and Co.'s
Model Flyers.


For illustrations, etc., of the Fleming-Williams model,
see ch. v., §&nbsp;23.

(Fig. 60.) This is another well-constructed and efficient
model, the shape and character of the aerofoil surfaces much
resembling those of the French toy monoplane AL-MA (see
§&nbsp;4, ch. vii.), but they are supported and held in position by
quite a different method, a neat little device enabling the front
plane to become partly detached on collision with any obstacle.
The model is provided with a keel (below the centre of gravity),
and rudder for steering; in fact, this machine especially
claims certainty of directional control. The writer has seen
a number of flights by this model, but it experiences, like
other models, the greatest difficulty in keeping straight if
the conditions be adverse.

The model which will do this is, in his opinion, yet to
be evolved. The small size of the propellers is, of course,
in total disagreement with the author's ideas. All the same,[146]
the model is in many respects an excellent one, and has
flown over 300 yards at the time of writing.



Fig. 60.&mdash;The Ding Sayers Monoplane.


More than a year ago the author made a number of
models with triangular-shaped aerofoils, using umbrella ribs
for the leading edge and steel piano wire for the trailing,
but has latterly used aerofoils of the elongated ellipse shape.

Fig. 61 is an illustration of one of the author's latest
models which won a Bronze Medal at the Long Distance
Open Competition, held at the Crystal Palace on July 27,
1910, the largest and most keenly contested competition
held up to that date.

The best and straightest flight against the wind was
made by this model.

On the morning of the competition a flight of about
320 yards (measured in a straight line) was made on[147]
Mitcham Common, the model being launched against the
wind so as to gain altitude, and then flying away with the
breeze behind the writer. Duration of flight 50 seconds.
The following are the chief particulars of the model:&mdash;Weight,
7&frac12; oz. Area of supporting surface, 1-1/3 sq. ft.
Total length, 4 ft. Span of main aerofoil, 25 in. Aspect
ratio, 4 : 1. Diameter of propeller, 14 in. Two strand geared
rubber motor, carrying altogether 28 strands of1/16 square
rubber cord 43 in. long. The propeller was originally a
Venna, but with the weight reduced by one-third, and considerable
alteration made in its central contours. The front
skid of steel pianoforte wire, the rear of jointless cane wire
tipped; the rear skid was a necessity in order to protect the
delicate gearing mechanism, the weight of which was reduced
to a minimum.



Fig. 61.&mdash;The Author's &quot;Grasshopper&quot; Model.


The very large diameter of the propeller should be noted,[148]
being 56 per cent. of the span. The fin, high above the
centre of gravity, was so placed for transverse stability and
direction. At the rear of the fin was a rudder. The small
amount of rubber carried (for a long distance machine)
should also be noted, especially when allowing for friction
in gearing, etc.

The central rod was a penny bamboo cane, the large
aerofoil of jointless cane and Hart's fabric, and the front
aerofoil of steel wire surfaced with the same material.

FOOTNOTES:

[1] The smallest working steam engine that the writer has ever
heard of has a net weight of 4 grains. One hundred such engines
would be required to weigh one ounce. The bore being 0·03 in., and
stroke1/32 of an inch, r.p.m. 6000 per min., h.p. developed1/489000
("Model Engineer," July 7, 1910). When working it hums like
a bee.

[3] Part of this retardation was, of course, "increased resistance."

[4] Personally I do not recommend aluminium.&mdash;V.E.J.

[5] "Aeronautical Journal," January 1897, p. 7.


[6] Vide "Invention," Feb. 15, 22, and 29, 1896.

[7] Really aerofoils, since we are considering only the supporting
surface.

[8] I.e., to express it as a decimal fraction of the resistance,
encountered by the same plane when moving "face" instead of
"edge" on.


[9] If the width be not uniform the mean width should be taken.

[10] This refers, of course, to transverse stability.

[11] See ch. vi.


[12] Also there is no necessity for gearing.

[13] In his latest models the writer uses strands even three times
and not twice as long, viz. fourteen strands 43 in. long.

[14] This refers to1/16 in. square sectioned rubber.

[15] Of uniform breadth and thickness.

[16] In practice I find not quite so high a proportion as this is
always necessary.

[17] Steel pinion wire is very suitable.

[18] See Appendix.

[19] As high a pressure as 250 atmospheres has been used.

[20] There was a special pump keeping the water circulating rapidly
through the boiler, the intense heat converting some of it into steam
as it flowed. The making of this boiler alone consumed months of
work; the entire machine taking a year to construct, with the best
mechanical help available.

[21] Model Steam Turbines. "Model Engineer" Series, No. 13,
price 6d.

[22] See Introduction, note to §&nbsp;1.

[23] The voltage, etc., is not stated.

[24] Note.&mdash;Since the above was written some really remarkable
flights have been obtained with a 1 oz. model having two screws,
one in front and the other behind. Equally good flights have also
been obtained with the two propellers behind, one revolving in the
immediate rear of the other. Flying, of course, with the wind, weight
is of paramount importance in these little models, and in both these
cases the "single stick" can be made use of. See also ch. iv., §&nbsp;28.

[25] See also ch. viii., §&nbsp;5.

[26] Save in case of some models with fabric-covered propellers.
Some dirigibles are now being fitted with four-bladed wooden
screws.

[27] Vide Appendix.

[28] Vide Equivalent Inclinations&mdash;Table of.

[29] One in 3 or 0·333 is the sine of the angle; similarly if the angle
were 30° the sine would be 0·5 or &frac12;, and the theoretical distance
travelled one-half.

[30] Flat-Faced Blades.&mdash;If the blade be not hollow-faced&mdash;and we
consider the screw as an inclined plane and apply the Duchemin
formula to it&mdash;the velocity remaining the same, the angle of maximum
thrust is 35&frac14;°. Experiments made with such screws confirm this.

[31] Cavitation is when the high speed of the screw causes it to
carry round a certain amount of the medium with it, so that the
blades strike no undisturbed, or "solid," air at all, with a proportionate
decrease in thrust.

[32] In the Wright machine r.p.m. = 450; in Blériot XI. r.p.m. =
1350.

[33] Such propellers, however, require a considerable amount of
rubber.

[34] But see also §&nbsp;22.

[35] "Flight," March 10, 1910. (Illustration reproduced by permission.)

[36] According to the author's views on the subject.

[37] Nevertheless some models with a very low aspect ratio make
good flyers, owing to their extreme lightness.

[38] The chief advantage of cane&mdash;its want of stiffness, or facility
in bending&mdash;is for some parts of the machine its chief disadvantage,
where stiffness with resilience is most required.

[39] This is a good plan&mdash;not a rule. Good flying models can, of
course, be made in which this does not hold.

[40] This is in theory only: in practice the monoplane holds both
records.

[41] The best position for the propellers appears to be one in front
and one behind, when extreme lightness is the chief thing desired.

[42] Because the number of strands of rubber in each bunch will be
much less.

[43] Mr. Burge Webb claims a record of 500 yards for one of his.

[44] Flying, of course, with the wind.

Note.&mdash;In the "Model Engineer" of July 7, 1910, will be
found an interesting account (with illustrations) of Mr. W.G.
Aston's 1 oz. model, which has remained in the air for over a minute.

[45] These remarks apply to rubber driven motors. In the case of
two-power driven propellers in which the power was automatically
adjusted, say, by a gyroscope as in the case of a torpedo&mdash;and the
speed of each propeller varied accordingly&mdash;the machine could, of
course, be easily steered by such means; but the model to carry
such power and appliances would certainly weigh from 40 lb. to 60 lb.

[46] Another and better way&mdash;supposing the model constructed
with a central rod, or some suitable holdfast (this should be situated
at the centre of gravity of the machine) by which it can be held in
one hand&mdash;is to hold the machine with both hands above the head,
the right hand grasping it ready to launch it, and the left holding
the two propellers. Release the propellers and allow them a brief
interval (about half a second) to start. Then launch boldly into the
air. The writer has easily launched 1&frac12; lb. models by this means,
even in a high wind. Never launch a model by one hand only.

[47] Report on First Exhibition of Aeronautical Society of Great
Britain, held at Crystal Palace, June 1868.

[48] The better way, undoubtedly, is to allow the competitor to
choose his direction, the starting "circle" only to be fixed.

[49] Or 10 per cent. for duration of flight.

[50] In another competition, held under the rules and regulations
of the Kite and Model Aeroplane Association for the best all-round
model, open to the world, for machines not under 2 sq. ft. of surface,
the tests (50 marks for each) were:&mdash;A. Longest flight in a straight
line. B. Circular flight to the right. C. Circular flight to the left.
D. Stability and landing after a flight. E. Excellence in building
of the model.

[51] On the assumption that the model will fly straight.

[52] If permitted to enter; if not see Fig. 53.

[53] The design is patented.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
