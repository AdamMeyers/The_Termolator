<p style="text-align: center;">PRINCIPAL OF THE SCHOOL OF COOKING IN
BOSTON</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">ILLUSTRATED.<br>
</p>
<hr style="height: 2px; width: 50%;">
<p style="font-weight: bold;">PREFACE.</p>
<p>When the author wrote the Appledore Cook Book, nine years ago, she
had seen so many failures and so much consequent mortification and
dissatisfaction as to determine her to give those minute directions
which were so often wanting in cook-books, and without which success in
preparing dishes was for many a person unattainable. It seemed then
unwise to leave much to the cook's judgment; and experience in lecturing
and in teaching in her school since that time has satisfied the author
that what was given in her first literary work was what was needed. In
this book an endeavor has been made to again supply what is desired: to
have the directions and descriptions clear, complete and concise.
Especially has this been the case in the chapter on Marketing. Much more
of interest might have been written, but the hope which led to brevity
was that the few pages devoted to remarks on that important household
duty, and which contain about all that the average cook or housekeeper
cares and needs to know, will be carefully read. It is believed that
there is much in them of considerable value to those whose knowledge of
meats, fish and vegetables is not extensive; much that would help to an
intelligent selection of the best provisions.</p>
<p>Of the hundreds of recipes in the volume only a few were not
prepared especially for it, and nearly all of these were taken by the
author from her other books. Many in the chapters on Preserving and
Pickling were contributed by Mrs. E. C. Daniell of Dedham, Mass., whose
understanding of the lines of cookery mentioned is thorough. While each
subject has received the attention it seemed to deserve, Soups, Salads,
Entr&eacute;es and Dessert have been treated at unusual length, because
with a good acquaintance with the first three, one can set a table more
healthfully, economically and elegantly than with meats or fish served
in the common ways; and the light desserts could well take the place of
the pies and heavy puddings of which many people are so fond. Many
ladies will not undertake the making of a dish that requires hours for
cooking, and often for the poor reason only that they do not so read a
recipe as to see that the work will not be hard. If they would but
forget cake and pastry long enough to learn something of food that is
more satisfying!</p>
<p>After much consideration it was decided to be right to call
particular attention in different parts of the book to certain
manufactured articles. Lest her motive should be misconstrued, or unfair
criticisms be made, the author would state that there is not a word of
praise which is not merited, and that every line of commendation appears
utterly without the solicitation, suggestion or <i>knowledge</i> of
anybody likely to receive pecuniary benefit therefrom.</p>

READER</span>.</p>
<p>Dear Madame:</p>
<p>In the preparation of this book the author and publishers have
expended much time and money, with the hope that it may lessen your
cares, by enabling you to provide your household with appetizing and
healthful food, at a reasonable outlay of expense and skill. Should they
not be disappointed in this hope, and you find yourself made happier by
the fond approval of those who enjoy the food which you set before them
as a result of your use of this book, we trust you will recommend its
purchase by your friends, to the end that they may also be benefited by
it, and that both author and publisher may be recompensed for its
preparation.<br>

MARKETING.</big></big></p>
<p> Upon the amount of practical knowledge of marketing that the
housekeeper has, the comfort and expense of the family are in a great
measure dependent; therefore, every head of a household should acquire
as much of this knowledge as is practicable, and the best way is to go
into the market. Then such information as is gained by reading becomes
of real value. Many think the market not a pleasant or proper place for
ladies. The idea is erroneous. My experience has been that there are as
many gentlemen among marketmen as are to be found engaged in any other
business. One should have a regular place at which to trade, as time is
saved and disappointment obviated. If not a judge of meat, it is
advisable, when purchasing, to tell the dealer so, and rely upon him to
do well by you. He will probably give you a nicer piece than you could
have chosen. If a housekeeper makes a practice of going to the market
herself, she is able to supply her table with a better variety than she
is by ordering at the door or by note, for she sees many good and fresh
articles that would not have been thought of at home. In a book like
this it is possible to treat at length only of such things as meat, fish
and vegetables, which always form a large item of expense.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><big><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="1BEEF"></a> BEEF</span>.</big></p>
<p>Beef is one of the most nutritious, and, in the end, the most
economical, kinds of meat, for there is not a scrap of it which a good
housekeeper will not utilize for food.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> As to Choosing It.</p>
<p>Good steer or heifer beef has a fine grain, a yellowish-white fat,
and is firm. When first cut it will be of a dark red color, which
changes to a bright red after a few minutes' exposure to the air. It
will also have a juicy appearance; the suet will be dry, crumble easily
and be nearly free from fibre. The flesh and fat of the ox and cow will
be darker, and will appear dry and rather coarse. The quantity of meat
should be large for the size of the bones. Quarters of beef should be
kept as long as possible before cutting. The time depends upon climate
and conveniences, but in the North should be two or three weeks. A side
of beef is first divided into two parts called the fore and hind
quarters. These are then cut into variously-shaped and sized pieces.
Different localities have different names for some of these cuts. The
diagrams represent the pieces as they are sold in the Boston market, and
the tables give the New York and Philadelphia names for the same pieces.
In these latter two cities, when the side of beef is divided into
halves, they cut farther back on the hind quarter than they do in
Boston, taking in all the ribs--thirteen and sometimes fourteen. This
gives one more rib roast. They do not have what in Boston is called the
tip of the sirloin.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> The Hind Quarter.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia they cut meat more as is done in Boston than they do
in New York. The following diagram shows a hind quarter as it appears in
Boston. In the other two cities the parts 1 and 13f are included in the <i>fore</i>
quarter. The dotted lines show wherein the New York cutting differs from
the Boston:</p>

<p> The hind quarter consists of the loin, rump, round, tenderloin or
fillet of beef, leg and flank. The loin is usually cut into roasts and
steaks; the roasts are called sirloin roasts and the steaks sirloin or
porter-house steaks. In the loin is found the tenderloin; and a small
piece of it (about two and a half pounds in a large animal) runs back
into the rump. In Boston this is often sold under the name of the short
fillet, but the New York and Philadelphia marketmen do not cut it. Plate
No. 2 shows the fillet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="Images/Plate02.png"
 title="PLATE NO. 2. SHORT FILLET." alt="PLATE NO. 2. SHORT FILLET."
 style="width: 340px; height: 270px;"></p>
<p>Next the loin comes the rump, from which are cut steaks, roasts and
pieces for stewing, braising, a la mode and soups. Next the rump comes
the round, from which are cut steaks, pieces for a la mode, stewing,
braising and soups. The flank is cut from the loin, and used for
corning, stewing and as a roll of beef.</p>
<p>Plate No. 4 represents a loin as cut in Boston and Philadelphia, and
it and No. 3 represent one as cut in New York, if the two parts be
imagined joined at the point A. No. 4 also shows the inside of the loin,
where the tenderloin lies.<br>

 alt="PLATE NO. 3. RUMP, SHOWING END WHICH JOINS ROUND."
 style="width: 600px; height: 311px;"><br>
</div>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>The sirloin is cut in all sizes, from eight to twenty pounds, to
suit the purchaser. The end next the ribs gives the smallest pieces,
which are best for a small family. The tenderloin in this cut is not as
large as in the first and second. In cutting sirloin steaks or roasts,
dealers vary as to the amount of flank they leave on. There should be
little, if any, as that is not a part for roasting or broiling. When it
is all cut off the price of the sirloin is of course very much more than
when a part is left on, but though the cost is increased eight or ten
cents a pound, it is economy to pay this rather than take what you do
not want.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Porter-House Steaks.</p>
<p>Every part of the sirloin, and a part of the rump, is named
porter-house steak in various localities. In New York the second cut of
the sirloin is considered the choice one for these steaks. The rump
steak, when cut with the tenderloin in it, is also called porter-house
steak. The original porter-house steaks came from the small end of the
loin.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Sirloin Steaks.</p>
<p>Sirloin steaks are cut from all parts of the loin, beginning with
the small end and finishing with the rump. In New York the rump steaks
are also known as sirloin. In some places they do not cut tenderloin
with sirloin. One slice of sirloin from a good-sized animal will weigh
about two and a half pounds. If the flank, bone and fat were removed,
there would remain about a pound of clear, tender, juicy meat There
being, therefore, considerable waste to this steak, it will always be
expensive as compared with one from a rump or round. But many persons
care only for this kind, as it has a flavor peculiar to itself; and they
will buy it regardless of economy. Plate No. 5 shows a second cut of the
sirloin, with the shape of a sirloin or small porter-house steak. The
only part that is really eatable as a steak is from the base to the
point A, the remainder being flank.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Rump Steak.</p>
<p>What in Boston and Philadelphia is called rump steak is in New York
named sirloin. There are three methods of cutting a rump steak; two of
these give a very fine steak, the third almost the poorest kind. The
first two are to cut across the grain of the meat, and thus obtain, when
the beeve is a good one, really the best steaks in the animal.<br>

 alt="RUMP STEAK WITH THE GRAIN." style="width: 300px; height: 246px;"><br>
</p>
<p>Plates Nos. 6 and 7 represent these steaks. No. 6 is a long rump
steak, very fine; and No. 7 a short rump, also excellent. In both of
these there is a piece of tenderloin. In New York, No. 6 is sirloin
without bone, and No. 7 sirloin. There is yet another slice of rump that
is of a superior quality. It is cut from the back of the rump, and there
is no tenderloin in it. Plate No. 8 shows a rump steak cut with the
grain of the meat; that is, cut lengthwise. It comes much cheaper than
the others, but is so poor that it should never be bought. It will curl
up when broiled, and will be tough and dry.<br>

 title="BACK OF THE RUMP." alt="BACK OF THE RUMP."
 style="width: 400px; height: 267px;"><br>
<br>
</div>
<p>Some marketmen will not cut rump steak by the first two methods,
because it spoils the rump for cutting into roasts, and also leaves a
great deal of bone and some tough meat on hand. The price per pound for
a rump steak cut with the grain is ten cents less than for that cut
across, and yet dealers do not find it profitable to sell steak cut the
latter way. Plate No. 9 shows the back of the rump, which is used for
steaks and to roast. The steaks are juicy and tender, but do not contain
any tenderloin.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img
 src="Images/Plate10And11.png"
 title="AITCHBONE    ROUND OF BEEF" alt="AITCHBONE    ROUND OF BEEF"
 style="width: 600px; height: 311px;"></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Round Steaks.</p>
<p>Plate No. 11 shows the round of beef with the aitch bone taken off;
a, a, a, a, is the top of the round, b, b, b, b, the under part, where
the aitchbone has been cut off, and c, c, c, c, the vein. Plate No. 10
is this aitchbone, which is first cut from the round, and then the
steaks are taken off.</p>
<p>The best steak begins with the third slice. The top and under part
of the round are often cut in one slice. The top is tender and the under
part tough. When both are together the steak sells for fifteen or
sixteen cents per pound; when separate, the top is twenty or more and
the under part from ten to twelve. If it is all to be used as a steak,
the better way is to buy the top alone; but if you wish to make a stew
one day and have a steak another, it is cheaper to buy both parts
together. Round steak is not, of course, as tender as tenderloin,
sirloin or rump, but it has a far richer and higher flavor than any of
the others. It should be cut thick, and be cooked rare over a quick
fire. Steaks are cut from the vein in the round and from the shoulder in
the fore quarter. They are of about the same quality as those from the
round.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Tenderloin Steak.</p>
<p>This is cut from the tenderloin, and costs from twenty-five cents to
a dollar per pound. It is very soft and tender, but has hardly any
flavor, and is not half as nutritious as one from a round or rump.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Quality and Cost.</p>
<p>We will now consider the various kinds of steak, as to their cost
and nutritive qualities. The prices given are not those of all sections
of the country, but they will be helpful to the purchaser, as showing
the ratio which each bears to the other.<br>

<p>The tenderloin, rump and round steaks are all clear meat; therefore,
there is no waste, and of course one will not buy as many pounds of
these pieces to provide for a given number of persons as if one were
purchasing a sirloin or porter-house steak, because with the
latter-named the weight of bone and of the flank, if this be left on,
must always be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>After the aitchbone and steaks have been taken from the round there
remain nice pieces for stewing and braising; and still lower the meat
and bones are good for soups and jellies. The price decreases as you go
down to the shank, until for the shank itself you pay only from three to
four cents per pound.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Sirloin.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that plate No. 4 represents a loin of beef,
showing the end which joined the ribs, also the kidney suet. No. 12
represents the same loin, showing the end which joined the rump. There
are about thirty pounds in a sirloin that has been cut from a large
beeve. This makes about three roasting pieces for a moderately large
family. The piece next the rump has the largest tenderloin and is,
therefore, by many considered the choicest. Steaks cut from it are now
served in the principal hotels as porter-house.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> The Rump.</p>
<p>In plate No. 3 was shown that part of the ramp which joins the
round. Plate No. 13 represents the end which joins the sirloin.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Ribs.</span></p>
<p>Plate No. 14 represents the first five ribs cut from the back half
where it joins the tip of the sirloin, and shows the end that joined.
This cut is considered the best of the rib-roasts. For family use it is
generally divided into two roasts, the three ribs next the sirloin being
the first cut of the ribs and the others the second cut.<br>

<p>Plate No. 15 represents the chuck ribs, the first chuck, or sixth
rib, being seen at the end. There are ten ribs in the back half as cut
in Boston, five prime and five chuck; We must remember that in New York
and Philadelphia there are thirteen ribs, eight of which are prime. The
first two chuck ribs make a very good roast or steak, being one of the
most nutritious cuts in the animal, and the next three are good for
stewing and braising. Many people roast them. The flavor is fine when
they are cooked in this manner, but the meat is rather tough. A chuck
rib contains part of the shoulder-blade, while the prime ribs do not. In
New York and Philadelphia the ribs are cut much longer than in Boston;
hence the price per pound is less there. But the cost to the purchaser
is as great as in Boston, because he has to pay for a great deal of the
rattle-ran or rack. It is always best to have the ribroasts cut short,
and even pay a higher price for them, as there will then be no waste.<br>

<p>The rattle-ran or plate piece is generally corned, and is considered
one of the best cuts for pressed beef. The shoulder of mutton is used
for stews, beef <i>&agrave; la mode</i>, roasts and steaks, and is also
corned. The sticking piece, commonly called the back of the shoulder,
but which is really the front, is used for stews, soups, pie meat and
for corning. The shin is used for soups, and the brisket and ribs for
corning and for stews and soups. One of the best pieces for corning is
the navel end of the brisket. The middle cut of the rattle-ran is also
corned.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><a name="1MUTTON"></a> MUTTON.</big></p>
<p>Mutton is very nutritious and easily digested. The best quality will
have clear, hard, white fat, and a good deal of it; the lean part will
be juicy, firm and of a rather dark red color. When there is but little
fat, and that is soft and yellow and the meat is coarse and stringy, you
may be sure that the quality is poor. Mutton is much improved by being
hung in a cool place for a week or more. At the North a leg will keep
quite well for two or three weeks in winter, if hung in a cold, dry shed
or cellar. Mutton, like beef, is first split through the back, and then
the sides are divided, giving two fore and two hind quarters. Diagram
No. 18 is of a whole carcass of mutton, and half of it is numbered to
show the pieces into which the animal is cut for use.</p>

</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Hind Quarter of Mutton.</p>
<p>This consists of the leg and loin, and is the choicest cut. It makes
a fine roast for a large family, but for a moderate-sized or small one
either the leg or loin alone is better. A hind quarter taken from a
prime animal will weigh from twenty to thirty pounds.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Leg of Mutton.</p>
<p>This joint is nearly always used for roasting and boiling. It has
but little bone, as compared with the other parts of the animal, and is,
therefore, an economical piece to select, though the price per pound be
greater than that of any other cut. It is not common to find a good leg
weighing under ten or twelve pounds. A leg is shown in plate No. 19.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="Images/Plate19.png"
 title="PLATE NO. 19." alt="PLATE NO. 19."
 style="width: 300px; height: 221px;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Loin of Mutton.</p>
<p>In a loin, as cut in Boston, there are seven ribs, which make a good
roast for a small family. This cut is particularly nice in hot weather.
It is not as large as a leg, and the meat is, besides, of a lighter
quality and more delicate flavor. The cost when the flank is taken off
will be about seven cents more a pound than if the loin be sold with it
on; but, unless you wish to use the flank for a soup, stew or haricot,
it is the better economy to buy a trimmed piece and pay the higher
price. When the two loins are joined they are called a saddle. Plate No.
20 shows a saddle and two French chops.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="Images/Plate20.png"
 title="SADDLE OF MUTTON AND FRENCH CHOPS."
 alt="SADDLE OF MUTTON AND FRENCH CHOPS."
 style="width: 300px; height: 309px;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Fore Quarter of Mutton.</p>
<p>In this is included the shoulder and breast. When the shoulder-blade
is taken out the quarter makes a good roast for a large family. The
shoulder is separated from the breast by running a sharp knife between
the two, starting at the curved dotted lines near the neck (shown in
diagram No. 18), and cutting round to the end of the line. The shoulder
is nice for roasting or boiling. The breast can be used for a roast, for
broths, braising, stewing or cotelettes. Rib chops are also cut from the
breast, which is, by the way, the cheapest part of the mutton.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chops and Cutlets.</p>
<p>Chops are cut from the loin. They are called long when the flank is
cut on them and short if without it. When part of the bone of the short
chop is scraped clean it is called a French chop. The rolled chops sold
by provision dealers are the long chops with the bone removed. One often
sees them selling at a low price. They are then the poor parts of the
mutton, like the flank, and will be found very expensive no matter how
little is asked.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Prices.</p>
<p>The price of mutton varies with the seasons, but a table giving the
average price may help the purchaser to an estimate of the comparative
cost of each cut:<br>

</table>
<p>When one has a large family it brings all kinds of meat considerably
cheaper to buy large pieces untrimmed, as the trimmings can be used for
soups, stews, etc.; but for a small family, it is much better to
purchase only the part you want for immediate use. Although mutton costs
less per pound than beef, it is no cheaper in the end, because to be
good it must be fat, and mutton fat, unlike beef fat, cannot be employed
for cooking purposes, as it gives a strong flavor to any article with
which it is used.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><a name="1LAMB"></a> LAMB.</big></p>
<p>Lamb is cut and sold like mutton. Being much smaller, however, a
hind or fore quarter is not too large for a good-sized family. Lamb will
not keep as long as mutton, for, being juicy, it taints more readily. It
is of a delicate flavor until nearly a year old, when it begins to taste
like mutton and is not so tender. The bones of a young lamb will be red,
and the fat hard and white. This meat is in season from May to September.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><a name="1VEAL"></a> VEAL.</big></p>
<p>The calf being so much larger than the sheep, the fore and hind
quarters are not cooked together, and for an ordinary family both are
not purchased. The animal is, however, cut into the same parts as
mutton. The loin, breast and shoulder are used for roasting. Chops are
cut from the loin and neck, those from the neck being called rib chops
or cotelettes. The neck itself is used for stews, pies, fricassees, etc.
The leg is used for cutlets, fricandeaux, stews and roasts, and for
braising. The fillet of veal is a solid piece cut from the leg--not like
the tenderloin in beef, but used in much the same way. The lower part of
the leg is called a knuckle, and is particularly nice for soups and
sauces. Good veal will have white, firm fat, and the lean part a pinkish
tinge. When extremely white it indicates that the calf has been bled
before being killed, which is a great cruelty to the animal, besides
greatly impoverishing the meat. When veal is too young it will be soft
and of a bluish tinge. The calf should not be killed until at least six
weeks old. Veal is in the market all the year, but the season is really
from April to September, when the price is low. The leg costs more than
any other joint, because it is almost wholly solid meat. The fillet
costs from 20 to 25 cents; cutlets from the leg, 30 cents; chops from
loin, 20 cents; loin for roast, 15 cents; breast, 10 to 12 cents. Veal
is not nutritious nor easily digested. Many people cannot eat it in any
form, but such a number of nice dishes can be made from it, and when in
season the price is so low, that it will always be used for made dishes
and soups.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><a name="1PORK"></a> PORK.</big></p>
<p>Pork, although not so much used in the fresh state as beef, mutton,
lamb, etc., is extensively employed in the preparation of food. It is
cut somewhat like mutton, but into more parts. Fresh young pork should
be firm; the fat white, the lean a pale reddish color and the skin white
and clear. When the fat is yellow and soft the pork is not of the best
quality. After pork has been salted, if it is corn-fed, the fat will be
of a delicate pinkish shade. When hogs weighing three and four hundred
pounds are killed, the fat will not be very firm, particularly if they
are not fed on corn. The amount of salt pork purchased at a time depends
upon the mode of cooking in each family. If bought in small quantities
it should be kept in a small jar or tub, half filled with brine, and a
plate, smaller round than the tub, should be placed on top of the meat
to press it under the brine.</p>
<p>The parts into which the hog is cut are called leg, loin, rib piece,
shoulder, neck, flank, brisket, head and feet. The legs and shoulders
are usually salted and smoked. The loin of a large hog has about two or
three inches of the fat cut with the rind. This is used for salting, and
the loin fresh for roasting. When, however, the hog is small, the loin
is simply scored and roasted. The ribs are treated the same as the loin,
and when the rind and fat are cut off are called spare-ribs. This piece
makes a sweet roast. Having much more bone and less meat than the loin,
it is not really any cheaper, although sold for less. The loin and ribs
are both used for chops and steaks. The flank and brisket are corned.
The head is sold while fresh for head-cheese, or is divided into two or
four parts and corned, and is a favorite dish with many people. The feet
are sometimes sold while fresh, but are more frequently first pickled.
The fat taken from the inside of the hog and also all the trimmings are
cooked slowly until dissolved. This, when strained and cooled, is termed
lard. Many housekeepers buy the leaf or clear fat and try it out
themselves. This is the best way, as one is then sure of a pure article.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Sausages.</p>
<p>These should be made wholly of pork, but there is often a large
portion of beef in them. They should be firm, and rather dry on the
outside.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Liver.</p>
<p>Calves' liver is the best in the market, and always brings the
highest price. In some markets they will not cut it. A single liver
costs about fifty cents, and when properly cooked, several delicious
dishes can be made from it.</p>
<p>Beef liver is much larger and darker than the calves', has a
stronger flavor and is not so tender. It is sold in small or large
pieces at a low price.</p>
<p>Pigs' liver is not nearly as good as the calves' or beeves', and
comes very much cheaper.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Hearts.</p>
<p>Both the calves' and beeves' hearts are used for roasting and
braising. The calves' are rather small, but tenderer than the beeves'.
The price of one is usually not more than fifteen cents. The heart is
nutritious, but not easily digested.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Kidneys.</p>
<p>The kidneys of beef, veal, mutton, lamb and pork are all used for
stews, broils, <i>saut&eacute;s</i>, curries and fricassees. Veal are
the best.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Tongues.</p>
<p>These are very delicate. Beef tongue is the most used. It should be
thick and firm, with a good deal of fat on the under side. When fresh,
it it used for bouilli, mince pies and to serve cold or in jelly. Salted
and smoked, it is boiled and served cold. Lambs' tongues are sold both
fresh and pickled.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><a name="1POULTRY"></a>POULTRY AND
GAME.</big></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Chickens.</p>
<p>All fowl less than a year old come under this head. The lower end of
the breast-bone in a chicken is soft, and can be bent easily. The breast
should be full, the lean meat white, and the fat a pale straw color.
Chickens are best in last of the summer and the fell and winter. The
largest and juciest come from Philadelphia.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Spring Chickens.</p>
<p>These are generally used for broiling. They vary in size, weighing
from half a pound to two and a half pounds. The small, plump ones,
weighing about one and a half or two pounds, are the best. There is
little fat on spring chickens.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Fowl.</p>
<p>These may be anywhere from one to five or six years old. When over
two years the meat is apt to be tough, dry and stringy. They should be
fat, and the breast full and soft. The meat of fowl is richer than that
of chickens, and is, therefore, better for boiling and to use for salads
and made dishes. The weight of bone is not much greater than in a
chicken, while there is a great deal more meat. Another point to be
remembered is that the price per pound is also generally a few cents
less.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Turkeys.</p>
<p>The lower end of the breast-bone should be soft, and bend easily,
the breast be plump and short, the meat firm and the fat white. When the
bird is very large and fat the flavor is sometimes a little strong.
Eight or ten pounds is a good size for a small family.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Geese.</p>
<p>It is more difficult to judge of the age and quality of a goose than
of any other bird. If the wind pipe is brittle and breaks easily under
pressure of the finger and thumb, the bird is young, but if it rolls the
bird is old. Geese live to a great age--thirty or more years. They are
not good when more than three years old. Indeed, to be perfect, they
should be not more than one year old. They are in season in the fall and
winter.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Green Geese.</p>
<p>The young geese are very well fed, and when from two to four months
old are killed for sale. They bring a high price, and are delicious.
They are sometimes in the market in winter, but the season is the summer
and fall.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Ducks.</p>
<p>The same tests that are applied to chickens and geese to ascertain
age and quality are made with ducks. Besides the tame bird, there are at
least twenty different kinds that come under the head of game. The
canvas-back is the finest in the list; the mallard and red-head come
next. The domestic duck is in season nearly all the year, but the wild
ones only through the fall and winter. The price varies with the season
and supply. A pair of canvas-backs will at one time cost a dollar and a
half and at another five dollars.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Pigeons.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of pigeons found in the market, the tame and the
wild, which are used for potting, stewing, &amp;c. Except when
"stall-fed" they are dry and tough, and require great care in
preparation. The wild birds are the cheapest. They are shipped from the
West, packed in barrels, through the latter part of the winter and the
early spring. Stall-fed pigeons are the tame ones cooped for a few weeks
and well fed. They are then quite fat and tender, and come into market
about the first of October.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Squabs.</p>
<p>These are the young of the tame pigeon. Their flesh is very
delicate, and they are used for roasting and broiling.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Grouse, or Prairie Chicken.</p>
<p>These birds comes from the West, and are much like the partridge of
the Eastern States and Canada. The flesh is dark, but exceedingly
tender. Grouse should be plump and heavy. The breast is all that is good
to serve when roasted, and being so dry, it should always be larded. The
season is from September to January, but it is often continued into
April.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Venison.</p>
<p>There should be a good deal of fat on this meat. The lean should be
dark red and the fat white. Venison is in season all the year, but is
most used in cold weather. In summer it should have been killed at least
ten days before cooking; in winter three weeks is better. The cuts are
the leg, saddle, loin, fore quarter and steaks. The supply regulates the
price.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Partridge.</p>
<p>This bird is so like the grouse that the same rules apply to both.
What is known as quail at the North is called partridge at the South.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Quail.</p>
<p>These birds are found in the market all through the fall and winter.
They are quite small (about the size of a squab), are nearly always
tender and juicy, and not very expensive. They come from the West.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Woodcock.</p>
<p>Woodcock is in season from July to November. It is a small bird,
weighing about half a pound. It has a fine, delicate flavor, and is very
high-priced.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Other Game.</p>
<p>There are numerous large and small birds which are used for food,
but there is not space to treat of them all. In selecting game it must
be remembered that the birds will have a gamey smell, which is wholly
different from that of tainted meat.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><a name="1FISH"></a> FISH.</big></p>
<p>To fully describe all the kinds of fish found in our markets would
require too much space and is unnecessary, but a list of those of which
there is usually a supply is given, that housekeepers may know what it
is best to select in a certain season and have some idea of the prices.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> To Select Fish.</p>
<p>When fresh, the skin and scales will be bright, the eyes full and
clear, the fins stiff and the body firm. If there is a bad odor, or, if
the fish is soft and darker than is usual for that kind, and has dim,
sunken eyes, it is not fit to use.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Codfish.</p>
<p>This is good all the year, but best in the fall and winter. When
cooked, it breaks into large white flakes. It is not as nutritious as
the darker kinds of fish, but is more easily digested. The price remains
about the same through all seasons.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Haddock.</p>
<p>This is a firmer and smaller-flaked fish than the cod, but varies
little in flavor from it. The cod has a light stripe running down the
sides; the haddock a dark one.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Cusk.</p>
<p>This also belongs to the cod family, and is a firm, white fish. It
is best in winter.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Pollock.</p>
<p>This is used mostly for salting. It is much like the cod, only
firmer grained and drier.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Halibut.</p>
<p>This fine fish is always good. It varies in weight from two pounds
to three hundred. The flesh is a pearly white in a perfectly fresh fish.
That cut from one weighing from fifty to seventy-five pounds is the
best, the flesh of any larger being coarse and dry. The small fish are
called chicken halibut.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Flounders.</p>
<p>These are thin, flat fish, often sold under the name of sole. Good
at all times of the year.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Turbot.</p>
<p>This is a flat fish, weighing from two to twenty pounds. The flesh
is soft, white and delicate. Turbot is not common in our market.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Salmon.</p>
<p>Salmon is in season from April to July, but is in its prime in June.
It is often found in the market as early as January, when it brings a
high price. Being very rich, a much smaller quantity should be provided
for a given number of people than of the lighter kinds of fish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Shad.</p>
<p>This is in season in the Eastern and Middle States from March to
April, and in the Southern States from November to February. The flesh
is sweet, but full of small bones. Shad is much prized for the roe.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Blue-fish.</p>
<p>This is a rich, dark fish, weighing from two to eight pounds' and in
season in June, July and August. It is particularly nice broiled and
baked.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Black-fish, or Tautog.</p>
<p>Good all the year, but best in the spring. It is not a large fish,
weighing only from one to five pounds.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> White-fish, or Lake Shad.</p>
<p>This delicious fish is found in the great lakes, and in the locality
where caught it is always in season. At the South and in the East the
market is supplied only in winter, when the price is about eighteen
cents a pound. The average weight is between two and three pounds.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Sea-Bass.</p>
<p>This fish, weighing from half a pound to six or seven, pounds, is
very fine, and is in season nearly all the year. It is best in March,
April and May.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Rock-Bass.</p>
<p>The weight of rock-bass generally ranges from half a pound to thirty
or forty pounds, but sometimes reaches eighty or a hundred. The small
fish are the best. The very small ones (under one pound) are fried; the
larger broiled, baked and boiled. The bass are in season all the year,
but best in the fall.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Sword Fish.</p>
<p>This is very large, with dark, firm flesh. It is nutritious, but not
as delicate as other kinds of fish: It is cut and sold like halibut, and
in season in July and August.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Sturgeon.</p>
<p>This fish, like the halibut and sword fish, is large. The flesh is
of a light red color and the fat of a pale yellow. There is a rather
strong flavor. A fish weighing under a hundred pounds will taste better
than a larger one. The season is from April to September.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Weak-Fish.</p>
<p>Weak-fish is found in the New York and Philadelphia markets from May
to October. In the Eastern States it is not so well known. It is a
delicate fish, and grows soft very quickly. It is good boiled or fried.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Small, or "Pan"-Fish.</p>
<p>The small fish that are usually fried, have the general name of
"pan"-fish. There is a great variety, each kind found in the market
being nearly always local, as it does not pay to pack and ship them. A
greater part have the heads and skin taken off before being sold.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Smelts.</p>
<p>These are good at any time, but best in the winter, when they are
both plenty and cheap.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Mullet.</p>
<p>There are several varieties of this fish, which is much prized in
some sections of the country. It is a small fish, weighing from a
quarter of a pound to two or three pounds. It often has a slightly muddy
flavor, owing to living a large part of the time in the mud of the
rivers.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Mackerel.</p>
<p>This fish is nutritious and cheap. It is in the market through the
spring and summer, and averages in weight between one and two pounds.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Spanish Mackerel.</p>
<p>These are larger than the common mackerel, and have rows of yellow
spots, instead of the dark lines on the sides. They are in season from
June to October, and generally bring a high price.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Eels.</p>
<p>These are sold skinned; are always in season, but best from April to
November.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Lobsters.</p>
<p>This shell-fish is in the market all the year, but is best in May
and June. If the tail, when straightened, springs back into position, it
indicates that the fish is fresh. The time of boiling live lobsters
depends upon the size. If boiled too much they will be tough and dry.
They are generally boiled by the fishermen. This is certainly the best
plan, as these people know from practice, just how long to cook them.
Besides, as the lobsters must be alive when put into the pot, they are
ugly things to handle. The medium-sized are the tenderest and sweetest.
A good one will be heavy for its size. In the parts of the country where
fresh lobsters cannot be obtained, the canned will be found convenient
for making salads, soups, stews, etc.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Hard-Shell Crabs.</p>
<p>These are in the market all the year. They are sold alive and, also,
like the lobster, boiled. Near the coast of the Southern and Middle
States they are plenty and cheap, but in the interior and in the Eastern
States they are quite expensive. They are not used as much as the
lobster, because it is a great deal of trouble to take the meat from the
shell.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Soft-Shell Crabs.</p>
<p>As the crab grows, a new, soft shell forms, and the old, hard one is
shed. Thus comes the soft-shelled crab. In about three days the shell
begins to harden again. In Maryland there are ponds for raising these
crabs, so that now the supply is surer than in former years. Crabs are a
great luxury, and very expensive. In the Eastern States they are found
only in warm weather. They must always be cooked while alive. Frying and
broiling are the modes of preparing.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Shrimp.</p>
<p>These are found on the Southern coasts; are much the shape of a
lobster, but very small. They are used mostly for sauces to serve with
fish. Their season is through the spring, summer and fall. There is a
larger kind called big shrimp or prawns, sold boiled in the Southern
markets. These are good for sauces or stews, and, in fact, can be used,
in most cases, the same as lobster. But few shrimp are found in the
Eastern or Western markets. The canned goods are, however, convenient
and nice for sauces.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Terrapin.</p>
<p>This shell-fish comes from the South, Baltimore being the great
terrapin market. It belongs to the turtle family. It is always sold
alive, and is a very expensive fish, the diamond backs costing from one
to two dollars apiece. Three varieties are found in the market, the
diamond backs, little bulls and red fenders. The first named are
considered marketable when they measure six inches across the back. They
are then about three years old. The little bulls, or male fish, hardly
ever measure more than five inches across the back. They are cheaper
than diamond backs, but not so well flavored. The red fenders grow
larger than the others, and are much cheaper, but their meat is coarse
and of an inferior flavor. Terrapin are in the market all the year, but
the best time to buy them is from November to February.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Oysters.</p>
<p>No other shell-fish is as highly prized as this. The oyster usually
takes the name of the place where it is grown, because the quality and
flavor depend very much upon the feeding grounds. The Blue-point, a
small, round oyster from Long Island, is considered the finest in the
market, and it costs about twice as much as the common oyster. Next
comes the Wareham, thought by many quite equal to the Blue-point. It is
a salt water oyster, and is, therefore, particularly good for serving
raw. The Providence River oyster is large and well flavored, yet costs
only about half as much as the Blue-point. The very large ones, however,
sell at the same price. Oysters are found all along; the coast from
Massachusetts to the Gulf of Mexico. Those taken from the cool Northern
waters are the best. The sooner this shell-fish is used after being
opened, the better. In the months of May, June, July and August, the
oyster becomes soft and milky. It is not then very healthful or well
flavored. The common-sized oysters are good for all purposes of cooking
except broiling and frying, when the large are preferable. The very
large ones are not served as frequently on the half shell as in former
years, the Blue-point, or the small Wareham, having supplanted them.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Clams.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of this shell-fish, the common thin-shelled clam
and the quahaug. The first is the most abundant. It is sold by the peck
or bushel in the shell, or by the quart when shelled. Clams are in
season all the year, but in summer a black substance is found in the
body, which must be pressed from it before using. The shell of the
quahaug is thick and round.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Scollops.</p>
<p>This shell-fish is used about the same as the clam, but is not so
popular, owing to a peculiarly sweet flavor. It is in season from
September to March, and is sold shelled, as only the muscular part of
the fish is used.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><a name="1VEGETABLES"></a> VEGETABLES.</big></p>
<p>Every good housekeeper will supply her table with a variety of
vegetables all the year round. One can hardly think of a vegetable,
either fresh or canned, that cannot be had in our markets at any season.
The railroads and steamers connect the climes so closely that one hardly
knows whether he is eating fruits and vegetables in or out of season.
The provider, however, realizes that it takes a long purse to buy fresh
produce at the North while the ground is yet frozen. Still, there are so
many winter vegetables that keep well in the cellar through cold weather
that if we did not have the new ones from the South, there would be,
nevertheless, a variety from which to choose. It is late in the spring,
when the old vegetables begin to shrink and grow rank, that we
appreciate what comes from the South.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Buying Vegetables.</p>
<p>If one has a good, dry cellar, it is economy to procure in the fall
vegetables enough for all winter, but if the cellar is too warm the
vegetables will sprout and decay before half the cold months have
passed. Those to be bought are onions, squashes, turnips, beets,
carrots, parsnips, cabbages, potatoes and Jerusalem artichokes, all of
which, except the first two, should be bedded in sand and in a cool
place, yet where they will not freeze. Squashes and onions should be
kept in a very dry room. The price of all depends upon the supply.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> When In Season.</p>
<p>Bermuda sends new potatoes into Northern markets about the last of
March or first of April. Florida soon follows, and one Southern State
after another continues the supply until June, when the Northern and
Eastern districts begin. It is only the rich, however, who can afford
new potatoes before July; but the old are good up to that time, if they
have been well kept and are properly cooked. Cabbage is in season all
the year. Beets, carrots, turnips and onions are received from the South
in April and May, so that we have them young and fresh for at least five
months. After this period they are not particularly tender, and require
much cooking. Squashes come from the South until about May, and we then
have the summer squash till the last of August, when the winter squash
is first used. This is not as delicate as the summer squash, but is
generally liked better. Green peas are found in the market in February,
though they are very expensive up to the time of the home supply, which
is the middle of June, in an ordinary season, in the Eastern States.
They last until the latter part of August, but begin to grow poor before
that time. There is a great variety, some being quite large, others very
small. The smaller are the more desirable, being much like French peas.
When peas are not really in season it is more satisfactory to use French
canned peas, costing forty cents a can. One can is enough for six
persons. When buying peas, see that the pods are green, dry and cool. If
they have turned light they have been picked either a long time or when
old.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Spinach.</p>
<p>Spinach is always in season, but is valued most during the winter
and spring, as it is one of the few green vegetables that we get then,
and is not expensive. It should be green and crisp.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Asparagus.</p>
<p>Asparagus, from hot houses and the South, begins to come into the
market in March and April. It is then costly, but in May and June is
abundant and quite cheap. About the last of June it grows poor, and no
matter how low the price, it will be an expensive article to buy as it
has then become very "woody." The heads should be full and green; if
light and not full, the asparagus will not spend well.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Dandelions.</p>
<p>The cultivated dandelion is found in the market in March, April and
a part of May. It is larger, tenderer and less bitter than the wild
plant, which begins to get into the market--in April. By the last of May
the dandelion is too rank and tough to make a good dish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Cauliflower.</p>
<p>This vegetable is generally quite expensive. It is found in the
market a greater part of the year, being now grown in hot houses in
winter. It is in perfection from the first of May to November or
December. The leaves should be green and fresh and the heads a creamy
white. When the leaves are wilted, or when there are dark spots on the
head, the cauliflower is not good.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Tomatoes.</p>
<p>The fresh tomato comes to the market from the South in April and
sometimes in March. On account of the high price it is then used only
where the canned tomato will not answer. In July, August and September
it is cheap. It comes next to the potato in the variety of forms in
which it may be served. By most physicians it is considered a very
healthful vegetable. The time to buy ripe tomatoes for canning is about
the last of August, when they are abundant and cheap. About the middle
or last of September green ones should be secured for pickling, etc. As
the vines still bear a great many that cannot ripen before the frost
comes, these are sold for this purpose.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Beans.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of green beans in the market, the string or snap
bean and the shell bean. String beans come from the South about the
first of April. They are picked in Northern gardens about the first of
June, and they last until about the middle of July. They should be
green, the beans just beginning to form, and should snap crisply. If
wilted or yellow they have been picked too long.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Shell Beans</span>.</p>
<p>Shell beans come in May, but are not picked at the North before
June. They are good until the last of September. There is a great
variety of shell beans, but the Lima is considered the best When fresh,
shell beans are dry and smooth; but if old, they look dull and sticky.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Celery.</p>
<p>Celery is found in the market from August to April, but is in its
prime and is cheapest from November to the first of March. Before the
frost comes it is slightly bitter, and after the first of March it grows
tough and stringy. Unless one has a good cellar in which to bury celery,
it is best to purchase as one has need from time to time. Celery is a
delicious salad. It is also considered one of the best vegetables that a
nervous, rheumatic or neuralgic person can take. The heads should be
close and white, and the stalks should break off crisply. Save the
trimmings for soups.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Lettuce.</p>
<p>Lettuce is found in the market all the year round, being now raised
in hot houses in winter. It then costs two and three times as much as in
summer; still, it is not an expensive salad. There are a number of
varieties having much the same general appearance. That which comes in
round heads, with leaves like a shell, is the most popular in this
country, because it can be served so handsome. There is another kind,
high in favor in Paris and in some localities in this country for its
tenderness and delicate flavor, but not liked by marketmen, because it
will not bear rough handling. The tune will come, however, when there
will be such a demand for this species that all first-class provision
dealers will keep it. The French call it Romaine, and in this country it
is sometimes called Roman lettuce. It does not head. The leaves are long
and not handsome whole; but one who uses the lettuce never wishes for
any other. Lettuce should be crisp and green, and be kept until used in
a very cold place--in an ice chest if possible.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Mushrooms.</p>
<p>Mushrooms are in the market at all seasons. In summer, when they are
found in pastures, they are comparatively (fifty or seventy-five cents a
pound), but in winter they are high priced. Being, however, very light,
a pound goes a great way. The French canned mushrooms are safe,
convenient and cheap. One can, costing forty cents, is enough for a
sauce for at least ten people. There is nothing else among vegetables
which gives such a peculiarly delicious flavor to meat sauces. Mushrooms
are used also as a relish for breakfast and tea, or as an entr&eacute;e.
In gathering from the fields one should exercise great care not to
collect poisonous toadstools, which are in appearance much like
mushrooms, and are often mistaken for these by people whose knowledge of
vegetables has been gained solely by reading. The confusion of the two
things has sometimes resulted fatally. There can hardly be danger if
purchases are made of reliable provision dealers.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Green Corn.</p>
<p>Green corn is sent from the South about the last of May or the first
of June, and then costs much. It comes from the Middle States about the
middle of July and from the Eastern in August, and it lasts into October
in the North Eastern States. It should be tender and milky, and have
well-filled ears. If too old it will be hard, and the grains straw
colored, and no amount of boiling wilt make it tender. Corn is boiled
simply in clear water, is made into chowders, fritters, puddings,
succotash, etc.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Artichokes.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of artichokes, the one best known in this
country, the Jerusalem artichoke, being a tuber something like the
potato. It is used as a salad, is boiled and served as a vegetable, and
is also pickled. This artichoke comes into the market about July, and
can be preserved in sand for winter use.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">The Globe Artichoke.</p>
<p>A thick, fleshy-petaled flower grows on a plant that strongly
resembles the thistle; this flower is the part that is eaten. It is
boiled and served with a white sauce, and is also eaten as a salad. It
is much used in France, but we have so many vegetables with so much more
to recommend them, that this will probably never be common in this
country.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Cucumbers.</p>
<p>Cucumbers are in the market all the year round. In winter they are
raised in green houses and command a high price. They begin to come from
the South about the first of April, and by the last of May the price is
reasonable. They last through the summer, but are not very nice after
August They are mostly used as a salad and for pickles, but are often
cooked. They should be perfectly green and firm for a salad, and when to
be pickled, they must be small. If for cooking, it does no harm to have
them a little large and slightly turned yellow.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Radishes.</p>
<p>There are two forms of the radish commonly found in the market, the
long radish and the small round one. They are in the market in all
seasons, and in early spring and summer the price is low. Radishes are
used mostly as a relish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chicory or Endive.</p>
<p>The roots and leaves of this plant are both used, but the leaves
only are found in the market (the roots are used in coffee), and these
come in heads like the lettuce. Chicory comes into the market later than
lettuce, and is used in all respects like it. Sometimes it is cooked.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Sweet Herbs.</p>
<p>The housekeeper in large cities has no difficulty in finding all the
herbs she may want, but this is not so in small towns and villages. The
very fact, however, that one lives in a country place suggests a remedy.
Why not have a little bed of herbs in your own garden, and before they
go to seed, dry what you will need for the winter and spring? Thus, in
summer you could always have the fresh herbs, and in whiter have your
supply of dried.</p>
<p>It is essential to have green parsley throughout the winter, and
this can be managed very easily by having two or three pots planted with
healthy roots in the fall. Or, a still better way is to have large holes
bored in the sides of a large tub or keg; then fill up to the first row
of holes with rich soil; put the roots of the plants through the holes,
having the leaves on the outside; fill up again with soil and continue
this until the tub is nearly full; then plant the top with roots. Keep
in a sunny window and you will have not only a useful herb, but a thing
of beauty through the winter.</p>
<p>For soups, sauces, stews and braising, one wants sweet marjoram,
summer savory, thyme, parsley, sage, tarragon and bay-leaf always on
hand. You can get bunches of savory, sage, marjoram and thyme for five
cents each at the vegetable market. Five cents' worth of bay-leaves from
the drug shop will complete the list (save tarragon, which is hard to
find), and you have for a quarter of a dollar herbs enough to last a
large family a year. Keep them tied together in a large paper bag or a
box, where they will be dry. Mint and parsley should be used green.
There is but little difficulty in regard to mint, as it is used only in
the spring and summer.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><big><a name="GROCERIES"></a>
GROCERIES.</big></big></p>
<p>The manner in which a housekeeper buys her groceries must depend
upon where she lives and how large her family is. In a country place,
where the stores are few and not well supplied, it is best to buy in
large quantities all articles that will not deteriorate by keeping. If
one has a large family a great saving is made by purchasing the greater
portion of one's groceries at wholesale.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Flour.</p>
<p>There is now in use flour made by two different processes, by the
old, or St. Louis, and the new, or Haxall. The Haxall flour is used
mostly for bread and the old-process for pastry, cake, etc. By the new
process more starch and less of the outer coats, which contain much of
the phosphates, is retained; so that the flour makes a whiter and
moister bread. This flour packs closer than that made in the old way, so
that a pound of it will not measure as much as a pound of the old kind.
In using an old rule, one-eighth of this flour should be left out. For
instance, if in a recipe for bread you have four quarts (old-process) of
flour given, of the new-process you would take only three and a half
quarts. This flour does not make as good cake and pastry as the
old-process. It is, therefore, well, to have a barrel of each, if you
have space, for the pastry flour is the cheaper, and the longer all
kinds of flour are kept in a <i>dry</i> place, the better they are.
Buying in small quantities is extremely extravagant. When you have
become accustomed to one brand, and it works to your satisfaction, do
not change for a new one. The <i>best</i> flour is the cheapest. There
are a great many brands that are equally good.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Graham.</p>
<p>The best Graham is made by grinding good wheat and not sifting it.
Much that is sold is a poor quality of flour mixed with bran. This will
not, of course, make good, sweet bread. The "Arlington Whole Wheat Meal"
is manufactured from pure wheat, and makes delicious bread. Graham, like
flour, will keep in a cool, dry place for years.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Indian Meal.</p>
<p>In most families there is a large amount of this used, but the
quantity purchased at a time depends upon the kind of meal selected. The
common kind, which is made by grinding between two mill-stones, retains
a great deal of moisture, and, in hot weather, will soon grow musty; but
the granulated meal will keep for any length of time. The corn for this
meal is first dried; and it takes about two years for this. Then the
outer husks are removed, and the corn is ground by a process that
produces grains like granulated sugar. After once using this meal one
will not willingly go back to the old kind. Indian meal is made from two
kinds of corn, Northern and Southern. The former gives the yellow meal,
and is much richer than the Southern, of which white meal is made.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Rye Meal.</p>
<p>This meal, like the old-process Indian, will grow musty in a short
time in hot weather, so that but a small quantity of it should be bought
at a time. The meal is much better than the flour for all kinds of bread
and muffins.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Oat Meal.</p>
<p>There are several kinds of oat meal--Scotch, Irish, Canadian and
American. The first two are sold in small packages, the Canadian and
American in any quantity. It seems as if the Canadian and American
should be the best because the freshest; but the fact is the others are
considered the choicest. Many people could not eat oat meal in former
years, owing to the husks irritating the lining of the stomach. There is
now what is called pearled meal. All the husks are removed, and the oats
are then cut. The coarse kind will keep longer than the fine ground, but
it is best to purchase often, and have the meal as fresh as possible.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Cracked Wheat.</p>
<p>This is the whole wheat just crushed or cut like the coarse oat
meal, but unlike the meal. It will keep a long time. It is cooked the
same as oat meal. That which is cut makes a handsomer dish than the
crushed, but the latter cooks more quickly.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Hominy.</p>
<p>This is made from corn, and it comes in a number of sizes, beginning
with samp and ending with a grade nearly as fine as coarse-granulated
sugar. The finest grade is really the best, so many nice dishes can be
made with it which you cannot make with the coarse. Hominy will keep a
long time, and it can be bought in five-pound package or by the barrel.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Sugar.</p>
<p>The fine-granulated sugar is the best and cheapest for general
family use. It is pure and dry; therefore, there is more in one pound of
it than in a damp, brown sugar, besides its sweetening power being
considerably greater. The price of sugar at wholesale is not much less
than at retail, but time and trouble are saved by purchasing by the
barrel.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Spice.</p>
<p>It is well to keep on hand all kinds of spice, both whole and
ground. They should not be in large quantities, as a good cook will use
them very sparingly, and a good house-keeper will have too much regard
for the health of her family and the delicacy of her food to have them
used lavishly. For soups and sauces the whole spice is best, as it gives
a delicate flavor, and does not color. A small wooden or tin box should
be partly filled with whole mace, cloves, allspice and cinnamon, and a
smaller paste-board box, full of pepper-corns, should be placed in it.
By this plan you will have all your spices together when you season a
soup or sauce.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> English Currants.</p>
<p>These keep well, and if cleaned, washed and <i>well</i> dried, will
improve in flavor by being kept.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Raisins.</p>
<p>In large families, if this fruit is much used, it is well to buy by
the box. Time does not improve raisins.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Soda, Cream of Tartar, Baking Powder.</p>
<p>There should not be so much of these articles used as to require
that they be purchased in large quantities. Cream of tartar is
expensive, soda cheap. If one prefers to use baking powders there will
be no need of cream of tartar, but the soda will still be required for
gingerbread and brown bread, and to use with sour milk, etc. The
advantage of baking powder is that it is prepared by chemists who know
just the proportion of soda to use with the acid (which should be cream
of tartar), and the result will be invariable if the cook is exact in
measuring the other ingredients. When an inexperienced cook uses the
soda and cream of tartar there is apt to be a little too much of one or
the other. Just now, with the failure of the grape crops in France, from
which a greater part of the crystals in use come, cream of tarter is
extremely high, and substitutes, such as phosphates, are being used.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> To be Always Kept on Hand.</p>
<p>Besides the things already mentioned, housekeepers should always
have a supply of rice, pearl barley, dried beans, split peas, tapioca,
macaroni, vermicilli, tea, coffee, chocolate, corn-starch, molasses,
vinegar, mustard, pepper, salt, capers, canned tomato, and any other
canned vegetables of which a quantity is used. Of the many kind of
molasses, Porto Rico is the best for cooking purposes. It is well to
have a few such condiments as curry powder (a small bottle will last for
years), Halford sauce, essence of anchovies and mushroom ketchup. These
give variety to the flavoring, and, if used carefully, will not be an
expensive addition, so little is needed for a dish.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><big><a name="CARE"></a> CARE OF FOOD.</big></big></p>
<p>A great saving is made by the proper care and use of cooked and
uncooked food. The first and great consideration is perfect cleanliness.
The ice chest and cellar should be thoroughly cleaned once a week; the
jars in which bread is kept must be washed, scalded and dried thoroughly
at least twice a week. When cooked food is placed in either the ice
chest or cellar it should be perfectly cool; if not, it will absorb an
unpleasant flavor from the close atmosphere of either place. Meat should
not be put directly on the ice, as the water draws out the juices.
Always place it in a pan, and this may be set on the ice. When you have
a refrigerator where the meat can be hung, a pan is not needed. In
winter, too, when one has a cold room, it is best to hang meats there.
These remarks apply, of course, only to joints and fowl. The habit which
many people have of putting steaks, chops, etc., in the wrapping paper
on ice, is a very bad one. When purchasing meat always have the
trimmings sent home, as they help to make soups and sauces. Every scrap
of meat and bone left from roasts and broils should be saved for the
soup-pot. Trimmings from ham, tongue, corned beef, etc., should all be
saved for the many relishes they will make. Cold fish can be used in
salads and warmed up in many palatable ways. In fact, nothing that comes
on the table is enjoyed more than the little dishes which an artistic
cook will make from the odds and ends left from a former meal. By
artistic cook is meant not a professional, but a woman who believes in
cleanliness and hot dishes, and that there is something in the
appearance as well as in the taste of the food, and who does not believe
that a quantity of butter, or of some kind of fat, is essential to the
success of nearly every dish cooked. The amount of food spoiled by
butter, <i>good</i> butter too, is surprising.</p>
<p>One should have a number of plates for cold food, that each kind may
be kept by itself. The fat trimmings from beef, pork, veal, chickens and
fowl should be tried out while fresh, and then strained. The fowl and
chicken fat ought to be kept in a pot by itself for shortening and
delicate frying. Have a stone pot for it, holding about a quart, and
another, holding three or four quarts, for the other kinds. The fat that
has been skimmed from soups, boiled beef and fowl, should be cooked
rather slowly until the sediment falls to the bottom and there is not
the shadow of a bubble. It can then be strained into the jar with the
other fat; but if strained while bubbles remain, there is water in it,
and it will spoil quickly. The fat from sausages can also be strained
into the larger pot. Another pot, holding about three quarts, should be
kept for the fat in which articles of food have been fried. When you
have finished frying, set the kettle in a cool place for about half an
hour; then pour the fat into the pot through a fine strainer, being
careful to keep back the sediment, which scrape into the soap-grease. In
this way you can fry in the same fat a dozen times, while if you are not
careful to strain it each time, the crumbs left will burn and blacken
all the fat. Occasionally, when you have finished frying, cut up two or
three uncooked potatoes and put into the boiling fat. Set on the back of
the stove for ten or fifteen minutes; then set in a cool place for
fifteen minutes longer, and strain. The potatoes clarify the fat. Many
people use ham fat for cooking purposes; and when there is no objection
to the flavor, it is nice for frying eggs, potatoes, etc. But it should
not be mixed with other kinds. The fat from mutton, lamb, geese, turkey
or ducks will give an unpleasant flavor to anything with which it is
used, and the best place for it is with the soap-grease. Every particle
of soup and gravy should be saved, as a small quantity of either adds a
great deal to many little dishes. The quicker food of all kinds cools
the longer it keeps. This should be particularly remembered with soups
and bread.</p>
<p>Bread and cake must be thoroughly cooled before being put into box
or jar. If not, the steam will cause them to mold quickly. Crusts and
pieces of stale bread should be dried in a slow oven, rolled into fine
crumbs on a board, and put away for croquettes, cutlets or anything that
is breaded. Pieces of stale bread can be used for toast, griddle-cakes
and puddings and for dressing for poultry and other kinds of meat. Stale
cake can be made into puddings; The best tub butter will keep perfectly
well without a brine if kept in a cool, sweet room. It is more healthful
and satisfactory to buy the choicest tub butter and use it for table and
cooking purposes than to provide a fancy article for the table and use
an inferior one in the preparation of the food. If, from any cause,
butter becomes rancid, to each pint of it add one table-spoonful of salt
and one teaspoonful of soda, and mix well; then add one pint of cold
water, and set on the fire until it comes to the boiling point Now set
away to cool, and when cool and hard, take off the butter in a cake.
Wipe dry and put away for cooking purposes. It will be perfectly sweet.</p>
<p>Milk, cream and butter all quickly absorb strong odors; therefore,
care must be taken to keep them in a cool, sweet room or in an ice
chest. Cheese should be wrapped in a piece of clean linen and kept in a
box. Berries must be kept in a cool place, and uncovered.<br>
<br>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><big><a name="FURNISHINGS"></a>
KITCHEN FURNISHING.</big></big></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Stove, or Range?</p>
<p>The question often arises, even with old housekeepers, Which shall
it be--a stove or a range? There are strong points in favor of each. For
a small kitchen the range may be commended, because it occupies the
least space, and does not heat a room as intensely as a stove, although
it will heat water enough for kitchen and bath-room purposes for a large
family. That the range is popular is evident from the fact that nearly
every modern house is supplied with one; and thus the cost of, and
cartage for, stoves is generally saved to tenants in these days.</p>
<p>There are these advantage of a stove over a set range: it requires
less than half as much fuel and is more easily managed--that is, the
fire can be more quickly started, and if it gets too low, more easily
replenished and put in working order; and the ovens can be more quickly
heated or cooled. But, although you can have a water-back and boiler
with most modern stoves or, as they are now called, portable ranges, the
supply of hot water will not be large. And you cannot roast before the
fire as with a range.</p>
<p>So near-perfection have the makers of ranges and stoves come that it
would be difficult to speak of possible improvements, especially in
stoves. This can be said not of a few, but of a great many
manufacturers, each having his special merit. And where the products are
so generally good, it is hard to mention one make in preference to
another. When purchasing, it is well to remember, that one of simple
construction is the most easily managed and does not soon get out of
order. No single piece of furniture contributes so much to the comfort
of a family as the range or stove, which should, therefore, be the best
of its kind.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Gas and Oil Stoves.</p>
<p>During the hot weather a gas or oil stove is a great comfort. The
"Sun Dial," manufactured by the Goodwin Gas Stove Co., Philadelphia, is
a "perfect gem," roasting, baking, broiling, etc., as well as a coal
stove or range. Indeed, meats roasted or broiled by it are jucier than
when cooked over or before coals. The peculiar advantage of oil and gas
stoves is that they can be coveniently used for a short time, say for
the preparation of a meal, at a trifling expense. The cost of running a
gas stove throughout the day is, however, much greater than that of a
coal stove, while an oil stove can be run cheaper than either.  There
are a great many manufacturers of oil stoves, and as a natural
consequence, where there is so much competition, the stoves are nearly
all good. One would not think of doing the cooking for a large family
with one or, indeed, two of them; but the amount of work that can be
accomplished with a single stove is remarkable. They are a great comfort
in hot weather, many small families doing their entire cooking with them.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Refrigerators.</p>
<p>The trouble with most refrigerators is that the food kept in them is
apt to have a peculiar taste. This is owing in a great measure to the
wood used in the construction of the interior and for the shelves. On
the inside of the Eddy chest-shaped refrigerator there is not a particle
of wood, and the food kept in it is always sweet. It is simply a chest,
where the ice is placed on the bottom and slate shelves put on top. With
this style of refrigerator the waste of ice is much greater than in
those built with a separate compartment for ice, but the food is more
healthful.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Utensils.</p>
<p>The following is a list of utensils with which a kitchen should be
furnished. But the housekeeper will find that there is continually
something new to be bought. If there be much fancy cooking, there must
be an ice cream freezer, jelly and charlotte russe moulds and many
little pans and cutters. The right way is, of course, to get the
essential articles first, and then, from time to time, to add those used
in fancy cooking:</p>

</dl>
<p> All the tin ware should be made from xx tin. It will then keep its
shape, and wear three times as long as if made of thin stuff. Scouring
with sand soon ruins tin, the coarse sand scratching it and causing it
to rust. Sapolio, a soap which comes for cleaning tins, wood-work and
paint, will be found of great value in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Granite ware, as now made, is perfectly safe to-use. It will not
become discolored by any kind of cooking, and is so perfectly smooth
that articles of food will not stick and bum in it as quickly as in the
porcelain-lined pans. Nearly every utensil used in the kitchen is now
made in granite ware. The mixing spoons are, however, not desirable, as
the coating of granite peels off when the spoon is bent. Have no more
heavy cast-iron articles than are really needed, for they are not easily
handled, and are, therefore, less likely to be kept as clean, inside and
out, as the lighter and smoother ware.<br>

<big style="font-weight: bold;"><big><a name="SOUPS"></a>SOUPS.</big></big>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Remarks on Soup Stock.</p>
<p>There is a number of methods of making soup stocks, and no two will
give exactly the same results. One of the simplest and most satisfactory
is that of clear stock or bouillon. By this the best flavor of the meat
is obtained, for none passes off in steam, as when the meat is boiled
rapidly. The second mode is in boiling the stock a great deal, to reduce
it. This gives a very rich soup, with a marked difference in the flavor
from that made with clear meat kept in water at the boiling point. The
third way leaves a mixed stock, which will not be clear unless whites of
eggs are used. In following the first methods we buy clear beef
specially for the stock, and know from the beginning just how much stock
there will be when the work is completed. By the second method we are
not sure, because more or less than we estimate may boil away. The third
stock, being made from bones and pieces of meat left from roasts, and
from the trimmings of raw meats, will always be changeable in color,
quantity and quality. This is, however, a very important stock, and it
should always be kept on hand. No household, even where only a moderate
amount of meat is used, should be without a stock-pot. It can be kept on
the back of the range or stove while cooking is going on. Two or three
times a week it should be put on with the trimmings and bones left from
cooked and uncooked meats. This practice will give a supply of stock at
all times, which will be of the greatest value in making sauces, side
dishes and soups. Meat if only slightly tainted will spoil a stock;
therefore great care must be taken that every particle is perfectly
sweet.</p>
<p>Vegetables make a stock sour very quickly, so if you wish to keep a
stock do not use them. Many rules advise putting vegetables into the
stock-pot with the meat and water and cooking from the very beginning.
When this is done they absorb the fine flavor of the meat and give the
soup a rank taste. They should cook not more than an hour--the last
hour--in the stock. A white stock is made with veal or poultry. The
water in which a leg of mutton or fowl have been boiled makes a good
stock for light soups and gravies. A soup stock must be cooled quickly
or it will not keep well. In winter any kind of stock ought to keep good
a week. That boiled down to a jelly will last the longest. In the warm
months three days will be the average time stock will keep.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Stock for Clear Soups.</p>
<p>Five pounds of clear beef, cut from the lower part of the round;
five quarts of cold water. Let come to a boil, slowly; skim carefully,
and set where it will keep just at the boiling point for eight or ten
hours. Strain, and set away to cool. In the morning skim off all the fat
and turn the soup into the kettle, being careful not to let the sediment
pass in. Into the soup put an onion, one stalk of celery, two leaves of
sage, two sprigs of parsley, two of thyme, two of summer savory, two bay
leaves, twelve pepper-corns and six whole cloves. Boil gently from ten
to twenty minutes; salt and pepper to taste. Strain through an old
napkin. This is now ready for serving as a simple clear soup or for the
foundation of all kinds of clear soups.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Mixed Stock.</p>
<p>Put the trimmings of your fresh meats and the bones and tough pieces
left from roasts or broils into the soup pot with one quart of water to
every two pounds of meat and bones. When it comes to a boil, skim and
set back where it will simmer six hours; then add a bouquet of sweet
herbs, one onion, six cloves and twelve pepper-corns to each gallon of
stock. Cook two hours longer; strain and set in a cool place. In the
morning skim off the fat. Keep in a very cool place. This can be used
for common soups, sauces, and where stock is used in made dishes. It
should always be kept on hand, as it really costs nothing but the labor
(which is very little), and enters so often into the preparation of
simple, yet toothsome, dishes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Consomm&eacute;.</p>
<p>Eight pounds of a shin of veal, eight pounds of the lower part of
the round of beef, half a cupful of butter, twelve quarts of cold water,
half a small carrot, two large onions, half a head of celery, thirty
pepper-corns, six whole cloves, a small piece each of mace and cinnamon,
four sprigs each of parsley, sweet marjoram, summer savory and thyme,
four leaves of sage, four bay leaves, about one ounce of ham. Put half
of the butter in the soup pot and then put in the meat, which has been
cut into very small pieces. Stir over a hot fire until the meat begins
to brown; then add one quart of the water, and cook until there is a
thick glaze on the bottom of the kettle (this will be about an hour).
Add the remainder of the water and let it come to a boil. Skim
carefully, and set back where it will simmer for six hours. Fry the
vegetables, which have been cut very small, in the remaining butter for
half an hour, being careful not to burn them. When done, turn into the
soup pot, and at the same time add the herbs and spice. Cook one hour
longer; salt to taste and strain. Set in a very cold place until
morning, when skim off all the fat. Turn the soup into the pot, being
careful not to turn in the sediment, and set on the fire. Beat the
whites and shells of two eggs with one cup of cold water. Stir into the
soup, and when it comes to a boil, set back where it will simmer for
twenty minutes. Strain through a napkin, and if not ready to use, put
away in a cold place. This will keep a week in winter, but not more than
three days in summer. It is a particularly nicely-flavored soup, and is
the foundation for any clear soup, the soup taking the name of the solid
used with it, as <i>Consomm&eacute; au Ris</i>, Consomm&eacute; with
Macaroni, etc.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Bouillon.</p>
<p>Bouillon, for Germans and other parties, is made the same as the
clear stock, using a pint of water to the pound of meat, and seasoning
with salt and pepper and with the spice, herbs and vegetables or not, as
you please. It should be remembered that the amount of seasoning in the
recipe referred to is for one gallon of stock.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> White Stock.</p>
<p>Six pounds of a shin of veal, one fowl, three table-spoonfuls of
butter, four stalks of celery, two onions, one blade of mace, one stick
of cinnamon, eight quarts of cold water, salt, pepper. Wash and cut the
veal and fowl into small pieces. Put the butter in the bottom of the
soup pot and then put in the meat. Cover, and cook gently (stirring
often) half an hour, then add the water. Let it come to a boil, then
skim and set back where it will boil gently for six hours. Add the
vegetables and spice and boil one hour longer. Strain and cool quickly.
In the morning take off all the fat. Then turn the jelly gently into a
deep dish, and with a knife scrape off the sediment which is on the
bottom. Put the jelly into a stone pot and set in a cold place. This
will keep a week in cold weather and three days in warm.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Consomm&eacute; &agrave; la Royale.</p>
<p>Two eggs, two table-spoonfuls of milk, one-fourth of a tea-spoonful
of salt. Beat eggs with a spoon, and add milk and salt Turn into a
buttered cup, and place in a pan of warm water. Cook in a slow oven
until firm in the centre. Set away to cool. Cut into small and
prettily-shaped pieces; put into the tureen, and pour one quart of
boiling consomme or clear stock on it.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Cheese Soup.</p>
<p>One and a half cupfuls of flour, one pint of rich cream, four
table-spoonfuls of butter, four of grated Parmesan cheese, a speck of
cayenne, two eggs, three quarts of clear soup stock. Mix flour, cream,
butter, cheese and pepper together. Place the basin in another of hot
water and stir until the mixture becomes a smooth, firm paste. Break
into it the two eggs, and mix quickly and thoroughly. Cook two minutes
longer, and set away to cool. When cold, roll into little balls about
the size of an American walnut When the balls are all formed drop them
into boiling water and cook gently five minutes; then put them in the
soup tureen and pour the boiling stock on them. Pass a plate of finely
grated Parmesan cheese with the soup.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Thick Vegetable Soup.</p>
<p>One quart of the sediment which is left from the clear stock, one
quart of water, one-fourth of a cupful of pearl barley, one good-sized
white turnip, one carrot, half a head of celery, two onions, about two
pounds of cabbage, three potatoes, salt and pepper. Wash the barley and
put it on in the quart of water, and simmer gently for two hours. Then
add all the vegetables (except the potatoes), cut very fine, and the
quart of stock. Boil gently for one hour and a half, then add the
potatoes and the salt and pepper. Cook thirty minutes longer. When there
is no stock, take two pounds of beef and two quarts of water. Cook beef,
barley and water two hours, and add the vegetables as before. The meat
can be served with the soup or as a separate dish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Mulligatawny Soup.</p>
<p>One chicken or fowl weighing three pounds, three pounds of veal, two
large onions, two large slices of carrot, four stalks of celery, three
large table-spoonfuls of butter, one table-spoonful of curry powder,
four of flour, salt, pepper, five quarts of water. Take two
table-spoonfuls of the fat from the opening in the chicken and put in
the soup pot As soon as melted, put in the vegetables, which have been
cut very fine. Let all cook together for twenty minutes, stirring
frequently, that it may not burn; then add the veal, cut into small
pieces. Cook fifteen minutes longer; then add the whole chicken and the
water. Cover, and let it come to a boil. Skim, and set back where it
will simmer for four hours (in the mean time taking out the chicken when
it is tender). Now put the butter into a small frying-pan, and when hot,
add the dry flour. Stir until a rich brown; then take from the fire and
add the curry powder. Stir this mixture into the soup, and let it cook
half an hour longer; then strain through a sieve, rinse out the soup
pot and return the strained soup to it. Add salt and pepper and the
chicken (which has been freed from the bones and skin and cut into
small pieces); simmer very gently thirty minutes. Skim off any fat that
may rise to the top, and serve. This soup is served with plain boiled
rice in a separate dish or with small squares of fried or toasted bread.
The rice can be served in the soup if you choose.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Mulligatawny Soup, No. 2.</p>
<p>Chicken or turkey left from a former dinner, bones and scraps from
roast veal, lamb or mutton, four quarts of water, four stalks of celery,
four table-spoonfuls of butter, four of flour, one of curry, two onions,
two slices of carrot, salt, pepper, half a small cupful of barley. Put
on the bones of the poultry and meat with the water. Have the vegetables
cut very fine, and cook gently twenty minutes in the butter; then skim
them into the soup pot, being careful to press out all the butter. Into
the butter remaining in the pan put the flour, and when that is brown,
add the curry powder, and stir all into the soup. Cook gently four
hours; then season with salt and pepper, and strain. Return to the pot
and add bits of chicken or turkey, as the case may be, and the barley,
which has been simmering two hours and a half in clear water to cover.
Simmer half an hour and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Green Turtle Soup.</p>
<p>One can of green turtle, such as is put up by the "Merriam Packing
Co." Separate the green fat from the other contents of the can, cut into
dice and set aside. Put one quart of water with the remainder of the
turtle; add twelve pepper-corns, six whole cloves, two small sprigs each
of parsley, summer savory, sweet marjoram and thyme, two bay leaves, two
leaves of sage. Have the herbs tied together. Put one large onion, one
slice of carrot, one of turnip, and a stalk of celery, cut fine, into a
pan, with two large table-spoonfuls of butter. Fry fifteen minutes,
being careful not to burn. Skim carefully from the butter and put into
the soup. Now, into the butter in which the vegetables were fried, put
two table-spoonfuls of dry flour, and cook until brown. Stir into the
soup; season with salt and pepper and let simmer very gently one hour.
Strain, skim off all the fat and serve with thin slices of lemon, egg or
force-meat balls, and the green fat. The lemon should have a very thin
rind; should be put into the tureen and the soup poured over it Cooking
the lemon in this or any other soup often gives it a bitter taste. If
the soup is wished quite thick, add a table-spoonful of butter to that
in which the vegetables were cooked, and use three table-spoonfuls of
flour instead of two. Many people use wine in this soup, but it is
delicious without. In case you do use wine there should not be more than
four table-spoonfuls to this quantity. If you desire the soup extremely
rich, use a quart of rich soup stock. The green turtles are so very
large that it is only in great establishments that they are available,
and for this reason a rule for preparing the live turtle is not given.
Few housekeepers would ever see one. The cans contain not what is
commonly called turtle soup, but the meat of the turtle, boiled, and the
proper proportions of lean meat, yellow and green fat put together.
They cost fifty cents each, and a single can will make soup enough for
six persons.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Black Bean Soup.</p>
<p>A pint of black beans, soaked over night in three quarts of water.
In the morning pour off this water, and add three quarts of fresh. Boil
gently six hours. When done, there should be one quart. Add a quart of
stock, six whole cloves, six whole allspice, a small piece of mace, a
small piece of cinnamon, stalk of celery, a bouquet of sweet herbs, also
one good-sized onion and one small slice each of turnip and carrot, all
cut fine and fried in three table-spoonfuls of butter. Into the butter
remaining in the pan put a spoonful of flour, and cook until brown. Add
to soup, and simmer all together one hour. Season with salt and pepper,
and rub through a fine sieve. Serve with slices of lemon and egg balls,
the lemon to be put in the tureen with the soup.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Scotch Broth.</p>
<p>Two pounds of the scraggy part of a neck of mutton. Cut the meat
from the bones, and cut off all the fat. Then cut meat into small pieces
and put into soup pot with one large slice of turnip, two of carrot, one
onion and a stalk of celery, all cut fine, half a cup of barley and
three pints of cold water. Simmer gently two hours. On to the bones put
one pint of water; simmer two hours, and strain upon the soup. Cook a
table-spoonful of flour and one of butter together until perfectly
smooth; stir into soup, and add a teaspoonful of chopped parsley. Season
with salt and pepper.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Meg Merrilies' Soup.</p>
<p>One hare, one grouse, four onions, one small carrot, four slices of
turnip, a bouquet of sweet herbs, three table-spoonfuls of rice flour,
four table-spoonfuls of butter, half a cupful of stale bread, half a
cupful of milk, one egg, six quarts of water. Wash the grouse and hare
and put to boil in the six quarts of cold water. When this comes to a
boil, skim, and set back where it will simmer for one hour. Then take
out the hare and grouse and cut all the meat from the bones. Return the
bones to the soup and simmer two hours longer. Cut the meat into
handsome pieces, roll in flour, and fry in the butter till a rich brown.
Set aside for the present. Slice the onions, and fry in the butter in
which the meat was fried; when brown, add to the soup. Make force-meat
balls of the livers of the hare and grouse (which have been boiled one
hour in the stock), the egg, bread and milk. Boil the bread and milk
together until a smooth paste. Mash the livers with a strong spoon, then
add bread and milk and the egg, unbeaten. Season well with pepper and
salt and, if you like, with a little lemon juice. Shape into small balls
and fry in either chicken fat or butter. Put these into the soup twenty
minutes before dishing. Have the turnip and carrot cut into small pieces
and cooked one hour in clear water. When the bones and the onions have
simmered two hours, strain and return to the soup pot. Add the fried
meat and vegetables. Mix the rice flour with a cupful of cold water; add
to the soup, season with salt and pepper, simmer ten minutes. Add
force-meat balls and simmer twenty minutes longer.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Okra Soup.</p>
<p>One cold roast chicken, two quarts of stock (any kind), one of
water, quarter of a pound of salt pork, one quart of green okra, an
onion, salt, pepper, three table-spoonfuls of flour. Cut the okra pods
into small pieces. Slice the pork and onion. Fry the pork, and then add
the onion and okra. Cover closely, and fry half an hour. Cut all the
meat from the chicken. Put the bones on with the water. Add the okra and
onion, first being careful to press out all the pork fat possible. Into
the fat remaining put the flour, and stir until it becomes a rich brown;
add this to the other ingredients. Cover the pot, and simmer three
hours; then rub through a sieve, and add the stock, salt and pepper and
the meat of the chicken, cut into small pieces. Simmer gently twenty
minutes. Serve with a dish of boiled rice. </p>

from the cob, half a pint of shell beans, two onions, four stalks of
celery, two ripe tomatoes, one slice of carrot, one of turnip, two
pounds of veal, quarter of a pound of fat ham or bacon, two
table-spoonfuls of flour, four quarts of water, salt, pepper. Fry the
ham or bacon, being careful not to bum. Cut the veal into dice; roll
these in the flour and fry brown in the ham fat; then put them in the
soup pot. Fry the onion, carrot and turnip in the remaining fat. Add
these to the veal, and then add the okra, cut into small pieces, the
shell beans, celery and water. Simmer two hours, and then add the
tomatoes, corn, peas and salt and pepper. Simmer half an hour longer and
serve without straining. If dried okra be used for either soup, half the
quantity given in the recipes is sufficient Okra is often called gumbo.
The same kind of a soup is meant under both names.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Grouse Soup.</p>
<p>The bones of two roasted grouse and the breast of one, a quart of
any kind of stock, or pieces and bones of cold roasts; three quarts of
cold water, two slices of turnip, two of carrot, two large onions, two
cloves, two stalks of celery, a bouquet of sweet herbs, three
table-spoonfuls of butter, three of flour. Cook the grouse bones in
three quarts of water four hours. The last hour add the vegetables and
the cloves; then strain, and return to the lire with the quart of stock.
Cook the butter and the flour together until a rich brown, and then turn
into the stock. Cut the breast of the grouse into very small pieces and
add to the soup. Season with salt and pepper and simmer gently half an
hour. If there is any fat on the soup, skim it off. Serve with fried
bread. When bones and meat are used instead of the stock, use one more
quart of water, and cook them with the grouse bones.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Spring Soup.</p>
<p>Half a pint of green peas, half a pint of cauliflower, one pint of
turnip, carrot, celery and string beans (all the four vegetables being
included in the pint), half a cupful of tomato, half a pint of asparagus
heads, two quarts of soup stock--any kind will do; three table-spoonfuls
of butter, three table-spoonfuls of flour, and salt and pepper. Cook all
the vegetables, except the peas and tomato, in water to cover one hour.
Cook butter and dry flour together until smooth, but not brown; stir
into the stock, which has been heated to the boiling point. Now add the
tomato and simmer gently fifteen minutes; then strain. Add the peas and
cooked vegetables to the strained soup, and simmer again for thirty
minutes. Serve small slices of toasted bread in a separate dish.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Spring and Summer Soup Without Stock</span>.</p>
<p>Quarter of a pound of salt pork, or three large table-spoonfuls of
butter; three large young onions, half a small head of cabbage, three
potatoes, half a small carrot, half a small white turnip, three
table-spoonfuls of flour, two quarts of water, six large slices of
toasted bread, salt, pepper, one small parsnip. Cut the pork into thin
slices; place these in the soup pot and let them fry out slowly. Have
the vegetables (except the potatoes), cut quite fine, and when the pork
is cooked, put the vegetables into the pot with it. Cover tightly, and
let cook very gently, on the back of the stove, one hour. Stir
frequently to prevent burning. Add the water, which should be boiling.
Let simmer gently for one hour, and then add the potatoes, cut into
slices, and the flour, which has been mixed with a little cold water.
Season with salt and pepper, and simmer gently an hour longer. Have the
toasted bread in the tureen. Turn the soup on it and serve. A pint of
green peas, cooked in the soup the last half, is a great addition. When
the butter is used, let it melt in the soup pot before adding the
vegetables.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Giblet Soup.</p>
<p>The giblets from two or three fowl or chickens, any kind of stock,
or if there are remains of the roast chickens, use these; one large
onion, two slices of carrot, one of turnip, two stalks of celery, two
quarts of water, one of stock, two large table-spoonfuls of butter, two
of flour, salt, pepper. Put the giblets on to boil in the two quarts of
water, and boil gently until reduced to one quart (it will take about
two hours); then take out the giblets. Cut all the hard, tough parts
from the gizzards, and put hearts, livers and gizzards together and chop
rather coarse. Return them to the liquor in which they were boiled, and
add the quart of stock. Have the vegetables cut fine, and fry them in
the butter until they are very tender (about fifteen minutes), but be
careful they do not burn; then add the dry flour to them and stir until
the flour browns. Turn this mixture into the soup, and season with
pepper and salt. Cook gently half an hour and serve with toasted bread.
If the chicken bones are used, put them on to boil in three quarts of
water, and boil the giblets with them. When you take out the giblets,
strain the stock through a sieve and return to the pot; then proceed as
before.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Potage &agrave; la Reine,</p>
<p>Boil a large fowl in three quarts of water until tender (the water
should never more than bubble). Skim off the fat, and add a teacupful of
rice, and, also, a slice of carrot, one of turnip, a small piece of
celery and an onion, which have been cooked slowly for fifteen minutes
in two large table-spoonfuls of butter. Skim this butter carefully from
the vegetables, and into the pan in which it is, stir a table-spoonful
of flour. Cook until smooth, but not brown. Add this, as well as a small
piece of cinnamon and of mace, and four whole cloves. Cook all together
slowly for two hours. Chop and pound the breast of the fowl very fine.
Rub the soup through a fine sieve; add the pounded breast and again rub
the whole through the sieve. Put back on the fire and add one and a half
table-spoonfuls of salt, a fourth of a teaspoonful of pepper and a pint
of cream, which has come just to a boil. Boil up once and serve. This is
a delicious soup.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Tomato Soup.</p>
<p>One quart can of tomato, two heaping table-spoonfuls of flour, one
of butter, one teaspoonful of salt, one of sugar, a pint of hot water.
Let tomato and water come to a boil Rub flour, butter and a
table-spoonful of tomato together. Stir into boiling mixture, add
seasoning, boil all together fifteen minutes, rub through a sieve, and
serve with toasted bread. This bread should first be cut in thin slices;
should be buttered, cut into little squares, placed in a pan, buttered
side up, and browned in a quick oven.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Mock Bisque Soup.</p>
<p>A quart can of tomato, three pints of milk, a large table-spoonful
of flour, butter the size of an egg, pepper and salt to taste, a scant
teaspoonful of soda. Put the tomato on to stew, and the milk in a double
kettle to boil, reserving however, half a cupful to mix with flour. Mix
the flour smoothly with this cold milk, stir into the boiling milk, and
cook ten minutes. To the tomato add the soda; stir well, and rub through
a strainer that is fine enough to keep back the seeds. Add butter, salt
and pepper to the milk, and then the tomato. Serve immediately. If half
the rule is made, stir the tomato well in the can before dividing, as
the liquid portion is the more acid.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Onion Soup.</p>
<p>One quart of milk, six large onions, yolks of four eggs, three
table-spoonfuls of butter, a large one of flour, one cupful of cream,
salt, pepper. Put the butter in a frying-pan. Cut the onions into thin
slices and drop in the butter. Stir until they begin to cook; then cover
tight and set back where they will simmer, but not burn, for half an
hour. Now put the milk on to boil, and then add the dry flour to the
onions, and stir constantly for three minutes over the fire. Then turn
the mixture into the milk and cook fifteen minutes. Rub the soup through
a strainer, return to the fire, season with salt and pepper. Beat the
yokes of the eggs well; add the cream to them and stir into the soup.
Cook three minutes, stirring constantly. If you have no cream, use milk,
in which case add a table-spoonful of butter at the same time.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Potato Soup.</p>
<p>A quart of milk, six large potatoes, one stalk of celery, an onion
and a table-spoonful of butter. Put milk to boil with onion and celery.
Pare potatoes and boil thirty minutes. Turn off the water, and mash fine
and light. Add boiling milk and the butter, and pepper and salt to
taste. Rub through a strainer and serve immediately. A cupful of whipped
cream, added when in the tureen, is a great improvement. This soup must
not be allowed to stand, not even if kept hot. Served as soon as ready,
it is excellent.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Asparagus Soup.</p>
<p>Two bundles of asparagus, one quart of white stock or water, one
pint of milk, and one of cream, if stock is used, but if water, use all
cream; three table-spoonfuls of butter, three of flour, one onion, salt
and pepper. Cut the tops from one bunch of the asparagus and cook them
twenty minutes in salted water to cover. The remainder of the asparagus
cook twenty minutes in the quart of stock or water. Cut the onion into
thin slices and fry in the butter ten minutes, being careful not to
burn; then add the asparagus that has been boiled in the stock. Cook
five minutes, stirring constantly; then add flour, and cook five minutes
longer. Turn this mixture into the boiling stock and boil gently twenty
minutes. Rub through a sieve, add the milk and cream, which has just
come to a boil, and also the asparagus heads. Season with salt and
pepper, and serve. Dropped eggs can be served with it if you choose, but
they are rattier heavy for such a delicate soup.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Green Pea Soup.</p>
<p>Cover a quart of green peas with hot water, and boil, with an onion,
until they will mash easily. (The time will depend on the age of the
peas, but will be from twenty to thirty minutes.) Mash, and add a pint
of stock or water. Cook together two table-spoonfuls of butter and one
of flour until smooth, but not brown. Add to the peas, and then add a
cupful of cream and one of milk. Season with salt and pepper, and let
boil up once. Strain and serve. A cupful of whipped cream added the last
moment is an improvement.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Pumpkin Soup.</p>
<p>Two pounds of pumpkin. Take out seeds and pare off the rind. Cut
into small pieces, and put into a stew-pan with half a pint of water.
Simmer slowly an hour and a half, then rub through a sieve and put back
on the fire with one and a half pints of boiling milk, butter the size
of an egg, one tea-spoonful of sugar, salt and pepper to taste, and
three slices of stale bread, cut into small squares. Stir occasionally;
and when it boils, serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Cream of Celery Soup.</p>
<p>A pint of milk, a table-spoonful of flour, one of butter, a head of
celery, a large slice of onion and small piece of mace. Boil celery in a
pint of water from thirty to forty-five minutes; boil mace, onion and
milk together. Mix flour with two table-spoonfuls of cold milk, and add
to boiling milk. Cook ten minutes. Mash celery in the water in which it
has been cooked, and stir into boiling milk. Add butter, and season with
salt and pepper to taste. Strain and serve immediately. The flavor is
improved by adding a cupful of whipped cream when the soup is in the
tureen.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Tapioca Cream Soup.</p>
<p>One quart of white stock, one pint of cream or milk, one onion, two
stalks of celery, one-third of a cupful of tapioca, two cupfuls of cold
water, one table-spoonful of butter, a small piece of mace, salt,
pepper. Wash the tapioca, and soak over night in cold water. Cook it and
the stock together, very gently, for one hour. Cut the onion and celery
into small pieces, and put on to cook for twenty minutes with the milk
and mace. Strain on the tapioca and stock. Season with salt and pepper,
add butter, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Cream of Rice Soup.</p>
<p>Two quarts of chicken stock (the water in which fowl have been
boiled will answer), one tea-cupful of rice, a quart of cream or milk, a
small onion, a stalk of celery and salt and pepper to taste. Wash rice
carefully, and add to chicken stock, onion and celery. Cook slowly two
hours (it should hardly bubble). Put through a sieve; add seasoning and
the milk or cream, which has been allowed to come just to a boil. If
milk, use also a table-spoonful of butter.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Cream of Barley Soup.</p>
<p>A tea-cupful of barley, well washed; three pints of chicken stock,
an onion and a small piece each of mace and cinnamon. Cook slowly
together five hours; then rub through a sieve, and add one and a half
pints of boiling cream or milk. If milk, add also two table-spoonfuls of
butter. Salt and pepper to taste. The yolks of four eggs, beaten with
four table-spoonfuls of milk, and cooked a minute in the boiling milk or
cream, makes the soup very much richer.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Duchess Soup.</p>
<p>One quart of milk, two large onions, three eggs, two table-spoonfuls
of butter, two of flour, salt, pepper, two table-spoonfuls of grated
cheese. Put milk on to boil. Fry the butter and onions together for
eight minutes; then add dry flour, and cook two minutes longer, being
careful not to burn. Stir into the milk, and cook ten minutes. Rub
through a strainer, and return to the fire. Now add the cheese. Beat the
eggs, with a speck of pepper and half a teaspoonful of salt. Season the
soup with salt and pepper. Hold the colander over the soup and pour the
eggs through, upon the butter, and set back for three minutes where it
will not boll. Then serve. The cheese may be omitted if it is not liked.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Yacht Oyster Soup.</p>
<p>A quart of milk, one of oysters, a head of celery, a small onion,
half a cupful of butter, half a cupful of powdered cracker, one
teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce, a speck of cayenne and salt and
pepper to taste. Chop onion and celery fine. Put on to boil with milk
for twenty minutes. Then strain, and add the butter, cracker, oyster
liquor, (which has been boiled and skimmed), and finally the seasoning
and oysters. Cook three minutes longer, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Lobster Soup with Milk.</p>
<p>Meat of a small lobster, chopped fine; three crackers, rolled fine,
butter--size of an egg, salt and pepper to taste and a speck of cayenne.
Mix all in the same pan, and add, gradually, a pint of boiling milk,
stirring all the while. Boil up once, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Lobster Soup with Stock.</p>
<p>One small lobster, three pints of water or stock, three large
table-spoonfuls of butter and three of flour, a speck of cayenne, white
pepper and salt to taste. Break up the body of the lobster, and cut off
the scraggy parts of the meat. Pour over these and the body the water or
stock. If there is "coral" in the lobster, pound it and use also. Boil
twenty minutes. Cook the butter and flour until smooth, but not brown.
Stir into the cooking mixture and add the seasoning. Boil two minutes,
and strain into a saucepan. Have the remainder of the lobster meat--that
found in the tail and claws--cut up very fine, and add it to the soup.
Boil up once, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Philadelphia Clam Soup.</p>
<p>Twenty-five small clams, one quart of milk, half a cupful of butter,
one table-spoonful of chopped parsley, three potatoes, two large
table-spoonfuls of flour, salt, pepper. The clams should be chopped fine
end put into a colander to drain. Pare the potatoes, and chop rather
fine. Put them on to boil with the milk, in a double kettle. Rub the
butter and flour together until perfectly creamy, and when the milk and
potatoes have been boiling fifteen minutes, stir this in, and cook eight
minutes more. Add the parsley, pepper and salt, and cook three minutes
longer. Now add the clams. Cook one minute longer, and serve. This gives
a very delicate soup, as the liquor from the clams is not used.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Fish Chowder.</p>
<p>Five pounds of any kind of fish, (the light salt-water fish is the
best), half a pound of pork, two large onions, one quart of sliced
potatoes, one quart of water, one pint of milk, two table-spoonfuls of
flour, six crackers, salt, pepper. Skin the fish, and cut all the flesh
from the bones. Put the bones onto cook in the quart of water, and
simmer gently ten minutes. Fry the pork; then add the onions, cut into
slices. Cover, and cook five minutes; then add the flour, and cook eight
minutes longer, stirring often. Strain on this the water in which the
fish bones were cooked and boil gently for five minutes; then strain all
on the potatoes and fish. Season with salt and pepper, and simmer
fifteen minutes. Add the milk and the crackers, which were first soaked
for three minutes, in the milk. Let it boil up once, and serve. The milk
maybe omitted, and a pint of tomatoes used, if you like.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Corn Chowder.</p>
<p>Cut enough green corn from the cob to make a quart; pare and slice
one quart of potatoes; pare and slice two onions. Cut half a pound of
pork in slices, and fry until brown then take up, and fry the onions in
the fat. Put the potatoes and corn into the kettle in layers, sprinkling
each layer with salt, pepper and flour. Use half a teaspoonful of
pepper, one and a half table-spoonfuls of salt and three of flour. Place
the gravy strainer on the vegetables, and turn the onions and pork fat
into it, and with a spoon press the juice through; then slowly pour one
and one-fourth quarts of boiling water through the strainer, rubbing as
much onion through as possible. Take out the strainer, cover the kettle,
and boil gently for twenty minutes. Mix three table-spoonfuls of flour
with a little milk, and when perfectly smooth, add a pint and a half of
rich milk. Stir this into the boiling chowder. Taste to see if seasoned
enough, and if it is not, add more pepper and salt. Then add six
crackers, split, and dipped for a minute in cold water. Put on the
cover, boil up once, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Corn Soup.</p>
<p>One pint of grated green com, one quart of milk, one pint of hot
water, one heaping table-spoonful of flour, two table-spoonfuls of
butter, one slice of onion, salt and pepper to taste. Cook the corn in
the water thirty minutes. Let the milk and onion come to a boil. Have
the flour and butter mixed together, and add a few table-spoonfuls of
the boiling milk. When perfectly smooth stir into the milk; and cook
eight minutes. Take out the onion and add the corn. Season to taste, and
serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Glaze.</p>
<p>Boil four quarts of consomm&eacute; rapidly until reduced to one
quart. Turn into small jars, and cool quickly. This will keep for a
month in a cool, dry place. It is used for soups and sauces and for
glazing meats.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> French Paste for Soups.</p>
<p>A preparation for flavoring and coloring soups and sauces comes in
small tin boxes. In each box there are twelve little squares, which look
very much like chocolate caramels. One of these will give two quarts of
soup the most delicious flavor and a rich color. The paste should not be
cooked with the soup, but put into the tureen, and the soup poured over
it; and as the soup is served, stir with the ladle. If you let it boil
with the clear soup the flavor will not be as fine and the soup not as
clear. It may be used with any dark or clear soup, even when already
seasoned. It is for sale in Boston by S.S. Pierce and McDewell &amp;
Adams; New York: Park, Tilford &amp; Co., retail, E.C. Hayward &amp;
Co., 192-4 Chamber street, wholesale; Philadelphia: Githens &amp;
Rexsame's; Chicago: Rockwood Bros., 102 North Clark street; St. Louis:
David Nicholson. The paste costs only twenty-five cents per box.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Egg Balls.</p>
<p>Boil four eggs ten minutes. Drop into cold water, and when cool
remove the yolks. Pound these in a mortar until reduced to a paste, and
then beat them with a teaspoonful of salt, a speck of pepper and the
white of one raw egg. Form in balls about the size of a walnut. Roll in
flour, and fry brown in butter or chicken fat, being careful not to burn.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Fried Bread for Soups.</p>
<p>Cut stale bread into dice, and fry in boiling fat until brown. It
will take about half a minute. The fat must be smoking in the centre
when the bread is put into it.<br>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">A General Chapter on Fish.</p>
<p>It may seem as if a small number of recipes has been given, but the
aim has been to present under the heads of Baking, Boiling, Broiling,
Frying and Stewing such general directions that one cannot be at a loss
as to how to prepare any kind of fish. Once having mastered the five
primary methods, and learned also how to make sauces, the variety of
dishes within the cook's power is great All that is required is
confidence in the rules, which are perfectly reliable, and will always
bring about a satisfactory result if followed carefully. Fish, to be
eatable, should be perfectly fresh. Nothing else in the line of food
deteriorates so rapidly, especially the white fish-those that are nearly
free of oil, like cod, cusk, etc. Most of the oil in this class centres
in the liver. Salmon, mackerel, etc., have it distributed throughout the
body, which gives a higher and richer flavor, and at the same time tends
to preserve the fish. People who do not live near the seashore do not
get that delicious flavor which fish just caught have. If the fish is
kept on ice until used, it will retain much of its freshness; let it
once get heated and nothing will bring back the delicate flavor. Fresh
fish will be firm, and the skin and scales bright. When fish looks dim
and limp, do not buy it. Fish should be washed quickly in only one <i>(cold)</i>
water, and should not be allowed to stand in it. If it is cut up before
cooking, wash while whole, else much of the flavor will be lost. For
frying, the fat should be deep enough to cover the article, and yet have
it float from the bottom. Unless one cooks great quantities of fish in
this way it is not necessary to have a separate pot of fat for this kind
of frying. The same pot, with proper care, will answer for chops,
cutlets, muffins, potatoes, croquettes, etc. All the cold fish left from
any mode of cooking can be utilized in making delicious salads,
croquettes, and escallops.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Boiled Fish.</p>
<p>A general role for boiling fish, which will hold good for all kinds,
and thus save a great deal of time and space, is this: Any fresh fish
weighing between four and six pounds should be first washed in cold
water and then put into boiling water enough to cover it, and containing
one table-spoonful of salt. Simmer gently thirty minutes; then take up.
A fish kettle is a great convenience, and it can be used also for
boiling hams. When you do not have a fish kettle, keep a piece of strong
white cotton cloth in which pin the fish before putting into the boiling
water. This will hold it in shape. Hard boiling will break the fish,
and, of course, there will be great waste, besides the dish's not
looking so handsome and appetizing. There should be a gentle bubbling of
the water, and nothing more, all the time the fish is in it, A fish
weighing more than six pounds should cook five minutes longer for every
additional <i>two</i> pounds. Boiled fish can be served with a great
variety of sauces. After you have learned to make them (which is a
simple matter), if you cannot get a variety of fish you will not miss it
particularly, the sauce and mode of serving doing much to change the
whole character of the dish. Many people put a table-spoonful of vinegar
in the water in which the fish is boiled. The fish flakes a little more
readily for it. Small fish, like trout, require from four to eight
minutes to cook. They are, however, much better baked, broiled or fried.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Court-Bouillon.</p>
<p>This preparation gives boiled fish a better flavor than cooking in
clear water does. Many cooks use wine in it, but there is no necessity
for it. Four quarts of water, one onion, one slice of carrot, two
cloves, two table-spoonfuls of salt, one teaspoonful of pepper, one
table-spoonful of vinegar, the juice of half a lemon and a bouquet of
sweet herbs are used. Tie the onion, carrot, cloves and herbs in a piece
of muslin, and put in the water with the other ingredients. Cover, and
boil slowly for one hour. Then put in the fish and cook as directed for
plain boiling.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Boiled Cod with Lobster Sauce.</p>
<p>Boil the fish, as directed [see boiled fish], and, when done,
carefully remove the skin from one side; then turn the fish over on to
the dish on which it is to be served, skin side up. Remove the skin from
this side. Wipe the dish with a damp cloth. Pour a few spoonfuls of the
sauce over the fish, and the remainder around it; garnish with parsley,
and serve. This is a handsome dish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Boiled Haddock with Lobster Sauce.</p>
<p>The same as cod. In fact, all kinds of fish can be served in the
same manner; but the lighter are the better, as the sauce is so rich
that it is not really the thing for salmon and blue fish. Many of the
best cooks and caterers, however, use the lobster sauce with salmon, but
salmon has too rich and delicate a flavor to be mixed with the lobster.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Cold Boiled Fish, a la Vinaigrette.</p>
<p>If the fish is whole, take off the head and skin, and then place it
in the centre of a dish. Have two cold hard-boiled eggs, and cut fine
with a silver knife or spoon, (steel turns the egg black). Sprinkle the
fish with this, and garnish either with small lettuce leaves,
water-cresses, or cold boiled potatoes and beets, cut in slices. Place
tastefully around the dish, with here and there a sprig of parsley.
Serve the vinaigrette sauce in a separate dish. Help to the garnish when
the fish is served, and pour a spoonful of the sauce over the fish as
you serve it. This makes a nice dish for tea in summer, and takes the
place of a salad, as it is, in fact, a kind of salad.</p>
<p>If the fish is left from the dinner, and is broken, pick free from
skin and bones, heap it lightly in the centre of the dish, sprinkle the
sauce over it, and set away in a cool place until tea time. Then add the
garnish, and serve as before. Many people prefer the latter method, as
the fish is seasoned better and more easily served. The cold fish
remaining from a bake or broil can be served in the same manner. This
same dish can be served with a sauce piquante or Tartare sauce, for a
change.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Baked Fish.</p>
<p>As for the boiled fish, a general rule, that will cover all kinds of
baked fish, is herewith given: A fish weighing about five pounds; three
large, or five small, crackers, quarter of a pound of salt pork, two
table-spoonfuls of salt, quarter of a teaspoonful of pepper, half a
table-spoonful of chopped parsley, two table-spoonfuls of flour.</p>
<p>If the fish has not already been scraped free of scales, scrape, and
wash clean; then rub into it one table-spoonful of the salt. Roll the
crackers very fine, and add to them the parsley, one table-spoonful of
chopped pork, half the pepper, half a table-spoonful of salt, and cold
water to moisten well. Put this into the body of the fish, and fasten
together with a skewer. Butter a tin sheet and put it into a baking pan.
Cut gashes across the fish, about half an inch deep and two inches long.
Cut the remainder of the pork into strips, and put these into the
gashes. Now put the fish into the baking pan, and dredge well with salt,
pepper and flour. Cover the bottom of the pan with hot water, and put
into a rather hot oven. Bake one hour, basting often with the gravy in
the pan, and dredging each time with salt, pepper and flour. The water
in the pan must often be renewed, as the bottom is simply to be covered
with it each time. The fish should be basted every fifteen minutes. When
it is cooked, lift from the pan on to the tin sheet, and slide it
carefully into the centre of the dish on which it is to be served. Pour
around it Hollandaise sauce, tomato sauce, or any kind you like. Garnish
with parsley.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Broiled Fish.</p>
<p>Bluefish, young cod, mackerel, salmon, large trout, and all other
fish, when they weigh between half a pound and four pounds, are nice for
broiling. When smaller or larger they are not so good. Always use a
double broiler, which, before putting the fish into it, rub with either
butter or a piece of salt pork. This prevents sticking. The thickness of
the fish will have to be the guide in broiling. A bluefish weighing four
pounds will take from twenty minutes to half an hour to cook. Many cooks
brown the fish handsomely over the coals and then put it into the oven
to finish broiling. Where the fish is very thick, this is a good plan.
If the fish is taken from the broiler to be put into the oven, it should
be slipped on to a tin sheet, that it may slide easily into the platter
at serving time; for nothing so mars a dish of fish as to have it come
to the table broken. In broiling, the inside should be exposed to the
fire first, and then the skin. Great care must be taken that the skin
does not burn. Mackerel will broil in from twelve to twenty minutes,
young cod (also called scrod) in from twenty to thirty minutes, bluefish
in from twenty to thirty minutes, salmon, in from twelve to twenty
minutes, and whitefish, bass, mullet, etc., in about eighteen minutes.
All kinds of broiled fish can be served with a seasoning of salt, pepper
and butter, or with any of the following sauces: <i>bearer noir,
ma&icirc;tre d' h&ocirc;tel</i>, Tartare, sharp, tomato and curry.
Always, when possible, garnish with parsley or something else green.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Broiled Halibut.</p>
<p>Season the slices with salt and pepper, and lay them in melted
butter for half an hour, having them well covered on both sides. Roll in
flour, and broil for twelve minutes over a clear fire. Serve on a hot
dish, garnishing with parsley and slices of lemon. The slices of halibut
should be about an inch thick, and for every pound there should be three
table-spoonfuls of butter.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Broiled Halibut, with Ma&icirc;tre d'
H&ocirc;tel Butter.</p>
<p>Butter both sides of the broiler. Season the slices of halibut with
salt and pepper, place them in the broiler and cook over clear coals for
twelve minutes, turning frequently. Place on a hot dish, and spread on
them the sauce, using one spoonful to each pound. Garnish with parsley.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Stewed Fish.</p>
<p>Six pounds of any kind of fish, large or small; three large pints of
water, quarter of a pound of pork, or, half a cupful of butter; two
large onions, three table-spoonfuls of flour, salt and pepper to taste.
Cut the heads from the fish, and cut out all the bones. Put the heads
and bones on to boil in the three pints of water. Cook gently half an
hour. In the meanwhile cut the pork in slices, and fry brown. Cut the
onions in slices, and fry in the pork fat. Stir the dry flour into the
onion and fat, and cook three minutes, stirring all the time. Now pour
over this the water in which the bones have been cooking, and simmer ten
minutes. Have the fish cut in pieces about three inches square. Season
well with salt and pepper, and place in the stew-pan. Season the sauce
with salt and pepper, and strain on the fish. Cover tight, and simmer
twenty minutes. A bouquet of sweet herbs, simmered with the bones, is an
improvement. Taste to see if the sauce is seasoned enough, and dish on a
large platter. Garnish with potato balls and parsley. The potato balls
are cut from the raw potatoes with a vegetable scoop, and boiled ten
minutes in salted water. Put them in little heaps around the dish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Fried Fish.</p>
<p>All small fish, like brook trout, smelts, perch, etc., are best
fried. They are often called pan-fish for this reason. They should be
cleaned, washed and drained, then well salted, and rolled in flour and
Indian meal (half of each), which has been thoroughly mixed and salted.
For every four pounds of fish have half a pound of salt pork, cut in
thin slices, and fried a crisp brown. Take the pork from the pan and put
the fish in, having only enough to cover the bottom. Fry brown on one
side; turn, and fry the other side. Serve on a hot dish, with the salt
pork as a garnish. Great care must be taken that the pork or fat does
not burn, and yet to have it hot enough to brown quickly. Cod, haddock,
cusk and halibut are all cut in handsome slices and fried in this
manner; or, the slices can be well seasoned with salt and pepper, dipped
in beaten egg, rolled in bread or cracker crumbs and fried in boiling
fat enough to cover. This method gives the handsomer dish, but the first
the more savory. Where Indian meal is not liked, all flour can be used.
Serve very hot Any kind of fried fish can be served with <i>beurre noir</i>,
but this is particularly nice for that which is fried without pork.
When the cooked fish is placed in the dish, pour the butter over it,
garnish with parsley, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> To Cook Salt Codfish.</p>
<p>The fish should be thoroughly washed, and soaked in cold water over
night. In the morning change the water, and put on to cook. As soon as
the water comes to the boiling point set back where it will keep <i>hot</i>,
but will <i>not boil</i>. From four to six hours will cook a very dry,
hard fish, and there are kinds which will cook in half an hour. The
boneless codfish, put up at the Isles of Shoals, by Brown &amp; Seavey,
will cook in from half an hour to an hour. Where a family uses only a
small quantity of salt fish at a time, this is a convenient and
economical way to buy it, as there is no waste with bone or skin. It
comes in five pound boxes, and costs sixty cents.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Dropped Fish Balls.</p>
<p>One pint bowlful of raw fish, two heaping bowlfuls of pared
potatoes, (let the potatoes be under medium size), two eggs, butter, the
size of an egg, and a little pepper. Pick the fish very fine, and
measure it lightly in the bowl. Put the potatoes into the boiler, and
the fish on top of them; then cover with boiling water, and boil half an
hour. Drain off all the water, and mash fish and potatoes together until
fine and light. Then add the butter and pepper, and the egg, well
beaten. Have a deep kettle of <i>boiling</i> fat. Dip a table-spoon in
it, and then take up a spoonful of the mixture, having care to get it
into as good shape as possible. Drop into the boiling fat, and cook
until brown, which should be in two minutes. Be careful not to crowd the
balls, and, also, that the fat is hot enough. The spoon should be dipped
in the fat every time you take a spoonful of the mixture. These balls
are delicious.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Common Fish Balls.</p>
<p>One pint of finely-chopped cooked salt fish, six medium-sized
potatoes, one egg, one heaping table-spoonful of butter, pepper, two
table-spoonfuls of cream, or four of milk. Pare the potatoes, and put on
in <i>boiling</i> water. Boil half an hour. Drain off all the water,
turn the potatoes into the tray with the fish, and mash light and fine
with a vegetable masher. Add the butter, pepper, milk and eggs, and mix
all very thoroughly. Taste to see if salt enough. Shape into smooth
balls, the size of an egg, and fry brown in boiling fat enough to float
them. They will cook in three minutes. If the potatoes are very mealy it
will take more milk or cream to moisten them, about two spoonfuls more.
If the fat is smoking in the centre, and the balls are made <i>very</i>
smooth, they will not soak fat; but if the fat is not hot enough, they
certainly will. Putting too many balls into the fat at one time cools
it. Put in say four or five. Let the fat regain its first temperature,
then add more.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Salt Fish with Dropped Eggs.</p>
<p>One pint of cooked salt fish, one pint of milk or cream, two
table-spoonfuls of flour, one of butter, six eggs, pepper. Put milk on
to boil, keeping half a cupful of it to mix the flour. When it boils,
stir in the flour, which has been mixed smooth with the milk; then add
the fish, which has been flaked. Season, and cook ten minutes. Have six
slices of toasted bread on a platter. Drop six eggs into boiling water,
being careful to keep the shape. Turn the fish and cream on to the
toast. Lift the eggs carefully from the water, as soon as the whites are
set, and place very gently on the fish. Garnish the dish with points of
toast and parsley.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Salt Codfish, in Pur&eacute;e of Potatoes.</p>
<p>Six large potatoes, one pint and one cupful of milk, two
table-spoonfuls of butter, a small slice of onion (about the size of a
silver quarter), one pint of cooked salt codfish, salt, pepper, one
large table-spoonful of flour. Pare the potatoes and boil half an hour;
then drain off the water, and mash them light and fine. Add the salt,
pepper, one table-spoonful of butter, and the cupful of milk, which has
been allowed to come to a boil. Beat very thoroughly, and spread a thin
layer of the potatoes on the centre of a hot platter. Heap the remainder
around the edge, making a wall to keep in the cream and fish, which
should then be poured in. Garnish the border with parsley, and serve.</p>
<p>To prepare the fish: Put the pint of milk on to boil with the onion.
Mix flour and butter together, and when well mixed, add two
table-spoonfuls of the hot milk. Stir all into the boiling milk, skim
out the onion, add the fish, and cook ten minutes. Season with pepper,
and if not salty enough, with salt. This is a nice dish for breakfast,
lunch or dinner.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Salt Fish Souffl&eacute;.</p>
<p>One pint of finely-chopped cooked salt fish, eight good-sized
potatoes, three-fourths of a cupful of milk or cream, four eggs, salt,
pepper, two generous table-spoonfuls of butter. Pare the potatoes and
boil thirty minutes. Drain the water from them, and mash very fine; then
mix thoroughly with the fish. Add butter, seasoning and the hot milk.
Have two of the eggs well beaten, which stir into the mixture, and heap
this in the dish in which it is to be served. Place in the oven for ten
minutes. Beat the whites of the two remaining eggs to a stiff froth, and
add a quarter of a teaspoonful of salt; then add yolks. Spread this over
the dish of fish; return to the oven to brown, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Cusk, &agrave; la Cr&egrave;me.</p>
<p>A cusk, cod or haddock, weighing five or six pounds; one quart of
milk, two table-spoonfuls of flour, one of butter, one small slice of
onion, two sprigs of parsley, salt, pepper. Put the fish on in boiling
water enough to cover, and which contains one table-spoonful of salt.
Cook gently twenty minutes; then lift out of the water, but let it
remain on the tray. Now carefully remove all the skin and the head; then
turn the fish over into the dish in which it is to be served (it should
be stone china), and scrape off the skin from the other side. Pick out
all the small bones. You will find them the whole length of the back,
and a few in the lower part of the fish, near the tail. They are in rows
like pins in a paper, and if you start all right it will take but a few
minutes to remove them. Then take out the back-bone, starting at the
head and working gently down toward the tail. Great care must be taken,
that the fish may keep its shape. Cover with the cream, and bake about
ten minutes, just to brown it a little. Garnish with parsley or little
puff-paste cakes; or, you can cover it with the whites of three eggs,
beaten to a stiff froth, and then slightly brown.</p>
<p>To prepare the cream: Put the milk, parsley and onion on to boil,
reserving half a cupful of milk to mix with the flour. When it boils,
stir in the flour, which has been mixed smoothly with the cold milk.
Cook eight minutes. Season highly with salt and pepper, add the butter,
strain on the fish, and proceed as directed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Escaloped Fish.</p>
<p>One pint of milk, one pint of cream, four table-spoonfuls of flour,
one cupful of bread crumbs and between four and five pounds of any kind
of white fish--cusk, cod, haddock, etc., boiled twenty minutes in water
to cover and two table-spoonfuls of salt. Put fish on to boil, then the
cream and milk. Mix the flour with half a cupful of cold milk, and stir
into boiling cream and milk. Cook eight minutes and season highly with
salt and pepper. Remove skin and bones from fish, and break it into
flakes. Put a layer of sauce in a deep escalop dish, and then a layer of
fish, which dredge well with salt (a table-spoonful) and pepper; then
another layer of sauce, again fish, and then sauce. Cover with the bread
crumbs, and bake half an hour. This quantity requires a dish holding a
little over two quarts, or, two smaller dishes will answer. If for the
only solid dish for dinner, this will answer for six persons; but if it
is in a course for a dinner party, it will serve twelve. Cold boiled
fish can be used when you have it. Great care must be taken to remove
every bone when fish is prepared with a sauce, (as when it is served <i>&agrave;
la cr&egrave;me</i>, escaloped, &amp;c.), because one cannot look for
bones then as when the sauce is served separately.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Turbot &agrave; la Cr&egrave;me</span>.</p>
<p>Boil five or six pounds of haddock. Take out all bones, and shred
the fish very fine. Let a quart of milk, a quarter of an onion and a
piece of parsley come to a boil; then stir in a scant cupful of flour,
which has been mixed with a cupful of cold milk, and the yolks of two
eggs. Season with half a teaspoonful of white pepper, the same quantity
of thyme, half a cupful of butter, and well with salt. Butter a pan, and
put in first a layer of sauce, then one of fish. Finish with sauce, and
over it sprinkle cracker crumbs and a light grating of cheese. Bake for
an hour in a moderate oven.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Matelote of Codfish.</p>
<p>Cut off the head of a codfish weighing five pounds. Remove bones
from the fish, and fill it with a dressing made of half a pint of
oysters, a scant pint of bread crumbs, a fourth of a teaspoonful of
pepper, two teaspoonfuls of salt, two table-spoonfuls of butter, half an
onion, an egg and half a table-spoonful of chopped parsley. Place five
slices of pork both under and over the fish. Boil the bones in a pint of
water, and pour this around the fish. Bake an hour, and baste often with
gravy and butter. Have a bouquet in the corner of the baking pan. Make a
gravy, and pour around the fish. Then garnish with fried smelts.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Smelts &agrave; la Tartare.</p>
<p>Clean the smelts by drawing them between the finger and thumb,
beginning at the tail. This will press out the insides at the opening at
the gills. Wash them, and drain in the colander; salt well, and dip in
beaten egg and bread or cracker crumbs (one egg and one cupful of crumbs
to twelve smelts, unless these are very large). Dip first in the egg,
and then roll in the crumbs. Fry in boiling fat deep enough to float
them. They should be a handsome brown in two minutes and a half. Take
them up, and place on a sheet of brown paper for a few moments, to
drain; then place on a hot dish. Garnish with parsley and a few slices
of lemon, and serve with Tartare sauce in a separate dish; or, they may
be served without the sauce.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Smelts as a Garnish,</p>
<p>Smelts are often fried, as for <i>&agrave; la Tartare</i>; or,
rolled in meal or flour, and then fried, they are used to garnish other
kinds of fish. With baked fish they are arranged around the dish in any
form that the taste of the cook may dictate; but in garnishing fish, or
any other dish, the arrangement should always be simple, so as not to
make the matter of serving any harder than if the dish were not
garnished. Smelts are also seasoned well with salt and pepper, dipped in
butter and afterwards in flour, and placed in a very hot oven for eight
or ten minutes to get a handsome brown. They are then served as a
garnish or on slices of buttered toast. When smelts are used as a
garnish, serve one on each plate with the other fish. If you wish to
have the smelts in rings, for a garnish, fasten the tails in the opening
at the gills, with little wooden tooth picks; then dip them in the
beaten egg and in the crumbs, place in the frying basket and plunge into
the boiling fat. When they are cooked take out the skewers, and they
will retain their shape.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Fish au Gratin</span>.</p>
<p>Any kind of light fish--that is, cod, cusk, flounder, etc. Skin the
fish by starting at the head and drawing down towards the tail; then
take out the bones. Cut the fish into pieces about three inches square,
and salt and pepper well. Butter such a dish, as you would use for
escolloped oysters. Put in one layer of fish, then moisten well with
sauce; add more fish and sauce, and finally cover with fine bread
crumbs. Bake half an hour. The dish should be rather shallow, allowing
only two layers of fish.</p>
<p>Sauce for <i>au gratin</i>: One pint of stock, three
table-spoonfuls of butter, two of flour, juice of half a lemon, half a
table-spoonful of chopped parsley, a slice of onion, the size of half a
dollar, and about as thick--chopped very fine, (one table-spoonful of
onion juice is better); one table-spoonful of vinegar, salt, pepper.
Heat the butter in a small frying-pan, and when hot, add the dry flour.
Stir constantly until a rich brown; then add, gradually, the cold stock,
stirring all the time. As soon as it boils, season well with salt and
pepper, and then add the other seasoning. This quantity is enough for
three pounds of fish, weighed after being skinned and boned, and will
serve six persons if it is the only solid dish for dinner, or ten if
served in a course.</p>
<p>Another way to serve fish <i>au gratin</i>, is to skin it, cut off
the head, and take out the back-bone; and there are then two large
pieces of fish. Season the fish, and prepare the sauce as before. Butter
a tin sheet that will fit loosely into a large baking-pan. Lay the fish
on this, and moisten well with the sauce. Cover thickly with bread
crumbs, and cook twenty-five minutes in a rather quick oven. Then slip
on a hot dish, and serve with tomato, Tartare or Hollandaise sauce
poured around the fish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Eels &agrave; la Tartare.</p>
<p>Cut the eels into pieces about four inches long. Cover them with
boiling water, in which let them stand five minutes, and then drain
them. Now dip in beaten egg, which has been well salted and peppered,
then in bread or cracker crumbs. Fry in boiling fat for five minutes.
Have Tartare sauce spread in the centre of a cold dish. Place the fried
eels in a circle on this, garnish with parsley, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Stewed Eels.</p>
<p>Cut two eels in pieces about four inches long. Put three large
table-spoonfuls of butter into the stew-pan with half a small onion. As
soon as the onion begins to turn yellow stir in two table-spoonfuls of
flour, and stir until brown. Add one pint of stock, if you have it; if
not, use water. Season well with pepper and salt; then put in the eels
and two bay leaves. Cover, and simmer gently three-quarters of an hour.
Heap the eels in the centre of a hot dish, strain the sauce over them
and garnish with toasted bread and parsley. If you wish, add a
table-spoonful of vinegar or lemon juice to the stew.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><a name="6OYSTERS"></a>OYSTERS.</big></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> On the Half Shell.</p>
<p>Not until just before serving should they be opened. Marketmen often
furnish some one to do this. Six large oysters are usually allowed each
person. Left in half the shell, they are placed on a dinner plate, with
a thin slice of lemon in the centre of the dish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> On a Block of Ice.</p>
<p>Having a perfectly clear and solid block of ice, weighing ten or
fifteen pounds, a cavity is to be made in the top of it in either of two
ways. The first is to carefully chip with an ice pick; the other, to
melt with heated bricks. If the latter be chosen the ice must be put
into a tub or large pan, and one of the bricks held upon the centre of
it until there is a slight depression, yet sufficient for the brick to
rest in. When the first brick is cold remove it, tip the block on one
side, to let off the water, and then use another brick. Continue the
operation till the cavity will hold as many oysters as are to be served.
These should be kept an hour previous in a cool place; should be drained
in a colander, and seasoned with salt, pepper and vinegar. After laying
two folded napkins on a large platter, to prevent the block from
slipping, cover the dish with parsley, so that only the ice is visible.
Stick a number of pinks, or of any small, bright flowers that do not
wilt rapidly, into the parsley. Pour oysters into the space in the top
of the ice, and garnish with thin slices of lemon. This gives an elegant
dish, and does away with the unsightly shells in which raw oysters are
usually served. It is not expensive, for the common oysters do as well
as those of good size. Indeed, as many ladies dislike the large ones,
here is an excellent substitute for serving in the shell, particularly
as the oysters require no seasoning when once on the table. A quart is
enough for a party of ten; but a block of the size given will hold two
quarts.</p>
<p> Roasted Oysters on Toast.</p>
<p>Eighteen large oysters, or thirty small ones, one teaspoonful of
flour, one table-spoonful of butter, salt, pepper, three slices of
toast. Have the toast buttered and on a hot dish. Put the butter in a
small sauce-pan, and when hot, add the dry flour. Stir until smooth, but
not brown; then add the cream, and let it boil up once. Put the oysters
(in their own liquor) into a hot oven, for three minutes; then add them
to the cream. Season, and pour over the toast. Garnish the dish with
thin slices of lemon, and serve very hot. It is nice for lunch or tea.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Oysters Panned in their Own Liquor.</p>
<p>Eighteen large, or thirty small, oysters, one table-spoonful of
butter, one of cracker crumbs, salt and pepper to taste, one teaspoonful
of lemon juice, a speck of cayenne. Put the oysters on in their own
liquor, and when they boil up, add seasoning, butter and crumbs. Cook
one minute, and serve on toast.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Oysters Panned in the Shell.</p>
<p>Wash the shells and wipe dry. Place them in a pan with the round
shell down. Set in a hot oven for three minutes; then take out, and
remove the upper shell. Put two or three oysters into one of the round
shells, season with pepper and salt, add butter, the size of two peas,
and cover with cracker or bread crumbs. Return to the oven and brown.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Oyster Saut&eacute;.</p>
<p>Two dozen large, or three dozen small, oysters, two table-spoonfuls
of butter, four of fine cracker crumbs, salt, pepper. Let the oysters
drain in the colander. Then season with salt and pepper and roll in the
crumbs. Have the butter very hot in a frying-pan, and put in enough of
the oysters to cover the bottom of the pan. Fry crisp and brown, being
careful not to burn. Serve on hot, crisp toast.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Oysters Roasted in the Shell.</p>
<p>Wash the shells clean, and wipe dry. Place in a baking pan, and put
in a hot oven for about twenty minutes. Serve on hot dishes the moment
they are taken from the oven. Though this is not an elegant dish, many
people enjoy it, as the first and best flavor of the oysters is retained
in this manner of cooking. The oysters can, instead, be opened into a
hot dish and seasoned with butter, salt, pepper and lemon juice. They
should be served immediately.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Little Pigs in Blankets.</p>
<p>Season large oysters with salt and pepper. Cut fat English bacon in
very thin slices, wrap an oyster in each slice, and fasten with a little
wooden skewer (toothpicks are the best things). Heat a frying-pan and
put in the "little pigs." Cook just long enough to crisp the
bacon--about two minutes. Place on slices of toast that have been cut
into small pieces, and serve immediately. Do not remove the skewers.
This is a nice relish for lunch or tea; and, garnished with parsley, is
a pretty one. The pan must be very hot before the "pigs" are put in, and
then great care must be taken that they do not burn.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Fricasseed Oysters.</p>
<p>One hundred oysters (about two quarts), four large table-spoonfuls
of butter, one teaspoonful of chopped parsley, one table-spoonful of
flour, a speck of cayenne, salt, yolks of three eggs. Brown two
table-spoonfuls of the butter, and add to it the parsley, cayenne and
salt and the oysters, well drained. Mix together the flour and the
remainder of the butter and stir into the oysters when they begin to
curl. Then add yolks, well beaten, and take immediately from the fire.
Serve on a hot dish with a garnish of fried bread and parsley.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Creamed Oysters.</p>
<p>A pint of cream, one quart of oysters, a small piece of onion, a
very small piece of mace, a table-spoonful of flour, and salt and pepper
to taste. Let the cream, with the onion and mace, come to a boil. Mix
flour with a little cold milk or cream, and stir into the boiling cream.
Let the oysters come to a boil in their own liquor, and skim carefully.
Drain off all the liquor, and turn the oysters into the cream. Skim out
the mace and onions, and serve.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Cr&ocirc;ustade of Oysters</span>.</p>
<p>Have a loaf of bread baked in a round two-quart basin. When two or
three days old, with a sharp knife cut out the heart of the bread, being
careful not to break the crust. Break up the crumbs very fine, and dry
them slowly in an oven; then quickly fry three cupfuls of them in two
table-spoonfuls of butter. As soon as they begin to look golden and are
crisp, they are done. It takes about two minutes over a hot fire,
stirring all the time. Put one quart of cream to boil, and when it
boils, stir in three table-spoonfuls of flour, which has been mixed with
half a cupful of cold milk. Cook eight minutes. Season well with salt
and pepper. Put a layer of the sauce into the <i>cr&ocirc;ustade</i>
then a layer of oysters, which dredge well with salt and pepper; then
another layer of sauce and one of fried crumbs. Continue this until the <i>cr&ocirc;ustade</i>
is nearly full, having the last layer a thick one of crumbs. It takes
three pints of oysters for this dish, and about three teaspoonfuls of
salt and half a teaspoonful of pepper. Bake slowly half an hour. Serve
with a garnish of parsley around the dish,</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Escaloped Oysters.</p>
<p>Two quarts of oysters, half a cupful of butter, half a cupful of
cream or milk, four teaspoonfuls of salt, half a teaspoonful of pepper,
two quarts of stale bread crumbs, and spice, if you choose. Butter the
escalop dishes, and put in a layer of crumbs and then one of oysters.
Dredge with the salt and pepper, and put small pieces of butter here and
there in the dish. Now have another layer of oysters, seasoning as
before; then add the milk, and, finally, a thick layer of crumbs, which
dot with butter. Bake twenty minutes in a rather quick oven. The crumbs
must be light and flakey. The quantity given above is enough to fill two
dishes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Escaloped Oysters, No. 2.</p>
<p>Put a layer of rolled crackers in an oval dish, and then a layer of
oysters, and lay on small pieces of butter. Dredge with salt and pepper,
and moisten well with milk (or equal parts of milk and water). Add
another layer of cracker and of oysters, and butter, dredge and moisten
as before. Continue these alternate layers until the dish is nearly
full; then cover with a thin layer of cracker and pieces of butter. If
the dish be a large one, holding about two quarts, it will require an
hour and a half or two hours to bake.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Oysters Served in Escalop Shells.</p>
<p>The shells may be tin, granite-ware, or silver-plated, or, the
natural oyster or scollop shells. The ingredients are: one quart of
oysters, half a pint of cream or milk, one pint of bread crumbs, one
table-spoonful of butter, if cream is used, or three, if milk; salt and
pepper, a grating of nutmeg and two table-spoonfuls of flour. Drain all
the liquor from the oysters into a stew-pan. Let it come to a boil, and
skim; then add the cream or milk, with which the flour should first be
mixed. Let this boil two minutes, and add the butter, salt, pepper and
nutmeg, and then the oysters. Take from the fire immediately. Taste to
see if seasoned enough. Have the shells buttered, and sprinkled lightly
with crumbs. Nearly fill them with the prepared oysters; then cover
thickly with crumbs. Put the shells in a baking-pan, and bake fifteen
minutes. Serve very hot, on a large platter, which garnish with parsley.
The quantity given above will fill twelve common-sized shells.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Oyster Chartreuse.</p>
<p>One quart of oysters, one pint of cream, one small slice of onion,
half a cupful of milk, whites of four eggs, two table-spoonfuls of
butter, salt, pepper, two table-spoonfuls of flour, one cupful of fine,
dry bread crumbs, six potatoes. Pare and boil the potatoes. Mash fine
and light, and add the milk, salt, pepper, one spoonful of butter, and
then the whites of the eggs, beaten to a stiff froth. Have a two-quart
charlotte russe mould well buttered, and sprinkle the bottom and sides
with the bread crumbs (there must be butter enough to hold the crumbs).
Line the mould with the potato, and let stand for a few minutes. Put the
cream and onion on to boil. Mix the flour with a little cold milk or
cream--about one-fourth of a cupful--and stir into the boiling cream.
Season well with salt and pepper, and cook eight minutes. Let the
oysters come to a boil in their own liquor. Skim them, and drain of all
the juice. Take the piece of onion from the sauce, and add the oysters.
Taste to see if seasoned enough, and turn gently into the mould. Cover
with the remainder of the potato, being careful not to put on too much
at once, as in that case the sauce would be forced to the top. When
covered, bake half an hour in a hot oven. Take from the oven ten minutes
before dishing time, and let it stand on the table. Place a large
platter over the mould and turn both dish and mould at the same time.
Remove the mould very gently. Garnish the dish with parsley, and serve.
A word of caution: Every part of the mould must have a thick coating of
the mashed potato, and when the covering of potato is put on no opening
must be left for sauce to escape.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> To Pickle Oysters</span>.</p>
<p>Two hundred large oysters, half a pint of vinegar, half a pint of
white wine, four spoonfuls of salt, six spoonfuls of whole black pepper
and a little mace. Strain the liquor, and add the above-named
ingredients. Let boil up once, and pour, while boiling hot, over the
oysters. After these have stood ten minutes pour off the liquor, which,
as well as the oysters, should then be allowed to get cold. Put into a
jar and cover tight. The oysters will keep some time.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><a name="6LOBSTER"></a>LOBSTER.</big></p>
<p>Lobster, to be eatable, should be perfectly fresh. One of the tests
of freshness is to draw back the tail, for if it springs into position
again, it is safe to think the fish good. The time of boiling varies
with the size of the lobster and in different localities. In Boston,
Rockport and other places on the Massachusetts coast the time is fifteen
or twenty minutes for large lobsters and ten for small. The usual way is
to plunge them into boiling water enough to cover, and to continue
boiling them until they are done. Some people advocate putting the
lobsters into cold water, and letting this come to a boil gradually.
They claim that the lobsters do not suffer so much. This may be so, but
it seems as if death must instantly follow the plunge into boiling
water. Cooking a lobster too long makes it tough and dry. When, on
opening a lobster, you find the meat clinging to the shell, and very
much shrunken, you may be sure the time of boiling was too long. There
are very few modes of cooking lobster in which it should be more than
thoroughly heated, as much cooking toughens it and destroys the fine,
delicate flavor of the meat.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> To open a lobster.</p>
<p>Separate the tail from the body, and shake out the tom-ally, and,
also, the "coral," if there is any, upon a plate. Then by drawing the
body from the shell with the thumb, and pressing the part near the head
against the shell with the first and second finger, you will free it
from the stomach or "lady." Now split the lobster through the centre
and, with a fork, pick the meat from the joints. Cut the under side of
the tail shell open and take out the meat without breaking. On the upper
part of that end of this meat which joined the body is a small piece of
flesh, which should be lifted; and a strip of meat attached to it should
be turned back to the extreme end of the tail. This will uncover a
little vein, running the entire length, which must be removed. Sometimes
this vein is dark, and sometimes as light as the meat itself. It and the
stomach are the only parts not eatable. The piece that covered the vein
should be turned again into place. Hold the claws on edge on a thick
board, and strike hard with a hammer until the shell cracks. Draw apart,
and take out the meat. If you have the claws lying flat on the board
when you strike, you not only break the shell, but mash the meat, and
thus spoil a fine dish. Remember that the stomach of the lobster is
found near the head, and is a small, hard sack containing poisonous
matter; and that the intestinal vein is found in the tail. These should
always be carefully removed. When lobster is opened in the manner
explained it may be arranged handsomely on a dish, and each person can
season it at the table to suit himself.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Lobster Broiled in the Shell.</p>
<p>Divide the tail into two parts, cutting lengthwise. Break the large
claws in two parts, and free the body from the small claws and stomach.
Replace the body in the shell. Put the meat from the claws in half of
the shells it came from, and put the other half of the shells where they
will get hot. Put the lobster into the double broiler, and cook, with
the meat side exposed to the fire, for eight minutes; then turn, and
cook ten minutes longer. Place on a hot dish, and season slightly with
salt and cayenne, and then well with <i>ma&icirc;tre d' h&ocirc;tel</i>
butter. Cover the claws with the hot shells. Garnish the dish with
parsley, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Broiled Lobster.</p>
<p>Split the meat of the tail and claws, and season well with salt and
pepper. Cover with soft butter and dredge with flour. Place in the
broiler, and cook over a bright fire until a delicate brown. Arrange on
a hot dish, pour Bechamel sauce around, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Breaded Lobster.</p>
<p>Split the meat of the tail and claws, and season well with salt and
pepper. Dip in beaten egg and then in bread crumbs, which let dry on the
meat; and then repeat the operation. Place in a frying-basket, and
plunge into boiling fat. Cook till a golden brown--about two minutes.
Serve with Tartare sauce.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Stewed Lobster.</p>
<p>The meat of a two and a half pound lobster, cut into dice; two
table-spoonfuls of butter, two of flour, one pint of stock or water, a
speck of cayenne, salt and pepper to taste. Let the butter get hot, and
add the dry flour. Stir until perfectly smooth, when add the water,
gradually, stirring all the while. Season to taste. Add the lobster;
heat thoroughly, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Curry of Lobster.</p>
<p>The meat of a lobster weighing between two and three pounds, one
very small onion, three table-spoonfuls of butter, two of flour, a scant
one of curry powder, a speck of cayenne, salt, a scant pint of water or
stock. Let the butter get hot; and then add the onion, cut fine, and fry
brown. When the onion is cooked add the flour and curry powder, and stir
all together for two minutes. Add stock; cook two minutes, and strain.
Add the meat of lobster, cut into dice, and simmer five minutes. Serve
with a border of boiled rice around the dish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Devilled Lobster in the Shell.</p>
<p>Two lobsters, each weighing about two and a half pounds; one pint of
cream, two table-spoonfuls of butter, two of flour, one of mustard, a
speck of cayenne, salt, pepper, a scant pint of bread crumbs. Open the
lobster and, with a sharp knife, cut the meat rather fine. Be careful,
in opening, not to break the body or tail shells. Wash these shells and
wipe dry; join them in the form of a boat, that they may hold the
prepared meat. Put the cream on to boil. Mix the butter, flour, mustard
and pepper together, and add three spoonfuls of the boiling cream. Stir
all into the remaining cream, and cook two minutes. Add the lobster,
salt and pepper, and boil one minute. Fill the shells with the mixture,
and place in a pan, with something to keep them in position (a few small
stones answer very well). Cover with the bread crumbs, and brown for
twenty minutes in a hot oven. Serve on a long, narrow dish; the body in
the centre, the tails at either end. Garnish with parsley. If for a
large company, it would be best to have a broad dish, and have four
lobsters, instead of two. This is a very handsome dish, and is really
not hard to cook. There is always a little more of the prepared lobster
than will go into the shells without crowding, and this is nice warmed
and served on slices of crisp toast.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Escaloped Lobster.</p>
<p>Prepare the lobster as for devilling, omitting, however, the
mustard. Turn into a buttered escollop dish, and cover thickly with
crumbs. Brown in a hot oven, and serve.</p>
<p>White stock may be used instead of the cream. Many people who cannot
eat lobster when prepared with cream or milk, find it palatable when
prepared with stock or water.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Lobster Cutlets.</p>
<p>A lobster weighing between two and a half and three pounds, three
table-spoonfuls of butter, half a cupful of stock or cream, one heaping
table-spoonful of flour, a speck of cayenne, salt, two eggs, about a
pint of bread crumbs, twelve sprigs of parsley. Cut the meat of the
lobster into fine dice, and season with salt and pepper. Put the butter
on to heat. Add the flour, and when smooth, add the stock and one
well-beaten egg. Season. Boil up once, add the lobster, and take from
the fire immediately. Now add a table-spoonful of lemon juice. Butter a
platter, and pour the mixture upon it, to the thickness of about an
inch. Make perfectly smooth with a knife, and set away to cool. When
cool, cut into chops, to resemble cutlets. Dip in beaten egg and then in
bread crumbs, being sure to have every part covered. Place in the
frying-basket and plunge into boiling fat. Cook till a rich brown. It
will take about two minutes. Drain for a moment in the basket; then
arrange on a hot dish, and put part of a small claw in each one, to
represent the bone in a cutlet. Put the parsley in the basket and plunge
for a moment into the boiling fat. Garnish with this, or, pour a white
or Bechamel sauce around the dish, and garnish with fresh parsley. The
quantity given will make six or seven cutlets.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Canned Lobster.</p>
<p>Canned lobster can be used for cutlets, stews, curries and patties,
can be escaloped, or served on toast.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><a name="6OTHER"></a> OTHER
SHELL-FISH.</big></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Stewed Terrapins.</p>
<p>Put them into boiling water, and boil rapidly for ten or fifteen
minutes, or until the nails will come out and the black skin rub
off--the time depending upon the size of the fish. After this, put into
fresh boiling water, and boil until the under shell cracks, which will
be about three-quarters of an hour. Remove the under shell, throw away
the sand and gall bags, take out intestines, and put the terrapins to
boil again in the same water for an hour. Pick liver and meat from upper
shell. Cut the intestines in small pieces, and add to this meat. Pour
over all a quantity of the liquor in which the intestines were boiled
sufficient to make very moist. Put away until the next day. For each
terrapin, if of good size, a gill of cream and of wine, half a cupful of
butter, yolks of two hard-boiled eggs, rubbed smooth, salt, pepper and
cayenne are needed. Pour over the terrapin, let it come to a boil, and
serve,--[Mrs. Furness, of Philadelphia.]</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Soft-Shell Crabs.</p>
<p>Lift the shell at both sides and remove the spongy substance found
on the back. Then pull off the "apron," which will be found on the under
side, and to which is attached a substance like that removed from the
back. Now wipe the crabs, and dip them in beaten egg, and then in fine
bread or cracker crumbs. Fry in boiling fat from eight to ten minutes,
the time depending upon the size of the crabs. Serve with Tartare sauce.
Or, the egg and bread crumbs may be omitted. Season with salt and
cayenne, and fry as before,</p>
<p>When broiled, crabs are cleaned, and seasoned with salt and cayenne;
are then dropped into boiling water for one minute, taken up, and
broiled over a hot fire for eight minutes. They are served with <i>ma&icirc;tre
d' h&ocirc;tel</i> butter or Tartare sauce.<br>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><a name="7BOILING"></a>BOILING.</big></p>
<p>All pieces, unless very salt, should be plunged into boiling water,
and boiled rapidly for fifteen minutes, to harden the albumen that is on
the outside, and thus keep in the juices. The kettle should then be put
back where it will just simmer, for meat that is boiled rapidly becomes
hard and stringy, while that which is kept just at the boiling point
(where the water hardly bubbles) will cut tender and juicy, provided
there is any juiciness in it at the beginning. White meats, like mutton
and poultry, are improved in appearance by having rice boiled with them;
or, a still better way is to thickly flour a piece of coarse cotton
cloth, pin the meat in it, and place in the boiling water. Meat cooked
in this way will be extremely juicy.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Leg of Mutton.</p>
<p>Cook, as directed, in boiling water to cover. A leg that weighs
eight or nine pounds will cook in one hour and a quarter if it is wanted
done rare. Allow five minutes for every additional pound. Save the water
for soups.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Lamb.</p>
<p>Cook the same as mutton. Serve with drawn butter.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Boiled Ham.</p>
<p>Wash the ham very clean, and put on with cold water to cover. Simmer
gently five hours, and set the kettle aside for one or two hours. When
nearly cold, take out the ham and draw off the skin. Cover with cracker
crumbs and about three table-spoonfuls of sugar. Place in the oven, in a
baking-pan, for thirty or forty minutes. Many people stick cloves into
the fat part of the ham, and use only a few crumbs. The time given is
for a ham weighing about twelve pounds; every pound over that will
require fifteen minutes more. The fish kettle comes next to a regular
ham kettle, and answers quite as well as both. If you have neither
kettle, and no pot large enough to hold all the meat, cut off the
knuckle, which will cook in about two hours. But this rather hurts the
flavor and appearance of the dish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Salt Tongue.</p>
<p>Soak over night, and cook from five to six hours. Throw into cold
water and peel off the skin.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Fresh Tongue.</p>
<p>Put into boiling water to cover, with two table-spoonfuls of salt.
Cook from five to six hours. Skin the same as salt tongue.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Corned Beef.</p>
<p>Wash, and put into cold water, if very salt; but such a piece as one
finds in town and city shops, and which the butchers corn themselves,
put into boiling water. Cook very slowly for six hours. This time is for
a piece weighing eight or ten pounds. When it is to be served cold let
it stand for one or two hours in the water in which it was boiled. If
the beef is to be pressed, get either a piece of the brisket, flank or
rattle-ran. Take out the bones, place in a flat dish or platter, put a
tin sheet on top, and lay on it two or three bricks. If you have a
corned beef press, use that, of course.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><a name="7ROASTING"></a>ROASTING.</big></p>
<p>There are two modes of roasting: one is to use a tin Kitchen before
an open fire, and the other and more common way is to use a very hot
oven. The former gives the more delicious favor, but the second is not
by any means a poor way, if the meat is put on a rack, and basted
constantly when in the oven. A large piece is best for roasting, this
being especially true of beef. When meat is cooked in a tin kitchen it
requires more time, because the heat is not equally distributed, as it
is in the oven.</p>
<p>To prepare for roasting: Wipe the meat with a wet towel. Dredge on
all sides with salt, pepper and flour; and if the kitchen is used,
dredge the flour into that. Run the spit through the centre of the meat,
and place very near the fire at first, turning as it browns. When the
flour in the kitchen is browned, add a pint of hot water, and baste
frequently with it, dredging with salt and flour after each basting.
Roast a piece of beef weighing eight pounds fifty minutes, if to be
rare, but if to be medium, roast one hour and a quarter, and ten minutes
for each additional pound.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Roasting in the Oven.</p>
<p>Prepare the meat as before. Have a rack that will fit loosely into
the baking-pan. Cover the bottom of the pan rather lightly with flour,
put in rack, and then meat Place in a very hot oven for a few minutes,
to brown the flour in the pan, and then add hot water enough to cover
the bottom of the pan. Close the oven; and in about ten minutes, open,
and baste the meat with the gravy. Dredge with salt, pepper and flour.
Do this every fifteen minutes; and as soon as one side of the meat is
brown, turn, and brown the other. Make gravy as before. Allow a quarter
of an hour less in the oven than in the tin kitchen. The heat for
roasting must be very great at first, to harden the albumen, and thus
keep in the juices. After the meat is crusted over it is not necessary
to keep up so great a heat, but for rare meats the heat must, of course,
be greater than for those that are to be well done. The kitchen can be
drawn back a little distance from the fire and the drafts closed.
Putting salt on fresh meat draws out the juices, but by using flour a
paste is formed, which, keeps in all the juices and also enriches and
browns the piece. Never roast meat without having a rack in the pan. If
meat is put into the water in the pan it becomes soggy and looses its
flavor. A meat rack costs not more than thirty or forty cents, and the
improvement in the looks and flavor of a piece of meat is enough to pay
for it in one roasting. The time given for roasting a piece of beef is
for rib roasts and sirloin. The same weight in the face or the back of
the rump will require twenty minutes longer, as the meat on these cuts
is in a very compact form. If a saddle or loin of mutton is to be
roasted, cook the same time as beef if the weight is the same; but if a
leg is to be roasted, one hour and a quarter is the time. Lamb should be
cooked an hour and a half; veal, two hours and three-quarters; pork,
three hours and a quarter. Ten minutes before dishing the dinner turn
the gravy into a sauce-pan, skim off all the fat, and set on the stove.
Let it come to a boil; then stir in one table-spoonful of flour, mixed
with half a cupful of cold water. Season with salt and pepper, and cook
two minutes. Serve the meat on a hot dish and the gravy in a hot tureen.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Boiled Rib Roast.</p>
<p>Either have the butcher remove the bones, or do it your-self by
slipping a sharp knife between the flesh and bones--a simple matter with
almost any kind of meat. Roll up the piece and tie with strong twine.
Treat the same as plain roast beef, giving the same time as if it were a
piece of rump (one hour and a half for eight pounds), as the form it is
now in does not readily admit the heat to all parts. This piece of beef
can be larded before roasting, or it can be larded and braised. Serve
with tomato or horse-radish sauce.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Roast Beef, with Yorkshire Pudding.</p>
<p>A rib or sirloin roast should be prepared as directed for roasting.
When within three-quarters of an hour of being done, have the pudding
made. Butter a pan like that in which the meat is being cooked, and pour
in the batter. Put the rack across the pan, not in it. Place the meat on
the rack, return to the oven, and cook forty-five minutes. If you have
only one pan, take up the meat, pour off the gravy and put in the
pudding. Cut in squares, and garnish the beef with these. Another method
is to have a pan that has squares stamped in it. This gives even squares
and crust on all the edges, which baking in the flat pan does not. When
the meat is roasted in the tin-kitchen, let the pudding bake in the oven
for half an hour, and then place it under the meat to catch the
drippings.</p>
<p>For the Yorkshire pudding, one pint of milk, two-thirds of a cupful
of flour, three eggs and one scant teaspoonful of salt will be needed.
Beat the eggs very light. Add salt and milk, and then pour about half a
cupful of the mixture upon the flour; and when perfectly smooth, add the
remainder. This makes a small pudding--about enough for six persons.
Serve it hot.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Fillet of Veal, Roasted.</p>
<p>About eight or ten pounds of the fillet, ham force-meat (see rule
for force-meat), half a cupful of butter, half a teaspoonful of pepper,
two table-spoonfuls of salt, two lemons, half a pound of salt pork. Rub
the salt and pepper into the veal; then fill the cavity, from which the
bone was taken, with the force-meat. Skewer and tie the fillet into a
round shape. Cut the pork in thin slices, and put half of these on a tin
sheet that will fit into the dripping pan; place this in the pan, and
the fillet on it. Cover the veal with the remainder of the pork. Put hot
water enough in the pan to just cover the bottom, and place in the oven.
Bake slowly for four hours, basting frequently with the gravy in the
pan, and with salt, pepper and flour. As the water in the pan cooks
away, it must be renewed, remembering to have only enough to keep the
meat and pan from burning. After it has been cooking three hours, take
the pork from the top of the fillet, spread the top thickly with butter
and dredge with flour. Repeat this after thirty minutes, and then brown
handsomely. Put the remainder of the butter, which should be about three
table-spoonfuls, in a sauce-pan, and when hot, add two heaping
table-spoonfuls of flour, and stir until dark brown. Add to it half a
pint of stock or water; stir a minute, and set back where it will keep
warm, but not cook. Now take up the fillet, and skim all the fat off of
the gravy; add water enough to make half a pint of gravy, also the sauce
just made. Let this boil up, and add the juice of half a lemon, and more
salt and pepper, if needed. Strain, and pour around the fillet. Garnish
the dish with potato puffs and slices of lemon.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Roast Ham.</p>
<p>Prepare the ham as for boiling, and if it is of good size (say ten
pounds), boil three hours. Remove the skin, and put the ham in a baking
pan. Let it cook two hours in a moderate oven. Serve with champagne
sauce.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><a name="7BROILING"></a> BROILING.</big></p>
<p>The fire for broiling must be clear, and for meats it must be hotter
and brighter than for fish. Coals from hard wood or charcoal are best,
but in all large towns and cities hard coal is nearly always used,
except in hotels and restaurants, where there is usually a special place
for broiling with charcoal. The double broiler is the very best thing in
the market for broiling meats and fish. When the meat is placed in it,
and the slide is slipped over the handles, all there is to do is to hold
the broiler over the fire, or, if you have an open range, before the
fire. A fork or knife need not go near the meat until it is on the dish.
A great amount of the juice is saved. With the old-fashioned gridirons
it is absolutely necessary to stick a fork into the meat to turn it, and
although there are little grooves for the gravy to run into, what is
saved in this way does not compare with what is actually kept within the
meat where the double broiler is used. Professional cooks can turn a
steak without running a fork into the meat, but not one in a hundred
common cooks can do it.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Mutton Chops.</p>
<p>Sprinkle the chops with salt, pepper and flour. Put them in the
double broiler. Broil over or before the fire for eight minutes. Serve
on a <i>hot</i> dish with butter, salt and pepper for tomato sauce. The
fire for chops should not be as hot as for steak. Chops can be seasoned
with salt and pepper, wrapped in buttered paper and broiled ten minutes
over a hot fire.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Beef Steak.</p>
<p>Have it cut thick. It will never be good, rich and juicy if only
from one-fourth to one-half an inch thick. It ought to be at least
three-quarters of an inch thick. Trim off any suet that may be left on
it, and dredge with salt, pepper and flour. Cook in the double broiler,
over or before clear coals, for ten minutes, if to be rare, twelve, if
to be rather well done. Turn the meat constantly. Serve on a hot dish
with butter and salt, or with mushroom sauce, <i>maitre d' H&ocirc;tel</i>
butter or tomato sauce. Do not stick a knife or fork into the meat to
try it. This is the way many people spoil it. Pounding is another bad
habit: much of the juice of the meat is lost. When, as it sometimes
happens, there is no convenience for broiling, heat the frying pan very
hot, then sprinkle with salt, and lay in the steak. Turn frequently.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><a name="7MISCELLANEOUS"></a>
MISCELLANEOUS MODES.</big></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Braised Beef.</p>
<p>Take six or eight pounds of the round or the face of the rump, and
lard with quarter of a pound of salt pork. Put six slices of pork in the
bottom of the braising pan, and as soon as it begins to fry, add two
onions, half a small carrot and half a small turnip, all cut fine. Cook
these until they begin to brown; then draw them to one side of the pan
and put in the beef, which has been well dredged with salt, pepper and
flour. Brown on all sides, and then add one quart of boiling water and a
bouquet of sweet herbs; cover, and cook <i>slowly</i> in the oven for
four hours, basting every twenty minutes. Take up, and finish the gravy
as for braised tongue. Or, add to the gravy half a can of tomatoes, and
cook for ten minutes. Strain, pour around the beef, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Fricandeau of Veal.</p>
<p>Have a piece of veal, weighing about eight pounds, cut from that
part of the leg called the cushion. Wet the vegetable masher, and beat
the veal smooth; then lard one side thickly. Put eight slices of pork in
the bottom of the braising-pan; place the veal on this, larded side up.
Add two small onions, half a small turnip, two slices of carrot, one
clove and a bouquet of sweet herbs--these to be at the sides of the
meat, not on top; and one quart of white stock or water. Dredge with
salt, pepper and flour. Cover, and place in a rather moderate oven. Cook
three hours, basting every fifteen minutes. If cooked rapidly the meat
will be dry and stringy, but if slowly, it will be tender and juicy.
When done, lift carefully from the pan. Melt four table-spoonfuls of
glaze, and spread on the meat with a brush. Place in the open oven for
five minutes. Add one cupful of hot water to the contents of the
braising-pan. Skim off all the fat, and then add one heaping teaspoonful
of corn-starch, which has been mixed with a little cold water. Let it
boil one minute; then strain, and return to the fire. Add two
table-spoonfuls of glaze, and when this is melted, pour the sauce around
the fricandeau, and serve. Potato balls, boiled for twelve minutes in
stock, and then slightly browned in the oven, make a pretty garnish for
this dish. It is also served on a bed of finely-chopped spinach or
mashed potatoes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Leg of Lamb &agrave; la Fran&ccedil;aise.</p>
<p>Put a leg of lamb, weighing about eight pounds, in as small a kettle
as will hold it. Put in a muslin bag one onion, one small white turnip,
a few green celery leaves, three sprigs each of sweet marjoram and
summer savory, four cloves and twelve allspice. Tie the bag and place it
in the kettle with the lamb; then pour on two quarts of boiling water.
Let this come to a boil, and then skim carefully. Now add four heaping
table-spoonfuls of flour, which has been mixed with one cupful of cold
water, two table-spoonfuls of salt and a speck of cayenne. Cover tight,
and set back where it will just simmer for four hours. In the meantime
make a pint and a half of veal or mutton force-meat, which make into
little balls and fry brown. Boil six eggs hard. At the end of four hours
take up the Iamb. Skim all the fat off of the gravy and take out the bag
of seasoning. Now put the kettle where the contents will boil rapidly
for ten minutes. Put three table-spoonfuls of butter in the frying-pan,
and when hot, stir in two of flour; cook until a dark brown, but not
burned, and stir into the gravy. Taste to see if seasoned enough. Have
the whites and yolks of the hard-boiled eggs chopped separately. Pour
the gravy over the lamb; then garnish with the chopped eggs, making a
hill of the whites, and capping it with part of the yolks. Sprinkle the
remainder of the yolks over the lamb. Place the meat balls in groups
around the dish. Garnish with parsley, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Braised Breast of Lamb.</p>
<p>With a sharp knife, remove the bones from a breast of lamb; then
season it well with salt and pepper, and roll up and tie firmly with
twine. Put two table-spoonfuls of butter in the braising-pan, and when
melted, add one onion, one slice of carrot and one of turnip, all cut
fine. Stir for five minutes, and then put in the lamb, with a thick
dredging of flour. Cover, and set back, where it will not cook rapidly,
for half an hour; then add one quart of stock or boiling water, and
place in the oven, where it will cook <i>slowly</i>, for one hour.
Baste often. Take up the meat, skim all the fat off of the gravy, and
then put it where it will boil rapidly for five minutes. Take the string
from the meat. Strain the gravy, and pour over the dish. Serve very hot.
Or serve with tomato or Bechamel sauce. The bones should be put in the
pan with the meat, to improve the gravy.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Beef Stew.</p>
<p>Two pounds of beef (the round, flank, or any cheap part; if there is
bone in it, two and a half pounds will be required), one onion, two
slices of carrot, two of turnip, two potatoes, three table-spoonfuls of
flour, salt, pepper, and a generous quart of water. Cut all the fat from
the meat, and put it in a stew-pan; fry gently for ten or fifteen
minutes. In the meantime cut the meat in small pieces, and season well
with salt and pepper, and then sprinkle over it two table-spoonfuls of
flour. Cut the vegetables in very small pieces, and put in the pot with
the fat. Fry them five minutes, stirring well, to prevent burning. Now
put in the meat, and move it about in the pot until it begins to brown;
then add the quart of boiling water. Cover; let it boil up once, skim,
and set back, where it will just bubble, for two and a half hours. Add
the potatoes, cut in thin slices, and one table-spoonful of flour, which
mix smooth with half a cupful of cold water, pouring about one-third of
the water on the flour at first, and adding the rest when perfectly
smooth. Taste to see if the stew is seasoned enough, and if it is not,
add more salt and pepper. Let the stew come to a boil again, and cook
ten minutes; then add dumplings. Cover tightly, and boil rapidly ten
minutes longer.</p>
<p>Mutton, lamb or veal can be cooked in this manner. When veal is
used, fry out two slices of pork, as there will not be much fat on the
meat. Lamb and mutton must have some of the fat put aside, as there is
so much on these meats that they are otherwise very gross.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Irish Stew.</p>
<p>About two pounds of the neck of mutton, four onions, six large
potatoes, salt, pepper, three pints of water and two table-spoonfuls of
flour. Cut the mutton in handsome pieces. Put about half the fat in the
stew-pan, with the onions, and stir for eight or ten minutes over a hot
fire; then put in the meat, which sprinkle with the flour, salt and
pepper. Stir ten minutes, and add the water, boiling. Set for one hour
where it will simmer; then add the potatoes, peeled, and cut in
quarters. Simmer an hour longer, and serve. You can cook dumplings with
this dish, if you choose. They are a great addition to all kinds of
stews and ragouts.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Toad in the Hole.</p>
<p>This is an English dish, and a good one, despite the unpleasant
name. One pound of round steak, one pint of milk, one cupful of flour,
one egg, and salt and pepper. Cut the steak into dice. Beat the egg very
light; add milk to it, and then half a teaspoonful of salt. Pour upon
the flour, gradually, beating very light and smooth. Butter a two-quart
dish, and in it put the meat. Season well, and pour over it the batter.
Bake an hour in a moderate oven. Serve hot. This dish can be made with
mutton and lamb in place of steak.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Scotch Roll.</p>
<p>Remove the tough skin from about five pounds of the flank of beef. A
portion of the meat will be found thicker than the rest. With a sharp
knife, cut a thin layer from the thick part, and lay upon the thin. Mix
together three table-spoonfuls of salt, one of sugar, half a teaspoonful
of pepper, one-eighth of a teaspoonful of clove and one teaspoonful of
summer savory. Sprinkle this over the meat, and then sprinkle with three
table-spoonfuls of vinegar. Roll up, and tie with twine. Put away in a
cold place for twelve hours When it has stood this time, place in a
stew-pan, with boiling water to cover, and simmer gently for three hours
and a half. Mix four heaping table-spoonfuls of flour with half a cupful
of cold water, and stir into the gravy. Season to taste with salt and
pepper. Simmer half an hour longer. This dish is good hot or cold.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><big><a name="POULTRY"></a> POULTRY
AND GAME.</big></big></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> To Clean and Truss Poultry.</p>
<p>First singe, by holding the bird over a blazing paper. It is best to
do this over the open stove, when all the particles of burnt paper will
fall into the fire. Next open the vent and draw out the internal organs,
if this has not been done at the butcher's. Be careful not to break the
gall bladder. Wash quickly in one water. If there are large black
pin-feathers, take out what you can with the point of a knife, (it is
impossible to get out all). Cut the oil bag from the tail. Be sure that
you have taken out every part of the wind-pipe, the lights and crop.
Turn the skin back, and cut the neck quite short. Fill the crop with
dressing, and put some in the body also. With a short skewer, fasten the
legs together at the joint where the feet were cut off. [Be careful, in
cutting off the feet of game or poultry, to cut in the joint. If you cut
above, the ligaments that hold the flesh and bones together will be
severed, and in cooking, the meat will shrink, leaving a bare, unsightly
bone. Besides, you will have nothing to hold the skewer, if the
ligaments are cut off.] Run the skewer into the bone of the tail, and
tie firmly with a long piece of twine. Now take a longer skewer, and run
through the two wings, fastening them firmly to the sides of the bird.
With another short skewer, fasten the skin of the neck on to the
back-bone. Place the bird on its breast, and draw the strings, with
which the legs were tied, around the skewers in the wings and neck; pass
them across the back three times, and tie very tightly. By following
these directions, you will have the bird in good shape, and all the
strings on the back, so that you will avoid breaking the handsome crust
that always forms on properly basted and roasted poultry. When cooked,
first cut the strings, then draw out the skewers. The fat that comes
from the vent and the gizzard of chickens, should be tried out
immediately and put away for shortening and frying. That of geese,
turkeys and ducks is of too strong a flavor to be nice in cookery.</p>
<p>To clean the giblets: Cut the gall-bag from the lobe of the liver,
cutting a little of the liver with it, so as not to cut into the bag.
Press the heart between the finger and thumb, to extract all the blood.
With a sharp knife, cut lightly around the gizzard, and draw off the
outer coat, leaving the lining coat whole. If you cannot do that (and it
does require practice), cut in two, and after removing the filling, take
out the lining. When the poultry is to be boiled, and is stuffed, the
vent must be sewed with mending cotton or soft twine. Unless the bird is
full of dressing, this will not be necessary in roasting.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Fowl and Pork.</p>
<p>Clean and truss, pin in the floured cloth and put into water in
which one pound of rather lean pork has been boiling three hours. The
time of cooking depends upon the age of the fowl. If they are not more
than a year old an hour and a half will be enough, but if very old they
may need three hours. The quantity of pork given is for only a pair of
fowl, and more must be used if a large number of birds be cooked. Serve
with egg sauce. The liquor should be saved for soups.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Boiled Fowl with Macaroni.</p>
<p>Break twelve sticks of macaroni in pieces about two inches long;
throw them into one quart of boiling water, add a table-spoonful of salt
and half a table-spoonful of pepper. Boil rapidly for twelve minutes;
then take up, and drain off all the water. Season with one
table-spoonful of butter and one teaspoonful of salt. After the fowl
have been singed and cleaned, stuff with the macaroni. Truss them, and
then pin in a floured cloth and plunge into enough boiling water to
cover them. Boil rapidly for fifteen minutes; then set back where they
will just simmer for from one and a half to two and a half hours. The
time of cooking depends upon the age of the birds. Serve with an egg or
Bechamel sauce. The quantity of macaroni given is for two fowl. Plain
boiled macaroni should be served with this dish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Boiled Turkey with Celery.</p>
<p>Chop half a head of celery very fine. Mix with it one quart of bread
crumbs, two scant table-spoonfuls of salt, half a teaspoonful of pepper,
two heaping table-spoonfuls of butter and two eggs. Stuff the turkey
with this; sew up and truss. Wring a large square of white cotton cloth
out of cold water, and dredge it thickly with flour. Pin the turkey in
this, and plunge into boiling water. Let it boil rapidly for fifteen
minutes; then set back where it will simmer. Allow three hours for a
turkey weighing nine pounds, and twelve minutes for every additional
pound. Serve with celery sauce. The stuffing may be made the same as
above, only substitute oysters for celery, and serve with oyster sauce.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Boiled Turkey.</p>
<p>Clean and truss the same as for roasting. Rub into it two spoonfuls
of salt, and put into boiling water to cover. Simmer gently three hours,
if it weighs nine or ten pounds, and is tender. If old and tough it will
take longer. Serve with oyster, celery or egg sauce. Pour some of the
sauce over the turkey, and serve the rest in a gravy boat.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Roast Turkey.</p>
<p>Proceed the same with a turkey as with a chicken, allowing one hour
and three-quarters for a turkey weighing eight pounds, and ten minutes
for every additional pound.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Roast Turkey with Chestnut Stuffing and
Sauce.</p>
<p>Clean the turkey, and lard the breast. Throw fifty large chestnuts
into boiling water for a few minutes; then take them up, and rub off the
thin, dark skin. Cover them with boiling water, and simmer for one hour;
take them up, and mash fine. Chop one pound of veal and half a pound of
salt pork very fine. Add half of the chestnuts to this, and add, also,
half a teaspoonful of pepper, two table-spoonfuls of salt and one cupful
of stock or water. Stuff the turkey with this. Truss, and roast as
already directed. Serve with a chestnut sauce. The remaining half of the
chestnuts are for this sauce.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Boned Turkey. </span><br>
</p>
<p>Get a turkey that has not been frozen (freezing makes it tear
easily). See that every part is whole; one with a little break in the
skin will not do. Cut off the legs, in the joints, and the tips of the
wings. Do not draw the bird. Place it on its breast, and with a small,
sharp boning knife, cut in a straight line through to the bone, from the
neck down to that part of the bird where there is but little flesh,
where it is all skin and fat. Begin at the neck, and run the knife
between the flesh and the bones until you come to the wing. Then cut the
ligaments that hold the bones together and the tendons that hold the
flesh to the bones. With the thumb and fore-finger, <i>press</i> the
flesh from the smooth bone. When you come to the joint, carefully
separate the ligaments and remove the bone. Do not try to take the bone
from the next joint, as that is not in the way when carving, and it
gives a more natural shape to the bird. Now begin at the wish-bone, and
when that is free from the flesh, run the knife between the sides and
the flesh, always using the fingers to press the meat from the smooth
bones, as, for instance, the breast-bone and lower part of the sides.
Work around the legs the same as you did around the wings, always using
great care at the joints not to cut the skin. Drawing out the leg bones
turns that part of the bird inside out. Turn the bird over, and proceed
in the same manner with the other side. When all is detached, carefully
draw the skin from the breast-bone; then run the knife between the fat
and bone at the rump, leaving the small bone in the extreme end, as it
holds the skewers. Carefully remove the flesh from the skeleton, and
turn it right side out again. Rub into it two table-spoonfuls of salt
and a little pepper, and fill with dressing. Sew up the back and neck
and then the vent. Truss the same as if not boned. Take a strong piece
of cotton cloth and pin the bird firmly in it, drawing very tight at the
legs, as this is the broadest place, and the shape will not be good
unless this precaution be taken. Steam three hours, and then place on a
buttered tin sheet, which put in a baking pan. Baste well with butter,
pepper, salt and flour. Roast one hour, basting every ten minutes, and
twice with stock. When cold, remove the skewers and strings, and garnish
with aspic jelly, cooked beets and parsley. To carve: First cut off the
wings, then about two thick slices from the neck, where it will be quite
fat, and then cut in thin slices. Serve jelly with each plate.</p>
<p>Filling for a turkey weighing eight pounds: The flesh of one chicken
weighing four pounds, one pound of clear veal, half a pound of clear
salt pork, one small capful of cracker crumbs, two eggs, one cupful of
broth, two and a half table-spoonfuls of salt, half a teaspoonful of
pepper, one teaspoonful of summer savory, one of sweet majoram, one of
thyme, half a spoonful of sage, and, if you like, one table-spoonful of
capers, one quart of oysters and two table-spoonfuls of onion juice.
Have the meat uncooked and free from any tough pieces. Chop <i>very</i>
fine. Add seasoning, crackers, etc., mix thoroughly, and use. If oysters
are used, half a pound of the veal must be omitted. Where one cannot eat
veal, use chicken instead. Veal is recommended for its cheapness. Why
people choose boned turkey instead of a plain roast turkey or chicken,
is not plain, for the flavor is not so good; but at the times and places
where boned birds are used, it is a very appropriate dish. That is, at
suppers, lunches and parties, where the guests are served standing, it
is impracticable to provide anything that cannot be broken with a fork
or spoon; therefore, the advantage of a boned turkey, chicken, or bird,
is apparent. One turkey weighing eight pounds before being boned, will
serve thirty persons at a party, if there are, also, say oysters, rolls,
coffee, ices, cake and cream. If the supper is very elaborate the turkey
will answer for one of the dishes for a hundred or more persons. If
nothing more were gained in the boning of a bird, the knowledge of the
anatomy and the help this will give in carving, pay to bone two or three
chickens. It is advisable to bone at least two fowls before trying a
turkey, for if you spoil them there is nothing lost, as they make a stew
or soup.</p>
<p>Aspic jelly: One and a half pints of clear stock--beef if for amber
jelly, and chicken or veal if for white; half a box of gelatine, the
white of one egg, half a cupful of cold water, two cloves, one large
slice of onion, twelve pepper-corns, one stalk of celery, salt. Soak
gelatine two hours in the cold water. Then put on with other
ingredients, the white of the egg being beaten with one spoonful of the
cold stock. Let come to a boil, and set back where it will just simmer
for twenty minutes. Strain through a napkin, turn into a mould or
shallow dish, and put away to harden. The jelly can be made with the
bones of the turkey and chicken, by washing them, covering with cold
water and boiling down to about three pints; by then straining and
setting away to cool, and in the morning skimming off all the fat and
turning off the clear stock. The bones may, instead, be used for a soup.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Roast Goose.</p>
<p>Stuff the goose with a potato dressing made in the following manner:
Six potatoes, boiled, pared and mashed fine and light; one
table-spoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of pepper, one spoonful of sage,
two table-spoonfuls of onion juice, two of butter. Truss, and dredge
well with salt, pepper and flour. Roast before the fire (if weighing
eight pounds) one hour and a half; in the oven, one hour and a quarter.
Make gravy the same as for turkey. No butter is required for goose, it
is so fat. Serve with apple sauce. Many people boil the goose half an
hour before roasting, to take away the strong flavor. Why not have
something else if you do not like the real flavor of the goose?</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Roast Duck.</p>
<p>Ducks, to be good, must be cooked rare: for this reason it is best
not to stuff. If, however, you do stuff them, use the goose dressing,
and have it very hot. The better way is to cut an onion in two, and put
into the body of the bird; then truss, and dredge with salt, pepper and
flour, and roast, if before the fire, forty minutes, and if in the oven,
thirty minutes. The fire must be very hot if the duck be roasted in the
kitchen, and if in the oven, this must be a quick one. Serve with
currant jelly and a sauce made the same as for turkey.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Roast Chicken.</p>
<p>Clean the chicken, and stuff the breast and part of the body with
dressing made as follows: For a pair of chickens weighing between seven
and eight pounds, take one quart of stale bread (being sure not to have
any hard pieces), and break up in very fine crumbs. Add a table-spoonful
of salt, a scant teaspoonful of pepper, a teaspoonful of chopped
parsley, half a teaspoonful of powdered sage, one of summer savory and a
scant half cupful of butter. Mix well together. This gives a rich
dressing that will separate like rice when served. Now truss the
chickens, and dredge well with salt. Take soft butter in the hand, and
rub thickly over the chicken; then dredge rather thickly with flour.
Place on the side, on the meat rack, and put into a hot oven for a few
moments, that the flour in the bottom of the pan may brown. When it is
browned, put in water enough to cover the pan. Baste every fifteen
minutes with the gravy in the pan, and dredge with salt, pepper and
flour. When one side is browned, turn, and brown the other. The last
position in which the chicken should bake is on its back, that the
breast may be nicely frothed and browned. The last basting is on the
breast, and should be done with soft butter, and the breast should be
dredged with flour. Putting the butter on the chicken at first, and then
covering with flour, makes a paste, which keeps the juices in the
chicken, and also supplies a certain amount of rich basting that is
absorbed into the meat. It really does not take as much butter to baste
poultry or game in this manner as by the old method of putting it on
with a spoon after the bird began to cook. The water in the pan must
often be renewed; and always be careful not to get in too much at a
time. It will take an hour and a quarter to cook a pair of chickens,
each weighing between three and a half and four pounds; anything larger,
an hour and a half. A sure sign that they are done is the readiness of
joints to separate from the body. If the chickens are roasted in the
tin-kitchen, before the fire, it will take a quarter of an hour longer
than in the oven.</p>
<p>Gravy for chickens: Wash the hearts, livers, gizzards and necks and
put on to boil in three pints of water; boil down to one pint. Take them
all up. Put the liver on a plate, and mash fine with the back of the
spoon; return it to the water in which it was boiled. Mix two
table-spoonfuls of flour with half a cupful of cold water. Stir into the
gravy, season well with salt and pepper, and set back where it will
simmer, for twenty minutes. Take up the chickens, and take the meat rack
out of the pan. Then tip the pan to one side, to bring all the gravy
together. Skim off the fat. Place the pan on top of the stove and turn
into it one cupful of water. Let this boil up, in the meantime scraping
everything from the sides and bottom of the pan. Turn this into the made
gravy, and let it all boil together while you are removing the skewers
and strings from the chickens.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chicken &agrave; la Matelote.</p>
<p>Cut up an uncooked chicken. Rub in butter and flour, and brown in an
oven. Fry in four table-spoonfuls of chicken fat or butter, for about
twenty minutes, a small carrot, onion and parsnip, all cut into dice.
When the chicken is browned, put it in a stew-pan with the cooked
vegetables and one quart of white stock. Then into the fat in which the
vegetables were fried, put two table-spoonfuls of flour, and cook until
brown. Stir this in with the chicken. Add the liver, mashed fine, one
table-spoonful of capers and salt and pepper to taste. Cook very gently
three-quarters of an hour; then add one-fourth of a pound of mushrooms,
cut in small pieces. Cook fifteen minutes longer. Serve with a border of
boiled macaroni, mashed potatoes or rice.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chicken &agrave; la Reine.</p>
<p>Clean, stuff and truss a pair of chickens, as for roasting. Dredge
well with salt, pepper and flour. Cut a quarter of a pound of pork in
slices, and put part on the bottom of a deep stew-pan with two slices of
carrot and one large onion, cut fine. Stir over the fire until they
begin to color; then put in the chickens, and lay the remainder of the
pork over them. Place the stew-pan in a hot oven for twenty minutes;
then add white stock to half cover the chicken (about two quarts), and a
bouquet of sweet herbs. Dredge well with flour. Cover the pan and return
to the oven. Baste about every fifteen minutes, and after cooking one
hour, turn over the chickens. Cook, in all, two hours. Serve with
Hollandaise sauce or with the sauce in which the chickens were cooked,
it being strained over them.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chicken &agrave; la Tartare.</p>
<p>Singe the chicken, and split down the back. Wipe thoroughly with a
damp cloth. Dredge well with salt and pepper, cover thickly with
softened butter, and dredge thickly on both sides with fine, dry bread
crumbs. Place in a baking pan, the inside down, and cook in a very hot
oven thirty minutes, taking care not to bum. Serve with Tartare sauce.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Broiled Chicken.</p>
<p>Singe the chicken, and split down the back, if not already prepared;
and wipe with a damp cloth. Never wash it. Season well with salt and
pepper. Take some soft butter in the right hand and rub over the bird,
letting the greater part go on the breast and legs. Dredge with flour.
Put in the double broiler, and broil over a moderate fire, having the
breast turned to the heat at first. When the chicken is a nice brown,
which will be in about fifteen minutes, place in a pan and put into a
moderate oven for twelve minutes. Place on a hot dish, season, with
salt, pepper and butter, and serve immediately. This rule is for a
chicken weighing about two and a half pounds. The chicken is improved by
serving with <i>ma&icirc;tre d' h&ocirc;tel</i> butter or Tartare sauce.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chicken Stew with Dumplings.</p>
<p>One chicken or fowl, weighing about three pounds; one table-spoonful
of butter, three of flour, one large onion, three slices of carrot,
three of turnip, three pints of boiling water and salt and pepper. Cut
the chicken in slices suitable for serving. Wash, and put in a deep
stew-pan, add the water, and set on to boil. Put the carrot, turnip and
onion, cut fine, in a sauce-pan, with the butter, and cook slowly half
an hour, stirring often; then take up the vegetables in a strainer,
place the strainer in the stew-pan with the chicken, and dip some of the
water into it. Mash the vegetables with the back of a spoon, and rub as
much as possible through the strainer. Now skim two spoonfuls of chicken
fat from the water, and put in the pan in which the vegetables were
cooked. When boiling hot, add the three table-spoonfuls of flour. Stir
over the fire until a dark brown; then stir it in with the chicken, and
simmer until tender. Season well with pepper and salt. The stew should
only simmer all the while it is cooking. It must not boil hard. About
two hours will be needed to cook a year old chicken. Twelve minutes
before serving draw the stew-pan forward, and boil up; then put in the
dumplings, and cook <i>ten</i> minutes. Take them up, and keep in the
heater while you are dishing the chicken into the centre of the platter.
Afterwards, place the dumplings around the edge. This is a very nice and
economical dish, if pains are taken in preparing. One stewed chicken
will go farther than two roasted.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Larded Grouse.</p>
<p>Clean and wash the grouse. Lard the breast and legs. Run a small
skewer into the legs and through the tail. Tie firmly with twine. Dredge
with salt, and rub the breast with soft butter; then dredge thickly with
flour. Put into a quick oven. If to be very rare, cook twenty minutes;
if wished better done, thirty minutes. The former time, as a general
thing, suits gentlemen better, but thirty minutes is preferred by
ladies. If the birds are cooked in a tin-kitchen, it should be for
thirty or thirty-five minutes. When done, place on a hot dish, on which
has been spread bread sauce. Sprinkle fried crumbs over both grouse and
sauce. Garnish with parsley. The grouse may, instead, be served on a hot
dish, with the parsley garnish, and the sauce and crumbs served in
separate dishes. The first method is the better, however, as you get in
the sauce all the gravy that comes from the birds.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Larded Partridges.</p>
<p>Partridges are cooked and served the same as grouse.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Larded Quail.</p>
<p>The directions for cooking and serving are the same as those for
grouse, only that quails cook in fifteen minutes. All dry-meated birds
are cooked in this way. The question is sometimes asked, Should ducks be
larded? Larding is to give richness to a dry meat that does not have fat
enough of its own; therefore, meats like goose, duck and mutton are <i>not</i>
improved by larding.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Broiled Quail.</p>
<p>Split the quail down the back. Wipe with a damp towel. Season with
salt and pepper, rub thickly with soft butter, and dredge with flour.
Broil ten minutes over clear coals. Serve on hot buttered toast,
garnishing with parsley.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Broiled Pigeons.</p>
<p>Prepare, cook and serve the same as quail They should be young for
broiling, squabs being the best.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Broiled Small Birds.</p>
<p>All small birds can be broiled according to the directions for
quail, remembering that for extremely small ones it takes a very bright
fire. As the birds should be only browned, the time required is very
brief.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Small Birds, Roasted.</p>
<p>Clean, by washing quickly in one water after they have been drawn.
Season with salt and pepper. Cut slices of salt pork <i>very thin</i>,
and with small skewers, fasten a slice around each bird. Run a long
skewer through the necks of six or eight, and rest it on a shallow
baking-pan. When all the birds are arranged, put into a <i>hot</i> oven
for twelve minutes, or before a hot fire for a quarter of an hour. Serve
on toast.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Potted Pigeons.</p>
<p>Clean and wash one dozen pigeons. Stand them on their necks in a
deep earthen or porcelain pot, and turn on them a pint of vinegar. Cut
three large onions in twelve pieces, and place a piece on each pigeon.
Cover the pot, and let it stand all night In the morning take out the
pigeons, and throw away the onions and vinegar. Fry, in a deep stew-pan,
six slices of fat pork, and when browned, take them up, and in the fat
put six onions, sliced fine. On these put the pigeons, having first
trussed them, and dredge well with salt pepper and flour. Cover, and
cook slowly for forty-five minutes, stirring occasionally; then add two
quarts of boiling water, and simmer gently two hours. Mix four heaping
table-spoonfuls of flour with a cupful of cold water, and stir in with
the pigeons. Taste to see if there is enough seasoning, and if there is
not, add more. Cook half an hour longer. Serve with a garnish of rice or
riced potatoes. More or less onion can be used; and, if you like it so,
spice the gravy slightly.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Pigeons in Jelly.</p>
<p>Wash and truss one dozen pigeons. Put them in a kettle with four
pounds of the shank of veal, six cloves, twenty-five pepper-corns, an
onion that has been fried in one spoonful of butter, one stalk of
celery, a bouquet of sweet herbs and four and a half quarts of water.
Have the veal shank broken in small pieces. As soon as the contents of
the kettle come to a boil, skim carefully, and set for three hours where
they will just simmer. After they have been cooking one hour, add two
table-spoonfuls of salt. When the pigeons are done, take them up, being
careful not to break them, and remove the strings. Draw the kettle
forward, where it will boil rapidly, and keep there for forty minutes;
then strain the liquor through a napkin, and taste to see if seasoned
enough. The water should have boiled down to two and a half quarts. Have
two moulds that will each hold six pigeons. Put a thin layer of the
jelly in these, and set on ice to harden. When hard, arrange the pigeons
in them, and cover with the jelly, which must be cold, but liquid. Place
in the ice chest for six or, better still, twelve hours. There should be
only one layer of the pigeons in the mould.</p>
<p>To serve: Dip the mould in a basin of warm water for one minute, and
turn on a cold dish. Garnish with pickled beets and parsley. A Tartare
sauce can be served with this dish.</p>
<p>If squabs are used, two hours will cook them. All small birds, as
well as partridge, grouse, etc., can be prepared in the same manner.
Remember that the birds must be cooked tender, and that the liquor must
be so reduced that it will become jellied.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Roast Rabbit.</p>
<p>First make a stuffing of a pound of veal and a quarter of a pound of
pork, simmered two hours in water to cover; four crackers, rolled fine;
a table-spoonful of salt, a scant teaspoonful of pepper, a teaspoonful
of summer savory, a large table-spoonful of butter and one and a quarter
cupfuls of the broth in which the veal and pork were cooked. Chop the
meat fine, add the other ingredients, and put on the fire to heat. Cut
off the rabbit's head, open the vent, and draw. Wash clean, and season
with salt and pepper. Stuff while the dressing is hot, and sew up the
opening. Put the rabbit on its knees, and skewer in that position. Rub
thickly with butter, dredge with flour, and put in the baking pan, the
bottom of which should be covered with hot water. Bake half an hour in a
quick oven, basting frequently. Serve with a border of mashed potatoes,
and pour the gravy over the rabbit.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Curry of Rabbit.</p>
<p>Cut the rabbit in small pieces. Wash, and cook the same as chicken
curry.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Saddle of Venison.</p>
<p>Carefully scrape off the hair, and wipe with a damp towel; Season
well with salt and pepper, and roll up and skewer together. Rub thickly
with soft butter and dredge thickly with flour. Roast for an hour before
a clear fire or in a <i>hot</i> oven, basting frequently. When half
done, if you choose, baste with a few spoonfuls of claret. Or, you can
have one row of larding on each side of the back-bone. This gives a
particularly nice flavor.</p>
<p>To make the gravy: Pour off all the fat from the baking pan, and put
in the pan a cupful of boiling water. Stir from the sides and bottom,
and set back where it will keep hot. In a small frying-pan put one
table-spoonful of butter, a small slice of onion, six pepper-corns and
four whole cloves. Cook until the onion is browned, and then add a
generous teaspoonful of flour. Stir until this is browned; then,
gradually, add the gravy in the pan. Boil one minute. Strain, and add
half a teaspoonful of lemon juice and three table-spoonfuls of currant
jelly. Serve both venison and gravy very hot. The time given is for a
saddle weighing between ten and twelve pounds. All the dishes and plates
for serving must be hot. Venison is cooked in almost the same manner as
beef, always remembering that it must be served <i>rare</i> and <i>hot</i>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Roast Leg of Venison.</p>
<p>Draw the dry skin from the meat, and wipe with a damp towel. Make a
paste with one quart of flour and a generous pint of cold water. Cover
the venison with this, and place before a hot fire, if to be roasted in
the tin kitchen, or else in a very hot oven. As the paste browns, baste
it frequently with the gravy in the pan. When it has been cooking one
hour and a half, take off the paste, cover with butter, and dredge
thickly with flour. Cook one hour longer, basting frequently with
butter, salt and flour. Make the gravy the same as for a saddle of
venison, or serve with game sauce. The time given is for a leg weighing
about fifteen pounds.<br>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><big><a name="ENTREES"></a> ENTREES.</big></big></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Fillet of Beef, Larded.</p>
<p>The true fillet is the tenderloin, although sometimes one will see a
rib roast, boned and rolled, called a fillet. A short fillet, weighing
from two and a half to three pounds (the average weight from a very
large rump), will suffice for ten persons at a dinner where this is
served as one course; and if a larger quantity is wanted a great saving
will still be made if two short fillets are used. They cost about two
dollars, while a large one, weighing the same amount, would cost five
dollars, Fillet of beef is one of the simplest, safest and most
satisfactory dishes that a lady can prepare for either her own family or
guests. After a single trial she will think no more of it than of
broiling a beef steak. First, remove from the fillet, with a sharp
knife, every shred of muscle, ligament and thin, tough skin. If it is
not then of a good round shape, skewer it into shape. Draw a line
through the centre, and lard with two rows of pork, having them meet at
this line. Dredge well with salt, pepper and flour, and put, without
water, in a very small pan. Place in a hot oven for thirty minutes. Let
it be in the lower part of the oven the first ten minutes, then place on
the upper grate. Serve with mushroom, Hollandaise or tomato sauce, or
with potato balls. If with sauce, this should be poured around the
fillet, the time given cooks a fillet of any size, the shape being such
that it will take half an hour for either two or six pounds. Save the
fat trimmed from the fillet for frying, and the lean part for soup stock.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Fillet of Beef &agrave; la Hollandaise.</p>
<p>Trim and cut the short fillet into slices about half an inch thick.
Season these well with salt, and then lay in a pan with six
table-spoonfuls of butter, just warm enough to be oily. Squeeze the
juice of a quarter of a lemon over them. Let them stand one hour; then
dip lightly in flour, place in the double broiler, and cook for six
minutes over a very bright fire. Have a mound of mashed potatoes in the
centre of a hot dish, and rest the slices against this. Pour a
Hollandaise sauce around. Garnish with parsley.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Fillet of Beef &agrave; l'Allemand.</p>
<p>Trim the fillet and skewer it into a good shape. Season well with
pepper and salt. Have one egg and half a teaspoonful of sugar well
beaten together; roll the fillet in this and then in bread crumbs. Bake
in the oven for thirty minutes. Serve with Allemand sauce poured around
it.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Fillet of Beef in Jelly.</p>
<p>Trim a short fillet, and cut a deep incision in the side, being
careful not to go through to the other side or the ends. Fill this with
one cupful of veal, prepared as for quenelles, and the whites of three
hard-boiled eggs, cut into rings. Sew up the openings, and bind the
fillet into good shape with broad bands of cotton cloth. Put in a deep
stew-pan two slices of ham and two of pork, and place the fillet on
them; then put in two calf's feet, two stalks of celery and two quarts
of clear stock. Simmer gently two hours and a half. Take up the fillet,
and set away to cool. Strain the stock, and set away to harden. When
hard, scrape of every particle of fat, and put on the fire in a clean
sauce-pan, with half a slice of onion and the whites of two eggs, beaten
with four table-spoonfuls of cold water. When this boils, season well
with salt, and set back where it will just simmer for half an hour; then
strain through a napkin. Pour a little of the jelly into a two-quart
charlotte russe mould (half an inch deep), and set on the ice to harden.
As soon as it is hard, decorate with the egg rings. Add about three
spoonfuls of the liquid jelly, to set the eggs. When hard, add enough
jelly to cover the eggs, and when this is also hard, trim the ends of
the fillet, and draw out the thread. Place in the centre of the mould,
and cover with the remainder of the jelly. If the fillet floats, place a
slight weight on it. Set in the ice chest to harden. When ready to
serve, place the mould in a pan of warm water for half a minute, and
then turn out the fillet gently upon a dish. Garnish with a circle of
egg rings, each of which has a stoned olive in the centre. Put here and
there a sprig of parsley.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Alamode Beef.</p>
<p>Six pounds of the upper part, or of the vein, of the round of beef,
half a pound of fat salt pork, three table-spoonfuls of butter, two
onions, half a carrot, half a turnip, two table-spoonfuls of vinegar,
one of lemon juice, one heaping table-spoonful of salt, half a
teaspoonful of pepper, two cloves, six allspice, a small piece of stick
cinnamon, a bouquet of sweet herbs, two scant quarts of boiling water
and four table-spoonfuls of flour. Cut the pork in thick strips--as long
as the meat is thick, and, with a large larding needle (which comes for
this purpose), draw these through the meat. If you do not have the large
needle, make the holes with the boning knife or the carving steel, and
press the pork through with the fingers. Put the butter in a six-quart
stew-pan, and when it melts, add the vegetables, cut fine. Let them cook
five minutes, stirring all the while. Put in the meat, which has been
well dredged with the flour; brown on one aide, and then turn, and
brown the other. Add one quart of the water; stir well, and then add the
other, with the spice, herbs, vinegar, salt and pepper. Cover tightly,
and <i>simmer gently</i> four hours. Add the lemon juice. Taste the
gravy, and, if necessary, add more salt and pepper. Let it cook twenty
minutes longer. Take up the meat, and draw the stew-pan forward, where
it will boil rapidly, for ten or fifteen minutes, having first skimmed
off all the fat. Strain the gravy on the beef, and serve. This dish may
be garnished with, potato balls or button onions.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Macaronied Beef.</p>
<p>Six pounds of beef from the upper part of the round or the vein, a
quarter of a pound of macaroni (twelve sticks), half a cupful of butter,
four large onions, one quart of peeled and sliced tomatoes, or a quart
can of the vegetable; two heaping table-spoonfuls of flour, salt, pepper
and two cloves. Make holes in the beef with the large larding needle or
the steel, and press the macaroni into them. Season with salt and
pepper. Put the butter and the onions, which have been peeled and cut
fine, in a six-quart stew-pan, and stir over the fire until a golden
brown; then put in the meat, first drawing the onions aside. Dredge with
the flour, and spread the top of the meat with the fried onions. Put in
the spice and one quart of boiling water. Cover tightly, and simmer <i>slowly</i>
for three hours; then add the tomato, and cook one hour longer. Take up
the meat, and strain the gravy over it. Serve hot. The tomato may be
omitted if one pint more of water and an extra table-spoonful of flour
are used instead. Always serve macaroni with this dish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Cannelon of Beef.</p>
<p>One thin slice of the upper part of the round of beef. Cut off all
the fat, and so trim as to give the piece a regular shape. Put the
trimmings in the chopping tray, with a quarter of a pound of boiled salt
pork and one pound of lean cooked ham. Chop very fine; then add a speck
of cayenne, one teaspoonful of mixed mustard, one of onion juice, one
table-spoonful of lemon juice and three eggs. Season the beef with salt
and pepper. Spread the mixture over it, and roll up. Tie with twine,
being careful not to draw too tightly. Have six slices of fat pork fried
in the braising pan. Cut two onions, two slices of carrot, and two of
turnip into this, and stir for two minutes over the fire. Roll the
cannelon in a plate of flour, and put it in the braising pan with the
pork and vegetables. Brown slightly on all sides; then add one quart of
boiling water, and place in the oven. Cook three hours, basting every
fifteen minutes. When it has been cooking two hours, add half a cupful
of canned tomatoes or two fresh ones. Taste to see if the gravy is
seasoned enough; if it is not, add seasoning. The constant dredging with
flour will thicken the gravy sufficiently. Slide the cake turner under
the beef, and lift carefully on to a hot dish. Cut the string in three
or four places with a <i>sharp</i> knife, and gently draw it away from
the meat. Skim off all the fat. Strain the gravy through a fine sieve on
to the meat. Garnish with a border of toast or riced potatoes. Cut in
thin slices with a sharp knife.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Cannelon of Beef, No. 2.</p>
<p>Two pounds of the round of beef, the rind of half a lemon, three
sprigs of parsley, one teaspoonful of salt, barely one-fourth of a
teaspoonful of pepper, a quarter of a nutmeg, two table-spoonfuls of
melted butter, one raw egg and half a teaspoonful of onion juice. Chop
meat, parsley and lemon rind very fine. Add other ingredients, and mix
thoroughly. Shape, into a roll, about three inches in diameter and six
in length. Roll in buttered paper, and bake thirty minutes, basting with
butter and water. When cooked, place on a hot dish, gently unroll from
the paper, and serve with Flemish sauce poured over it. You may serve
tomato or mushroom sauce if you prefer either.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Beef Roulette.</p>
<p>Have two pounds of the upper part of the round, cut very thin. Mix
together one cupful of finely-chopped ham, two eggs, one teaspoonful of
mixed mustard, a speck of cayenne and three table-spoonfuls of stock or
water. Spread upon the beef, which roll up firmly and tie with soft
twine, being careful not to draw too tightly, for that would cut the
meat as soon as it began to cook. Cover the roll with flour, and fry
brown in four table-spoonfuls of ham or pork fat. Put it in as small a
sauce-pan as will hold it. Into the fat remaining in the pan put two
finely-chopped onions, and cook until a pale yellow; then add two
table-spoonfuls of flour, and stir three minutes longer. Pour upon this
one pint and a half of boiling water. Boil up once, and pour over the
roulette; then add two cloves, one-fourth of a teaspoonful of pepper and
one heaping teaspoonful of salt. Cover the sauce-pan, and set where it
will simmer slowly for three hours. After the first hour and a half,
turn the roulette over. Serve hot; with the gravy strained over it. It
is also nice to serve cold for lunch or supper. Ham force-meat balls and
parsley make a pretty garnish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Beef Olives.</p>
<p>One and a half pounds of beef, cut very thin. Trim off the edges and
fat; then cut in strips three inches wide and four long; season well
with salt and pepper. Chop fine the trimmings and the fat Add three
table-spoonfuls of powdered cracker, one teaspoonful of sage and savory,
mixed, one-fourth of a teaspoonful of pepper and two teaspoonfuls of
salt. Mix very thoroughly and spread on the strips of beef. Roll them
up, and tie with twine. When all are done, roll in flour. Fry brown a
quarter of a pound of pork. Take it out of the pan, and put the olives
in. Fry brown, and put in a small sauce-pan that can be tightly covered.
In the fat remaining in the pan put one table-spoonful of flour, and
stir until perfectly smooth and brown; then pour in, gradually, nearly a
pint and a half of boiling water. Stir for two or three minutes, season
to taste with salt and pepper, and pour over the olives. Cover the
sauce-pan, and let simmer two hours. Take up at the end of this time and
cut the strings with a sharp knife. Place the olives in a row on a dish,
and pour the gravy over them.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Veal Olives.</p>
<p>These are made in the same manner, except that a dressing, like
chicken dressing, is made for them. For one and a half pounds of veal
take three crackers, half a table-spoonful of butter, half a teaspoonful
of savory, one-fourth of a teaspoonful of sage, a teaspoonful of salt, a
very little pepper and an eighth of a cupful of water. Spread the strips
with this, and proceed as for beef olives.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Fricandelles of Veal.</p>
<p>Two pounds of clear veal, half a cupful of finely-chopped cooked
ham, one cupful of milk, one cupful of bread crumbs, the juice of half a
lemon, one table-spoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of pepper, one
cupful of butter, a pint and a half of stock, three table-spoonfuls of
flour. Chop the veal fine. Cook the bread crumbs and milk until a smooth
paste, being careful not to burn. Add to the chopped veal and ham, and
when well mixed, add the seasoning and four table-spoonfuls of the
butter. Mix thoroughly, and form into balls about the size of an egg.
Have the yolks of three eggs well beaten, and use to cover the balls.
Fry these, till a light brown, in the remainder of the butter, being <i>very</i>
careful not to burn. Stir the three table-spoonfuls of flour into the
butter that remains after the balls are fried. Stir until dark brown,
and then gradually stir the stock into it. Boil for two minutes. Taste
to see if seasoned enough; then add the balls, and cook <i>very slowly</i>
for one hour. Serve with a garnish of toast and lemon.</p>
<p>Fricandelles can be made with chicken, mutton, lamb and beef, the
only change in the above directions being to omit the ham.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Braised Tongue.</p>
<p>Wash a fresh beef tongue, and, with a trussing needle, run a strong
twine through the roots and end of it, drawing tightly enough to have
the end meet the roots; then tie firmly. Cover with boiling water, and
boil gently for two hours; then take up and drain. Put six
table-spoonfuls of butter in the braising pan, and when hot, put in half
a small carrot, half a small turnip and two onions, all cut fine. Cook
five minutes, stirring all the time, and then draw to one side. Roll the
tongue in flour, and put in the pan. As soon as browned on one side,
turn, and brown the other. Add one quart of the water in which it was
boiled, a bouquet of sweet herbs, one clove, a small piece of cinnamon
and salt and pepper. Cover, and cook two hours in a slow oven, basting
often with the gravy in the pan, and salt, pepper and flour. When it
has been cooking an hour and a half, add the juice of half a lemon to
the gravy. When done, take up. Melt two table-spoonfuls of glaze, and
pour over the tongue. Place in the heater until the gravy is made. Mix
one table-spoonful of corn-starch with a little cold water, and stir
into the boiling gravy, of which there should be one pint. Boil one
minute; then strain, and pour around the tongue. Garnish with parsley,
and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Fillets of Tongue.</p>
<p>Cut cold boiled tongue in pieces about four inches long, two wide
and half an inch thick. Dip in melted butter and in flour. For eight
fillets put two table-spoonfuls of butter in the frying-pan, and when
hot, put in the tongue. Brown on both sides, being careful not to burn.
Take up, and put one more spoonful of butter in the pan, and then one
heaping teaspoonful of flour. Stir until dark brown; then add one cupful
of stock, half a teaspoonful of parsley and one table-spoonful of lemon
juice, or one tea-spoonful of vinegar. Let this boil up once, and then
pour it around the tongue, which has been dished on thin strips of
toast. Garnish with parsley, and serve. For a change, a table-spoonful
of chopped pickles, or of capers, can be stirred into the sauce the last
moment.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Escaloped Tongue.</p>
<p>Chop some cold tongue--not too fine, and have for each pint one
table-spoonful of onion juice, one teaspoonful of chopped parsley, one
heaping teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of capers, one cupful of
bread crumbs, half a cupful of stock and three table-spoonfuls of
butter. Butter the escalop dish, and cover the bottom with bread crumbs.
Put in the tongue, which has been mixed with the parsley, salt, pepper
and capers, and add the stock, in which has been mixed the onion juice.
Put part of the butter on the dish with the remainder of the bread
crumbs, and then bits of butter here and there. Bake twenty minutes, and
serve hot.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Tongue in Jelly.</p>
<p>Boil and skin either a fresh or salt tongue. When cold, trim off the
roots. Have one and a fourth quarts of aspic jelly in the liquid state.
Cover the bottom of a two-quart mould about an inch deep with it, and
let it harden. With a fancy vegetable cutter, cut out leaves from cooked
beets, and garnish the bottom of the mould with them. Gently pour in
three table-spoonfuls of jelly, to set the vegetables. When this is
hard, add jelly enough to cover the vegetables, and let the whole get
very hard. Then put in the tongue, and about half a cupful of jelly,
which should be allowed to harden, and so keep the meat in place when
the remainder is added. Pour in the remainder of the jelly and set away
to harden. To serve: Dip the mould for a few moments in a pan of warm
water, and then gently turn on to a dish. Garnish with pickles and
parsley. Pickled beet is especially nice.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Lambs' Tongues in Jelly.</p>
<p>Lambs' tongues are prepared the same as beef tongues. Three of four
moulds, each holding a little less than a pint, will make enough for a
small company, one tongue being put in each mould. The tongues can all
be put on the same dish, or on two, if the table is long.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Lambs' Tongues, Stewed.</p>
<p>Six tongues, three heaping table-spoonfuls of butter, one large
onion, two slices of carrot, three slices of white turnip, three
table-spoonfuls of flour, one of salt, a little pepper, one quart of
stock or water and a bouquet of sweet herbs. Boil the tongues one hour
and a half in clear water; then take up, cover with cold water, and draw
off the skins. Put the butter, onion, turnip and carrot in the stew-pan,
and cook slowly for fifteen minutes; then add the flour, and cook until
brown, stirring all the while. Stir the stock into this, and when it
boils up, add the tongue, salt, pepper and herbs. Simmer gently for two
hours. Cut the carrots, turnips and potatoes into cubes. Boil the
potatoes in salted water ten minutes, and the carrots and turnips one
hour. Place the tongues in the centre of a hot dish. Arrange the
vegetables around them, strain the gravy, and pour over all. Garnish
with parsley, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Stewed Ox Tails.</p>
<p>Two ox tails, three table-spoonfuls of butter, two of flour, one
large onion, half a small carrot, three slices of turnip, two stalks of
celery, two cloves, a pint and a half of stock or water, salt and pepper
to taste. Divide the tails in pieces about four inches long. Cut the
vegetables in small pieces. Let the butter get hot in the stew-pan; then
add the vegetables, and when they begin to brown, add the flour. Stir
for two minutes. Put in the tails, and add the seasoning and stock.
Simmer gently three hours. Serve on a hot dish with gravy strained over
them.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Ox Tails &agrave; la Tartare.</p>
<p>Three ox tails, two eggs, one cupful of bread crumbs, salt, pepper,
one quart of stock, a bouquet of sweet herbs. Cut the tails in four-inch
pieces, and put them on to boil with the stock and sweet herbs. Let them
simmer two hours. Take up, drain and cool. When cold, dip them in the
beaten eggs and in bread crumbs. Fry in boiling fat till a golden brown.
Have Tartare sauce spread on the centre of a cold dish, and arrange the
ox tails on this. Garnish with parsley, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Haricot of Ox Tails.</p>
<p>Three ox tails, two carrots, two onions, two small white turnips,
three potatoes, three table-spoonfuls of butter, two of flour, three
pints of water and salt and pepper to taste. Cut the tails in pieces
about four inches long. Cut the onions very fine, and the carrots,
turnips and potatoes into large cubes. Put the butter, meat and onion in
the stew-pan and fry, stirring all the time, until the onions are a
golden brown; then add the flour, and stir two minutes longer. Add the
water, and when it comes to a boil, skim carefully. Set back where it
will simmer. When it has been cooking one hour, add the carrots and
turnips. Cook another hour, and then add the salt, pepper and potatoes.
Simmer twenty minutes longer. Heap the vegetables in the centre of a hot
dish, and arrange the tails around them. Pour the gravy over all, and
serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Ragout of Mutton.</p>
<p>Three pounds of any of the cheap parts of mutton, six
table-spoonfuls of butter, three of flour, twelve button onions, or one
of the common size; one large white turnip, cut into little cubes; salt,
pepper, one quart of water and a bouquet of sweet herbs. Cut the meat in
small pieces. Put three table-spoonfuls each of butter and flour in the
stew-pan, and when hot and smooth, add the meat. Stir until a rich
brown, and then add water, and set where it will simmer. Put three
table-spoonfuls of butter in a frying-pan, and when hot, put in the
turnips and onions with a teaspoonful of flour. Stir all the time until
a golden brown; then drain, and put with the meat. Simmer for an hour
and a half. Garnish with rice, toasted bread, plain boiled macaroni or
mashed potatoes. Small cubes of potato can be added half an hour before
dishing. Serve very hot.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Ragout of Veal.</p>
<p>Prepare the same as mutton, using one table-spoonful more of butter,
and cooking an hour longer.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chicken Pie.</p>
<p>One fowl weighing between four and five pounds, half the rule for
chopped paste (see chopped paste), three pints of water, one-fourth of a
teaspoonful of pepper, one table-spoonful of salt (these last two
quantities may be increased if you like), three table-spoonfuls of
flour, three of butter, two eggs, one table-spoonful of onion juice and
a bouquet of sweet herbs. Clean the fowl, and cut in pieces as for
serving. Put it in a stew-pan with the hot water, salt, pepper and
herbs. When it comes to a boil, skim, and set back where it will simmer
one hour and a half. Take up the chicken, and place in a deep earthen
pie dish. Draw the stew-pan forward where it will boil rapidly for
fifteen minutes. Skim off the fat and take out the bouquet. Put the
butter in a frying-pan, and when hot, add the flour. Stir until smooth,
but not brown, and stir in the water in which the chicken was boiled.
Cook ten minutes. Beat the eggs with one spoonful of cold water, and
gradually add the gravy to them. Turn this into the pie dish. Lift the
chicken with a spoon, that the gravy may fall to the bottom. Set away to
cool. When cold, roll out a covering of paste a little larger than the
top of the dish and about one-fourth of an inch thick. Cover the pie
with this, having the edges turned into the dish. Roll the remainder of
the paste the same as before, and with a thimble, or something as small,
cut out little pieces all over the cover. Put this perforated paste over
the first cover, turning out the edges and rolling slightly. Bake one
hour in a moderate oven.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Pasties of Game and Poultry.</p>
<p>Make three pints of force-meat. (See force-meat for game.) Cut all
the solid meat from four grouse. Lard each piece with very fine strips
of pork. Put half a cupful of butter and a finely-cut onion in a
frying-pan. Stir until the onion is yellow; then put in the grouse, and
cook slowly, with the cover on, for forty minutes. Stir occasionally.
Take up the grouse, and put three table-spoonfuls of flour with the
butter remaining in the pan. Stir until brown; add one quart of stock,
two table-spoonfuls of glaze, a bouquet of sweet herbs, and four cloves.
Simmer twenty minutes, and strain. Butter a four-quart earthen dish, and
cover the bottom and sides with the force-meat. Put in a layer of the
grouse, and moisten well with the gravy, which must be highly seasoned
with salt and pepper; then put in the yolks of six hard-boiled eggs,
and the whites, cut into rings. Moisten with gravy, and add another
layer of grouse, and of eggs and gravy. Twelve eggs should be used.
Make a paste as for chicken pie. Cover with this, and bake one hour and
a half. Serve either hot or cold.</p>
<p>Any kind of meat pasties can be made in the same manner. With a veal
pastie put in a few slices of cooked ham.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Cold Game Pie.</p>
<p>Make three pints of force-meat. (See force-meat for game.) Cut all
the meat from two partridges or grouse, and put the bones on to boil
with three quarts of water and three pounds of a shank of veal. Fry four
large slices of fat salt pork, and as soon as brown, take up, and into
the fat put one onion, cut in slices. When this begins to turn yellow,
take up, and put the meat of the birds in the pan. Dredge well with
salt, pepper and flour, and stir constantly for four minutes; then take
up, and put away to cool. Make a crust as directed for raised pies.
Butter the French pie mould very thoroughly, and line with paste. Spread
upon the paste--both upon the sides and bottom of the mould--a thin
layer of fat salt pork, then a layer of force-meat, one of grouse, again
one of force-meat, and so on until the pie is filled. Leave a space of
about half an inch at the edge of the mould, and heap the filling in the
centre. Moisten with half a cupful of well-seasoned stock. Roll the
remainder of the paste into the shape of the top of the mould. Wet the
paste at the edge of the mould with beaten egg; then put on the top, and
press the top and side parts together. Cut a small piece of paste from
the centre of the top crust, add a little more paste to it, and roll a
little larger than the opening, which it is to cover. Cut the edges with
the jagging iron, and, with the other end of the iron, stamp leaves or
flowers. Place on the top of the pie. Bake in a slow oven three hours
and a half. While the pie is baking the sauce can be prepared. When the
bones and veal have been cooking two hours, add two cloves, a bouquet of
sweet herbs and the fried onions. Cook one hour longer; then salt and
pepper well, and strain. The water should be reduced in boiling to one
quart. When the pie is baked, take the centre piece from the cover, and
slightly press the tunnel into the opening. Pour slowly one pint of the
hot gravy through this. Put back the cover, and set away to cool. The
remainder of the gravy must be turned into a flat dish and put in a
cold place to harden. When the pie is served, place the mould in the
oven, or steamer, for about five minutes; then draw out the wires and
open it. Slip the pie on to a cold dish, and garnish with the jellied
gravy and parsley. This is nice for suppers or lunches. All kinds of
game and meat can be prepared in the same manner.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> P&acirc;t&eacute; de Foies Gras.</p>
<p>Make a paste with one quart of flour, as for raised pies, and put
away in a cool place. Put four fat goose livers in a pint of sweet milk
for two or three hours, to whiten them. Chop <i>very fine</i> two pounds
of fresh pork, cut from the loin (it must not be too fat), and one pound
of clear veal. Put one and a half cupfuls of milk on to boil with a
blade of mace, an onion, two cloves, a small piece of nutmeg and a
bouquet of sweet herbs. Cook all these for ten minutes; then strain the
milk upon four table-spoonfuls of butter and two of flour, which have
been well mixed. Add to this the chopped pork and veal and one of the
livers, chopped fine; stir over the fire for ten minutes, being careful
not to brown. Season well with pepper and salt, add four well-beaten
eggs, and stir half a minute longer; then put away to cool. Cut half a
pound of salt pork in slices as thin as shavings. Butter a French pie
mould, holding about three quarts. Form three-fourths of the paste into
a ball. Sprinkle the board with flour, and roll the paste out until
about one-fourth of an inch thick. Take it up by the four corners and
place it in the mould. Be very careful not to break it. With the hand,
press the paste on the sides and bottom. The crust must come to the top
of the mould. Put a layer of the pork shavings on the sides and bottom,
then a thick layer of the force-meat. Split the livers, and put half of
them in; over them sprinkle one table-spoonful of onion juice, salt,
pepper, and, if you like, a table-spoonful of capers. Another layer of
force-meat, again the liver and seasoning, and then the force-meat. On
this last layer put salt pork shavings. Into the remaining paste roll
three table-spoonfuls of washed butter, and roll the paste, as nearly as
possible, into the shape of the top of the pie mould. Cut a small piece
from the centre. The filling of the pie should have been heaped a little
toward the centre, leaving a space of about one inch and a half at the
edges. Brush with beaten egg the paste that is in this space. Put on the
top crust, and, with the fore-finger and thumb, press the two crusts
together. Roll the piece of paste cut from the centre of the cover a
little larger, and cover the opening with it. From some puff-paste
trimmings, cut out leaves, and decorate the cover with them. Place in a
moderate oven, and bake slowly two hours. Have a pint and a half of hot
veal stock (which will become jellied when cold) well seasoned with
pepper, salt, whole spice and onion. When the <i>p&acirc;t&eacute;</i>
is taken from the oven, take off the small piece that was put on the
centre of the cover. Insert a tunnel in the opening and pour the hot
stock through it. Replace the cover, and set away to cool. When the <i>p&acirc;t&eacute;</i>
is to be served, place it in the oven for about five minutes, that it
may slip from the mould easily. Draw out the wires which fasten the
sides of the mould, and slide the <i>p&acirc;t&eacute;</i> upon the
platter. Garnish the dish with parsley and small strips of cucumber
pickles.</p>
<p>Truffles and mushrooms can be cut up and put in the <i>p&acirc;t&eacute;</i>
in layers, the same as the liver and at the same time. The Strasburg fat
livers (<i>foies gras</i>) come in little stone pots, and cost from a
dollar to two dollars per pot.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chartreuse of Chicken.</p>
<p>Make the force-meat as for <i>quenelles</i> of chicken. Simmer two
large chickens in white stock for half an hour. Take up, and let cool.
Have a pickled tongue boiled tender. Cut thin slices from the breast of
the chickens, and cut these in squares. Cut the tongue in slices, and
these in turn in squares the same size as the chicken. Butter a
four-quart mould, and arrange the chicken and tongue handsomely on the
bottom and sides, being careful to have the pieces fit closely together.
Have note paper cut to fit the bottom and sides. Butter it well, and
cover about an inch deep with the force-meat. Take up the bottom piece
by the four corners and fit it into the mould, the meat side down. Pour
a little hot water into any kind of a flat-bottomed tin basin, and put
this in the mould and move it over the papers, to melt the butter; then
lift out the paper. Place the papers on the side in the same way as on
the bottom and melt the butter by rolling a bottle of hot water over
them. Remove these papers, and set the mould in a cold place until the
filling is ready. Cut from the tenderest part of the chicken enough meat
to make two quarts. Cut four large, or six small, mushrooms and four
truffles in strips. Put half a cupful of butter, half a large onion,
four cloves, a blade of mace, a slice of carrot, one of turnip and a
stalk of celery in a sauce-pan, and cook five minutes, stirring all the
while; then add five table-spoonfuls of flour. Stir until it begins to
brown, when add one quart of the stock in which the chickens were
cooked, a bouquet of sweet herbs, and salt and pepper. Simmer twenty
minutes; strain, and add to the chicken. Return to the fire, and simmer
twenty minutes longer, and set away to cool. When cold, put a layer of
the chicken in the mould, and a light layer of the truffles and
mushrooms. Continue this until the form is nearly full, and then cover
with the remainder of the force-meat. Spread buttered paper upon it, and
put in a cool place until cooking time, when steam two hours. Turn
carefully upon the dish. Brush over with three table-spoonfuls of melted
glaze. Pour one pint of supreme sauce around it, and serve.</p>
<p>The force-meat must be spread evenly on the paper and smoothed with
a knife that has been dipped in hot water. All kinds of meat <i>chartreuses</i>
can be made in this manner.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chartreuse of Vegetables and Game.</p>
<p>Six large carrots, six white turnips, two large heads of cabbage,
two onions, two quarts of stock, three grouse, one pint of brown sauce,
four table-spoonfuls of glaze, two cloves, a bouquet of sweet herbs, one
pound of mixed salt pork and one cupful of butter. Scrape and wash the
carrots, and peel and wash the turnips. Boil for twenty minutes in
salted water. Pour off the water, and add three pints of stock and a
teaspoonful of sugar. Simmer gently one hour. Take up, drain, and set
away to cool. Cut the cabbage in four parts. Wash, and boil twenty
minutes in salted water. Drain in the colander, and return to the fire
with a pint of stock, the cloves, herbs and onions, tied in a piece of
muslin; a quarter of a cupful of butter and the pork and grouse. Cover
the sauce-pan, and place where the contents will just simmer for two
hours and a half. When cooked, put the grouse and pork on a dish to
cool. Turn the cabbage into the colander, first taking out the spice and
onion. Press all the juice from the cabbage and chop very fine. Season
with salt and pepper, and put away to cool. Butter a plain mould holding
about four quarts. Butter note paper, cut to fit the sides and bottom,
and line the mould with it. Cut the cold turnips and carrots in thick
slices, and then in pieces all the same size and shape, but of any
design you wish. Line the sides and bottom of the mould with these,
being particular to have the pieces come together. Have the yellow and
white arranged in either squares or rows. With the chopped cabbage put
half a pint of the brown sauce and two spoonfuls of the glaze. Stir over
the fire for six minutes. Spread a thick layer of this on the
vegetables, being careful not to displace them. Cut each grouse into six
pieces. Season with salt and pepper, and pack closely in the mould.
Moisten with the remaining half pint of brown sauce. Cover with the
remainder of the cabbage. Two hours before serving time, place in a
steamer and cook. While the <i>chartreuse</i> is steaming, make the
sauce. Put two table-spoonfuls of butter in a stew-pan, and when hot,
add two table-spoonfuls of flour. Stir until a dark brown; then add the
stock in which the cabbage was cooked and enough of that in which the
turnips and carrots were cooked to make a quart. Stir until it boils;
add two spoonfuls of glaze, and set back where it will just simmer for
one hour. Skim off the fat, and strain. When the <i>chartreuse</i> is
done, take up and turn gently upon the dish. Lift the mould <i>very</i>
carefully. Take off the paper. Pour two table-spoonfuls of the sauce on
the <i>chartreuse</i> and the remainder around it. The vegetable <i>chartreuse</i>
can be made with any kind of game or meat.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chartreuse of Chicken and Macaroni.</p>
<p>One large fowl, about four and a half or five pounds, boiled tender;
half a box of gelatine, one cupful of broth in which the chicken was
boiled, one cupful of cream, salt, pepper, fourteen ounces of macaroni.
Just cover the fowl with boiling water, and simmer until very tender,
the time depending upon the age, but being from one to two hours if the
bird is not more than a year old. Take off all the skin and fat, and cut
the meat in thin, delicate pieces. Soak the gelatine two hours in half a
cupful of cold water, and dissolve it in the cupful of boiling broth;
add to the cream, and season highly. Have the chicken well seasoned,
also. Put the macaroni in a large flat pan with boiling water to cover,
and boil rapidly for three minutes. Drain off the water, and place the
macaroni on a board, having about twelve pieces in a bunch. Cut in
pieces about three-fourths of an inch long. Butter a two-quart mould (an
oval charlotte russe mould is the best) very thickly, and stick the
macaroni closely over the bottom and sides. When done, put the chicken
in lightly and evenly, and add the sauce very gradually. Steam one hour.
Serve either cold or hot. Great care must be taken in dishing. Place the
platter over the mould and turn platter and mould simultaneously. Let
the dish rest a minute, and then gently remove the mould. Serve
immediately. A long time is needed to line the mould with the macaroni,
but this is such a handsome, savory dish as to pay to have it
occasionally. If you prefer, you can use all broth, and omit the cream.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Galatine of Turkey.</p>
<p>Bone the turkey, and push the wings and legs inside of the body.
Make three pints of ham force-meat. Cut a cold boiled tongue in thin
slices. Season the turkey with salt and pepper, and spread on a board,
inside up. Spread a layer of the force-meat on this, and then a layer of
tongue. Continue this until all the tongue and force-meat are used. Roll
the bird into a round form, and sew up with mending cotton. Wrap tightly
in a strong piece of cotton cloth, which must be either pinned or sewed
to keep it in position. Put in a porcelain kettle the bones of the
turkey, two calf's feet, four pounds of the knuckle of veal, an onion,
two slices of turnip, two of carrot, twenty pepper-corns, four cloves,
two stalks of celery, one table-spoonful of salt and three quarts of
water. When this comes to a boil, skim, and put the turkey in. Set back
where it will just simmer for three hours. Take up and remove the
wrapping, put on a clean piece of cloth that has been wet in cold water,
and place in a dish. Put three bricks in a flat baking pan, and place on
top of the bird. Set away in a cool place over night. In the morning
take off the weights and cloth. Place on a dish, the smooth side up.
Melt four table-spoonfuls of glaze, and brush the turkey with it.
Garnish with the jelly, and serve. Or, the galatine can be cut in slices
and arranged on a number of dishes, if for a large party. In that case,
place a little jelly in the centre of each slice, and garnish the border
of the dish with jelly and parsley. The time and materials given are for
a turkey weighing about nine pounds. Any kind of fowl or bird can be
prepared in the same manner.</p>
<p>To make the jelly: Draw forward the kettle in which the turkey was
cooked, and boil the contents rapidly for one hour. Strain, and put away
to harden. In the morning scrape off all the fat and sediment. Put the
jelly in a clean sauce-pan with the whites and shells of two eggs that
have been beaten with four table-spoonfuls of cold water. Let this come
to a boil, and set back where it will just simmer for twenty minutes.
Strain through a napkin, and set away to harden.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Galatine of Veal.</p>
<p>Bone a breast of veal. Season well with salt and pepper. Treat the
same as turkey, using, however, two pounds of boiled ham instead of the
tongue. Cook four hours.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chicken in Jelly.</p>
<p>For each pound of chicken, a pint of water. Clean the chicken, and
put to boil. When it comes to a boil, skim carefully; and simmer gently
until the meat is very tender--about an hour and a half. Take out the
chicken, skin, and take all the flesh from the bones. Put the bones
again in the liquor, and boil until the water is reduced one half.
Strain, and set away to cool. Next morning skim off all the fat. Turn
the jelly into a clean sauce-pan, carefully removing all the sediment;
and to each quart of jelly add one-fourth of a package of gelatine
(which has been soaked an hour in half a cupful of cold water), an
onion, a stalk of celery, twelve pepper-corns, a small piece of mace,
four cloves, the white and shell of one egg and salt and pepper to
taste. Let it boil up; then set back where it will simmer twenty
minutes. Strain the jelly through a napkin. In a three-pint mould put a
layer of jelly about three-fourths of an inch deep. Set in ice water to
harden. Have the chicken cut in long, thin strips, and well seasoned
with salt and pepper; and when the jelly in the mould is hard, lay in
the chicken, lightly, and cover with the liquid jelly, which should be
cool, but not hard. Put away to harden. When ready to serve, dip the
mould in warm water and then turn into the centre of a flat dish.
Garnish with parsley, and, if you choose, with Tartare or mayonnaise
sauce.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chicken Chaud Froid.</p>
<p>Skin two chickens, and cut in small pieces as for serving. Wash, and
put them in a stew-pan with enough white stock to cover, and one large
onion, a clove, half a blade of mace, a bouquet of sweet herbs and half
a table-spoonful of salt. Let this come to a boil; then skim carefully,
and set back where it will simmer for one hour. Take up the chicken, and
set the stew-pan where the stock will boil rapidly. Put three
table-spoonfuls of butter in the frying-pan, and when it melts, stir in
two table-spoonfuls of flour, and cook until smooth, but not brown. Stir
this into the stock, of which there must be not more than a pint; add
four table-spoonfuls of glaze, and boil up once. Taste to see if
seasoned enough; if it is not, add more salt and pepper. Now add half a
cupful of cream, and let boil up once more. Have the chicken in a deep
dish. Pour this sauce on it, and set away to cool At serving time, have
large slices of cold boiled sweet potatoes, fried in butter till a
golden brown, handsomely arranged on a warm dish. On them place the
chicken, which must be very cold. On each piece of the meat put a small
teaspoonful of Tartare sauce. Heap the potatoes around the edge of the
dish, garnish with parsley, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> To Remove a Fillet from a Fowl or Bird.</p>
<p>Draw the skin off of the breast, and then run a sharp knife between
the flesh and the ribs and breast-bone. You will in this way separate
the two fillets from the body of the bird. The legs and wings of the
largest birds and fowl can be boned, and stuffed with force-meat, and
then prepared the same as, and served with, the fillet. The body of the
bird can be used for soups. Fillets from all kinds of birds can be
prepared the same as those from chickens.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chicken Fillets, Larded and Breaded.</p>
<p>Lard the fillets, having four fine strips of pork for each one, and
season with salt and pepper. Dip in beaten egg and in fine bread crumbs.
Fry ten minutes in boiling fat. Serve on a hot dish with a spoonful of
Tartare sauce on each.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chicken Fillets, Braised.</p>
<p>Lard the fillets as for breading. For each one lay a slice of fat
pork in the bottom of the braising pan, and on this a very small piece
of onion. Dredge the fillets well with salt, pepper and flour, and place
them on the pork and onion. Cover the pan, and set on the stove. Cook
slowly half an hour; then add one pint of light stock or water and the
bones of one of the chickens. Cover the pan, and place in a moderate
oven for one hour, basting frequently with the gravy. If the gravy
should cook away, add a little more stock or water, (there should be
nearly a pint of it at the end of the hour). Take up the fillets, and
drain; then cover them with soft butter, and dredge lightly with flour.
Broil till a light brown. Serve on a hot dish with the sauce poured
around. Or, they can be dressed on a mound of mashed potato, with a
garnish of any green vegetable at the base, the sauce to be poured
around it.</p>
<p>To make the sauce: Skim all the fat from the gravy in which the
fillets were cooked. Cook one table-spoonful of butter and one heaping
teaspoonful of flour together until a light brown; then add the gravy,
and boil up once. Taste to see if seasoned enough, and strain.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chicken Fillets, Saut&eacute;.</p>
<p>Flatten the fillets by pounding them lightly with the vegetable
masher. Season with pepper and salt, and dredge well with flour. Put in
the frying-pan one table-spoonful of butter for each fillet, and when
hot, put the fillets in, and cook rather slowly twenty minutes. Brown on
both sides. Take up, and keep hot while making the sauce. If there are
six fillets, add two table-spoonfuls of butter to that remaining in the
frying-pan, and when melted, stir in one table-spoonful of flour. Stir
until it begins to brown slightly; then slowly add one and a half
cupfuls of cold milk, stirring all the while. Let this boil one minute.
Season with salt, pepper and, if you like, a little mustard. Fill the
centre of a hot dish with green peas or mashed potatoes, against which
rest the fillets; and pour the sauce around. Serve very hot.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chicken Curry.</p>
<p>One chicken, weighing three pounds; three-fourths of a cupful of
butter, two large onions, one heaping table-spoonful of curry powder,
three tomatoes, or one cupful of the canned article, enough cayenne to
cover a silver three-cent piece, salt, one cupful of milk. Put the
butter and the onions, cut fine, on to cook. Stir all the while until
brown; then put in the chicken, which has been cut in small pieces, the
curry, tomatoes, salt and pepper. Stir well. Cover tightly, and let
simmer one hour, stirring occasionally; then add the milk. Boil up once,
and serve with boiled rice. This makes a very rich and hot curry, but
for the real lover of the dish, none too much so.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Veal Curry.</p>
<p>Two pounds of veal, treated in the same manner, but cooked two
hours. Mutton and lamb can be used in a like way.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chicken Quenelles.</p>
<p>One large chicken or tender fowl, weighing about three pounds; six
table-spoonfuls of butter, one table-spoonful of chopped salt pork,
three eggs, one teaspoonful of onion juice, one of lemon juice, half a
cupful of white stock or cream, one cupful of stale bread, one of new
milk, and salt and pepper to taste. Skin the chicken, take all the flesh
from the bones, and chop and pound <i>very</i> fine. Mix the pork with
it, and rub through a flour sieve. Cook the bread and milk together for
ten minutes, stirring often, to get smooth. Add this to the chicken, and
then add the seasoning, stock or cream, yolks of eggs, one by one, and
lastly the whites, which have been beaten to a stiff froth.</p>
<p>Cover the sides and bottom of a frying-pan with soft butter. Take
two table-spoons and a bowl of boiling water. Dip one spoon in the
water, and then fill it with force-meat, heaping it; then dip the other
spoon in the hot water, and turn the contents of the first into it. This
gives the <i>quenelle</i> the proper shape; and it should at once be
slipped into the frying-pan. Continue the operation until all the meat
is shaped. Cover the quenelles with white stock, boiling, and slightly
salted, and cook gently twenty minutes. Take them up, and drain for a
minute; then arrange on a border of mashed potatoes or fried bread. Pour
a spoonful of either Bechamel, mushroom or olive sauce on each, and the
remainder in the centre of the dish. Serve hot.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chicken Quenelles, Stuffed.</p>
<p>Prepare the force-meat as for <i>quenelles</i>. Soak four
table-spoonfuls of gelatine for one hour in cold water to cover. Put two
table-spoonfuls of butter in a frying-pan, and when hot, add one
table-spoonful of flour. Stir until smooth, but not brown; then
gradually stir in one pint of cream. Add one table-spoonful of lemon
juice, a speck of mace and plenty of salt and pepper. Cook for two
minutes. Stir in the soaked gelatine, and remove from the fire. Into
this sauce stir one pint and a half of cold chicken, cut <i>very</i>
fine. Set away to cool. Butter eighteen small egg cups, and cover the
sides and bottoms with a thick layer of the force-meat. Fill the centre
with the prepared force-meat, which should be quite firm. Cover with
chicken. Place the cups in a steamer and cover them with sheets of thick
paper. Put on the cover of the steamer, and place upon a kettle of
boiling water for half an hour. Do not let the water boil too rapidly.
Take up, and put away to cool. When cold, dip the <i>quenelles</i> twice
in beaten egg and in bread crumbs. Fry in boiling fat for three minutes.
Serve hot with a garnish of stoned olives.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chicken Quenelles, Breaded.</p>
<p>Prepare the <i>quenelles</i> as before, and when they have been
boiled, drain, and let them grow cold. Dip in beaten egg and roll in
bread crumbs; place in the frying basket and plunge into boiling fat.
Cook three minutes. Serve with fried parsley or any kind of brown sauce.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Veal Quenelles.</p>
<p>One pound of clear veal, one cupful of white sauce, six
table-spoonfuls of butter, one cupful of bread crumbs, one of milk, four
eggs, salt, pepper, a slight grating of nutmeg and the juice of half a
lemon. Make and use the same as chicken <i>quenelles</i>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chicken Pilau.</p>
<p>Cut a chicken into pieces the size you wish to serve at the table.
Wash clean, and put in a stew-pan with about one-eighth of a pound of
salt pork, which has been cut in small pieces. Cover with cold water,
and boil gently until the chicken begins to grow tender, which will be
in about an hour, unless the chicken is old. Season rather highly with
salt and pepper, add three tea-cupfuls of rice, which has been picked
and washed, and let boil thirty or forty minutes longer. There should be
a good quart of liquor in the stew-pan when the rice is added. Care must
be taken that it does not burn. Instead of chicken any kind of meat may
be used.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chicken Souffl&eacute;.</p>
<p>One pint of cooked chicken, finely chopped; one pint of cream sauce,
four eggs, one teaspoonful of chopped parsley, one teaspoonful of onion
juice, salt, pepper. Stir the chicken and seasoning into the boiling
sauce. Cook two minutes. Add the yolks of the eggs, well beaten, and set
away to cool. When cold, add the whites, beaten to a stiff froth. Turn
into a buttered dish, and bake half an hour. Serve with mushroom or
cream sauce. This dish must be served the moment it is baked. Any kind
of delicate meat can be used, the <i>souffl&eacute;</i> taking the name
of the meat of which it is made.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Fried Chicken.</p>
<p>Cut the chicken into six or eight pieces. Season well with salt and
pepper. Dip in beaten egg and then in fine bread crumbs in which there
is one teaspoonful of chopped parsley for every cupful of crumbs. Dip
again in the egg and crumbs. Fry ten minutes in boiling fat. Cover the
centre of a cold dish with Tartare sauce. Arrange the chicken on this,
and garnish with a border of pickled beets. Or, it can be served with
cream sauce.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Blanquette of Chicken.</p>
<p>One quart of cooked chicken, cut in delicate pieces; one large
cupful of white stock, three table-spoonfuls of butter, a heaping
table-spoonful of flour, one teaspoonful of lemon juice, one cupful of
cream or milk, the yolks of four eggs, salt, pepper: Put the butter in
the sauce-pan, and when hot, add the flour. Stir until smooth, but not
brown. Add the stock, and cook two minutes; then add the seasoning and
cream. As soon as this boils up, add the chicken. Cook ten minutes. Beat
the yolks of the eggs with four table-spoonfuls of milk. Stir into the
blanquette. Cook about half a minute longer. This can be served in a
rice or potato border, in a <i>cr&ocirc;ustade</i>, on a hot dish, or
with a garnish of toasted or fried bread.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Blanquette of Veal and Ham.</p>
<p>Half a pint of boiled ham, one pint and a half of cooked veal, one
pint of cream sauce, one teaspoonful of lemon juice, the yolks of two
uncooked eggs, salt, pepper, two hard-boiled eggs. Have the veal and ham
cut in delicate pieces, which add with the seasoning to the sauce. When
it boils up, add the yolks, which have been beaten with four
table-spoonfuls of milled Cook half a minute longer. Garnish with the
hard-boiled eggs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Salmis of Game,</p>
<p>Take the remains of a game dinner, say two or three grouse. Cut all
the meat from the bones, in as handsome pieces as possible, and set
aside. Break up the bones, and put on to boil with three pints of water
and two cloves. Boil down to a pint and a half. Put three
table-spoonfuls of butter and two onions, cut in slices, on to fry. Stir
all the time until the onions begin to brown; then add two spoonfuls of
flour, and stir until a rich dark brown. Strain the broth on this. Stir
a minute, and add one teaspoonful of lemon juice and salt and pepper to
taste; if you like, one table-spoonful of Leicestershire sauce, also.
Add the cold game, and simmer fifteen minutes. Serve on slices of fried
bread. Garnish with fried bread and parsley.</p>
<p>This dish can be varied by using different kinds of seasoning, and
by serving sometimes with rice, and sometimes with mashed potatoes, for
a border. Half a dozen mushrooms is a great addition to the dish, if
added about five minutes before serving. A table-spoonful of curry
powder, mixed with a little cold water, and stirred in with the other
seasoning, will give a delicious curry of game. When curry is used, the
rice border is the best of those mentioned above.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Game Cutlets &agrave; la Royale.</p>
<p>One quart of the tender parts of cold game, cut into dice; one
generous pint of rich stock, one-third of a box of gelatine, one quart
of any kind of force-meat, four cloves, one table-spoonful of onion
juice, two of butter, one of flour, three eggs, one pint of bread or
cracker crumbs, salt, pepper. Soak the gelatine for one hour in half a
cupful of cold water. Put the butter in a frying-pan, and when hot, add
the flour. Stir until smooth and brown, and add the stock and seasoning.
Simmer ten minutes; strain upon the game, and simmer fifteen minutes
longer. Beat an egg and add to the gelatine. Stir this into the game and
sauce and take from the fire instantly. Place the stew-pan in a basin of
cold water, and stir until it begins to cool; then turn the mixture into
a shallow baking pan, having it about an inch thick. Set on the ice to
harden. When hard, cut into cutlet-shaped pieces with a knife that has
been dipped in hot water. When all the mixture is cut, put the pan in
another of warm water for half a minute. This will loosen the cutlets
from the bottom of the pan. Take them out carefully, cover every part of
each cutlet with force-meat, and set on ice until near serving time.
When ready to cook them, beat the two eggs with a spoon. Cover the
cutlets with this and the crumbs. Place a few at a time in the frying
basket, and plunge them into boiling fat. Fry two minutes. Drain, and
place on brown paper until all are cooked. Arrange them in a circle on a
hot dish. Pour mushroom sauce in the centre, garnish with parsley, and
serve. Poultry cutlets can be prepared and served in the same way.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Cutlets &agrave; la Duchesse.</p>
<p>Two pounds of Lamb, mutton or veal cutlets, one large cupful of
cream, one table-spoonful of onion juice, four table-Spoonfuls of
butter, one of flour, two whole eggs, the yolks of four more, two
table-spoonfuls of finely-chopped ham, one of lemon juice and salt and
pepper to taste. Put two table-spoonfuls of the butter in the
frying-pan. Season the cutlets with salt and pepper, and when the butter
is hot, put them in it. Fry gently for five minutes, if lamb or mutton,
but if veal, put a cover on the pan, and fry very slowly for fifteen
minutes. Set away to cool. Put the remainder of the butter in a small
frying-pan, and when hot, stir in the flour. Cook one minute, stirring
all the time, and being careful not to brown. Stir in the cream. Have
the ham, the yolks of eggs and the onion and lemon juice beaten
together. Stir this mixture into the boiling sauce. Stir for about one
minute, and remove from the fire. Season well with pepper and salt. Dip
the cutlets in this sauce, being careful to cover every part, and set
away to cool. When cold, dip them in beaten egg and in bread crumbs. Fry
in boiling fat for one minute. Arrange them in a circle on a hot dish,
and have green peas in the centre and cream sauce poured around.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Cutlets served in Papillotes.</p>
<p>Fold and cut half sheets of thick white paper, about the size of
commercial note, so that when opened they will be heart-shaped. Dip them
in melted butter and set aside. After trimming all the fat from lamb or
mutton chops, season them with pepper and salt. Put three
table-spoonfuls of butter in the frying pan, and when melted, lay in the
chops, and cook slowly for fifteen minutes. Add one teaspoonful of
finely-chopped parsley, one teaspoonful of lemon juice and one
table-spoonful of Halford sauce. Dredge with one heaping table-spoonful
of flour, and cook quickly five minutes longer. Take up the cutlets, and
add to the sauce in the pan four table-spoonfuls of glaze and four of
water. Stir until the glaze is melted, and set away to cool. When the
sauce is cold, spread it on the cutlets. Now place these, one by one, on
one side of the papers, having the bones turned toward the centre. Fold
the papers and carefully turn in the edges. When all are done, place
them in a pan, and put into a moderate oven for ten minutes; then place
them in a circle, and fill the centre of the dish with thin fried, or
French fried, potatoes. Serve very hot. The quantities given above are
for six cutlets.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Veal Cutlets with White Sauce.</p>
<p>One and a half pounds of cutlets, two table-spoonfuls of butter, a
slice of carrot and a small slice of onion. Put the butter and the
vegetables, cut fine, in a sauce-pan. Season the cutlets with salt and
pepper, and lay them on the butter and vegetables. Cover tightly, and
cook slowly for half an hour; then take out, and dip in egg and bread
crumbs, and fry in boiling fat till a golden brown. Or, dip the cutlets
in soil butter and then in flour, and broil. Serve with white sauce
poured around. Put a quart of green peas, or points of asparagus, in the
centre of the dish, and arrange the cutlets around them. Pour on the
sauce. This gives a handsome dish. Or, serve with olive sauce.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Mutton Cutlets, Crumbed.</p>
<p>Season French chops with salt and pepper, dip them in melted butter,
and roll in <i>fine</i> bread crumbs. Broil for eight minutes over a
fire not too bright, as the crumbs burn easily. Serve with potato balls
heaped in the centre of the dish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Mutton Cutlets, Breaded.</p>
<p>Trim the cutlets, and season with salt and pepper. Dip in beaten egg
and in bread crumbs, and fry in boiling fat. If three-quarters of an
inch thick, they will be done rare in six minutes, and well done in ten.
Arrange in the centre of a hot dish, and pour tomato sauce around them.
One pint of sauce is enough for two pounds of cutlets.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Stewed Steak with Oysters.</p>
<p>Two pounds of rump steak, one pint of oysters, one table-spoonful of
lemon juice, three of butter, one of flour, salt, pepper, one cupful of
water. Wash the oysters in the water, and drain into a stew-pan. Put
this liquor on to heat. As soon as it comes to a boil, skim, and set
back. Put the butter in a frying-pan, and when hot, put in the steak.
Cook ten minutes. Take up the steak, and stir the flour into the butter
remaining in the pan. Stir until a dark brown. Add the oyster liquor,
and boil one minute. Season with salt and pepper. Put back the steak,
cover the pan, and simmer half an hour; then add the oysters and lemon
juice. Boil one minute. Serve on a hot dish with points of toast for a
garnish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Rice Borders.</p>
<p>These are prepared in two ways. The first is to boil the rice as for
a vegetable, and, with a spoon, heap it lightly around the edge of the
fricassee, ragout, etc. The second method is a little more difficult.
Put one cupful of rice on to boil in three cupfuls of cold water. When
it has been boiling half an hour, add two table-spoonfuls of butter and
one heaping teaspoonful of salt. Set back where it will just simmer, and
cook one hour longer. Mash very fine with a spoon, add two well-beaten
eggs, and stir for three minutes. Butter a plain border mould, and fill
with the rice. Place in the heater for ten minutes. Turn upon a hot
dish. Fill the centre with a fricassee, salmis or blanquette, and serve
hot. A mould with a border two inches high and wide, and having a space
in the centre five and a half inches wide and eleven long, is pretty and
convenient for rice and potato borders, and also for jelly borders, with
which to decorate salads, boned chicken, creams, etc.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Potato Border.</p>
<p>Six potatoes, three eggs, one table-spoonful of butter, one of salt,
half a cupful of boiling milk. Pare, boil and mash the potatoes. When
fine and light, add the butter, salt and pepper and two well-beaten
eggs. Butter the border mould and pack the potato in it. Let this stand
on the kitchen table ten minutes; then turn out on a dish and brush over
with one well-beaten egg. Brown in the oven. Fill the centre with a
curry, fricassee, salmis or blanquette.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> To Make a Cr&ocirc;ustade.</p>
<p>The bread for the <i>cr&ocirc;ustade</i> must not be too light, and
should be at least three days old. If the loaf is round, it can be
carved into the form of a vase, or if long, into the shape of a boat.
Have a very sharp knife, and cut slowly and carefully, leaving the
surface as smooth as possible. There are two methods by which it can be
browned: one is to plunge it into a deep pot of boiling fat for about
one minute; the other is to butter the entire surface of the bread and
put it into a hot oven, being careful not to let it burn. Care must be
taken that the inside is as brown as the outside; if not, the sauce will
soak through the cr&ocirc;ustade and spoil it. Creamed oysters, stewed
lobster, chicken, or any kind of meat that is served in a sauce, can be
served in the cr&ocirc;ustade,</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Cheese Souffl&eacute;.</p>
<p>Two table-spoonfuls of butter, one heaping table-spoonful of flour,
half a cupful of milk, one cupful of grated cheese, three eggs, half a
teaspoonful of salt, a speck of cayenne. Put the butter in a sauce-pan,
and when hot, add the flour, and stir until smooth, but not browned. Add
the milk and seasoning. Cook two minutes; then add the yolks of the
eggs, well beaten, and the cheese. Set away to cool. When cold, add the
whites, beaten to a stiff froth. Turn into a buttered dish, and bake
from twenty to twenty-five minutes. Serve the moment it comes from the
oven. The dish in which this is baked should hold a quart. An escalop
dish is the best.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Rissoles.</p>
<p>Roll the trimmings from pie crust into a sheet about a sixth of an
inch thick. Cut this in cakes with the largest patty cutter. Have any
kind of meat or fish prepared as for croquettes. Put a heaping
teaspoonful on each cake. Brush the edges of the paste with beaten egg,
and then fold and press together. When all are done, dip in beaten egg
and fry brown in boiling fat. They should cook about eight minutes.
Serve hot.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Fritter Batter.</p>
<p>One pint of flour, half a pint of milk, one table-spoonful of salad
oil or butter, one teaspoonful of salt, two eggs. Beat the eggs light.
Add the milk and salt to them. Pour half of this mixture on the flour,
and when beaten light and smooth, add the remainder and the oil. Fry in
boiling fat. Sprinkle with sugar, and serve on a hot dish. This batter
is nice for all kinds of fritters.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Fritter Batter, No. 2.</p>
<p>One pint of flour, one teaspoonful of salt, one of sugar, one of
cream of tartar, half a teaspoonful of soda, one table-spoonful of oil,
one egg, half a pint of milk. Mix the flour, salt, sugar, cream of
tartar and soda together, and rub through a sieve. Beat the egg very
light, and add the milk. Stir half of this on the flour, and when the
batter is light and smooth, add the remainder, and finally the oil.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chicken Fritters.</p>
<p>Cut cold roasted or boiled chicken or fowl in small pieces, and
place in an earthen dish. Season well with salt, pepper and the juice of
a fresh lemon. Let the meat stand one hour; then make a fritter batter,
and stir the pieces into it. Drop, by the spoonful, into boiling fat,
and fry till a light brown. Drain, and serve immediately. Any kind of
cold meat, if tender, can be used in this way.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Apple Fritters.</p>
<p>Pare and core the apples, and cut in slices about one-third of an
inch thick. Dip in the batter, and fry six minutes in boiling fat. Serve
on a hot dish. The apples may be sprinkled with sugar and a little
nutmeg, and let stand an hour before being fried. In that case, sprinkle
them with sugar when you serve them.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Fruit Fritters.</p>
<p>Peaches, pears, pineapples, bananas, etc., either fresh or canned,
are used for fritters. If you choose, when making fruit fritters, you
can add two table-spoonfuls of sugar to the batter.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Oyster Fritters.</p>
<p>One pint of oysters, two eggs, one pint of flour, one heaping
teaspoonful of salt, one table-spoonful of salad oil, enough water with
the oyster liquor to make a scant half pint. Drain and chop the oysters.
Add the water and salt to the liquor. Pour part of this on the flour,
and when smooth, add the remainder. Add the oil and the eggs, well
beaten. Stir the oysters into the batter. Drop small spoonfuls of this
into boiling fat, and fry until brown. Drain, and serve hot.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Clam Fritters.</p>
<p>Drain and chop a pint of clams, and season with salt and pepper.
Make a fritter batter as directed, using, however, a <i>heaping</i> pint
of flour, as the liquor in the clams thins the batter. Stir the clams
into this, and fry in boiling fat.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Cream Fritters.</p>
<p>One pint of milk, the yolks of six, and whites of two, eggs, two
table-spoonfuls of sugar, half a pint of flour, three heaping
table-spoonfuls of butter, half a teaspoonful of salt, a slight
flavoring of lemon, orange, nutmeg, or anything else you please. Put
half of the milk on in the double boiler, and mix the flour to a smooth
paste with the other half. When the milk boils, stir this into it Cook
for five minutes, stirring constantly; then add the butter, sugar, salt
and flavoring. Beat the eggs well, and stir them into the boiling
mixture. Cook one minute. Butter a shallow cake pan, and pour in the
mixture. Have it about half an inch deep in the pan. Set away to cool.
When cold, cut into small squares. Dip these in beaten egg and in
crumbs, place in the frying basket, and plunge into boiling fat. Fry
tall a golden brown. Arrange on a hot dish, sprinkle sugar over them,
and serve <i>very hot</i>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Potato Fritters.</p>
<p>One pint of boiled and mashed potato, half a cupful of hot milk,
three table-spoonfuls of butter, three of sugar, two eggs, a little
nutmeg, one teaspoonful of salt. Add the milk, butter, sugar and
seasoning to the mashed potato, and then add the eggs well beaten. Stir
until very smooth and light. Spread, about half an inch deep, on a
buttered dish, and set away to cool. When cold, cut into squares. Dip in
beaten egg and in bread crumbs, and fry brown in boiling fat. Serve
immediately.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Croquettes.</p>
<p>Care and practice are required for successfully making croquettes.
The meat must be chopped fine, all the ingredients be thoroughly mixed,
and the whole mixture be as moist as possible without spoiling the
shape. Croquettes are formed in pear, round and cylindrical shapes. The
last is the best, as the croquettes can be moister in this form than in
the two others.</p>
<p>To shape: Take about a table-spoonful of the mixture, and with both
hands, shape in the form of a cylinder. Handle as gently and carefully
as if a tender bird. Pressure forces the particles apart, and thus
breaks the form. Have a board sprinkled lightly with bread or cracker
crumbs, and roll the croquettes <i>very gently</i> on this. Remember
that the slightest pressure will break them. Let them lie on the board
until all are finished, when, if any have become flattened, roll them
into shape again. Cover a board <i>thickly</i> with crumbs. Have beaten
eggs, slightly salted, in a deep plate. Hold a croquette in the left
hand, and with a brush, or the right hand, cover it with the egg; then
roll in the crumbs. Continue this until they are all crumbed. Place a
few at a time in the frying basket (they should not touch each other),
and plunge into boiling fat. Cook till a rich brown. It will take about
a minute and a half. Take up, and lay on brown paper in a warm pan.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Royal Croquettes.</p>
<p>Three small, or two large, sweetbreads, one boiled chicken, one
large table-spoonful of flour, one pint of cream, half a cupful of
butter, one table-spoonful of onion juice, one table-spoonful of chopped
parsley, one teaspoonful of mace, the juice of half a lemon, and salt
and pepper to taste. Let the sweetbreads stand in boiling water five
minutes. Chop very fine, with the chicken, and add seasoning. Put two
table-spoonfuls of the butter in a stew-pan with the flour. When it
bubbles, add the cream, gradually; then add the chopped mixture, and
stir until thoroughly heated. Take from the fire, add the lemon juice,
and set away to cool. Roll into shape with cracker crumbs. Dip in six
beaten eggs and then in cracker crumbs. Let them stand until dry, when
dip again in egg, and finally in bread crumbs--not too fine. All the
crumbs should first be salted and peppered. Fry quickly in boiling fat.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Royal Croquettes, No. 2.</p>
<p>Half a boiled chicken, one large sweetbread, cleaned, and kept in
hot water for five minutes; a calf's brains, washed, and boiled five
minutes; one teaspoonful of chopped parsley, salt, pepper, half a pint
of cream, one egg, quarter of a cupful of butter, one table-spoonful of
corn-starch. Chop the chicken, brains and sweetbread very fine, and add
the egg well beaten. Mix the corn-starch with a little of the cream.
Have the remainder of the cream boiling, and stir in the mixed
corn-starch; then add the butter and the chopped mixture, and stir over
the fire until it bubbles. Set aside to cool. Shape, and roll twice in
egg and in cracker crumbs. Put in the frying basket, and plunge into
boiling fat. They should brown in less than a minute. [Mrs. Furness, of
Philadelphia.]</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Oyster Croquettes.</p>
<p>Haifa pint of raw oysters, half a pint of cooked veal, one heaping
table-spoonful of butter, three table-spoonfuls of cracker crumbs, the
yolks of two eggs, one table-spoonful of onion juice. Chop the oysters
and veal very fine. Soak the crackers in oyster liquor, and then mix all
the ingredients, and shape. Dip in egg and roll in cracker crumbs, and
fry as usual. The butter should be softened before the mixing.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Lobster Croquettes.</p>
<p>Chop fine the meat of a two-pound lobster; take also two
table-spoonfuls of butter, enough water or cream to make very moist, one
egg, salt and pepper to taste, and half a table-spoonful of flour. Cook
butter and flour together till they bubble. Add the cream or water
(about a scant half cupful), then the lobster and seasoning, and, when
hot, the egg well beaten. Set away to cool. Shape, dip in egg and
cracker crumbs, and fry as usual.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Salmon Croquettes.</p>
<p>One pound of cooked salmon (about a pint and a half when chopped),
one cupful of cream, two table-spoonfuls of butter, one of flour, three
eggs, one pint of crumbs, pepper, salt. Chop the salmon fine. Mix the
flour and butter together. Let the cream come to a boil, and stir in the
flour, butter, salmon and seasoning. Boil for one minute. Stir into it
one well-beaten egg, and remove from the fire. When cold, shape, and
proceed as for other croquettes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Shad Roe Croquettes.</p>
<p>One pint of cream, four table-spoonfuls of corn-starch, four shad
roe, four table-spoonfuls of butter, one teaspoonful of salt, the juice
of two lemons, a slight grating of nutmeg and a speck of cayenne. Boil
the roe fifteen minutes in salted water; then drain and mash. Put the
cream on to boil. Mix the butter and corn-starch together, and stir into
the boiling cream. Add the seasoning and roe. Boil up once, and set away
to cool. Shape and fry as directed. [Miss Lizzie Devereux.]</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Rice and Meat Croquettes.</p>
<p>One cupful of boiled rice, one cupful of finely-chopped cooked
meat--any kind; one teaspoonful of salt, a little pepper, two
table-spoonfuls of butter,--half a cupful of milk, one egg. Put the milk
on to boil, and add the meat, rice and seasoning. When this boils, add
the egg, well beaten; stir one minute. After cooling, shape, dip in egg
and crumbs, and fry as before directed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Rice Croquettes.</p>
<p>One large cupful of cooked rice, half a cupful of milk, one egg, one
table-spoonful of sugar, one of butter, half a teaspoonful of salt, a
slight grating of nutmeg. Put milk on to boil, and add rice and
seasoning. When it boils up, add the egg, well beaten. Stir one minute;
then take off and cool. When cold, shape, and roll in egg and crumbs, as
directed. Serve very hot. Any flavoring can be substituted for the
nutmeg.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Potato Croquettes.</p>
<p>Pare, boil and mash six good-sized potatoes. Add one table-spoonful
of butter, two-thirds of a cupful of hot cream or milk, the whites of
two eggs, well beaten, and salt and pepper to taste. If you wish, use
also a slight grating of nutmeg, or a teaspoonful of lemon juice. Let
the mixture cool slightly, then shape, roll in egg and crumbs, and fry.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chicken Croquettes.</p>
<p>One <i>solid</i> pint of finely-chopped cooked chicken, one
table-spoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of pepper, one cupful of
cream or chicken stock, one table-spoonful of flour, four eggs, one
teaspoonful of onion juice, one table-spoonful of lemon juice, one pint
of crumbs, three table-spoonfuls of butter. Put the cream or stock on to
boil. Mix the flour and butter together, and stir into the boiling
cream; then add the chicken and seasoning. Boil for two minutes, and add
two of the eggs, well beaten. Take from the fire immediately, and set
away to cool. When cold, shape and fry.</p>
<p>Many people think a teaspoonful of chopped parsley an improvement,</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Other Croquettes.</p>
<p>Veal, mutton, lamb, beef and turkey can be prepared in the same
manner as chicken. Very dry, tough meat is not suitable for croquettes.
Tender roasted pieces give the finest flavor.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Large Vol-au-Vent.</p>
<p>Make puff or chopped paste, according to the rule given, and let it
get chilled through; roll it again four times, the last time leaving it
a piece about seven inches square. Put in the ice chest for at least
half an hour; then roll into a ten-inch square. Place on this a plate or
a round tin, nine and a half inches in diameter, and, with a sharp
knife, cut around the edge. Place another plate, measuring seven inches
or a little more, in the centre. Dip a case-knife in hot water and cut
around the plate, having the knife go two-thirds through the paste.
Place the paste in a flat baking pan and put in a hot oven. After twelve
or fifteen minutes close the drafts, to slacken the heat, and cook half
an hour longer, being careful not to let it burn. As soon as the <i>vol-au-vent</i>
is taken from the oven, lift out the centre piece with a case-knife, and
take out the uncooked paste with a spoon. Return the cover. At the time
of serving place in the oven to heat through; then fill and cover, and
serve while hot The <i>vol-au-vent</i> can be made and baked the day
before using, if more convenient. Heat it and fill as directed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Vol-au-Vent of Chicken.</p>
<p>Cut into dice one and a half pints of cooked chicken, and season
with salt and pepper. Make a cream sauce, which season well with salt
and pepper; and, if you like, add half a teaspoonful of onion juice and
the same quantity of mixed mustard. Heat the chicken in this, and fill
the <i>vol-au-vent</i>. All kinds of poultry and other meats can be
used for a <i>vol-au-vent</i> with this sauce.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Vol-au-Vent of Sweetbreads.</p>
<p>Clean and wash two sweetbreads, and boil twenty minutes in water to
cover. Drain and cool them, and cut into dice. Heat in cream sauce, and
fill the <i>vol-au-vent</i>. Serve hot.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Vol-au-Vent of Salmon.</p>
<p>Heat one pint and a half of cooked salmon in cream sauce. Fill the <i>vol-au-vent</i>,
and serve hot. Any rich, delicate fish can be served in a <i>vol-au-vent</i>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Vol-au-Vent of Oysters.</p>
<p>Prepare the vol-au-vent as directed. Put one quart of oysters on to
boil in their own liquor. As soon as a scum, rises, skim it off, and
drain the oysters. Return half a pint of the oyster liquor to the
sauce-pan. Mix two heaping table-spoonfuls of butter with a scant one of
flour, and when light and creamy, gradually turn on it the boiling
oyster liquor. Season well with salt, pepper and, if you like, a little
nutmeg or mace, (it must be only a "shadow"). Boil up once, and add
three table-spoonfuls of cream and the oysters. Stir over the fire for
half a minute. Fill the case, cover, and serve immediately.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Vol-au-Vent of Lobster.</p>
<p>Rub together four table-spoonfuls of butter and one and a half of
flour. Pour on this, gradually, one pint of boiling white stock. Let it
boil up once, and add the juice of half a lemon, salt and a speck of
cayenne; add, also, the yolks of two eggs, beaten with a spoonful of
cold water, and the meat of two small lobsters, cut into dice. Stir for
one minute over the fire. Fill the case, put on the cover, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Patties.</p>
<p>Make puff paste as directed. (See puff paste.) After it has been
rolled four times, put it on ice to harden. When hard, roll again twice.
The last time leave the paste about an inch thick. Put in the ice chest
to get very firm; then put on the board, and gently roll it down to
three-quarters of an inch in thickness. Great care must be taken to have
every part equally thick. Cut out pieces with a round tin cutter three
and a half inches in diameter, and place in the pans. Take another
cutter two and a half inches in diameter, dip it in hot water, place in
the centre of the patty, and cut about two-thirds through. In doing
this, do not press down directly, but use a rotary motion. These centre
pieces, which are to form the covers, easily separate from the rest when
baked. Place in a very hot oven. When they have been baking ten minutes
close the drafts, to reduce the heat; bake twenty minutes longer. Take
from the oven, remove the centre pieces, and, with a teaspoon, dig out
the uncooked paste. Fill with prepared fish or meat, put on the covers,
and serve. Or, if more convenient to bake them early in the day, or,
indeed, the previous day, put them in the oven twelve minutes before
serving, and they will be nearly as nice as if fresh baked. The
quantities given will make eighteen patties.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chicken Patties.</p>
<p>Prepare the cream the same as for oysters, and add to it one pint of
cold chicken, cut into dice. Boil three minutes. Fill the shells and
serve. Where it is liked, one teaspoonful of onion juice is an
improvement. Other poultry and all game can be served in patties the
same as chicken.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Veal Patties.</p>
<p>Put in a stew-pan a generous half pint of white sauce with a pint of
cooked veal, cut into dice, and a teaspoonful of lemon juice. Stir until
very hot. Fill the shells, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Lobster Patties.</p>
<p>One pint of lobster, cut into dice; half a pint of white sauce, a
speck of cayenne, one-eighth of a teaspoonful of mustard. Heat all
together. Fill the shells and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Oyster Patties.</p>
<p>One pint of small oysters, half a pint of cream, a large
tea-spoonful of flour, salt, pepper. Let the cream come to a boil. Mix
the flour with a little cold milk, and stir into the boiling cream.
Season with salt and pepper. While the cream is cooking let the oysters
come to a boil in their own liquor. Skim carefully, and drain off all
the liquor. Add the oysters to the cream, and boil up once. Fill the
patty shells, and serve. The quantities given are enough for eighteen
shells.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Crust Patties.</p>
<p>Cut a loaf of stale bread in slices an inch thick. With the patty
cutter, press out as many pieces as you wish patties, and with a smaller
cutter, press half through each piece. Place this second cutter as near
the centre as possible when using. Put the pieces in the frying basket
and plunge into boiling fat for half a minute. Take out and drain, and
with a knife, remove the centre crusts and take out the soft bread; then
fill, and put on the centre pieces.</p>
<p>Filling for crusts: Put two table-spoonfuls of butter in the
frying-pan, and when hot, add one of flour. Stir until smooth and brown.
Add one cupful of stock. Boil one minute, and stir in one pint of cooked
veal, cut rather fine. Season with salt, pepper, and a little lemon
juice. When hot, fill the crusts. Any kind of cold meat can be served
in this manner.</p>
<p><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Sweetbreads.</span></p>
<p>Sweetbreads are found in calves and lambs. The demand for calves'
sweetbreads has grown wonderfully within the past ten years. In all our
large cities they sell at all times of the year for a high price, but in
winter and early spring they cost more than twice as much as they do
late in the spring and during the summer. The throat and heart
sweetbreads are often sold as one, but in winter, when they bring a very
high price, the former is sold for the same price as the latter. The
throat sweetbread is found immediately below the throat. It has an
elongated form, is not so firm and fat, and has not the fine flavor of
the heart sweetbread. The heart sweetbread is attached to the last rib,
and lies near the heart. The form is somewhat rounded, and it is smooth
and firm.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> To Clean Sweetbreads.</p>
<p>Carefully pull off all the tough and fibrous skin. Place them in a
dish of cold water for ten minutes or more, and they are then ready to
be boiled. They must always be boiled twenty minutes, no matter what the
mode of cooking is to be.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Sweetbreads Larded and Baked.</p>
<p>When the sweetbreads have been cleaned, draw through each one four
very thin pieces of pork (about the size of a match). Drop them into
cold water for five or ten minutes, then into hot water, and boil twenty
minutes. Take out, spread with butter, dredge with salt, pepper and
flour, and bake twenty minutes in a quick oven. Serve with green peas,
well drained, seasoned with salt and butter, and heaped in the centre of
the dish. Lay the sweetbreads around them, and pour a cream sauce around
the edge of the dish. Garnish with parsley. One pint of cream sauce is
sufficient for eight or ten sweetbreads.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Sweetbread Saut&eacute;.</p>
<p>One sweetbread, after being boiled, split and cut in four pieces.
Season with salt and pepper. Put in a small frying-pan one small
table-spoonful of butter and the same quantity of flour. When hot, put
in the sweetbreads; turn constantly until a light brown. They will fry
in about eight minutes. Serve with cream sauce or tomato sauce.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Broiled Sweetbreads.</p>
<p>Split the sweetbread after being boiled. Season with salt and
pepper, rub thickly with butter and sprinkle with flour. Broil over a
rather quick fire, turning constantly. Cook about ten minutes, and serve
with cream sauce.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Breaded Sweetbreads.</p>
<p>After being boiled, split them, and season with salt and pepper;
then dip in beaten egg and cracker crumbs. Fry a light brown in hot
lard. Serve with tomato sauce.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Sweetbreads in Cases.</p>
<p>Cut the sweetbreads, after being boiled, in very small pieces.
Season with salt and pepper, and moisten well with cream sauce. Fill the
paper cases, and cover with bread crumbs. Brown, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Pancakes.</p>
<p>Six eggs, a pint of milk, one heaping teaspoonful of salt, one
cupful of flour, one table-spoonful of sugar, one of melted butter or of
salad oil. Beat the eggs very light, and add the milk. Pour one-third of
this mixture on the flour, and beat until perfectly smooth and light;
then add the remainder and the other ingredients. Heat and butter an
omelet pan. Pour into it a thin layer of the mixture. When brown on one
side, turn, and brown the other. Roll up, sprinkle with sugar, and serve
hot. Or, cover with a thin layer of jelly, and roll. A number of them
should be served on one dish.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><big><a name="SALADS"></a> SALADS.</big></big></p>
<p>A salad should come to the table fresh and crisp. The garnishes
should be of the lightest and freshest kind. Nothing is more out of
place than a delicate salad covered with hard-boiled eggs, boiled beets,
etc. A salad with which the mayonnaise dressing is used, should have
only the delicate white leaves of the celery, or the small leaves from
the heart of the lettuce, and these should be arranged in a wreath at
the base, with a few tufts here and there on the salad. The contrast
between the creamy dressing and the light green is not great, but it is
pleasing. In arranging a salad on a dish, or in a bowl, handle it very
lightly. Never use pressure to get it into form. When a jelly border is
used with salads, some of it should be helped with the salad. The small
round radishes may be arranged in the dish with a lettuce salad. In
washing lettuce great care must be taken not to break or wilt it. The
large, dark green leaves are not nice for salad. As lettuce is not an
expensive vegetable, it is best, when the heads are not round and
compact, to buy an extra one and throw the large tough leaves away. In
winter and early spring, when lettuce is raised in hot-houses, it is
liable to have insects on it. Care must be taken that all are washed
off. Only the white, crisp parts of celery should be used in salads. The
green, tough parts will answer for stews and soups. Vegetable salads can
be served for tea and lunch and with, or after, the meats at dinner. The
hot cabbage, red cabbage, celery, cucumber and potato salads, are
particularly appropriate for serving with meats. The lettuce salad, with
the French dressing, and the dressed celery, are the best to serve after
the meats. A rich salad, like chicken, lobster or salmon, is out of
place at a company dinner. It is best served for suppers and lunches.
The success of a salad (after the dressing is made) depends upon keeping
the lettuce or celery crisp and not adding meat or dressing to it until
the time for serving.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Mayonnaise Dressing.</p>
<p>A table-spoonful of mustard, one of sugar, one-tenth of a
teaspoonful of cayenne, one teaspoonful of salt, the yolks of three
uncooked eggs, the juice of half a lemon, a quarter of a cupful of
vinegar, a pint of oil and a cupful of whipped cream. Beat the yolks and
dry ingredients, until they are very light and thick, with either a
silver or wooden spoon--or, better still, with a Dover beater of second
size. The bowl in which the dressing is made should be set in a pan of
ice water during the beating. Add a few drops of oil at a time until the
dressing becomes very <i>thick</i> and rather hard. After it has reached
this stage the oil can be added more rapidly. When it gets so thick that
the beater turns hard, add a little vinegar. When the last of the oil
and vinegar has been added it should be very thick. Now add the lemon
juice and whipped cream, and place on ice for a few hours, unless you
are ready to use it. The cream may be omitted without injury.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Salad Dressing Made at the Table.</p>
<p>The yolk of a raw egg, a table-spoonful of mixed mustard, one-fourth
of a teaspoonful of salt, six table-spoonfuls of oil. Stir the yolk,
mustard and salt together with a fork until they begin to thicken. Add
the oil, gradually, stirring all the while. More or less oil can be used.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Cream Salad Dressing.</p>
<p>Two eggs, three table-spoonfuls of vinegar, one of cream, one
teaspoonful of sugar, one-fourth of a teaspoonful of salt, one-fourth of
a teaspoonful of mustard. Beat two eggs well. Add the sugar, salt and
mustard, then the vinegar, and the cream. Place the bowl in a basin of
boiling water, and stir until about the thickness of rich cream. If the
bowl is thick and the water boils all the time, it will take about five
minutes. Cool, and use as needed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Red Mayonnaise Dressing.</p>
<p>Lobster "coral" is pounded to a powder, rubbed through a sieve, and
mixed with mayonnaise dressing. This gives a dressing of a bright color.
Or, the juice from boiled beets can be used instead of "coral."</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Green Mayonnaise Dressing.</p>
<p>Mix enough spinach green with mayonnaise sauce to give it a bright
green color. A little finely-chopped parsley can be added.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Aspic Mayonnaise Dressing.</p>
<p>Melt, but heat only slightly, one cupful of aspic jelly; or, one
cupful of consomm&eacute; will answer, if it is well jellied. Put in a
bowl and place in a basin of ice water. Have ready the juice of half a
lemon, one cupful of salad oil, one-fourth of a cupful of vinegar, one
table-spoonful of sugar, one scant table-spoonful of mustard, one
teaspoonful of salt and one-tenth of a teaspoonful of cayenne. Mix the
dry ingredients with the vinegar. Beat the jelly with a whisk, and as
soon as it begins to thicken, add the oil and vinegar, a little at a
time. Add the lemon juice the last thing. You must beat all the time
after the bowl is placed in the ice water. This gives a whiter dressing
than that made with the yolks of eggs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Boiled Salad Dressing.</p>
<p>Three eggs, one table-spoonful each of sugar, oil and salt a scant
table-spoonful of mustard, a cupful of milk and one of vinegar. Stir
oil, salt, mustard and sugar in a bowl until perfectly smooth. Add the
eggs, and beat well; then add the vinegar, and finally the milk. Place
the bowl in a basin of boiling water, and stir the dressing until it
thickens like soft custard. The time of cooking depends upon the
thickness of the bowl. If a common white bowl is used, and it is placed
in water that is boiling at the time and is kept constantly boiling,
from eight to ten minutes will suffice; but if the bowl is very thick,
from twelve to fifteen minutes will be needed. The dressing will keep
two weeks if bottled tightly and put in a cool place.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Sour Cream Salad Dressing. </span><br>
</p>
<p>One cupful of sour cream, one teaspoonful of salt, a speck of
cayenne, one table-spoonful of lemon juice, three of vinegar, one
teaspoonful of sugar. Mix all together thoroughly. This is best for
vegetables.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Sardine Dressing.</p>
<p>Pound in a mortar, until perfectly smooth, the yolks of four
hard-boiled eggs and three sardines, which have been freed of bones, if
there were any. Add the mixture to any of the thick dressings, like the
mayonnaise or the boiled. This dressing is for fish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Salad Dressing Without Oil.</p>
<p>The yolks of four uncooked eggs, one table-spoonful of salt, one
heaping teaspoonful of sugar, one heaping teaspoonful of mustard, half a
cupful of clarified chicken fat, a quarter of a cupful of vinegar, the
juice of half a lemon, a speck of cayenne. Make as directed for
mayonnaise dressing.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Salad Dressing made with Butter.</p>
<p>Four table-spoonfuls of butter, one of flour, one table-spoonful of
salt, one of sugar, one heaping teaspoonful of mustard, a speck of
cayenne, one cupful of milk, half a cupful of vinegar, three eggs. Let
the butter get hot in a sauce-pan. Add the flour, and stir until smooth,
being careful not to brown. Add the milk, and boil up. Place the
sauce-pan in another of hot water. Beat the eggs, salt, pepper, sugar
and mustard together, and add the vinegar. Stir this into the boiling
mixture, and stir until it thickens like soft custard, which will be in
about fire minutes. Set away to cool; and when cold, bottle, and place
in the ice-chest. This will keep two weeks.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Bacon Salad Dressing.</p>
<p>Two table-spoonfuls of bacon or pork fat, one of flour, one of lemon
juice, half a teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of sugar, one of
mustard, two eggs, half a cupful of water, half a cupful of vinegar.
Have the fat hot. Add the flour, and stir until smooth, but not brown.
Add the water, and boil up once. Place the sauce-pan in another of
boiling water. Have the eggs and seasoning beaten together. Add the
vinegar to the boiling mixture, and stir in the beaten egg. Cook four
minutes, stirring all the while. Cool and use. If corked tightly, this
will keep two weeks in a cold place.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> French Salad Dressing.</p>
<p>Three table-spoonfuls of oil, one of vinegar, one salt-spoonful of
salt, one-half a salt-spoonful of pepper. Put the salt and pepper in a
cup, and add one table-spoonful of the oil. When thoroughly mixed, add
the remainder of the oil and the vinegar. This is dressing enough for a
salad for six persons. If you like the flavor of onion, grate a little
juice into the dressing. The juice is obtained by first peeling the
onion, and then grating with a coarse grater, using a good deal of
pressure. Two strokes will give about two drops of juice--enough for
this rule.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chicken Salad.</p>
<p>Have cold roasted or boiled chicken free of skin, fat and bones.
Place on a board, and cut in long, thin strips, and cut these into dice.
Place in an earthen bowl (there should be two quarts), and season with
four table-spoonfuls of vinegar, two of oil, one teaspoonful of salt and
one-half of a teaspoonful of pepper. Set away in a cold place for two or
three hours. Scrape and wash enough of the tender white celery to make
one quart. Cut this, with a sharp knife, in pieces about half an inch
thick. Put these in the ice chest until serving time. Make the
mayonnaise dressing. Mix the chicken and celery together, and add half
of the dressing. Arrange in a salad bowl or on a flat dish, and pour the
remainder of the dressing over it. Garnish with white celery leaves. Or,
have a jelly border, and arrange the salad in this. Half celery and half
lettuce is often used for chicken salad. Many people, when preparing for
a large company, use turkey instead of chicken, there being so much more
meat in the same number of pounds of the raw material; but the salad is
not nearly so nice as with chicken. If, when the chicken or fowl is
cooked, it is allowed to cool in the water in which it is boiled, it
will be juicier and tenderer than if taken from the water as soon as
done.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Lobster Salad</span>.</p>
<p>Cut up and season the lobster the same as chicken. Break the leaves
from a head of lettuce, one by one, and wash them singly in a large pan
of cold water. Put them in a pan of ice water for about ten minutes, and
then shake in a wire basket, to free them of water. Place in the ice
chest until serving time. When ready to serve, put two or three leaves
together in the form of a shell, and arrange these shells on a flat
dish. Mix one-half of the mayonnaise dressing with the lobster. Put a
table-spoonful of this in each cluster of leaves. Finish with a
teaspoonful of the dressing on each spoonful of lobster. This is an
exceedingly inviting dish. Another method is to cut or tear the leaves
rather coarse, and mix with the lobster. Garnish the border of the dish
with whole leaves. There should be two-thirds lobster to one-third
lettuce.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Salmon Salad.</p>
<p>One quart of cooked salmon, two heads of lettuce, two
table-spoonfuls of lemon juice, one of vinegar, two of capers, one
teaspoonful of salt, one-third of a teaspoonful of pepper, one cupful of
mayonnaise dressing, or the French dressing. Break up the salmon with
two silver forks. Add to it the salt, pepper, vinegar and lemon juice.
Put in the ice chest or some other cold place, for two or three hours.
Prepare the lettuce as directed for lobster salad. At serving time, pick
out leaves enough to border the dish. Cut or tear the remainder in
pieces, and arrange these in the centre of a flat dish. On them heap the
salmon lightly, and cover with the dressing. Now sprinkle on the capers.
Arrange the whole leaves at the base, and, if you choose, lay one-fourth
of a thin slice of lemon on each leaf.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Oyster Salad.</p>
<p>One pint of celery, one quart of oysters, one-third of a cupful of
mayonnaise dressing, three table-spoonfuls of vinegar, one of oil, half
a teaspoonful of salt, one-eighth of a teaspoonful of pepper, one
table-spoonful of lemon juice. Let the oysters come to a boil in their
own liquor. Skim well and drain. Season them with the oil, salt, pepper,
vinegar and lemon juice. When cold, put in the ice chest for at least
two hours. Scrape and wash the whitest and tenderest part of the celery,
and, with a sharp knife, cut in <i>very</i> thin slices. Put in a bowl
with a large lump of ice, and set in the ice chest until serving time.
When ready to serve, drain the celery, and mix with the oysters and half
of the dressing. Arrange in the dish, pour the remainder of the dressing
over, and garnish with white celery leaves.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Sardine Salad.</p>
<p>Arrange one quart of any kind of cooked fish on a bed of crisp
lettuce. Split six sardines, and if there are any bones, remove them.
Cover the fish with the sardine dressing. Over this put the sardines,
having the ends meet in the centre of the dish. At the base, of the dish
mate a wreath of thin slices of lemon. Garnish with parsley or lettuce,
and serve immediately.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Shad Roe Salad.</p>
<p>Three shad roe, boiled in salted water twenty minutes. When cold,
cut in <i>thin</i> slices. Season and set away, the same as salmon.
Serve the same as salmon, except omit the capers, and use chopped
pickled beet.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Salads of Fish.</p>
<p>All kinds of cooked fish can be served in salads. Lettuce is the
best green salad to use with them, but all green vegetables, when cooked
and cold, can be added to the fish and dressing. The sardine and French
dressings are the best to use with fish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Polish Salad.</p>
<p>One quart of cold game or poultry, cut very fine; the French
dressing, four hard-boiled eggs, one large, or two small heads of
lettuce. Moisten the meat with the dressing, and let it stand in the ice
chest two or three hours. Rub the yolks of the eggs to a powder, and
chop the whites very fine. Wash the lettuce and put in the ice chest
until serving time. When ready to serve, put the lettuce leaves together
and cut in long, narrow strips with a <i>sharp</i> knife, or tear it
with a fork. Arrange on a dish, heap the meat in the centre, and
sprinkle the egg over all.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Beef Salad.</p>
<p>One quart of cold roasted or stewed beef--it must be very tender,
double the rule for French dressing, one table-spoonful of chopped
parsley, and one of onion juice, to be mixed with the dressing. Cut the
meat in <i>thin</i> slices, and then into little squares. Place a layer
in the salad bowl, sprinkle with parsley and dressing, and continue this
until all the meat is used. Garnish with parsley, and keep in a cold
place for one of two hours. Any kind of meat can be used instead of beef.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Meat and Potato Salad.</p>
<p>Prepare the meat as directed for beef salad, using, however,
one-half the quantity. Add one pint of cold boiled potatoes, cut in thin
slices, and dressing. Garnish, and set away as before. These salads can
be used as soon as made, but the flavor is improved by their standing an
hour or more.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Bouquet Salad.</p>
<p>Four hard-boiled eggs, finely chopped; one head of lettuce, or one
pint of water cresses; a large bunch of nasturtium blossoms or
buttercups, the French dressing, with the addition of one teaspoonful of
sugar. Wash the lettuce or cresses, and throw into ice water. When
crisp, take out, and shake out all the water. Cut or tear in pieces. Put
a layer in the bowl, with here and there a flower, and sprinkle in half
of the egg and half the dressing. Repeat this. Arrange the flowers in a
wreath, and put a few in the centre. Serve immediately.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Cauliflower Salad.</p>
<p>Boil one large cauliflower with two quarts of water and one
table-spoonful of salt, for half an hour. Take up and drain. When cold,
divide into small tufts. Arrange on the centre of a dish and garnish
with a border of strips of pickled beet. Pour cream dressing, or a
cupful of mayonnaise dressing, over the cauliflower. Arrange a star of
the pickled beet in the centre. Serve immediately.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Asparagus Salad.</p>
<p>Boil two bunches of asparagus with one quart of water and one
table-spoonful of salt, for twenty minutes. Take up and drain on a
sieve. When cold, cut off the tender points, and arrange diem on the
dish. Pour on cream salad dressing.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Asparagus and Salmon Salad.</p>
<p>Prepare the asparagus as before directed. Season a quart of cooked
salmon with one teaspoonful of salt, one-third of a teaspoonful of
pepper, three table-spoonfuls of oil, one of vinegar and two of lemon
juice. Let this stand in the ice chest at least two hours. Arrange the
salmon in the centre of the dish and the asparagus points around it.
Cover the fish with one cupful of mayonnaise dressing. Garnish the dish
with points of lemon. Green peas can be used instead of asparagus.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Cucumber Salad.</p>
<p>Cut about one inch off of the point of the cucumber, and pare. (The
bitter juice is in the point, and if this is not cut off before paring,
the knife carries the flavor all through the cucumber.) Cut in thin
slices, cover with cold water, and let stand half an hour. Drain, and
season with French dressing. If oil is not liked it can be omitted.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Tomato Salad.</p>
<p>Pare ripe tomatoes (which should be very cold), and cut in thin
slices. Arrange on a flat dish. Put one teaspoonful of mayonnaise
dressing in the centre of each slice. Place a delicate border of parsley
around the dish, and a sprig here and there between the slices of tomato.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Cabbage Salad.</p>
<p>One large head of cabbage, twelve eggs, two small cupfuls of sugar,
two teaspoonfuls of salt, one table-spoonful of melted butter, two
teaspoonfuls of mustard, one cupful of vinegar, or more, if you like.
Divide the cabbage into four pieces, and wash well in cold water. Take
off all the wilted leaves and cut out the tough, hard parts. Cut the
cabbage very fine with a <i>sharp</i> knife. Have the eggs boiled hard,
and ten of them chopped fine. Add these and the other ingredients to the
cabbage. Arrange on a dish and garnish with the two remaining eggs and
pickled beets.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Hot Cabbage Salad.</p>
<p>One quart of finely-shaved cabbage, two table-spoonfuls of bacon or
pork fat, two large slices of onion, minced <i>very fine</i>; one
teaspoonful of salt, one-fourth of a teaspoonful of pepper, half a
cupful of vinegar, one teaspoonful of sugar. Pry the onion in the fat
until it becomes yellow; then add the other ingredients. Pour the hot
mixture on the cabbage. Stir well, and serve at once. Lettuce can be
served in the same manner.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Vegetable Salad.</p>
<p>A spoonful of green parsley, chopped fine with a knife; six
potatoes, half of a small turnip, half of a carrot, one small beet. Cut
the potatoes in small slices, the beet a little finer, and the turnip
and carrot very fine. Mix all thoroughly. Sprinkle with a scant
teaspoonful of salt--unless the vegetables were salted in cooking, and
add the whole French dressing, or half a cupful of the boiled dressing.
Keep very cool until served.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Red Vegetable Salad</span>.</p>
<p>One pint of cold boiled potatoes, one pint of cold boiled beets, one
pint of uncooked red cabbage, six table-spoonfuls of oil, eight of red
vinegar (that in which beets have been pickled), two teaspoonfuls of
salt (unless the vegetables have been cooked in salted water), half a
teaspoonful of pepper. Cut the potatoes in <i>thin</i> slices and the
beets fine, and slice the cabbage as thin as possible. Mix all the
ingredients. Let stand in a cold place one hour; then serve. Red cabbage
and celery may be used together. Use the French dressing.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Potato Salad.</p>
<p>Ten potatoes, cut fine; the French dressing, with four or five drops
of onion juice in it, and one table-spoonful of chopped parsley.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Potato Salad, No. 2.</p>
<p>One quart of potatoes, two table-spoonfuls of grated onion, two of
chopped parsley, four of chopped beet and enough of any of the dressings
to make moist. The sardine is the best for this. Pare and cut the
potatoes in thin slices, while hot. Mix the other ingredients with them,
and put away in a cool place until serving time. This is better for
standing two or three hours.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Cooked Vegetables in Salad.</p>
<p>Nearly every kind of cooked vegetables can be served in salads. They
can be served separately or mixed. They must be cold and well drained
before the dressing is added. Any of the dressings given, except
sardine, can be used.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Dressed Celery.</p>
<p>Scrape and wash the celery. Let it stand in ice water twenty
minutes, and shake dry. With a sharp knife, cut it in pieces about an
inch long. Put in the ice chest until serving time; then moisten well
with mayonnaise dressing. Arrange in the salad bowl or on a flat dish.
Garnish with a border of white celery leaves or water-cresses. When
served on a flat dish, points of pickled beets, arranged around the
base, make an agreeable change.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Lettuce Salad.</p>
<p>Two small, or one large head of lettuce. Break off all the leaves
carefully, wash each separately, and throw into a pan of ice water,
where they should remain an hour. Put them in a wire basket or coarse
towel, and <i>shake</i> out all the water. Either cut the leaves with a
sharp knife, or tear them in large pieces. Mix the French dressing with
them, and serve immediately. Beets, cucumbers, tomatoes, cauliflower,
asparagus, etc., can each be served as a salad, with French or boiled
dressing. Cold potatoes, beef, mutton or lamb, cut fine, and finished
with either dressing, make a good salad.<br>

</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><big><a name="MEATSAUCES"></a> MEAT
AND FISH SAUCES.</big></big></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Brown Sauce.</p>
<p>One pound of round beef, one pound of veal cut from the lower part
of the leg; eight table-spoonfuls of butter, one onion, one large slice
of carrot, four cloves, a small piece of mace, five table-spoonfuls of
flour, salt and pepper to taste, four quarts of stock. Cut the meat in
small pieces. Rub three spoonfuls of the butter on the bottom of a large
stew-pan. Put in the meat, and cook half an hour, stirring frequently.
Add the vegetables, spice, a bouquet of sweet herbs and one quart of the
stock. Simmer this two hours, and add the remainder of the stock. Half a
dozen mushrooms will improve the flavor greatly. Put the remainder of
the butter in a frying-pan, and when hot, add the flour. Stir until dark
brown, and as soon as it begins to boil, add to the sauce. Simmer one
hour longer. Season with salt and pepper, and strain through a fine
French sieve or gravy strainer. Skim off the fat, and the sauce is ready
to use. This will keep a week in winter. It is the foundation for an
fine dark sauces, and will well repay for the trouble and expense of
making.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> White Sauce.</p>
<p>Make the white sauce the same as the brown, but use all veal and
white stock. When the butter and flour are cooked together be careful
that they do not get browned.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> White Sauce, No. 2.</p>
<p>One quart of milk, four table-spoonfuls of butter, four of flour, a
small slice of onion, two sprigs of parsley, salt and pepper to taste.
Put the milk, onion and parsley on in the double boiler. Mix the butter
and flour together until smooth and light. When the milk boils, stir
four table-spoonfuls of it into the butter and flour, and when this is
well mixed, stir it into the boiling milk. Cook eight minutes. Strain,
and serve. This sauce is best with fish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> White Sauce, No. 3.</p>
<p>One large slice of onion, one small slice of carrot, a clove, a
small piece of mace, twelve pepper-corns, two table-spoonfuls of flour,
two heaping table-spoonfuls of butter, one quart of cream--not very
rich, salt to taste. Cook the spice and vegetables slowly in the butter
for twenty minutes. Add the flour, and stir until smooth, being careful
not to brown. Add the cream, gradually, stirring all the while. Boil for
two minutes. Strain, and serve. This sauce is good for veal and chicken
cutlets, <i>quenelles</i>, sweetbreads, etc.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> White Sauce, No. 4.</p>
<p>One pint of milk, one of cream, four table-spoonfuls of flour, the
yolks of two eggs, salt and pepper to taste. Put the milk and cream on
in the double boiler, reserving one cupful of the milk. Pour eight
table-spoonfuls of the milk on the flour, stir until perfectly smooth,
and add the remainder of the milk. Stir this into the other milk when it
boils. Stir the sauce for two minutes; then cover, and cook eight
minutes longer. Season well with salt and pepper. Beat the yolks of the
eggs with four spoonfuls of cream or milk. Stir into the sauce, and
remove from the fire immediately. The eggs may be omitted, if you
choose. One table-spoonful of chopped parsley stirred into the sauce
just before taking from the fire, is an improvement. This sauce is nice
for all kinds of boiled fish, but particularly for boiled salt fish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Bechamel Sauce.</p>
<p>One pint of white sauce, one pint of rich cream, salt, pepper. Let
the sauce and cream come to a boil separately. Mix them together, and
boil up once. Strain, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Cream Bechamel Sauce.</p>
<p>Three table-spoonfuls of butter, three scant ones of flour, ten
pepper-corns, a small piece of mace, half an onion, a large slice of
carrot, two cupfuls of white stock, one of cream, salt, a little nutmeg,
two sprigs of parsley, one of thyme and one bay leaf. Tie the parsley,
bay leaf and thyme together. Rub the butter and flour to a smooth paste.
Put all the ingredients, except the cream, in a stew-pan, and simmer
half an hour, stirring frequently; add the cream, and boil up once.
Strain, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Allemande Sauce.</p>
<p>One pint of white sauce, the yolks of six eggs, the juice of half a
lemon, one table-spoonful of mushroom ketchup, one table-spoonful of
butter, half a cupful of cream, salt, pepper, a grating of nutmeg. Let
the sauce come to a boil. Place the sauce-pan in another of boiling
water, and add all the seasoning except the lemon. Beat the yolks of
eggs and the cream together, and add to the sauce. Stir three minutes.
Take off, add the lemon juice, and strain.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Cream Sauce.</p>
<p>One pint of cream, one generous table-spoonful of flour, and salt
and pepper to taste. Let the cream come to a boil. Have the flour mixed
smooth with half a cupful of cold cream, reserved from the pint, and
stir it into the boiling cream. Add seasoning, and boil three minutes.
This sauce is good for delicate meats, fish and vegetables, and to pour
around croquettes and baked and Quaker omelets.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Cream Sauce, No. 2.</p>
<p>One cupful of milk, a teaspoonful of flour and a table-spoonful of
butter, salt and pepper. Put the butter in a small frying-pan, and when
hot, <i>but not brown,</i> add the flour. Stir until smooth; then
gradually add the milk. Let it boil up once. Season to taste with salt
and pepper, and serve. This is nice to cut cold potatoes into and let
them just heat through. They are then creamed potatoes. It also answers
as a sauce for other vegetables, omelets, fish and sweetbreads, or,
indeed, for anything that requires a white sauce. If you have plenty of
cream, use it, and omit the butter.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Polish Sauce.</p>
<p>One pint of stock, two table-spoonfuls of butter, four of grated
horseradish, one of flour, one of chopped parsley, the juice of one
lemon, one teaspoonful of sugar, salt, pepper. Cook the butter and flour
together until smooth, but not brown. Add the stock; and when it boils,
add all the other ingredients except the parsley. Boil up once, and add
the parsley. This sauce is for roast veal.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Robert Sauce.</p>
<p>Two cupfuls of stock, two small onions, four table-spoonfuls of
butter, one heaping table-spoonful of flour, one tea-spoonful of dry
mustard, one of sugar, a speck of cayenne, two table-spoonfuls of
vinegar, salt. Cut the onions into dice, and put on with the butter.
Stir until they begin to color; then add the flour, and stir until
brown. As soon as it boils, add the stock and other ingredients, and
simmer five minutes. Skim, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Supreme Sauce.</p>
<p>Add to one pint of white sauce three finely-chopped mushrooms, the
juice of half a lemon and one table-spoonful of butter. Simmer all
together ten minutes. Rub through the strainer and use.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Olive Sauce.</p>
<p>Two dozen queen olives, one pint of rich stock, the juice of one
lemon, two table-spoonfuls of salad oil, one of flour, salt, pepper, a
small slice of onion. Let the olives stand in hot water half an hour, to
extract the salt. Put the onion and oil in the stew-pan, and as soon as
the onion begins to color, add the flour. Stir until smooth, and add the
stock. Set back where it will simmer. Pare the olives, round and round,
close to the stones, and have the pulp in a single piece. If this is
done carefully with a sharp knife, in somewhat the same way that an
apple skin is removed whole, the olives will still have their natural
shape after the stones are taken out. Put them in the sauce, add the
seasoning, and simmer twenty minutes. Skim carefully, and serve. If the
sauce is liked thin, half the amount of flour given can be used. This
sauce is for roast ducks and other game.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Flemish Sauce.</p>
<p>Cut a cupful of the red part of a carrot into <i>very small</i>
dice. Cover with boiling water, and simmer one hour. Put three
table-spoonfuls of butter, two of flour, a slice of carrot, an onion,
cut fine; a blade of mace and twenty pepper-corns in a sauce-pan. Stir
over the fire one minute, and add two cupfuls of stock. Simmer gently
half an hour. Add a cupful of cream, boil up once, and strain. Now add
the cooked carrot, one table-spoonful of chopped parsley, two of chopped
cucumber pickles and, if you like, one of grated horseradish. Taste to
see if salt enough.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chestnut Sauce.</p>
<p>One pint of shelled chestnuts, one quart of stock, one teaspoonful
of lemon juice, one table-spoonful of flour, two of butter, salt,
pepper. Boil the chestnuts in water for about three minutes; then plunge
them into cold water, and rub off the dark skins. Put them on to cook
with the stock, and boil gently until they will mash readily (it will
take about an hour). Mash as fine as possible. Put the butter and flour
in a sauce-pan and cook until a dark brown. Stir into the sauce, and
cook two minutes. Add the seasoning, and rub all through a sieve. This
sauce is for roast turkey. When, to be served with boiled turkey, use
only a pint and a half of stock; rub the butter and flour together, and
stir into the boiling mixture; rub through the sieve as before; add half
a pint of cream to the sauce; return to the fire, boil up once, and
serve. The chestnuts used are twice as large as the native fruit All
first-class provision dealers and grocers keep them.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Celery Sauce.</p>
<p>Cut the tender parts of a head of celery <i>very fine.</i> Pour on
water enough to cover them, and no more. Cover the sauce-pan, and set
where it will simmer one hour. Mix together two table-spoonfuls of flour
and four of butter. When the celery has been boiling one hour, add to it
the butter and flour, one pint of milk or cream, and salt and pepper.
Boil up once, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Brown Mushroom Sauce.</p>
<p>One forty-cent can of French mushrooms, two cupfuls of stock, two
table-spoonfuls of flour, four of butter, salt, pepper. Melt the butter.
Add the flour, and stir until a very dark brown; then gradually add the
stock. When this boils up, add the liquor from the mushrooms. Season,
and simmer twenty minutes. Skim off any fat that may rise to the top.
Add the mushrooms, and simmer five minutes longer. Too much cooking
toughens the mushrooms. This sauce is to be served with any kind of
roasted, broiled or braised meats. It is especially nice with beef.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Brown Mushroom Sauce, No, 3.</p>
<p>One pint of stock, two cloves, one small slice each of turnip,
carrot and onion, three table-spoonfuls of butter, two of flour, half a
can of mushrooms, or one-eighth of a pound of the fresh vegetable. Cut
the vegetables in small pieces, and fry in the butter with the cloves
until brown. Add the flour, and stir until dark brown; then gradually
add the stock. Chop the mushrooms, stir into the sauce, and simmer half
an hour. Rub through the sieve. Use the same as the other brown mushroom
sauce.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> White Mushroom Sauce.</p>
<p>Hake a mushroom sauce like the first, using one cupful of white
stock and one cupful of cream, and cooking the butter only until smooth.
Do not let it become browned.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Beurre Noir.</p>
<p>Two table-spoonfuls of butter, one of vinegar, one of chopped
parsley, one teaspoonful of lemon juice, half a tea-spoonful of salt,
one quarter of a teaspoonful of pepper. Put the butter in a frying-pan,
and when very hot, add the parsley and then the other ingredients. Boil
up once. This sauce is for fried and broiled fish, and it is poured over
the fish before sending to the table.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Maitre d' Hotel Butter.</p>
<p>Four table-spoonfuls of butter, one of vinegar, one of lemon juice,
half a teaspoonful of salt, one quarter of a teaspoonful of pepper, one
teaspoonful of chopped parsley. Beat the butter to a cream, and
gradually beat in the seasoning. This sauce is spread on fried and
broiled meats and fish instead of butter. It is particularly nice for
fish and beefsteak.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Ma&icirc;tre d' H&ocirc;tel Sauce.</p>
<p>One pint of white stock, the yolks of three eggs, one heaping
table-spoonful of corn-starch. Put the stock on to boil, reserving
one-third of a cupful for the corn-starch. Mix the corn-starch with the
cold stock and stir into the boiling. Boil gently for five minutes.
Prepare the <i>ma&icirc;tre d' hotel</i> butter as directed in the rule,
and add to it the yolks of the eggs. Gradually stir into this the
boiling mixture. After placing the sauce-pan in another of boiling
water, stir constantly for three minutes. Take off, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Hollandaise Sauce.</p>
<p>Half a tea-cupful of butter, the juice of half a lemon, the yolks of
two eggs, a speck of cayenne, half a cupful of boiling water, half a
teaspoonful of salt. Beat the butter to a cream; then add the yolks, one
by one, the lemon juice, pepper and salt. Place the bowl in which these
are mixed in a sauce-pan of boiling water. Beat with an egg-beater until
the sauce begins to thicken (about a minute), and add the boiling water,
beating all the time. When like a soft custard it is done. The bowl, if
thin, must be kept over the fire only about five minutes, provided the
water boils all the time. The sauce should be poured around meat or fish
when it is on the dish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Lobster Sauce.</p>
<p>One small lobster, four table-spoonfuls of butter, two of flour,
one-fifth of a teaspoonful of cayenne, two table-spoonfuls of lemon
juice, one pint of boiling water. Cut the meat into dice. Pound the
"coral" with one table-spoonful of the butter. Rub the flour and the
remainder of the butter to a smooth paste. Add the water, pounded
"coral" and butter, and the seasoning. Simmer five minutes, and then
strain on the lobster. Boil up once, and serve. This sauce is for all
kinds of boiled fish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Butter Sauce.</p>
<p>Two table-spoonfuls of flour, half a cupful of butter and one pint
of boiling water. Work the flour and butter together until light and
creamy, and gradually add the boiling water. Stir constantly until it
comes to a boil, but do not let it boil. Take from the fire, and serve.
A table-spoonful of lemon juice and a speck of cayenne may be added if
you choose. A table-spoonful of chopped parsley also gives an agreeable
change.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> White Oyster Sauce.</p>
<p>One pint of oysters, three table-spoonfuls of butter, one heaping
table-spoonful of flour, one of lemon juice, salt, pepper, a speck of
cayenne. Wash the oysters in enough water, with the addition of the
oyster liquor, to make a pint. Work the butter and flour to a smooth
paste. Let the water and oyster juice come to a boil. Skim, and pour on
the flour and butter. Let come to a boil, and add the oysters and
seasoning. Boil up once, and serve. Half a cupful of the water may be
omitted and half a cupful of boiling cream added at the last moment.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Brown Oyster Sauce.</p>
<p>The same ingredients as for the white sauce. Put the butter and
flour in the sauce-pan and stir until a dark brown. Add the skimmed
liquor, boil up, and add the other ingredients. Boil up once more, and
serve. In the brown sauce stock can be used instead of water. The sauce
is served with broiled or stewed beefsteak.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Shrimp Sauce.</p>
<p>Make a butter sauce, and add to it two table-spoonfuls of essence of
anchovy and half a pint of canned shrimp. Stir well, and it is ready to
serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Anchovy Sauce.</p>
<p>Make the butter sauce, and stir into it four table-spoonfuls of
essence of anchovy and one of lemon juice.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Egg Sauce.</p>
<p>Six hard-boiled eggs, chopped fine with a silver, knife or spoon;
half a cupful of boiling cream or milk, and the butter sauce. Make the
sauce, add the boiling cream or milk, and then the eggs. Stir well, and
serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Fine Herbs Sauce.</p>
<p>One table-spoonful of chopped onion, two of chopped mushroom, one of
chopped parsley, two of butter, salt, pepper, one pint of white sauce,
No. 3. Put the butter and chopped ingredients in a sauce-pan and stir
for one minute over the fire. Add the sauce, and boil up once.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Caper Sauce.</p>
<p>Make a butter sauce, and stir into it one table-spoonful of lemon
juice, two of capers, and one of essence of anchovy.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Mustard Sauce.</p>
<p>Stir three table-spoonfuls of mixed mustard and a speck of cayenne
into a butter sauce. This is nice for devilled turkey and broiled smoked
herrings.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Curry Sauce.</p>
<p>One table-spoonful of butter, one of flour, one teaspoonful of curry
powder, one large slice of onion, one large cupful of stock, salt and
pepper to taste. Cut the onion fine, and fry brown in the butter.. Add
the flour and curry powder. Stir for one minute, add the stock, and
season with the salt and pepper. Simmer five minutes; then strain, and
serve. This sauce can be served with a broil or <i>saut&eacute;</i> of
meat or fish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Vinaigrette Sauce.</p>
<p>One teaspoonful of white pepper, one of salt, half a teaspoonful of
mustard, half a cupful of vinegar, one table-spoonful of oil. Mix the
salt, pepper and mustard together; then <i>very</i> slowly add the
vinegar, and after mixing well, add the oil. The sauce is to be eaten on
cold meats or on fish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Piquant Sauce.</p>
<p>Two cupfuls of brown sauce, one of consomme, (common stock will do),
four table-spoonfuls of vinegar, two of chopped onion, two of chopped
capers, two of chopped cucumber pickles, one-fourth of a teaspoonful of
cayenne, one teaspoonful of sugar, salt to taste. Cook the onion and
vinegar in a sauce-pan for three minutes; then add the sauce, consomme,
sugar, salt and pepper. Boil rapidly for five minutes, stirring all the
while. Add the capers and pickles, and boil three minutes longer.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Tomato Sauce.</p>
<p>One quart of canned tomatoes, two table-spoonfuls of butter, two of
flour, eight cloves and a small slice of onion. Cook the tomato, onion
and cloves ten minutes. Heat the butter in a small frying-pan, and add
the flour. Stir over the fire until smooth and brown, and then stir into
the tomatoes. Cook two minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper,
and rub through a strainer fine enough to keep back the seeds. This
sauce is nice for fish, meat and macaroni.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Tartare Sauce.</p>
<p>The yolks of two uncooked eggs, half a cupful of oil, three
table-spoonfuls of vinegar, one of mustard, one teaspoonful of sugar,
one-quarter of a teaspoonful of pepper, one teaspoonful of salt, one of
onion juice, one table-spoonful of chopped capers, one of chopped
cucumber pickles. Make the same as mayonnaise dressing. Add the chopped
ingredients the last thing. This sauce can be used with fried and
broiled meats and fish, and with meats served in jelly.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Champagne Sauce.</p>
<p>Mix thoroughly a table-spoonful of butter with one of flour. Set the
sauce-pan on the fire, and stir constantly until the mixture is dark
brown; then pour into it half a pint of boiling gravy (the liquor in
which pieces of lean meat have boiled until it is very rich). Pour in
this gravy slowly, and stir slowly and continually. Let boil up once,
season well with pepper and salt, and strain. Add half a cupful of
champagne, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Port Wine Sauce for Game.</p>
<p>Half a tumbler of currant jelly, half a tumbler of port wine, half a
tumbler of stock, half a teaspoonful of salt, two table-spoonfuls of
lemon juice, four cloves, a speck of cayenne. Simmer the cloves and
stock together for half an hour. Strain on the other ingredients, and
let all melt together. Part of the gravy from the game may be added to
it.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Currant Jelly Sauce.</p>
<p>Three table-spoonfuls of butter, one onion, one bay leaf, one sprig
of celery, two table-spoonfuls of vinegar, half a cupful of currant
jelly, one table-spoonful of flour, one pint of stock, salt, pepper.
Cook the butter and onion until the latter begins to color. Add the
flour and herbs. Stir until brown; add the stock, and simmer twenty
minutes. Strain, and skim off all the fat. Add the jelly, and stir over
the fire until it is melted. Serve with game.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Bread Sauce for Game.</p>
<p>Two cupfuls of milk, one of dried bread crumbs, a quarter of an
onion, two table-spoonfuls of butter, and salt and pepper. Dry the bread
in a warm oven, and roll into rather coarse crumbs. Sift; and put the
fine crumbs which come through, and which make about one-third of a
cupful, on to boil with the milk and onion. Boil ten or fifteen minutes,
and add a table-spoonful of butter and the seasoning. Skim out the
onion. Fry the coarse, crumbs a light brown in the remaining butter,
which must be very hot before they are put in. Stir over a hot fire two
minutes, being watchful not to burn. Cover the breasts of the roasted
birds with these, and serve the sauce poured around the birds, or in a
gravy dish.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><big><a name="FORCEMEAT"></a>
FORCE-MEAT AND GARNISHES.</big></big></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Force-Meat for Game.</p>
<p>One pound of clear uncooked veal, a quarter of a pound of fat pork,
one pound of boiled ham, one quart of milk, one pint of bread crumbs,
half a cupful of butter, three table-spoonfuls of onion juice, one
table-spoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of pepper, six mushrooms, the
yolks of four eggs, a speck each of clove, cinnamon, mace and nutmeg.
Chop the veal, pork, ham and mushrooms <i>very fine</i>, and, with a
pestle, pound to a powder. Cook the bread and milk together, stirring
often, until the former is soft and smooth. Set away to cool, first
adding the butter and seasoning to it. When cold, add to the powdered
meat. Mix thoroughly, and rub through a sieve. Add the yolks of the
eggs. This force-meat is used for borders in which to serve hot entrees
of game. It is also used in game pies, and sometimes for <i>quenelles.</i>
When used for a border it is put in a well-buttered mould and steamed
three hours. It is then turned out on a flat dish, and the hot salmis,
blanquette or ragout is poured into the centre.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Ham Force-Meat.</p>
<p>Two pounds of cooked ham, chopped, and then pounded very fine; one
pound of bread crumbs, one pint of milk, the yolks of four eggs, one
table-spoonful of mixed mustard, one teaspoonful of salt, a speck of
cayenne, one cupful of brown sauce. Make as directed for force-meat for
game.</p>
<p><big> Veal Force-Meat.</big></p>
<p>Three pounds of veal, one cupful of butter, one pint of bread
crumbs, one pint of milk, one pint of white sauce, two table-spoonfuls
of salt, half a teaspoonful of pepper, two table-spoonfuls of Halford
sauce, two of onion juice, the yolks of six eggs, half a teaspoonful of
grated nutmeg, two table-spoonfuls of chopped parsley. Make and use the
same as game force-meat.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chicken Force-Meat.</p>
<p>Use only the breast of the chicken. Make the same as veal
force-meat, using cream, however, with the bread crumbs, instead of
milk. This force-meat is for the most delicate entries only. Either the
chicken or veal can be formed into balls about the size of a walnut and
fried or poached for soups.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Fish Force-Meat.</p>
<p>This can be made the same as veal force-meat. Salmon and halibut
will be found the best kinds of fish to use for it. The force-meat is
for entrees of fish.</p>
<p> Force-meat is sometimes formed into a square or oval piece for the
centre of the dish. It should be about an inch and a half thick. Place
on a buttered sheet or plate and steam two hours. When cooked, slip on
to the centre of the dish. Arrange the entree on this, and pour the
sauce around the base. Delicate cutlets, sweetbreads, etc., can be used
here. Veal or chicken force-meat is the best for all light entrees.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Jelly Border.</p>
<p>Make one quart of aspic jelly. Set the plain border mould (see rice
border, under Entries) in a pan with a little ice and water. Pour enough
of the liquid jelly into the mould to make a layer half an inch deep.
Let this get hard. When hard, decorate with cooked carrot and beet, and
the white of a hard-boiled egg. These must all be cut in pretty shapes
with the vegetable cutter, and arranged on the jelly. Very carefully add
two table-spoonfuls of jelly, and let it harden. Fill with the remainder
of the jelly, and set away to harden. At serving time put the mould for
half a minute in a pan of warm water. Wipe it, and turn the jelly on a
cold flat dish. Fill the centre with salad, boned fowl, or anything else
you choose.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Marinade for Fish.</p>
<p>One quart of cider, two slices of carrot, one large onion, four
cloves, a bouquet of sweet herbs, two table-spoonfuls of butter, two of
salt, half a teaspoonful of pepper and the same quantity of mustard.
Cook the onion and carrot in the butter for ten minutes, and add the
other ingredients. Cover the sauce-pan, and simmer one hour and a half.
This is for stewing fish. It should be strained on the fish, and that
should simmer forty minutes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Cold Marinade.</p>
<p>A bouquet of sweet herbs, the juice of half a lemon, two
table-spoonfuls of oil, six of vinegar, one of onion juice, a speck of
cayenne, one teaspoonful of salt, one-fourth of a teaspoonful of pepper,
one-tenth of a teaspoonful of ground clove. Mix all together. Sprinkle
on the meat or fish, which should stand ten or twelve hours. This is
particularly for fish, chops, steaks and cutlets which are to be either
fried or broiled. Any of the flavorings that are not liked may be
omitted. When cooked meats or fish are sprinkled with salt, pepper and
vinegar, as for salads, they are said to be marinated.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> To Get Onion Juice.</p>
<p>Feel the onion, and grate on a large grater, using a good deal of
pressure.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> To Fry Parsley.</p>
<p>Wash the parsley, and wipe dry. Put in the frying basket and plunge
into boiling fat for half a minute.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> To Make Spinach Green.</p>
<p>Wash a peck of spinach. Pour on it two quarts of boiling water. Let
it stand one minute. Pour off the water, and pound the spinach to a soft
pulp. Put this in a coarse towel and squeeze all the juice into a small
frying-pan. (Two people, by using the towel at the same time, will
extract the juice more thoroughly than one can.) Put the pan on the
fire, and stir until the juice is in the form of curd and whey. Turn
this on a sieve, and when all the liquor has been drained off, scrape
the dry material from the sieve, and put away for use. Another mode is
to put with the juice in the frying-pan three table-spoonfuls of sugar.
Let this cook five minutes; then bottle for use. This is really the more
convenient way. Spinach green is used for coloring soups, sauces and
creams.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Points of Lemon.</p>
<p>Cut fresh lemons in thin slices, and divide these slices into four
parts. This gives the points. They are used as a garnish for salads and
made dishes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> To Make a Bouquet of Sweet Herbs.</p>
<p>Put two sprigs of parsley on the table, and across them lay two bay
leaves, two sprigs of thyme, two of summer savory, and two <i>leaves</i>
of sage. Tie all the other herbs (which are dry) with the parsley. The
bouquet is for soups, stews, game, and meat jellies. When it can be
obtained, use tarragon also.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><big><a name="VEGETABLES"></a>
VEGETABLES.</big></big></p>
<p>All green vegetables must be washed thoroughly in cold water and
dropped into water which has been salted and is just beginning to boil
There should be a table-spoonful of salt for every two quarts of water.
If the water boils a long time before the vegetables are put in it loses
all its gases, and the mineral ingredients are deposited on the bottom
and sides of the kettle, so that the water is flat and tasteless: the
vegetables will not look green, nor have a fine flavor. The time of
boiling green vegetables depends very much upon the age, and how long
they have been gathered. The younger and more freshly gathered, the more
quickly they are cooked. The following is a time-table for cooking:<br>

<p>Nearly all these vegetables are eaten dressed with salt, pepper and
butter, but sometimes a small piece of lean pork is boiled with them,
and seasons them sufficiently.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Potatoes.</p>
<p>No other vegetable is in America so commonly used and abused. The
most inexperienced housekeeper takes it as a matter of course that she
or her cook cannot fail of boiling potatoes properly. The time of
cooking the potato, unlike that of nearly all other vegetables, does not
vary with age or freshness; so there need never be a failure. In baking,
the heat of the oven is not always the same, and the time of cooking
will vary accordingly. The potato is composed largely of starch. Cooking
breaks the cells and sets this starch free. If the potato is removed
from heat and moisture as soon as this occurs, it will be dry and mealy,
but if it is allowed to boil or bake, even for a few minutes, the starch
will absorb the moisture, and the potato will become soggy and have a
poor flavor.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Boiled Potatoes.</p>
<p>Twelve medium-sized potatoes, one table-spoonful of salt, boiling
water to cover. Pare the potatoes, and if old, let them stand in cold
water an hour or two, to freshen them. Boil fifteen minutes; then add
the salt, and boil fifteen minutes longer. Pour off <i>every drop</i> of
water. Take the cover from the sauce-pan and shake the potatoes in a
current of cold air (at either the door or window). Place the saucepan
on the back part of the stove, and cover with a clean coarse towel until
serving time. The sooner the potatoes are served, the better. This rule
will ensure perfectly sweet and mealy potatoes, if they were good and
ripe at first.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Mashed Potatoes.</p>
<p>Twelve potatoes, one and a half table-spoonfuls of salt, one
table-spoonful of butter, half a cupful of boiling milk. Pare and boil
as directed for boiled potatoes, and mash fine and light. Add the salt
and butter. Beat well; then add the milk, and beat as you would for
cake. This will give a light and delicate dish of potatoes. The potatoes
must be perfectly smooth before adding the other ingredients.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Pur&eacute;e of Potato.</p>
<p>Prepare the potatoes as directed for mashed potatoes, except use a
generous cupful of milk and half a teaspoonful of pepper. If the puree
is to serve as a foundation for dry meats, like grouse, veal or turkey,
use a cupful of rich stock instead of the milk. This preparation, spread
on a hot platter, with any kind of cold meat or fish that has been
warmed in a little sauce or gravy, heaped in the centre of it, makes a
delightful dish for lunch or dinner.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Potato Puffs.</p>
<p>Prepare the potatoes as directed for mashed potato. While <i>hot,</i>
shape in balls about the size of an egg. Have a tin sheet well buttered,
and place the balls on it. As soon as all are done, brash over with
beaten egg. Brown in the oven. When done, slip a knife under them and
slide them upon a hot platter. Garnish with parsley, and serve
immediately.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Riced Potato.</p>
<p>Have a flat dish and the colander hot. With a spoon, rub mashed
potato through the colander on to the hot dish. Be careful that the
colander does not touch the potato on the dish. It is best to have only
a few spoonfuls of the potato in it at one time. When all has been
pressed through, place the dish in the oven for five minutes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Potato &agrave; la Royale.</p>
<p>One pint of hot toiled potatoes, a generous half cupful of cream or
milk, two table spoonfuls of butter, the whites of four eggs and yolk of
one, salt and pepper to taste. Beat the potato very light and fine. Add
the seasoning, milk and butter, and lastly the whites of the eggs,
beaten to a stiff froth. Turn into a buttered escalop dish. Smooth with
a knife and brush over with the yolk of the egg, which has been well
beaten. Brown quickly, and serve. It will take ten minutes to brown. The
dish in which it is baked should hold a little more than a quart.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Potatoes &agrave; l'Italienne.</p>
<p>Prepare the potatoes as for serving <i>&agrave; la royale</i>. Add
one table-spoonful of onion juice, one of finely-chopped parsley, and
half a cupful of finely-chopped cooked ham. Heap lightly in the dish,
but do not smooth. Sprinkle on this one table-spoonful of grated
Parmesan cheese. Brown quickly, and serve. The cheese may be omitted if
not liked.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Thin Fried Potatoes.</p>
<p>Pare and cut raw potatoes <i>very thin</i>, with either the
vegetable slicer or a sharp knife. Put them in cold water and let them
stand in a cold place (the ice chest is best) from ten to twenty-four
hours. This draws out the starch. Drain them well. Put about one pint in
the frying basket, plunge into boiling lard, and cook about ten minutes.
After the first minute set back where the heat will decrease. Drain, and
dredge with salt. Continue this until all are fried. Remember that the
fat must be hot at first, and when it has regained its heat after the
potatoes have been added, must be set back where the potatoes will not
cook fast. If the cooking is too rapid they will be brown before they
have become crisp. Care must also be taken, when the potatoes are first
put in the frying kettle, that the fat does not boil over. Have a fork
under the handle of the basket, and if you find that there is danger,
lift the basket partly out of the kettle. Continue this until all the
water has evaporated; then let the basket remain in the kettle. If many
potatoes are cooked in this way for a family, quite an amount of starch
can be saved from the water in which they were soaked by pouring off the
water and scraping the starch from the bottom of the vessel. Dry, and
use as any other starch.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> French Fried Potatoes.</p>
<p>Pare small uncooked potatoes. Divide them in halves, and each half
in three pieces. Put in the frying basket and cook in boiling fat for
ten minutes. Drain, and dredge with salt. Serve hot with chops or
beefsteak. Two dozen pieces can be fried at one time.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Potatoes &agrave; la Parisienne.</p>
<p>Pare large uncooked potatoes. Cut little balls out of these with the
vegetable scoop. Six balls can be cut from one large potato. Drop them
in ice water. When all are prepared, drain them, and put in the frying
basket. This can be half full each time--that is, about three dozen
balls can be put in. Put the basket carefully into the fat, the same as
for thin fried potatoes. Cook ten minutes. Drain. Dredge with salt, and
serve very hot. These are nice to serve with a fillet of beef,
beefsteak, chops or game. They may be arranged on the dish with the
meats, or served in a separate dish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Potato Balls Fried in Butter.</p>
<p>Cut little balls from cooked potatoes with the vegetable scoop.
After all the salt has been washed from one cupful of butter (chicken
fat will do instead), put this in a small frying-pan. When hot, put in
as many potato balls as will cover the bottom, and fry until a golden
brown. Take up, drain, and dredge with salt. Serve very hot. These balls
can be cut from raw potatoes, boiled in salted water five minutes, and
fried in the butter ten minutes. When boiled potatoes are used, the part
left after the balls have been cut out, will answer for creamed or
Lyonnaise potatoes; but when raw potatoes are used, the part left should
be put into cold water until cooking time, and can be used for mashed or
riced potatoes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Potatoes Baked with Roast Beef.</p>
<p>Fare rather small potatoes, and boil for twelve minutes in salted
water. Take up and put on the grate with roast beef. Bake twenty-five or
thirty minutes. Arrange on the dish with the beef, or, if you prefer, on
a separate dish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Broiled Potatoes.</p>
<p>Cut cold boiled potatoes in slices a third of an inch thick. Dip
them in melted butter and <i>fine</i> bread crumbs. Place in the double
broiler and broil over a fire that is not too hot. Garnish with parsley,

<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Sweet Potatoes.</p>
<p>Sweet potatoes require from forty-five to fifty-five minutes to
boil, and from one hour to one and a quarter to bake. The time given
will make the potatoes moist and sweet If, however, they are preferred
dry and mealy, fifteen minutes less will be enough.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> French Fried Sweet Potatoes.</p>
<p>Prepare and fry the same as the white potatoes. Or, they can first
be boiled half an hour, and then pared, cut and fried as directed. The

stand one hour. Drain, and pepper the slices slightly, and dip in beaten
egg and bread crumbs (two eggs and a pint of crumbs for a good-sized
plant). Fry in boiling fat for eight or ten minutes. The slices will be
soft and moist when done. Or, the slices can be seasoned with pepper,
and fried in just enough pork fat to brown them. The egg plant is
sometimes stewed, and sometimes baked, but there is no other mode so
good as frying.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Boiled Rice.</p>
<p>One cupful of rice, one quart of boiling water, one scant
table-spoonful of salt. Wash the rice in three waters, and put in the
double kettle with the salt and boiling water. Boil rapidly fifteen
minutes; then pour off <i>all</i> the water. Cover tightly, return to

about five minutes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> New Bedford Corn Pudding.</p>
<p>Twelve ears of corn, four eggs, a generous pint and a half of milk,
a generous teaspoonful of salt, four table-spoonfuls of sugar. Grate the
corn, beat the eggs with a spoon, and mix all the ingredients together.
Butter a deep earthen dish, and pour the mixture into it. Bake slowly

milk. If very young and milky, one pint of milk will be sufficient.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Pickled Beets.</p>
<p>Cut boiled beets in slices. Lay these in a large glass jar or
earthen pot. For every beet, put in one slice of onion, one
table-spoonful of grated horse-radish, six cloves, and vinegar enough to
cover. The beets will be ready to use in ten or twelve hours. They will
not keep more than a week.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Baked Beans.</p>

cold water over night. In the morning pour off the water. Cover with hot
water, put two pounds of corned beef with them, and boil until they
begin to split open, (the time depends upon the age of the beans, but it
will be from thirty to sixty minutes). Turn them into the colander, and
pour over them two or three quarts of cold water. Put about half of the
beans in a deep earthen pot, then put in the beef, and finally the
remainder of the beans. Mix one tea-spoonful of mustard and one
table-spoonful of molasses with a little water. Pour this over the
beans, and then add boiling water to just cover. Bake <i>slowly</i> ten
hours. Add a little water occasionally.<br>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><big><a name="PIES"></a> PIES AND
PUDDINGS.</big></big></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Puff Paste.</p>
<p>One quart of pastry flour, one pint of butter, one table-spoonful of
salt, one of sugar, one and a quarter cupfuls of ice water. Wash the
hands with soap and water, and dip them first in very hot, and then in
cold, water. Rinse a large bowl or pan with boiling water and then with
cold. Half fill it with cold water. Wash the butter in this, working it
with the hands until it is light and waxy. This frees it of the salt and
butter-milk, and lightens it, so that the pastry is more delicate. Shape
the butter into two thin cakes, and put in a pan of ice water, to
harden. Mix the salt and sugar with the flour. With the hands, rub
one-third of the butter into the flour. Add the water, stirring with a
knife. Stir quickly and vigorously until the paste is a smooth ball.
Sprinkle the board <i>lightly</i> with flour. Turn the paste on this,
and pound quickly and lightly with the rolling pin. Do not break the
paste. Roll from you and to one side; or, if easier to roll from you all
the while, turn the paste around. When it is about one-fourth of an inch
thick, wipe the remaining butter, break it in bits, and spread these on
the paste. Sprinkle lightly with flour. Fold the paste, one-third from
each side, so that the edges meet. Now fold from the ends, but do not
have these meet. Double the paste, pound lightly, and roll down to about
one-third of an inch in thickness. Fold as before, and roll down again.
Repeat this three times if for pies, and six times if for <i>vol-au-vents</i>,
patties, tarts, etc. Place on the ice, to harden, when it has been
rolled the last time. It should be in the ice chest at least an hour
before being used. In hot weather if the paste sticks when being rolled
down, put it on a tin sheet and place on ice. As soon as it is chilled
it will roll easily. The less flour you use in rolling out the paste the
tenderer it will be. No matter how carefully every part of the work may
be done, the paste will not be good if much flour is used.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chopped Paste.</p>
<p>One quart of pastry flour, two cupfuls of unwashed butter, one
teaspoonful of salt, one table-spoonful of sugar, and a scant cupful of
ice water. Put the flour, salt, sugar and butter in the chopping-tray.
Chop all together until the butter is thoroughly mixed with the flour;
then add the water, and continue chopping. When well mixed, sprinkle the
board with flour, turn the paste on it, and roll into a flat piece.
Place in a pan on the ice. When hard, use the same as puff paste. It can
be used as soon as mixed, but will not, of course, be so nice.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> French Paste for Raised Pies.</p>
<p>One quart of pastry flour, one table-spoonful of sugar, one
teaspoonful of salt, one scant cupful of butter, one egg, one tea-cupful
of water. Rub the butter, salt and sugar into the flour. Beat the egg,
and add the water to it. Stir this into the flour and butter. Stir this
mixture until it is a smooth paste; then put on the board and roll the
same as puff paste. This paste must be rolled eight times.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> To Make a Pie.</p>
<p>Butter the pie plate (tin is the best), and cover with paste that
has been rolled very thin. Roll a strip of paste long enough to go
around the plate, and cut in strips an inch wide. Wet the edge of the
plate with water, and put a strip of paste on it. Fill with any kind of
prepared fruit Have the paste in a roll, and cut enough from the end to
cover the pie. Sprinkle the board lightly with flour, and place the
paste up-on it. Flour the rolling pin with, the hand. Roll from you and
to one side until the paste is the right size. It must be much larger
than the plate. In the centre cut a slit about halt an inch long. Cover
the pie, having the paste "<i>fulled</i>" on, as it shrinks in the
baking. The oven must be hot at first, and after the first fifteen
minutes the drafts must be closed. A mince pie will require one hour to
bake, and an apple pie fifty minutes. Peach, and nearly all other fruit
pies, require the same time.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Mince Pie Meat.</p>
<p>Boil a beef tongue, weighing six pounds, and six pounds of the vein
of a round of beef (these should just simmer). After skinning the
tongue, chop it and the beef very fine, and add five pounds of beef
suet, chopped fine; five pounds of stoned raisins, three of dried
currants, one and a half of citron, cut fine; nine of sugar, one and a
half pints of molasses, two quarts of the liquor in which the meat was
boiled, one quart of brandy, one pint of white wine, a cupful of salt,
half a cupful of cinnamon, one-fourth of a cupful of cloves, one-fourth
of a cupful of allspice, three nutmegs, a table-spoonful of mace. Put
all in a large pan, and let stand over night. Put what you wish to bake
in another pan with half as much stewed and sweetened apple as you have
meat, and let it stand one hour. Put the remainder of the meat in a jar.
Cover with a paper dipped in brandy, and then cover tightly, to exclude
the air. Set in a cool place for future use, [Mrs. M. L. W.]</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Squash pies.</p>
<p>Five pints of stewed and strained squash, two quarts of boiling
milk, one and a half nutmegs, four teaspoonfuls of salt, five cupfuls of
sugar, nine eggs, four table-spoonfuls of Sicily Madeira and two of
rose-water. Gradually pour the boiling milk on the squash, and stir
continually. Add the nutmeg, rose-water and sugar. When cold, add the
eggs, well beaten; and just before the mixture is put in the plates, add
the Madeira. Butter deep plates, and line with a plain paste. Fill with
the mixture, and bake in a moderate oven for forty minutes. [Mrs. M. L.
W.]</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Sweet Potato Pies.</p>
<p>When the potatoes are dry and mealy, take a quart after they have
been pared, boiled and mashed, a quart of milk, four eggs, salt, nutmeg,
cinnamon and sugar to taste. Bake the same as squash pies. If the
potatoes are very moist, use less milk.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Lemon Pie.</p>
<p>The juice and rind of one lemon, two eggs, eight heaping
table-spoonfuls of sugar, one small tea-cupful of milk, one teaspoonful
of corn-starch. Mix the corn-starch with a little of the milk. Put the
remainder on the fire, and when boiling, stir in the corn-starch. Boil
one minute. Let this cool, and add the yolks of the eggs, four heaping

<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Royal Diplomatic Pudding.</p>
<p>Soak half a box of gelatine in half a cupful of cold water one or
two hours. Pour on this two-thirds of a pint of boiling water, and add
the juice of a lemon, a cupful of sugar and half a pint of wine. Stir,
and strain. Have two moulds, one holding two quarts, the other a quart.
Put a layer of jelly in the large mould, and place on ice. When hard,
garnish with candied cherries, cut in two. Pour in a few spoonfuls of
liquid jelly, <i>not hot,</i> to hold the cherries, and then pour in
enough to cover them. When the jelly is perfectly hard, set the small
mould in the centre of the large one, and fill the space between with
jelly. Fill the small mould with ice, and set both in a basin of ice
water. When the jelly is again hard, remove the ice from the small
mould, which fill with warm water, and lift it out carefully. The vacant
space is to be filled with custard made by the following recipe: The
yolks of five eggs, half a cupful of sugar, two table-spoonfuls of wine,
one teaspoonful of vanilla extract, half a box of gelatine, soaked in
half a cupful of cold water, a scant cupful of milk. Put the milk to
boil. Add the gelatine, and the eggs and sugar, beaten together. Strain,
and add the wine and vanilla. When the custard begins to thicken, add
half a pint of cream, whipped to a stiff froth. Pour the custard into
the space mentioned, and let it stand until it hardens. Turn the pudding
out of the mould, and serve with soft custard poured around it.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Orange Diplomatic Pudding.</p>
<p>Make one quart of orange jelly. Arrange this in the mould and make a
filling the same as for royal diplomatic pudding. Flavor the filling,
and the custard for the sauce, with orange.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Lemon Diplomatic Pudding.</p>
<p>Make one quart of lemon jelly, and prepare the mould with it the
same as for the royal diplomatic pudding. Make a lemon sponge, with
which fill the cavity. When hard, serve with a custard flavored with
lemon.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Bird's Nest Pudding.</p>
<p>Half a package of Cox's sparkling gelatine, six oranges, three
cupfuls and a half of sugar, one pint of blanc-mange. Take the peel from
the oranges in quarters. Put it in two quarts of water, and let it stand
over night. In the morning drain off the water. Cut the peel in thin
strips with the scissors. Put it in cold water and boil until tender.
Make a syrup of half a cupful of sugar and a pint of water. Drain the
straws of orange peel on a sieve. Put them in this syrup and simmer half
an hour. Turn into a bowl, and let stand until next day. Put one pint of
sugar and one pint of water on to boil. Cook rapidly for twenty minutes;
the syrup will then fall from the spoon in threads. Put the straws in
this and boil half an hour. Take out, and drain on a sieve. As they dry,
put them in a dish, which place in the warm oven. These are for the
nests. For the jelly, soak the gelatine two hours in half a cupful of
cold water; then pour on it enough boiling water to make, with the
juice of the oranges, two cupfuls and a half. Add one small cupful of
sugar and the orange juice. Stir well, and strain through a napkin into
a shallow dish. In one end of each of six eggs make a hole, about the
size of a cent Break the yolks with a skewer, and pour the eggs into a
bowl. (They may be used for puddings and custards.) Wash and drain the
shells. Fill them with the blanc-mange. Have a pan filled with meal, in
which to stand the shells. Set away to cool. Break the jelly in pieces
with a fork, and put in a flat glass dish. Arrange the straws in the
form of nests, six in number, and arrange them on the jelly. Place the
eggs in these, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Quince Iced Pudding.</p>
<p>Beat three eggs very light; then add one cupful and a half of
powdered sugar, and beat until foamy. Put two cupfuls of sifted pastry
flour in the sieve, and add one teaspoonful of cream of tarter and half
a teaspoonful of soda. Stir half a cupful of cold water into the beaten
eggs and sugar; then sift the flour on this. Mix quickly and thoroughly.
Have a tin mould similar to the border moulds shown in the chapter on
Kitchen Furnishing, but of oval shape, higher and plain. It should be
about four inches high, and six wide and eight long, top
measurement--the mould tapering. The space between the outer and inner
walls should be an inch and a half. Butter this mould and pour the cake
mixture into it. Bake slowly for forty-five minutes. Let it stand in the
mould until nearly cold. Turn on a flat dish. Put the whites of two eggs
in a bowl, gradually beat into them one cupful and a half of powdered
sugar, and season with half a teaspoonful of vanilla extract Ice the
cake with this, and set away to dry. In the meantime, make a cream with
one generous quart of cream, one cupful of sugar, one table-spoonful of
vanilla and one pint of soft custard. Freeze the same as ice cream.
Spread the inside of the cake with a large tumbler of quince jelly. At
serving time pack the frozen cream in the centre of the cake. Heap
whipped cream on the top and at the base, and serve immediately. This is
an elegant pudding, and is not difficult to make.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Princess Pudding.</p>
<p>Soak for an hour in a pint of cold water one box of Cox's sparkling
gelatine, and add one pint of boiling water, one pint of wine, the juice
of four lemons, and three large cupfuls of sugar. Beat the whites of
four eggs to a stiff froth, and stir into the jelly when it begins to
thicken. Pour into a large mould, and set in ice water in a cool place.
When ready to serve, turn out as you would jelly, only have the pudding
in a deep dish. Pour one quart of soft custard around it, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Apple Porcupine.</p>
<p>Sixteen large apples, two large cupfuls of granulated sugar, one
lemon, one quart of water, one tea-cupful of powdered sugar, one quart
of milk, one table-spoonful of corn-starch, half a teaspoonful of salt,
six eggs, one pint of blanched almonds. Put the water and granulated
sugar in a sauce-pan. Have ten of the apples pared and cored, and as
soon as the sugar and water boils, put in as many of the apples as will
cook without crowding. Simmer gently until the fruit is cooked through.
When done on one side the fruit must be turned. Drain, and cool them on
a dish. Cook ten apples in this manner. Have the six that remain pared
and quartered and stewed in one cupful of water. Turn the stewed apples
into the syrup left from cooking the others. Add the grated rind and the
juice of the lemon. Simmer until a smooth marmalade is formed. It will
take about twenty minutes. Set away to cool. Put the milk on in the
double boiler, reserving half a cupful. When it boils, stir in the
corn-starch, which has been mixed with the cold milk. Stir well, and
cook five minutes. Beat the yolks of the six eggs and the whites of two
with half of the powdered sugar. Gradually pour the boiling mixture on
this. Return to the boiler and cook three minutes, stirring all the
time. Add the salt. Turn into a pitcher or bowl, and set away to cool.
Heap the cooked apples in a mound, using the marmalade to fill up the
spaces between the apples. Beat the four whites of eggs to a stiff
froth, and beat the half cupful of powdered sugar into it. Cover the
apples with this, and stick the almonds into it. Brown slowly in the
oven. Set away to cool. At serving time, season the custard with lemon,
and pour it around the porcupine.</p>

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="14SAUCES"></a> SAUCES.</span></big></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Rich Wine Sauce.</p>
<p>One cupful of butter, two of powdered sugar, half a cupful of wine.
Beat the butter to a cream. Add the sugar gradually, and when very
light, add the wine, which has been made hot, a little at a time. Place
the bowl in a basin of hot water and stir for two minutes. The sauce
should be smooth and foamy.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Creamy Sauce.</p>
<p>Half a cupful of butter, one cupful of <i>powdered</i> sugar,
one-fourth of a cupful of cream or milk, four table-spoonfuls of wine,
or one teaspoonful of vanilla or lemon extract. If lemon or vanilla is
used, add four table-spoonfuls of cream. Beat the butter to a cream. Add
the sugar, gradually, beating all the while. When light and creamy,
gradually add the wine, and then the cream, a little at a time. When all
is beaten smooth, place the bowl in a basin of hot water and stir until
the sauce is smooth and creamy--no longer. It will take only a few
minutes. This is a delicious sauce, and if well beaten, and not kept in
the hot water long enough to melt the sugar, it will be white and foamy
all through.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Foaming Sauce.</p>
<p>One cupful of butter, two of powdered sugar, the whites of two eggs,
five table-spoonfuls of wine or three of brandy, one-fourth of a
tea-cupful of <i>boiling</i> water. Beat the butter to a cream, and
gradually beat the sugar into it. Add the whites of the eggs, unbeaten,
one at a time, and then the brandy or wine. When all is a light, smooth
mass, add the water, beating in a little at a time. Place the bowl in a
basin of hot water and stir until smooth and frothy, which will be about
two minutes. This sauce is for rich puddings.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> German Sauce.</p>
<p>One cupful of sugar, half a cupful of water, three eggs, one
table-spoonful of butter, three of brandy, or a teaspoonful of any
extract you like. Put the sugar and water in a sauce-pan and boil for
fifteen minutes. Beat the yolks of the eggs, and stir them into the
boiling syrup. Put the basin in another of hot water and beat the
mixture with the whisk until it begins to thicken; then add the butter,
the whites of the eggs, beaten to a stiff froth, and the brandy. Stir
one minute longer, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> German Sauce, No. 2.</p>
<p>The yolks of five and whites of three eggs, one cupful of powdered
sugar, one pint of cream, and any flavor you choose. Beat together the
yolks of the eggs and the sugar, and add the cream. Put this mixture in
the double boiler (having first beaten the whites to a stiff froth), and
stir until it begins to thicken; then add the whites and seasoning. Beat
thoroughly, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Lemon Sauce.</p>
<p>One cupful of sugar, half a cupful of water, the rind and juice of
two lemons, the yolks of three eggs. Boil together the sugar, water,
lemon juice and grated rind for twenty minutes. Beat the yolks of the
eggs. Put the basin containing the boiling syrup in another of boiling
water. Stir the yolks of the eggs into this, and beat rapidly for three
minutes. Take up the sauce-pan and continue the beating for five
minutes; then serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Cream Sauce.</p>
<p>One cupful of powdered sugar, one egg, two cupfuls of whipped cream.
Beat the white of the egg to a stiff froth. Add the yolk and sugar, and
beat well. Flavor with vanilla, lemon or wine, and add the cream last of
all. This sauce is excellent for a light pudding.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Vanilla Sauce.</p>
<p>The whites of two eggs and the yolk of one, half a cupful of
powdered sugar, one teaspoonful of vanilla, three table-spoonfuls of
milk. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, next beat in the
sugar, and then the yolk of the egg and the seasoning. Serve
immediately. This sauce is for light puddings.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Molasses Sauce.</p>
<p>One cupful of molasses, half a cupful of water, one table-spoonful
of butter, a little cinnamon or nutmeg (about half a teaspoonful),
one-fourth of a teaspoonful of salt, three table-spoonfuls of vinegar.
Boil all together for twenty minutes. The juice of a lemon can be used
instead of the vinegar. This sauce is nice for apple or rice puddings.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Caramel Sauce.</p>
<p>Put one cupful of sugar in a small frying-pan and stir on the fire
until a dark brown, if you like a strong caramel flavor, or till a light
brown, if you like a delicate flavor. Add a cupful of boiling water, and
simmer fifteen minutes. Set away to cool.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Quince Sauce.</p>
<p>One cupful of quince preserve, one of milk, one table-spoonful of
corn-starch, half a cupful of sugar. Mix the corn-starch with a little
of the cold milk, and put the remainder in the double boiler. When it
boils, stir in the corn-starch, and cook ten minutes; then add the sugar
and the preserve, mashed fine. Cook ten minutes longer and rub through a
strainer. This sauce is usually served cold, but when used with hot
pudding, it too should be hot.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Apricot Sauce.</p>
<p>One cupful of canned apricot, one of sugar, one of milk, one
table-spoonful of corn-starch, half a cupful of water. Put the milk in
the double boiler. Mix the corn-starch with a few spoonfuls of cold
milk, and stir into the boiling milk. Cook ten minutes. Boil the sugar
and water together for twenty minutes. Rub the apricot through a sieve,
and stir it into the syrup. Beat well, and then beat in the boiled milk
and corn-starch. Place the sauce-pan in a dish of cold water and stir
for about eight minutes. Set away to cool. If you have cream, use it
instead of the milk. All kinds of fruit can be used in pudding sauces by
following this rule. If the fruit is preserved, use less sugar; and if
very acid, use more.</p>
<p>If it is necessary to make the wine, creamy or foamy sauce any
considerable time before dinner, do not add the hot water or hot wine,
and do not place the bowl in hot water, until serving time. The vanilla
and cream sauces are spoiled by standing after being made.<br>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><big> <a name="DESSERT"></a>DESSERT.</big></big></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Blanc-Mange Made with Sea Moss Farina.</p>
<p>One quart of milk, one level table-spoonful of sea moss farina, half
a teaspoonful of salt, three table-spoonfuls of sugar, one teaspoonful
of flavor. Put the milk in the double boiler and sprinkle the farina
into it, stirring all the while. Let this heat slowly. Stir often. When
it boils up, and looks white, add the sugar, salt and flavor. Strain,
and turn into a mould that has been dipped in cold water. Set away to
harden. It will take about three hours for this. The blanc-mange is
ready to use as soon as cold.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Blanc-Mange Made with Gelatine.</p>
<p>One package of gelatine, three pints of milk, four table-spoonfuls
of sugar, half a teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of extract of
vanilla or of lemon. Put the gelatine with the milk and let it stand in
a cold place for two hours; then put it in the double boiler, and heat
quickly. Do not let it boil. Stir often; and as soon as the gelatine is
melted, take off, and add the sugar, salt and flavor. Strain, and
partially cool, before putting into the moulds. It should stand six
hours before serving, and it is even better, especially in summer, to
make it the day before using.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Blanc-Mange Made with Isinglass.</p>
<p>One quart of milk, three and a half sheets of Cooper's isinglass,
half a teaspoonful of salt, three table-spoonfuls of sugar and a
four-inch piece of stick cinnamon. Break up the isinglass, put it and
the cinnamon with the milk, and let stand in a cold place two hours;
then put it in the double boiler and let it come, gradually, to the
boiling point. It must not boil. Stir often while heating. As soon as
the isinglass is dissolved, take from the fire, and add the salt and
sugar. Strain into a tin basin, which place in a pan of cold water. Stir
occasionally while cooling. When nearly cold, turn into a mould and
place in the ice chest. It can be poured into the mould as soon as
strained, but the cream will rise to the top in that case, unless the
mixture is stirred carefully in the centre of the mould. The sheets of
isinglass vary in thickness, so that it is best to take part of die
thick sheets and part of the thin.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chocolate "Blanc"-Mange.</p>
<p>One package of gelatine, four table-spoonfuls of sugar, one (ounce)
square of Baker's chocolate, three pints of milk. Soak the gelatine two
hours in the milk, and then put it in the double boiler. Scrape the
chocolate fine and put it in a small frying-pan with two spoonfuls of
the sugar and two of boiling water. Stir this over a <i>hot</i> fire
until smooth and glossy (it will take about a minute), and stir into the
milk. Add the remainder of the sugar, and strain. Turn into moulds, and
set away to harden. This dish should be made at least eight hours before
being used. If you please, you can add a teaspoonful of vanilla extract.
By adding the chocolate to any of the preparations for blanc-mange while
they are hot, you have a chocolate "blanc"-mange.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Cream &agrave; la Versailles.</p>
<p>One quart of milk, half a cupful of sugar, half a teaspoonful of
vanilla extract, half a teaspoonful of salt, seven eggs, two
table-spoonfuls of water. Put the sugar in a small frying-pan and stir
until a very light brown. Add the water, stir a moment longer, and mix
with the milk. Beat the eggs and salt with a spoon. Add this mixture and
the vanilla to the milk. Butter a two-quart charlotte russe mould
lightly, and put the custard in it Put the mould in a basin of warm (not
hot) water and bake slowly until the custard is firm in the centre. It
should take forty minutes; but if the oven is quite hot, it will be done
in thirty minutes. Test by putting a knife down into the centre, for if
the custard is not milky, it is done. Set away in a cold place until
serving time. It must be ice cold when eaten. Turn out on a flat dish,
and pour caramel sauce over it.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Royal Cream.</p>
<p>One quart of milk, one-third of a box of gelatine, four
table-spoonfuls of sugar, three eggs, vanilla flavor. Put the gelatine
in the milk, and let it stand for half an hour. Beat the yolks well with
sugar, and stir into the milk. Set the kettle in a pan of hot water and
stir until the mixture begins to thicken like soft custard. Have ready
the whites of the eggs, beaten to a stiff froth; and the moment the
kettle is taken from the fire, stir them in, quickly, and turn into the
moulds. Set away in a cold place to harden.</p>
<p>When you cannot get cream, to make charlotte russe, this is a good
filling, if you omit the whites of eggs, and fill the moulds when the
cream is perfectly cold, but not hardened.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Lemon Sponge.</p>
<p>The juice of four lemons, four eggs, one cupful of sugar, half a
package of gelatine, one generous pint of cold water. Soak the gelatine
two hours in half a cupful of the water. Squeeze the lemons, and strain
the juice on the sugar. Beat the yolks of the eggs and mix them with the
remainder of the water. Add the sugar and lemon to this, and cook in the
double boiler until it begins to thicken; then add the gelatine. Strain
this mixture into a tin basin, which place in a pan of ice water. Beat
with the whisk occasionally, until it has cooled, but not hardened. Now
add the unbeaten whites of the eggs, and beat all the time until the
mixture begins to thicken. Let it thicken almost to the point where it
cannot be poured, and then turn into a mould and set away to harden.
Remember that the whites of the eggs must be added as soon as the
mixture cools, which should be in about six or eight minutes, and that
the mixture must be beaten until it begins to harden. The hardening is
rapid after it once begins, so that it will be necessary to have the
moulds all ready. The sponge will not be smooth and delicate if not
poured into the moulds. If for any reason you should get the mixture too
hard before pouring, place the basin in another of hot water, and let
the sponge melt a little; then beat it up again. Serve with powdered
sugar and cream.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Orange Sponge.</p>
<p>Make orange sponge the same as lemon, using a small pint of water
and the juice of six large oranges.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Peach Sponge.</p>

of five eggs, one scant cupful of sugar, one and a half cupfuls of
water. Soak the gelatine for two hours in half a cupful of the water.
Boil the cupful of water, and the sugar fifteen minutes. Hash the
peaches fine, rub through a sieve, and put in the syrup. Cook five
minutes, stirring all the time. Place the sauce-pan in another of
boiling water and add the gelatine. Stir for five or eight minutes, to
dissolve the gelatine; then place the sauce-pan in a dish of ice water
and beat the syrup until it begins to cool. Add the whites of the eggs,
and beat until the mixture begins to harden. When it will just pour,
turn it into the mould, and set away to harden. Serve with sugar and
cream. Apricot and pear sponges can be made in the same manner.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Strawberry Sponge.</p>
<p>One quart of strawberries, half a package of gelatine, one cupful
and a half of water, one cupful of sugar, the juice of a lemon, the
whites of four eggs. Soak the gelatine two hours in half a cupful of the
water. Mash the strawberries, and add half the sugar to them. Boil the
remainder of the sugar and the cupful of water gently twenty minutes.
Rub the strawberries through a sieve. Add the gelatine to the boiling
syrup and take from the fire immediately; then add the strawberries.
Place in a pan of ice water and beat five minutes. Add the whites of
eggs and beat until the mixture begins to thicken. Pour into the moulds
and set away to harden. Serve with sugar and cream. Raspberry and
blackberry sponges are made in the same way.</p>

in a sauce-pan with the sugar and the remainder of the water. Simmer ten
minutes. Add the gelatine, take from the fire immediately, and strain
into a tin basin. When partially cooled, add the whites of the eggs, and
beat until the mixture begins to thicken. Pour into a mould and set away
to harden. Serve with soft custard flavored with wine.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Strawberry Bavarian Cream.</p>
<p>One quart of strawberries, one pint of cream, one large cupful of
sugar, half a cupful of boiling water, half a cupful of cold water. Soak
the gelatine two hours in the cold water. Mash the berries and sugar
together, and let them stand one hour. Whip the cream to a froth. Strain
the juice from the berries, pressing through as much as possible without
the seeds. Pour the hot water on the gelatine, and when dissolved,
strain it into the strawberry juice. Place the basin (which should be
tin) in a pan of ice water and beat until the cream begins to thicken.
When as thick as soft custard, stir in the whipped cream; and when this
is well mixed, turn into the mould (it will make nearly two quarts), and
set away to harden. Serve with whipped cream heaped around it, or, if
the border mould is used, have the cream in the centre.</p>
<p>Raspberry and blackberry Bavarian creams are made the same as the
strawberry.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Orange Bavarian Cream.</p>
<p>A pint and a half of cream, the juice of five oranges and grated
rind of two, one large cupful of sugar, the yolks of six eggs, half a
package of gelatine, half a cupful of cold water. Soak the gelatine two

gelatine, Squeeze and strain the orange juice, and add the sugar to it.
Put the unwhipped cream in the double boiler. Beat the yolks of the eggs
and add to the milk. Stir this mixture until it begins to thicken, and
add the gelatine. As soon as the gelatine is dissolved, take off, and
place in a pan of ice water. Stir until it begins to cool (about two
minutes), and add the orange juice and sugar. Beat about as thick as
soft custard, and add the whipped cream. Stir until well mixed, and pour
into the moulds. Set away to harden. There will be about two quarts.
Serve with whipped cream heaped around the orange cream.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Peach Bavarian Cream.</p>

cream, half a box of gelatine, half a cupful of cold water. Mash the
peaches and rub them and the juice through a sieve. Add the sugar. Soak
the gelatine two hours in the cold water. Whip the cream to a froth. Put
the peaches in a sauce-pan and let them simmer twenty minutes. Stir
often. Add the gelatine to the hot peaches and remove from the fire
immediately. Place the sauce-pan in a pan of ice water and beat until
the mixture begins to thicken; then stir in the cream. Mix thoroughly,
and pour into the mould. Set away to harden. Serve with whipped cream.

<p>Four the mixture that is to be frozen into the tin can, put the
beater in this, and put on the cover. Place in the tub, being careful to
have the point on the bottom fit into the socket in the tub. Put on the
cross-piece, and turn the crank to see if everything is in the right
place. Next comes the packing. Ice should be broken in large pieces, and
put in a canvas bag, and pounded fine with a mallet. Put a thick layer
of it in the tub (about five inches deep), and then a thin layer of
salt. Continue this until the tub is full, and pack down solid with a
paddle or a common piece of wood. After turning the crank a few times
add more salt and ice, and again pack down. Continue in this way until
the tub is full. For a gallon can, three pints of salt and perhaps ten
quarts of fine ice will be required. Remember that if the freezer is
packed solid at first, no more ice or salt is needed. The water must
never be let off, as it is one of the strongest elements to help the
freezing. If more salt than the quantity given is used, the cream will
freeze sooner, but it will not be so smooth and rich as when less is
used.</p>
<p>Turn the crank for twenty minutes--not fast at first, but very
rapidly the last ten minutes. It will be hard to torn when the mixture
is frozen. Turn back the cross-piece, wipe the salt and ice from the
cover, and take off the cover, not displacing the can itself. Remove the
beater and scrape the cream from it. Work a large spoon up and down in
the cream until it is light and the space left by taking out the beater
is filled. Cover the can, cork up the hole from which the handle of the
beater was taken, put on the cross piece, and set the tub in a cool
place until serving time. Then dip the can for a few seconds in water
that is a trifle warm, wipe it, and turn on the dish. Rest it for a
moment, and lift a little.</p>
<p>If the cream is to be served from a mould, remove it when you do the
beater. Fill the mould and work the cream up and down with a spoon. This
will press the cream into every part, and lighten it. Cover the top of
the mould with thick white paper, put on the tin cover, and bury in
fresh ice and salt.</p>
<p>There are a great many good freezers. The Packer is especially
suited to family use. It turns so easily that any lady can make her own
creams. For the first twelve minutes a child can work it. It is made of
the best stock, and will last many years. The cogs on freezers should be
oiled occasionally. When you have made cream, see that every part of the
freezer is clean and perfectly dry before putting away.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Vanilla Ice Cream.</p>
<p>The foundation given in this rule is suitable for all kinds of ice
cream. One generous pint of milk, one cupful of sugar, half a cupful of
flour, <i>scant</i>; two eggs, one quart of cream, one table-spoonful
of vanilla extract, and when the cream is added, another tea-cupful of
sugar. Let the milk come to a boil. Beat the first cupful of sugar, the

pint of water and a scant pint of sugar. Simmer gently for thirty
minutes. Rub through a sieve, add the cream, gradually, and freeze.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Strawberry Ice Cream.</p>
<p>One quart of cream, one quart of strawberries, one pint of sugar.
Mash the sugar and strawberries together, and let them stand one or two
hours. Add the cream, rub through a strainer into the freezer, and

when half frozen, the whole berries be stirred in.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Strawberry Ice Cream &agrave; la Surprise.</p>
<p>Put three pints of strawberries in a deep dish with one cupful of
sugar. Season three pints of cream with a cupful and a half of sugar and
two table-spoonfuls of wine. Freeze this. Take out the beater and draw
the frozen cream to the sides of the freezer. Fill the space in the
centre with the strawberries and sugar, which cover with the frozen
cream. Put on the cover and set away for an hour or more. When the cream
is turned out, garnish the base, if you please, with strawberries.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Raspberry Ice Cream.</p>
<p>Make raspberry ice cream the same as strawberry, using a little less
sugar.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Apricot Ice Cream.</p>
<p>One quart of cream, one generous pint of canned apricot, one pint of
sugar, the yolks of three eggs, one pint of water. Boil the sugar and
water together twenty minutes. Rub the apricot through a sieve and add
it to the boiling syrup; add also the beaten yolks of the eggs, and cook
for six minutes, stirring all the while. Take from the fire and place in
a pan of cold water. Beat the mixture ten minutes. If cold at the end of
that time, add the cream, and freeze.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Peach Ice Cream.</p>
<p>Peach ice cream can be made like the apricot, having the pint of
peaches a very generous one.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Banana Ice Cream.</p>
<p>Make this the same as the apricot, using, however, only one cupful
and a half of sugar, and six bananas. More bananas can be used if a
strong flavor of the fruit is liked.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chocolate Ice Cream.</p>
<p>Make a foundation with two eggs, one cupful of sugar, half a cupful
of flour and a pint of milk, the same as for vanilla ice cream. While
this is cooking, scrape one square (an ounce) of Baker's chocolate, and
add to it two table-spoonfuls of sugar and one of boiling water. Stir
this over the fire until perfectly smooth and glossy, and add it to the
boiling mixture. This quantity gives a very delicate flavor. If a
stronger one is wished use two squares of the chocolate. Put the mixture
in cold water to cool. Stir occasionally. When cold, add one tea-cupful
of sugar and one quart of milk. Freeze.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Brown Bread Ice Cream.</p>

and three table-spoonfuls of wine to the cream, and freeze.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Coffee Ice Cream.</p>
<p>Make the same as vanilla, with the addition of one cupful of strong
coffee. This gives a strong flavor. Less can be used. The second cupful
of sugar should be large.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Caramel Ice Cream.</p>
<p>Make the hot mixture, as for vanilla. Put the small cupful of sugar
in a small frying-pan and stir over the fire until the sugar turns
liquid and begins to smoke. Turn into the boiling mixture, and put away
to cool. When cold, add one quart of cream. Strain the mixture into the
freezer, and freeze. The flavor of this cream can be varied by browning
the sugar more or less.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Almond Ice Cream.</p>
<p>This is made the same as vanilla, except that one teaspoonful of
extract of bitter almond is used for flavoring.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Almond Ice Cream, No. 2.</p>
<p>One pint of blanched almonds, the yolks of five eggs, one quart of
cream, one and a half cupfuls of sugar, one pint of milk, one pint of
water. Boil the water and sugar together for twenty-five minutes. Put

fine in a mortar; one pint of milk, one quart of cream, two small
cupfuls of sugar, four eggs, one-fourth of a teaspoonful of salt. Beat
the eggs with one cupful of sugar. Put them and the milk in the double
boiler, and stir constantly until the mixture begins to thicken; then
add the salt, and put away to cool. When cold, add the cream and nut
meat, and freeze.</p>

stir in the corn-starch, which has been mixed with the cold milk. Cook
ten minutes. Beat the eggs and sugar together. Pour the cooked mixture
on this, stirring all the time. Return to the fire, add the gelatine,
which has been soaking in four table-spoonfuls of cold water, and cook
three minutes. Set away to cool. When cold, add the cream and vanilla,
and freeze. When the cream has been freezing ten minutes, take off the
cover and stir in the figs. Cover again and freeze until hard. Take out
the beater, and with a large spoon, pack the cream smoothly. Set away
until serving time.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Glac&eacute; M&eacute;ringue.</p>
<p>One quart of cream, one large cupful of granulated sugar and six
table-spoonfuls of powdered, one table-spoonful of vanilla extract, the
whites of six eggs, one cupful of milk, one table-spoonful of gelatine,
soaked an hour in four of cold water. Let the milk come to a boil, and
stir the gelatine into it. Strain into the cream. Add the vanilla and
granulated sugar. Turn into the tin, and freeze. When the mixture is

pack the cream smoothly, being careful to have the top perfectly level.
Set away until serving time. It should stand half an hour at least. When
ready to serve, beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, and
gradually beat into this the powdered sugar. Turn the cream out on an
earthen dish and cover every part with the m&eacute;ringue. Brown in a
hot oven, and serve immediately. If the dish is flat, put a board under
it. This keeps the heat from the bottom. <i>Glac&eacute; m&eacute;ringue</i>
is an elegant dish.</p>

one-third of a cupful of sugar and one teaspoonful of vanilla extract.
Put the mixture in a pan of ice water and whip to a stiff froth. Stir
this down, and whip again. Skim the froth into a deep dish. When all the
cream has been whipped to a froth, fill paper cases with it, and place
these in a large tin box (or, the freezer will do,) that is nearly
buried in ice and salt--two quarts of salt to six of ice--and is wholly
covered after the cases are put in. Let these remain there two hours.
Make a pint of strawberry sherbet. Put a thin layer of it on each case
of cream, and return to the freezer. Let the cases stand half an hour
longer, and serve. They should be arranged on a bright napkin, spread on
a flat dish.</p>

leaving out a third of a cupful to mix with the corn-starch. After
mixing, stir into the boiling milk, and cook eight minutes. Dissolve the
chocolate with half a cupful of the sugar and two table-spoonfuls of
boiling water. Add to the other mixture. Beat the yolks and add them and
the salt. Cook two minutes. Set in cold water, and beat until cool; then
add the flavor, and pour into a dish. Beat the whites of the eggs to a
stiff froth, add the remaining sugar, and heap on the custard. Dredge
with sugar. Brown with a salamander or hot shovel.</p>

of gelatine, half a cupful of sugar (unless the fruit is very acid, in
which case use a little more), one pint of soft custard, ten macaroons,
half a cupful of water. Soak the gelatine two hours in a little of the
water. Let the remainder of the water come to a boil, and pour it on the
soaked gelatine. Place the basin in another of hot water and stir until
all the gelatine is dissolved. Strain this into the fruit juice. Add the
sugar. Place the basin in a pan of ice water, and as soon as the mixture
begins to thicken, beat with a whisk until it hardens; then place in the
ice chest for a few hours. Brown the macaroons in a cool oven. Let them
cool and roll them fine. At serving time put the custard in a <i>souffl&eacute;</i>
dish. Heap the jelly on this, and cover all with the macaroon crumbs.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Charlotte Russe, No. 2.</p>
<p>One pint of <i>rich</i> cream, one teaspoonful of vanilla flavor,
one-third of a cupful of sugar. Mix all together in a tin pail and place
in a basin of ice water. Whip the cream to a stiff froth, and skim, into
a colander. When nearly whipped, return to the pail that which has
drained through the colander, and whip it again. Have a quart mould
lined with stale sponge cake. Fill it with whipped cream and set in the
ice chest for an hour or two.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Apple Charlotte.</p>
<p>One scant pint of apples, steamed, and rubbed through a sieve;
one-third of a box of gelatine, soaked an hour in one-third of a cupful
of cold water; one cupful of sugar, the juice of a large lemon, the
whites of three eggs. Pour half a cupful of boiling water upon the
gelatine, stir until thoroughly dissolved, and pour upon the apple; then
add the sugar and lemon juice. Place in a basin of ice water, and beat
until it begins to thicken. Add the whites of the eggs, beaten to a
stiff froth. Pour into a two-quart mould, which has been lined with
sponge cake, and put on ice to harden. Make a soft custard of the yolks
of the eggs, one pint of milk and three table-spoonfuls of sugar. When
the charlotte is turned out on a dish, pour this around.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Calf's Foot Jelly.</p>
<p>Four calf's feet, six quarts of water, the juice of two lemons and
rind of one, two cloves, a two-inch piece of stick cinnamon, two cupfuls
of sugar, a pint of wine, the whites and shells of two eggs. Wash the
feet very carefully and put them on with the cold water. Boil gently
until the water is reduced to two quarts; then strain through a napkin,
and set away to harden. In the morning scrape off all the fat and wipe
the jelly with a clean towel. Break it up and put in a kettle with the
other ingredients, having first beaten the whites of the eggs and the
shells with half a cupful of cold water. Let the mixture come to a boil
slowly, and set back for twenty minutes where it will keep at the
boiling point. Strain through a napkin, mould, and set away to harden.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Wine Jelly.</p>
<p>One box of gelatine, half a pint of cold water, a pint and a half of
boiling water, one pint of sherry, one of sugar, the juice of a lemon.
Soak the gelatine two hours in the cold water. Pour the boiling water on
it, and stir until dissolved. Add the lemon juice, sugar and wine.
Strain through a napkin, turn into moulds, and, when cold, place in the
ice chest for six or eight hours.</p>
<p>One good way to mould this jelly is to pour some of it into the
mould, harden it a little, put in a layer of strawberries, pour in jelly
to set them, and then enough to make another layer, then put in more
berries, and a third layer of jelly, and so continue, until all the
jelly has been used. </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Cider Jelly.</p>
<p>A box of gelatine, one pint of sugar, a quart and half a pint of
cider, half a pint of cold water. Soak the gelatine in the cold water
for two hours. Let the cider come to a boil, and pour it on the
gelatine. Add the sugar, strain through a napkin, and turn into moulds.
When cold, place in the refrigerator for six or eight hours.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Lemon Jelly.</p>
<p>Two cupfuls of sugar, one of lemon juice, one quart of boiling
water, one cupful of cold water, a box of gelatine. Soak the gelatine in
the cold water for two hours. Pour the boiling water on it, add the
sugar and lemon juice, strain through a napkin, mould and harden.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Orange Jelly.</p>
<p>One box of gelatine, one pint of orange juice, the juice of a lemon,
one pint of sugar, a pint and a half of boiling water, half a pint of
cold water, the white and shell of an egg. Soak the gelatine as for the
other jellies. Add the boiling water, sugar, the fruit juice, and the
white and shell of the egg, beaten with two table-spoonfuls of cold
water. Let the mixture come to a boil, and set back for twenty minutes
where it will keep hot, but will not boil. Strain through a napkin. A
pretty way to mould this jelly is to fill the mould to the depth of two
inches with liquid jelly, and, when this is hardened, put on a layer of
oranges, divided into eighths; to pour on a little more jelly, to set
the fruit, and then fill up with jelly. Keep in the ice chest for six or
eight hours.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Currant Jelly.</p>
<p>Make the same as wine jelly, using a pint of currant juice instead
of wine.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Strawberry Jelly.</p>
<p>Three pints of ripe strawberries, a box of gelatine, a pint of
sugar, one pint of boiling water, half a pint of cold water, the juice
of a lemon. Soak the gelatine for two hours in the cold water. Mash the
berries with the sugar, and let them stand two hours. Pour the boiling
water on the fruit and sugar. Press the juice from the strawberries and
add it and the lemon juice to the dissolved gelatine. Strain through a
napkin, pour into moulds, and harden. Raspberry jelly is made in the
same way.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Pineapple Jelly.</p>
<p>A pint-and-a-half can of pineapple, a scant pint of sugar, the white
and shell of an egg, a box of gelatine, the juice of a lemon, one quart
of boiling water, half a pint of cold water. Cut the pineapple in fine
pieces, put with the boiling water and simmer gently twenty minutes.
Soak the gelatine in the cold water for two hours. Add it, the sugar,
lemon and pineapple juice, and the white and shell of the egg to the
boiling mixture. Let this boil up once, and set back for twenty minutes
where it will keep hot, but will not boil. Strain through a napkin, turn
into moulds and set away to harden.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Coffee Jelly.</p>
<p>One pint of sugar, one of strong coffee, a pint and a half of
boiling water, half a pint of cold water, a box of gelatine. Soak the
gelatine two hours in the cold water. Pour the boiling water on it, and
when it is dissolved, add the sugar and coffee. Strain, turn into
moulds, and set away to harden. This is to be served with sugar and
cream.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Soft Custard.</p>
<p>One quart of milk, one scant half teacupful of sugar, half a
teaspoonful of salt, the yolks of eight eggs and whites of two, one
teaspoonful of lemon or vanilla flavor, or half as much of almond. Beat
the sugar and eggs together, and add one cupful of milk. Let the
remainder of the milk come to a boil, pour it on the beaten mixture, and
put this on the fire in the double boiler. Stir until it begins to
thicken, which will be in about five minutes, when add the salt, and set
away to cool. When cold, add the flavor. Serve in custard glasses.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Soft Caramel Custard.</p>
<p>One quart of milk, half a cupful of sugar, six eggs, half a
teaspoonful of salt. Put the milk on to boil, reserving a cupful. Beat
the eggs, and add the cold milk to them. Stir the sugar in a small
frying-pan until it becomes liquid and just begins to smoke. Stir it
into the boiling milk; then add the beaten eggs and cold milk, and stir
constantly until the mixture begins to thicken. Set away to cool. Serve
in glasses.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chocolate Whips.</p>
<p>One quart of milk, one (ounce) square of Baker's chocolate, one
generous half cupful of sugar, six eggs, a speck of salt. Scrape the
chocolate fine and put it in a small frying-pan with two table-spoonfuls
of the sugar and one of boiling water. When dissolved, add it to a pint
and a half of the milk, which should be hot in the double boiler. Beat
the eggs and the remainder of the sugar together, add the cold milk, and
stir into the boiling milk. Stir constantly until it begins to thicken.
Add the salt, and set away to cool. Season one pint of cream with two
table-spoonfuls of sugar and half a teaspoonful of vanilla extract. Whip
to a stiff froth. When the custard is cold, half fill glasses with it,
and heap whipped cream upon it. Or, it can be served in one large dish,
with the whipped cream on top.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Kisses.</p>
<p>Beat the whites of six eggs to a stiff froth. They should be beaten
until so light and dry that they begin to fly off of the beater. Stir in
a cupful of powdered sugar, gently and quickly. Spread paraffin paper
over three boards, which measure about nine by twelve inches. Drop the
mixture by spoonfuls on the boards, having perhaps a dozen on each one.
Dry in a warm oven for about three-quarters of an hour; then brown them
slightly. Lift from the paper and stick them together at the base by
twos. A dozen and a half can be made from the quantities given.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Cream M&eacute;ringues.</p>
<p>These are made similar to kisses, but are pat on the paper in oblong
shape, and dried two hours. Take from the board and, with a spoon,
remove all the soft part. Season half a pint of rich cream with a
table-spoonful of sugar and one of wine, or a speck of vanilla, and whip
it to a stiff froth. Fill the shells with this, and join them. Or, they
may be filled with ice cream. If the m&eacute;ringues are exposed to
much heat they are spoiled.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Kiss Wafers.</p>
<p>Half a pint of blanched bitter almonds, one heaping cupful of
powdered sugar, the whites of six eggs, one-third of a cupful of flour,
two table-spoonfuls of corn-starch. Blanch the almonds and pound them in
a mortar. As soon as they are a little broken add the white of an egg.
Pound until very fine. When there is a smooth paste add the sugar, a
little at a time, the whites of two eggs, one at a time, and the flour
and corn-starch. When thoroughly mixed, add, by degrees, the three
remaining whites. Butter the bottom of a flat baking pan and put the
mixture on it in spoonfuls. Spread it <i>very thin</i>, especially in
the centre, and bake in a quick oven. The moment the cakes are taken
from the oven, roll into the shape of cornucopias. If allowed to cool,
they cannot be rolled, and for this reason it is best to bake only half
a dozen at a time. When all are shaped, fill with the kiss mixture, made
by beating the whites of three eggs to a stiff froth, and stirring into
them, lightly, four table-spoonfuls of powdered sugar. Place the wafers
in a warm oven for twenty minutes or half an hour, to dry. With the
quantities given two dozen can be made.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Brier Hill Dessert.</p>
<p>Stew one quart of blackberries with one quart of sugar and half a
cupful of water. They should cook only fifteen minutes. When cold, serve
with powdered cracker and sugar and cream. The cracker and berries
should be in separate dishes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Richmond Maids of Honor.</p>
<p>In the little town of Richmond, England, is a small pastry shop
widely known for its cheese cakes. It is said that the original recipe
for them was furnished by a maid of Queen Elizabeth, who had a palace at
Richmond. In the neighboring city of London the cakes are in great
demand, and the popular opinion there is that the only place to get them
is the shop mentioned, where they are made somewhat as follows:</p>
<p>One cupful of sweet milk, one of sour, one of sugar, a lemon, the
yolks of four eggs, a speck of salt. Put all the milk in the double
boiler and cook until it curds; then strain. Rub the curd through a
sieve. Beat the sugar and yolks of eggs together, and add the rind and
juice of the lemon and the curd. Line little patty pans with puff or
chopped paste, rolled very thin. Put a large spoonful of the mixture in
each one, and bake from fifteen to twenty minutes in a moderate oven. Do
not remove from the pans until cold. These are nice for suppers or
lunches as well as for dessert.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Fanchonettes.</p>
<p>One cupful of sugar, half a cupful of water, one table-spoonful of
corn-starch, one teaspoonful of butter, the yolks of four eggs, the
juice and rind of two lemons. Mix the cornstarch with a little cold
water, and stir in half a cupful of boiling water. Beat the sugar, eggs
and lemon together, and stir into the boiling corn-starch. Place the
basin in another of boiling water, and stir (over the fire) until it
thickens, perhaps from eight to ten minutes; then add the butter and set
away to cool. Line little patty pans with puff paste, or any rich paste,
rolled very thin. Put a spoonful of the mixture in each one, and bake in
a slow oven from twelve to twenty minutes. When cool, slip out of the
pans, and serve on a napkin. They are nice for lunch, tea or children's
parties, only for parties make them small. The mixture for fanchonettes
will keep a number of weeks in a cool place, so that if one makes a
quantity at one time, portions can be used with the trimmings of pastry
left from pies.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Fruit Glac&egrave;.</p>
<p>Boil together for half an hour one cupful of granulated sugar, one
of water. Dip the point of a skewer in the syrup, after it has been
boiling the given time, and then in water. If the thread formed breaks
off brittle the syrup is done. Have oranges pared, divided into eighths
and wiped free of moisture. Pour part of the hot syrup into a small cup,
which keep in boiling water. Take the pieces of orange on the point of a
large needle or skewer and dip them in the syrup. Place them on a dish
that has been buttered lightly. Grapes, cherries, walnuts, etc., can be
prepared in the same way. Care must be taken not to stir the syrup, as
that spoils it.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> G&acirc;teau Saint Honor&eacute;.</p>
<p>Make a paste the same as for <i>&eacute;clairs</i>. Butter three
pie plates. Roll puff or chopped paste very thin, and cover the plates
with it. Cut off the paste about an inch from the edge all round the
plates. Spread a thin layer of the cooked paste over the puff paste. Put
a tube, measuring about half an inch in diameter, in a pastry bag. Turn
the remainder of the paste into the bag and press it through the tube on
to the edges of the plates, where the puff paste has been cut off. Care
must be taken to have the border of equal thickness all round the
plates. With a fork, prick holes in the paste in the centre of the
plate. Bake half an hour in a moderate oven. When the plates have been
put in the oven, make what paste is left in the bag into balls about
half the size of an American walnut. There will be enough for three
dozen. Drop them into a pan that has been buttered lightly, and bake
fifteen or twenty minutes. While they are baking, put half a cupful of
water and half a cupful of granulated sugar in a small sauce-pan, and
boil twenty-five minutes.</p>
<p>When the little balls and the paste in the plate is done, take the
balls on the point of a skewer or large needle, dip them in the syrup
and place them on the border of paste (the syrup will hold them), about
two inches apart. A word of caution just here: Do not stir the syrup, as
that will make it grain, and, of course, spoil it. A good plan is to
pour part of the syrup into a small cup, which place in hot water. That
remaining in the sauce-pan should be kept hot, but it should not boil,
until needed. When all the balls have been used, dip four dozen French
candied cherries in the syrup, and stick them between the balls. Reserve
about fifteen cherries, with which to garnish the centre of the cake.
Whip one pint and a half of cream to a froth. Soak half a package of
gelatine in half a cupful of milk for two hours. Pour on this half a
cupful of boiling milk. Place the pan of whipped cream in another of ice
water, and sprinkle over it two-thirds of a cupful of sugar and nearly a
teaspoonful of vanilla flavor. Strain the gelatine on this, and stir
gently from the bottom until it begins to thicken. When it will just
pour, fill the three plates with it, and set them in the ice chest for
half an hour. Garnish the top with the remaining cherries, and serve.
This is an excellent dish for dessert or party suppers.<br>

flavor. Beat the butter to a cream, and gradually beat in the sugar. Add
the flavor. Mix the flour, cream of tartar and soda together, and sift.
Beat the whites to a stiff froth. Add the corn-starch and milk to the
beaten sugar and butter; then add the whites of the eggs and the flour.
Mix quickly and thoroughly. Have the batter in sheets, and about two
inches deep. Bake in a moderate oven for about half an hour. A chocolate
frosting is nice with this cake. [Mrs. L. C. A.]</p>

<p>The whites of eleven eggs, one and a half cupfuls of granulated
sugar, one cupful of pastry flour, measured after being sifted four
times; one teaspoonful of cream of tartar, one of vanilla extract. Sift
the flour and cream of tartar together. Beat the whites to a stiff
froth. Beat the sugar into the eggs, and add the seasoning and flour,
stirring quickly and lightly. Beat until ready to put the mixture in the
oven. Use a pan that has little legs at the top corners, so that when
the pan is turned upside down on the table, after the baking, a current
of air will pass under and over it. Bake for forty minutes in a moderate
oven. Do not grease the pan.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Sunshine Cake.</p>
<p>This is made almost exactly like angel cake. Have the whites of
eleven eggs and yolks of six, one and a half cupfuls of granulated
sugar, measured after one sifting; one cupful of flour, measured after
sifting; one teaspoonful of cream of tartar and one of orange extract.

the yolks in a similar manner, and add to them the whites and sugar and
the flavor. Finally, stir in the flour. Mix quickly and well. Bake for
fifty minutes in a slow oven, using a pan like that for angel cake.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Demon Cake.</p>
<p>One cupful of butter, one of sugar, one of molasses, two eggs, four
and one-fourth cupfuls of flour, one table-spoonful of ginger, one of
cinnamon, four of brandy, half a grated nutmeg, one teaspoonful of soda,

beaten, and add them. Stir in the soda and flour. Have two pans well
buttered, or lined with paraffin paper. Pour the cake mixture, to the
depth of about two inches, in each pan. Sprinkle a layer of fruit on it.
Cover with a thin layer of the mixture, and add more fruit. Continue
this until all the batter and fruit is used. Bake two hours in a
moderate oven.</p>

flour, one small cupful of milk, the yolks of five eggs and whites of
three, one teaspoonful of cream of tartar, half a teaspoonful of soda,
or one and a half teaspoonfuls of baking powder, one teaspoonful of
lemon extract, or the juice of one fresh lemon. Beat the butter to a
cream. Add the sugar, gradually, then the seasoning, the eggs, well
beaten, next the milk and then the flour, in which the soda and cream of
tartar are mixed. Mix thoroughly, but quickly, and bake in two sheets in
a moderate oven for twenty-five or thirty minutes. Cover with a frosting
made by stirring two small cupfuls of powdered sugar into the whites of
two eggs, and seasoning with lemon.</p>

place until light, and then add flour enough to make as thick as for
biscuit. Shape, and put in a pan in which they are to be baked, and let
them stand two or three hours (three hours unless the weather is very
warm). Bake about forty minutes in a moderate oven. It is always best to
set the sponge at night, for it will then be ready to bake the following
forenoon. If the rusks are wanted warm for tea, the sponge must, of
course, be set early in the morning.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Taylor Cake.</p>
<p>Half a cupful of butter, two and a half of sugar, one of milk, three
and a half of pastry flour, three eggs, one teaspoonful of cream of
tartar, half a teaspoonful of soda, flavor to taste. Beat the butter to
a cream, then beat in the sugar, next the eggs, well beaten; the
seasoning, the milk, and lastly the flour, in which the soda and cream
of tartar have been thoroughly mixed. Bake in a moderate oven, either in
loaves or sheets. If in sheets, twenty-five minutes; if in loaves,
forty-five. The quantities given are for two loaves or sheets. This cake
is nice for Washington or chocolate pies, and is good baked in sheets
and frosted.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Loaf Cake.</p>
<p>Two quarts of sugar, seven cupfuls of butter, six quarts of sifted
flour, six pounds of fruit, one pint of wine, one pint of yeast, eight
nutmegs, mace, twelve eggs, one quart of milk. It should be made at such
an hour (being governed by the weather) as will give it time to get
perfectly light by evening. It should stand about six hours in summer
and eight in whiter.</p>
<p>Put in half the butter and eggs, and the milk, flavor and yeast, and
beat thoroughly. In the evening add the remainder of the butter, rubbing
it with the sugar, the rest of the eggs, and the spice. Let the cake
rise again, until morning; then add the fruit. Put in deep pans, and let
rise about half an hour. Bake from two to three hours in a slow oven.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chocolate Cake.</p>
<p>One and a half cupfuls of sugar, half a cupful of butter, half a
cupful of milk, one and three-fourths cupfuls of flour, a quarter of a
pound of Baker's chocolate, three eggs, one teaspoonful of cream of
tartar, half a teaspoonful of soda. Scrape the chocolate fine, and add
five table-spoonfuls of sugar to it (this in addition to the cupful and
a half). Beat the butter to a cream. Gradually add the sugar, beating
all the while. Add three table-spoonfuls of boiling water to the
chocolate and sugar. Stir over the fire until smooth and glossy; then
stir into the beaten sugar and butter. Add to this mixture the eggs,
well beaten, then the milk and the flour, in which the soda and cream of
tartar have been thoroughly mixed. Bake twenty minutes in a moderate
oven. This will make two sheets. Frost it, if you like.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chocolate Cake, No. 2.</p>
<p>One cupful of butter, two of sugar, three and a half of Sour, one of
milk, five eggs--the whites of two being left out, one teaspoonful of
cream of tartar and half a teaspoonful of soda, or one and a half of
baking powder. Beat the butter to a cream. Add the sugar, gradually,
then the eggs, well beaten, the milk, next the flour, in which the soda
and cream of tartar have been well mixed. Bake in two sheets for thirty
minutes in a moderate oven, and ice.</p>
<p>Icing: The whites of two eggs, one and a half cupfuls of powdered
sugar, six table-spoonfuls of grated chocolate, one teaspoonful of
vanilla. Put the chocolate and six table-spoonfuls of the sugar in a
sauce-pan with two spoonfuls of hot water. Stir over a hot fire until
smooth and glossy. Beat the whites to a froth, and add the sugar and
chocolate.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Orange Cake.</p>
<p>Two cupfuls of sugar, a small half cupful of butter, two cupfuls of
flour, half a cupful of water, the yolks of five eggs and whites of
four, half a teaspoonful of soda, a teaspoonful of cream of tartar, the
rind of one orange and the juice of one and a half. Beat the butter to a
cream. Add the sugar, gradually, then the orange, the eggs, well beaten,
the water and the flour, in which the soda and cream of tartar have been
well mixed. Bake in sheets for twenty-five minutes, in a moderate oven,
and when cool, frost.</p>
<p>Frosting: The white of an egg, the juice of one and a half oranges
and the grated rind of one, one cupful and a half of powdered sugar,
unless the egg and oranges are very large, in which case use two cupfuls.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Railroad Cake.</p>
<p>Two cupfuls of sugar, two of flour, six table-spoonfuls of butter,
two of milk, six eggs, one teaspoonful of saleratus, two of cream of
tartar, lemon peel. Bake in shallow pans in a quick oven.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Hot Water Sponge Cake.</p>
<p>Six eggs, two cupfuls of sugar, two of pastry flour, half a cupful
of <i>boiling</i> water, the grated rind of half a lemon, and one
teaspoonful of the juice. Beat the yolks and sugar to a froth; also,
beat the whites to a stiff froth. Add the lemon to the yolks and sugar,
then add the boiling water, next the whites, and, last of all, the
flour. Mix quickly, and bake in two sheets for half an hour, in a
moderate oven.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Sponge Cake.</p>
<p>Ten eggs, two and a half cupfuls of sugar, two and a half of pastry
flour, the juice and grated rind of one lemon. Beat the yolks and sugar
together until very light. Add the lemon. Beat the whites to a stiff
froth. Stir the flour and this froth alternately into the beaten yolks
and sugar. Have the batter about three inches deep in the pan. Sprinkle
with sugar, and bake three-quarters of an hour in a moderate oven. If
the batter is not so deep in the pan it will not take so long to bake.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Sponge Cake, No. 2.</p>
<p>The yolks of a dozen eggs and whites of eight, one and three-fourths
cupfuls of sugar, the same quantity of flour, the rind of one lemon and
juice of two. Beat the yolks and sugar together. Add the lemon rind and
juice and beat a little longer. Beat the whites to a stiff froth, and
add them to the mixture. Gradually stir in the flour. Pour the mixture
into a baking pan to the depth of about two inches. Bake from
thirty-five to forty minutes in a slow oven.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Viennois Oakes.</p>
<p>Cut any kind of plain cake into small squares. Cut a small piece
from the centre of each square, and fill the cavity with some kind of
marmalade or jelly. Replace the crust part that was removed, and cover
with icing. These cakes are nice for dessert.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Dominos.</p>
<p>Have any kind of sponge cake baked in a rather thin sheet. Cut this
into small oblong pieces, the shape of a domino. Frost the top and sides
of them. When the frosting is hard, draw the black lines and make the
dots with a small brush that has been dipped in melted chocolate. These
are particularly good for children's parties.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Lady-Fingers.</p>
<p>Four eggs, three-fourths of a cupful of pastry flour, half a cupful
of <i>powdered</i> sugar. Have the bottom of three large baking pans
covered with paraffin paper or sheets of buttered note paper. Beat the
yolks of the eggs and the sugar to a froth. Beat the whites to a stiff,
dry froth, and add to the yolks and sugar. Add the flour, and stir
quickly and gently. Pour the mixture into the pastry bag, and press it
through on to the paper in the shape and of the size you wish. When all
the mixture has been used, sprinkle powdered sugar on the cakes, and
bake from twelve to sixteen minutes in a <i>very</i> slow oven.</p>
<p>Caution. The mixture must be stirred, after the flour is added, only
enough to mix the flour lightly with the sugar and eggs. Much stirring
turns the mixture liquid. If the oven is hot the fingers will rise and
fall, and if too cool they will spread. It should be about half as hot
as for bread.</p>
<p>You will not succeed in using the pastry bag the first time, but a
little practice will make it easy to get the forms wished. There are
pans especially for baking lady-fingers. They are quite expensive.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Sponge Drops.</p>
<p>Make the batter the same as for lady-fingers, and drop on the paper
in teaspoonfuls. Sprinkle with sugar. Bake in a slow oven from twelve to
sixteen minutes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Sponge Drops, No. 2.</p>
<p>Three eggs, one and a half cupfuls of sugar, two of flour, half a
cupful of cold water, one teaspoonful of cream of tartar, half a
teaspoonful of saleratus. Beat the sugar and eggs together. Add the
water when they are light, and then the flour, in which mix the
saleratus and cream of tartar. Flavor with lemon. Have muffin cups very
lightly buttered, and drop a teaspoonful of the mixture into each one.
Bake in a quick oven. These drops are nice for dessert or tea.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Sponge Cake for Charlotte Russe.</p>
<p>Line the bottoms of two shallow baking pans with paraffin Paper or
buttered paper, and spread the lady-finger mixture on it. Bake slowly
eighteen minutes. Cut paper to fit the sides of the mould. When the cake
is cold, lay this pattern on it and cut with a sharp knife.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Jelly Roll.</p>
<p>Make the sponge cake mixture as for lady-fingers, and bake in one
shallow pan twenty minutes. While it is yet warm, cut off the edges, and
spread the cake with any kind of jelly. Roll up, and pin a towel around
it. Put in a cool place until serving time. Cut in slices with a sharp
knife.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Molasses Pound Coke.</p>
<p>One quart of molasses, one pint of water, six and a half pints of
flour, one ounce of soda, half an ounce of alum, one heaping cupful of
butter, six eggs, one ounce of cinnamon, one pound of raisins. Boil the
alum in part of the pint of water, and let it cool before mixing with
the other ingredients. Instead of alum, one ounce of cream of tartar may
be used.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Soft Gingerbread.</p>
<p>Six cupfuls of flour, three of molasses, one of cream, one of lard
or butter, two eggs, one teaspoonful of saleratus, and two of ginger.
This is excellent.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Hard Gingerbread.</p>
<p>One cupful of sugar, one of butter, one-third of a cupful of
molasses, half a cupful of sour milk or cream, one teaspoonful of
saleratus, one table-spoonful of ginger, flour enough to roll. Roll
thin, cut in oblong pieces, and bake quickly. Care must be taken that
too much flour is not mixed in with the dough. All kinds of cakes that
are rolled should have no more flour than is absolutely necessary to
work them.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Canada Gingerbread.</p>
<p>One cupful of butter, two of sugar, one of molasses, five of flour,
three eggs, one nutmeg, one teaspoonful of ginger, one of soda, one
tea-cupful of cream or rich milk, one table-spoonful of cinnamon, one
pound of currants. Beat the butter to a cream. Add the sugar, molasses
and spice; next the eggs, well beaten; then the milk, in which the soda
has been dissolved, next the flour; and lastly the currants. This will
make three sheets, or two very thick ones. Bake in a moderately-quick
oven, if in three sheets, twenty five minutes; if in two sheets, ten
minutes longer.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Fairy Gingerbread.</p>
<p>One cupful of butter, two of sugar, one of milk, four of flour,
three-fourths of a teaspoonful of soda, one table-spoonful of ginger.
Beat the butter to a cream. Add the sugar, gradually, and when very
light, the ginger, the milk, in which the soda has been dissolved, and
finally the flour. Turn baking pans upside down and wipe the bottoms
very clean. Butter them, and spread the cake mixture very thin on them;
Bake in a moderate oven until brown. While still <i>hot</i>, cut into
squares with a case-knife and slip from the pan. Keep in a tin box. This
is delicious. With the quantities given a large dish of gingerbread can
be made. It must be spread on the bottom of the pan as thin as a wafer
and cut the moment it comes from the oven.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Shewsbury Cake.</p>
<p>Two cupfuls of butter, one pint of sugar, three pints of flour, four
eggs, half a teaspoonful of mace. Roll thin, cut into small cakes, and
bake in a quick oven. Not a particle more of flour than what is given
above must be used. The cakes should be made in a rather cool room, and
they cannot be made in very warm weather. They can be kept a long time,
and are delicious.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Jumbles.</p>
<p>Three cupfuls of sugar, two of butter, five of flour, one egg, half
a teaspoonful of soda, flavor to taste. Roll thin, sprinkle with sugar,
cut in round cakes, and cut a small piece from the centre of each. Bake
in a quick oven.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Seed Cakes.</p>
<p>Three-fourths of a pint of sugar, one cupful of butter, a quart and
half a pint of flour, one teaspoonful of saleratus, two eggs, and seeds.
Roll thin, cut in round cakes, and bake quickly.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Cookies.</p>
<p>One cupful of butter, two of sugar, five of flour, a teaspoonful of
saleratus, dissolved in four of milk; one egg, flavor to taste. Roll and
bake like seed cakes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Hermits.</p>
<p>Two cupfuls of sugar, one of butter, one of raisins (stoned and
chopped), three eggs, half a teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in three
table-spoonfuls of milk; a nutmeg, one teaspoonful each of clove and
cinnamon, and six cupfuls of flour. Roll about one-fourth of an inch
thick, and cut with a round cake cutter. Bake in a rather quick oven. It
will take about twelve minutes. [Mrs. L. C. A.]</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Kneaded Plum Cake.</p>
<p>Two and a half cupfuls of sugar, half a cupful of butter, half a
cupful of sour milk, two spoonfuls of cream, a teaspoonful of saleratus,
half a spoonful of cinnamon and of nutmeg, a cupful of chopped raisins,
and flour enough to knead (about six cupfuls). Roll an inch thick, and
cut in oblong pieces. Bake on sheets in a quick oven.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Eclairs.</p>
<p>Put one cupful of boiling water and half a cupful of butter in a
large sauce-pan, and when it boils up, turn in one pint of flour. Beat
well with the vegetable masher. When perfectly smooth, and velvety to
the touch, remove from the fire. Break five eggs into a bowl. When the
paste is nearly cold, beat the eggs into it with the hand. Only a small
part of the eggs should be added at a time. When the mixture is
thoroughly beaten (it will take about twenty minutes), spread on
buttered sheets in oblong pieces about four inches long and one and a
half wide. These must be about two inches apart. Bake in a rather quick
oven for about twenty-five minutes. As soon as they are done, ice with
either chocolate or vanilla frosting. When the icing is cold, cut the <i>&eacute;clairs</i>
on one side and fill them.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chocolate &Eacute;clairs.</p>
<p>Put one cupful and a half of milk in the double boiler. Beat
together two-thirds of a cupful of sugar, one-fourth of a cupful of
flour, two eggs, and one-fourth of a teaspoonful of salt. Stir the
mixture into the boiling milk. Cook fifteen minutes, stirring often.
When cold, flavor with one teaspoonful of vanilla extract. Put two
squares of scraped chocolate with five table-spoonfuls of powdered sugar
and three of boiling water. Stir over the fire until smooth and glossy.
Dip the tops of the <i>&eacute;clairs</i> in this as they come from the
oven. When the chocolate icing is dry, cut open, and fill with the
cream, which should be cold. If a chocolate flavor is liked with the
cream, one table-spoonful of the dissolved chocolate may be added to it.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Vanilla &Eacute;clairs.</p>
<p>Make an icing with the whites of two eggs and a cupful and a half of
powdered sugar. Flavor with one teaspoonful of vanilla extract. Frost
the <i>&eacute;clairs</i>; and when dry, open, and fill with a cream,
the same as chocolate <i>&eacute;clairs</i>. They may be filled with
cream sweetened, flavored with vanilla and whipped to a stiff froth.
Strawberry and raspberry preserves are sometimes used to fill <i>&eacute;clairs</i>.
They are then named after the fruit with which they are filled.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Frosting.</p>
<p>The white of one egg, one tea-cupful of powdered sugar, one
table-spoonful of lemon juice. Put the white of the egg in a bowl and
add the sugar by degrees, beating with a spoon. When all has been added,
stir in the lemon juice. If the white of the egg is large it will
require a very full cup of sugar, and if small, a rather scant cupful.
The egg must <i>not</i> be beaten until the sugar is added. This gives a
smooth, tender frosting, which will cover one small sheet of cake. The
same amount of material, prepared with the whites of the eggs unbeaten,
will make one-third less frosting than it will if the eggs are beaten
to a stiff froth before adding the sugar; but the icing will be enough
smoother and softer to pay for the extra quantity. It may be flavored
with half a teaspoonful of vanilla.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chocolate Icing.</p>
<p>Two squares of Baker's chocolate, the whites of two eggs, two
cupfuls of powdered sugar, four table-spoonfuls of boiling water. Beat
one and two-thirds cupfuls of the sugar into the unbeaten whites of the
eggs. Scrape the chocolate, and put it and the remaining third of a
cupful of sugar and the water in a small frying-pan. Stir over a hot
fire until smooth and glossy, and then stir into the beaten whites and
sugar. With the quantity given two sheets of cake can be iced.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chocolate Icing, No. 2.</p>
<p>Soak a teaspoonful of gelatine one or two hours in three
table-spoonfuls of water. Pour on it one-fourth of a cupful of boiling
water, and stir into it one and two-thirds cupfuls of powdered sugar.
Prepare two squares of chocolate as for the first icing, and stir them
into this mixture. Use immediately.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Caramel Frosting.</p>
<p>One cupful of brown sugar, one square of Baker's chocolate, scraped
fine; one table-spoonful of water. Simmer gently twenty minutes, being
careful not to let it burn. Spread on the cake while hot.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Golden Frosting.</p>
<p>Into the yolks of two eggs stir powdered sugar enough to thicken,
and flavor strongly with lemon. This does not have so good a flavor as
other kinds of frosting, but it makes a change.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Marking Cakes in Gold.</p>
<p>Bake round cakes for the children, and when the frosting on them is
hard, dip a small brush into the yolk of an egg, and write a word or
name upon the cake. It pleases the little ones very much.<br>
<br>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><big><a name="PRESERVING"></a>
PRESERVING.</big></big></p>
<p>In using self-sealing glass jars great care must be taken. If the
work is properly done the fruit can be kept for years. Have a kettle of
hot water on the stove beside the preserving kettle, and also a small
dipper of hot water. Plunge a jar into the hot water, having the water
strike both inside and outside the jar at the same time. If you set it
down instead of plunging it, it will break. Put the cover in the dipper.
When the jar is hot, lift it up and pour the water from it into the
kettle. Stand the jar in the hot water and fill it with hot fruit from
the preserving kettle. Fill to the brim with the hot syrup. Take the
cover from the dipper of hot water and screw it on very tightly. In
using the jars a second time have the right cover and band for each one.
A. large-mouthed tunnel, such as grocers have, is almost indispensible
in the work of preserving.</p>
<p>Jellies and jams should be put in tumblers or bowls. A paper should
be cut to fit the top, and then wet in brandy, and another paper should
be pasted over it Jelly tumblers with glass covers are more convenient
than the old-fashioned ones, and where they are used the second paper
cover is not necessary. It is better not to cover until some weeks after
the jelly is made. White crushed sugar is much the nicest for
preserving. If jelly does not seem hard, as it should be the day after
it is made, it can be set in the sun for several hours, which will help
it greatly.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Strawberries.</p>
<p>To each pound of berries allow half a pound of sugar. Put the
berries in a kettle, and mash them a little, so that there will be juice
enough to cook them without using water. Stir them to prevent scorching.
Cook fifteen minutes; then add the sugar, and let them boil hard one
minute. Put them in the jars as directed. More or less sugar may be
used, as one prefers.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Raspberries.</p>
<p>To each pound of berries allow three-fourths of a pound of sugar,
and cook the same as the strawberries.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Cherries.</p>
<p>Cherries may be preserved either with or without stones. Many think
the stones give a richer flavor. To each pound of cherries allow one
third of a pound of sugar. Put the sugar in the kettle with half a pint
of water to three pounds of sugar. Stir it until it is dissolved. When
boiling, add the cherries, and cook three minutes; then put in the jars.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Currants.</p>
<p>Currants should be prepared the same as raspberries.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Pineapple.</p>
<p>Pare the fruit, and be sure you take out all the eyes and discolored
parts. Cut in slices, and cut the slices in small bits, taking out the
core. Weigh the fruit, and put in a pan with half as many pounds of
sugar as of fruit. Let it stand over night In the morning put it over
the fire and let it boil rapidly for a minute only, as cooking long
discolors it. Put it in the jars as directed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Grated Pineapple.</p>
<p>Pare the fruit clean; then grate it on a coarse grater, rejecting
the cores. Weigh it, and put to each pound of fruit a pound of sugar.
Let it stand over night. In the morning boil for a minute, and it is
done. Put it in jars as directed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Blackberries.</p>
<p>Blackberries are prepared like strawberries. If they are quite ripe,
not quite so much sugar is needed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Whortleberries.</p>
<p>To each quart of berries allow one-third of a pound of sugar, and
half a pint of water to three pounds of sugar. Put the water and sugar
over the fire, and when boiling hot, add the berries. Cook three
minutes. Put in the jars as directed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Crab-Apples.</p>
<p>To each pound of fruit allow half a pound of sugar, and a pint of
water to three pounds of sugar. When the syrup is boiling hot, drop in
the apples. They will cook very quickly. When done, fill a jar with the
fruit, and fill it up with syrup.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Pears.</p>
<p>Pare the fruit and cut in halves. Throw into cold water, or they
will be discolored. Use one pound of sugar for three of fruit, and one
quart of water for three pounds of sugar. When the syrup is boiling,
take the pears from the water, and drop into the syrup. Cook until they
can be pierced easily with a silver fork. Fill the jars with fruit, and
fill up to the brim with syrup, using a small strainer in the tunnel,
that the syrup may look clear. Bartlett pears are delicious, as are,
also, Seckel; but many other varieties are good.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Peaches.</p>
<p>Have ready a kettle of boiling water. Fill a wire basket with
peaches and plunge them into the boiling water. In two minutes take them
out, and the skins will come off easily. Drop the fruit into cold water,
to keep the color. For three pounds of fruit use one pound of sugar, and
one pint of water for three pounds of sugar. When the syrup is boiling
hot, take the fruit from the water, and drop into it. Put but a few in
at a time, as they cook very quickly. Take them from the syrup with a
silver fork, fill the jar, and fill up with strained syrup. Peaches are
much nicer preserved whole, as the stones give a rich flavor.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Brandied Peaches.</p>
<p>The Morris white peaches are the best. Take off the skins with
boiling water. To each pound of fruit allow one pound of sugar, and half
a pint of water to three pounds of sugar. When the syrup is boiling hot,
put in the peaches, and as fast as they cook, take them out carefully
and spread on platters. When cool, put them in jars, and fill up these
with syrup, using one-half syrup and one-half pale brandy. First-proof
alcohol, diluted with an equal quantity of water, can be used, instead
of brandy, but it is not, of course, so nice.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Plums.</p>
<p>The large white plums must be skinned by using boiling water, as for
peaches, and then throwing them into cold water. For one pound of fruit
allow half a pound of sugar, and half a pint of water for three pounds
of sugar. Cook but few at a time, and take them out carefully. Fill up
the jar with hot syrup.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Damsons.</p>
<p>Wash the fruit, and for one pound of it use half a pound of sugar,
and half a pint of water for three pounds of sugar. When the syrup is
boiling hot, put in the fruit, and cook three minutes. Dip the plums and
syrup together into the jars.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Quinces.</p>
<p>Pare and quarter the fruit, and take out all the cores and the hard
place around them. Boil the fruit in clear water until tender; then
spread it on towels to dry. For one pound of fruit allow half a pound of
sugar, and one pint of water for three pounds of sugar. When the syrup
is boiling hot, put in the fruit, and let it cook very slowly; or, set
it back on the stove so that it hardly cooks at all, and keep it on for
an hour or more, if you can without its cooking to pieces--as the longer
it cooks, the brighter red color it will be. Put it in jars, and strain
the syrup over it, as with other fruits.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Sour Oranges.</p>
<p>Grate off the rind, cut the orange into two parts, and remove the
pulp. Weigh the peel, place it in a large stone pot, and cover with
brine made of three gallons of water and a quart of salt. Let it stand
twenty-four hours, and drain off the brine. Again cover the peel with
brine made of the same quantity of water and half as much salt as was
first used, and let it stand another day. Drain, cover with clear cold
water, and let it stand a third day. Drain again, and put in a boiler
and cover with fresh cold water. Let it come to a boil, and boil fifteen
minutes; then take out and drain. Make a syrup of three quarts of sugar
and one of water, for every six pounds of peel. When the syrup is clear,
drop in the peel and boil until it is clear and tender--perhaps four
hours of slow boiling. Great care must be taken that it is not scorched.
It must be stirred every fifteen minutes. The sugar may be either white
or brown. The orange used is not the common orange, but the wild, sour
fruit, found in Florida. The pulp may be used for marmalade.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Grapes.</p>
<p>Squeeze the pulp of the grapes out of the skins. Cook fee pulp (a
few minutes) until you can press it all through a sieve. Reject the
seeds. Add a little water to the skins, and cook until they are quite
tender. Then put the skins and pulp together. Measure; and to each pint
add a pound of sugar, and boil fifteen minutes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Apple Ginger.</p>
<p>Four pounds each of apple and sugar. Make a syrup of the sugar,
adding a pint of water. Chop the apple very fine--with one ounce of

</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><big><a name="POTTING"></a> POTTING.</big></big></p>
<p>For potting, one should have small stone or earthen jars, a little
larger at the top than at the bottom, so that the meat may be taken out
whole, and then cut in thin slices. All kinds of cooked meats and fish
can be potted. The meat must, of course, be well cooked and tender, so
that it can be readily pounded to a paste. Of the fish, salmon and
halibut are the best for potting. When the potted meat or fish is to be
served, scrape off all the butter, run a knife between the meat and the
jar, and, when the meat is loosened, turn it out on a dish. Cut it in
thin slices, and garnish with parsley; or, serve it whole, and slice it
at the table. The butter that covered meats can be used for basting
roasted meats, and that which covered fish can be used for basting
baking fish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Beef.</p>
<p>Three pounds of the upper part of the round of beef, half a cupful
of butter, one table-spoonful of salt, one-fourth of a teaspoonful of
pepper, a speck of cayenne, one-eighth of a teaspoonful of mace, the
same quantity of clove, a bouquet of sweet herbs, three table-spoonfuls
of water. Cut the meat in small pieces and put it in a jar with the
water, herbs and seasoning. Mix one cupful of flour with water enough to
make a stiff paste. Cover the mouth of the jar with paper, and spread
over this the paste. Place the jar in a pan of hot water and put in a
moderate oven for five hours. Take up and remove the cover and herbs.
Pound the meat to a paste, add half of the butter to it, and when
thoroughly mixed, pack solidly in small jars. Melt the remainder of the
butter and pour it over the meat. Paste paper over the jars, put on the
covers, and set away in a cool, dry place. Veal may be potted in the
same manner, omitting the clove.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chicken.</p>
<p>One quart of cold roasted chicken, one cupful of cold boiled ham,
four table-spoonfuls of butter, a speck of cayenne, a slight grating of
nutmeg, and two teaspoonfuls of salt. Free the chicken of skin and

and a speck of cayenne. To each pint of the paste add one table-spoonful
of butter and one teaspoonful of mixed mustard. Pack closely in little
stone jars. Place these in a moderate oven in a pan of hot water. Cook
half an hour. When cool, cover the tongue with melted butter. Cover, and
put away.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Ham.</p>
<p>Cut all the meat, fat and lean, from the remains of a boiled ham,
being careful not to mix with it either the outside pieces or the
gristle. Chop very fine, and pound to a paste with the vegetable masher.
To each pint of the paste add one teaspoonful of mixed mustard and a
speck of cayenne, and, if there was not much fat on the meat, one
table-spoonful of butter, Pack this smoothly in small earthen jars.
Paste paper over these, and put on the covers. Place the pots in a
baking pan, which, when in the oven, should be filled with hot water.
Bake slowly two hours. Cool with, the covers on. When cold, take off the
covers and pour melted butter over the meat. Cover again, and set away
in a cool place. The ham will keep for months. It is a nice relish for
tea, and makes delicious sandwiches.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Marbled Veal.</p>
<p>Trim all the roots and tough parts from a boiled pickled tongue,
which chop and pound to a paste. Have two quarts of cold roasted or
boiled veal chopped and pounded to a paste. Mix two table-spoonfuls of
butter and a speck of cayenne with the tongue, and with the veal mix
four table-spoonfuls of butter, one of salt, one-fourth of a teaspoonful
of pepper and a speck of mace. Butter a deep earthen dish. Put a layer
of the veal in it and pack down solidly; then put spoonfuls of the
tongue here and there on the veal, and fill in the spaces with veal.
Continue this until all the meat has been used, and pack very solidly.
Cover the dish, and place it in the oven in a pan of water. Cook one
hour. When cold, pour melted butter over it. Cover, and set away.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Fish.</p>
<p>Take any kind of cooked fish and free it of skin and bones. To each
quart of fish add one table-spoonful of essence of anchovy, three of
butter, two teaspoonfuls of salt, a little white pepper and a speck of
cayenne. Pound the fish to a paste before adding the butter and anchovy.
When all the ingredients are thoroughly mixed, pack the fish closely in
little size jars. Place these in a pan of water and put in a moderate
oven. Cook forty-five minutes. When cold, pour melted butter over the
fish. Paste paper over the top, and set way.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Lobster.</p>
<p>Prepare and pot lobster the same as fish. If there is "coral" in the
lobster, pound it with the meat.</p>

<p>Nine pounds of small mackerel (about twenty-five in number), one
ounce of whole cloves, one of pepper-corns, one of whole allspice, six
teaspoonfuls of salt, three pints of vinegar. Wash the mackerel and pack
them in small, deep earthen or stone pots. Three will be needed for the
quantities given. Divide the spice into six parts. Put each portion in a
small piece of muslin, and tie. Sprinkle two teaspoonfuls of salt on the
fish in each pot, and put two of the little bags of spice in each pot.
Cover the fish with the vinegar; and if there should not be enough, use
more. Cover the pots with old plates, and place in a moderate oven. Bake
the fish four hours. Cool, and put away in the pots in which they were
baked. They will keep five or six months. Where oil is liked, half a
cupful can be added to each pot with the vinegar. Any kind of small fish
can be potted in this manner.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Smelts.</p>
<p>Six dozen smelts, one pint of olive oil, three pints of vinegar, or
enough to cover the smelts; three table-spoonfuls of salt. Spice the
same as potted mackerel, and prepare and cook the same as mackerel. More
or less oil can be used. Smelts are almost as nice as sardines.<br>

salt and pepper to taste. Put the mixture in a frying-pan, and stir over
the fire for about eight minutes, being careful not to burn. Spread
smoothly. Cover the pan and set back where the hash will brown slowly.
It will take about half an hour. When done, fold it like an omelet and
turn on to a hot dish. Garnish with points of toast and parsley. Serve
hot. If there are no cold potatoes, the same quantity of hot mashed
potatoes may be used.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Vegetable Hash.</p>
<p>Chop, not very fine, the vegetables left from a boiled dinner, and
season them with salt and pepper. To each quart of the chopped
vegetables add half a cupful of stock and one table-spoonful of butter.

pepper, and, if you like, one table-spoonful of lemon juice. Take out
the bouquet, and serve. This dish can be prepared any time in the day,
as it is quite as good warmed over as when first prepared.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Kidneys, Saut&eacute;.</p>
<p>Skin, wash and wipe the kidneys, cut in thin, round slices, and
season with salt and pepper. Put one table-spoonful of butter and half a
table-spoonful of flour in the frying-pan, and when hot, put in the
kidneys. Stir two minutes, then add half a cupful of stock or water.
When the dish boils up, add half a table-spoonful of lemon juice. Serve
with a garnish of points of toast.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Broiled Kidneys.</p>
<p>Skin, wash, wipe and split sheep's or lambs' kidneys. Run a small
skewer through each, to keep it open. Season with salt and pepper, dip

them in the double broiler and cook about six minutes over a bright
fire. Serve on a hot dish with <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> butter.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Ham and Eggs on Toast.</p>
<p>Chop fine the trimmings from cold boiled or roasted ham. Toast and
butter slices of stale bread. Spread the ham on these, and place in the
oven for about three minutes. Beat six eggs with half a cupful of milk,
a little pepper and one teaspoonful of salt. Put this mixture in a
sauce-pan with two table-spoonfuls of butter, and stir over the fire
until it begins to thicken. Take off, and beat for a moment; then spread
on the ham and toast. Serve immediately.</p>
<p><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Ham Croquettes.</span></p>
<p>One cupful of finely-chopped cooked ham, one of bread crumbs, two of
hot mashed potatoes, one large table-spoonful of butter, three eggs, a
speck of cayenne. Beat the ham, cayenne, butter, and two of the eggs
into the potato. Let the mixture cool slightly, and shape it like
croquettes. Roll in the bread crumbs, dip in beaten egg and again in
crumbs, put in the frying-basket and plunge into boiling fat. Cook two
minutes. Drain, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Canapees.</p>
<p>After cutting the crust from a loaf of stale bread, cut the loaf in
very thin slices, and toast to a delicate brown. Butter lightly, and
spread with any kind of potted meat or fish. Put two slices together,
and, with a sharp knife, cut them in long strips. Arrange these
tastefully on a dish and serve at tea or evening parties. Sardines may
be pounded to a paste and mixed with the yolks of hard-boiled eggs, also
pounded to a paste, and used instead of potted meats. In this case, the
slices of bread may be fried in salad oil.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Welsh Rare-Bit.</p>
<p>Half a pound of cheese, two eggs, a speck of cayenne, a
table-spoonful of butter, one teaspoonful of mustard, half a teaspoonful
of salt, half a cupful of cream. Break the cheese in small pieces and
put it and the other ingredients in a bright sauce-pan, which put over
boiling water. Stir until the cheese melts; then spread the mixture on
slices of crisp toast. Serve immediately. A cupful of ale or beer can be
used instead of the cream.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Welsh, Rare-Bit, No. 2.</p>
<p>Grate one pint of cheese. Sprinkle on it half a teaspoonful of

a little pepper. Cut the corn from the cobs. Mix the milk, gradually,
with the flour. Beat the yolks and whites of the eggs separately, and
add them and the other ingredients to the flour and milk. The butter
should be melted. Bake twenty minutes in two squash pie plates. This is
a dish for breakfast.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Hominy.</p>
<p>Wash a cupful of hominy in two waters; then stir it into one quart
of boiling water, with a teaspoonful of salt, and boil from thirty to
sixty minutes. The latter time is the better. Be careful that the hominy
does not burn. It can be used more than oatmeal, as it is good with any
kind of meat. It is appropriate for any meal, and is nice eaten warm or
cold with milk.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Oatmeal.</p>
<p>Oatmeal, Indian meal and hominy an require two things for
perfection--plenty of water when put on to boil, and a long time for
boiling. Have about two quarts of boiling water in a large stew-pan, and
into it stir a cupful of oatmeal, which has been wet with cold water.
Boil one hour, stirring often, and then add half a spoonful of salt, and
boil an hour longer. If it should get too stiff, add more boiling water;
or, if too thin, boil a little longer. You cannot boil too much. The
only trouble in cooking oatmeal is that it takes a long time, but surely
this should not stand in the way when it is so much better for having
the extra time. If there is not an abundance of water at first the
oatmeal will not be very good, no matter how much maybe added during the
cooking. Cracked wheat is cooked in the same way.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Strawberry Short-Cake.</p>
<p>One pint of flour, measured before sifting; one teaspoonful of cream
of tartar, half a teaspoonful of soda, one-fourth of a teaspoonful of
salt, two table-spoonfuls of sugar, four of butter, one tea-cupful of
milk. Mix the other dry ingredients with the flour, and rub through a
sieve. Rub the butter into the mixture, and add the milk. Butter two tin
squash-pie plates. Spread the mixture in them, and bake in a quick oven
from eighteen to twenty minutes. Mash one quart of strawberries with
three-fourths of a cupful of sugar. When the cakes are taken from the
oven, split and butter them, and put half of the strawberries and sugar
in each cake. Serve immediately. </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Sweet Strawberry Short-Cake.</p>
<p>Three eggs, one cupful of sugar, two of flour, one table-spoonful of
butter, one scant teaspoonful of cream of tartar, a small half
teaspoonful of soda. Beat the butter and sugar together. Add the eggs,
well beaten. Mix the soda and cream of tartar with the flour, and rub
through a sieve. Stir into the beaten egg and sugar. Bake in deep tin
plates. Four can be filled with the quantities given. Have three pints
of strawberries mixed with a cupful of sugar. Spread a layer of
strawberries on one of the cakes, lay a second cake over this, and cover
with berries. Or, a m&egrave;ringue, made with the white of an egg and a
table-spoonful of powdered sugar, may be spread over the top layer of
strawberries,<br>

<p> One quart of flour, one teaspoonful of salt, one-third of a cake of
compressed yeast, or one-third of a cupful of liquid yeast; one cupful
and a half of water. Have the water blood warm. Dissolve the yeast in
one-third of a cupful of cold water. Add it and the salt to the warm
water, and gradually stir into the flour. Beat the dough thoroughly;
cover, and let it rise in a warm place until it is spongy (about five
hours). Sprinkle the bread board with flour. Shape the dough into balls
about twice the size of an egg, and drop them on the floured board. When
all the dough has been shaped, roll the balls into cakes about one-third
of an inch thick. Lay these on a warm griddle, which has been lightly
greased, and put the griddle on the back of the stove, where there is
not much heat. When the cakes have risen a little, draw the griddle
forward and cook them slowly, turning often, to keep the flat shape. It
will take about twenty minutes for them to rise on the griddle, and
fifteen to cook. Tear them apart, butter them, and serve.</p>

place the waffles where they will keep warm until enough are cooked to
serve.</p>
<p>Many people butter the waffles as they place them on the dish, and

<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Waffles, No. 2.</p>
<p>One pint of milk, two eggs, two table-spoonfuls of butter, one

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><a name="20EGGS"></a> EGGS.</big></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Omelets.</p>
<p>There is no better form in which to serve eggs than as an omelet,
but so few people make a good omelet that that is one of the last things
the inexperienced housekeeper or cook will attempt. Yet the making is a
simple operation, the cause of failure usually being that the pan for
cooking is not hot enough, and too much egg is put in at one time. When
there is too much egg in the pan, one part will be cooked hard before
the other is heated through. A pan measuring eight inches in diameter
will cook an omelet made with four eggs; if more eggs are used, a larger
pan is necessary.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Plain Omelet.</p>
<p>Four eggs, one teaspoonful of salt, two table-spoonfuls of milk, one
table-spoonful of butter. Beat the eggs with a Dover, or any other good
egg beater, and add the salt and milk. Have the pan <i>very hot</i>.
Put in the spoonful of butter and pour in the beaten egg. Shake
vigorously on the hottest part of the stove until the egg begins to
thicken; then let it stand a few seconds to brown. Run the knife between
the sides of the omelet and the pan, fold, and turn on a <i>hot</i>
dish. Serve without delay.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Quaker Omelet.</p>
<p>A Quaker omelet is a handsome and sure dish when care is taken in
the preparation. Three eggs, half a cupful of milk, one and a half
table-spoonfuls of corn-starch, one tea-spoonful of salt, one
table-spoonful of butter. Put the omelet pan, and a cover that will fit
closely, on to heat. Beat well together the yolks of the eggs, the
corn-starch and the salt. Beat the whites to a stiff froth. Add to the
well-beaten yolks and corn-starch. Stir all together very thoroughly,
and add the milk. Put the butter in the hot pan. When melted, pour in
the mixture. Cover, and place on the stove where it will brown, but not
burn. Cook about seven minutes. Fold, turn on a hot dish, and serve with
cream sauce poured around it. If the yolks and corn-starch are
thoroughly beaten, and if, when the stiff whites are added, they are
well mixed, and the pan and cover are very hot, there can hardly be
failure.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Cheese Omelet.</p>
<p>Make the same as plain omelet, and as soon as it begins to thicken,
sprinkle in three table-spoonfuls of grated cheese.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Ham Omelet.</p>
<p>The same as plain omelet, and add three table-spoonfuls of cooked
ham, chopped rather fine, as soon as it begins to thicken.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chicken Omelet.</p>
<p>The same as plain omelet, and, just before folding, add one cupful
of cooked chicken, cut rather fine, and warmed in cream sauce.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Jelly Omelet.</p>
<p>A jelly omelet is made like the others, and, just before folding,
spread with any kind of jelly (currant or grape is the best, however).
Fold quickly, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Savory Omelet.</p>
<p>This is made like a plain omelet, with the addition of salt and one
table-spoonful of chopped parsley. A little grated onion may be used
also, if you like it.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Fish Omelet.</p>
<p>Boil a shad roe twenty minutes in salt and water. Chop it fine, and
add to it a cupful of any kind of cold fish, broken fine. Season with
salt and pepper, and warm in a cupful of cream sauce. Make a plain
omelet with six eggs. When ready to fold, spread the prepared fish on
it. Roll up, dish, and serve immediately.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Corn Omelet.</p>
<p>One pint of cold boiled corn, four eggs, half a cupful of milk, one
teaspoonful and a half of salt, a little pepper, three table-spoonfuls
of butter. Beat the eggs, and add to them the salt, pepper, milk and
corn. Fry like a plain omelet.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Baked Omelet.</p>
<p>One pint and a half of milk, four eggs, one table-spoonful of flour,
one of butter, one teaspoonful of salt. Let the milk come to a boil. Mix
the butter and flour together. Pour the boiling milk on the mixture,
which then cook five minutes, stirring all the while. Put away to cool.
When cooled, add the salt and the eggs, the yolks and whites having been
beaten separately. Pour into a buttered dish, and bake twenty minutes in
a quick oven. Serve at once. The dish should hold a little more than a
quart.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Dropped Eggs,</p>
<p>Have one quart of boiling water and one table-spoonful of salt in a
frying-pan. Break the eggs, one by one, into a saucer, and slide
carefully into the salted water. Cook until the white is firm, and lift
out with a griddle-cake turner and place on toasted bread. Serve
immediately.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Scrambled Eggs.</p>
<p>Four eggs, one table-spoonful of butter, half a teaspoonful of salt.
Beat the eggs, and add the salt to them. Melt the butter in a sauce-pan.
Turn in the beaten eggs, stir quickly over a hot fire for one minute,
and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Poached Eggs.</p>
<p>Two eggs, two table-spoonfuls of milk, half a teaspoonful of salt,
half a teaspoonful of butter. Beat the eggs, and add the salt and milk.
Put the butter in a small sauce-pan, and when it melts, add the eggs.
Stir over the fire until the mixture thickens, being careful not to let
it cook hard. About two minutes will cook it. The eggs, when done,
should be soft and creamy. Serve immediately.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Soft-boiled Eggs.</p>
<p>Place the eggs in a warm saucepan, and cover with <i>boiling</i>
water. Let them stand where they will keep hot, but <i>not</i> boil, for
ten minutes. This method will cook both whites and yolks.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Soft-boiled Eggs, No. 2.</p>
<p>Put the eggs in boiling water, and boil three minutes and a half. By
this method the white of the egg is hardened so quickly that the heat
does not penetrate to the yolk until the last minute, and consequently
the white is hard and the yolk hardly cooked enough. The first method
is, therefore, the more healthful.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Hard-boiled Eggs.</p>
<p>Put the eggs in hot water to cover, and boil twenty minutes. Ten
minutes will boil them hard, but they are not so digestible as when
boiled twenty. Ten minutes makes the yolks hard and soggy; twenty makes
them light and mealy.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Spanish Eggs.</p>
<p>Cook one cupful of rice thirty minutes in two quarts of boiling
water, to which has been added one table-spoonful of salt. Drain through
a colander, and add one table-spoonful of butter. Spread very lightly on
a hot platter. On the rice place six dropped eggs, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Eggs Sur Le Plat.</p>
<p>Little stone china dishes come expressly for this mode of serving
eggs. Heat and butter the dish, and break into it two eggs, being
careful not to break the yolks. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper,
and drop on them half a teaspoonful of butter, broken in small pieces.
Place in a moderately-hot oven until the white is set, which will be in
about five minutes. There should be a dish for each person. The flavor
can be changed by sprinkling a little finely-chopped ham or parsley on
the plate before putting in the eggs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Creamed Eggs.</p>
<p>Boil six eggs twenty minutes. Make one pint of cream sauce. Have six
slices of toast on a hot dish. Put a layer of sauce on each one, and
then part of the whites of the eggs, cut in thin strips; and rub part of
the yolks through a sieve on to the toast. Repeat this, and finish with
a third layer of sauce. Place in the oven for about three minutes.
Garnish with parsley, and serve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Stuffed Eggs.</p>
<p>Cut six hard-boiled eggs in two. Take out the yolks and mash them
fine. Add two teaspoonfuls of butter, one of cream, two or three drops
of onion juice, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix all thoroughly. Fill
the eggs from the mixture, and put them together. There will be a little
filling left, to which add a well-beaten egg. Cover the other eggs with
this last preparation, and roll in cracker crumbs. Fry in <i>boiling</i>
lard till a light brown.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Scotch Eggs.</p>
<p>One cupful of cooked lean ham, chopped very fine; one-third of a
cupful of stale bread crumbs, one-third of a cupful of milk, half a
teaspoonful of mixed mustard, cayenne enough to cover a silver five-cent
piece, one raw egg, and six hard-boiled. Cook the bread and milk
together until a smooth paste. Add to the ham, and add the seasoning and
raw egg. Mix thoroughly. Break the shells from the hard-boiled eggs, and
cover with this mixture. Put in a frying basket, and plunge into boiling
fat for two minutes. These are nice for lunch, tea, or picnics.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Eggs, Brouill&eacute;.</p>
<p>Six eggs, half a cupful of milk, or, better still, of cream; two
mushrooms, one teaspoonful of salt, a little pepper, three
table-spoonfuls of butter, a slight grating of nutmeg. Cut the mushrooms
into dice, and fry them for one minute in one table-spoonful of the
butter. Beat the eggs, salt, pepper, and cream together, and put them in
a saucepan. Add the butter and mushrooms to these ingredients. Stir
over a moderate heat until the mixture begins to thicken. Take from the
fire and beat rapidly until the eggs become quite thick and creamy. Have
slices of toast on a hot dish. Heap the mixture on these, and garnish
with points of toast. Serve immediately.<br>

ECONOMICAL DISHES.</big></big></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Calf's Liver, Braised.</p>
<p>Wash and wipe a calf's liver. Lard one side of it. Cover the bottom
of the braising pan with slices of salt pork, using about a quarter of a
pound. Cut an onion and half a carrot in small pieces, and spread over
the pork. Lay the liver on this, and dredge thickly with salt, pepper
and flour. Cover the pan, and place where it will cook slowly for half
an hour. Add a bouquet of sweet herbs and three pints of stock or water.
Put the pan in a moderate oven and cook for two hours. Baste frequently
with the gravy in the pan, and salt, pepper and flour. About twenty
minutes before the liver is done, add one teaspoonful of vinegar and one
of lemon juice. Strain the gravy over the liver when it is dished.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Beef Stew.</p>
<p>Take the bones and hard, tough parts left from a roast of beef.
Remove all the meat from the bones, and cut it in small pieces. Cut
about a quarter of a pound of the fat of the meat in very small pieces.
Put it in the stew-pan to fry. When it begins to brown, put in half a
carrot, one small turnip, and two onions, cut fine. Stir over the fire
for ten minutes. Take out the fat and vegetables, and put the bones in
the bottom of the kettle. Add the meat and the cooked vegetables, but
not the fat. Dredge well with salt, pepper, and flour, shaking in at
least half a cupful of flour. Add three pints of water, and simmer
gently one hour; then put in six potatoes, pared and cut in slices.
Simmer one hour longer. Taste to see if seasoned enough. Draw forward
where it will boil more rapidly. Stir the stew, and put in the
dumplings. Cook just ten minutes. The cover of the stew-pan must fit
tightly. There should be about two pounds of meat for this stew, not
counting the bones.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Cold Meat with Pur&eacute;e of Potato.</p>
<p>Six good-sized potatoes, one table-spoonful of butter, one cupful of
boiling milk, salt and pepper to taste. Pare and boil the potatoes, and
mash light and fine. Add the butter, seasoning and boiling milk. Beat up
light, and spread on a hot platter. Lay on this handsome slices of any
kind of cold meat, and on each slice put a table-spoonful of hot gravy.
Put a little gravy around the dish, and set in the oven for five
minutes. Garnish with parsley, and serve. If there is no gravy left from
the dinner of the day before, make a pint in the following manner: Put a
quart of water with some of the hard pieces and bones of the meat, and
boil down to one pint. Put one table-spoonful of butter in a frying-pan,
and, when hot, add one table-spoonful of flour. Stir until dark brown,
and strain the broth on this. Season with salt, pepper and, if you
please, one spoonful of Halford sauce.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Shepherds' Pie.</p>
<p>One quart of any kind of cold meat, eight large potatoes, one small
onion, one cupful of boiling milk, salt, pepper, and nearly a pint of
gravy or stock, thickened with one table-spoonful of flour. Season the
meat and put in a deep earthen dish. Grate the onion into the gravy, and
pour over the meat. Pare, boil and mash the potatoes. Add the salt,
pepper and milk and one table-spoonful of butter. Cover the pie with
this, and bake gently half an hour.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Shepherds' Pie, No. 2.</p>
<p>Cut into dice one quart of any kind of cold meat. Mince very fine
two table-spoonfuls of salt pork, and add to the meat. Pare and cut into
dice four large uncooked potatoes; grate or chop fine one onion; chop
fine one table-spoonful of parsley. Mix, and season well with salt and
pepper, and add a large cupful of water. Put in a deep earthen dish.
Make a paste with four potatoes, two table-spoonfuls of butter, a large
cupful of boiling milk and a pint of flour. Pare, boil and mash the
potatoes; then add butter, salt and milk. When all is very light, beat
in the flour, gradually. Sprinkle the board with flour, and roll the
paste a little larger than the dish. Make a hole in the centre, to let
out the air. Cover the dish with the paste, being careful to have the
edge come inside the dish. Bake gently one hour.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Escaloped Meat.</p>
<p>Chop the meat rather coarse. Season with salt and pepper. For one
pint of meat use half a cupful of gravy and a heaping cupful of bread
crumbs. Put a layer of the meat in an escalop dish, then gravy, then a
thin layer of crumbs; and continue this until the dish is full. The last
layer should be a thick one of crumbs. Cook in a hot oven from fifteen
to twenty minutes. All kinds of cold meat can be escaloped, but beef is
so dry that it is not so good as mutton, veal, etc,</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Curry of Cold Meat.</p>
<p>Three table-spoonfuls of butter, three teaspoonfuls of flour, one
onion, one teaspoonful of curry powder, salt, pepper, one generous pint
of stock or water, about two pounds of any kind of cold meat, cut in
thin slices. Put the butter in the frying-pan, and, when hot, add the
onion. When the onion turns yellow, add the flour and curry powder. Stir
two minutes, add the stock or water, simmer five minutes, and strain on
the meat. Simmer all together for ten minutes. Serve with a border of
rice or mashed potatoes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Barley Stew.</p>
<p>About a quarter of a pound of cold roasted or broiled meat, two
onions, four potatoes, a quarter of a cupful of barley, one
table-spoonful of flour, one quart of water, and salt and pepper to
taste. Cut the meat into dice; wash the barley; cut the onions <i>very
fine</i>. Put all in a stew-pan, and dredge with the flour, half a
table-spoonful of salt, and one-eighth of a teaspoonful of pepper. Add
the water, and simmer two hours. Pare and slice the potatoes. Add them
to the stew, and simmer one hour longer. Taste to see if there is
enough, salt and pepper, and if there is not, add more.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Dumplings.</p>
<p>One pint of flour, measured before sifting; half a teaspoonful of
soda, a teaspoonful of cream of tartar, one of sugar, half a teaspoonful
of salt. Mix all thoroughly and run through the sieve. Wet with a small
cupful of milk. Sprinkle a little flour on the board. Turn the dough
(which should have been stirred into a smooth ball with a spoon) on it
roll to the thickness of half an inch, cut into small cakes, and cook
ten minutes.</p>
<p>By remembering that the soup should be boiling rapidly when the
dumplings are put in; that they should not sink too deep in it; that
they should boil <i>just ten minutes</i>; that the cover should fit
tightly, so that the steam shall not escape; and that the pot boils all
the time, so that the steam is kept up; and by following the other
directions, success is insured.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><big><a name="BREAD"></a> BREAD.</big></big></p>
<p>When you put the bread on the board, pat it lightly. Do not <i>press
down</i>, but let all motions be as elastic as possible. Knead with the <i>palm</i>
until the dough is a flat cake, and then fold. Keep doing this until the
dough is light and smooth and will not stick to the board or hands. Use
as little flour as possible in kneading. Do not stop until you have
fully finished, for bread that has "rested" is not good. Milk can be
used instead of water in mixing. It should always be first scalded, and
then allowed to cool to blood heat. One table-spoonful of lard or butter
makes the bread tenderer when water is used.</p>
<p>In cold weather some kitchens grow cold very quickly after the fire
is out. In this case the bread should be made earlier in the evening,
and set in a warmer place (about eighty or ninety degrees); because if
it begins to rise within the first two hours, it will continue to rise,
unless the temperature falls to the freezing point. The reason for
letting the rolls rise longer than the loaves is that the former, being
smaller, are penetrated by heat much more quickly than the loaves are,
and, of course, fermentation is stopped sooner; therefore, the rolls do
not rise as much in the oven as the loaves.</p>
<p>Rolls should be made into smooth little balls, and should be placed
in even rows in a shallow pan. Breakfast rolls, are first made into
little balls and then rolled between the hands until three inches long.
They are placed close together in even rows in the pan. Dinner and
French rolls, after being made into little balls, are put on a
well-floured board, and a little, well-floured rolling-pin, two and a
half inches in diameter, is pressed nearly through their centre. The
rolls are to be so placed in pans as not to touch each other. Being so
small, and baking so quickly, they have a sweet taste of the wheat.</p>
<p>The best-sized pan for loaves is made of block tin; is eight and a
half inches long, four and a half wide, and three deep. Those for wheat
bread should be greased very slightly with either butter or lard. For
rye, Indian, or Graham, they must be greased thoroughly, as the dough
clings more to the tins. There are many kinds of bread that can be made
readily and safely after once learning to make good common bread. It is
difficult to give exact rules for flour, as it varies, some kinds
requiring much more water than others. The "new process" flour has so
much more starch, and packs so much more closely than the "old process,"
that one-eighth less is required, or one-eighth more of liquid; but if
the flour is weighed, the same amount of water is taken for a pound of
flour made by either process. The best flour is always the cheapest for
bread. As there is no one article of food of so great importance for the
health and happiness of the family as bread, make it as nearly perfect
as possible.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Yeast.</p>
<p>Put two quarts of water and two table-spoonfuls of hops on to boil.
Pare and grate six large potatoes. When the hops and water <i>boil</i>,
strain the water on the grated potatoes, and stir well. Place on the
stove and boil up once. Add half a cupful of sugar and one-fourth of a
cupful of salt. Let the mixture get blood warm; then add one cupful of
yeast, or one cake of compressed yeast, and let it rise in a warm place
five or six hours. When well risen, turn into a stone jug. Cork this
tightly, and set in a cool place. As poor yeast is the chief cause of
poor bread, pains should be taken to make yeast properly and to keep it
well. It must never be allowed to stand in a warm room after it has
risen, and the jug in which it is kept should be carefully washed and <i>scalded</i>
each time the yeast is renewed. As much care must be taken with the
stopper as with the jug. When it is convenient to get fresh cakes of
Fleischmann's compressed yeast, it will be much better and cheaper to
use them than to make your own. This yeast is wholly free of any
injurious substance, and with it good bread can always be made, provided
the flour is good and the rules are followed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Yeast Bread, No. 1.</p>
<p>With these materials two loaves can be made: Two quarts of flour,
half a cupful of yeast, nearly a pint and a half of water, half a
table-spoonful each of lard, sugar, and salt. Sift the flour into a
bread-pan, and, after taking out a cupful for use in kneading, add the
salt, sugar, yeast, and the water, which must be about blood warm (or,
say one hundred degrees, if in cold weather, and about eighty in the hot
season). Beat well with a strong spoon. When well mixed, sprinkle a
little flour on the board, turn out the dough on this, and knead from
twenty to thirty minutes. Put back in the pan. Hold the lard in the hand
long enough to have it very soft. Rub it over the dough. Cover closely,
that neither dust nor air can get in, and set in a warm place. It will
rise in eight or nine hours. In the morning shape into loaves or rolls.
If into loaves, let these rise an hour where the temperature is between
ninety and one hundred degrees; if into rolls, let these rise an hour
and a half. Bake in an oven that will brown a teaspoonful of flour in
five minutes. (The flour used for this test should be put on a bit of
crockery, as it will have a more even heat.) The loaves will need from
forty-five to sixty minutes to bake, but the rolls will be done in half
an hour if placed close together in the pan; and if French rolls are
made, they will bake in fifteen minutes. As soon as baked, the bread
should be taken out of the pans and placed on a table where it can rest
against something until cool. It should then be put in a stone pot or
tin box, which has been thoroughly washed, scalded and dried, and be set
away in a cool, dry place.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Yeast Bread, No. 2.</p>
<p>One cupful of Indian meal, two quarts of flour, one pint and a half
of boiling water, one table-spoonful of sugar, one teaspoonful of salt,
half a cake of compressed yeast. Pour the boiling water on the Indian
meal. Stir well, and set away to cool. When blood warm, add the yeast,
salt and sugar to it. Stir this mixture into the flour, and proceed as
for yeast bread, No. I.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Bread Made with Dried Yeast.</p>
<p>Two quarts of flour, one yeast-cake, one generous pint of water,
blood warm; one table-spoonful of sugar, one of butter, one teaspoonful
of salt. Dissolve the yeast in the water, and stir gradually into one
pint of the flour. Set in a warm place for two hours. It will then be
risen to a sponge. Stir it into the remainder of the flour. Knead well,
and put in a warm place to rise. It will rise in about five hours if the
heat is about seventy-five or eighty degrees. Or, it will rise during
the night in a heat of sixty degrees. In the morning treat like yeast
bread, No. I.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Sticks.</p>
<p>Four cupfuls of flour, one table-spoonful of sugar, one-fourth of a
cupful of butter, one cupful of boiled milk, the white of an egg,
one-fourth of a cake of compressed yeast, one scant teaspoonful of salt.
Dissolve the butter in the milk, which have blood warm. Beat the white
of the egg to a stiff froth. Dissolve the yeast in three table-spoonfuls
of cold water. Add all the other ingredients to the flour, and knead
well. Let the dough rise over night, and in the morning make into balls
about the size of a large English walnut. Roll each of these balls into
a stick about a foot long. Use the moulding board. Place the sticks
about two inches apart in long pans. Let them rise half an hour in a
cool place, and bake twenty-five minutes in a very moderate oven.
Sticks should be quite dry and crisp. They cannot be if baked rapidly.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Graham Bread.</p>
<p>With this material two loaves or two dozen muffins can be made: One
pint of water or milk, one of flour, one <i>large</i> pint of Graham,
half a cupful of yeast, half a cupful of sugar, one teaspoonful of salt.
Have the milk or water blood warm, and add the yeast. Sift the flour
into a deep dish. Add the milk and yeast, gradually, and beat until
wholly smooth. Set in a rather cool place (about sixty degrees) to rise
over night. In the morning add the salt and sugar and then the Graham, a
little at a time, beating vigorously all the while. When thoroughly
beaten, turn into pans, and let it rise an hour in a temperature of from
90&deg; to 100&deg;. Bake an hour. </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Togus Bread.</p>
<p>Three cupfuls of sweet milk and one of sour, three cupfuls of Indian
meal and one of flour, half a cupful of molasses, one teaspoonful of
saleratus, one of salt. Steam three hours.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Brown Bread.</p>
<p>One cupful of rye meal, one of Indian meal, one of molasses, two of
flour, one pint and a half of sour milk, a teaspoonful of soda, an egg,
one teaspoonful of salt. Mix the dry ingredients together. Dissolve the
soda in two table-spoonfuls of boiling water. Add it and the milk to the
molasses. Stir well, and pour on the other mixed ingredients. Beat the
egg and add it. Mix thoroughly, and pour into a well-buttered tin pan
that holds two quarts. Steam four hours, and then put in the oven for
half an hour.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><big><a name="DRINKS"></a> DRINKS.</big></big></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Cocoa.</p>
<p>Cocoa is rich in nutritive elements. Like milk, it has all the
substances necessary for the growth and sustenance of the body. It is
the fruit of a small tree that grows in Mexico, Central America, the
West Indies and other islands. The fruit is in shape like a large, thick
cucumber, and contains from six to thirty beans. There is a number of
forms in which it is sold in the market, the most convenient and
nutritious being chocolate. Next comes cocoa, then cocoa nibs, and
lastly cocoa shells. The beans of the cocoa are roasted in the same
manner as coffee. The husks or shells are taken off and the beans then
ground between hot rollers. Sometimes the husks are not removed, but
ground with the bean. The ground bean is called cocoa; and mixed with
sugar, after being ground very fine, is termed chocolate. Vanilla is
often added as a flavor. Sometimes the cocoa is mixed with starch. When
the bean is broken in small pieces, these are called nibs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> To Make Cocoa.</p>
<p>Put a gill of the broken cocoa in a pot with two quarts of water,
and boil gently three hours. There should be a quart of liquid in the
pot when done. If the boiling has been so rapid that there is not this
quantity, add more water, and let it boil once again. Many people prefer
half broken cocoa and half shells. If the stomach is delicate, this is
better than all cocoa. Sugar and milk are used, as with coffee.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Shells.</p>
<p>Use twice the quantity of shells that you would of broken cocoa, and
boil twice as long.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Chocolate.</p>
<p>Scrape fine an ounce (one of the small squares) of Baker's or any
other plain chocolate. Add two table-spoonfuls of sugar, and put in a
small saucepan with a table-spoonful of hot water. Stir over a hot fire
for a minute or two, until it is perfectly smooth and glossy, and then
stir it all into a quart of boiling milk, or half milk and half water.
Mix thoroughly, and serve at once. If the chocolate is wanted richer,
take twice as much chocolate, sugar, and water. Made in this way,
chocolate is perfectly smooth, and free of oily particles. If it is
allowed to boil after the chocolate is added to the milk, it becomes
oily and loses its fine flavor.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Coffee.</p>
<p>There is a variety of coffees; but, unlike the teas, they do not owe
their difference of flavor or color to the curing, but to the soil and
climate in which they grow. Coffee grows on small trees. The fruit is
something like the cherry, but there are two seeds in it. The beans are
separated by being bruised with a heavy roller, and are then washed and
dried. The longer the raw berry is kept the riper and better flavored it
becomes. In countries where coffee is grown the leaves are used as much
as the berry. Like tea, coffee must be roasted, that the fine flavor
shall be developed. There are large establishments for roasting and
grinding coffee. The work is done by machinery; and nearly always the
grains arc evenly roasted, and just enough to give the right flavor. If
the coffee, after roasting, is put in close tin cans, it will retain its
best qualities for a long time. It can be ground when needed for use.
Many persons think that heating the dry coffee just before making
improves the flavor. There are many modes of making coffee, each having
its advantages and disadvantages. Some people think that by first
wetting the coffee with cold water, and letting it come to a boil, and
by then adding the boiling water, more of the strength of the coffee is
extracted. When there is not cream for coffee the milk should be boiled,
as it makes the coffee richer. As soon as the milk boils up it should be
taken off of the stove, since it grows strong and oily by much boiling.
To many people it is injurious to drink coffee; but physicians say that,
taken without milk, it is harmless. Some element of the coffee combines
with the milk to form a leathery coating on the stomach, which impairs
digestion. A great many substances are mixed with coffee, when sold, to
cheapen it,--chicory, beans, peas, rye, and wheat being the commonest.
To obtain it pure, the safest way is to buy it unground, unless you
purchase of a strictly honest dealer. Coffee drinkers, as a rule, eat
less than other people, though coffee, and also tea, have little direct
food value; but they retard the waste of the tissues, and so take the
place of food. The sugar and milk used with them give some nutriment.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Boiled Coffee.</p>
<p>The old method of boiling coffee is still practised by at least
one-half the housekeepers in this country. The coffee is sometimes
boiled with an egg, which makes it perfectly clear, and also enriches
it. When an egg is not used a small piece of salt fish skin is boiled
with the coffee to clear it.</p>
<p>Directions for making: A small cupful of roasted and ground coffee,
one-third Mocha and two-thirds Java; a small egg, shell and all, broken
into the pot with the dry coffee. Stir veil with a spoon, and then pour
on three pints of boiling water. Let it boil from five to ten minutes,
counting from the time it begins to boil. As soon as it has boiled
enough, pour in a cupful of cold water, and turn a little of the coffee
into a cup, to see that the nozzle of the pot is not filled with
grounds. Turn this back, and let the coffee stand a few moments to
settle, taking care that it does not boil again. The advantages of
boiled coffee are that when the egg is used the yolk gives a very rich
flavor, and when the milk or cream is added the coffee has a rich,
yellow look, which is pleasing. It has also a peculiar flavor, which
many people prefer to the flavor gained by any other process. The
disadvantages are that the egg coats the dry coffee, and when the hot
water is added the coating becomes hard, and a great deal of the best of
the coffee remains in the grounds after boiling. Also, in boiling, much
of the fine flavor is lost in the steam that escapes from the pot.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Filtered Coffee.</p>
<p>Another--and really the most economical and the easiest--way of
making coffee is by filtering. The French coffee biggin is valuable for
this. It consists of two cylindrical tin vessels, one fitting into
another, and the bottom of the upper being a fine strainer. Another
coarser strainer, with a rod running from the centre, is placed upon
this. Then the coffee, which must be finely-ground, is put in, and
another strainer is placed at the top of the rod. The boiling water is
poured on, and the pot set where it will keep hot, but not boil, until
the water has gone through. This will make a clear, strong coffee, with
a rich, smooth flavor. The advantage of the two extra strainers is that
the one coming next to the fine strainer prevents the grounds from
filling up the fine holes, and so the coffee is clear, and made more
easily. The upper strainer causes the boiling water to fall on the
coffee like rain. In this way it is more evenly distributed, and the
fine coffee is not carried through the fine strainer, as it would be if
the water were poured directly on the dry coffee. When milk or cream is
added to filtered coffee it does not turn a rich yellow, as in the case
of that boiled with an egg. A few spoonfuls of this coffee, without
sugar or milk, taken after dinner, is said to help digestion.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Vienna Coffee.</p>
<p>A quartet of a cupful of boiled milk. Add three table-spoonfuls of
whipped cream, and fill up with filtered coffee.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Caf&eacute; au Lait.</p>
<p>This is simply one pint of filtered coffee added to one pint of milk
that has come just to the boiling point.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Steamed Coffee.</p>
<p>Another mode of preparing coffee is to steam it. The coffee is put
in a pot and boiling water poured on it. This pot, which is made to fit
into a tea-kettle, is placed in the kettle, and the coffee is cooked
from ten to twenty minutes, the water in the kettle boiling all the
time. This will make a clear and delicious drink.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Tea.</p>
<p>There are three varieties of the tea plant; both black and green tea
can be prepared from them all. Green tea is made from leaves which are
dried quickly, and black from leaves which have first been allowed to
stand twelve hours or more before roasting. The leaves wilt and grow
moist in that time, and that is what gives the dark and peculiar
appearance to this tea. In making tea the pot should be earthen, rinsed
with boiling water and left to stand a few moments on the stove, to dry.
Put in the tea leaves, and let the pot stand a few minutes longer. Pour
on boiling water, leaving the pot standing where it will be at the
boiling point, yet will not boil, for from three to five minutes. For
moderate strength use one teaspoonful of tea to half a pint of water. If
the water is soft it should be used as soon as it boils, for boiling
causes all the gases which flavor the water to escape; but if the water
is hard it is best to boil from twenty to thirty minutes. The gases
escape from hard water also, but boiling causes the mineral matter,
which hardens the water, to settle on the bottom of the kettle, and the
water becomes softer.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Lemonade.</p>
<p>Good lemonade can be made with half a pint of lemon juice (extracted
with a squeezer, and strained), three pints of water and a generous pint
of sugar. Have the drink cold. Hot lemonade is highly recommended for a
cold. A glass can be made with the juice of a lemon, one large
table-spoonful of sugar and a cupful of boiling water. Drink it hot.<br>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"> To Blanch Almonds.</p>
<p>Shell the nuts, and pour boiling water over them. Let them stand in
the water a minute, and then throw them into cold water. Rub between the
hands.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> To Corn Beef.</p>
<p>For fifty pounds of beef make a pickle with two gallons of water,
four pounds of salt, one and a half pounds of brown sugar, one and a
half ounces of saltpetre, half an ounce of saleratus. Put these
ingredients on to boil, and when they boil, skim, and put away to cool.
When cold, put the beef in it. Put weights on the meat, to keep it under
the brine.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> To Scrape Chocolate.</p>
<p>If only one square of chocolate is needed, draw a line across the
two squares at the end, dividing them in halves. With a sharp knife,
shave off the chocolate until you come to the line. By this method there
is no waste of time or material. If you want two or more squares, all
that is necessary is, of course, to shave off until you come to the
dividing line already there. The pound packages of Baker's chocolate
consist of two cakes, each of which has eight squares; so one of these
squares is an ounce.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> To Use the Salamander.</p>
<p>The salamander is a circular iron plate, to which is attached a long
handle. It is made red hot in the fire and held over the article to be
browned, being careful not to have it touch. If you have not a
salamander the fire shovel can be heated and used in the same way; but
the shovel is not improved by the operation.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> To Clean English Currants.</p>
<p>Pick all the stones, bits of dirt and long stems from the currants.
Add one pint of flour to two quarts of currants, and rub well between
the hands. This starts the stems and dirt from the fruit. Put about a
pint of currants in the flour sieve and rub them until all the flour has
passed through; then put them in the colander and shake until the stems
have passed through. When all the fruit has been treated in this manner,
put it in a large pan of cold water. Wash thoroughly, and drain in the
colander. Repeat this operation three times. When the fruit is well
drained, spread it on boards or flat dishes and dry in a warm place. Put
away in jars.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> To Remove Jellies and Creams from Moulds.</p>
<p>Have in a pan water enough (a little more than blood warm) to come
to the top of the mould. If the mould is tin, set it in this for about
half a minute; if earthen, keep it in long enough to have the heat pass
through the mould. Wipe the mould, place over it the dish into which the
jelly is to be turned, and turn both dish and mould simultaneously. Let
the mould rest a moment before lifting it gently from the jelly.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> To Whip Cream.</p>
<p>Very rich or <i>very</i> poor cream will not whip well. When too
rich it turns to butter, and when too poor the froth becomes liquid
almost as soon as it has been skimmed. Thick cream, that will hardly
pour, should have an equal quantity of milk added to it before whipping.
Such cream as one gets from the milkman will rarely be found <i>too</i>
rich for whipping. It is more likely to be the other way; and one is
often disappointed in finding it too poor to froth. The cream should be
ice cold.</p>
<p>Have a large bowl or tin pail, rather narrow at the bottom. Place
this in a pan of ice water. Have a bright tin pan in another of ice
water. Put the cream in the bowl and put the whip churn in this. Hold
the churn with the left hand, tipping it slightly, that the cream may
flow out at the bottom. With the right hand draw the dasher lightly
about half way up the cylinder; then press down hard. It must not be
forgotten that the <i>up</i> stroke is <i>light</i> and the <i>down</i>
stroke is <i>hard</i>. When the bowl is full, skim the froth into a tin
pan. Continue this until nearly all the cream has been whipped. Draw the
froth in the pan to one side, and turn the liquid cream at the bottom of
the pan back into the bowl. Whip it again. A little of the cream will
always become liquid again.</p>
<p>When the cream is for whips, or for a garnish for frozen pudding or
Bavarian creams, sweeten it, and flavor with anything you please, before
whipping. If the cream is very rich a Dover beater will whip it, but
there is nothing that will whip cream so quickly and so well as the whip
churn described in the chapter on Kitchen Furnishing.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> To Boil Sugar.</p>
<p>The degrees of boiling sugar are variously divided by different
cooks. Some give six and others as high as eight. The Stench boil sugar
for nearly all their desserts. For all practical purposes a cook need
understand only three stages. Put one cupful of granulated or loaf sugar
and half a cupful of water on to boil. When the mixture has boiled
fifteen minutes, dip the fore-finger and thumb in cold water and take up
a little of the syrup between them. If, upon drawing them apart, the
syrup forms a thread, it is at the second degree. This is the best stage
for frozen fruits, sherbets, and preserves.</p>
<p>If, a little later, when some syrup is taken up with a spoon and
blown hard, it flies off in tiny bubbles, it is at the fourth degree,
called the <i>souffl&eacute;</i>. It takes about twenty minutes'
boiling for this. The syrup is then used for <i>biscuit glac&eacute;</i>
and various kinds of creams. At this stage it also gives sherbets and
fruits a much richer flavor than when used at the second degree.</p>
<p>If, when a little syrup is taken up on the point of a stick or
skewer, and dipped in cold water, it breaks off brittle, the sixth
degree has been reached. This is the stage where it is used for icing
fruit and cake, the dish being called fruit <i>glac&eacute;</i> or <i>g&acirc;teau
glac&eacute;</i>. The syrup must <i>never</i> be stirred, as this will
cause it to grain. Great care must be taken that it does not boil after
coming to the sixth degree, as it burns quickly after that point is
reached.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">To Make and Use a Pastry Bag.</p>
<p>Fold a piece of strong cotton cloth (perhaps a foot square) from the
opposite corners, so as to give it a triangular shape. On one side sew
together the two edges, thus making a bag shaped like a "dunce's cap."
Cut the cloth at the apex just enough to permit a short tin tube,
somewhat like a tailor's thimble, to be pushed through. The tube for
&eacute;clairs measures about three-fourths of an inch at the smallest
opening; that for lady-fingers is three-eighths of an inch, and that for
meringues and kisses, half an inch. The tubes for decorating with
frosting are very small.</p>
<p>Fill the bag with the mixture to be forced through, and gather the
cloth together at the top with the left hand. Hold the point of the tube
close to the pan on which the mixture is to be spread. Press the mixture
out with the right hand. If the cakes are to be large use a good deal of
pressure, but if to be small, very little will do. At first, it will be
hard to get the shapes, but with a little practice it will seem
comparatively easy.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> To Make Paper Cases.</p>
<p>This is not difficult, if one will carefully study for a moment the
diagram below and the directions following:</p>
<p></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="Images/paperbox.png"
 title="Paper Case" alt="Paper Case"
 style="width: 457px; height: 454px;"><br>
</div>
<p> Cut the paper on the dark lines--(there are <i>eight</i>).</p>
<p>Crease on every dotted line.</p>
<p>At each end turn the parts lettered A over that lettered B, so that
the lines <i>c</i> rest on the line <i>d</i>, and one A overlaps the
other.</p>
<p>Fold the parts B up against the backs of the parts A.</p>
<p>Fold inward those parts of the edges which are lightly shaded, and
fold outward those which are heavily shaded.</p>
<p>Stick the parts of the box together with the white of an egg mixed
with a little flour.</p>
<p>Remember that it is a box that is to be made, and after the first
two steps it may be easy to guess how to complete the work. By tracing a
copy of the diagram one obtains a good model one quarter of the size the
case should be; that is, the square should be five inches on a side
instead of two and one-half. After experimenting with this the shape may
be varied to suit the taste. Stiff white paper should be used. Cases can
be bought of restaurateurs. They are used for <i>biscuit glac&eacute;,
biscuit souffl&eacute;,</i> and other dainties.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> To Lard.</p>
<p>Larding is a simple operation. The pork should be firm and young
(salt, of course). Cut thin, even slices parallel with the rind, and cut
these in long, narrow strips that will fit into the needle. For beef,
veal, turkey or chicken the strips should be about as large round as a
lead pencil, and about three and a half inches long; and for birds,
chops, and sweetbreads they should be about as large round as a match.
Three slices are all that can be cut from one piece of pork, because
when you get more than an inch away from the rind, the pork is so tender
that it will break when in the needle.</p>
<p>Put the strips in a bowl of broken ice, to harden. Have the meat, if
beef or veal, free of skin and gristle. Put a strip (also called a
lardoon) into the needle as far as it will go. With a skewer or knife
draw a line on both sides of the meat and along the upper part. Thrust
the needle into the meat at one of the side lines; and when it is about
half way through to the top of the piece, press the steel slightly with
the thumb and fore-finger, to hold the lardoon in place until it has
entered the meat. Now push the needle through to the top, and gently
draw it out, leaving about three-quarters of an inch of the strip
exposed at both the side and upper part of the meat That part of the
pork which is hidden should be half an inch under the surface. The
needle's course is as if it started under the eaves of a gable roof and
came out at the ridge-pole. Continue until all the rows are filled with
lardoons. Two rows are enough for a fillet of beef. If the strips are
too large for the needle they will be pressed out as soon as the lower
part of the needle enters the meat.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> To Stew.</p>
<p>The meat and vegetables for stews should, when it is possible, be
browned in a little fat, and hot water should then be added. As soon as
the stew comes to the boiling point, skim it, and set back where it will
just simmer, not boil, the given time. The pieces of meat in a stew
should come to the table whole and tender and juicy, and they will be in
this condition only with <i>slow</i> cooking.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> To Braise.</p>
<p>Braising is one of the best modes of preparing meat. There are pans
expressly for braising; but any deep tin, sheet-iron, or granite-ware
pan, with a cover, will answer quite well. The meat to be cooked must
always be browned in some kind of fat, the vegetables fried in the same
fat, and enough stock (if possible) or water be added to half cover the
meat. The pan should then be covered and placed in the oven. The meat
must cook <i>slowly</i> and thoroughly, and be basted frequently. No
matter how tough, if properly braised it will become tender and juicy.
If, however, the cooking is hurried the dish will be spoiled.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> To Fry.</p>
<p>There are two modes of frying. One is to have just enough fat to
prevent the article from burning or sticking; and the other is to have
enough not only to cover the food, but to float it. The latter is by far
the better way, as all the surface of the article is instantly hardened,
and, therefore, will not absorb fat. It is also the cheaper way, because
the fat can be used so many times. If the drippings saved from meats,
soups and gravies should not be enough for frying purposes, buy pure
lard to use with it. Many recommend buying beef suet for this same
purpose; but food fried in suet is more liable to absorb fat than that
fried in lard. The reason of this is that lard can be heated to a higher
temperature without burning than can beef or any of the other fats.
Butter is also often recommended for frying. If used, it should be free
of salt. But aside from being so expensive, it is not so nice for frying
purposes as fats, for it burns at a much lower temperature than either
beef fat or lard. The Scotch kettle is the <i>best</i> utensil for
frying. It rests on a rim, which lifts the bottom from the stove, and
the inside surface is polished very smooth; therefore, the fat is less
liable to burn than if the surface were rough and the bottom rested on
the hot stove. The fat should heat gradually; and when the food is
plunged into it a slight smoke should rise from the <i>centre.</i> It
will smoke at the sides some time before it has become hot enough for
frying. After the food has been put in, let the kettle stand on the
hottest part of the stove until it regains its former temperature, and
then set it back where it is not quite so hot. In frying fish-balls,
doughnuts, etc., put only a few at a time in the boiling fat; then wait
a few moments for the fat to regain its former temperature, and put in a
few more. Fish-balls are often spoiled by the putting of a great many in
the kettle at once. The temperature of the fat is instantly reduced, and
the balls absorb the fat. When an article of food is fried, drain the
fat from it, and lay it on a sheet of brown paper in a warm pan. The
paper will absorb any fat that may remain on the food. As soon as you
are through frying, take the fat from the fire, and when cooled a
little, strain it, (See the chapter on the Care of Food.) If the
directions given are followed, there will be no difficulty in having
food fried without its being saturated with grease.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> To Serve.</p>
<p>The dishes on which meats, fish, jellies and creams are placed
should be large enough to leave a margin of an inch or so between the
food and the lower edge of the border of the dish.</p>
<p>It is well to pour the sauce for cold puddings around the pudding,
especially if there will be a contrast in color.</p>
<p>It is a great improvement to have the sauce poured around the
article instead of over it, and to have the border of the dish garnished
with bits of parsley, celery tops or carrot leaves.</p>
<p>When sauce is poured around meat or fish the dish must be quite hot,
or the sauce will cool quickly.</p>
<p>Small rolls or sticks of bread are served with soup. Potatoes and
bread are usually served with fish, but many people prefer to serve only
bread. Butter is not served at the more elegant dinners. Two vegetables
will be sufficient in any course. Cold dishes should be very cold, and
hot dishes <i>hot.</i></p>
<p>It is a good idea to have a dish of sliced lemons for any kind of
fish, and especially for those broiled or fried.</p>
<p>Melons, cantelopes, cucumbers and radishes, and tomatoes, when
served in slices, should all be chilled in the ice chest.</p>
<p>Be particular not to overdo the work of decorating. Even a simple
garnish adds much to the appearance of a dish, but too much decoration
only injures it. Garnishes should be so arranged as not to interfere
with serving.</p>
<p>Potato-balls and thin fried potatoes make a nice garnish for all
kinds of fried and broiled meats and fish.</p>
<p>Cold boiled beets, carrots and turnips, and the whites of
hard-boiled eggs, stamped out with a fancy vegetable cutter, make a
pretty garnish for cold or hot meats.</p>
<p>Thin slices of toast, cut into triangles, make a good garnish for
many dishes.</p>
<p>Whipped cream is a delicate garnish for all Bavarian dreams,
blanc-manges, frozen puddings and ice creams.</p>
<p>Arrange around jellies or creams a border of any kind of delicate
green, like smilax or parsley, or of rose leaves, and dot it with bright
colors--pinks, geraniums, verbenas or roses. Remember that the green
should be dark and the flowers small and bright. A bunch of artificial
rose leaves, for decorating dishes of fruit at evening parties, lasts
for years. Natural leaves are preferable when they can be obtained.</p>
<p>Wild roses, buttercups and nasturtiums, if not used too freely, we
suitable for garnishing a salad.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><big><a name="BILLS"></a> BILLS OF
FARE.</big></big></p>
<p>What to set before guests at the table, or, indeed, before one's own
family, is sometimes a perplexing matter for housekeepers to decide, and
a few bills of fare are given on the following pages as an aid. The
number of dishes can readily be increased or diminished. Any of the
company dinners can be prepared at home almost as easily as an ordinary
dinner, success depending not upon a great number of dishes, but upon a
few well cooked and well served, and a hostess apparently free from care.</p>
<p>A great part of any company dinner can be prepared the day before.
The vegetables can be prepared and put in cold water, the game or meat
be larded, the meat or fish cooked for croquettes and salads, the salad
dressing made ready, and jellies, creams and cold puddings be made. If a
clear soup (and that is always best) is to be served, it also should be
made. In the morning the bread and cake can be baked, and the fish and
other dishes prepared. Early in the afternoon freeze the creams and
sherbets.</p>
<p>Make a list of the principal dishes. With each dish have a list of
the vegetables, sauces or other things to be served, and the time for
serving. This will insure the dishes being ready at the proper moment.
Have the plates and other dishes counted and ready to warm--and, by the
way, arrange to have these and the silver washed where the noise cannot
reach the guests.</p>
<p>Twelve seems to be a good number of people for a dinner party. But
very little increase in the quantity of material will be required if the
number should be as large as sixteen or eighteen. Fox six or eight the
quantity of soup, oysters, creams, sherbets and coffee, can be
diminished one-third, but that of meats and fish should not be much
smaller. It is supposed that the coffee will be served in small cups.
Although it is usually drunk clear, cream and sugar should be offered
with it.</p>
<p>People differ as to the kinds of breakfast required. Many believe in
the French custom of having only chocolate or coffee, rolls, and perhaps
eggs in some form. Again, others believe in and require a substantial
breakfast. There is no limit to the variety of dishes that can be
prepared for breakfast and tea if the cook has taste and judgment in
using the remains of meats, fish and vegetables left from dinner. Either
oatmeal or hominy should always be served at breakfast. When it is
possible, have fruit for the first course.</p>

This file should be named 8mpcb10h.htm or 8mpcb10h.zip
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, 8mpcb11h.htm
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, 8mpcb10ah.htm

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

In answer to various questions we have received on this:

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the
following that you do or cause:  [1] distribution of this eBook,
[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the eBook,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this eBook electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     eBook or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this eBook in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word
     processing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     *EITHER*:

     [*]  The eBook, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the eBook (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          eBook in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC
          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the eBook refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Foundation of 20% of the
     gross profits you derive calculated using the method you
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"
     the 60 days following each date you prepare (or were
     legally required to prepare) your annual (or equivalent
     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.

WHAT IF YOU *WANT* TO SEND MONEY EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO?
Project Gutenberg is dedicated to increasing the number of
public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed
in machine readable form.

The Project gratefully accepts contributions of money, time,
