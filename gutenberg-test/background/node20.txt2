Debian GNU/Linux Installation Main Menu



You may see a dialog box that says ``The installation program is determining
the current state of your system and the next installation step that should
be performed.'' This is a phase in which the installation program automatically
figures out what you probably need to do next. In some cases, you may not even
see this box.


During the entire installation process, you will be presented with the main
menu, titled ``Debian GNU/Linux Installation Main Menu.'' The choices at the
top of the menu will change to indicate your progress in installing the system.

that you could teach a chicken to install Debian! He meant that the
installation process was mostly just pecking at the Enter
key.  The first choice on the installation menu is the next action that you
should perform according to what the system detects you have already done.  It
should say ``Next,'' and at this point the next step in installing the system
will be taken.
