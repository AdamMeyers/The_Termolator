      Salem, June 15, 1835.&mdash;A walk down to the Juniper. The shore of the
      coves strewn with bunches of sea-weed, driven in by recent winds.
      Eel-grass, rolled and bundled up, and entangled with it,&mdash;large
      marine vegetables, of an olive-color, with round, slender, snake-like
      stalks, four or five feet long, and nearly two feet broad: these are the
      herbage of the deep sea. Shoals of fishes, at a little distance from the
      shore, discernible by their fins out of water. Among the heaps of sea-weed
      there were sometimes small pieces of painted wood, bark, and other
      driftage. On the shore, with pebbles of granite, there were round or oval
      pieces of brick, which the waves had rolled about till they resembled a
      natural mineral. Huge stones tossed about, in every variety of confusion,
      some shagged all over with sea-weed, others only partly covered, others
      bare. The old ten-gun battery, at the outer angle of the Juniper, very
      verdant, and besprinkled with white-weed, clover, and buttercups. The
      juniper-trees are very aged and decayed and moss-grown. The grass about
      the hospital is rank, being trodden, probably, by nobody but myself. There
      is a representation of a vessel under sail, cut with a penknife, on the
      corner of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning by the almshouse, I stopped a good while to look at the pigs,&mdash;a
      great herd,&mdash;who seemed to be just finishing their suppers. They
      certainly are types of unmitigated sensuality,&mdash;some standing in the
      trough, in the midst of their own and others' victuals,&mdash;some
      thrusting their noses deep into the food,&mdash;some rubbing their backs
      against a post,&mdash;some huddled together between sleeping and waking,
      breathing hard,&mdash;all wallowing about; a great boar swaggering round,
      and a big sow waddling along with her huge paunch. Notwithstanding the
      unspeakable defilement with which these strange sensualists spice all
      their food, they seem to have a quick and delicate sense of smell. What
      ridiculous-looking animals! Swift himself could not have imagined anything
      nastier than what they practise by the mere impulse of natural genius. Yet
      the Shakers keep their pigs very clean, and with great advantage. The
      legion of devils in the herd of swine,&mdash;what a scene it must have
      been!
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunday evening, going by the jail, the setting sun kindled up the windows
      most cheerfully; as if there were a bright, comfortable light within its
      darksome stone wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      June 18th.&mdash;A walk in North Salem in the decline of yesterday
      afternoon, &mdash;beautiful weather, bright, sunny, with a western or
      northwestern wind just cool enough, and a slight superfluity of heat. The
      verdure, both of trees and grass, is now in its prime, the leaves elastic,
      all life. The grass-fields are plenteously bestrewn with white-weed, large
      spaces looking as white as a sheet of snow, at a distance, yet with an
      indescribably warmer tinge than snow,&mdash;living white, intermixed with
      living green. The hills and hollows beyond the Cold Spring copiously
      shaded, principally with oaks of good growth, and some walnut-trees, with
      the rich sun brightening in the midst of the open spaces, and mellowing
      and fading into the shade,&mdash;and single trees, with their cool spot of
      shade, in the waste of sun: quite a picture of beauty, gently picturesque.
      The surface of the land is so varied, with woodland mingled, that the eye
      cannot reach far away, except now and then in vistas perhaps across the
      river, showing houses, or a church and surrounding village, in Upper
      Beverly. In one of the sunny bits of pasture, walled irregularly in with
      oak-shade, I saw a gray mare feeding, and, as I drew near, a colt sprang
      up from amid the grass,&mdash;a very small colt. He looked me in the face,
      and I tried to startle him, so as to make him gallop; but he stretched his
      long legs, one after another, walked quietly to his mother, and began to
      suck,&mdash;just wetting his lips, not being very hungry. Then he rubbed
      his head, alternately, with each hind leg. He was a graceful little beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bathed in the cove, overhung with maples and walnuts, the water cool and
      thrilling. At a distance it sparkled bright and blue in the breeze and
      sun. There were jelly-fish swimming about, and several left to melt away
      on the shore. On the shore, sprouting amongst the sand and gravel, I found
      samphire, growing somewhat like asparagus. It is an excellent salad at
      this season, salt, yet with an herb-like vivacity, and very tender. I
      strolled slowly through the pastures, watching my long shadow making
      grave, fantastic gestures in the sun. It is a pretty sight to see the
      sunshine brightening the entrance of a road which shortly becomes deeply
      overshadowed by trees on both sides. At the Cold Spring, three little
      girls, from six to nine, were seated on the stones in which the fountain
      is set, and paddling in the water. It was a pretty picture, and would have
      been prettier, if they had shown bare little legs, instead of pantalets.
      Very large trees overhung them, and the sun was so nearly gone down that a
      pleasant gloom made the spot sombre, in contrast with these light and
      laughing little figures. On perceiving me, they rose up, tittering among
      themselves. It seemed that, there was a sort of playful malice in those
      who first saw me; for they allowed the other to keep on paddling, without
      warning her of my approach. I passed along, and heard them come chattering
      behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      June 22d.&mdash;I rode to Boston in the afternoon with Mr. Proctor. It was
      a coolish day, with clouds and intermitting sunshine, and a pretty fresh
      breeze. We stopped about an hour at the Maverick House, in the sprouting
      branch of the city, at East Boston,&mdash;a stylish house, with doors
      painted in imitation of oak; a large bar; bells ringing; the bar-keeper
      calls out, when a bell rings, "Number&mdash;"; then a waiter replies,
      "Number&mdash; answered"; and scampers up stairs. A ticket is given by the
      hostler, on taking the horse and chaise, which is returned to the
      bar-keeper when the chaise is wanted. The landlord was fashionably
      dressed, with the whitest of linen, neatly plaited, and as courteous as a
      Lord Chamberlain. Visitors from Boston thronging the house,&mdash;some,
      standing at the bar, watching the process of preparing tumblers of punch,&mdash;others
      sitting at the windows of different parlors,&mdash;some with faces
      flushed, puffing cigars. The bill of fare for the day was stuck up beside
      the bar. Opposite this principal hotel there was another, called "The
      Mechanics," which seemed to be equally thronged. I suspect that the
      company were about on a par in each; for at the Maverick House, though
      well dressed, they seemed to be merely Sunday gentlemen,&mdash;mostly
      young fellows,&mdash;clerks in dry-goods stores being the aristocracy of
      them. One, very fashionable in appearance, with a handsome cane, happened
      to stop by me and lift up his foot, and I noticed that the sole of his
      boot (which was exquisitely polished) was all worn out. I apprehend that
      some such minor deficiencies might have been detected in the general
      showiness of most of them. There were girls, too, but not pretty ones,
      nor, on the whole, such good imitations of gentility as the young men.
      There were as many people as are usually collected at a muster, or on
      similar occasions, lounging about, without any apparent enjoyment; but the
      observation of this may serve me to make a sketch of the mode of spending
      the Sabbath by the majority of unmarried, young, middling-class people,
      near a great town. Most of the people had smart canes and bosom-pins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crossing the ferry into Boston, we went to the City Tavern, where the
      bar-room presented a Sabbath scene of repose,&mdash;stage-folk lounging in
      chairs half asleep, smoking cigars, generally with clean linen and other
      niceties of apparel, to mark the day. The doors and blinds of an oyster
      and refreshment shop across the street were closed, but I saw people enter
      it. There were two owls in a back court, visible through a window of the
      bar-room,&mdash;speckled gray, with dark-blue eyes,&mdash;the
      queerest-looking birds that exist,&mdash;so solemn and wise,&mdash;dozing
      away the day, much like the rest of the people, only that they looked
      wiser than any others. Their hooked beaks looked like hooked noses. A dull
      scene this. A stranger, here and there, poring over a newspaper. Many of
      the stage-folk sitting in chairs on the pavement, in front of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went to the top of the hill which formed part of Gardiner Greene's
      estate, and which is now in the process of levelling, and pretty much
      taken away, except the highest point, and a narrow path to ascend to it.
      It gives an admirable view of the city, being almost as high as the
      steeples and the dome of the State House, and overlooking the whole mass
      of brick buildings and slated roofs, with glimpses of streets far below.
      It was really a pity to take it down. I noticed the stump of a very large
      elm, recently felled. No house in the city could have reared its roof so
      high as the roots of that tree, if indeed the church-spires did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      On our drive home we passed through Charlestown. Stages in abundance were
      passing the road, burdened with passengers inside and out; also chaises
      and barouches, horsemen and footmen. We are a community of
      Sabbath-breakers.
    </p>
    <p>
      August 31st.&mdash;A drive to Nahant yesterday afternoon. Stopped at
      Rice's, and afterwards walked down to the steamboat wharf to see the
      passengers land. It is strange how few good faces there are in the world,
      comparatively to the ugly ones. Scarcely a single comely one in all this
      collection. Then to the hotel. Barouches at the doors, and gentlemen and
      ladies going to drive, and gentlemen smoking round the piazza. The
      bar-keeper had one of Benton's mint-drops for a bosom-brooch! It made a
      very handsome one. I crossed the beach for home about sunset. The tide was
      so far down as just to give me a passage on the hard sand, between the sea
      and the loose gravel. The sea was calm and smooth, with only the
      surf-waves whitening along the beach. Several ladies and gentlemen on
      horseback were cantering and galloping before and behind me.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hint of a story,&mdash;some incident which should bring on a general
      war; and the chief actor in the incident to have something corresponding
      to the mischief he had caused.
    </p>
    <p>
      September 7th&mdash;A drive to Ipswich with B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. At the
      tavern was an old, fat, country major, and another old fellow, laughing
      and playing off jokes on each other,&mdash;one tying a ribbon upon the
      other's hat. One had been a trumpeter to the major's troop. Walking about
      town, we knocked, for a whim, at the door of a dark old house, and
      inquired if Miss Hannah Lord lived there. A woman of about thirty came to
      the door, with rather a confused smile, and a disorder about the bosom of
      her dress, as if she had been disturbed while nursing her child. She
      answered us with great kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering the burial-ground, where some masons were building a tomb, we
      found a good many old monuments, and several covered with slabs of red
      freestone or slate, and with arms sculptured on the slab, or an inlaid
      circle of slate. On one slate gravestone, of the Rev. Nathl. Rogers, there
      was a portrait of that worthy, about a third of the size of life, carved
      in relief, with his cloak, band, and wig, in excellent preservation, all
      the buttons of his waistcoat being cut with great minuteness,&mdash;the
      minister's nose being on a level with his cheeks. It was an upright
      gravestone. Returning home, I held a colloquy with a young girl about the
      right road. She had come out to feed a pig, and was a little suspicious
      that we were making fun of her, yet answered us with a shy laugh and
      good-nature,&mdash;the pig all the time squealing for his dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Displayed along the walls, and suspended from the pillars of the original
      King's Chapel, were coats-of-arms of the king, the successive governors,
      and other distinguished men. In the pulpit there was an hour-glass on a
      large and elaborate brass stand. The organ was surmounted by a gilt crown
      in the centre, supported by a gilt mitre on each side. The governor's pew
      had Corinthian pillars, and crimson damask tapestry. In 1727 it was lined
      with china, probably tiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saint Augustin, at mass, charged all that were accursed to go out of the
      church. "Then a dead body arose, and went out of the church into the
      churchyard, with a white cloth on its head, and stood there till mass was
      over. It was a former lord of the manor, whom a curate had cursed because
      he refused to pay his tithes. A justice also commanded the dead curate to
      arise, and gave him a rod; and the dead lord, kneeling, received penance
      thereby." He then ordered the lord to go again to his grave, which he did,
      and fell immediately to ashes. Saint Augustin offered to pray for the
      curate, that he might remain on earth to confirm men in their belief; but
      the curate refused, because he was in the place of rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sketch to be given of a modern reformer,&mdash;a type of the extreme
      doctrines on the subject of slaves, cold water, and other such topics. He
      goes about the streets haranguing most eloquently, and is on the point of
      making many converts, when his labors are suddenly interrupted by the
      appearance of the keeper of a mad-house, whence he has escaped. Much may
      be made of this idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      A change from a gay young girl to an old woman; the melancholy events, the
      effects of which have clustered around her character, and gradually imbued
      it with their influence, till she becomes a lover of sick-chambers, taking
      pleasure in receiving dying breaths and in laying out the dead; also
      having her mind full of funeral reminiscences, and possessing more
      acquaintances beneath the burial turf than above it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A well-concerted train of events to be thrown into confusion by some
      misplaced circumstance, unsuspected till the catastrophe, yet exerting its
      influence from beginning to end.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the common, at dusk, after a salute from two field-pieces, the smoke
      lay long and heavily on the ground, without much spreading beyond the
      original space over which it had gushed from the guns. It was about the
      height of a man. The evening clear, but with an autumnal chill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world is so sad and solemn, that things meant in jest are liable, by
      an overpowering influence, to become dreadful earnest,&mdash;gayly dressed
      fantasies turning to ghostly and black-clad images of themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      A story, the hero of which is to be represented as naturally capable of
      deep and strong passion, and looking forward to the time when he shall
      feel passionate love, which is to be the great event of his existence. But
      it so chances that he never falls in love, and although he gives up the
      expectation of so doing, and marries calmly, yet it is somewhat sadly,
      with sentiments merely of esteem for his bride. The lady might be one who
      had loved him early in life, but whom then, in his expectation of
      passionate love, he had scorned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene of a story or sketch to be laid within the light of a
      street-lantern; the time, when the lamp is near going out; and the
      catastrophe to be simultaneous with the last flickering gleam.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peculiar weariness and depression of spirits which is felt after a day
      wasted in turning over a magazine or other light miscellany, different
      from the state of the mind after severe study; because there has been no
      excitement, no difficulties to be overcome, but the spirits have
      evaporated insensibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      To represent the process by which sober truth gradually strips off all the
      beautiful draperies with which imagination has enveloped a beloved object,
      till from an angel she turns out to be a merely ordinary woman. This to be
      done without caricature, perhaps with a quiet humor interfused, but the
      prevailing impression to be a sad one. The story might consist of the
      various alterations in the feelings of the absent lover, caused by
      successive events that display the true character of his mistress; and the
      catastrophe should take place at their meeting, when he finds himself
      equally disappointed in her person; or the whole spirit of the thing may
      here be reproduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last evening, from the opposite shore of the North River, a view of the
      town mirrored in the water, which was as smooth as glass, with no
      perceptible tide or agitation, except a trifling swell and reflux on the
      sand, although the shadow of the moon danced in it. The picture of the
      town perfect in the water,&mdash;towers of churches, houses, with here and
      there a light gleaming near the shore above, and more faintly glimmering
      under water,&mdash;all perfect, but somewhat more hazy and indistinct than
      the reality. There were many clouds flitting about the sky; and the
      picture of each could be traced in the water,&mdash;the ghost of what was
      itself unsubstantial. The rattling of wheels heard long and far through
      the town. Voices of people talking on the other side of the river, the
      tones being so distinguishable in all their variations that it seemed as
      if what was there said might be understood; but it was not so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two persons might be bitter enemies through life, and mutually cause the
      ruin of one another, and of all that were dear to them. Finally, meeting
      at the funeral of a grandchild, the offspring of a son and daughter
      married without their consent,&mdash;and who, as well as the child, had
      been the victims of their hatred,&mdash;they might discover that the
      supposed ground of the quarrel was altogether a mistake, and then be
      wofully reconciled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two persons, by mutual agreement, to make their wills in each other's
      favor, then to wait impatiently for one another's death, and both to be
      informed of the desired event at the same time. Both, in most joyous
      sorrow, hasten to be present at the funeral, meet, and find themselves
      both hoaxed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story of a man, cold and hard-hearted, and acknowledging no
      brotherhood with mankind. At his death they might try to dig him a grave,
      but, at a little space beneath the ground, strike upon a rock, as if the
      earth refused to receive the unnatural son into her bosom. Then they would
      put him into an old sepulchre, where the coffins and corpses were all
      turned to dust, and so he would be alone. Then the body would petrify; and
      he having died in some characteristic act and expression, he would seem,
      through endless ages of death, to repel society as in life, and no one
      would be buried in that tomb forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cannon transformed to church-bells.
    </p>
    <p>
      A person, even before middle age, may become musty and faded among the
      people with whom he has grown up from childhood; but, by migrating to a
      new place, he appears fresh with the effect of youth, which may be
      communicated from the impressions of others to his own feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an old house, a mysterious knocking might be beard on the wall, where
      had formerly been a doorway, now bricked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might be stated, as the closing circumstance of a tale, that the body
      of one of the characters had been petrified, and still existed in that
      state.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young man to win the love of a girl, without any serious intentions, and
      to find that in that love, which might have been the greatest blessing of
      his life, he had conjured up a spirit of mischief which pursued him
      throughout his whole career,&mdash;and this without any revengeful
      purposes on the part of the deserted girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two lovers, or other persons, on the most private business, to appoint a
      meeting in what they supposed to be a place of the utmost solitude, and to
      find it thronged with people.
    </p>
    <p>
      October 17th.&mdash;Some of the oaks are now a deep brown red; others are
      changed to a light green, which, at a little distance, especially in the
      sunshine, looks like the green of early spring. In some trees, different
      masses of the foliage show each of these hues. Some of the walnut-trees
      have a yet more delicate green. Others are of a bright sunny yellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; was married to Miss &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; last
      Wednesday. Yesterday Mr. Brazer, preaching on the comet, observed that not
      one, probably, of all who heard him, would witness its reappearance. Mrs.
      &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; shed tears. Poor soul! she would be contented to
      dwell in earthly love to all eternity!

      Prideaux, Bishop of Worcester, during the sway of the Parliament, was
      forced to support himself and his family by selling his household goods. A
      friend asked him, "How doth your lordship?" "Never better in my life,"
      said the Bishop, "only I have too great a stomach; for I have eaten that
      little plate which the sequestrators left me. I have eaten a great library
      of excellent books. I have eaten a great deal of linen, much of my brass,
      some of my pewter, and now I am come to eat iron; and what will come next
      I know not."

      Sentiments in a foreign language, which merely convey the sentiment
      without retaining to the reader any graces of style or harmony of sound,
      have somewhat of the charm of thoughts in one's own mind that have not yet
      been put into words. No possible words that we might adapt to them could
      realize the unshaped beauty that they appear to possess. This is the
      reason that translations are never satisfactory,&mdash;and less so, I
      should think, to one who cannot than to one who can pronounce the
      language.

      Salem, August 31st, 1836.&mdash;A walk, yesterday, down to the shore, near
      the hospital. Standing on the old grassy battery, that forms a semicircle,
      and looking seaward. The sun not a great way above the horizon, yet so far
      as to give a very golden brightness, when it shone out. Clouds in the
      vicinity of the sun, and nearly all the rest of the sky covered with
      clouds in masses, not a gray uniformity of cloud. A fresh breeze blowing
      from land seaward. If it had been blowing from the sea, it would have
      raised it in heavy billows, and caused it to dash high against the rocks.
      But now its surface was not at all commoved with billows; there was only
      roughness enough to take off the gleam, and give it the aspect of iron
      after cooling. The clouds above added to the black appearance. A few
      sea-birds were flitting over the water, only visible at moments, when they
      turned their white bosoms towards me,&mdash;as if they were then first
      created. The sunshine had a singular effect. The clouds would interpose in
      such a manner that some objects were shaded from it, while others were
      strongly illuminated. Some of the islands lay in the shade, dark and
      gloomy, while others were bright and favored spots. The white lighthouse
      was sometimes very cheerfully marked. There was a schooner about a mile
      from the shore, at anchor, laden apparently with lumber. The sea all about
      her had the black, iron aspect which I have described; but the vessel
      herself was alight. Hull, masts, and spars were all gilded, and the
      rigging was made of golden threads. A small white streak of foam breaking
      around the bows, which were towards the wind. The shadowiness of the
      clouds overhead made the effect of the sunlight strange, where it fell.

      Mr. Kirby, author of a work on the History, Habits, and Instincts of
      Animals, questions whether there may not be an abyss of waters within the
      globe, communicating with the ocean, and whether the huge animals of the
      Saurian tribe&mdash;great reptiles, supposed to be exclusively
      antediluvian, and now extinct&mdash;may not be inhabitants of it. He
      quotes a passage from Revelation, where the creatures under the earth are
      spoken of as distinct from those of the sea, and speaks of a Saurian
      fossil that has been found deep in the subterranean regions. He thinks, or
      suggests, that these may be the dragons of Scripture.

      It is said of the eagle, that, in however long a flight, he is never seen

      the action of the wind on her sails.

      In old country-houses in England, instead of glass for windows, they used
      wicker, or fine strips of oak disposed checkerwise. Horn was also used.
      The windows of princes and great noblemen were of crystal; those of
      Studley Castle, Holinshed says, of beryl. There were seldom chimneys; and
      they cooked their meats by a fire made against an iron back in the great
      hall. Houses, often of gentry, were built of a heavy timber frame, filled
      up with lath and plaster. People slept on rough mats or straw pallets,
      with a round log for a pillow; seldom better beds than a mattress, with a
      sack of chaff for a pillow.

      October 25th.&mdash;A walk yesterday through Dark Lane, and home through
      the village of Danvers. Landscape now wholly autumnal. Saw an elderly man
      laden with two dry, yellow, rustling bundles of Indian corn-stalks,&mdash;a
      good personification of Autumn. Another man hoeing up potatoes. Rows of
      white cabbages lay ripening. Fields of dry Indian corn. The grass has
      still considerable greenness. Wild rose-bushes devoid of leaves, with
      their deep, bright red seed-vessels. Meeting-house in Danvers seen at a
      distance, with the sun shining through the windows of its belfry.
      Barberry-bushes,&mdash;the leaves now of a brown red, still juicy and
      healthy; very few berries remaining, mostly frost-bitten and wilted. All
      among the yet green grass, dry stalks of weeds. The down of thistles
      occasionally seen flying through the sunny air.

      A Thanksgiving dinner. All the miserable on earth are to be invited,
      &mdash;as the drunkard, the bereaved parent, the ruined merchant, the
      broken-hearted lover, the poor widow, the old man and woman who have
      outlived their generation, the disappointed author, the wounded, sick, and
      broken soldier, the diseased person, the infidel, the man with an evil
      conscience, little orphan children or children of neglectful parents,
      shall be admitted to the table, and many others. The giver of the feast
      goes out to deliver his invitations. Some of the guests he meets in the
      streets, some he knocks for at the doors of their houses. The description
      must be rapid. But who must be the giver of the feast, and what his claims
      to preside? A man who has never found out what he is fit for, who has
      unsettled aims or objects in life, and whose mind gnaws him, making him
      the sufferer of many kinds of misery. He should meet some pious, old,
      sorrowful person, with more outward calamities than any other, and invite
      him, with a reflection that piety would make all that miserable company
      truly thankful.

      A new classification of society to be instituted. Instead of rich and
      poor, high and low, they are to be classed,&mdash;First, by their sorrows:
      for instance, whenever there are any, whether in fair mansion or hovel,
      who are mourning the loss of relations and friends, and who wear black,
      whether the cloth be coarse or superfine, they are to make one class.
      Secondly, all who have the same maladies, whether they lie under damask
      canopies or on straw pallets or in the wards of hospitals, they are to
      form one class. Thirdly, all who are guilty of the same sins, whether the
      world knows them or not; whether they languish in prison, looking forward
      to the gallows, or walk honored among men, they also form a class. Then
      proceed to generalize and classify the whole world together, as none can
      claim utter exemption from either sorrow, sin, or disease; and if they
      could, yet Death, like a great parent, comes and sweeps them all through
      one darksome portal,&mdash;all his children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortune to come like a pedler with his goods,&mdash;as wreaths of laurel,
      diamonds, crowns; selling them, but asking for them the sacrifice of

      pleasures of existence. Who would buy, if the price were to be paid down?

      Two lovers to plan the building of a pleasure-house on a certain spot of
      ground, but various seeming accidents prevent it. Once they find a group
      of miserable children there; once it is the scene where crime is plotted;
      at last the dead body of one of the lovers or of a dear friend is found
      there; and, instead of a pleasure-house, they build a marble tomb. The
      moral,&mdash;that there is no place on earth fit for the site of a
      pleasure-house, because there is no spot that may not have been saddened
      by human grief, stained by crime, or hallowed by death. It might be three
      friends who plan it, instead of two lovers; and the dearest one dies.

      A girl's lover to be slain and buried in her flower-garden, and the earth

      some peculiar variety of flowers, produces them of admirable splendor,
      beauty, and perfume; and she delights, with an indescribable impulse, to
      wear them in her bosom, and scent her chamber with them. Thus the classic

      Pepin, from the Emperor Constantine, in 757. Water boiling was kept in a
      reservoir under the pipes; and, the keys being struck, the valves opened,
      and steam rushed through with noise. The secret of working them thus is
      now lost. Then came bellows organs, first used by Louis le Debonnaire.

      In 1621, a Mr. Copinger left a certain charity, an almshouse, of which
      four poor persons were to partake, after the death of his eldest son and
      his wife. It was a tenement and yard. The parson, head-boroughs, and his
      five other sons were to appoint the persons. At the time specified,
      however, all but one of his sons were dead; and he was in such poor
      circumstances that he obtained the benefit of the charity for himself, as
      one of the four.

      Tarleton, of the Revolution, is said to have been one of the two
      handsomest men in Europe,&mdash;the Prince of Wales, afterwards George
      IV., being the other. Some authorities, however, have represented him as
      ungainly in person and rough in manners. Tarleton was originally bred to
      the law, but quitted law for the army early in life. He was son to a mayor
      of Liverpool, born in 1754, of ancient family. He wrote his own memoirs
      after returning from America. Afterwards in Parliament. Never afterwards
      distinguished in arms. Created baronet in 1818, and died childless in
      1833. Thought he was not sufficiently honored among more modern heroes.

      Maine, July 5th, 1837.&mdash;Here I am, settled since night before last
      with B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, and living very singularly. He leads a
      bachelor's life in his paternal mansion, only a small part of which is
      occupied by a family who serve him. He provides his own breakfast and
      supper, and occasionally his dinner; though this is oftener, I believe,
      taken at the hotel, or an eating-house, or with some of his relatives. I
      am his guest, and my presence makes no alteration in his way of life. Our
      fare, thus far, has consisted of bread, butter, and cheese, crackers,
      herrings, boiled eggs, coffee, milk, and claret wine. He has another
      inmate, in the person of a queer little Frenchman, who has his breakfast,
      tea, and lodging here, and finds his dinner elsewhere. Monsieur S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      does not appear to be more than twenty-one years old,&mdash;a diminutive
      figure, with eyes askew, and otherwise of an ungainly physiognomy; he is
      ill-dressed also, in a coarse blue coat, thin cotton pantaloons, and
      unbrushed boots; altogether with as little of French coxcombry as can well
      be imagined, though with something of the monkey aspect inseparable from a
      little Frenchman. He is, nevertheless, an intelligent and well-informed
      man, apparently of extensive reading in his own language,&mdash;a
      philosopher, B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; tells me, and an infidel. His
      insignificant personal appearance stands in the way of his success, and
      prevents him from receiving the respect which is really due to his talents
      and acquirements; wherefore he is bitterly dissatisfied with the country
      and its inhabitants, and often expresses his feelings to B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      (who has gained his confidence to a certain degree) in very strong terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus here are three characters, each with something out of the common way,
      living together somewhat like monks. B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, our host,
      combines more high and admirable qualities, of that sort which make up a
      gentleman, than any other that I have met with. Polished, yet natural,
      frank, open, and straightforward, yet with a delicate feeling for the
      sensitiveness of his companions; of excellent temper and warm heart; well
      acquainted with the world, with a keen faculty of observation, which he
      has had many opportunities of exercising, and never varying from a code of
      honor and principle which is really nice and rigid in its way. There is a
      sort of philosophy developing itself in him which will not impossibly
      cause him to settle down in this or some other equally singular course of
      life. He seems almost to have made up his mind never to be married, which
      I wonder at; for he has strong affections, and is fond both of women and
      children.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little Frenchman impresses me very strongly, too,&mdash;so lonely as
      he is here, struggling against the world, with bitter feelings in his
      breast, and yet talking with the vivacity and gayety of his nation; making
      this his home from darkness to daylight, and enjoying here what little
      domestic comfort and confidence there is for him; and then going about all
      the livelong day, teaching French to blockheads who sneer at him, and
      returning at about ten o'clock in the evening (for I was wrong in saying
      he supped here,&mdash;he eats no supper) to his solitary room and bed.
      Before retiring, he goes to B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s bedside, and, if he
      finds him awake, stands talking French, expressing his dislike of the
      Americans, "Je hais, je hais les Yankees!"&mdash;thus giving vent to the
      stifled bitterness of the whole day. In the morning I hear him getting up
      early, at sunrise or before, humming to himself, scuffling about his
      chamber with his thick boots, and at last taking his departure for a
      solitary ramble till breakfast. Then he comes in, cheerful and vivacious
      enough, eats pretty heartily, and is off again, singing French chansons as
      he goes down the gravel-walk. The poor fellow has nobody to sympathize
      with him but B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, and thus a singular connection is
      established between two utterly different characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then here is myself, who am likewise a queer character in my way, and have
      come to spend a week or two with my friend of half a lifetime,&mdash;the
      longest space, probably, that we are ever destined to spend together; for
      Fate seems preparing changes for both of us. My circumstances, at least,
      cannot long continue as they are and have been; and B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      too, stands between high prosperity and utter ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I should soon become strongly attached to our way of life, so
      independent and untroubled by the forms and restrictions of society. The
      house is very pleasantly situated,&mdash;half a mile distant from where
      the town begins to be thickly settled, and on a swell of land, with the
      road running at a distance of fifty yards, and a grassy tract and a
      gravel-walk between. Beyond the road rolls the Kennebec, here two or three
      hundred yards wide. Putting my head out of the window, I can see it
      flowing steadily along straightway between wooded banks; but arriving
      nearly opposite the house, there is a large and level sand island in the
      middle of the stream; and just below the island the current is further
      interrupted by the works of the mill-dam, which is perhaps half finished,
      yet still in so rude a state that it looks as much like the ruins of a dam
      destroyed by the spring freshets as like the foundations of a dam yet to
      be. Irishmen and Canadians toil at work on it, and the echoes of their
      hammering and of the voices come across the river and up to this window.
      Then there is a sound of the wind among the trees round the house; and,
      when that is silent, the calm, full, distant voice of the river becomes
      audible. Looking downward thither, I see the rush of the current, and mark
      the different eddies, with here and there white specks or streaks of foam;
      and often a log comes floating on, glistening in the sun, as it rolls over
      among the eddies, having voyaged, for aught I know, hundreds of miles from
      the wild upper sources of the river, passing down, down, between lines of
      forest, and sometimes a rough clearing, till here it floats by cultivated
      banks, and will soon pass by the village. Sometimes a long raft of boards
      comes along, requiring the nicest skill in navigating it through the
      narrow passage left by the mill-dam. Chaises and wagons occasionally go
      over the road, the riders all giving a passing glance at the dam, or
      perhaps alighting to examine it more fully, and at last departing with
      ominous shakes of the head as to the result of the enterprise. My position
      is so far retired from the river and mill-dam, that, though the latter is
      really rather a scene, yet a sort of quiet seems to be diffused over the
      whole. Two or three times a day this quiet is broken by the sudden thunder
      from a quarry, where the workmen are blasting rocks; and a peal of thunder
      sounds strangely in such a green, sunny, and quiet landscape, with the
      blue sky brightening the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have not seen much of the people. There have been, however, several
      incidents which amused me, though scarcely worth telling. A passionate
      tavern-keeper, quick as a flash of gunpowder, a nervous man, and showing
      in his demeanor, it seems, a consciousness of his infirmity of temper. I
      was a witness of a scuffle of his with a drunken guest. The tavern-keeper,
      after they were separated, raved like a madman, and in a tone of voice
      having a drolly pathetic or lamentable sound mingled with its rage, as if
      he were lifting up his voice to weep. Then he jumped into a chaise which
      was standing by, whipped up the horse, and drove off rapidly, as if to
      give his fury vent in that way.

      On the morning of the Fourth of July, two printer's apprentice-lads,
      nearly grown, dressed in jackets and very tight pantaloons of check, tight
      as their skins, so that they looked like harlequins or circus-clowns, yet
      appeared to think themselves in perfect propriety, with a very calm and
      quiet assurance of the admiration of the town. A common fellow, a
      carpenter, who, on the strength of political partisanship, asked B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s
      assistance in cutting out great letters from play-bills in order to print
      "Martin Van Buren Forever" on a flag; but B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; refused.
      B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; seems to be considerably of a favorite with the
      lower orders, especially with the Irishmen and French Canadians,&mdash;the
      latter accosting him in the street, and asking his assistance as an
      interpreter in making their bargains for work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I meant to dine at the hotel with B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; to-day; but
      having returned to the house, leaving him to do some business in the
      village, I found myself unwilling to move when the dinner-hour approached,
      and therefore dined very well on bread, cheese, and eggs. Nothing of much
      interest takes place. We live very comfortably in our bachelor
      establishment on a cold shoulder of mutton, with ham and smoked beef and
      boiled eggs; and as to drinkables, we had both claret and brown sherry on
      the dinner-table to-day. Last evening we had along literary and
      philosophical conversation with Monsieur S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. He is
      rather remarkably well-informed for a man of his age, and seems to have
      very just notions on ethics, etc., though damnably perverted as to
      religion. It is strange to hear philosophy of any sort from such a boyish
      figure. "We philosophers," he is fond of saying, to distinguish himself
      and his brethren from the Christians. One of his oddities is, that, while
      steadfastly maintaining an opinion that he is a very small and slow eater,
      and that we, in common with other Yankees, eat immensely and fast, he
      actually eats both faster and longer than we do, and devours, as B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;avers,
      more victuals than both of us together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saturday, July 8th.&mdash;Yesterday afternoon, a stroll with B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      up a large brook, he fishing for trout, and I looking on. The brook runs
      through a valley, on one side bordered by a high and precipitous bank; on
      the other there is an interval, and then the bank rises upward and upward
      into a high hill with gorges and ravines separating one summit from
      another, and here and there are bare places, where the rain-streams have
      washed away the grass. The brook is bestrewn with stones, some bare, some
      partially moss-grown, and sometimes so huge as&mdash;once at least&mdash;to
      occupy almost the whole breadth of the current. Amongst these the stream
      brawls, only that this word does not express its good-natured voice, and
      "murmur" is too quiet. It sings along, sometimes smooth, with the pebbles
      visible beneath, sometimes rushing dark and swift, eddying and whitening
      past some rock, or underneath the hither or the farther bank; and at these
      places B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; cast his line, and sometimes drew out a
      trout, small, not more than five or six inches long. The farther we went
      up the brook, the wilder it grew. The opposite bank was covered with pines
      and hemlocks, ascending high upwards, black and solemn. One knew that
      there must be almost a precipice behind, yet we could not see it. At the
      foot you could spy, a little way within the darksome shade, the roots and
      branches of the trees; but soon all sight was obstructed amidst the
      trunks. On the hither side, at first the bank was bare, then fringed with
      alder-bushes, bending and dipping into the stream, which, farther on,
      flowed through the midst of a forest of maple, beech, and other trees, its
      course growing wilder and wilder as we proceeded. For a considerable
      distance there was a causeway, built long ago of logs, to drag lumber
      upon; it was now decayed and rotten, a red decay, sometimes sunken down in
      the midst, here and there a knotty trunk stretching across, apparently
      sound. The sun being now low towards the west, a pleasant gloom and
      brightness were diffused through the forest, spots of brightness scattered
      upon the branches, or thrown down in gold upon the last year's leaves
      among the trees. At last we came to where a dam had been built across the
      brook many years ago, and was now gone to ruin, so as to make the spot
      look more solitary and wilder than if man had never left vestiges of his
      toil there. It was a framework of logs with a covering of plank sufficient
      to obstruct the onward flow of the brook; but it found its way past the
      side, and came foaming and struggling along among scattered rocks. Above
      the dam there was a broad and deep pool, one side of which was bordered by
      a precipitous wall of rocks, as smooth as if hewn out and squared, and
      piled one upon another, above which rose the forest. On the other side
      there was still a gently shelving bank, and the shore was covered with
      tall trees, among which I particularly remarked a stately pine, wholly
      devoid of bark, rising white in aged and majestic ruin, thrusting out its
      barkless arms. It must have stood there in death many years, its own
      ghost. Above the dam the brook flowed through the forest, a glistening and
      babbling water-path, illuminated by the sun, which sent its rays almost
      straight along its course. It was as lovely and wild and peaceful as it
      could possibly have been a hundred years ago; and the traces of labors of
      men long departed added a deeper peace to it. I bathed in the pool, and
      then pursued my way down beside the brook, growing dark with a pleasant
      gloom, as the sun sank and the water became more shadowy. B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      says that there was formerly a tradition that the Indians used to go up
      this brook, and return, after a brief absence, with large masses of lead,
      which they sold at the trading-stations in Augusta; whence there has
      always been an idea that there is a lead-mine hereabouts. Great toadstools
      were under the trees, and some small ones as yellow and almost the size of
      a half-broiled yolk of an egg. Strawberries were scattered along the
      brookside.

      July 9th.&mdash;Went with B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; to pay a visit to the
      shanties of the Irish and Canadians. He says that they sell and exchange
      these small houses among themselves continually. They may be built in
      three or four days, and are valued at four or five dollars. When the turf
      that is piled against the walls of some of them becomes covered with
      grass, it makes quite a picturesque object. It was almost dusk&mdash;just
      candle-lighting time&mdash;when we visited them. A young Frenchwoman, with
      a baby in her arms, came to the door of one of them, smiling, and looking
      pretty and happy. Her husband, a dark, black-haired, lively little fellow,
      caressed the child, laughing and singing to it; and there was a
      red-bearded Irishman, who likewise fondled the little brat. Then we could
      hear them within the hut, gabbling merrily, and could see them moving
      about briskly in the candlelight, through the window and open door. An old
      Irishwoman sat in the door of another hut, under the influence of an extra
      dose of rum,&mdash;she being an old lady of somewhat dissipated habits.
      She called to B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, and began to talk to him about her
      resolution not to give up her house: for it is his design to get her out
      of it. She is a true virago, and, though somewhat restrained by respect
      for him, she evinced a sturdy design to remain here through the winter, or
      at least for a considerable time longer. He persisting, she took her stand
      in the doorway of the hut, and stretched out her fist in a very Amazonian
      attitude. "Nobody," quoth she, "shall drive me out of this house, till my
      praties are out of the ground." Then would she wheedle and laugh and
      blarney, beginning in a rage, and ending as if she had been in jest.
      Meanwhile her husband stood by very quiet, occasionally trying to still
      her; but it is to be presumed, that, after our departure, they came to
      blows, it being a custom with the Irish husbands and wives to settle their
      disputes with blows; and it is said the woman often proves the better man.
      The different families also have battles, and occasionally the Irish fight
      with the Canadians. The latter, however, are much the more peaceable,
      never quarrelling among themselves, and seldom with their neighbors. They
      are frugal, and often go back to Canada with considerable sums of money. B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      has gained much influence both with the Irish and the French,&mdash;with
      the latter, by dint of speaking to them in their own language. He is the
      umpire in their disputes, and their adviser, and they look up to him as a
      protector and patron-friend. I have been struck to see with what careful
      integrity and wisdom he manages matters among them, hitherto having known
      him only as a free and gay young man. He appears perfectly to understand
      their general character, of which he gives no very flattering description.
      In these huts, less than twenty feet square, he tells me that upwards of
      twenty people have sometimes been lodged.

      A description of a young lady who had formerly been insane, and now felt
      the approach of a new fit of madness. She had been out to ride, had
      exerted herself much, and had been very vivacious. On her return, she sat
      down in a thoughtful and despondent attitude, looking very sad, but one of
      the loveliest objects that ever were seen. The family spoke to her, but
      she made no answer, nor took the least notice; but still sat like a statue
      in her chair,&mdash;a statue of melancholy and beauty. At last they led
      her away to her chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went to meeting this forenoon. I saw nothing remarkable, unless a
      little girl in the next pew to us, three or four years old, who fell
      asleep, with her bead in the lap of her maid, and looked very pretty: a
      picture of sleeping innocence.

      July 11th, Tuesday.&mdash;A drive with B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; to
      Hallowell, yesterday, where we dined, and afterwards to Gardiner. The most
      curious object in this latter place was the elegant new mansion of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
      It stands on the site of his former dwelling, which was destroyed by fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new building was estimated to cost about thirty thousand dollars; but
      twice as much has already been expended, and a great deal more will be
      required to complete it. It is certainly a splendid structure; the
      material, granite from the vicinity. At the angles it has small, circular
      towers; the portal is lofty and imposing. Relatively to the general style
      of domestic architecture in our country, it well deserves the name of
      castle or palace. Its situation, too, is fine, far retired from the public
      road, and attainable by a winding carriage-drive; standing amid fertile
      fields, and with large trees in the vicinity. There is also a beautiful
      view from the mansion, adown the Kennebec.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beneath some of the large trees we saw the remains of circular seats,
      whereupon the family used to sit before the former house was burned down.
      There was no one now in the vicinity of the place, save a man and a yoke
      of oxen; and what he was about, I did not ascertain. Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      at present resides in a small dwelling, little more than a cottage, beside
      the main road, not far from the gateway which gives access to his palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Gardiner, on the wharf, I witnessed the starting of the steamboat New
      England for Boston. There was quite a collection of people, looking on or
      taking leave of passengers,&mdash;the steam puffing,&mdash;stages
      arriving, full-freighted with ladies and gentlemen. A man was one moment
      too late; but running along the gunwale of a mud-scow, and jumping into a
      skiff, he was put on board by a black fellow. The dark cabin, wherein,
      descending from the sunshiny deck, it was difficult to discern the
      furniture, looking-glasses, and mahogany wainscoting. I met two old
      college acquaintances, O&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, who was going to Boston,
      and B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; with whom we afterwards drank a glass of wine
      at the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, Mons. S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, and myself continue
      to live in the same style as heretofore. We appear mutually to be very
      well pleased with each other. Mons. S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; displays many
      comical qualities, and manages to insure us several hearty laughs every
      morning and evening,&mdash;those being the seasons when we meet. I am
      going to take lessons from him in the pronunciation of French. Of female
      society I see nothing. The only petticoat that comes within our premises
      appertains to Nancy, the pretty, dark-eyed maid-servant of the man who
      lives in the other part of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the road from Hallowell to Augusta we saw little booths, in two places,
      erected on the roadside, where boys offered beer, apples, etc., for sale.
      We passed an Irishwoman with a child in her arms, and a heavy bundle, and
      afterwards an Irishman with a light bundle, sitting by the highway. They
      were husband and wife; and B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; says that an Irishman
      and his wife, on their journeys, do not usually walk side by side, but
      that the man gives the woman the heaviest burden to carry, and walks on
      lightly ahead!
    </p>
    <p>
      A thought comes into my mind: Which sort of house excites the most
      contemptuous feelings in the beholder,&mdash;such a house as Mr.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s,
      all circumstances considered, or the board-built and turf-buttressed
      hovels of these wild Irish, scattered about as if they had sprung up like
      mushrooms, in the dells and gorges, and along the banks of the river?
      Mushrooms, by the way, spring up where the roots of an old tree are hidden
      under the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thursday, July 13th.&mdash;Two small Canadian boys came to our house
      yesterday, with strawberries to sell. It sounds strangely to hear children
      bargaining in French on the borders of Yankee-land. Among other languages
      spoken hereabouts must be reckoned the wild Irish. Some of the laborers on
      the mill-dam can speak nothing else. The intermixture of foreigners
      sometimes gives rise to quarrels between them and the natives. As we were
      going to the village yesterday afternoon, we witnessed the beginning of a
      quarrel between a Canadian and a Yankee,&mdash;the latter accusing the
      former of striking his oxen. B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; thrust himself between
      and parted them; but they afterwards renewed their fray, and the Canadian,
      I believe, thrashed the Yankee soundly,&mdash;for which he had to pay
      twelve dollars. Yet he was but a little fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming to the Mansion House about supper-time, we found somewhat of a
      concourse of people, the Governor and Council being in session on the
      subject of the disputed territory. The British have lately imprisoned a
      man who was sent to take the census; and the Mainiacs are much excited on
      the subject. They wish the Governor to order out the militia at once, and
      take possession of the territory with the strong hand. There was a British
      army-captain at the Mansion House; and an idea was thrown out that it
      would be as well to seize upon him as a hostage. I would, for the joke's
      sake, that it had been done. Personages at the tavern: the Governor,
      somewhat stared after as he walked through the bar-room; Councillors
      seated about, sitting on benches near the bar, or on the stoop along the
      front of the house; the Adjutant-General of the State; two young
      Blue-Noses, from Canada or the Provinces; a gentleman "thumbing his hat"
      for liquor, or perhaps playing off the trick of the "honest landlord" on
      some stranger. The decanters and wine-bottles on the move, and the beer
      and soda founts pouring out continual streams, with a whiz. Stage-drivers,
      etc., asked to drink with the aristocracy, and mine host treating and
      being treated. Rubicund faces; breaths odorous of brandy-and-water.
      Occasionally the pop of a champagne cork.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returned home, and took a lesson in French of Mons. S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
      I like him very much, and have seldom met with a more honest, simple, and
      apparently so well-principled a man; which good qualities I impute to his
      being, by the father's side, of German blood. He looks more like a German&mdash;or,
      as he says, like a Swiss&mdash;than a Frenchman, having very light hair
      and a light complexion, and not a French expression. He is a vivacious
      little fellow, and wonderfully excitable to mirth; and it is truly a sight
      to see him laugh;&mdash;every feature partakes of his movement, and even
      his whole body shares in it, as he rises and dances about the room. He has
      great variety of conversation, commensurate with his experiences in life,
      and sometimes will talk Spanish, ore rotundo,&mdash;sometimes imitate the
      Catholic priests, chanting Latin songs for the dead, in deep, gruff, awful
      tones, producing really a very strong impression,&mdash;then he will break
      out into a light, French song, perhaps of love, perhaps of war, acting it
      out, as if on the stage of a theatre: all this intermingled with continual
      fun, excited by the incidents of the passing moment. He has Frenchified
      all our names, calling B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Monsieur Du Pont, myself M.
      de L'Aubepine, and himself M. le Berger, and all, Knights of the
      Round-Table. And we live in great harmony and brotherhood, as queer a life
      as anybody leads, and as queer a set as may be found anywhere. In his more
      serious intervals, he talks philosophy and deism, and preaches obedience
      to the law of reason and morality; which law he says (and I believe him)
      he has so well observed, that, notwithstanding his residence in dissolute
      countries, he has never yet been sinful. He wishes me, eight or nine weeks
      hence, to accompany him on foot to Quebec, and then to Niagara and New
      York. I should like it well, if my circumstances and other considerations
      would permit. What pleases much in Mons. S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; is the
      simple and childlike enjoyment he finds in trifles, and the joy with which
      he speaks of going back to his own country, away from the dull Yankees,
      who here misunderstand and despise him. Yet I have never heard him speak
      harshly of them. I rather think that B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; and I will be
      remembered by him with more pleasure than anybody else in the country; for
      we have sympathized with him, and treated him kindly, and like a gentleman
      and an equal; and he comes to us at night as to home and friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went down to the river to-day to see B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; fish for
      salmon with a fly,&mdash;a hopeless business; for he says that only one
      instance has been known in the United States of salmon being taken
      otherwise than with a net. A few chubs were all the fruit of his piscatory
      efforts. But while looking at the rushing and rippling stream, I saw a
      great fish, some six feet long and thick in proportion, suddenly emerge at
      whole length, turn a somerset, and then vanish again beneath the water. It
      was of a glistening, yellowish brown, with its fins all spread, and
      looking very strange and startling, darting out so lifelike from the black
      water, throwing itself fully into the bright sunshine, and then lost to
      sight and to pursuit. I saw also a long, flat-bottomed boat go up the
      river, with a brisk wind, and against a strong stream. Its sails were of
      curious construction: a long mast, with two sails below, one on each side
      of the boat, and a broader one surmounting them. The sails were colored
      brown, and appeared like leather or skins, but were really cloth. At a
      distance, the vessel looked like, or at least I compared it to, a
      monstrous water-insect skimming along the river. If the sails had been
      crimson or yellow, the resemblance would have been much closer. There was
      a pretty spacious raised cabin in the after part of the boat. It moved
      along lightly, and disappeared between the woody banks. These boats have
      the two parallel sails attached to the same yard, and some have two sails,
      one surmounting the other. They trade to Waterville and thereabouts,&mdash;names,
      as "Paul Pry," on their sails.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saturday, July 15th.&mdash;Went with B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; yesterday to
      visit several Irish shanties, endeavoring to find out who had stolen some
      rails of a fence. At the first door at which we knocked (a shanty with an
      earthen mound heaped against the wall, two or three feet thick), the
      inmates were not up, though it was past eight o'clock. At last a
      middle-aged woman showed herself, half dressed, and completing her toilet.
      Threats were made of tearing down her house; for she is a lady of very
      indifferent morals, and sells rum. Few of these people are connected with
      the mill-dam,&mdash;or, at least, many are not so, but have intruded
      themselves into the vacant huts which were occupied by the mill-dam people
      last year. In two or three places hereabouts there is quite a village of
      these dwellings, with a clay and board chimney, or oftener an old barrel,
      smoked and charred with the fire. Some of their roofs are covered with
      sods, and appear almost subterranean. One of the little hamlets stands on
      both sides of a deep dell, wooded and bush-grown, with a vista, as it
      were, into the heart of a wood in one direction, and to the broad, sunny
      river in the other: there was a little rivulet, crossed by a plank, at the
      bottom of the dell. At two doors we saw very pretty and modest-looking
      young women,&mdash; one with a child in her arms. Indeed, they all have
      innumerable little children; and they are invariably in good health,
      though always dirty of face. They come to the door while their mothers are
      talking with the visitors, standing straight up on their bare legs, with
      their little plump bodies protruding, in one hand a small tin saucepan,
      and in the other an iron spoon, with unwashed mouths, looking as
      independent as any child or grown person in the land. They stare
      unabashed, but make no answer when spoken to. "I've no call to your fence,
      Misser B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;." It seems strange that a man should have
      the right, unarmed with any legal instrument, of tearing down the
      dwelling-houses of a score of families, and driving the inmates forth
      without a shelter. Yet B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; undoubtedly has this right;
      and it is not a little striking to see how quietly these people
      contemplate the probability of his exercising it,&mdash;resolving, indeed,
      to burrow in their holes as long as may be, yet caring about as little for
      an ejectment as those who could find a tenement anywhere, and less. Yet
      the women, amid all the trials of their situation, appear to have kept up
      the distinction between virtue and vice; those who can claim the former
      will not associate with the latter. When the women travel with young
      children, they carry the baby slung at their backs, and sleeping quietly.
      The dresses of the new-comers are old-fashioned, making them look aged
      before their time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; shaving himself yesterday morning. He was
      in excellent spirits, and could not keep his tongue or body still, more
      than long enough to make two or three consecutive strokes at his beard.
      Then he would turn, flourishing his razor and grimacing joyously, enacting
      droll antics, breaking out into scraps and verses of drinking-songs, "A
      boire! a boire!"&mdash;then laughing heartily, and crying, "Vive la
      gaite!" then resuming his task, looking into the glass with grave face, on
      which, however, a grin would soon break out anew, and all his pranks would
      be repeated with variations. He turned this foolery to philosophy, by
      observing that mirth contributed to goodness of heart, and to make us love
      our fellow-creatures. Conversing with him in the evening, he affirmed,
      with evident belief in the truth of what he said, that he would have no
      objection, except that it would be a very foolish thing, to expose his
      whole heart, his whole inner man, to the view of the world. Not that there
      would not be much evil discovered there; but, as he was conscious of being
      in a state of mental and moral improvement, working out his progress
      onward, he would not shrink from such a scrutiny. This talk was introduced
      by his mentioning the "Minister's Black Veil," which he said he had seen
      translated into French, as an exercise, by a Miss Appleton of Bangor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saw by the river-side, late in the afternoon, one of the above-described
      boats going into the stream with the water rippling at the prow, from the
      strength of the current and of the boat's motion. By and by comes down a
      raft, perhaps twenty yards long, guided by two men, one at each end,&mdash;the
      raft itself of boards sawed at Waterville, and laden with square bundles
      of shingles and round bundles of clapboards. "Friend," says one man, "how
      is the tide now?"&mdash;this being important to the onward progress. They
      make fast to a tree, in order to wait for the tide to rise a little
      higher. It would be pleasant enough to float down the Kennebec on one of
      these rafts, letting the river conduct you onward at its own pace,
      leisurely displaying to you all the wild or ordered beauties along its
      banks, and perhaps running you aground in some peculiarly picturesque
      spot, for your longer enjoyment of it. Another object, perhaps, is a
      solitary man paddling himself down the river in a small canoe, the light,
      lonely touch of his paddle in the water making the silence seem deeper.
      Every few minutes a sturgeon leaps forth, sometimes behind you, so that
      you merely hear the splash, and, turning hastily around, see nothing but
      the disturbed water. Sometimes he darts straight on end out of a quiet
      black spot on which your eyes happen to be fixed, and, when even his tail
      is clear of the surface, he falls down on his side and disappears.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the river-bank, an Irishwoman washing some clothes, surrounded by her
      children, whose babbling sounds pleasantly along the edge of the shore;
      and she also answers in a sweet, kindly, and cheerful voice, though an
      immoral woman, and without the certainty of bread or shelter from day to
      day. An Irishman sitting angling on the brink with an alder pole and a
      clothes-line. At frequent intervals, the scene is suddenly broken by a
      loud report like thunder, rolling along the banks, echoing and
      reverberating afar. It is a blast of rocks. Along the margin, sometimes
      sticks of timber made fast, either separately or several together; stones
      of some size, varying the pebbles and sand; a clayey spot, where a shallow
      brook runs into the river, not with a deep outlet, but finding its way
      across the bank in two or three single runlets. Looking upward into the
      deep glen whence it issues, you see its shady current. Elsewhere, a high
      acclivity, with the beach between it and the river, the ridge broken and
      caved away, so that the earth looks fresh and yellow, and is penetrated by
      the nests of birds. An old, shining tree-trunk, half in and half out of
      the water. An island of gravel, long and narrow, in the centre of the
      river. Chips, blocks of wood, slabs, and other scraps of lumber, strewed
      along the beach; logs drifting down. The high bank covered with various
      trees and shrubbery, and, in one place, two or three Irish shanties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thursday, July 20th.&mdash;A drive yesterday afternoon to a pond in the
      vicinity of Augusta, about nine miles off, to fish for white perch.
      Remarkables: the steering of the boat through the crooked, labyrinthine
      brook, into the open pond,&mdash;the man who acted as pilot,&mdash;his
      talking with B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; about politics, the bank, the iron
      money of "a king who came to reign, in Greece, over a city called Sparta,"&mdash;his
      advice to B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; to come amongst the laborers on the
      mill-dam, because it stimulated them "to see a man grinning amongst them."
      The man took hearty tugs at a bottle of good Scotch whiskey, and became
      pretty merry. The fish caught were the yellow perch, which are not
      esteemed for eating; the white perch, a beautiful, silvery, round-backed
      fish, which bites eagerly, runs about with the line while being pulled up,
      makes good sport for the angler, and an admirable dish; a great chub; and
      three horned pouts, which swallow the hook into their lowest entrails.
      Several dozen fish were taken in an hour or two, and then we returned to
      the shop where we had left our horse and wagon, the pilot very eccentric
      behind us. It was a small, dingy shop, dimly lighted by a single inch of
      candle, faintly disclosing various boxes, barrels standing on end,
      articles hanging from the ceiling; the proprietor at the counter, whereon
      appear gin and brandy, respectively contained in a tin pint-measure and an
      earthenware jug, with two or three tumblers beside them, out of which
      nearly all the party drank; some coming up to the counter frankly, others
      lingering in the background, waiting to be pressed, two paying for their
      own liquor and withdrawing. B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; treated them twice
      round. The pilot, after drinking his brandy, gave a history of our fishing
      expedition, and how many and how large fish we caught. B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      making acquaintances and renewing them, and gaining great credit for
      liberality and free-heartedness,&mdash;two or three boys looking on and
      listening to the talk,&mdash;the shopkeeper smiling behind his counter,
      with the tarnished tin scales beside him,&mdash;the inch of candle burning
      down almost to extinction. So we got into our wagon, with the fish, and
      drove to Robinson's tavern, almost five miles off, where we supped and
      passed the night. In the bar-room was a fat old countryman on a journey,
      and a quack doctor of the vicinity, and an Englishman with a peculiar
      accent. Seeing B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s jointed and brass-mounted
      fishing-pole, he took it for a theodolite, and supposed that we had been
      on a surveying expedition. At supper, which consisted of bread, butter,
      cheese, cake, doughnuts, and gooseberry-pie, we were waited upon by a
      tall, very tall woman, young and maiden-looking, yet with a strongly
      outlined and determined face. Afterwards we found her to be the wife of
      mine host. She poured out our tea, came in when we rang the table-bell to
      refill our cups, and again retired. While at supper, the fat old traveller
      was ushered through the room into a contiguous bedroom. My own chamber,
      apparently the best in the house, had its walls ornamented with a small,
      gilt-framed, foot-square looking-glass, with a hairbrush hanging beneath
      it; a record of the deaths of the family written on a black tomb, in an
      engraving, where a father, mother, and child were represented in a
      graveyard, weeping over said tomb; the mourners dressed in black,
      country-cut clothes; the engraving executed in Vermont. There was also a
      wood engraving of the Declaration of Independence, with fac-similes of the
      autographs; a portrait of the Empress Josephine, and another of Spring. In
      the two closets of this chamber were mine hostess's cloak, best bonnet,
      and go-to-meeting apparel. There was a good bed, in which I slept
      tolerably well, and, rising betimes, ate breakfast, consisting of some of
      our own fish, and then started for Augusta. The fat old traveller had gone
      off with the harness of our wagon, which the hostler had put on to his
      horse by mistake. The tavern-keeper gave us his own harness, and started
      in pursuit of the old man, who was probably aware of the exchange, and
      well satisfied with it.

      Our drive to Augusta, six or seven miles, was very pleasant, a heavy rain
      having fallen during the night, and laid the oppressive dust of the day
      before. The road lay parallel with the Kennebec, of which we occasionally
      had near glimpses. The country swells back from the river in hills and
      ridges, without any interval of level ground; and there were frequent
      woods, filling up the valleys or crowning the summits. The land is good,
      the farms look neat, and the houses comfortable. The latter are generally
      but of one story, but with large barns; and it was a good sign, that,
      while we saw no houses unfinished nor out of repair, one man at least had
      found it expedient to make an addition to his dwelling. At the distance of
      more than two miles, we had a view of white Augusta, with its steeples,
      and the State-House, at the farther end of the town. Observable matters
      along the road were the stage,&mdash;all the dust of yesterday brushed
      off, and no new dust contracted,&mdash;full of passengers, inside and out;
      among them some gentlemanly people and pretty girls, all looking fresh and
      unsullied, rosy, cheerful, and curious as to the face of the country, the
      faces of passing travellers, and the incidents of their journey; not yet
      damped, in the morning sunshine, by long miles of jolting over rough and
      hilly roads,&mdash;to compare this with their appearance at midday, and as
      they drive into Bangor at dusk;&mdash;two women dashing along in a wagon,
      and with a child, rattling pretty speedily down hill;&mdash;people looking
      at us from the open doors and windows;&mdash;the children staring from the
      wayside;&mdash;the mowers stopping, for a moment, the sway of their
      scythes;&mdash;the matron of a family, indistinctly seen at some distance
      within the house, her head and shoulders appearing through the window,
      drawing her handkerchief over her bosom, which had been uncovered to give
      the baby its breakfast,&mdash;the said baby, or its immediate predecessor,
      sitting at the door, turning round to creep away on all fours;&mdash;a man
      building a flat-bottomed boat by the roadside: he talked with B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      about the Boundary question, and swore fervently in favor of driving the
      British "into hell's kitchen" by main force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, the engineer of the mill-dam, is now here,
      after about a fortnight's absence. He is a plain country squire, with a
      good figure, but with rather a heavy brow; a rough complexion; a gait
      stiff, and a general rigidity of manner, something like that of a
      schoolmaster. He originated in a country town, and is a self-educated man.
      As he walked down the gravel-path to-day, after dinner, he took up a
      scythe, which one of the mowers had left on the sward, and began to mow,
      with quite a scientific swing. On the coming of the mower, he laid it
      down, perhaps a little ashamed of his amusement. I was interested in this;
      to see a man, after twenty-five years of scientific occupation, thus
      trying whether his arms retained their strength and skill for the labors
      of his youth,&mdash; mindful of the day when he wore striped trousers, and
      toiled in his shirt-sleeves,&mdash;and now tasting again, for pastime,
      this drudgery beneath a fervid sun. He stood awhile, looking at the
      workmen, and then went to oversee the laborers at the mill-dam.

      Monday, July, 24th.&mdash;I bathed in the river on Thursday evening, and
      in the brook at the old dam on Saturday and Sunday,&mdash;the former time
      at noon. The aspect of the solitude at noon was peculiarly impressive,
      there being a cloudless sunshine, no wind, no rustling of the
      forest-leaves, no waving of the boughs, no noise but the brawling and
      babbling of the stream, making its way among the stones, and pouring in a
      little cataract round one side of the mouldering dam. Looking up the
      brook, there was a long vista,&mdash;now ripples, now smooth and glassy
      spaces, now large rocks, almost blocking up the channel; while the trees
      stood upon either side, mostly straight, but here and there a branch
      thrusting itself out irregularly, and one tree, a pine, leaning over,&mdash;
      not bending,&mdash;but leaning at an angle over the brook, rough and
      ragged; birches, alders; the tallest of all the trees an old, dead,
      leafless pine, rising white and lonely, though closely surrounded by
      others. Along the brook, now the grass and herbage extended close to the
      water; now a small, sandy beach. The wall of rock before described,
      looking as if it had been hewn, but with irregular strokes of the workman,
      doing his job by rough and ponderous strength,&mdash;now chancing to hew
      it away smoothly and cleanly, now carelessly smiting, and making gaps, or
      piling on the slabs of rock, so as to leave vacant spaces. In the
      interstices grow brake and broad-leaved forest-grass. The trees that
      spring from the top of this wall have their roots pressing close to the
      rock, so that there is no soil between; they cling powerfully, and grasp
      the crag tightly with their knotty fingers. The trees on both sides are so
      thick, that the sight and the thoughts are almost immediately lost among
      confused stems, branches, and clustering green leaves,&mdash;a narrow
      strip of bright blue sky above, the sunshine falling lustrously down, and
      making the pathway of the brook luminous below. Entering among the
      thickets, I find the soil strewn with old leaves of preceding seasons,
      through which may be seen a black or dark mould; the roots of trees
      stretch frequently across the path; often a moss-grown brown log lies
      athwart, and when you set your foot down, it sinks into the decaying
      substance,&mdash;into the heart of oak or pine. The leafy boughs and twigs
      of the underbrush enlace themselves before you, so that you must stoop
      your head to pass under, or thrust yourself through amain, while they
      sweep against your face, and perhaps knock off your hat. There are rocks
      mossy and slippery; sometimes you stagger, with a great rustling of
      branches, against a clump of bushes, and into the midst of it. From end to
      end of all this tangled shade goes a pathway scarcely worn, for the leaves
      are not trodden through, yet plain enough to the eye, winding gently to
      avoid tree-trunks and rocks and little hillocks. In the more open ground,
      the aspect of a tall, fire-blackened stump, standing alone, high up on a
      swell of land, that rises gradually from one side of the brook, like a
      monument. Yesterday, I passed a group of children in this solitary valley,&mdash;two
      boys, I think, and two girls. One of the little girls seemed to have
      suffered some wrong from her companions, for she was weeping and
      complaining violently. Another time, I came suddenly on a small Canadian
      boy, who was in a hollow place, among the ruined logs of an old causeway,
      picking raspberries,&mdash;lonely among bushes and gorges, far up the wild
      valley,&mdash;and the lonelier seemed the little boy for the bright
      sunshine, that showed no one else in a wide space of view except him and
      me.

      Remarkable items: the observation of Mons. S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; when B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      was saying something against the character of the French people,&mdash;"You
      ought not to form an unfavorable judgment of a great nation from mean
      fellows like me, strolling about in a foreign country." I thought it very
      noble thus to protest against anything discreditable in himself personally
      being used against the honor of his country. He is a very singular person,
      with an originality in all his notions;&mdash;not that nobody has ever had
      such before, but that he has thought them out for himself. He told me
      yesterday that one of his sisters was a waiting-maid in the Rocher de
      Cancale. He is about the sincerest man I ever knew, never pretending to
      feelings that are not in him,&mdash;never flattering. His feelings do not
      seem to be warm, though they are kindly. He is so single-minded that he
      cannot understand badinage, but takes it all as if meant in earnest,&mdash;a
      German trait. He values himself greatly on being a Frenchman, though all
      his most valuable qualities come from Germany. His temperament is cool and
      pure, and he is greatly delighted with any attentions from the ladies. A
      short time since, a lady gave him a bouquet of roses and pinks; he capered
      and danced and sang, put it in water, and carried it to his own chamber;
      but he brought it out for us to see and admire two or three times a day,
      bestowing on it all the epithets of admiration in the French language,&mdash;"Superbe!
      magnifique!" When some of the flowers began to fade, he made the rest,
      with others, into a new nosegay, and consulted us whether it would be fit
      to give to another lady. Contrast this French foppery with his solemn
      moods, when we sit in the twilight, or after B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; is
      abed, talking of Christianity and Deism, of ways of life, of marriage, of
      benevolence,&mdash;in short, of all deep matters of this world and the
      next. An evening or two since, he began singing all manner of English
      songs,&mdash;such as Mrs. Hemans's "Landing of the Pilgrims," "Auld Lang
      Syne," and some of Moore's,&mdash;the singing pretty fair, but in the
      oddest tone and accent. Occasionally he breaks out with scraps from French
      tragedies, which he spouts with corresponding action. He generally gets
      close to me in these displays of musical and histrionic talent. Once he
      offered to magnetize me in the manner of Monsieur P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.

      Wednesday, July 26th.&mdash;Dined at Barker's yesterday. Before dinner,
      sat with several other persons in the stoop of the tavern. There were B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      J. A. Chandler, Clerk of the Court, a man of middle age or beyond, two or
      three stage people, and, near by, a negro, whom they call "the Doctor," a
      crafty-looking fellow, one of whose occupations is nameless. In presence
      of this goodly company, a man of a depressed, neglected air, a soft,
      simple-looking fellow, with an anxious expression, in a laborer's dress,
      approached and inquired for Mr. Barker. Mine host being gone to Portland,
      the stranger was directed to the bar-keeper, who stood at the door. The
      man asked where he should find one Mary Ann Russell,&mdash;a question
      which excited general and hardly suppressed mirth; for the said Mary Ann
      is one of a knot of women who were routed on Sunday evening by Barker and
      a constable. The man was told that the black fellow would give him all the
      information he wanted. The black fellow asked,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you want to see her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Others of the by-standers or by-sitters put various questions as to the
      nature of the man's business with Mary Ann. One asked,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is she your daughter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, a little nearer than that, I calkilate," said the poor devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the mirth was increased, it being evident that the woman was his
      wife. The man seemed too simple and obtuse to comprehend the ridicule of
      his situation, or to be rendered very miserable by it. Nevertheless, he
      made some touching points.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man generally places some little dependence on his wife," said he,
      "whether she's good or not." He meant, probably, that he rests some
      affection on her. He told us that she had behaved well, till committed to
      jail for striking a child; and I believe he was absent from home at the
      time, and had not seen her since. And now he was in search of her,
      intending, doubtless, to do his best to get her out of her troubles, and
      then to take her back to his home. Some advised him not to look after her;
      others recommended him to pay "the Doctor" aforesaid for guiding him to
      her; which finally "the Doctor" did, in consideration of a treat; and the
      fellow went off, having heard little but gibes and not one word of
      sympathy! I would like to have witnessed his meeting with his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moral picturesqueness in the contrasts of the scene,&mdash;a
      man moved as deeply as his nature would admit, in the midst of hardened,
      gibing spectators, heartless towards him. It is worth thinking over and
      studying out. He seemed rather hurt and pricked by the jests thrown at
      him, yet bore it patiently, and sometimes almost joined in the laugh,
      being of an easy, unenergetic temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hints for characters:&mdash;Nancy, a pretty, black-eyed, intelligent
      servant-girl, living in Captain H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s family. She comes
      daily to make the beds in our part of the house, and exchanges a
      good-morning with me, in a pleasant voice, and with a glance and smile,&mdash;somewhat
      shy, because we are not acquainted, yet capable of being made conversable.
      She washes once a week, and may be seen standing over her tub, with her
      handkerchief somewhat displaced from her white neck, because it is hot.
      Often she stands with her bare arms in the water, talking with Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      or looks through the window, perhaps, at B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, or
      somebody else crossing the yard,&mdash;rather thoughtfully, but soon
      smiling or laughing. Then goeth she for a pail of water. In the afternoon,
      very probably, she dresses herself in silks, looking not only pretty, but
      lady-like, and strolls round the house, not unconscious that some
      gentleman may be staring at her from behind the green blinds. After
      supper, she walks to the village. Morning and evening, she goes a-milking.
      And thus passes her life, cheerfully, usefully, virtuously, with hopes,
      doubtless, of a husband and children.&mdash;Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; is
      a particularly plump, soft-fleshed, fair-complexioned, comely woman
      enough, with rather a simple countenance, not nearly so piquant as
      Nancy's. Her walk has something of the roll or waddle of a fat woman,
      though it were too much to call her fat. She seems to be a sociable body,
      probably laughter-loving. Captain H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; himself has
      commanded a steamboat, and has a certain knowledge of life.

      Query, in relation to the man's missing wife, how much desire and
      resolution of doing her duty by her husband can a wife retain, while
      injuring him in what is deemed the most essential point?

      Observation. The effect of morning sunshine on the wet grass, on sloping
      and swelling land, between the spectator and the sun at some distance, as
      across a lawn. It diffused a dim brilliancy over the whole surface of the
      field. The mists, slow-rising farther off, part resting on the earth, the
      remainder of the column already ascending so high that you doubt whether
      to call it a fog or a cloud.

      Friday, July 28th.&mdash;Saw my classmate and formerly intimate friend,
      &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, for the first time since we graduated. He has met
      with good success in life, in spite of circumstance, having struggled
      upward against bitter opposition, by the force of his own abilities, to be
      a member of Congress, after having been for some time the leader of his
      party in the State Legislature. We met like old friends, and conversed
      almost as freely as we used to do in college days, twelve years ago and
      more. He is a singular person, shrewd, crafty, insinuating, with wonderful
      tact, seizing on each man by his manageable point, and using him for his
      own purpose, often without the man's suspecting that he is made a tool of;
      and yet, artificial as his character would seem to be, his conversation,
      at least to myself, was full of natural feeling, the expression of which
      can hardly be mistaken, and his revelations with regard to himself had
      really a great deal of frankness. He spoke of his ambition, of the
      obstacles which he had encountered, of the means by which he had overcome
      them, imputing great efficacy to his personal intercourse with people, and
      his study of their characters; then of his course as a member of the
      Legislature and Speaker, and his style of speaking and its effects; of the
      dishonorable things which had been imputed to him, and in what manner he
      had repelled the charges. In short, he would seem to have opened himself
      very freely as to his public life. Then, as to his private affairs, he
      spoke of his marriage, of his wife, his children, and told me, with tears
      in his eyes, of the death of a dear little girl, and how it affected him,
      and how impossible it had been for him to believe that she was really to
      die. A man of the most open nature might well have been more reserved to a
      friend, after twelve years' separation, than &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; was to
      me. Nevertheless, he is really a crafty man, concealing, like a
      murder-secret, anything that it is not good for him to have known. He by
      no means feigns the good-feeling that he professes, nor is there anything
      affected in the frankness of his conversation; and it is this that makes
      him so very fascinating. There is such a quantity of truth and kindliness
      and warm affections, that a man's heart opens to him, in spite of himself.
      He deceives by truth. And not only is he crafty, but, when occasion
      demands, bold and fierce as a tiger, determined, and even straightforward
      and undisguised in his measures,&mdash;a daring fellow as well as a sly
      one. Yet, notwithstanding his consummate art, the general estimate of his
      character seems to be pretty just. Hardly anybody, probably, thinks him
      better than he is, and many think him worse. Nevertheless, if no
      overwhelming discovery of rascality be made, he will always possess
      influence; though I should hardly think that he would take any prominent
      part in Congress. As to any rascality, I rather believe that he has
      thought out for himself a much higher system of morality than any natural
      integrity would have prompted him to adopt; that he has seen the thorough
      advantage of morality and honesty; and the sentiment of these qualities
      has now got into his mind and spirit, and pretty well impregnated them. I
      believe him to be about as honest as the great run of the world, with
      something even approaching to high-mindedness. His person in some degree
      accords with his character,&mdash;thin and with a thin face, sharp
      features, sallow, a projecting brow not very high, deep-set eyes, an
      insinuating smile and look, when he meets you, and is about to address
      you. I should think that he would do away with this peculiar expression,
      for it reveals more of himself than can be detected in any other way, in
      personal intercourse with him. Upon the whole, I have quite a good liking
      for him, and mean to go to&mdash;to see him.

      Observation. A steam-engine across the river, which almost continually
      during the day, and sometimes all night, may be heard puffing and panting,
      as if it uttered groans for being compelled to labor in the heat and
      sunshine, and when the world is asleep also.

      Monday, July 31st.&mdash;Nothing remarkable to record. A child asleep in a
      young lady's arms,&mdash;a little baby, two or three months old. Whenever
      anything partially disturbed the child, as, for instance, when the young
      lady or a bystander patted its cheek or rubbed its chin, the child would
      smile; then all its dreams seemed to be of pleasure and happiness. At
      first the smile was so faint, that I doubted whether it were really a
      smile or no; but on further efforts, it brightened forth very decidedly.
      This, without opening its eyes.&mdash;A constable, a homely, good-natured,
      business-looking man, with a warrant against an Irishman's wife for
      throwing a brickbat at a fellow. He gave good advice to the Irishman about
      the best method of coming easiest through the affair. Finally settled,&mdash;the
      justice agreeing to relinquish his fees, on condition that the Irishman
      would pay for the mending of his old boots!

      I went with Monsieur S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; yesterday to pick raspberries.
      He fell through an old log bridge thrown over a hollow; looking back, only
      his head and shoulders appeared through the rotten logs and among the
      bushes.&mdash;A shower coming on, the rapid running of a little barefooted
      boy, coming up unheard, and dashing swiftly past us, and showing the soles
      of his naked feet as he ran adown the path, and up the opposite rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tuesday, August 1st.&mdash;There having been a heavy rain yesterday, a
      nest of chimney-swallows was washed down the chimney into the fireplace of
      one of the front rooms. My attention was drawn to them by a most
      obstreperous twittering; and looking behind the fireboard, there were
      three young birds, clinging with their feet against one of the jambs,
      looking at me, open-mouthed, and all clamoring together, so as quite to
      fill the room with the short, eager, frightened sound. The old birds, by
      certain signs upon the floor of the room, appeared to have fallen victims
      to the appetite of the cat. La belle Nancy provided a basket filled with
      cotton-wool, into which the poor little devils were put; and I tried to
      feed them with soaked bread, of which, however, they did not eat with much
      relish. Tom, the Irish boy, gave it as his opinion that they were not old
      enough to be weaned. I hung the basket out of the window, in the sunshine,
      and upon looking in, an hour or two after, found that two of the birds had
      escaped. The other I tried to feed, and sometimes, when a morsel of bread
      was thrust into its open mouth, it would swallow it. But it appeared to
      suffer very much, vociferating loudly when disturbed, and panting, in a
      sluggish agony, with eyes closed, or half opened, when let alone. It
      distressed me a good deal; and I felt relieved, though somewhat shocked,
      when B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; put an end to its misery by squeezing its head
      and throwing it out of the window. They were of a slate-color, and might,
      I suppose, have been able to shift for themselves.&mdash;The other day a
      little yellow bird flew into one of the empty rooms, of which there are
      half a dozen on the lower floor, and could not find his way out again,
      flying at the glass of the windows, instead of at the door, thumping his
      head against the panes or against the ceiling. I drove him into the entry
      and chased him from end to end, endeavoring to make him fly through one of
      the open doors. He would fly at the circular light over the door, clinging
      to the casement, sometimes alighting on one of the two glass lamps, or on
      the cords that suspended them, uttering an affrighted and melancholy cry
      whenever I came near and flapped my handkerchief, and appearing quite
      tired and sinking into despair. At last he happened to fly low enough to
      pass through the door, and immediately vanished into the gladsome
      sunshine.&mdash;Ludicrous situation of a man, drawing his chaise down a
      sloping bank, to wash in the river. The chaise got the better of him, and,
      rushing downward as if it were possessed, compelled him to run at full
      speed, and drove him up to his chin into the water. A singular instance,
      that a chaise may run away with a man without a horse!

      Saturday, August 12th.&mdash;Left Augusta a week ago this morning for
      &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. Nothing particular in our drive across the country.
      Fellow-passenger a Boston dry-goods dealer, travelling to collect bills.
      At many of the country shops he would get out, and show his unwelcome
      visage. In the tavern, prints from Scripture, varnished and on rollers,&mdash;such
      as the Judgment of Christ; also a droll set of colored engravings of the
      story of the Prodigal Son, the figures being clad in modern costume,&mdash;or,
      at least, that of not more than half a century ago. The father, a grave,
      clerical person, with a white wig and black broadcloth suit; the son, with
      a cocked hat and laced clothes, drinking wine out of a glass, and
      caressing a woman in fashionable dress. At &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; a nice,
      comfortable boarding-house tavern, without a bar or any sort of wines or
      spirits. An old lady from Boston, with her three daughters, one of whom
      was teaching music, and the other two schoolmistresses. A frank, free,
      mirthful daughter of the landlady, about twenty-four years old, between
      whom and myself there immediately sprang up a flirtation, which made us
      both feel rather melancholy when we parted on Tuesday morning. Music in
      the evening, with a song by a rather pretty, fantastic little mischief of
      a brunette, about eighteen years old, who has married within a year, and
      spent the last summer in a trip to the Springs and elsewhere. Her manner
      of walking is by jerks, with a quiver, as if she were made of calves-feet
      jelly. I talk with everybody: to Mrs. T&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; good sense,&mdash;to
      Mary, good sense, with a mixture of fun,&mdash;to Mrs. G&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      sentiment, romance, and nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walked with &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; to see General Knox's old mansion,&mdash;a
      large, rusty-looking edifice of wood, with some grandeur in the
      architecture, standing on the banks of the river, close by the site of an
      old burial-ground, and near where an ancient fort had been erected for
      defence against the French and Indians. General Knox once owned a square
      of thirty miles in this part of the country, and he wished to settle it
      with a tenantry, after the fashion of English gentlemen. He would permit
      no edifice to be erected within a certain distance of his mansion. His
      patent covered, of course, the whole present town of Waldoborough and
      divers other flourishing commercial and country villages, and would have
      been of incalculable value could it have remained unbroken to the present
      time. But the General lived in grand style, and received throngs of
      visitors from foreign parts, and was obliged to part with large tracts of
      his possessions, till now there is little left but the ruinous mansion and
      the ground immediately around it. His tomb stands near the house,&mdash;a
      spacious receptacle, an iron door at the end of a turf-covered mound, and
      surmounted by an obelisk of marble. There are inscriptions to the memory
      of several of his family; for he had many children, all of whom are now
      dead, except one daughter, a widow of fifty, recently married to Hon. John
      H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. There is a stone fence round the monument. On the
      outside of this are the gravestones, and large, flat tombstones of the
      ancient burial-ground,&mdash;the tombstones being of red freestone, with
      vacant spaces, formerly inlaid with slate, on which were the inscriptions,
      and perhaps coats-of-arms. One of these spaces was in the shape of a
      heart. The people were very wrathful that the General should have laid out
      his grounds over this old burial-place; and he dared never throw down the
      gravestones, though his wife, a haughty English lady, often teased him to
      do so. But when the old General was dead, Lady Knox (as they called her)
      caused them to be prostrated, as they now lie. She was a woman of violent
      passions, and so proud an aristocrat, that, as long as she lived, she
      would never enter any house in the town except her own. When a married
      daughter was ill, she used to go in her carriage to the door, and send up
      to inquire how she did. The General was personally very popular; but his
      wife ruled him. The house and its vicinity, and the whole tract covered by
      Knox's patent, may be taken as an illustration of what must be the result
      of American schemes of aristocracy. It is not forty years since this house
      was built, and Knox was in his glory; but now the house is all in decay,
      while within a stone's-throw of it there is a street of smart white
      edifices of one and two stories, occupied chiefly by thriving mechanics,
      which has been laid out where Knox meant to have forests and parks. On the
      banks of the river, where he intended to have only one wharf for his own
      West Indian vessels and yacht, there are two wharves, with stores and a
      lime kiln. Little appertains to the mansion except the tomb and the old
      burial-ground, and the old fort.

    <p>
      The descendants are all poor, and the inheritance was merely sufficient to
      make a dissipated and drunken fellow of the only one of the old General's
      sons who survived to middle age. The man's habits were as bad as possible
      as long as he had any money; but when quite ruined, he reformed. The
      daughter, the only survivor among Knox's children (herself childless), is
      a mild, amiable woman, therein totally differing from her mother. Knox,
      when he first visited his estate, arriving in a vessel, was waited upon by
      a deputation of the squatters, who had resolved to resist him to the
      death. He received them with genial courtesy, made them dine with him
      aboard the vessel, and sent them back to their constituents in great love
      and admiration of him. He used to have a vessel running to Philadelphia, I
      think, and bringing him all sorts of delicacies. His way of raising money
      was to give a mortgage on his estate of a hundred thousand dollars at a
      time, and receive that nominal amount in goods, which he would immediately
      sell at auction for perhaps thirty thousand. He died by a chicken-bone.
      Near the house are the remains of a covered way, by which the French once
      attempted to gain admittance into the fort; but the work caved in and
      buried a good many of them, and the rest gave up the siege. There was
      recently an old inhabitant living who remembered when the people used to
      reside in the fort.

    <p>
      Owl's Head,&mdash;a watering-place, terminating a point of land, six or
      seven miles from Thomaston. A long island shuts out the prospect of the
      sea. Hither coasters and fishing-smacks run in when a storm is
      anticipated. Two fat landlords, both young men, with something of a
      contrast in their dispositions; one of them being a brisk, lively, active,
      jesting, fat man; the other more heavy and inert, making jests sluggishly,
      if at all. Aboard the steamboat, Professor Stuart of Andover, sitting on a
      sofa in the saloon, generally in conversation with some person, resolving
      their doubts on one point or another, speaking in a very audible voice;
      and strangers standing or sitting around to hear him, as if he were an
      ancient apostle or philosopher. He is a bulky man, with a large, massive
      face, particularly calm in its expression, and mild enough to be pleasing.
      When not otherwise occupied, he reads, without much notice of what is
      going on around him. He speaks without effort, yet thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      We got lost in a fog the morning after leaving Owl's Head. Fired a brass
      cannon, rang bell, blew steam, like a whale snorting. After one of the
      reports of the cannon, we heard a horn blown at no great distance, the
      sound coming soon after the report. Doubtful whether it came from the
      shore or a vessel. Continued our ringing and snorting; and by and by
      something was seen to mingle with the fog that obscured everything beyond
      fifty yards from us. At first it seemed only like a denser wreath of fog;
      it darkened still more, till it took the aspect of sails; then the hull of
      a small schooner came beating down towards us, the wind laying her over
      towards us, so that her gunwale was almost in the water, and we could see
      the whole of her sloping deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Schooner ahoy!" say we. "Halloo! Have you seen Boston Light this
      morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; it bears north-northwest, two miles distant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very much obliged to you," cries our captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the schooner vanishes into the mist behind. We get up our steam, and
      soon enter the harbor, meeting vessels of every rig; and the fog, clearing
      away, shows a cloudy sky. Aboard, an old one-eyed sailor, who had lost one
      of his feet, and had walked on the stump from Eastport to Bangor, thereby
      making a shocking ulcer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penobscot Bay is full of islands, close to which the steamboat is
      continually passing. Some are large, with portions of forest and portions
      of cleared land; some are mere rocks, with a little green or none, and
      inhabited by sea-birds, which fly and flap about hoarsely. Their eggs may
      be gathered by the bushel, and are good to eat. Other islands have one
      house and barn on them, this sole family being lords and rulers of all the
      land which the sea girds. The owner of such an island must have a peculiar
      sense of property and lordship; he must feel more like his own master and
      his own man than other people can. Other islands, perhaps high,
      precipitous, black bluffs, are crowned with a white lighthouse, whence, as
      evening comes on, twinkles a star across the melancholy deep,&mdash;seen
      by vessels coming on the coast, seen from the mainland, seen from island
      to island. Darkness descending, and, looking down at the broad wake left
      by the wheels of the steamboat, we may see sparkles of sea-fire glittering
      through the gloom.

      Salem, August 22d.&mdash;A walk yesterday afternoon down to the Juniper
      and Winter Island. Singular effect of partial sunshine, the sky being
      broadly and heavily clouded, and land and sea, in consequence, being
      generally overspread with a sombre gloom. But the sunshine, somehow or
      other, found its way between the interstices of the clouds, and
      illuminated some of the distant objects very vividly. The white sails of a
      ship caught it, and gleamed brilliant as sunny snow, the hull being
      scarcely visible, and the sea around dark; other smaller vessels too, so
      that they looked like heavenly-winged things, just alighting on a dismal
      world. Shifting their sails, perhaps, or going on another tack, they
      almost disappear at once in the obscure distance. Islands are seen in
      summer sunshine and green glory; their rocks also sunny and their beaches
      white; while other islands, for no apparent reason, are in deep shade, and
      share the gloom of the rest of the world. Sometimes part of an island is
      illuminated and part dark. When the sunshine falls on a very distant
      island, nearer ones being in shade, it seems greatly to extend the bounds
      of visible space, and put the horizon to a farther distance. The sea
      roughly rushing against the shore, and dashing against the rocks, and
      grating back over the sands. A boat a little way from the shore, tossing
      and swinging at anchor. Beach birds flitting from place to place.

      The family seat of the Hawthornes is Wigcastle, Wigton, Wiltshire. The

      A young man and girl meet together, each in search of a person to be known

      that the other is waiting for. Moral,&mdash;that what we need for our

      A man tries to be happy in love; he cannot sincerely give his heart, and

      In the cabinet of the Essex Historical Society, old portraits.&mdash;Governor
      Leverett; a dark mustachioed face, the figure two-thirds length, clothed
      in a sort of frock-coat, buttoned, and a broad sword-belt girded round the
      waist, and fastened with a large steel buckle; the hilt of the sword
      steel,&mdash;altogether very striking. Sir William Pepperell, in English
      regimentals, coat, waistcoat, and breeches, all of red broadcloth, richly
      gold-embroidered; he holds a general's truncheon in his right hand, and
      extends the left towards the batteries erected against Louisbourg, in the
      country near which he is standing. Endicott, Pyncheon, and others, in
      scarlet robes, bands, etc. Half a dozen or more family portraits of the
      Olivers, some in plain dresses brown, crimson, or claret; others with
      gorgeous gold-embroidered waistcoats, descending almost to the knees, so
      as to form the most conspicuous article of dress. Ladies, with lace
      ruffles, the painting of which, in one of the pictures, cost five guineas.
      Peter Oliver, who was crazy, used to fight with these family pictures in
      the old Mansion House; and the face and breast of one lady bear cuts and
      stabs inflicted by him. Miniatures in oil, with the paint peeling off, of
      stern, old, yellow faces. Oliver Cromwell, apparently an old picture, half
      length, or one third, in an oval frame, probably painted for some New
      England partisan. Some pictures that had been partly obliterated by
      scrubbing with sand. The dresses, embroidery, laces of the Oliver family
      are generally better done than the faces. Governor Leverett's gloves,&mdash;the
      glove part of coarse leather, but round the wrist a deep, three or four
      inch border of spangles and silver embroidery. Old drinking-glasses, with
      tall stalks. A black glass bottle, stamped with the name of Philip
      English, with a broad bottom. The baby-linen, etc., of Governor Bradford
      of Plymouth County. Old manuscript sermons, some written in short-hand,
      others in a hand that seems learnt from print.

      Nothing gives a stronger idea of old worm-eaten aristocracy&mdash;of a
      family being crazy with age, and of its being time that it was extinct&mdash;than
      these black, dusty, faded, antique-dressed portraits, such as those of the
      Oliver family; the identical old white wig of an ancient minister
      producing somewhat the impression that his very scalp, or some other
      portion of his personal self, would do.

      Monday, August 27th.&mdash;Went to Boston last Wednesday. Remarkables:&mdash;An
      author at the American Stationers' Company, slapping his hand on his
      manuscript, and crying, "I'm going to publish."&mdash;An excursion aboard
      a steamboat to Thompson's Island, to visit the Manual Labor School for
      boys. Aboard the steamboat several poets and various other authors; a
      Commodore,&mdash;Colton, a small, dark brown, sickly man, with a good deal
      of roughness in his address; Mr. Waterston, talking poetry and philosophy.
      Examination and exhibition of the boys, little tanned agriculturists.
      After examination, a stroll round the island, examining the products, as
      wheat in sheaves on the stubble-field; oats, somewhat blighted and
      spoiled; great pumpkins elsewhere; pastures; mowing ground;&mdash;all
      cultivated by the boys. Their residence, a great brick building, painted
      green, and standing on the summit of a rising ground, exposed to the winds
      of the bay. Vessels flitting past; great ships, with intricacy of rigging
      and various sails; schooners, sloops, with their one or two broad sheets
      of canvas: going on different tacks, so that the spectator might think
      that there was a different wind for each vessel, or that they scudded
      across the sea spontaneously, whither their own wills led them. The farm
      boys remain insulated, looking at the passing show, within sight of the
      city, yet having nothing to do with it; beholding their fellow-creatures
      skimming by them in winged machines, and steamboats snorting and puffing
      through the waves. Methinks an island would be the most desirable of all
      landed property, for it seems like a little world by itself; and the water
      may answer instead of the atmosphere that surrounds planets. The boys
      swinging, two together, standing up, and almost causing the ropes and
      their bodies to stretch out horizontally. On our departure, they ranged
      themselves on the rails of the fence, and, being dressed in blue, looked
      not unlike a flock of pigeons.

    <p>
      On Friday, a visit to the Navy Yard at Charlestown, in company with the
      Naval Officer of Boston, and Cilley. Dined aboard the revenue-cutter
      Hamilton. A pretty cabin, finished off with bird's-eye maple and mahogany;
      two looking-glasses. Two officers in blue frocks, with a stripe of lace on
      each shoulder. Dinner, chowder, fried fish, corned beef,&mdash;claret,
      afterwards champagne. The waiter tells the Captain of the cutter that
      Captain Percival (Commander of the Navy Yard) is sitting on the deck of
      the anchor boy (which lies inside of the cutter), smoking his cigar. The
      captain sends him a glass of champagne, and inquires of the waiter what
      Percival says to it. "He said, sir, `What does he send me this damned
      stuff for?' but drinks, nevertheless." The Captain characterizes Percival
      as the roughest old devil that ever was in his manners, but a kind,
      good-hearted man at bottom. By and by comes in the steward. "Captain
      Percival is coming aboard of you, sir." "Well, ask him to walk down into
      the cabin"; and shortly down comes old Captain Percival, a white-haired,
      thin-visaged, weather-worn old gentleman, in a blue, Quaker-cut coat, with
      tarnished lace and brass buttons, a pair of drab pantaloons, and brown
      waistcoat. There was an eccentric expression in his face, which seemed
      partly wilful, partly natural. He has not risen to his present rank in the
      regular line of the profession; but entered the navy as a sailing-master,
      and has all the roughness of that class of officers. Nevertheless, he
      knows how to behave and to talk like a gentleman. Sitting down, and taking
      in hand a glass of champagne, he began a lecture on economy, and how well
      it was that Uncle Sam had a broad back, being compelled to bear so many
      burdens as were laid on it,&mdash; alluding to the table covered with
      wine-bottles. Then he spoke of the fitting up of the cabin with expensive
      woods,&mdash;of the brooch in Captain Scott's bosom. Then he proceeded to
      discourse of politics, taking the opposite side to Cilley, and arguing
      with much pertinacity. He seems to have moulded and shaped himself to his
      own whims, till a sort of rough affectation has become thoroughly imbued
      throughout a kindly nature. He is full of antique prejudices against the
      modern fashions of the younger officers, their mustaches and such
      fripperies, and prophesies little better than disgrace in case of another
      war; owning that the boys would fight for their country, and die for her,
      but denying that there are any officers now like Hull and Stuart, whose
      exploits, nevertheless, he greatly depreciated, saying that the Boxer and
      Enterprise fought the only equal battle which we won during the war; and
      that, in that action, an officer had proposed to haul down the stars and
      stripes, and a common sailor threatened to cut him to pieces if he should
      do so. He spoke of Bainbridge as a sot and a poltroon, who wanted to run
      from the Macedonian, pretending to take her for a line-of-battle ship; of
      Commodore Elliot as a liar; but praised Commodore Downes in the highest
      terms. Percival seems to be the very pattern of old integrity; taking as
      much care of Uncle Sam's interests as if all the money expended were to
      come out of his own pocket. This quality was displayed in his resistance
      to the demand of a new patent capstan for the revenue-cutter, which,
      however, Scott is resolved in such a sailor-like way to get, that he will
      probably succeed. Percival spoke to me of how his business in the yard
      absorbed him, especially the fitting of the Columbus seventy-four, of
      which ship he discoursed with great enthusiasm. He seems to have no
      ambition beyond his present duties, perhaps never had any; at any rate, he
      now passes his life with a sort of gruff contentedness, grumbling and
      growling, yet in good humor enough. He is conscious of his peculiarities;
      for when I asked him whether it would be well to make a naval officer
      Secretary of the Navy, he said, "God forbid, for that an old sailor was
      always full of prejudices and stubborn whim-whams," instancing himself;
      whereto I agreed. We went round the Navy Yard with Percival and Commodore
      Downes, the latter a sailor and a gentleman too, with rather more of the
      ocean than the drawing-room about him, but courteous, frank, and
      good-natured. We looked at ropewalks, rigging-lofts, ships in the stocks;
      and saw the sailors of the station laughing and sporting with great mirth
      and cheerfulness, which the Commodore said was much increased at sea. We
      returned to the wharf at Boston in the cutter's boat. Captain Scott, of
      the cutter, told me a singular story of what occurred during the action
      between the Constitution and Macedonian&mdash;he being powder-monkey
      aboard the former ship. A cannon-shot came through the ship's side, and a
      man's head was struck off, probably by a splinter, for it was done without
      bruising the head or body, as clean as by a razor. Well, the man was
      walking pretty briskly at the time of the accident; and Scott seriously
      affirmed that he kept walking onward at the same pace, with two jets of
      blood gushing from his headless trunk, till, after going about twenty feet
      without a head, he sunk down at once, with his legs under him.

      On Saturday, I called to see E. H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, having previously
      appointed a meeting for the purpose of inquiring about our name. He is an
      old bachelor, and truly forlorn. The pride of ancestry seems to be his
      great hobby. He had a good many old papers in his desk at the
      Custom-House, which he produced and dissertated upon, and afterwards went
      with me to his sister's, and showed me an old book, with a record of the
      children of the first emigrant (who came over two hundred years ago), in
      his own handwriting. E&mdash;&mdash;'s manners are gentlemanly, and he
      seems to be very well informed. At a little distance, I think, one would
      take him to be not much over thirty; but nearer at hand one finds him to
      look rather venerable,&mdash;perhaps fifty or more. He is nervous, and his
      hands shook while he was looking over the papers, as if he had been
      startled by my visit; and when we came to the crossings of streets, he
      darted across, cautioning me, as if both were in great danger to be run
      over. Nevertheless, being very quick-tempered, he would face the Devil if
      at all irritated. He gave a most forlorn description of his life; how,
      when he came to Salem, there was nobody except Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      whom he cared about seeing; how his position prevented him from accepting
      of civilities, because he had no home where he could return them; in
      short, he seemed about as miserable a being as is to be found anywhere,&mdash;lonely,
      and with sensitiveness to feel his loneliness, and capacities, now
      withered, to have enjoyed the sweets of life. I suppose he is comfortable
      enough when busied in his duties at the Custom-House; for when I spoke to
      him at my entrance, he was too much absorbed to hear me at first. As we
      walked, he kept telling stories of the family, which seemed to have
      comprised many oddities, eccentric men and women, recluses and other
      kinds,&mdash;one of old Philip English (a Jersey man, the name originally
      L'Anglais), who had been persecuted by John Hawthorne, of witch-time
      memory, and a violent quarrel ensued. When Philip lay on his death-bed, he
      consented to forgive his persecutor; "But if I get well," said he, "I'll
      be damned if I forgive him!" This Philip left daughters, one of whom
      married, I believe, the son of the persecuting John, and thus all the
      legitimate blood of English is in our family. E&mdash;&mdash; passed from
      the matters of birth, pedigree, and ancestral pride to give vent to the
      most arrant democracy and locofocoism that I ever happened to hear, saying
      that nobody ought to possess wealth longer than his own life, and that
      then it should return to the people, etc. He says S. I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      has a great fund of traditions about the family, which she learned from
      her mother or grandmother (I forget which), one of them being a Hawthorne.
      The old lady was a very proud woman, and, as E&mdash;&mdash; says, "proud
      of being proud," and so is S. I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.

    <p>
      October 7th.&mdash;A walk in Northfields in the afternoon. Bright sunshine
      and autumnal warmth, giving a sensation quite unlike the same degree of
      warmth in summer. Oaks,&mdash;some brown, some reddish, some still green;
      walnuts, yellow,&mdash;fallen leaves and acorns lying beneath; the
      footsteps crumple them in walking. In sunny spots beneath the trees, where
      green grass is overstrewn by the dry, fallen foliage, as I passed, I
      disturbed multitudes of grasshoppers basking in the warm sunshine; and
      they began to hop, hop, hop, pattering on the dry leaves like big and
      heavy drops of a thunder-shower. They were invisible till they hopped.
      Boys gathering walnuts. Passed an orchard, where two men were gathering
      the apples. A wagon, with barrels, stood among the trees; the men's coats
      flung on the fence; the apples lay in heaps, and each of the men was up in
      a separate tree. They conversed together in loud voices, which the air
      caused to ring still louder, jeering each other, boasting of their own
      feats in shaking down the apples. One got into the very top of his tree,
      and gave a long and mighty shake, and the big apples came down thump,
      thump, bushels hitting on the ground at once. "There! did you ever hear
      anything like that?" cried he. This sunny scene was pretty. A horse
      feeding apart, belonging to the wagon. The barberry-bushes have some red
      fruit on them, but they are frost-bitten. The rose-bushes have their
      scarlet hips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Distant clumps of trees, now that the variegated foliage adorns them, have
      a phantasmagorian, an apparition-like appearance. They seem to be of some
      kindred to the crimson and gold cloud-islands. It would not be strange to
      see phantoms peeping forth from their recesses. When the sun was almost
      below the horizon, his rays, gilding the upper branches of a yellow
      walnut-tree, had an airy and beautiful effect,&mdash;the gentle contrast
      between the tint of the yellow in the shade and its ethereal gold in the
      fading sunshine. The woods that crown distant uplands were seen to great
      advantage in these last rays, for the sunshine perfectly marked out and
      distinguished every shade of color, varnishing them as it were; while the
      country round, both hill and plain, being in gloomy shadow, the woods
      looked the brighter for it.

      The tide, being high, had flowed almost into the Cold Spring, so its small
      current hardly issued forth from the basin. As I approached, two little
      eels, about as long as my finger, and slender in proportion, wriggled out
      of the basin. They had come from the salt water. An Indian-corn field, as
      yet unharvested,&mdash;huge, golden pumpkins scattered among the hills of
      corn,&mdash;a noble-looking fruit. After the sun was down, the sky was
      deeply dyed with a broad sweep of gold, high towards the zenith; not
      flaming brightly, but of a somewhat dusky gold. A piece of water,
      extending towards the west, between high banks, caught the reflection, and
      appeared like a sheet of brighter and more glistening gold than the sky
      which made it bright.

      How exceeding bright looks the sunshine, casually reflected from a
      looking-glass into a gloomy region of the chamber, distinctly marking out
      the figures and colors of the paper-hangings, which are scarcely seen
      elsewhere. It is like the light of mind thrown on an obscure subject.

      Man's finest workmanship, the closer you observe it, the more
      imperfections it shows; as in a piece of polished steel a microscope will
      discover a rough surface. Whereas, what may look coarse and rough in
      Nature's workmanship will show an infinitely minute perfection, the closer
      you look into it. The reason of the minute superiority of Nature's work
      over man's is, that the former works from the innermost germ, while the
      latter works merely superficially.

      Standing in the cross-road that leads by the Mineral Spring, and looking
      towards an opposite shore of the lake, an ascending bank, with a douse
      border of trees, green, yellow, red, russet, all bright colors, brightened
      by the mild brilliancy of the descending sun; it was strange to recognize
      the sober old friends of spring and summer in this new dress. By the by, a
      pretty riddle or fable might be made out of the changes in apparel of the
      familiar trees round a house, adapted for children. But in the lake,
      beneath the aforesaid border of trees,&mdash;the water being, not rippled,
      but its glassy surface somewhat moved and shaken by the remote agitation
      of a breeze that was breathing on the outer lake,&mdash;this being in a
      sort of bay,&mdash;in the slightly agitated mirror, the variegated trees
      were reflected dreamily and indistinctly; a broad belt of bright and
      diversified colors shining in the water beneath. Sometimes the image of a
      tree might be almost traced; then nothing but this sweep of broken
      rainbow. It was like the recollection of the real scene in an observer's
      mind,&mdash;a confused radiance.

      Salem, October 14th.&mdash;A walk through Beverly to Browne's Hill, and
      home by the iron-factory. A bright, cool afternoon. The trees, in a large
      part of the space through which I passed, appeared to be in their fullest
      glory, bright red, yellow, some of a tender green, appearing at a distance
      as if bedecked with new foliage, though this emerald tint was likewise the
      effect of frost. In some places, large tracts of ground were covered as
      with a scarlet cloth,&mdash;the underbrush being thus colored. The general
      character of these autumnal colors is not gaudy, scarcely gay; there is
      something too deep and rich in it: it is gorgeous and magnificent, but
      with a sobriety diffused. The pastures at the foot of Browne's Hill were
      plentifully covered with barberry-bushes, the leaves of which were
      reddish, and they were hung with a prodigious quantity of berries. From
      the summit of the hill, looking down a tract of woodland at a considerable
      distance, so that the interstices between the trees could not be seen,
      their tops presented an unbroken level, and seemed somewhat like a richly
      variegated carpet. The prospect from the hill is wide and interesting; but
      methinks it is pleasanter in the more immediate vicinity of the hill than
      miles away. It is agreeable to look down at the square patches of
      cornfield, or of potato-ground, or of cabbages still green, or of beets
      looking red,&mdash;all a man's farm, in short,&mdash;each portion of which
      he considers separately so important, while you take in the whole at a
      glance. Then to cast your eye over so many different establishments at
      once, and rapidly compare thorn,&mdash;here a house of gentility, with
      shady old yellow-leaved elms hanging around it; there a new little white
      dwelling; there an old farm-house; to see the barns and sheds and all the
      out-houses clustered together; to comprehend the oneness and exclusiveness
      and what constitutes the peculiarity of each of so many establishments,
      and to have in your mind a multitude of them, each of which is the most
      important part of the world to those who live in it,&mdash;this really
      enlarges the mind, and you come down the hill somewhat wiser than you go
      up. Pleasant to look over an orchard far below, and see the trees, each
      casting its own shadow; the white spires of meeting-houses; a sheet of
      water, partly seen among swelling lands. This Browne's Hill is a long
      ridge, lying in the midst of a large, level plain; it looks at a distance
      somewhat like a whale, with its head and tail under water, but its immense
      back protruding, with steep sides, and a gradual curve along its length.
      When you have climbed it on one side, and gaze from the summit at the
      other, you feel as if you had made a discovery,&mdash;the landscape being
      quite different on the two sides. The cellar of the house which formerly
      crowned the hill, and used to be named Browne's Folly, still remains, two
      grass-grown and shallow hollows, on the highest part of the ridge. The
      house consisted of two wings, each perhaps sixty feet in length, united by
      a middle part, in which was the entrance-hall, and which looked lengthwise
      along the hill. The foundation of a spacious porch may be traced on either
      side of the central portion; some of the stones still remain; but even
      where they are gone, the line of the porch is still traceable by the
      greener verdure. In the cellar, or rather in the two cellars, grow one or
      two barberry-bushes, with frost-bitten fruit; there is also yarrow with
      its white flower, and yellow dandelions. The cellars are still deep enough
      to shelter a person, all but his head at least, from the wind on the
      summit of the hill; but they are all grass-grown. A line of trees seems to
      have been planted along the ridge of the hill. The edifice must have made
      quite a magnificent appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Characteristics during the walk:&mdash;Apple-trees with only here and
      there an apple on the boughs, among the thinned leaves, the relics of a
      gathering. In others you observe a rustling, and see the boughs shaking
      and hear the apples thumping down, without seeing the person who does it.
      Apples scattered by the wayside, some with pieces bitten out, others
      entire, which you pick up and taste, and find them harsh, crabbed
      cider-apples, though they have a pretty, waxen appearance. In sunny spots
      of woodland, boys in search of nuts, looking picturesque among the scarlet
      and golden foliage. There is something in this sunny autumnal atmosphere
      that gives a peculiar effect to laughter and joyous voices,&mdash;it makes
      them infinitely more elastic and gladsome than at other seasons. Heaps of
      dry leaves tossed together by the wind, as if for a couch and
      lounging-place for the weary traveller, while the sun is warming it for
      him. Golden pumpkins and squashes, heaped in the angle of a house, till
      they reach the lower windows. Ox-teams, laden with a rustling load of
      Indian corn, in the stalk and ear. When all inlet of the sea runs far up
      into the country, you stare to see a large schooner appear amid the rural
      landscape; she is unloading a cargo of wood, moist with rain or salt water
      that has dashed over it. Perhaps you hear the sound of an axe in the
      woodland; occasionally, the report of a fowling-piece. The travellers in
      the early part of the afternoon look warm and comfortable as if taking a
      summer drive; but as eve draws nearer, you meet them well wrapped in
      top-coats or cloaks, or rough, great surtouts, and red-nosed withal,
      seeming to take no great comfort, but pressing homeward. The
      characteristic conversation among teamsters and country squires, where the
      ascent of a hill causes the chaise to go at the same pace as an ox-team,&mdash;perhaps
      discussing the qualities of a yoke of oxen. The cold, blue aspects of
      sheets of water. Some of the country shops with the doors closed; others
      still open as in summer. I meet a wood-sawyer, with his horse and saw on
      his shoulders, returning from work. As night draws on, you begin to see
      the gleaming of fires on the ceilings in the houses which you pass. The
      comfortless appearance of houses at bleak and bare spots,&mdash;you wonder
      how there can be any enjoyment in them. I meet a girl in a chintz gown,
      with a small shawl on her shoulders, white stockings, and summer morocco
      shoes,&mdash;it looks observable. Turkeys, queer, solemn objects, in black
      attire, grazing about, and trying to peck the fallen apples, which slip
      away from their bills.
    </p>
    <p>
      October 16th.&mdash;Spent the whole afternoon in a ramble to the
      sea-shore, near Phillips's Beach. A beautiful, warm, sunny afternoon, the
      very pleasantest day, probably, that there has been in the whole course of
      the year. People at work, harvesting, without their coats. Cocks, with
      their squad of hens, in the grass-fields, hunting grasshoppers, chasing
      them eagerly with outspread wings, appearing to take much interest in the
      sport, apart from the profit. Other hens picking up the ears of Indian
      corn. Grasshoppers, flies, and flying insects of all sorts are more
      abundant in these warm autumnal days than I have seen them at any other
      time. Yellow butterflies flutter about in the sunshine, singly, by pairs,
      or more, and are wafted on the gentle gales. The crickets begin to sing
      early in the afternoon, and sometimes a locust may be heard. In some warm
      spots, a pleasant buzz of many insects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crossed the fields near Brookhouse's villa, and came upon a long beach,&mdash;
      at least a mile long, I should think,&mdash;terminated by craggy rocks at
      either end, and backed by a high broken bank, the grassy summit of which,
      year by year, is continually breaking away, and precipitated to the
      bottom. At the foot of the bank, in some parts, is a vast number of
      pebbles and paving-stones, rolled up thither by the sea long ago. The
      beach is of a brown sand, with hardly any pebbles intermixed upon it. When
      the tide is part way down, there is a margin of several yards from the
      water's edge, along the whole mile length of the beach, which glistens
      like a mirror, and reflects objects, and shines bright in the sunshine,
      the sand being wet to that distance from the water. Above this margin the
      sand is not wet, and grows less and less damp the farther towards the bank
      you keep. In some places your footstep is perfectly implanted, showing the
      whole shape, and the square toe, and every nail in the heel of your boot.
      Elsewhere, the impression is imperfect, and even when you stamp, you
      cannot imprint the whole. As you tread, a dry spot flashes around your
      step, and grows moist as you lift your foot again. Pleasant to pass along
      this extensive walk, watching the surf-wave;&mdash;how sometimes it seems
      to make a feint of breaking, but dies away ineffectually, merely kissing
      the strand; then, after many such abortive efforts, it gathers itself, and
      forms a high wall, and rolls onward, heightening and heightening without
      foam at the summit of the green line, and at last throws itself fiercely
      on the beach, with a loud roar, the spray flying above. As you walk along,
      you are preceded by a flock of twenty or thirty beach birds, which are
      seeking, I suppose, for food on the margin of the surf, yet seem to be
      merely sporting, chasing the sea as it retires, and running up before the
      impending wave. Sometimes they let it bear them off their feet, and float
      lightly on its breaking summit; sometimes they flutter and seem to rest on
      the feathery spray. They are little birds with gray backs and snow-white
      breasts; their images may be seen in the wet sand almost or quite as
      distinctly as the reality. Their legs are long. As you draw near, they
      take a flight of a score of yards or more, and then recommence their
      dalliance with the surf-wave. You may behold their multitudinous little
      tracks all along your way. Before you reach the end of the beach, you
      become quite attached to these little sea-birds, and take much interest in
      their occupations. After passing in one direction, it is pleasant then to
      retrace your footsteps. Your tracks being all traceable, you may recall
      the whole mood and occupation of your mind during your first passage. Here
      you turned somewhat aside to pick up a shell that you saw nearer the
      water's edge. Here you examined a long sea-weed, and trailed its length
      after you for a considerable distance. Here the effect of the wide sea
      struck you suddenly. Here you fronted the ocean, looking at a sail,
      distant in the sunny blue. Here you looked at some plant on the bank. Here
      some vagary of mind seems to have bewildered you; for your tracks go round
      and round, and interchange each other without visible reason. Here you
      picked up pebbles and skipped them upon the water. Here you wrote names
      and drew faces with a razor sea-shell in the sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      After leaving the beach, clambered over crags, all shattered and tossed
      about everyhow; in some parts curiously worn and hollowed out, almost into
      caverns. The rock, shagged with sea-weed,&mdash;in some places, a thick
      carpet of sea-weed laid over the pebbles, into which your foot would sink.
      Deep tanks among these rocks, which the sea replenishes at high tide, and
      then leaves the bottom all covered with various sorts of sea-plants, as if
      it were some sea-monster's private garden. I saw a crab in one of them;
      five-fingers too. From the edge of the rocks, you may look off into deep,
      deep water, even at low tide. Among the rocks, I found a great bird,
      whether a wild-goose, a loon, or an albatross, I scarcely know. It was in
      such a position that I almost fancied it might be asleep, and therefore
      drew near softly, lest it should take flight; but it was dead, and stirred
      not when I touched it. Sometimes a dead fish was cast up. A ledge of
      rocks, with a beacon upon it, looking like a monument erected to those who
      have perished by shipwreck. The smoked, extempore fireplace, where a party
      cooked their fish. About midway on the beach, a fresh-water brooklet flows
      towards the sea. Where it leaves the land, it is quite a rippling little
      current; but, in flowing across the sand, it grows shallower and more
      shallow, and at last is quite lost, and dies in the effort to carry its
      little tribute to the main.

      Lieutenant F. W&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; of the navy was an inveterate
      duellist and an unerring shot. He had taken offence at Lieutenant F&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      and endeavored to draw him into a duel, following him to the Mediterranean
      for that purpose, and harassing him intolerably. At last, both parties
      being in Massachusetts, F&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; determined to fight, and
      applied to Lieutenant A&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; to be his second. A&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      examined into the merits of the quarrel, and came to the conclusion that F&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      had not given F. W&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; justifiable cause for driving him
      to a duel, and that he ought not to be shot. He instructed F&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      in the use of the pistol, and, before the meeting, warned him, by all
      means, to get the first fire; for that, if F. W&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; fired
      first, he, F&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, was infallibly a dead man, as his
      antagonist could shoot to a hair's-breadth. The parties met; and F&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      firing immediately on the word's being given, shot F. W&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      through the heart. F. W&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, with a most savage
      expression of countenance, fired, after the bullet had gone through his
      heart, and when the blood had entirely left his face, and shot away one of
      F&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s side-locks. His face probably looked as if he
      were already in the infernal regions; but afterwards it assumed an angelic
      calmness and repose.

      May 11th, 1838.&mdash;At Boston last week. Items:&mdash;A young man, with
      a small mustache, dyed brown, reddish from its original light color. He
      walks with an affected gait, his arms crooked outwards, treading much on
      his toes. His conversation is about the theatre, where he has a season
      ticket,&mdash;about an amateur who lately appeared there, and about
      actresses, with other theatrical scandal.&mdash;In the smoking-room, two
      checker and backgammon boards; the landlord a great player, seemingly a
      stupid man, but with considerable shrewdness and knowledge of the world.&mdash;F&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      the comedian, a stout, heavy-looking Englishman, of grave deportment, with
      no signs of wit or humor, yet aiming at both in conversation, in order to
      support his character. Very steady and regular in his life, and
      parsimonious in his disposition,&mdash;worth $ 50,000, made by his
      profession.&mdash;A clergyman, elderly, with a white neckcloth, very
      unbecoming, an unworldly manner, unacquaintance with the customs of the
      house, and learning them in a childlike way. A ruffle to his shirt,
      crimped.&mdash;A gentleman, young, handsome, and sea-flushed, belonging to
      Oswego, New York, but just arrived in port from the Mediterranean: he
      inquires of me about the troubles in Canada, which were first beginning to
      make a noise when he left the country,&mdash;whether they are all over. I
      tell him all is finished, except the hanging of the prisoners. Then we
      talk over the matter, and I tell him the fates of the principal men,&mdash;
      some banished to New South Wales, one hanged, others in prison, others,
      conspicuous at first, now almost forgotten.&mdash;Apartments of private
      families in the hotel,&mdash;what sort of domesticity there may be in
      them; eating in public, with no board of their own. The gas that lights
      the rest of the house lights them also, in the chandelier from the
      ceiling.&mdash; A shabby-looking man, quiet, with spectacles, at first
      wearing an old, coarse brown frock, then appearing in a suit of elderly
      black, saying nothing unless spoken to, but talking intelligently when
      addressed. He is an editor, and I suppose printer, of a country paper.
      Among the guests, he holds intercourse with gentlemen of much more
      respectable appearance than himself, from the same part of the country.&mdash;Bill
      of fare; wines printed on the back, but nobody calls for a bottle. Chairs
      turned down for expected guests. Three-pronged steel forks. Cold supper
      from nine to eleven P. M. Great, round, mahogany table, in the
      sitting-room, covered with papers. In the morning, before and soon after
      breakfast, gentlemen reading the morning papers, while others wait for
      their chance, or try to pick out something from the papers of yesterday or
      longer ago. In the forenoon, the Southern papers are brought in, and
      thrown damp and folded on the table. The eagerness with which those who
      happen to be in the room start up and make prize of them. Play-bills,
      printed on yellow paper, laid upon the table. Towards evening comes the
      Transcript.

      June 15th.&mdash;The red light which the sunset at this season diffuse;
      there being showery afternoons, but the sun setting bright amid clouds,
      and diffusing its radiance over those that are scattered in masses all
      over the sky. It gives a rich tinge to all objects, even to those of
      sombre lines, yet without changing the lines. The complexions of people
      are exceedingly enriched by it; they look warm, and kindled with a mild
      fire. The whole scenery and personages acquire, methinks, a passionate
      character. A love-scene should be laid on such an evening. The trees and
      the grass have now the brightest possible green, there having been so many
      showers alternating with such powerful sunshine. There are roses and
      tulips and honeysuckles, with their sweet perfume; in short, the splendor
      of a more gorgeous climate than ours might be brought into the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation of a man in the midst of a crowd, yet as completely in the
      power of another, life and all, as if they two were in the deepest
      solitude.

      Tremont, Boston, June 16th.&mdash;Tremendously hot weather to-day. Went on
      board the Cyane to see Bridge, the purser. Took boat from the end of Long
      Wharf; with two boatmen who had just landed a man. Row round to the
      starboard side of the sloop, where we pass up the steps, and are received
      by Bridge, who introduces us to one of the lieutenants,&mdash;Hazard.
      Sailors and midshipmen scattered about,&mdash;the middies having a foul
      anchor, that is, an anchor with a cable twisted round it, embroidered on
      the collars of their jackets. The officers generally wear blue jackets
      with lace on the shoulders, white pantaloons, and cloth caps. Introduced
      into the cabin,&mdash;a handsome room, finished with mahogany,
      comprehending the width of the vessel; a sideboard with liquors, and above
      it a looking-glass; behind the cabin, an inner room, in which is seated a
      lady, waiting for the captain to come on board; on each side of this inner
      cabin, a large and convenient state-room with bed,&mdash;the doors opening
      into the cabin. This cabin is on a level with the quarter-deck, and is
      covered by the poop-deck. Going down below stairs, you come to the
      ward-room, a pretty large room, round which are the state-rooms of the
      lieutenants, the purser, surgeon, etc. A stationary table. The ship's
      main-mast comes down through the middle of the room, and Bridge's chair,
      at dinner, is planted against it. Wine and brandy produced; and Bridge
      calls to the Doctor to drink with him, who answers affirmatively from his
      state-room, and shortly after opens the door and makes his appearance.
      Other officers emerge from the side of the vessel, or disappear into it,
      in the same way. Forward of the ward-room, adjoining it, and on the same
      level, is the midshipmen's room, on the larboard side of the vessel, not
      partitioned off, so as to be shut up. On a shelf a few books; one
      midshipman politely invites us to walk in; another sits writing. Going
      farther forward, on the same level we come to the crew's department, part
      of which is occupied by the cooking-establishment, where all sorts of
      cooking is going on for the officers and men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the whole of this space, ward-room and all, there is barely room
      to stand upright, without the hat on. The rules of the quarter-deck (which
      extends aft from the main-mast) are, that the midshipmen shall not presume
      to walk on the starboard side of it, nor the men to come upon it at all,
      unless to speak to an officer. The poop-deck is still more sacred,&mdash;the
      lieutenants being confined to the larboard side, and the captain alone
      having a right to the starboard. A marine was pacing the poop-deck, being
      the only guard that I saw stationed in the vessel,&mdash;the more
      stringent regulations being relaxed while she is preparing for sea. While
      standing on the quarter-deck, a great piping at the gangway, and the
      second cutter comes alongside, bringing the consul and some other
      gentleman to visit the vessel. After a while, we are rowed ashore with
      them, in the same boat. Its crew are new hands, and therefore require much
      instruction from the cockswain. We are seated under an awning. The guns of
      the Cyane are medium thirty-two pounders; some of them have percussion
      locks.
    </p>

      At the Tremont, I had Bridge to dine with me: iced champagne, claret in
      glass pitchers. Nothing very remarkable among the guests. A wine-merchant,
      French apparently, though he had arrived the day before in a bark from
      Copenhagen: a somewhat corpulent gentleman, without so good manners as an
      American would have in the same line of life, but good-natured, sociable,
      and civil, complaining of the heat. He had rings on his fingers of great
      weight of metal, and one of them had a seal for letters; brooches at the
      bosom, three in a row, up and down; also a gold watch-guard, with a seal
      appended. Talks of the comparative price of living, of clothes, etc., here
      and in Europe. Tells of the prices of wines by the cask and pipe.
      Champagne, he says, is drunk of better quality here than where it grows.&mdash;A
      vendor of patent medicines, Doctor Jaques, makes acquaintance with me, and
      shows me his recommendatory letters in favor of himself and drugs, signed
      by a long list of people. He prefers, he says, booksellers to druggists as
      his agents, and inquired of me about them in this town. He seems to be an
      honest man enough, with an intelligent face, and sensible in his talk, but
      not a gentleman, wearing a somewhat shabby brown coat and mixed
      pantaloons, being ill-shaven, and apparently not well acquainted with the
      customs of a fashionable hotel. A simplicity about him that is likable,
      though, I believe, he comes from Philadelphia.&mdash;Naval officers,
      strolling about town, bargaining for swords and belts, and other military
      articles; with the tailor, to have naval buttons put on their shore-going
      coats, and for their pantaloons, suited to the climate of the
      Mediterranean. It is the almost invariable habit of officers, when going
      ashore or staying on shore, to divest themselves of all military or naval
      insignia, and appear as private citizens. At the Tremont, young gentlemen
      with long earlocks,&mdash;straw hats, light, or dark-mixed.&mdash;The
      theatre being closed, the play-bills of many nights ago are posted up
      against its walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      July 4th.&mdash;A very hot, bright, sunny day; town much thronged; booths
      on the Common, selling gingerbread, sugar-plums, and confectionery, spruce
      beer, lemonade. Spirits forbidden, but probably sold stealthily. On the
      top of one of the booths a monkey, with a tail two or three feet long. He
      is fastened by a cord, which, getting tangled with the flag over the
      booth, he takes hold and tries to free it. He is the object of much
      attention from the crowd, and played with by the boys, who toss up
      gingerbread to him, while he nibbles and throws it down again. He
      reciprocates notice, of some kind or other, with all who notice him. There
      is a sort of gravity about him. A boy pulls his long tail, whereat he
      gives a slight squeak, and for the future elevates it as much as possible.
      Looking at the same booth by and by, I find that the poor monkey has been
      obliged to betake himself to the top of one of the wooden joists that
      stick up high above. There are boys, going about with molasses candy,
      almost melted down in the sun. Shows: A mammoth rat; a collection of
      pirates, murderers, and the like, in wax. Constables in considerable
      number, parading about with their staves, sometimes conversing with each
      other, producing an effect by their presence, without having to interfere
      actively. One or two old salts, rather the worse for liquor: in general
      the people are very temperate. At evening the effect of things rather more
      picturesque; some of the booth-keepers knocking down the temporary
      structures, and putting the materials in wagons to carry away; other
      booths lighted up, and the lights gleaming through rents in the sail-cloth
      tops. The customers are rather riotous, calling loudly and whimsically for
      what they want; a young fellow and a girl coming arm in arm; two girls
      approaching the booth, and getting into conversation with the folks
      thereabout. Perchance a knock-down between two half-sober fellows in the
      crowd: a knock-down without a heavy blow, the receiver being scarcely able
      to keep his footing at any rate. Shoutings and hallooings, laughter,
      oaths,&mdash;generally a good-natured tumult; and the constables use no
      severity, but interfere, if at all, in a friendly sort of way. I talk with
      one about the way in which the day has passed, and he bears testimony to
      the orderliness of the crowd, but suspects one booth of selling liquor,
      and relates one scuffle. There is a talkative and witty seller of
      gingerbread holding forth to the people from his cart, making himself
      quite a noted character by his readiness of remark and humor, and
      disposing of all his wares. Late in the evening, during the fire-works,
      people are consulting how they are to get hone,&mdash; many having long
      miles to walk: a father, with wife and children, saying it will be twelve
      o'clock before they reach home, the children being already tired to death.
      The moon beautifully dark-bright, not giving so white a light as
      sometimes. The girls all look beautiful and fairy-like in it, not exactly
      distinct, nor yet dim. The different characters of female countenances
      during the day,&mdash;mirthful and mischievous, slyly humorous, stupid,
      looking genteel generally, but when they speak often betraying plebeianism
      by the tones of their voices. Two girls are very tired, one a pale, thin,
      languid-looking creature; the other plump, rosy, rather overburdened with
      her own little body. Gingerbread figures, in the shape of Jim Crow and
      other popularities.

      In the old burial-ground, Charter Street, a slate gravestone, carved round
      the borders, to the memory of "Colonel John Hathorne, Esq.," who died in
      1717. This was the witch-judge. The stone is sunk deep into the earth, and
      leans forward, and the grass grows very long around it; and, on account of
      the moss, it was rather difficult to make out the date. Other Hathornes
      lie buried in a range with him on either side. In a corner of the
      burial-ground, close under Dr. P&mdash;&mdash;-'s garden fence, are the
      most ancient stones remaining in the graveyard; moss-grown, deeply sunken.
      One to "Dr. John Swinnerton, Physician," in 1688; another to his wife.
      There, too, is the grave of Nathaniel Mather, the younger brother of
      Cotton, and mentioned in the Magnalia as a hard student, and of great
      promise. "An aged man at nineteen years," saith the gravestone. It
      affected me deeply, when I had cleared away the grass from the half-buried
      stone, and read the name. An apple-tree or two hang over these old graves,
      and throw down the blighted fruit on Nathaniel Mather's grave,&mdash;he
      blighted too. It gives strange ideas, to think how convenient to Dr. P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s
      family this burial-ground is,&mdash;the monuments standing almost within
      arm's reach of the side windows of the parlor,&mdash;and there being a
      little gate from the back yard through which we step forth upon those old
      graves aforesaid. And the tomb of the P. family is right in front, and
      close to the gate. It is now filled, the last being the refugee Tory,
      Colonel P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; and his wife. M. P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; has
      trained flowers over this tomb, on account of her friendly relations with
      Colonel P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not, I think, the most ancient families that have tombs,&mdash;their
      ancestry for two or three generations having been reposited in the earth
      before such a luxury as a tomb was thought of. Men who founded families,
      and grew rich, a century or so ago, were probably the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a tomb of the Lyndes, with a slab of slate affixed to the brick
      masonry on one side, and carved with a coat of arms.

      July 10th.&mdash;A fishing excursion, last Saturday afternoon, eight or
      ten miles out in the harbor. A fine wind out, which died away towards
      evening, and finally became quite calm. We cooked our fish on a rock named
      "Satan," about forty feet long and twenty broad, irregular in its shape,
      and of uneven surface, with pools of water here and there, left by the
      tide,&mdash;dark brown rock, or whitish; there was the excrement of
      sea-fowl scattered on it, and a few feathers. The water was deep around
      the rock, and swelling up and downward, waving the sea-weed. We built two
      fires, which, as the dusk deepened, cast a red gleam over the rock and the
      waves, and made the sea, on the side away from the sunset, look dismal;
      but by and by up came the moon, red as a house afire, and, as it rose, it
      grew silvery bright, and threw a line of silver across the calm sea.
      Beneath the moon and the horizon, the commencement of its track of
      brightness, there was a cone of blackness, or of very black blue. It was
      after nine before we finished our supper, which we ate by firelight and
      moonshine, and then went aboard our decked boat again,&mdash;no safe
      achievement in our ticklish little dory. To those remaining in the boat,
      we had looked very picturesque around our fires, and on the rock above
      them,&mdash;our statures being apparently increased to the size of the
      sons of Anak. The tide, now coming up, gradually dashed over the fires we
      had left, and so the rock again became a desert. The wind had now entirely
      died away, leaving the sea smooth as glass, except a quiet swell, and we
      could only float along, as the tide bore us, almost imperceptibly. It was
      as beautiful a night as ever shone,&mdash;calm, warm, bright, the moon
      being at full. On one side of us was Marblehead lighthouse, on the other,
      Baker's Island; and both, by the influence of the moonlight, had a silvery
      hue, unlike their ruddy beacon tinge in dark nights. They threw long
      reflections across the sea, like the moon. There we floated slowly with
      the tide till about midnight, and then, the tide turning, we fastened our
      vessel to a pole, which marked a rock, so as to prevent being carried back
      by the reflux. Some of the passengers turned in below; some stretched
      themselves on deck; some walked about, smoking cigars. I kept the deck all
      night. Once there was a little cat's-paw of a breeze, whereupon we untied
      ourselves from the pole; but it almost immediately died away, and we were
      compelled to make fast again. At about two o'clock, up rose the morning
      star, a round, red, fiery ball, very comparable to the moon at its rising,
      and, getting upward, it shone marvellously bright, and threw its long
      reflection into the sea, like the moon and the two lighthouses. It was
      Venus, and the brightest star I ever beheld; it was in the northeast. The
      moon made but a very small circuit in the sky, though it shone all night.
      The aurora borealis shot upwards to the zenith, and between two and three
      o'clock the first streak of dawn appeared, stretching far along the edge
      of the eastern horizon,&mdash; a faint streak of light; then it gradually
      broadened and deepened, and became a rich saffron tint, with violet above,
      and then an ethereal and transparent blue. The saffron became intermixed
      with splendor, kindling and kindling, Baker's Island lights being in the
      centre of the brightness, so that they were extinguished by it, or at
      least grew invisible. On the other side of the boat, the Marblehead
      lighthouse still threw out its silvery gleam, and the moon shone brightly
      too; and its light looked very singularly, mingling with the growing
      daylight. It was not like the moonshine, brightening as the evening
      twilight deepens; for now it threw its radiance over the landscape, the
      green and other tints of which were displayed by the daylight, whereas
      at-evening all those tints are obscured. It looked like a milder sunshine,&mdash;a
      dreamy sunshine,&mdash;the sunshine of a world not quite so real and
      material as this. All night we had heard the Marblehead clocks telling the
      hour. Anon, up came the sun, without any bustle, but quietly, his
      antecedent splendors having gilded the sea for some time before. It had
      been cold towards morning, but now grew warm, and gradually burning hot in
      the sun. A breeze sprang up, but our first use of it was to get aground on
      Coney Island about five o'clock, where we lay till nine or thereabout, and
      then floated slowly up to the wharf. The roar of distant surf, the rolling
      of porpoises, the passing of shoals of fish, a steamboat smoking along at
      a distance, were the scene on my watch. I fished during the night, and,
      feeling something on the line, I drew up with great eagerness and vigor.
      It was two of those broad-leaved sea-weeds, with stems like snakes, both
      rooted on a stone,&mdash;all which came up together. Often these sea-weeds
      root themselves on muscles. In the morning, our pilot killed a flounder
      with the boat-hook, the poor fish thinking himself secure on the bottom.

      Ladurlad, in the Curse of Kehama, on visiting a certain celestial region,

      months' seclusion from old associations.

      July 13th.&mdash;A show of wax-figures, consisting almost wholly of
      murderers and their victims,&mdash;Gibbs and Hansley, the pirates, and the
      Dutch girl whom Gibbs murdered. Gibbs and Hansley were admirably done, as
      natural as life; and many people who had known Gibbs would not, according
      to the showman, be convinced that this wax-figure was not his skin
      stuffed. The two pirates were represented with halters round their necks,
      just ready to be turned off; and the sheriff stood behind them, with his
      watch, waiting for the moment. The clothes, halter, and Gibbs's hair were
      authentic. E. K. Avery and Cornell,&mdash;the former a figure in black,
      leaning on the back of a chair, in the attitude of a clergyman about to
      pray; an ugly devil, said to be a good likeness. Ellen Jewett and R. P.
      Robinson, she dressed richly, in extreme fashion, and very pretty; he
      awkward and stiff, it being difficult to stuff a figure to look like a
      gentleman. The showman seemed very proud of Ellen Jewett, and spoke of her
      somewhat as if this wax-figure were a real creation. Strong and Mrs.
      Whipple, who together murdered the husband of the latter. Lastly the
      Siamese twins. The showman is careful to call his exhibition the
      "Statuary." He walks to and fro before the figures, talking of the history
      of the persons, the moral lessons to be drawn therefrom, and especially of
      the excellence of the wax-work. He has for sale printed histories of the
      personages. He is a friendly, easy-mannered sort of a half-genteel
      character, whose talk has been moulded by the persons who most frequent
      such a show; an air of superiority of information, a moral instructor,
      with a great deal of real knowledge of the world. He invites his departing
      guests to call again and bring their friends, desiring to know whether
      they are pleased; telling that he had a thousand people on the 4th of
      July, and that they were all perfectly satisfied. He talks with the female
      visitors, remarking on Ellen Jewett's person and dress to them, he having
      "spared no expense in dressing her; and all the ladies say that a dress
      never set better, and he thinks he never knew a handsomer female." He goes
      to and fro, snuffing the candles, and now and then holding one to the face
      of a favorite figure. Ever and anon, hearing steps upon the staircase, he
      goes to admit a new visitor. The visitors,&mdash;a half-bumpkin, half
      country-squire-like man, who has something of a knowing air, and yet looks
      and listens with a good deal of simplicity and faith, smiling between
      whiles; a mechanic of the town; several decent-looking girls and women,
      who eye Ellen herself with more interest than the other figures,&mdash;women
      having much curiosity about such ladies; a gentlemanly sort of person, who
      looks somewhat ashamed of himself for being there, and glances at me
      knowingly, as if to intimate that he was conscious of being out of place;
      a boy or two, and myself, who examine wax faces and faces of flesh with
      equal interest. A political or other satire might be made by describing a
      show of wax-figures of the prominent public men; and, by the remarks of
      the showman and the spectators, their characters and public standing might
      be expressed. And the incident of Judge Tyler as related by E&mdash;&mdash;
      might be introduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      A series of strange, mysterious, dreadful events to occur, wholly
      destructive of a person's happiness. He to impute them to various persons
      and causes, but ultimately finds that he is himself the sole agent. Moral,
      that our welfare depends on ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strange incident in the court of Charles IX. of France: he and five
      other maskers being attired in coats of linen covered with pitch and
      bestuck with flax to represent hairy savages. They entered the hall
      dancing, the five being fastened together, and the king in front. By
      accident the five were set on fire with a torch. Two were burned to death
      on the spot, two afterwards died; one fled to the buttery, and jumped into
      a vessel of water. It might be represented as the fate of a squad of
      dissolute men.

      A perception, for a moment, of one's eventual and moral self, as if it

      looking intently at the qualities of the character. There is a surprise
      when this happens,&mdash;this getting out of one's self,&mdash;and then
      the observer sees how queer a fellow he is.

      July 27th.&mdash;Left home [Salem] on the 23d instant. To Boston by stage,
      and took the afternoon cars for Worcester. A little boy returning from the
      city, several miles, with a basket of empty custard-cups, the contents of
      which he had probably sold at the depot. Stopped at the Temperance House.
      An old gentleman, Mr. Phillips of Boston, got into conversation with one,
      and inquired very freely as to my character, tastes, habits, and
      circumstances,&mdash;a freedom sanctioned by his age, his kindly and
      beneficent spirit, and the wisdom of his advice. It is strange how little
      impertinence depends on what is actually said, but rather on the manner
      and motives of saying it. "I want to do you good," said he with warmth,
      after becoming, apparently, moved by my communications. "Well, sir,"
      replied I, "I wish you could, for both our sakes; for I have no doubt it
      will be a great satisfaction to you." He asked the most direct questions
      of another young man; for instance, "Are you married?" having before
      ascertained that point with regard to myself. He told me by all means to
      act, in whatever way; observing that he himself would have no objection to
      be a servant, if no other mode of action presented itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord of the tavern, a decent, active, grave, attentive personage,
      giving me several cards of his house to distribute on my departure. A
      judge, a stout, hearty country squire, looking elderly; a hale and rugged
      man, in a black coat, and thin, light pantaloons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Started for Northampton at half past nine in the morning. A respectable
      sort of man and his son on their way to Niagara,&mdash;grocers, I believe,
      and calculating how to perform the tour, subtracting as few days as
      possible from the shop. Somewhat inexperienced travellers, and comparing
      everything advantageously or otherwise with Boston customs; and
      considering themselves a long way from home, while yet short of a hundred
      miles from it. Two ladies, rather good-looking. I rode outside nearly all
      day, and was very sociable with the driver and another outside passenger.
      Towards night, took up an essence-vendor for a short distance. He was
      returning home, after having been out on a tour two or three weeks; and
      nearly exhausted his stock. He was not exclusively an essence-pedler,
      having a large tin box, which had been filled with dry goods, combs,
      jewelry, etc., now mostly sold out. His essences were of anise-seed,
      cloves, red-cedar, wormwood, together with opodeldoc, and an oil for the
      hair. These matters are concocted at Ashfield, and the pedlers are sent
      about with vast quantities. Cologne-water is among the essences
      manufactured, though the bottles have foreign labels on them. The pedler
      was good-natured and communicative, and spoke very frankly about his
      trade, which he seemed to like better than farming, though his experience
      of it is yet brief. He spoke of the trials of temper to which pedlers are
      subjected, but said that it was necessary to be forbearing, because the
      same road must be travelled again and again. The pedlers find satisfaction
      for all contumelies in making good bargains out of their customers. This
      man was a pedler in quite a small way, making but a narrow circuit, and
      carrying no more than an open basket full of essences; but some go out
      with wagon-loads. He himself contemplated a trip westward, in which case
      he would send on quantities of his wares ahead to different stations. He
      seemed to enjoy the intercourse and seeing of the world. He pointed out a
      rough place in the road, where his stock of essences had formerly been
      broken by a jolt of the stage. What a waste of sweet smells on the desert
      air! The essence-labels stated the efficacy of the stuffs for various
      complaints of children and grown people. The driver was an acquaintance of
      the pedler, and so gave him his drive for nothing, though the pedler
      pretended to wish to force some silver into his hand; and afterwards he
      got down to water the horses, while the driver was busied with other
      matters. This driver was a little, dark ragamuffin, apparently of
      irascible temper, speaking with great disapprobation of his way-bill not
      being timed accurately, but so as to make it appear as if he were longer
      upon the road than he was. As he spoke, the blood darkened in his cheek,
      and his eye looked ominous and angry, as if he were enraged with the
      person to whom he was speaking; yet he had not real grit, for he had never
      said a word of his grievances to those concerned. "I mean to tell them of
      it by and by. I won't bear it more than three or four times more," said
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left Northampton the next morning, between one and two o'clock. Three
      other passengers, whose faces were not visible for some hours; so we went
      on through unknown space, saying nothing, glancing forth sometimes to see
      the gleam of the lanterns on wayside objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      How very desolate looks a forest when seen in this way,&mdash;as if,
      should you venture one step within its wild, tangled, many-stemmed, and
      dark-shadowed verge, you would inevitably be lost forever. Sometimes we
      passed a house, or rumbled through a village, stopping perhaps to arouse
      some drowsy postmaster, who appeared at the door in shirt and pantaloons,
      yawning, received the mail, returned it again, and was yawning when last
      seen. A few words exchanged among the passengers, as they roused
      themselves from their half-slumbers, or dreamy, slumber-like abstraction.
      Meantime dawn broke, our faces became partially visible, the morning air
      grew colder, and finally cloudy day came on. We found ourselves driving
      through quite a romantic country, with hills or mountains on all sides, a
      stream on one side, bordered by a high, precipitous bank, up which would
      have grown pines, only that, losing their footholds, many of them had
      slipped downward. The road was not the safest in the world; for often the
      carriage approached within two or three feet of a precipice; but the
      driver, a merry fellow, lolled on his box, with his feet protruding
      horizontally, and rattled on at the rate of ten miles an hour. Breakfast
      between four and five,&mdash;newly caught trout, salmon, ham, boiled eggs,
      and other niceties,&mdash;truly excellent. A bunch of pickerel, intended
      for a tavern-keeper farther on, was carried by the stage-driver. The
      drivers carry a "time-watch" enclosed in a small wooden case, with a lock,
      so that it may be known in what time they perform their stages. They are
      allowed so many hours and minutes to do their work, and their desire to go
      as fast as possible, combined with that of keeping their horses in good
      order, produces about a right medium.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the passengers was a young man who had been in Pennsylvania,
      keeping a school,&mdash;a genteel enough young man, but not a gentleman.
      He took neither supper nor breakfast, excusing himself from one as being
      weary with riding all day, and from the other because it was so early. He
      attacked me for a subscription for "building up a destitute church," of
      which he had taken an agency, and had collected two or three hundred
      dollars, but wanted as many thousands. Betimes in the morning, on the
      descent of a mountain, we arrived at a house where dwelt the married
      sister of the young man, whom he was going to visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      He alighted, saw his trunk taken off, and then, having perceived his
      sister at the door, and turning to bid us farewell, there was a broad
      smile, even a laugh of pleasure, which did him more credit with me than
      anything else; for hitherto there had been a disagreeable scornful twist
      upon his face, perhaps, however, merely superficial. I saw, as the stage
      drove off, his comely sister approaching with a lighted-up face to greet
      him, and one passenger on the front seat beheld them meet. "Is it an
      affectionate greeting?" inquired I. "Yes," said he, "I should like to
      share it"; whereby I concluded that there was a kiss exchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The highest point of our journey was at Windsor, where we could see
      leagues around over the mountain, a terribly bare, bleak spot, fit for
      nothing but sheep, and without shelter of woods. We rattled downward into
      a warmer region, beholding as we went the sun shining on portions of the
      landscape, miles ahead of us, while we were yet in chillness and gloom. It
      is probable that during a part of the stage the mists around us looked
      like sky clouds to those in the lower regions. Think of driving a
      stage-coach through the clouds! Seasonably in the forenoon we arrived at
      Pittsfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pittsfield is a large village, quite shut in by mountain walls, generally
      extending like a rampart on all sides of it, but with insulated great
      hills rising here and there in the outline. The area of the town is level;
      its houses are handsome, mostly wooden and white; but some are of brick,
      painted deep red, the bricks being not of a healthy, natural color. There
      are handsome churches, Gothic and others, and a court-house and an
      academy; the court-house having a marble front. There is a small wall in
      the centre of the town, and in the centre of the Mall rises an elm of the
      loftiest and straightest stem that ever I beheld, without a branch or leaf
      upon it till it has soared seventy or perhaps a hundred feet into the air.
      The top branches unfortunately have been shattered somehow or other, so
      that it does not cast a broad shade; probably they were broken by their
      own ponderous foliage. The central square of Pittsfield presents all the
      bustle of a thriving village,&mdash;the farmers of the vicinity in light
      wagons, sulkies, or on horseback; stages at the door of the Berkshire
      Hotel, under the stoop of which sit or lounge the guests, stage-people,
      and idlers, observing or assisting in the arrivals and departures. Huge
      trunks and bandboxes unladed and laded. The courtesy shown to ladies in
      aiding them to alight, in a shower, under umbrellas. The dull looks of
      passengers, who have driven all night, scarcely brightened by the
      excitement of arriving at a new place. The stage agent demanding the names
      of those who are going on,&mdash;some to Lebanon Springs, some to Albany.
      The toddy-stick is still busy at these Berkshire public-houses. At dinner
      soup preliminary, in city style. Guests: the court people; Briggs, member
      of Congress, attending a trial here; horse-dealers, country squires,
      store-keepers in the village, etc. My room, a narrow crib overlooking a
      back court-yard, where a young man and a lad were drawing water for the
      maid-servants,&mdash;their jokes, especially those of the lad, of whose
      wit the elder fellow, being a blockhead himself, was in great admiration,
      and declared to another that he knew as much as them both. Yet he was not
      very witty. Once in a while the maid-servants would come to the door, and
      hear and respond to their jokes, with a kind of restraint, yet both
      permitting and enjoying them.
    </p>
    <p>
      After or about sunset there was a heavy shower, the thunder rumbling round
      and round the mountain wall, and the clouds stretching from rampart to
      rampart. When it abated, the clouds in all parts of the visible heavens
      were tinged with glory from the west; some that hung low being purple and
      gold, while the higher ones were gray. The slender curve of the new moon
      was also visible brightening amidst the fading brightness of the sunny
      part of the sky. There are marble-quarries in and near Pittsfield, which
      accounts for the fact that there are none but marble gravestones in the
      burial-grounds; some of the monuments well carved; but the marble does not
      withstand the wear and tear of time and weather so well as the imported
      marble, and the sculpture soon loses its sharp outline. The door of one
      tomb, a wooden door, opening in the side of a green mound, surmounted by a
      marble obelisk, having been shaken from its hinges by the late explosion
      of the powder-house, and incompletely repaired, I peeped in at the
      crevices, and saw the coffins. It was the tomb of Rev. Thomas Allen, first
      minister of Pittsfield, deceased in 1810. It contained three coffins, all
      with white mould on their tops: one, a small child's, rested upon another,
      and the other was on the opposite side of the tomb, and the lid was
      considerably displaced; but, the tomb being dark, I could see neither
      corpse nor skeleton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marble also occurs here in North Adams, and thus some very ordinary houses
      have marble doorsteps, and even the stone walls are built of fragments of
      marble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wednesday, 26th.&mdash;Left Pittsfield at about eight o'clock in the
      Bennington stage, intending to go to Williamstown. Inside passengers,&mdash;a
      new-married couple taking a jaunt. The lady, with a clear, pale
      complexion, and a rather pensive cast of countenance, slender, and with a
      genteel figure; the bridegroom, a shopkeeper in New York probably, a young
      man with a stout black beard, black eyebrows, which formed one line across
      his forehead. They were very loving; and while the stage stopped, I
      watched them, quite entranced in each other, both leaning sideways against
      the back of the coach, and perusing their mutual comeliness, and
      apparently making complimentary observations upon it to one another. The
      bride appeared the most absorbed and devoted, referring her whole being to
      him. The gentleman seemed in a most paradisiacal mood, smiling ineffably
      upon his bride, and, when she spoke, responding to her with a benign
      expression of matrimonial sweetness, and, as it were, compassion for the
      "weaker vessel," mingled with great love and pleasant humor. It was very
      droll. The driver peeped into the coach once, and said that he had his arm
      round her waist. He took little freedoms with her, tapping her with his
      cane,&mdash;love-pats; and she seemed to see nothing amiss. They kept
      eating gingerbread all along the road, and dined heartily notwithstanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our driver was a slender, lathe-like, round-backed, rough-bearded,
      thin-visaged, middle-aged Yankee, who became very communicative during our
      drive. He was not bred a stage-driver, but had undertaken the business
      temporarily, as a favor to his brother-in-law. He was a native of these
      Berkshire mountains, but had formerly emigrated to Ohio, and had returned
      for a time to try the benefit of her native air on his wife's declining
      health,&mdash;she having complaints of a consumptive nature. He pointed
      out the house where he was married to her, and told the name of the
      country squire who tied the knot. His wife has little or no chance of
      recovery, and he said he would never marry again,&mdash;this resolution
      being expressed in answer to a remark of mine relative to a second
      marriage. He has no children. I pointed to a hill at some distance before
      us, and asked what it was. "That, sir," said he, "is a very high hill. It
      is known by the name of Graylock." He seemed to feel that this was a more
      poetical epithet than Saddleback, which is a more usual name for it.
      Graylock, or Saddleback, is quite a respectable mountain; and I suppose
      the former name has been given to it because it often has a gray cloud, or
      lock of gray mist, upon its head. It does not ascend into a peak, but
      heaves up a round ball, and has supporting ridges on each side. Its summit
      is not bare, like that of Mount Washington, but covered with forests. The
      driver said, that several years since the students of Williams College
      erected a building for an observatory on the top of the mountain, and
      employed him to haul the materials for constructing it; and he was the
      only man who had driven an ox-team up Graylock. It was necessary to drive
      the team round and round, in ascending. President Griffin rode up on
      horseback.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along our road we passed villages, and often factories, the machinery
      whirring, and girls looking out of the windows at the stage, with heads
      averted from their tasks, but still busy. These factories have two, three,
      or more boarding-houses near them, two stories high, and of double length,&mdash;often
      with bean-vines running up round the doors, and with altogether a domestic
      look. There are several factories in different parts of North Adams, along
      the banks of a stream,&mdash;a wild, highland rivulet, which, however,
      does vast work of a civilized nature. It is strange to see such a rough
      and untamed stream as it looks to be so subdued to the purposes of man,
      and making cottons and woollens, sawing boards and marbles, and giving
      employment to so many men and girls. And there is a sort of
      picturesqueness in finding these factories, supremely artificial
      establishments, in the midst of such wild scenery. For now the stream will
      be flowing through a rude forest, with the trees erect and dark, as when
      the Indians fished there; and it brawls and tumbles and eddies over its
      rock-strewn current. Perhaps there is a precipice, hundreds of feet high,
      beside it, down which, by heavy rains or the melting of snows, great
      pine-trees have slid or fallen headlong, and lie at the bottom, or
      half-way down, while their brethren seem to be gazing at their fall from
      the summit, and anticipating a like fate. And then, taking a turn in the
      road, behold these factories and their range of boarding-houses, with the
      girls looking out of the windows as aforesaid! And perhaps the wild
      scenery is all around the very site of the factory, and mingles its
      impression strangely with those opposite ones. These observations were
      made during a walk yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bathed in a pool of the stream that was out of sight, and where its
      brawling waters were deep enough to cover me, when I lay at length. A part
      of the road along which I walked was on the edge of a precipice, falling
      down straight towards the stream; and in one place the passage of heavy
      loads had sunk it, so that soon, probably, there will be an avalanche,
      perhaps carrying a stage-coach or heavy wagon down into the bed of the
      river.
    </p>
    <p>
      I met occasional wayfarers; once two women in a cart,&mdash;decent,
      brown-visaged, country matrons,&mdash;and then an apparent doctor, of whom
      there are seven or thereabouts in North Adams; for though this vicinity is
      very healthy, yet the physicians are obliged to ride considerable
      distances among the mountain towns, and their practice is very laborious.
      A nod is always exchanged between strangers meeting on the road. This
      morning an underwitted old man met me on a walk, and held a pretty long
      conversation, insisting upon shaking hands (to which I was averse, lest
      his band should not be clean), and insisting on his right to do so, as
      being "a friend of mankind." He was a gray, bald-headed, wrinkled-visaged
      figure, decently dressed, with cowhide shoes, a coat on one arm, and an
      umbrella on the other, and said that he was going to see a widow in the
      neighborhood. Finding that I was not provided with a wife, he recommended
      a certain maiden of forty years, who had three hundred acres of land. He
      spoke of his children, who are proprietors of a circus establishment, and
      have taken a granddaughter to bring up in their way of life; and he gave
      me a message to tell them in case we should meet. While this old man is
      wandering among the hills, his children are the gaze of multitudes. He
      told me the place where he was born, directing me to it by pointing to a
      wreath of mist which lay on the side of a mountain ridge, which he termed
      "the smoke yonder." Speaking of the widow, he said: "My wife has been dead
      these seven years, and why should not I enjoy myself a little?" His manner
      was full of quirks and quips and eccentricities, waving his umbrella and
      gesticulating strangely, with a great deal of action. I suppose, to help
      his natural foolishness, he had been drinking. We parted, he exhorting me
      not to forget his message to his sons, and I shouting after him a request
      to be remembered to the widow. Conceive something tragical to be talked
      about, and much might be made of this interview in a wild road among the
      hills, with Graylock, at a great distance, looking sombre and angry, by
      reason of the gray, heavy mist upon his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning was cloudy, and all the near landscape lay unsunned; but there
      was sunshine on distant tracts, in the valleys, and in specks upon the
      mountain-tops. Between the ridges of hills, there are long, wide, deep
      valleys, extending for miles and miles, with houses scattered along them.
      A bulky company of mountains, swelling round head over round head, rises
      insulated by such broad vales from the surrounding ridges.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ought to have mentioned that I arrived at North Adams in the forenoon of
      the 26th, and, liking the aspect of matters indifferently well, determined
      to make my headquarters here for a short time.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the road to Northampton, we passed a tame crow, which was sitting on
      the peak of a barn. The crow flew down from its perch, and followed us a
      great distance, hopping along the road, and flying, with its large, black,
      flapping wings, from post to post of the fence, or from tree to tree. At
      last he gave up the pursuit with a croak of disappointment. The driver
      said, perhaps correctly, that the crow had scented some salmon which was
      in a basket under the seat, and that this was the secret of his pursuing
      us. This would be a terrific incident if it were a dead body that the crow
      scented, instead of a basket of salmon. Suppose, for instance, in a coach
      travelling along, that one of the passengers suddenly should die, and that
      one of the indications of his death would be this deportment of the crow.
    </p>
    <p>
      July 29th.&mdash;Remarkable characters:&mdash;A disagreeable figure,
      waning from middle age, clad in a pair of tow homespun pantaloons, and a
      very soiled shirt, barefoot, and with one of his feet maimed by an axe;
      also an arm amputated two or three inches below the elbow. His beard of a
      week's growth, grim and grisly, with a general effect of black; altogether
      a disgusting object. Yet he has the signs of having been a handsome man in
      his idea, though now such a beastly figure that probably no living thing
      but his great dog would touch him without an effort. Coming to the stoop,
      where several persons were sitting, "Good morning, gentlemen," said the
      wretch. Nobody answered for a time, till at last one said, "I don't know
      whom you speak to: not to me, I'm sure" (meaning that he did not claim to
      be a gentleman). "Why, I thought I spoke to you all at once," replied the
      figure, laughing. So he sat himself down on the lower step of the stoop,
      and began to talk; and, the conversation being turned upon his bare feet
      by one of the company, he related the story of his losing his toes by the
      glancing aside of an axe, and with what great fortitude he bore it. Then
      he made a transition to the loss of his arm, and, setting his teeth and
      drawing in his breath, said that the pain was dreadful; but this, too, he
      seems to have borne like an Indian; and a person testified to his
      fortitude by saying that he did not suppose there was any feeling in him,
      from observing how he bore it. The man spoke of the pain of cutting the
      muscles, and the particular agony at one moment, while the bone was being
      sawed asunder; and there was a strange expression of remembered anguish,
      as he shrugged his half-limb, and described the matter. Afterwards, in a
      reply to a question of mine, whether he still seemed to feel the hand that
      had been amputated, he answered that he did always; and, baring the stump,
      he moved the severed muscles, saying, "There is the thumb, there the
      forefinger," and so on. Then he talked to me about phrenology, of which he
      seems a firm believer and skilful practitioner, telling how he had hit
      upon the true character of many people. There was a great deal of sense
      and acuteness in his talk, and something of elevation in his expressions,&mdash;perhaps
      a studied elevation,&mdash;and a sort of courtesy in his manner; but his
      sense had something out of the way in it; there was something wild and
      ruined and desperate in his talk, though I can hardly say what it was.
      There was a trace of the gentleman and man of intellect through his deep
      degradation; and a pleasure in intellectual pursuits, and an acuteness and
      trained judgment, which bespoke a mind once strong and cultivated. "My
      study is man," said he. And looking at me, "I do not know your name," he
      said, "but there is something of the hawk-eye about you, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      This man was formerly a lawyer in good practice; but, taking to drinking,
      was reduced to the lowest state. Yet not the lowest; for after the
      amputation of his arm, being advised by divers persons to throw himself
      upon the public for support, he told them that, even if he should lose his
      other arm, he would still be able to support himself and a servant.
      Certainly he is a strong-minded and iron-constitutioned man; hut, looking
      at the stump of his arm, he said that the pain of the mind was a thousand
      times greater than the pain of the body. "That hand could make the pen go
      fast," said he. Among people in general, he does not seem to have any
      greater consideration in his ruin because of his former standing in
      society. He supports himself by making soap; and, on account of the offals
      used in that business, there is probably rather an evil odor in his
      domicile. Talking about a dead horse near his house, he said that he could
      not bear the scent of it. "I should not think you could smell carrion in
      that house," said a stage agent. Whereupon the soap-maker dropped his
      head, with a little snort, as it were, of wounded feeling; but immediately
      said that he took all in good part. There was an old squire of the
      village, a lawyer probably, whose demeanor was different,&mdash; with a
      distance, yet with a kindliness; for he remembered the times when they met
      on equal terms. "You and I," said the squire, alluding to their respective
      troubles and sicknesses, "would have died long ago, if we had not had the
      courage to live." The poor devil kept talking to me long after everybody
      else had left the stoop, giving vent to much practical philosophy, and
      just observation on the ways of men, mingled with rather more assumption
      of literature and cultivation than belonged to the present condition of
      his mind. Meantime his great dog, a cleanly looking and not ill-bred dog,
      being the only decent attribute appertaining to his master,&mdash;a
      well-natured dog, too, and receiving civilly any demonstration of courtesy
      from other people, though preserving a certain distance of deportment,&mdash;this
      great dog grew weary of his master's lengthy talk, and expressed his
      impatience to be gone by thrusting himself between his legs, rolling over
      on his back, seizing his ragged trousers, or playfully taking his maimed,
      bare foot into his mouth,&mdash;using, in short, the kindly and humorous
      freedom of a friend, with a wretch to whom all are free enough, but none
      other kind. His master rebuked him, but with kindness too, and not so that
      the dog felt himself bound to desist, though he seemed willing to allow
      his master all the time that could possibly be spared. And at last, having
      said many times that he must go and shave and dress himself,&mdash;and as
      his beard had been at least a week growing, it might have seemed almost a
      week's work to get rid of it,&mdash;he rose from the stoop and went his
      way,&mdash;a forlorn and miserable thing in the light of the cheerful
      summer morning. Yet he seems to keep his spirits up, and still preserves
      himself a man among men, asking nothing from them; nor is it clearly
      perceptible what right they have to scorn him, though he seems to
      acquiesce, in a manner, in their doing so. And yet he cannot wholly have
      lost his self-respect; and doubtless there were persons on the stoop more
      grovelling than himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another character:&mdash;A blacksmith of fifty or upwards, a corpulent
      figure, big in the paunch and enormous in the rear; yet there is such an
      appearance of strength and robustness in his frame, that his corpulence
      appears very proper and necessary to him. A pound of flesh could not be
      spared from his abundance, any more than from the leanest man; and he
      walks about briskly, without any panting or symptom of labor or pain in
      his motion. He has a round, jolly face, always mirthful and humorous and
      shrewd, and the air of a man well to do, and well respected, yet not
      caring much about the opinions of men, because his independence is
      sufficient to itself. Nobody would take him for other than a man of some
      importance in the community, though his summer dress is a tow-cloth pair
      of pantaloons, a shirt not of the cleanest, open at the breast, and the
      sleeves rolled up at the elbows, and a straw hat. There is not such a vast
      difference between this costume and that of Lawyer H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      above mentioned, yet never was there a greater diversity of appearance
      than between these two men; and a glance at them would be sufficient to
      mark the difference. The blacksmith loves his glass, and comes to the
      tavern for it, whenever it seems good to him, not calling for it slyly and
      shyly, but marching steadily to the bar, or calling across the room for it
      to be prepared. He speaks with great bitterness against the new license
      law, and vows if it be not repealed by fair means it shall be by violence,
      and that he will be as ready to cock his rifle for such a cause as for any
      other. On this subject his talk is really fierce; but as to all other
      matters he is good-natured and good-hearted, fond of joke, and shaking his
      jolly sides with frequent laughter. His conversation has much strong,
      unlettered sense, imbued with humor, as everybody's talk is in New
      England.
    </p>
    <p>
      He takes a queer position sometimes,&mdash;queer for his figure
      particularly, &mdash;straddling across a chair, facing the back, with his
      arms resting thereon, and his chin on them, for the benefit of conversing
      closely with some one. When he has spent as much time in the bar-room or
      under the stoop as he chooses to spare, he gets up at once, and goes off
      with a brisk, vigorous pace. He owns a mill, and seems to be prosperous in
      the world. I know no man who seems more like a man, more indescribably
      human, than this sturdy blacksmith.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came in the afternoon a respectable man in gray homespun cloth, who
      arrived in a wagon, I believe, and began to inquire, after supper, about a
      certain new kind of mill machinery. Being referred to the blacksmith, who
      owned one of these mills, the stranger said that he had come from Vermont
      to learn about the matter. "What may I call your name?" said he to the
      blacksmith. "My name is Hodge," replied the latter. "I believe I have
      heard of you," said the stranger. Then they colloquied at much length
      about the various peculiarities and merits of the new invention. The
      stranger continued here two or three days, making his researches, and
      forming acquaintance with several millwrights and others. He was a man
      evidently of influence in his neighborhood, and the tone of his
      conversation was in the style of one accustomed to be heard with
      deference, though all in a plain and homely way. Lawyer H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      took notice of this manner; for the talk being about the nature of soap,
      and the evil odor arising from that process, the stranger joined in.
      "There need not be any disagreeable smell in making soap," said he. "Now
      we are to receive a lesson," said H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, and the remark
      was particularly apropos to the large wisdom of the stranger's tone and
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he gave an account of the process in his domestic establishment,
      saying that he threw away the whole offals of the hog, as not producing
      any soap, and preserved the skins of the intestines for sausages. He
      seemed to be hospitable, inviting those with whom he did business to take
      "a mouthful of dinner" with him, and treating them with liquors; for he
      was not an utter temperance man, though moderate in his potations. I
      suspect he would turn out a pattern character of the upper class of New
      England yeomen, if I had an opportunity of studying him. Doubtless he had
      been selectman, representative, and justice, and had filled all but
      weighty offices. He was highly pleased with the new mill contrivance, and
      expressed his opinion that, when his neighbors saw the success of his, it
      would be extensively introduced into that vicinity.

      Mem. The hostlers at taverns call the money given them "pergasus,"&mdash;
      corrupted from "perquisites." Otherwise "knock-down money." Remarkable
      character:&mdash;A travelling surgeon-dentist, who has taken a room in the
      North Adams House, and sticks up his advertising bills on the pillars of
      the piazza, and all about the town. He is a tall, slim young man, six feet
      two, dressed in a country-made coat of light blue (taken, as he tells me,
      in exchange for dental operations), black pantaloons, and clumsy, cowhide
      hoots. Self-conceit is very strongly expressed in his air; and a doctor
      once told him that he owed his life to that quality; for, by keeping
      himself so stiffly upright, he opens his chest, and counteracts a
      consumptive tendency. He is not only a dentist, which trade he follows
      temporarily, but a licensed preacher of the Baptist persuasion, and is now
      on his way to the West to seek a place of settlement in his spiritual
      vocation. Whatever education he possesses, he has acquired by his own
      exertions since the age of twenty-one,&mdash;he being now twenty-four. We
      talk together very freely; and he has given me an account, among other
      matters, of all his love-affairs, which are rather curious, as
      illustrative of the life of a smart young country fellow in relation to
      the gentle sex. Nothing can exceed the exquisite self-conceit which
      characterizes these confidences, and which is expressed inimitably in his
      face, his upturned nose, and mouth, so as to be truly a caricature; and he
      seems strangely to find as much food for his passion in having been jilted
      once or twice as in his conquests. It is curious to notice his revengeful
      feeling against the false ones,&mdash; hidden from himself, however, under
      the guise of religious interest, and desire that they may be cured of
      their follies.

      A little boy named Joe, who haunts about the bar-room and the stoop, four
      years old, in a thin, short jacket, and full-breeched trousers, and bare
      feet. The men tease him, and put quids of tobacco in his mouth, under
      pretence of giving him a fig; and he gets curaged, and utters a peculiar,
      sharp, spiteful cry, and strikes at them with a stick, to their great
      mirth. He is always in trouble, yet will not keep away. They despatch him
      with two or three cents to buy candy and nuts and raisins. They set him
      down in a niche of the door, and tell him to remain there a day and a
      half: he sits down very demurely, as if he meant to fulfil his penance;
      but a moment after, behold! there is little Joe capering across the street
      to join two or three boys who are playing in a wagon. Take this boy as the
      germ of a tavern-haunter, a country roue, to spend a wild and brutal
      youth, ten years of his prime in the State Prison, and his old age in the
      poorhouse.

      There are a great many dogs kept in the village, and many of the
      travellers also have dogs. Some are almost always playing about; and if a
      cow or a pig be passing, two or three of them scamper forth for an attack.
      Some of the younger sort chase pigeons, wheeling as they wheel. If a
      contest arises between two dogs, a number of others come with huge barking
      to join the fray, though I believe that they do not really take any active
      part in the contest, but swell the uproar by way of encouraging the
      combatants. When a traveller is starting from the door, his dog often gets
      in front of the horse, placing his forefeet down,&mdash; looking the horse
      in the face, and barking loudly, then, as the horse comes on, running a
      little farther, and repeating the process; and this he does in spite of
      his master's remonstrances, till, the horse being fairly started, the dog
      follows on quietly. One dog, a diminutive little beast, has been taught to
      stand on his hind legs, and rub his face with his paw, which he does with
      an aspect of much endurance and deprecation. Another springs at people
      whom his master points out to him, barking and pretending to bite. These
      tricks make much mirth in the bar-room. All dogs, of whatever different
      sizes and dissimilar varieties, acknowledge the common bond of species
      among themselves, and the largest one does not disdain to suffer his tail
      to be smelt of, nor to reciprocate that courtesy to the smallest. They
      appear to take much interest in one another; but there is always a degree
      of caution between two strange dogs when they meet.

    <p>
      July 31st.&mdash;A visit to what is called "Hudson's Cave," or "Hudson's
      Falls," the tradition being that a man by the name of Henry Hudson, many
      years ago, chasing a deer, the deer fell over the place, which then first
      became known to white men. It is not properly a cave, but a fissure in a
      huge ledge of marble, through which a stream has been for ages forcing its
      way, and has left marks of its gradually wearing power on the tall crags,
      having made curious hollows from the summit down to the level which it has
      reached at the present day. The depth of the fissure in some places is at
      least fifty or sixty feet, perhaps more, and at several points it nearly
      closes over, and often the sight of the sky is hidden by the interposition
      of masses of the marble crags. The fissure is very irregular, so as not to
      be describable in words, and scarcely to be painted,&mdash;jetting
      buttresses, moss-grown, impending crags, with tall trees growing on their
      verge, nodding over the head of the observer at the bottom of the chasm,
      and rooted, as it were, in air. The part where the water works its way
      down is very narrow; but the chasm widens, after the descent, so as to
      form a spacious chamber between the crags, open to the sky, and its floor
      is strewn with fallen fragments of marble, and trees that have been
      precipitated long ago, and are heaped with drift-wood, left there by the
      freshets, when the scanty stream becomes a considerable waterfall. One
      crag, with a narrow ridge, which might be climbed without much difficulty,
      protrudes from the middle of the rock, and divides the fall. The passage
      through the cave made by the stream is very crooked, and interrupted, not
      only by fallen wrecks, but by deep pools of water, which probably have
      been forded by few. As the deepest pool occurs in the most uneven part of
      the chasm, where the hollows in the sides of the crag are deepest, so that
      each hollow is almost a cave by itself, I determined to wade through it.
      There was an accumulation of soft stuff on the bottom, so that the water
      did not look more than knee-deep; but, finding that my feet sunk in it, I
      took off my trousers, and waded through up to my middle. Thus I reached
      the most interesting part of the cave, where the whirlings of the stream
      had left the marks of its eddies in the solid marble, all up and down the
      two sides of the chasm. The water is now dammed for the construction of
      two marble saw-mills, else it would have been impossible to effect the
      passage; and I presume that, for years after the cave was discovered, the
      waters roared and tore their way in a torrent through this part of the
      chasm. While I was there, I heard voices, and a small stone tumbled down;
      and looking up towards the narrow strip of bright light, and the sunny
      verdure that peeped over the top,&mdash;looking up thither from the deep,
      gloomy depth,&mdash;I saw two or three men; and, not liking to be to them
      the most curious part of the spectacle, I waded back, and put on my
      clothes. The marble crags are overspread with a concretion, which makes
      them look as gray as granite, except where the continual flow of water
      keeps them of a snowy whiteness. If they were so white all over, it would
      be a splendid show. There is a marble-quarry close in the rear, above the
      cave, and in process of time the whole of the crags will be quarried into
      tombstones, doorsteps, fronts of edifices, fireplaces, etc. That will be a
      pity. On such portions of the walls as are within reach, visitors have
      sculptured their initials, or names at full length; and the white letters
      showing plainly on the gray surface, they have more obvious effect than
      such inscriptions generally have. There was formerly, I believe, a
      complete arch of marble, forming a natural bridge over the top of the
      cave; but this is no longer so. At the bottom of the broad chamber of the
      cave, standing in its shadow, the effect of the morning sunshine on the
      dark or bright foliage of the pines and other trees that cluster on the
      summits of the crags was particularly beautiful; and it was strange how
      such great trees had rooted themselves in solid marble, for so it seemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      After passing through this romantic and most picturesque spot, the stream
      goes onward to turn factories. Here its voice resounds within the hollow
      crags; there it goes onward; talking to itself, with babbling din, of its
      own wild thoughts and fantasies,&mdash;the voice of solitude and the
      wilderness,&mdash;loud and continual, but which yet does not seem to
      disturb the thoughtful wanderer, so that he forgets there is a noise. It
      talks along its storm-strewn path; it talks beneath tall precipices and
      high banks,&mdash;a voice that has been the same for innumerable ages; and
      yet, if you listen, you will perceive a continual change and variety in
      its babble, and sometimes it seems to swell louder upon the ear than at
      others,&mdash;in the same spot, I mean. By and by man makes a dam for it,
      and it pours over it, still making its voice heard, while it labors. At
      one shop for manufacturing the marble, I saw the disk of a sun-dial as
      large as the top of a hogshead, intended for Williams College; also a
      small obelisk, and numerous gravestones. The marble is coarse-grained, but
      of a very brilliant whiteness. It is rather a pity that the cave is not
      formed of some worthless stone.

      In the deep valleys of the neighborhood, where the shadows at sunset are
      thrown from mountain to mountain, the clouds have a beautiful effect,
      flitting high over them, bright with heavenly gold. It seems as if the
      soul might rise up from the gloom, and alight upon them and soar away.
      Walking along one of the valleys the other evening, while a pretty fresh
      breeze blew across it, the clouds that were skimming over my head seemed
      to conform themselves to the valley's shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a distance, mountain summits look close together, almost as if forming
      one mountain, though in reality a village lies in the depths between them.

      A steam-engine in a factory to be supposed to possess a malignant spirit.
      It catches one man's arm, and pulls it off; seizes another by the
      coat-tails, and almost grapples him bodily; catches a girl by the hair,
      and scalps her; and finally draws in a man, and crushes him to death.

      The one-armed soap-maker, Lawyer H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, wears an iron

      They nickname him "Black Hawk."
    </p>
    <p>
      North Adams still.&mdash;The village, viewed from the top of a hill to the
      westward at sunset, has a peculiarly happy and peaceful look. It lies on a
      level, surrounded by hills, and seems as if it lay in the hollow of a
      large hand. The Union Village may be seen, a manufacturing place,
      extending up a gorge of the hills. It is amusing to see all the
      distributed property of the aristocracy and commonalty, the various and
      conflicting interests of the town, the loves and hates, compressed into a
      space which the eye takes in as completely as the arrangement of a
      tea-table. The rush of the streams comes up the hill somewhat like the
      sound of a city.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hills about the village appear very high and steep sometimes, when the
      shadows of the clouds are thrown blackly upon them, while there is
      sunshine elsewhere; so that, seen in front, the effect of their gradual
      slope is lost. These hills, surrounding the town on all sides, give it a
      snug and insulated air; and, viewed from certain points, it would be
      difficult to tell how to get out, without climbing the mountain ridges;
      but the roads wind away and accomplish the passage without ascending very
      high. Sometimes the notes of a horn or bugle may be heard sounding afar
      among these passes of the mountains, announcing the coming of the
      stage-coach from Bennington or Troy or Greenfield or Pittsfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are multitudes of sheep among the hills, and they appear very tame
      and gentle; though sometimes, like the wicked, they "flee when no man
      pursueth." But, climbing a rude, rough, rocky, stumpy, ferny height
      yesterday, one or two of them stood and stared at me with great
      earnestness. I passed on quietly, but soon heard an immense baa-ing up the
      hill, and all the sheep came galloping and scrambling after me, baa-ing
      with all their might in innumerable voices, running in a compact body,
      expressing the utmost eagerness, as if they sought the greatest imaginable
      favor from me; and so they accompanied me down the hillside,&mdash; a most
      ridiculous cortege. Doubtless they had taken it into their heads that I
      brought them salt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aspect of the village is peculiarly beautiful towards sunset, when
      there are masses of cloud about the sky,&mdash;the remnants of a
      thunder-storm. These clouds throw a shade upon large portions of the
      rampart of hills, and the hills towards the west are shaded of course; the
      clouds also make the shades deeper in the village, and thus the sunshine
      on the houses and trees, and along the street, is a bright, rich gold. The
      green is deeper in consequence of the recent rain.

      The doctors walk about the village with their saddle-bags on their arms,

      A little dog, named Snapper, the same who stands on his hind legs, appears
      to be a roguish little dog, and the other day he stole one of the
      servant-girl's shoes, and ran into the street with it. Being pursued, he
      would lift the shoe in his mouth (while it almost dragged on the ground),
      and run a little way, then lie down with his paws on it, and wait to be
      pursued again.

    <p>
      August 11th.&mdash;This morning, it being cloudy and boding of rain, the
      clouds had settled upon the mountains, both on the summits and ridges, all
      round the town, so that there seemed to be no way of gaining access to the
      rest of the world, unless by climbing above the clouds. By and by they
      partially dispersed, giving glimpses of the mountain ramparts through
      their obscurity, the separate clouds lying heavily upon the mountain's
      breast. In warm mornings, after rain, the mist breaks forth from the
      forests on the ascent of the mountains, like smoke,&mdash;the smoke of a
      volcano; then it soars up, and becomes a cloud in heaven. But these clouds
      to-day were real rain-clouds. Sometimes, it is said, while laboring up the
      mountain-side, they suddenly burst, and pour down their moisture in a
      cataract, sweeping all before it.
    </p>

      Every new aspect of the mountains, or view from a different position,
      creates a surprise in the mind.

      Scenes and characters:&mdash;A young country fellow, twenty or
      thereabouts, decently dressed, pained with the toothache. A doctor,
      passing on horseback, with his black leather saddle-bags behind him, a
      thin, frosty-haired man. Being asked to operate, he looks at the tooth,
      lances the gum, and the fellow being content to be dealt with on the spot,
      he seats himself in a chair on the stoop with great heroism. The doctor
      produces a rusty pair of iron forceps; a man holds the patient's head; the
      doctor perceives that, it being a difficult tooth to get at, wedged
      between the two largest in his jaws, he must pull very hard; and the
      instrument is introduced. A turn of the doctor's hand; the patient begins
      to utter a cry, but the tooth comes out first, with four prongs. The
      patient gets up, half amazed, pays the doctor ninepence, pockets the
      tooth, and the spectators are in glee and admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a fat woman, a stage-passenger to-day,&mdash;a wonder how she
      could possibly get through the door, which seemed not so wide as she. When
      she put her foot on the step, the stage gave a great lurch, she joking all
      the while. A great, coarse, red-faced dame. Other passengers,&mdash;three
      or four slender Williamstown students, a young girl, and a man with one
      leg and two crutches.

    <p>
      One of the most sensible men in this village is a plain, tall, elderly
      person, who is overseeing the mending of a road,&mdash;humorous,
      intelligent, with much thought about matters and things; and while at work
      he has a sort of dignity in handling the hoe or crow-bar, which shows him
      to be the chief. In the evening he sits under the stoop, silent and
      observant from under the brim of his hat; but, occasion calling, he holds
      an argument about the benefit or otherwise of manufactories or other
      things. A simplicity characterizes him more than appertains to most
      Yankees.

      A man in a pea-green frock-coat, with velvet collar. Another in a flowered
      chintz frock-coat. There is a great diversity of hues in garments. A
      doctor, a stout, tall, round-paunched, red-faced, brutal-looking old
      fellow, who gets drunk daily. He sat down on the step of our stoop,
      looking surly, and speaking to nobody; then got up and walked homeward,
      with a morose swagger and a slight unevenness of gait, attended by a fine
      Newfoundland dog.

      A barouche with driver returned from beyond Greenfield or Troy empty, the
      passengers being left at the former place. The driver stops here for the
      night, and, while washing, enters into talk with an old man about the
      different roads over the mountain.

      A man with a cradle on his shoulder, having been cradling oats. I attended
      a child's funeral yesterday afternoon. There was an assemblage of people
      in a plain, homely apartment. Most of the men were dressed in their
      ordinary clothes, and one or two were in shirt-sleeves. The coffin was
      placed in the midst of us, covered with a velvet pall. A bepaid clergyman
      prayed (the audience remaining seated, while he stood up at the head of
      the coffin), read a passage of Scripture and commented upon it. While he
      read and prayed and expounded there was a heavy thunder-storm rumbling
      among the surrounding hills, and the lightning flashed fiercely through
      the gloomy room; and the preacher alluded to GOD's voice of thunder.

      It is the custom in this part of the country&mdash;and perhaps extensively
      in the interior of New England&mdash;to bury the dead first in a
      charnel-house, or common tomb, where they remain till decay has so far
      progressed as to secure them from the resurrectionists. They are then
      reburied, with certain ceremonies, in their own peculiar graves.

      O. E. S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, a widower of forty or upwards, with a son of
      twelve and a pair of infant twins. He is a sharp, shrewd Yankee, with a
      Yankee's license of honesty. He drinks sometimes more than enough, and is
      guilty of peccadilloes with the fair sex; yet speaks most affectionately
      of his wife, and is a fond and careful father. He is a tall, thin,
      hard-featured man, with a sly expression of almost hidden grave humor, as
      if there were some deviltry pretty constantly in his mind,&mdash;which is
      probably the case. His brother tells me that he was driven almost crazy by
      the loss of his wife. It appears to me that men are more affected by the
      deaths of their wives than wives by the deaths of their husbands. Orrin S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

      A walk this forenoon up the mountain ridge that walls in the town towards
      the east. The road is cut zigzag, the mountain being generally as steep as
      the roof of a house; yet the stage to Greenfield passes over this road two
      or three times a week. Graylock rose up behind me, appearing, with its two
      summits and a long ridge between, like a huge monster crouching down
      slumbering, with its head slightly elevated. Graylock is properly the name
      for the highest elevation. It appeared to better advantage the higher the
      point from which I viewed it. There were houses scattered here and there
      up the mountainside, growing poorer as I ascended; the last that I passed
      was a mean log-hut, rough, rude, and dilapidated, with the smoke issuing
      from a chimney of small stones, plastered with clay; around it a garden of
      beans, with some attempt at flowers, and a green creeper running over the
      side of the cottage. Above this point there were various excellent views
      of mountain scenery, far off and near, and one village lying below in the
      hollow vale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having climbed so far that the road seemed now to go downward, I retraced
      my steps. There was a wagon descending behind me; and as it followed the
      zigzag of the road I could hear the voices of the men high over my head,
      and sometimes I caught a glimpse of the wagon almost perpendicularly above
      me, while I was looking almost perpendicularly down to the log-hut
      aforementioned. Trees were thick on either hand,&mdash;oaks, pines, and
      others; and marble occasionally peeped up in the road and there was a
      lime-kiln by the wayside, ready for burning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Graylock had a cloud on his head this morning, the base of a heavy white
      cloud. The distribution of the sunshine amid mountain scenery is very
      striking; one does not see exactly why one spot should be in deep
      obscurity while others are all bright. The clouds throw their shadows upon
      the hillsides as they move slowly along,&mdash;a transitory blackness.
    </p>

      I passed a doctor high up the road in a sulky, with his black leather
      saddle-bags.

      Hudson's Cave is formed by Hudson's Brook. There is a natural arch of
      marble still in one part of it. The cliffs are partly made verdant with
      green moss, chiefly gray with oxidation; on some parts the white of the
      marble is seen; in interstices grow brake and other shrubs, so that there
      is naked sublimity seen through a good deal of clustering beauty. Above,
      the birch, poplars, and pines grow on the utmost verge of the cliffs,
      which jut far over, so that they are suspended in air; and whenever the
      sunshine finds its way into the depths of the chasm, the branches wave
      across it. There is a lightness, however, about their foliage, which
      greatly relieves what would otherwise be a gloomy scene. After the passage
      of the stream through the cliffs of marble, the cliffs separate on either
      side, and leave it to flow onward; intercepting its passage, however, by
      fragments of marble, some of them huge ones, which the cliffs have flung
      down, thundering into the bed of the stream through numberless ages.
      Doubtless some of these immense fragments had trees growing on them, which
      have now mouldered away. Decaying trunks are heaped in various parts of
      the gorge. The pieces of marble that are washed by the water are of a
      snow-white, and partially covered with a bright green water-moss, making a
      beautiful contrast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the cliffs, strips of earth-beach extend downward, and trees and
      large shrubs root themselves in that earth, thus further contrasting the
      nakedness of the stone with their green foliage. But the immediate part
      where the stream forces its winding passage through the rock is stern,
      dark, and mysterious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the road, where it runs beneath a steep, there are high ridges,
      covered with trees,&mdash;the dew of midnight damping the earth, far
      towards midnoon. I observed the shadows of water-insects, as they swam in
      the pools of a stream. Looking down a streamlet, I saw a trunk of a tree,
      which has been overthrown by the wind, so as to form a bridge, yet
      sticking up all its branches, as if it were unwilling to assist anybody
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Green leaves, following the eddies of the rivulet, were now borne deep
      under water, and now emerged. Great uprooted trees, adhering midway down a
      precipice of earth, hung with their tops downward.

      There is an old man, selling the meats of butternuts under the stoop of
      the hotel. He makes that his station during a part of the season. He was
      dressed in a dark thin coat, ribbed velvet pantaloons, and a sort of
      moccasins, or shoes, appended to the legs of woollen stockings. He had on
      a straw hat, and his hair was gray, with a long, thin visage. His nuts
      were contained in a square tin box, having two compartments, one for the
      nuts, and another for maple sugar, which he sells in small cakes. He had
      three small tin measures for nuts,&mdash;one at one cent, others at two,
      four, and six cents; and as fast as they were emptied, he filled them
      again, and put them on the top of his box. He smoked a pipe, and talked
      with one man about whether it would be worth while to grow young again,
      and the duty of being contented with old age; about predestination and
      freewill and other metaphysics. I asked him what his sales amounted to in
      the course of a day. He said that butternuts did not sell so well as
      walnuts, which are not yet in season; that he might to-day have sold fifty
      cents' worth of walnuts, never less than a dollar's worth, often more; and
      when he went round with a caravan, he had sold fifteen dollars' worth per
      day, and once as much as twenty dollars' worth. This promises to be an
      excellent year for walnuts. Chestnuts have been scarce for two or three
      years. He had one hundred chestnut-trees on his own land, and last year he
      offered a man twenty-five cents if he would find him a quart of good
      chestnuts on them. A bushel of walnuts would cost about ten dollars. He
      wears a pair of silver-rimmed spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      A drunken fellow sat down by him, and bought a cent's worth of his
      butternuts, and inquired what he would sell out to him for. The old man
      made an estimate, though evidently in jest, and then reckoned his box,
      measures, meats, and what little maple sugar he had, at four dollars. He
      had a very quiet manner, and expressed an intention of going to the
      Commencement at Williamstown to-morrow. His name, I believe, is Captain
      Gavett.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wednesday, August 15th.&mdash;I went to Commencement at Williams College,&mdash;
      five miles distant. At the tavern were students with ribbons, pink or
      blue, fluttering from their buttonholes, these being the badges of rival
      societies. There was a considerable gathering of people, chiefly arriving
      in wagons or buggies, some in barouches, and very few in chaises. The most
      characteristic part of the scene was where the pedlers,
      gingerbread-sellers, etc., were collected, a few hundred yards from the
      meeting-house. There was a pedler there from New York State, who sold his
      wares by auction, and I could have stood and listened to him all day long.
      Sometimes he would put up a heterogeny [this is a word made by Mr.
      Hawthorne, but one that was needed.&mdash;S. H.] of articles in a lot,&mdash;as
      a paper of pins, a lead-pencil, and a shaving-box,&mdash;and knock them
      all down, perhaps for ninepence. Bunches of lead-pencils, steel-pens,
      pound-cakes of shaving-soap, gilt finger-rings, bracelets, clasps, and
      other jewelry, cards of pearl buttons, or steel ("there is some steel
      about them, gentlemen, for my brother stole 'em, and I bore him out in
      it"), bundles of wooden combs, boxes of matches, suspenders, and, in
      short, everything,&mdash;dipping his hand down into his wares with the
      promise of a wonderful lot, and producing, perhaps, a bottle of opodeldoc,
      and joining it with a lead-pencil,&mdash;and when he had sold several
      things of the same kind, pretending huge surprise at finding "just one
      more," if the lads lingered; saying, "I could not afford to steal them for
      the price; for the remorse of conscience would be worth more,"&mdash;all
      the time keeping an eye upon those who bought, calling for the pay, making
      change with silver or bills, and deciding on the goodness of banks; and
      saying to the boys who climbed upon his cart, "Fall down, roll down,
      tumble down, only get down"; and uttering everything in the queer,
      humorous recitative in which he sold his articles. Sometimes he would
      pretend that a person had bid, either by word or wink, and raised a laugh
      thus; never losing his self-possession, nor getting out of humor. When a
      man asked whether a bill were good: "No! do you suppose I'd give you good
      money?" When he delivered an article, he exclaimed, "You're the lucky
      man," setting off his wares with the most extravagant eulogies. The people
      bought very freely, and seemed also to enjoy the fun. One little boy
      bought a shaving-box, perhaps meaning to speculate upon it. This character
      could not possibly he overdrawn; and he was really excellent, with his
      allusions to what was passing, intermingled, doubtless, with a good deal
      that was studied. He was a man between thirty and forty, with a face
      expressive of other ability, as well as of humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good many people were the better or the worse for liquor. There was one
      fellow,&mdash;named Randall, I think,&mdash;a round-shouldered, bulky,
      ill-hung devil, with a pale, sallow skin, black beard, and a sort of grin
      upon his face,&mdash;a species of laugh, yet not so much mirthful as
      indicating a strange mental and moral twist. He was very riotous in the
      crowd, elbowing, thrusting, seizing hold of people; and at last a ring was
      formed, and a regular wrestling-match commenced between him and a
      farmer-looking man. Randall brandished his legs about in the most
      ridiculous style, but proved himself a good wrestler, and finally threw
      his antagonist. He got up with the same grin upon his features,&mdash;not
      a grin of simplicity, but intimating knowingness. When more depth or force
      of expression was required, he could put on the most strangely ludicrous
      and ugly aspect (suiting his gesture and attitude to it) that can be
      imagined. I should like to see this fellow when he was perfectly sober.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were a good many blacks among the crowd. I suppose they used to
      emigrate across the border, while New York was a slave State. There were
      enough of them to form a party, though greatly in the minority; and, a
      squabble arising, some of the blacks were knocked down, and otherwise
      maltreated. I saw one old negro, a genuine specimen of the slave negro,
      without any of the foppery of the race in our part of the State,&mdash;an
      old fellow, with a bag, I suppose of broken victuals, on his shoulder, and
      his pockets stuffed out at his hips with the like provender; full of
      grimaces and ridiculous antics, laughing laughably, yet without
      affectation; then talking with a strange kind of pathos about the
      whippings he used to get while he was a slave;&mdash;a singular creature,
      of mere feeling, with some glimmering of sense. Then there was another
      gray old negro, but of a different stamp, politic, sage, cautious, yet
      with boldness enough, talking about the rights of his race, yet so as not
      to provoke his audience; discoursing of the advantage of living under
      laws, and the wonders that might ensue, in that very assemblage, if there
      were no laws; in the midst of this deep wisdom, turning off the anger of a
      half-drunken fellow by a merry retort, a leap in the air, and a negro's
      laugh. I was interested&mdash;there being a drunken negro ascending the
      meeting-house steps, and near him three or four well-dressed and decent
      negro wenches&mdash;to see the look of scorn and shame and sorrow and
      painful sympathy which one of them assumed at this disgrace of her color.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people here show out their character much more strongly than they do
      with us; there was not the quiet, silent, dull decency of our public
      assemblages, but mirth, anger, eccentricity,&mdash;all manifesting
      themselves freely. There were many watermelons for sale, and people
      burying their muzzles deep in the juicy flesh of them. There were cider
      and beer. Many of the people had their mouths half opened in a grin,
      which, more than anything else, I think, indicates a low stage of
      refinement. A low-crowned hat&mdash;very low&mdash;is common. They are
      respectful to gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bat being startled, probably, out of the meeting-house, by the commotion
      around, flew blindly about in the sunshine, and alighted on a man's
      sleeve. I looked at him,&mdash;a droll, winged, beast-insect, creeping up
      the man's arm, not over-clean, and scattering dust on the man's coat from
      his vampire wings. The man stared at him, and let the spectators stare for
      a minute, and then shook him gently off; and the poor devil took a flight
      across the green to the meeting-house, and then, I believe, alighted on
      somebody else. Probably he was put to death. Bats are very numerous in
      these parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a drunken man, annoying people with his senseless talk and
      impertinences, impelled to perform eccentricities by an evil spirit in
      him; and a pale little boy, with a bandaged leg, whom his father brought
      out of the tavern and put into a barouche. Then the boy heedfully placed
      shawls and cushions about his leg to support it, his face expressive of
      pain and care,&mdash;not transitory, but settled pain, of long and
      forcedly patient, endurance; and this painful look, perhaps, gave his face
      more intelligence than it might otherwise have had, though it was
      naturally a sensitive face. Well-dressed ladies were in the meeting-house
      in silks and cambrics,&mdash;the sunburnt necks in contiguity with the
      delicate fabrics of the dresses showing the yeomen's daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Country graduates,&mdash;rough, brown-featured, schoolmaster-looking,
      half-bumpkin, half-scholarly figures, in black ill-cut broadcloth,&mdash;their
      manners quite spoilt by what little of the gentleman there was in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord of the tavern keeping his eye on a man whom he suspected of
      an intention to bolt. [A word meaning in Worcester, I find, "to spring out
      with speed and suddenness."&mdash;S. H.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day after Commencement was bleak and rainy from midnight till
      midnight, and a good many guests were added to our table in consequence.
      Among them were some of the Williamstown students, gentlemanly young
      fellows, with a brotherly feeling for each other, a freedom about money
      concerns, a half-boyish, half-manly character; and my heart warmed to
      them. They took their departure&mdash;two for South Adams and two across
      the Green Mountains&mdash;in the midst of the rain. There was one of the
      graduates with his betrothed, and his brother-in-law and wife, who stayed
      during the day,&mdash;the graduate the very model of a country
      schoolmaster in his Sunday clothes, being his Commencement suit of black
      broadcloth and pumps. He is engaged as assistant teacher of the academy at
      Shelburne Falls. There was also the high sheriff of Berkshire, Mr.
      Twining, with a bundle of writs under his arm, and some of them peeping
      out of his pockets. Also several Trojan men and women, who had been to
      Commencement. Likewise a young clergyman, graduate of Brown College, and
      student of the Divinity School at Cambridge. He had come across the
      Hoosic, or Green Mountains, about eighteen miles, on foot, from
      Charlemont, where he is preaching, and had been to Commencement. Knowing
      little of men and matters, and desiring to know more, he was very free in
      making acquaintance with people, but could not do it handsomely. A
      singular smile broke out upon his face on slight provocation. He was
      awkward in his manners, yet it was not an ungentlemanly awkwardness,&mdash;
      intelligent as respects book-learning, but much deficient in worldly tact.
      It was pleasant to observe his consciousness of this deficiency, and how
      he strove to remedy it by mixing as much as possible with people, and
      sitting almost all day in the bar-room to study character. Sometimes he
      would endeavor to contribute his share to the general amusement,&mdash;as
      by growling comically, to provoke and mystify a dog; and by some bashful
      and half-apropos observations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon there came a fresh bevy of students onward from
      Williamstown; but they made only a transient visit, though it was still
      raining. These were a rough-hewn, heavy set of fellows, from the hills and
      woods in this neighborhood,&mdash;great unpolished bumpkins, who had grown
      up farmer-boys, and had little of the literary man, save green spectacles
      and black broadcloth (which all of them had not), talking with a broad
      accent, and laughing clown-like, while sheepishness overspread all,
      together with a vanity at being students. One of the party was six feet
      seven inches high, and all his herculean dimensions were in proportion;
      his features, too, were cast in a mould suitable to his stature. This
      giant was not ill-looking, but of a rattier intelligent aspect. His
      motions were devoid of grace, but yet had a rough freedom, appropriate
      enough to such a figure. These fellows stayed awhile, talked uncouthly
      about college matters, and started in the great open wagon which had
      brought them and their luggage hither. We had a fire in the bar-room
      almost all day,&mdash;a great, blazing fire,&mdash;and it was pleasant to
      have this day of bleak November weather, and cheerful fireside talk, and
      wet garments smoking in the fireside heat, still in the summer-time. Thus
      the day wore on with a sort of heavy, lazy pleasantness; and night set in,
      still stormy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning it was cloudy, but did not rain, and I went with the little
      clergyman to Hudson's Cave. The stream which they call the North Branch,
      and into which Hudson's Brook empties, was much swollen, and tumbled and
      dashed and whitened over the rocks, and formed real cascades over the
      dams, and rushed fast along the side of the cliffs, which had their feet
      in it. Its color was deep brown, owing to the washing of the banks which
      the rain had poured into it. Looking back, we could see a cloud on
      Graylock; but on other parts of Saddle Mountain there were spots of
      sunshine, some of most glorious brightness, contrasting with the general
      gloom of the sky, and the deep shadow which lay on the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      We looked at the spot where the stream makes its entrance into the marble
      cliff, and it was (this morning, at least) the most striking view of the
      cave. The water dashed down in a misty cascade, through what looked like
      the portal of some infernal subterranean structure; and far within the
      portal we could see the mist and the falling water; and it looked as if,
      but for these obstructions of view, we might have had a deeper insight
      into a gloomy region.
    </p>
    <p>
      After our return, the little minister set off for his eighteen miles'
      journey across the mountain; and I was occupied the rest of the forenoon
      with an affair of stealing&mdash;a woman of forty or upwards being accused
      of stealing a needle-case and other trifles from a factory-girl at a
      boarding-house. She came here to take passage in a stage; but Putnam, a
      justice of the peace, examined her and afterwards ordered her to be
      searched by Laura and Eliza, the chambermaid and table-waiter. Hereupon
      was much fun and some sympathy. They searched, and found nothing that they
      sought, though she gave up a pair of pantalets, which she pretended to
      have taken by mistake. Afterwards, she being in the parlor, I went in; and
      she immediately began to talk to me, giving me an account of the affair,
      speaking with the bitterness of a wronged person, with a sparkling eye,
      yet with great fluency and self-possession. She is a yellow, thin, and
      battered old thing, yet rather country-lady-like in aspect and manners. I
      heard Eliza telling another girl about it, under my window; and she seemed
      to think that the poor woman's reluctance to be searched arose from the
      poorness of her wardrobe and of the contents of her bandbox.
    </p>
    <p>
      At parting, Eliza said to the girl, "What do you think I heard somebody
      say about you? That it was enough to make anybody's eyes start square out
      of their head to look at such red cheeks as yours." Whereupon the girl
      turned off the compliment with a laugh, and took her leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an old blind dog, recognizing his friends by the sense of smell.
      I observe the eager awkwardness with which he accomplishes the
      recognition, his carefulness in descending steps, and generally in his
      locomotion. He evidently has not forgotten that he once had the faculty of
      sight; for he turns his eyes with earnestness towards those who attract
      his attention, though the orbs are plainly sightless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an Englishman,&mdash;a thorough-going Tory and Monarchist,&mdash;upholding
      everything English, government, people, habits, education, manufactures,
      modes of living, and expressing his dislike of all Americanisms,&mdash;and
      this in a quiet, calm, reasonable way, as if it were quite proper to live
      in a country and draw his subsistence from it, and openly abuse it. He
      imports his clothes from England, and expatiates on the superiority of
      English boots, hats, cravats, etc. He is a man of unmalleable habits, and
      wears his dress of the same fashion as that of twenty years ago.

      August 18th.&mdash;There has come one of the proprietors, or
      superintendents, of a caravan of animals,&mdash;a large, portly paunched,
      dark-complexioned, brandy-burnt, heavy-faced man of about fifty; with a
      diminutive nose in proportion to the size of his face,&mdash;thick lips;
      nevertheless he has the air of a man who has seen much, and derived such
      experience as was for his purpose. Also it is the air of a man not in a
      subordinate station, though vulgar and coarse. He arrived in a wagon, with
      a span of handsome gray horses, and ordered dinner. He had left his
      caravan at Worcester, and came from thence and over the mountain hither,
      to settle stopping-places for the caravan. The nearest place to this. I
      believe, was Charlemont; the penultimate at Greenfield. In stopping at
      such a village as this, they do not expect much profit, if any; but would
      be content with enough to pay their travelling expenses, while they look
      to gather gain at larger places. In this village, it seems, the selectmen
      had resolved not to license any public exhibition of the kind; and it was
      interesting to attend to the consultations whether it were feasible to
      overcome the objections, and what might be the best means. Orrin S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      and the chance passers-by took part in the discussion. The scruple is that
      the factory-girls, having ready money by them, spend it for these
      nonsenses, quitting their work; whereas, were it a mere farming-town, the
      caravan would take little in proportion to their spendings. The opinion
      generally was that the license could not be obtained; and the portly man's
      face grew darker and downcast at the prospect; and he took out a
      travelling-map, and looked it carefully over, to discover some other
      station. This is something like the planning of the march of an army. It
      was finally resolved to enlist the influence of a brother-in-law of the
      head selectman, and try to gain his consent. Whereupon the caravan-man and
      the brother-in-law (who, being a tavern-keeper, was to divide the custom
      of the caravan people with this house) went to make the attempt,&mdash;the
      caravan-man stalking along with stiff, awkward bulk and stature, yet
      preserving a respectability withal, though with somewhat of the
      blackguard. Before he went, he offered a wager of "a drink of rum to a
      thaw of tobacco" that he did not succeed. When he came back, there was a
      flush in his face and a sparkle in his eye that did not look like failure;
      but I know not what was the result. He took a glass of wine with the
      brother-in-law,&mdash;a grave, thin, frosty-haired, shrewd-looking yeoman,
      in his shirt-sleeves,&mdash;then ordered his horses, paid his bill, and
      drove off, accompanied still by the same yeoman, perhaps to get the
      permission of the other two selectmen. If he does not get a license here,
      he will try at Cheshire.

      August 19th.&mdash;I drove with Orrin S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; last evening
      to an old farmer's house to get some chickens. Entering the kitchen, I
      observed a fireplace with rough stone jambs and back, and a marble hearth,
      cracked, and otherwise contrasting a roughness of workmanship with the
      value of the material. There was a clock without a case, the weights being
      visible, and the pendulum swinging in air,&mdash;and a coffee-mill fixed
      against the wall. A religious newspaper lay on the mantel-piece. The old
      farmer was reluctant to go after the fowls, declaring that it would be
      impossible to find them in the dark; but Orrin insisting, he lighted a
      lamp, and we all went together, and quickly found them, roosted about the
      wood-pile; whereupon Orrin speedily laid hands on five, and wrung their
      necks in a twinkling, they fluttering long after they should have been
      dead. When we had taken our departure, Orrin remarked, "How faint-hearted
      these old fellows are!" and it was a good observation; for it was the
      farmer's timorous age that made him doubt the practicability of catching
      the chickens, and it contrasted well with the persevering energy of the
      middle-aged Orrin. But Orrin inquired, somewhat dolefully, whether I
      should suppose that he himself bewailed the advances of age. It is a
      grievous point with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening there was a strange fellow in the bar-room,&mdash;a sort of
      mock Methodist,&mdash;a cattle-drover, who had stopped here for the night
      with two cows and a Durham bull. All his talk turned upon religion, and he
      would ever and anon burst out in some strain of scriptural-styled
      eloquence, chanted through his nose, like an exhortation at a
      camp-meeting. A group of Universalists and no-religionists sat around him,
      making him their butt, and holding wild argument with him; and he
      strangely mingled humor with his enthusiasm, and enthusiasm with his
      humor, so that it was almost impossible to tell whether he were in jest or
      earnest. Probably it was neither, but an eccentricity, an almost
      monomania, that has grown upon him,&mdash;perhaps the result of strong
      religious excitement. And, having been a backslider, he is cursed with a
      half-frenzied humor. In the morning he talked in the same strain at
      breakfast, while quaffing fourteen cups of tea,&mdash;Eliza, all the
      while, as she supplied him, entreating him not to drink any more. After
      breakfast (it being the Sabbath) he drove his two cows and bull past the
      stoop, raising his stair, and running after them with strange, uncouth
      gestures; and the last word I heard from him was an exhortation:
      "Gentlemen, now all of you take your Bibles, and meditate on divine
      things,"&mdash;this being uttered with raised hands, and a Methodistical
      tone, intermingled, as was his expression, with something humorous; so
      that, to the last, the puzzle was still kept up, whether he was an
      enthusiast or a jester. He wore a suit of coarse brown cloth, cut in
      rather a Quaker fashion; and he had a large nose, and his face expressed
      enthusiasm and honor,&mdash;a sort of smile and twinkle of the eye, with
      wildness. He is excellent at a bargain; and if, in the midst of his
      ghostly exhortation, the talk were turned on cattle, he eagerly seized the
      topic and expatiated on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this fellow was enumerating the Universalists in neighboring towns
      who had turned from their errors on their death-beds, some one exclaimed,
      "John Hodges! why, he isn't dead,&mdash;he's alive and well." Whereat
      there was a roar of laughter. While holding an argument at table, I heard
      him mutter to himself at something that his adversary said; and though I
      could not distinguish what it was, the tone did more to convince me of
      some degree of earnestness than aught beside. This character might be
      wrought into a strange portrait of something sad, terrific, and laughable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sabbath wore away lazily, and therefore wickedly. The heavy
      caravan-man inquired for some book of light reading, and, having obtained
      an old volume of a literary paper, betook himself to the seat of his
      wagon, to read. At other times he smoked, and talked sensibly enough with
      anybody that offered. He is a man of sense, though not quick, and seems to
      be a fair man.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he walks, he puts the thumb of each hand into the armhole of his
      waistcoat, and moves along stiffly, with a knock-kneed gait. His talk was
      chiefly of hotels, and such matters as a man, always travelling, without
      any purpose of observation for mental improvement, would be interested in.
      He spoke of his life as a hard one.
    </p>

      There was a Methodist quarterly meeting here, and a love-feast.

      There is a fellow hereabout who refuses to pay six dollars for the coffin
      in which his wife was buried. She died about six months since, and I
      believe he is already engaged to another. He is young and rather comely,
      but has not a straightforward look.

      One man plods along, looking always on the ground, without ever lifting
      his eyes to the mountain scenery, and forest, and clouds, above and around
      him. Another walks the street with a quick, prying eye, and sharp face,&mdash;the
      most, expressive possible of one on the lookout for gain,&mdash;of the
      most disagreeable class of Yankees. There is also a sour-looking,
      unwholesome boy, the son of this man, whose voice is querulous and
      ill-natured, precisely suited to his aspect. So is his character.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have another with Indian blood in him, and the straight, black hair,&mdash;
      something of the tawny skin and the quick, shining eye of the Indian. He
      seems reserved, but is not ill-natured when spoken to. There is so much of
      the white in him, that he gives the impression of belonging to a civilized
      race, which causes the more strange sensation on discovering that he has a
      wild lineage.
    </p>
    <p>
      August 22d.&mdash;I walked out into what is called the Notch this
      forenoon, between Saddle Mountain and another. There are good farms in
      this Notch, although the ground is considerably elevated,&mdash;this
      morning, indeed, above the clouds; for I penetrated through one in
      reaching the higher region, although I found sunshine there. Graylock was
      hidden in clouds, and the rest of Saddle Mountain had one partially
      wreathed about it; but it was withdrawn before long. It was very beautiful
      cloud-scenery. The clouds lay on the breast of the mountain, dense, white,
      well-defined, and some of them were in such close vicinity that it seemed
      as if I could infold myself in them; while others, belonging to the same
      fleet, were floating through the blue sky above. I had a view of
      Williamstown at the distance of a few miles,&mdash;two or three, perhaps,&mdash;a
      white village and steeple in a gradual hollow, with high mountainous
      swells heaving themselves up, like immense, subsiding waves, far and wide
      around it. On these high mountain-waves rested the white summer clouds, or
      they rested as still in the air above; and they were formed in such
      fantastic shapes that they gave the strongest possible impression of being
      confounded or intermixed with the sky. It was like a day-dream to look at
      it; and the students ought to be day-dreamers, all of them,&mdash;when
      cloud-land is one and the same thing with the substantial earth. By
      degrees all these clouds flitted away, and the sultry summer sun burned on
      hill and valley. As I was walking home, an old man came down the
      mountain-path behind me in a wagon, and gave me a drive to the village.
      Visitors being few in the Notch, the women and girls looked from the
      windows after me; the men nodded and greeted me with a look of curiosity;
      and two little girls whom I met, bearing tin pails, whispered one another
      and smiled.

      North Adams, August 23d.&mdash;The county commissioners held a court; in
      the bar-room yesterday afternoon, for the purpose of letting out the
      making of the new road over the mountain. The commissioners sat together
      in attitudes of some dignity, with one leg laid across another; and the
      people, to the number of twenty or thirty, sat round about with their hats
      on, in their shirt-sleeves, with but little, yet with some formality.
      Several had come from a distance to bid for the job. They sat with whips
      in their hands. The first bid was three dollars,&mdash;then there was a
      long silence,&mdash;then a bid of two dollars eighty-five cents, and
      finally it was knocked down at two eighteen, per rod. A disposition to bid
      was evidenced in one man by his joking on the bid of another.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper, as the sun was setting, a man passed by the door with a
      hand-organ, connected with which was a row of figures, such as dancers,
      pirouetting and turning, a lady playing on a piano, soldiers, a negro
      wench dancing, and opening and shutting a huge red mouth,&mdash;all these
      keeping time to the lively or slow tunes of the organ. The man had a
      pleasant, but sly, dark face; he carried his whole establishment on his
      shoulder, it being fastened to a staff which he rested on the ground when
      he performed. A little crowd of people gathered about him on the stoop,
      peeping over each other's heads with huge admiration,&mdash;fat Otis
      Hodge, and the tall stage-driver, and the little boys, all declaring that
      it was the masterpiece of sights. Some few coppers did the man obtain, as
      well as much praise. He had come over the high, solitary mountain, where
      for miles there could hardly be a soul to hear his music.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, a portly old commissioner, a cheerful man enough, was
      sitting reading the newspaper in the parlor, holding the candle between
      the newspaper and his eyes,&mdash;its rays glittering on his silver-bowed
      spectacles and silvery hair. A pensive mood of age had come upon him, and
      sometimes he heaved a long sigh, while he turned and re-turned the paper,
      and folded it for convenient reading. By and by a gentleman came to see
      him, and he talked with him cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fat old squire, whom I have mentioned more than once, is an odd
      figure, with his bluff, red face,&mdash;coarsely red,&mdash;set in silver
      hair,&mdash; his clumsy legs, which he moves in a strange straddle, using,
      I believe, a broomstick for a staff. The breadth of back of these fat men
      is truly a wonder.
    </p>

      A decent man, at table the other day, took the only remaining potato out
      of the dish, on the end of his knife, and offered his friend half of it!

      The mountains look much larger and more majestic sometimes than at others,&mdash;partly
      because the mind may be variously disposed, so as to comprehend them more
      or less, and partly that an imperceptible (or almost so) haze adds a great
      deal to the effect. Saddleback often looks a huge, black mass,&mdash;black-green,
      or black-blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cave makes a fresh impression upon me every time I visit it,&mdash;so
      deep, so irregular, so gloomy, so stern,&mdash;part of its walls the pure
      white of the marble,&mdash;others covered with a gray decomposition and
      with spots of moss, and with brake growing where there is a handful of
      earth. I stand and look into its depths at various points, and hear the
      roar of the stream re-echoing up. It is like a heart that has been rent
      asunder by a torrent of passion, which has raged and foamed, and left its
      ineffaceable traces; though now there is but a little rill of feeling at
      the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      In parts, trees have fallen across the fissure,&mdash;trees with large
      trunks.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bathed in the stream in this old, secluded spot, which I frequent for
      that purpose. To reach it, I cross one branch of the stream on stones, and
      then pass to the other side of a little island, overgrown with trees and
      underbrush. Where I bathe, the stream has partially dammed itself up by
      sweeping together tree-trunks and slabs and branches, and a thousand
      things that have come down its current for years perhaps; so that there is
      a deep pool, full of eddies and little whirlpools which would carry me
      away, did I not take hold of the stem of a small tree that lies
      opportunely transversely across the water. The bottom is uneven, with
      rocks of various size, against which it is difficult to keep from
      stumbling, so rapid is the stream. Sometimes it bears along branches and
      strips of bark,&mdash;sometimes a green leaf, or perchance a dry one,&mdash;
      occasionally overwhelmed by the eddies and borne deep under water, then
      rushing atop the waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The forest, bordering the stream, produces its effect by a complexity of
      causes,&mdash;the old and stern trees, with stately trunks and dark
      foliage,&mdash; as the almost black pines,&mdash;the young trees, with
      lightsome green foliage,&mdash;as sapling oaks, maples and poplars,&mdash;then
      the old, decayed trunks, that are seen lying here and there, all
      mouldered, so that the foot would sink into them. The sunshine, falling
      capriciously on a casual branch considerably within the forest verge,
      while it leaves nearer trees in shadow, leads the imagination into the
      depths. But it soon becomes bewildered there. Rocks strewn about, half
      hidden in the fallen leaves, must not be overlooked.
    </p>
    <p>
      August 26th.&mdash;A funeral last evening, nearly at sunset,&mdash;a
      coffin of a boy about ten years old laid on a one-horse wagon among some
      straw,&mdash;two or three barouches and wagons following. As the funeral
      passed through the village street, a few men formed a short procession in
      front of the coffin, among whom were Orrin S&mdash;&mdash;- and I. The
      burial-ground (there are two in the town) is on the sides and summit of a
      round hill, which is planted with cypress and other trees, among which the
      white marble gravestones show pleasantly. The grave was dug on the steep
      slope of a hill; and the grave-digger was waiting there, and two or three
      other shirt-sleeved yeomen, leaning against the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orrin S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, a wanton and mirth-making middle-aged man,
      who would not seem to have much domestic feeling, took a chief part on the
      occasion, assisting in taking the coffin from the wagon and in lowering it
      into the grave. There being some superfluous earth at the bottom of the
      grave, the coffin was drawn up again after being once buried, and the
      obstacle removed with a hoe; then it was lowered again for the last time.
      While this was going on, the father and mother stood weeping at the upper
      end of the grave, at the head of the little procession,&mdash;the mother
      sobbing with stifled violence, and peeping forth to discover why the
      coffin was drawn up again. It being fitted in its place, Orrin S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      strewed some straw upon it,&mdash;this being the custom here, because "the
      clods on the coffin-lid have an ugly sound." Then the Baptist minister,
      having first whispered to the father, removed his hat, the spectators all
      doing the same, and thanked them "in the name of these mourners, for this
      last act of kindness to them."
    </p>
    <p>
      In all these rites Orrin S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; bore the chief part with
      real feeling and sadly decorous demeanor. After the funeral, I took a walk
      on the Williamstown road, towards the west. There had been a heavy shower
      in the afternoon, and clouds were brilliant all over the sky, around
      Graylock and everywhere else. Those over the hills of the west were the
      most splendid in purple and gold, and, there being a haze, it added
      immensely to their majesty and dusky magnificence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This morning I walked a little way along the mountain road, and stood
      awhile in the shadow of some oak and chestnut trees,&mdash;it being a
      warm, bright, sunshiny morning. The shades lay long from trees and other
      objects, as at sunset, but how different this cheerful and light radiance
      from the mild repose of sunset! Locusts, crickets, and other insects were
      making music. Cattle were feeding briskly, with morning appetites. The
      wakeful voices of children were heard in a neighboring hollow. The dew
      damped the road, and formed many-colored drops in the grass. In short, the
      world was not weary with a long, sultry day, but in a fresh, recruited
      state, fit to carry it through such a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rough-looking, sunburnt, soiled-skirted, odd, middle-aged little man
      came to the house a day or two ago, seeking work. He had come from Ohio,
      and was returning to his native place, somewhere in New England, stopping
      occasionally to earn money to pay his way. There was something rather
      ludicrous in his physiognomy and aspect. He was very free to talk with all
      and sundry. He made a long eulogy on his dog Tiger, yesterday, insisting
      on his good moral character, his not being quarrelsome, his docility, and
      all other excellent qualities that a huge, strong, fierce mastiff could
      have. Tiger is the bully of the village, and keeps all the other dogs in
      awe. His aspect is very spirited, trotting massively along, with his tail
      elevated and his head likewise. "When he sees a dog that's anything near
      his size, he's apt to growl a little,"&mdash;Tiger had the marks of a
      battle on him,&mdash;"yet he's a good dog."
    </p>
    <p>
      Friday, August 31st.&mdash;A drive on Tuesday to Shelburne Falls,
      twenty-two miles or thereabouts distant. Started at about eight o'clock in
      a wagon with Mr. Leach and Mr. Birch. Our road lay over the Green
      Mountains, the long ridge of which was made awful by a dark, heavy,
      threatening cloud, apparently rolled and condensed along the whole summit.
      As we ascended the zigzag road, we looked behind, at every opening in the
      forest, and beheld a wide landscape of mountain-swells and valleys
      intermixed, and old Graylock and the whole of Saddleback. Over the wide
      scene there was a general gloom; but there was a continual vicissitude of
      bright sunshine flitting over it, now resting for a brief space on
      portions of the heights, now flooding the valleys with green brightness,
      now making out distinctly each dwelling, and the hotels, and then two
      small brick churches of the distant village, denoting its prosperity,
      while all around seemed under adverse fortunes. But we, who stood so
      elevated above mortal things, and saw so wide and far, could see the
      sunshine of prosperity departing from one spot and rolling towards
      another, so that we could not think it much matter which spot were sunny
      or gloomy at any one moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The top of this Hoosic Mountain is a long ridge, marked on the county map
      as two thousand one hundred and sixty feet above the sea; on this summit
      is a valley, not very deep, but one or two miles wide, in which is the
      town of L&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. Here there are respectable farmers, though
      it is a rough, and must be a bleak place. The first house, after reaching
      the summit, is a small, homely tavern. We left our horse in the shed, and,
      entering the little unpainted bar-room, we heard a voice, in a strange,
      outlandish accent, exclaiming "Diorama." It was an old man, with a full,
      gray-bearded countenance, and Mr. Leach exclaimed, "Ah, here's the old
      Dutchman again!" And he answered, "Yes, Captain, here's the old Dutchman,"&mdash;though,
      by the way, he is a German, and travels the country with this diorama in a
      wagon, and had recently been at South Adams, and was now returning from
      Saratoga Springs. We looked through the glass orifice of his machine,
      while he exhibited a succession of the very worst scratches and daubings
      that can be imagined,&mdash;worn out, too, and full of cracks and
      wrinkles, dimmed with tobacco-smoke, and every other wise dilapidated.
      There were none in a later fashion than thirty years since, except some
      figures that had been cut from tailors' show-bills. There were views of
      cities and edifices in Europe, of Napoleon's battles and Nelson's
      sea-fights, in the midst of which would be seen a gigantic, brown, hairy
      hand (the Hand of Destiny) pointing at the principal points of the
      conflict, while the old Dutchman explained. He gave a good deal of
      dramatic effect to his descriptions, but his accent and intonation cannot
      be written. He seemed to take interest and pride in his exhibition; yet
      when the utter and ludicrous miserability thereof made us laugh, he joined
      in the joke very readily. When the last picture had been shown, he caused
      a country boor, who stood gaping beside the machine, to put his head
      within it, and thrust out his tongue. The head becoming gigantic, a
      singular effect was produced.

      The old Dutchman's exhibition being over, a great dog, apparently an
      elderly dog, suddenly made himself the object of notice, evidently in
      rivalship of the Dutchman. He had seemed to be a good-natured, quiet kind
      of dog, offering his head to be patted by those who were kindly disposed
      towards him. This great, old dog, unexpectedly, and of his own motion,
      began to run round after his not very long tail with the utmost eagerness;
      and, catching hold of it, he growled furiously at it, and still continued
      to circle round, growling and snarling with increasing rage, as if one
      half of his body were at deadly enmity with the other. Faster and faster
      went he, round and roundabout, growing still fiercer, till at last he
      ceased in a state of utter exhaustion; but no sooner had his exhibition
      finished than he became the same mild, quiet, sensible old dog as before;
      and no one could have suspected him of such nonsense as getting enraged
      with his own tail. He was first taught this trick by attaching a bell to
      the end of his tail; but he now commences entirely of his own accord, and
      I really believe he feels vain at the attention he excites.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was chill and bleak on the mountain-top, and a fire was burning in the
      bar-room. The old Dutchman bestowed on everybody the title of "Captain,"
      perhaps because such a title has a great chance of suiting an American.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the tavern, we drove a mile or two farther to the eastern brow of
      the mountain, whence we had a view, over the tops of a multitude of
      heights, into the intersecting valleys down which we were to plunge,&mdash;and
      beyond them the blue and indistinctive scene extended to the east and
      north for at least sixty miles. Beyond the hills it looked almost as if
      the blue ocean might be seen. Monadnock was visible, like a sapphire cloud
      against the sky. Descending, we by and by got a view of the Deerfield
      River, which makes a bend in its course from about north and south to
      about east and west, coming out from one defile among the mountains, and
      flowing through another. The scenery on the eastern side of the Green
      Mountains is incomparably more striking than on the western, where the
      long swells and ridges have a flatness of effect; and even Graylock heaves
      itself so gradually that it does not much strike the beholder. But on the
      eastern part, peaks one or two thousand feet high rush up on either bank
      of the river in ranges, thrusting out their shoulders side by side. They
      are almost precipitous, clothed in woods, through which the naked rock
      pushes itself forth to view. Sometimes the peak is bald, while the forest
      wraps the body of the hill, and the baldness gives it an indescribably
      stern effect. Sometimes the precipice rises with abruptness from the
      immediate side of the river; sometimes there is a cultivated valley on
      either side,&mdash;cultivated long, and with all the smoothness and
      antique rurality of a farm near cities,&mdash;this gentle picture strongly
      set off by the wild mountain-frame around it. Often it would seem a wonder
      how our road was to continue, the mountains rose so abruptly on either
      side, and stood, so direct a wall, across our onward course; while,
      looking behind, it would be an equal mystery how we had gotten thither,
      through the huge base of the mountain, that seemed to have reared itself
      erect after our passage. But, passing onward, a narrow defile would give
      us egress into a scene where new mountains would still appear to bar us.
      Our road was much of it level; but scooped out among mountains. The river
      was a brawling stream, shallow, and roughened by rocks; now we drove on a
      plane with it; now there was a sheer descent down from the roadside upon
      it, often unguarded by any kind of fence, except by the trees that
      contrived to grow on the headlong interval. Between the mountains there
      were gorges, that led the imagination away into new scenes of wildness. I
      have never driven through such romantic scenery, where there was such
      variety and boldness of mountain shapes as this; and though it was a broad
      sunny day, the mountains diversified the view with sunshine and shadow,
      and glory and gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Charlemont (I think), after passing a bridge, we saw a very curious
      rock on the shore of the river, about twenty feet from the roadside.
      Clambering down the bank, we found it a complete arch, hollowed out of the
      solid rock, and as high as the arched entrance of an ancient church, which
      it might be taken to be, though considerably dilapidated and weather-worn.
      The water flows through it, though the rock afforded standing room, beside
      the pillars. It was really like the archway of an enchanted palace, all of
      which has vanished except the entrance,&mdash;now only into nothingness
      and empty space. We climbed to the top of the arch, in which the traces of
      water having eddied are very perceptible. This curiosity occurs in a wild
      part of the river's course, and in a solitude of mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farther down, the river becoming deeper, broader, and more placid, little
      boats were seen moored along it, for the convenience of crossing.
      Sometimes, too, the well-beaten track of wheels and hoofs passed down to
      its verge, then vanished, and appeared on the other side, indicating a
      ford. We saw one house, pretty, small, with green blinds, and much
      quietness in its environments, on the other side of the river, with a
      flat-bottomed boat for communication. It was a pleasant idea that the
      world was kept off by the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proceeding onward, we reached Shelburne Falls. Here the river, in the
      distance of a few hundred yards, makes a descent of about a hundred and
      fifty feet over a prodigious bed of rock. Formerly it doubtless flowed
      unbroken over the rock, merely creating a rapid; and traces of water
      having raged over it are visible in portions of the rock that now lie high
      and dry. At present the river roars through a channel which it has worn in
      the stone, leaping in two or three distinct falls, and rushing downward,
      as from flight to flight of a broken and irregular staircase. The mist
      rises from the highest of these cataracts, and forms a pleasant object in
      the sunshine. The best view, I think, is to stand on the verge of the
      upper and largest fall, and look down through the whole rapid descent of
      the river, as it hurries, foaming, through its rock-worn path,&mdash;the
      rocks seeming to have been hewn away, as when mortals make a road. These
      falls are the largest in this State, and have a very peculiar character.
      It seems as if water had had more power at some former period than now, to
      hew and tear its passage through such an immense ledge of rock as here
      withstood it. In this crag, or parts of it, now far beyond the reach of
      the water, it has worn what are called pot-holes,&mdash;being circular
      hollows in the rock, where for ages stones have been whirled round and
      round by the eddies of the water; so that the interior of the pot is as
      circular and as smooth as it could have been made by art. Often the mouth
      of the pot is the narrowest part, the inner space being deeply scooped
      out. Water is contained in most of these pot-holes, sometimes so deep that
      a man might drown himself therein, and lie undetected at the bottom. Some
      of them are of a convenient size for cooking, which might be practicable
      by putting in hot stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tavern at Shelburne Falls was about the worst I ever saw,&mdash;there
      being hardly anything to eat, at least nothing of the meat kind. There was
      a party of students from the Rensselaer school at Troy, who had spent the
      night there, a set of rough urchins from sixteen to twenty years old,
      accompanied by the wagon-driver, a short, stubbed little fellow, who
      walked about with great independence, thrusting his hands into his
      breeches-pockets, beneath his frock. The queerness was, such a figure
      being associated with classic youth. They were on an excursion which is
      yearly made from that school in search of minerals. They seemed in rather
      better moral habits than students used to be, but wild-spirited, rude, and
      unpolished, somewhat like German students, which resemblance one or two of
      them increased by smoking pipes. In the morning, my breakfast being set in
      a corner of the same room with them, I saw their breakfast-table, with a
      huge wash-bowl of milk in the centre, and a basin and spoon placed for
      each guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the bar-room of this tavern were posted up written advertisements, the
      smoked chimney-piece being thus made to serve for a newspaper: "I have rye
      for sale," "I have a fine mare colt," etc. There was one quaintly
      expressed advertisement of a horse that had strayed or been stolen from a
      pasture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The students, from year to year, have been in search of a particular rock,
      somewhere on the mountains in the vicinity of Shelburne Falls, which is
      supposed to contain some valuable ore; but they cannot find it. One man in
      the bar-room observed that it must be enchanted; and spoke of a tinker,
      during the Revolutionary War, who met with a somewhat similar instance.
      Roaming along the Hudson River, he came to a precipice which had some
      bunches of singular appearance embossed upon it. He knocked off one of the
      hunches, and carrying it home, or to a camp, or wherever he lived, he put
      it on the fire, and incited it down into clear lead. He sought for the
      spot again and again, but could never find it.
    </p>

      Mr. Leach's brother is a student at Shelburne Falls. He is about
      thirty-five years old, and married; and at this mature age he is studying
      for the ministry, and will not finish his course for two or three years.
      He was bred a farmer, but has sold his farm, and invested the money, and
      supports himself and wife by dentistry during his studies. Many of the
      academy students are men grown, and some, they say, well towards forty
      years old. Methinks this is characteristic of American life,&mdash;these
      rough, weather-beaten, hard-handed, farmer-bred students. In nine cases
      out of ten they are incapable of any effectual cultivation; for men of
      ripe years, if they have any pith in them, will have long ago got beyond
      academy or even college instruction. I suspect nothing better than a very
      wretched smattering is to be obtained in these country academies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jerkins, an instructor at Amherst, speaking of the Western mounds,
      expressed an opinion that they were of the same nature and origin as some
      small circular hills which are of very frequent occurrence here in North
      Adams. The burial-ground is on one of them, and there is another, on the
      summit of which appears a single tombstone, as if there were something
      natural in making these hills the repositories of the dead. A question of
      old H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; led to Mr. Jenkins's dissertation on this
      subject, to the great contentment of a large circle round the bar-room
      fireside on the last rainy day.

      A tailor is detected by Mr. Leach, because his coat had not a single
      wrinkle in it. I saw him exhibiting patterns of fashions to Randall, the
      village tailor. Mr. Leach has much tact in finding out the professions of
      people. He found out a blacksmith, because his right hand was much larger
      than the other.

      A man getting subscriptions for a religious and abolition newspaper in New
      York,&mdash;somewhat elderly and gray-haired, quick in his movements,
      hasty in his walk, with an eager, earnest stare through his spectacles,
      hurrying about with a pocket-book of subscriptions in his hand,&mdash;seldom
      speaking, and then in brief expressions,&mdash;sitting down before the
      stage comes, to write a list of subscribers obtained to his employers in
      New York. Withal, a city and business air about him, as of one accustomed
      to hurry through narrow alleys, and dart across thronged streets, and
      speak hastily to one man and another at jostling corners, though now
      transacting his affairs in the solitude of mountains.

      An old, gray man, seemingly astray and abandoned in this wide world,
      sitting in the bar-room, speaking to none, nor addressed by any one. Not
      understanding the meaning of the supper-bell till asked to supper by word
      of mouth. However, he called for a glass of brandy.

      A pedler, with girls' silk neckerchiefs,&mdash;or gauze,&mdash;men's silk
      pocket-handkerchiefs, red bandannas, and a variety of horn combs, trying
      to trade with the servant-girls of the house. One of them, Laura, attempts
      to exchange a worked vandyke, which she values at two dollars and a half;
      Eliza, being reproached by the pedler, "vows that she buys more of pedlers
      than any other person in the house."

      A drove of pigs passing at dusk. They appeared not so much disposed to
      ramble and go astray from the line of march as in daylight, but kept
      together in a pretty compact body. There was a general grunting, not
      violent at all, but low and quiet, as if they were expressing their
      sentiments among themselves in a companionable way. Pigs, on a march, do
      not subject themselves to any leader among themselves, but pass on,
      higgledy-piggledy, without regard to age or sex.

      September 1st.&mdash;Last evening, during a walk, Graylock and the whole
      of Saddleback were at first imbued with a mild, half-sunshiny tinge, then
      grew almost black,&mdash;a huge, dark mass lying on the back of the earth
      and encumbering it. Stretching up from behind the black mountain, over a
      third or more of the sky, there was a heavy, sombre blue heap or ledge of
      clouds, looking almost as solid as rocks. The volumes of which it was
      composed were perceptible, by translucent lines and fissures; but the
      mass, as a whole, seemed as solid, bulky, and ponderous in the cloud-world
      as the mountain was on earth. The mountain and cloud together had an
      indescribably stern and majestic aspect. Beneath this heavy cloud, there
      was a fleet or flock of light, vapory mists, flitting in middle air; and
      these were tinted, from the vanished sun, with the most gorgeous and
      living purple that can be conceived,&mdash;a fringe upon the stern blue.
      In the opposite quarter of the heavens, a rose-light was reflected, whence
      I know not, which colored the clouds around the moon, then well above the
      horizon, so that the nearly round and silver moon appeared strangely among
      roseate clouds,&mdash;sometimes half obscured by them.

      A man with a smart horse, upon which the landlord makes laudatory remarks.
      He replies that he has "a better at home." Dressed in a brown,
      bright-buttoned coat, smartly cut. He immediately becomes familiar, and
      begins to talk of the license law, and other similar topics,&mdash;making
      himself at home, as one who, being much of his time upon the road, finds
      himself at ease at any tavern. He inquired after a stage agent, named
      Brigham, who formerly resided here, but now has gone to the West. He
      himself was probably a horse-jockey.

      An old lady, stopping here over the Sabbath, waiting for to-morrow's stage

      the society of the women of the house.

      September 3d.&mdash;On the slope of Bald Mountain a clearing, set in the
      frame of the forest on all sides,&mdash;a growth of clover upon it, which,
      having been mowed once this year, is now appropriated to pasturage. Stumps
      remaining in the ground; one tall, barkless stem of a tree standing
      upright, branchless, and with a shattered summit. One or two other stems
      lying prostrate and partly overgrown with bushes and shrubbery, some of
      them bearing a yellow flower,&mdash;a color which Autumn loves. The stumps
      and trunks fire-blackened, yet nothing about them that indicates a recent
      clearing, but the roughness of an old clearing, that, being removed from
      convenient labor, has none of the polish of the homestead. The field, with
      slight undulations, slopes pretty directly down. Near the lower verge, a
      rude sort of barn, or rather haystack roofed over, and with hay protruding
      and hanging out. An ox feeding, and putting up his muzzle to pull down a
      mouthful of hay; but seeing me, a stranger, in the upper part of the
      field, he remains long gazing, and finally betakes himself to feeding
      again. A solitary butterfly flitting to and fro, blown slightly on its
      course by a cool September wind,&mdash;the coolness of which begins to be
      tempered by a bright, glittering sun. There is dew on the grass. In front,
      beyond the lower spread of forest, Saddle Mountain rises, and the valleys
      and long, swelling hills sweep away. But the impression of this clearing
      is solitude, as of a forgotten land.

      It is customary here to toll the bell at the death of a person, at the

      "There are three times in a man's life when he is talked about,&mdash;when

      pocket." (In reference to a claim by the guests of the bar-room on the man
      Amasa Richardson for a treat.)

      A wood-chopper, travelling the country in search of jobs at chopping. His
      baggage a bundle, a handkerchief, and a pair of coarse boots. His
      implement an axe, most keenly ground and sharpened, which I had noticed
      standing in a corner, and thought it would almost serve as a razor. I saw
      another wood-chopper sitting down on the ascent of Bald Mountain, with his
      axe on one side and a jug and provisions on the other, on the way to his
      day's toil.

      The Revolutionary pensioners come out into the sunshine to make oath that
      they are still above ground. One, whom Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; saluted
      as "Uncle John," went into the bar-room, walking pretty stoutly by the aid
      of a long, oaken staff,&mdash;with an old, creased, broken and ashen
      bell-crowned hat on his head, and wearing a brown old-fashioned suit of
      clothes. Pretty portly, fleshy in the face, and with somewhat of a paunch,
      cheerful, and his senses, bodily and mental, in no very bad order, though
      he is now in his ninetieth year. "An old man's withered and wilted apple,"
      quoth Uncle John, "keeps a good while." Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; says
      his grandfather lived to be a hundred, and that his legs became covered
      with moss, like the trunk of an old tree. Uncle John would smile and
      cackle at a little jest, and what life there was in him seemed a
      good-natured and comfortable one enough. He can walk two or three miles,
      he says, "taking it moderate." I suppose his state is that of a drowsy man
      but partly conscious of life,&mdash;walking as through a dim dream, but
      brighter at some seasons than at others. By and by he will fall quite
      asleep, without any trouble. Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, unbidden, gave
      him a glass of gin, which the old man imbibed by the warm fireside, and
      grew the younger for it.

      September 4th.&mdash;This day an exhibition of animals in the vicinity of
      the village, under a pavilion of sail-cloth,&mdash;the floor being the
      natural grass, with here and there a rock partially protruding. A
      pleasant, mild shade; a strip of sunshine or a spot of glimmering
      brightness in some parts. Crowded,&mdash;row above row of women, on an
      amphitheatre of seats, on one side. In an inner pavilion an exhibition of
      anacondas,&mdash;four,&mdash;which the showman took, one by one, from a
      large box, under some blankets, and hung round his shoulders. They seemed
      almost torpid when first taken out, but gradually began to assume life, to
      stretch, to contract, twine and writhe about his neck and person,
      thrusting out their tongues and erecting their heads. Their weight was as
      much as he could bear, and they hung down almost to the ground when not
      contorted,&mdash;as big round as a thigh, almost,&mdash;spotted and richly
      variegated. Then he put them into the box again, their heads emerging and
      writhing forth, which the showman thrust back again. He gave a descriptive
      and historical account of them, and a fanciful and poetical one also. A
      man put his arm and head into the lion's mouth,&mdash;all the spectators
      looking on so attentively that a breath could not be heard. That was
      impressive,&mdash;its effect on a thousand persons,&mdash;more so than the
      thing itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening the caravan people were at the tavern, talking of their
      troubles in coming over the mountain,&mdash;the overturn of a cage
      containing two leopards and a hyena. They are a rough, ignorant set of
      men, apparently incapable of taking any particular enjoyment from the life
      of variety and adventure which they lead. There was the man who put his
      head into the lion's mouth, and, I suppose, the man about whom the
      anacondas twined, talking about their suppers, and blustering for hot
      meat, and calling for something to drink, without anything of the wild
      dignity of men familiar with the nobility of nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      A character of a desperate young man, who employs high courage and strong
      faculties in this sort of dangers, and wastes his talents in wild riot,
      addressing the audience as a snake-man,&mdash;keeping the ring while the
      monkey rides the pony,&mdash;singing negro and other songs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The country boors were continually getting within the barriers, and
      venturing too near the cages. The great lion lay with his fore paws
      extended, and a calm, majestic, but awful countenance. He looked on the
      people as if he had seen many such concourses. The hyena was the most ugly
      and dangerous looking beast, full of spite, and on ill terms with all
      nature, looking a good deal like a hog with the devil in him, the ridge of
      hair along his back bristling. He was in the cage with a leopard and a
      panther, and the latter seemed continually on the point of laying his paw
      on the hyena, who snarled, and showed his teeth. It is strange, though, to
      see how these wild beasts acknowledge and practise a degree of mutual
      forbearance, and of obedience to man, with their wild nature yet in them.
      The great white bear seemed in distress from the heat, moving his head and
      body in a peculiar, fantastic way, and eagerly drinking water when given
      it. He was thin and lank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The caravan men were so sleepy, Orrin S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; says, that he
      could hardly wake them in the morning. They turned over on their faces to
      show him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming out of the caravansary, there were the mountains, in the quiet
      sunset, and many men drunk, swearing, and fighting. Shanties with liquor
      for sale.

      September 5th.&mdash;I took a walk of three miles from the village, which
      brought me into Vermont. The line runs athwart a bridge,&mdash;a rude
      bridge, which crosses a mountain stream. The stream runs deep at the
      bottom of a gorge, plashing downward, with rapids and pools, and bestrewn
      with large rocks, deep and shady, not to be reached by the sun except in
      its meridian, as well on account of the depth of the gorge as of the arch
      of wilderness trees above it. There was a stumpy clearing beyond the
      bridge, where some men were building a house. I went to them, and inquired
      if I were in Massachusetts or Vermont, and asked for some water. Whereupon
      they showed great hospitality, and the master-workman went to the spring,
      and brought delicious water in a tin basin, and produced another jug
      containing "new rum, and very good; and rum does nobody any harm if they
      make a good use of it," quoth he. I invited them to call on me at the
      hotel, if they should cone to the village within two or three days. Then I
      took my way back through the forest, for this is a by-road, and is, much

      at an unseen depth, along the roadside.

      My walk forth had been an almost continued ascent, and, returning, I had
      an excellent view of Graylock and the adjacent mountains, at such a
      distance that they were all brought into one group, and comprehended at
      one view, as belonging to the same company,&mdash;all mighty, with a
      mightier chief. As I drew nearer home, they separated, and the unity of
      effect was lost. The more distant then disappeared behind the nearer ones,
      and finally Graylock itself was lost behind the hill which immediately
      shuts in the village. There was a warm, autumnal haze, which, I think,
      seemed to throw the mountains farther off, and both to enlarge and soften
      them.

    <p>
      September 7th.&mdash;Mr. Leach and I took a walk by moonlight last
      evening, on the road that leads over the mountain. Remote from houses, far
      up on the hillside, we found a lime-kiln, burning near the road; and,
      approaching it, a watcher started from the ground, where he had been lying
      at his length. There are several of these lime-kilns in this vicinity.
      They are circular, built with stones, like a round tower, eighteen or
      twenty feet high, having a hillock heaped around in a great portion of
      their circumference, so that the marble may be brought and thrown in by
      cart-loads at the top. At the bottom there is a doorway, large enough to
      admit a man in a stooping posture. Thus an edifice of great solidity is
      constructed, which will endure for centuries, unless needless pains are
      taken to tear it down. There is one on the hillside, close to the village,
      wherein weeds grow at the bottom, and grass and shrubs too are rooted in
      the interstices of the stones, and its low doorway has a dungeon-like
      aspect, and we look down from the top as into a roofless tower. It
      apparently has not been used for many years, and the lime and
      weather-stained fragments of marble are scattered about.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the one we saw last night a hard-wood fire was burning merrily,
      beneath the superincumbent marble,&mdash;the kiln being heaped full; and
      shortly after we came, the man (a dark, black-bearded figure, in
      shirt-sleeves) opened the iron door, through the chinks of which the fire
      was gleaming, and thrust in huge logs of wood, and stirred the immense
      coals with a long pole, and showed us the glowing limestone,&mdash;the
      lower layer of it. The heat of the fire was powerful, at the distance of
      several yards from the open door. He talked very sensibly with us, being
      doubtless glad to have two visitors to vary his solitary night-watch; for
      it would not do for him to fall asleep, since the fire should be refreshed
      as often as every twenty minutes. We ascended the hillock to the top of
      the kiln, and the marble was red-hot, and burning with a bluish, lambent
      flame, quivering up, sometimes nearly a yard high, and resembling the
      flame of anthracite coal, only, the marble being in large fragments, the
      flame was higher. The kiln was perhaps six or eight feet across. Four
      hundred bushels of marble were then in a state of combustion. The expense
      of converting this quantity into lime is about fifty dollars, and it sells
      for twenty-five cents per bushel at the kiln. We asked the man whether he
      would run across the top of the intensely burning kiln, barefooted, for a
      thousand dollars; and he said he would for ten. He told us that the lime
      had been burning forty-eight hours, and would be finished in thirty-six
      more. He liked the business of watching it better by night than by day;
      because the days were often hot, but such a mild and beautiful night as
      the last was just right. Here a poet might make verses with moonlight in
      them, and a gleam of fierce firelight flickering through. It is a shame to
      use this brilliant, white, almost transparent marble in this way. A man
      said of it, the other day, that into some pieces of it, when polished, one
      could see a good distance; and he instanced a certain gravestone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visited the cave. A large portion of it, where water trickles and falls,
      is perfectly white. The walls present a specimen of how Nature packs the
      stone, crowding huge masses, as it were, into chinks and fissures, and
      here we see it in the perpendicular or horizontal layers, as Nature laid
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      September 9th.&mdash;A walk yesterday forenoon through the Notch, formed
      between Saddle Mountain and another adjacent one. This Notch is otherwise
      called the Bellowspipe, being a long and narrow valley, with a steep wall
      on either side. The walls are very high, and the fallen timbers lie
      strewed adown the precipitous descent. The valley gradually descends from
      the narrowest part of the Notch, and a stream of water flows through the
      midst of it, which, farther onward in its course, turns a mill. The valley
      is cultivated, there being two or three farm-houses towards the northern
      end, and extensive fields of grass beyond, where stand the hay-mows of
      last year, with the hay cut away regularly around their bases. All the
      more distant portion of the valley is lonesome in the extreme; and on the
      hither side of the narrowest part the land is uncultivated, partly
      overgrown with forest, partly used as sheep-pastures, for which purpose it
      is not nearly so barren as sheep-pastures usually are. On the right,
      facing southward, rises Graylock, all beshagged with forest, and with
      headlong precipices of rock appearing among the black pines. Southward
      there is a most extensive view of the valley, in which Saddleback and its
      companion mountains are crouched,&mdash;wide and far,&mdash;a broad, misty
      valley, fenced in by a mountain wall, and with villages scattered along
      it, and miles of forest, which appear but as patches scattered here and
      there upon the landscape. The descent from the Notch southward is much
      more abrupt than on the other side. A stream flows down through it; and
      along much of its course it has washed away all the earth from a ledge of
      rock, and then formed a descending pavement, smooth and regular, which the
      scanty flow of water scarcely suffices to moisten at this period, though a
      heavy rain, probably, would send down a torrent, raging, roaring, and
      foaming. I descended along the course of the stream, and sometimes on the
      rocky path of it, and, turning off towards the south village, followed a
      cattle-path till I came to a cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      A horse was standing saddled near the door, but I did not see the rider. I
      knocked, and an elderly woman, of very pleasing and intelligent aspect,
      came at the summons, and gave me directions how to get to the south
      village through an orchard and "across lots," which would bring me into
      the road near the Quaker meeting-house, with gravestones round it. While
      she talked, a young woman came into the pantry from the kitchen, with a
      dirty little brat, whose squalls I had heard all along; the reason of his
      outcry being that his mother was washing him,&mdash;a very unusual
      process, if I may judge by his looks. I asked the old lady for some water,
      and she gave me, I think, the most delicious I ever tasted. These
      mountaineers ought certainly to be temperance people; for their mountain
      springs supply them with a liquor of which the cities and the low
      countries can have no conception. Pure, fresh, almost sparkling,
      exhilarating,&mdash;such water as Adam and Eve drank.
    </p>
    <p>
      I passed the south village on a by-road, without entering it, and was
      taken up by the stage from Pittsfield a mile or two this side of it.
      Platt, the driver, a friend of mine, talked familiarly about many matters,
      intermixing his talk with remarks on his team and addresses to the beasts
      composing it, who were three mares, and a horse on the near wheel,&mdash;all
      bays. The horse he pronounced "a dreadful nice horse to go; but if he
      could shirk off the work upon the others, he would,"&mdash;which
      unfairness Platt corrected by timely strokes of the whip whenever the
      horse's traces were not tightened. One of the mares wished to go faster,
      hearing another horse tramp behind her; "and nothing made her so mad,"
      quoth Platt, "as to be held in when she wanted to go." The near leader
      started. "O the little devil," said he, "how skittish she is!" Another
      stumbled, and Platt bantered her thereupon. Then he told of foundering
      through snow-drifts in winter, and carrying the mail on his back&mdash;four
      miles from Bennington. And thus we jogged on, and got to "mine inn" just
      as the dinner-bell was ringing.

      Pig-drover, with two hundred pigs. They are much more easily driven on
      rainy days than on fair ones. One of his pigs, a large one, particularly
      troublesome as to running off the road towards every object, and leading
      the drove. Thirteen miles about a day's journey, in the course of which
      the drover has to travel about thirty.
    </p>
    <p>
      They have a dog, who runs to and fro indefatigably, barking at those who
      straggle on the flanks of the line of march, then scampering to the other
      side and barking there, and sometimes having quite an affair of barking
      and surly grunting with some refractory pig, who has found something to
      munch, and refuses to quit it. The pigs are fed on corn at their halts.
      The drove has some ultimate market, and individuals are peddled out on the
      march. Some die.

      Merino sheep (which are much raised in Berkshire) are good for hardly

    <p>
      The tavern-keeper in Stockbridge, an elderly bachelor,&mdash;a dusty,
      black-dressed, antiquated figure, with a white neckcloth setting off a
      dim, yellow complexion, looking like one of the old wax-figures of
      ministers in a corner of the New England Museum. He did not seem old, but
      like a middle-aged man, who had been preserved in some dark and cobwebby
      corner for a great while. He is asthmatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Connecticut, and also sometimes in Berkshire, the villages are situated
      on the most elevated ground that can be found, so that they are visible
      for miles around. Litchfield is a remarkable instance, occupying a high
      plain, without the least shelter from the winds, and with almost as wide
      an expanse of view as from a mountain-top. The streets are very wide,&mdash;two
      or three hundred feet, at least,&mdash;with wide, green margins, and
      sometimes there is a wide green space between two road tracks. Nothing can
      be neater than the churches and houses. The graveyard is on the slope, and
      at the foot of a swell, filled with old and new gravestones, some of red
      freestone, some of gray granite, most of them of white marble, and one of
      cast-iron with an inscription of raised letters. There was one of the date
      of about 1776, on which was represented the third-length, has-relief
      portrait of a gentleman in a wig and other costume of that day; and as a
      framework about this portrait was wreathed a garland of vine-leaves and
      heavy clusters of grapes. The deceased should have been a jolly bottleman;
      but the epitaph indicated nothing of the kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a remote part of the graveyard,&mdash;remote from the main body of dead
      people,&mdash;I noticed a humble, mossy stone, on which I traced out "To
      the memory of Julia Africa, servant of Rev." somebody. There were also the
      half-obliterated traces of other graves, without any monuments, in the
      vicinity of this one. Doubtless the slaves here mingled their dark clay
      with the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Litchfield there is a doctor who undertakes to cure deformed people,&mdash;
      and humpbacked, lame, and otherwise defective folk go there. Besides
      these, there were many ladies and others boarding there, for the benefit
      of the air, I suppose.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Canaan, Connecticut, before the tavern, there is a doorstep, two or
      three paces large in each of its dimensions; and on this is inscribed the
      date when the builder of the house came to the town,&mdash;namely, 1731.
      The house was built in 1751. Then follows the age and death of the
      patriarch (at over ninety) and his wife, and the births of, I think,
      eleven sons and daughters. It would seem as if they were buried
      underneath; and many people take that idea. It is odd to put a family
      record in a spot where it is sure to be trampled underfoot.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Springfield, a blind man, who came in the stage,&mdash;elderly,&mdash;sitting
      in the reading-room, and, as soon as seated, feeling all around him with
      his cane, so as to find out his locality, and know where he may spit with
      safety! The cautious and scientific air with which he measures his
      distances. Then he sits still and silent a long while,&mdash;then inquires
      the hour,&mdash;then says, "I should like to go to bed." Nobody of the
      house being near, he receives no answer, and repeats impatiently, "I'll go
      to bed." One would suppose, that, conscious of his dependent condition, he
      would have learned a different sort of manner; but probably he has lived
      where he could command attention.

      their trunk, and rubbing down the table.

      A withered, yellow, sodden, dead-alive looking woman,&mdash;an
      opium-eater. A deaf man, with a great fancy for conversation, so that his
      interlocutor is compelled to halloo and bawl over the rumbling of the
      coach, amid which he hears best. The sharp tones of a woman's voice appear
      to pierce his dull organs much better than a masculine voice. The
      impossibility of saying anything but commonplace matters to a deaf man, of
      expressing any delicacy of thought in a raised tone, of giving utterance
      to fine feelings in a bawl. This man's deafness seemed to have made his
      mind and feelings uncommonly coarse; for, after the opium-eater had
      renewed an old acquaintance with him, almost the first question he asked,
      in his raised voice, was, "Do you eat opium now?"

      wish I had a thousand such fellows in Alabama." It made a strange
      impression on me,&mdash;the negro was really so human!&mdash;and to talk
      of owning a thousand like him!

      ladylike thing. She is pretty, young, and married; for a little boy comes

      A note on colored paper is brought her; and she reads it, and puts it in
      her bosom. At another window, at some depth within the apartment, a
      gentleman in a dressing-gown, reading, and rocking in an easy-chair, etc.,
      etc., etc. A rainy day, and people passing with umbrellas disconsolately
      between the spectator and these various scenes of indoor occupation and
      comfort. With this sketch might be mingled and worked up some story that
      was going on within the chamber where the spectator was situated.

      interested in the child, from its threatened blindness, that it was
      infinitely harder to give it up. Had he not been aware of it till after
      the child's death, it would probably have been a consolation.

      Singular character of a gentleman (H. H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, Esq.) living
      in retirement in Boston,&mdash;esteemed a man of nicest honor, and his
      seclusion attributed to wounded feelings on account of the failure of his
      firm in business. Yet it was discovered that this man had been the mover
      of intrigues by which men in business had been ruined, and their property
      absorbed, none knew how or by whom; love-affairs had been broken off, and
      much other mischief done; and for years he was not in the least suspected.
      He died suddenly, soon after suspicion fell upon him. Probably it was the
      love of management, of having an influence on affairs, that produced these
      phenomena.

      The house on the eastern corner of North and Essex Streets [Salem],
      supposed to have been built about 1640, had, say sixty years later, a
      brick turret erected, wherein one of the ancestors of the present
      occupants used to practise alchemy. He was the operative of a scientific
      person in Boston, the director. There have been other alchemists of old in

      composed by the letters are alone distinguishable. Close at hand, the
      figures alone are seen, and not distinguished as letters. Thus things may
      have a positive, a relative, and a composite meaning, according to the
      point of view.

      A young man in search of happiness,&mdash;to be personified by a figure

      little bare young ones, which, on the slightest noise, lift their heads,
      and open wide mouths for food,&mdash;immediately dropping their heads,
      after a broad gape. The action looks as if they were making a most
      earnest, agonized petition. In another egg, as in a coffin, I could
      discern the quiet, death-like form of the little bird. The whole thing had
      something awful and mysterious in it.

      Boston, July 3d, 1839.&mdash;I do not mean to imply that I am unhappy or
      discontented, for this is not the case. My life only is a burden in the
      same way that it is to every toilsome man; and mine is a healthy
      weariness, such as needs only a night's sleep to remove it. But from
      henceforth forever I shall be entitled to call the sons of toil my
      brethren, and shall know how to sympathize with them, seeing that I
      likewise have risen at the dawn, and borne the fervor of the midday sun,
      nor turned my heavy footsteps homeward till eventide. Years hence,
      perhaps, the experience that my heart is acquiring now will flow out in
      truth and wisdom.

    <p>
      August 27th.&mdash;I have been stationed all day at the end of Long Wharf,
      and I rather think that I had the most eligible situation of anybody in
      Boston. I was aware that it must be intensely hot in the midst of the
      city; but there was only a short space of uncomfortable heat in my region,
      half-way towards the centre of the harbor; and almost all the time there
      was a pure and delightful breeze, fluttering and palpitating, sometimes
      shyly kissing my brow, then dying away, and then rushing upon me in
      livelier sport, so that I was fain to settle my straw hat more tightly
      upon my head. Late in the afternoon, there was a sunny shower, which came
      down so like a benediction that it seemed ungrateful to take shelter in
      the cabin or to put up an umbrella. Then there was a rainbow, or a large
      segment of one, so exceedingly brilliant and of such long endurance that I
      almost fancied it was stained into the sky, and would continue there
      permanently. And there were clouds floating all about,&mdash; great clouds
      and small, of all glorious and lovely hues (save that imperial crimson
      which was revealed to our united gaze),&mdash;so glorious indeed, and so
      lovely, that I had a fantasy of heaven's being broken into fleecy
      fragments and dispersed through space, with its blest inhabitants dwelling
      blissfully upon those scattered islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      February 7th, 1840.&mdash;What beautiful weather this is!&mdash;beautiful,
      at least, so far as sun, sky, and atmosphere are concerned, though a poor,
      wingless biped is sometimes constrained to wish that he could raise
      himself a little above the earth. How much mud and mire, how many pools of
      unclean water, how many slippery footsteps, and perchance heavy tumbles,
      might be avoided, if we could tread but six inches above the crust of this
      world. Physically we cannot do this; our bodies cannot; but it seems to me
      that our hearts and minds may keep themselves above moral mud-puddles and
      other discomforts of the soul's pathway.
    </p>
    <p>
      February 11th.&mdash;I have been measuring coal all day, on board of a
      black little British schooner, in a dismal dock at the north end of the
      city. Most of the time I paced the deck to keep myself warm; for the wind
      (northeast, I believe) blew up through the dock, as if it had been the
      pipe of a pair of bellows. The vessel lying deep between two wharfs, there
      was no more delightful prospect, on the right hand and on the left, than
      the posts and timbers, half immersed in the water, and covered with ice,
      which the rising and falling of successive tides had left upon them, so
      that they looked like immense icicles. Across the water, however, not more
      than half a mile off, appeared the Bunker Hill Monument; and what
      interested me considerably more, a church-steeple, with the dial of a
      clock upon it, whereby I was enabled to measure the march of the weary
      hours. Sometimes I descended into the dirty little cabin of the schooner,
      and warmed myself by a red-hot stove, among biscuit-barrels, pots and
      kettles, sea-chests, and innumerable lumber of all sorts,&mdash;my
      olfactories, meanwhile, being greatly refreshed by the odor of a pipe,
      which the captain, or some one of his crew, was smoking. But at last came
      the sunset, with delicate clouds, and a purple light upon the islands; and
      I blessed it, because it was the signal of my release.
    </p>
    <p>
      February 12th.&mdash;All day long again have I been engaged in a very
      black business,&mdash;as black as a coal; and, though my face and hands
      have undergone a thorough purification, I feel not altogether fit to hold
      communion with doves. Methinks my profession is somewhat akin to that of a
      chimney-sweeper; but the latter has the advantage over me, because, after
      climbing up through the darksome flue of the chimney, he emerges into the
      midst of the golden air, and sings out his melodies far over the heads of
      the whole tribe of weary earth-plodders. My toil to-day has been cold and
      dull enough; nevertheless, I was neither cold nor dull.
    </p>
    <p>
      March 15th.&mdash;I pray that in one year more I may find some way of
      escaping from this unblest Custom-House; for it is a very grievous
      thraldom. I do detest all offices,&mdash;all, at least, that are held on a
      political tenure. And I want nothing to do with politicians. Their hearts
      wither away, and die out of their bodies. Their consciences are turned to
      india-rubber, or to some substance as black as that, and which will
      stretch as much. One thing, if no more, I have gained by my custom-house
      experience,&mdash;to know a politician. It is a knowledge which no
      previous thought or power of sympathy could have taught me, because the
      animal, or the machine rather, is not in nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      March 23d.&mdash;I do think that it is the doom laid upon me, of murdering
      so many of the brightest hours of the day at the Custom-House, that makes
      such havoc with my wits, for here I am again trying to write worthily, . .
      . . yet with a sense as if all the noblest part of man had been left out
      of my composition, or had decayed out of it since my nature was given to
      my own keeping. . . . Never comes any bird of Paradise into that dismal
      region. A salt or even a coal ship is ten million times preferable; for
      there the sky is above me, and the fresh breeze around me, and my
      thoughts, having hardly anything to do with my occupation, are as free as
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, you are not to fancy that the above paragraph gives a
      correct idea of my mental and spiritual state. . . . It is only once in a
      while that the image and desire of a better and happier life makes me feel
      the iron of my chain; for, after all, a human spirit may find no
      insufficiency of food fit for it, even in the Custom-House. And, with such
      materials as these, I do think and feel and learn things that are worth
      knowing, and which I should not know unless I had learned them there, so
      that the present portion of my life shall not be quite left out of the sum
      of my real existence. . . . It is good for me, on many accounts, that my
      life has had this passage in it. I know much more than I did a year ago. I
      have a stronger sense of power to act as a man among men. I have gained
      worldly wisdom, and wisdom also that is not altogether of this world. And,
      when I quit this earthly cavern where I am now buried, nothing will cling
      to me that ought to be left behind. Men will not perceive, I trust, by my
      look, or the tenor of my thoughts and feelings, that I have been a
      custom-house officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      April 7th.&mdash;It appears to me to have been the most uncomfortable day
      that ever was inflicted on poor mortals. . . . Besides the bleak, unkindly
      air, I have been plagued by two sets of coal-shovellers at the same time,
      and have been obliged to keep two separate tallies simultaneously. But I
      was conscious that all this was merely a vision and a fantasy, and that,
      in reality, I was not half frozen by the bitter blast, nor tormented by
      those grimy coal-beavers, but that I was basking quietly in the sunshine
      of eternity. . . . Any sort of bodily and earthly torment may serve to
      make us sensible that we have a soul that is not within the jurisdiction
      of such shadowy demons,&mdash;it separates the immortal within us from the
      mortal. But the wind has blown my brains into such confusion that I cannot
      philosophize now.
    </p>
    <p>
      April 19th.&mdash;. . . . What a beautiful day was yesterday! My spirit
      rebelled against being confined in my darksome dungeon at the
      Custom-House. It seemed a sin,&mdash;a murder of the joyful young day,&mdash;a
      quenching of the sunshine. Nevertheless, there I was kept a prisoner till
      it was too late to fling myself on a gentle wind, and be blown away into
      the country. . . . When I shall be again free, I will enjoy all things
      with the fresh simplicity of a child of five years old. I shall grow young
      again, made all over anew. I will go forth and stand in a summer shower,
      and all the worldly dust that has collected on me shall be washed away at
      once, and my heart will be like a bank of fresh flowers for the weary to
      rest upon. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      6 P. M.&mdash;I went out to walk about an hour ago, and found it very
      pleasant, though there was a somewhat cool wind. I went round and across
      the Common, and stood on the highest point of it, where I could see miles
      and miles into the country. Blessed be God for this green tract, and the
      view which it affords, whereby we poor citizens may be put in mind,
      sometimes, that all his earth is not composed of blocks of brick houses,
      and of stone or wooden pavements. Blessed be God for the sky too, though
      the smoke of the city may somewhat change its aspect,&mdash;but still it
      is better than if each street were covered over with a roof. There were a
      good many people walking on the mall,&mdash;mechanics apparently, and
      shopkeepers' clerks, with their wives; and boys were rolling on the grass,
      and I would have liked to lie down and roll too.
    </p>
    <p>
      April 30th.&mdash;. . . . I arose this morning feeling more elastic than I
      have throughout the winter; for the breathing of the ocean air has wrought
      a very beneficial effect. . . . What a beautiful, most beautiful afternoon
      this has been! It was a real happiness to live. If I had been merely a
      vegetable,&mdash;a hawthorn-bush, for instance,&mdash; I must have been
      happy in such an air and sunshine; but, having a mind and a soul, . . . .
      I enjoyed somewhat more than mere vegetable happiness. . . . The footsteps
      of May can be traced upon the islands in the harbor, and I have been
      watching the tints of green upon them gradually deepening, till now they
      are almost as beautiful as they ever can be.
    </p>
    <p>
      May 19th.&mdash;. . . . Lights and shadows are continually flitting across
      my inward sky, and I know neither whence they come nor whither they go;
      nor do I inquire too closely into them. It is dangerous to look too
      minutely into such phenomena. It is apt to create a substance where at
      first there was a mere shadow. . . . If at any time there should seem to
      be an expression unintelligible from one soul to another, it is best not
      to strive to interpret it in earthly language, but wait for the soul to
      make itself understood; and, were we to wait a thousand years, we need
      deem it no more time than we can spare. . . . It is not that I have any
      love of mystery, but because I abhor it, and because I have often felt
      that words may be a thick and darksome veil of mystery between the soul
      and the truth which it seeks. Wretched were we, indeed, if we had no
      better means of communicating ourselves, no fairer garb in which to array
      our essential being, than these poor rags and tatters of Babel. Yet words
      are not without their use even for purposes of explanation,&mdash;but
      merely for explaining outward acts and all sorts of external things,
      leaving the soul's life and action to explain itself in its own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a misty disquisition I have scribbled! I would not read it over for
      sixpence.
    </p>
    <p>
      May 29th.&mdash;Rejoice with me, for I am free from a load of coal which
      has been pressing upon my shoulders throughout all the hot weather. I am
      convinced that Christian's burden consisted of coal; and no wonder he felt
      so much relieved, when it fell off and rolled into the sepulchre. His
      load, however, at the utmost, could not have been more than a few bushels,
      whereas mine was exactly one hundred and thirty-five chaldrons and seven
      tubs.
    </p>
    <p>
      May 30th.&mdash;. . . . On board my salt-vessels and colliers there are
      many things happening, many pictures which, in future years, when I am
      again busy at the loom of fiction, I could weave in; but my fancy is
      rendered so torpid by my ungenial way of life that I cannot sketch off the
      scenes and portraits that interest me, and I am forced to trust them to my
      memory, with the hope of recalling them at some more favorable period. For
      these three or four days I have been observing a little Mediterranean boy
      from Malaga, not more than ten or eleven years old, but who is already a
      citizen of the world, and seems to be just as gay and contented on the
      deck of a Yankee coal-vessel as he could be while playing beside his
      mother's door. It is really touching to see how free and happy he is,&mdash;how
      the little fellow takes the whole wide world for his home, and all mankind
      for his family. He talks Spanish,&mdash;at least that is his native
      tongue; but he is also very intelligible in English, and perhaps he
      likewise has smatterings of the speech of other countries, whither the
      winds may have wafted this little sea-bird. He is a Catholic; and
      yesterday being Friday he caught some fish and fried them for his dinner
      in sweet-oil, and really they looked so delicate that I almost wished he
      would invite me to partake. Every once in a while he undresses himself and
      leaps overboard, plunging down beneath the waves as if the sea were as
      native to him as the earth. Then he runs up the rigging of the vessel as
      if he meant to fly away through the air. I must remember this little boy,
      and perhaps I may make something more beautiful of him than these rough
      and imperfect touches would promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      June 11th.&mdash;. . . . I could wish that the east-wind would blow every
      day from ten o'clock till five; for there is great refreshment in it to us
      poor mortals that toil beneath the sun. We must not think too unkindly
      even of the east-wind. It is not, perhaps, a wind to be loved, even in its
      benignest moods; but there are seasons when I delight to feel its breath
      upon my cheek, though it be never advisable to throw open my bosom and
      take it into my heart, as I would its gentle sisters of the south and
      west. To-day, if I had been on the wharves, the slight chill of an
      east-wind would have been a blessing, like the chill of death to a
      world-weary man.
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . . But this has been one of the idlest days that I ever spent in
      Boston. . . . In the morning, soon after breakfast, I went to the
      Athenaeum gallery, and, during the hour or two that I stayed, not a single
      visitor came in. Some people were putting up paintings in one division of
      the room; but I had the other all to myself. There are two pictures there
      by our friend Sarah Clarke,&mdash;scenes in Kentucky.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the picture-gallery I went to the reading-rooms of the Athenaeum, and
      there read the magazines till nearly twelve; thence to the Custom-House,
      and soon afterwards to dinner with Colonel Hall; then back to the
      Custom-House, but only for a little while. There was nothing in the world
      to do, and so at two o'clock I cane home and lay down, with the Faerie
      Queene in my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      August 21st.&mdash;Last night I slept like a child of five years old, and
      had no dreams at all,&mdash;unless just before it was time to rise, and I
      have forgotten what those dreams were. After I was fairly awake this
      morning, I felt very bright and airy, and was glad that I had been
      compelled to snatch two additional hours of existence from annihilation.
      The sun's disk was but half above the ocean's verge when I ascended the
      ship's side. These early morning hours are very lightsome and quiet.
      Almost the whole day I have been in the shade, reclining on a pile of
      sails, so that the life and spirit are not entirely worn out of me. . . .
      The wind has been east this afternoon,&mdash;perhaps in the forenoon, too,&mdash;and
      I could not help feeling refreshed, when the gentle chill of its breath
      stole over my cheek. I would fain abominate the east-wind, . . . . but it
      persists in doing me kindly offices now and then. What a perverse wind it
      is! Its refreshment is but another mode of torment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Salem, Oct. 4th. Union Street [Family Mansion]&mdash;. . . . Here I sit in
      my old accustomed chamber, where I used to sit in days gone by. . . . Here
      I have written many tales, many that have been burned to ashes, many that
      doubtless deserved the same fate. This claims to be called a haunted
      chamber, for thousands upon thousands of visions have appeared to me in
      it; and some few of them have become visible to the world. If ever I
      should have a biographer, he ought to make great mention of this chamber
      in my memoirs, because so much of my lonely youth was wasted here, and
      here my mind and character were formed; and here I have been glad and
      hopeful, and here I have been despondent. And here I sat a long, long
      time, waiting patiently for the world to know me, and sometimes wondering
      why it did not know me sooner, or whether it would ever know me at all,&mdash;
      at least, till I were in my grave. And sometimes it seemed as if I were
      already in the grave, with only life enough to be chilled and benumbed.
      But oftener I was happy,&mdash;at least, as happy as I then knew how to
      be, or was aware of the possibility of being. By and by, the world found
      me out in my lonely chamber, and called me forth,&mdash;not, indeed, with
      a loud roar of acclamation, but rather with a still, small voice,&mdash;and
      forth I went, but found nothing in the world that I thought preferable to
      my old solitude till now. . . . And now I begin to understand why I was
      imprisoned so many years in this lonely chamber, and why I could never
      break through the viewless bolts and bars; for if I had sooner made my
      escape into the world, I should have grown hard and rough, and been
      covered with earthly dust, and my heart might have become callous by rude
      encounters with the multitude. . . . But living in solitude till the
      fulness of time was come, I still kept the dew of my youth and the
      freshness of my heart. . . . I used to think I could imagine all passions,
      all feelings, and states of the heart and mind; but how little did I know!
      . . . . Indeed, we are but shadows; we are not endowed with real life, and
      all that seems most real about us is but the thinnest substance of a
      dream,&mdash;till the heart be touched. That touch creates us,&mdash;then
      we begin to be,&mdash;thereby we are beings of reality and inheritors of
      eternity. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      When we shall be endowed with our spiritual bodies, I think that they will
      be so constituted that we may send thoughts and feelings any distance in
      no time at all, and transfuse them warm and fresh into the consciousness
      of those whom we love. . . . But, after all, perhaps it is not wise to
      intermix fantastic ideas with the reality of affection. Let us content
      ourselves to be earthly creatures, and hold communion of spirit in such
      modes as are ordained to us. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not at the end of Long Wharf to-day, but in a distant region,&mdash;my
      authority having been put in requisition to quell a rebellion of the
      captain and "gang" of shovellers aboard a coal-vessel. I would you could
      have beheld the awful sternness of my visage and demeanor in the execution
      of this momentous duty. Well,&mdash;I have conquered the rebels, and
      proclaimed an amnesty; so to-morrow I shall return to that paradise of
      measurers, the end of Long Wharf,&mdash;not to my former salt-ship, she
      being now discharged, but to another, which will probably employ me
      well-nigh a fortnight longer. . . . Salt is white and pure,&mdash;there is
      something holy in salt. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      I have observed that butterflies&mdash;very broad-winged and magnificent
      butterflies&mdash;frequently come on board of the salt-ship, where I am at
      work. What have these bright strangers to do on Long Wharf, where there
      are no flowers nor any green thing,&mdash;nothing but brick storehouses,
      stone piers, black ships, and the bustle of toilsome men, who neither look
      up to the blue sky, nor take note of these wandering gems of the air? I
      cannot account for them, unless they are the lovely fantasies of the mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      November.&mdash;. . . . How delightfully long the evenings are now! I do
      not get intolerably tired any longer; and my thoughts sometimes wander
      back to literature, and I have momentary impulses to write stories. But
      this will not be at present. The utmost that I can hope to do will be to
      portray some of the characteristics of the life which I am now living, and
      of the people with whom I am brought into contact, for future use. . . .
      The days are cold now, the air eager and nipping, yet it suits my health
      amazingly. I feel as if I could run a hundred miles at a stretch, and jump
      over all the houses that happen to be in my way. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      I have never had the good luck to profit much, or indeed any, by attending
      lectures, so that I think the ticket had better be bestowed on somebody
      who can listen to Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; more worthily. My evenings are
      very precious to me, and some of them are unavoidably thrown away in
      paying or receiving visits, or in writing letters of business, and
      therefore I prize the rest as if the sands of the hour-glass were gold or
      diamond dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was invited to dine at Mr. Baucroft's yesterday with Miss Margaret
      Fuller; but Providence had given me some business to do, for which I was
      very thankful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is not this a beautiful morning? The sun shines into my soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      April, 1841.&mdash;. . . . I have been busy all day, from early
      breakfast-time till late in the afternoon; and old Father Time has gone
      onward somewhat less heavily than is his wont when I am imprisoned within
      the walls of the Custom-House. It has been a brisk, breezy day, an
      effervescent atmosphere, and I have enjoyed it in all its freshness,&mdash;breathing
      air which had not been breathed in advance by the hundred thousand pairs
      of lungs which have common and indivisible property in the atmosphere of
      this great city. My breath had never belonged to anybody but me. It came
      fresh from the wilderness of ocean. . . . It was exhilarating to see the
      vessels, how they bounded over the waves, while a sheet of foam broke out
      around them. I found a good deal of enjoyment, too, in the busy scene
      around me; for several vessels were disgorging themselves (what an
      unseemly figure is this,&mdash;"disgorge," quotha, as if the vessels were
      sick) on the wharf, and everybody seemed to be working with might and
      main. It pleased me to think that I also had a part to act in the material
      and tangible business of this life, and that a portion of all this
      industry could not have gone on without my presence. Nevertheless, I must
      not pride myself too much on my activity and utilitarianism. I shall,
      doubtless, soon bewail myself at being compelled to earn my bread by
      taking some little share in the toils of mortal men. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Articulate words are a harsh clamor and dissonance. When man arrives at
      his highest perfection, he will again be dumb! for I suppose he was dumb
      at the Creation, and must go round an entire circle in order to return to
      that blessed state.

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
