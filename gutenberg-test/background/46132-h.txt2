PREFACE.


My object in writing this book for boys is to
furnish them with a narrative of the struggle
between York and Lancaster       a struggle which
extended over thirty years, deluged England
with blood, cost a hundred thousand lives,
emasculated the old nobility, and utterly destroyed
the house of Plantagenet.

It is generally admitted that no period in
England's history is richer in romantic incident
than the three decades occupied by the Wars
of the Roses; but the contest is frequently described
as having been without interest in a political
point of view. This idea seems erroneous.
That struggle of thirty years was no mere
strife of chiefs, ambitious of supremacy and unscrupulous
as to means. Indeed, the circumstances
of the country were such that no hand
would have been lifted against sovereigns       whether
reigning by Parliamentary or hereditary
right       who showed a due respect to ancient
rights and liberties. But the tyranny exercised,[Pg viii]
first by the ministers of the sixth Henry,
and afterward by those of the fourth Edward       one
influenced by Margaret of Anjou,
the other by the Duchess of Bedford, both "foreign
women"       was such as could not be borne
by Englishmen without a struggle; and evidence
exists that Richard Neville, in arming
the people against these kings, did so to prevent
the establishment of that despotism which
John Hampden and Oliver Cromwell afterward
fought to destroy.

With such impressions as to the origin of the
war which, during the fifteenth century, agitated
England and perplexed Continental rulers,
I have, in the following pages, traced the course
of events from the plucking of the roses in the
Temple Gardens to the destruction of Richard
the Third, and the coronation of Henry Tudor,
on Bosworth Field. And I venture to hope
that a book written to attract English boys of
this generation to a remarkable epoch in the
mediæval history of their country will be received
with favor, and read with interest, by
those for whose perusal it is more particularly
intended.

INTRODUCTION.
The Plantagenets.


About the middle of the ninth century a
warrior named Tertullus, having rendered signal
services to the King of France, married
Petronella, the king's cousin, and had a son
who flourished as Count of Anjou. The descendants
of Tertullus and Petronella rose rapidly,
and exercised much influence on French
affairs. At length, in the twelfth century,
Geoffrey, Count of Anjou, surnamed Plantagenet,
from wearing a sprig of flowering broom
instead of a feather, espoused Maude, daughter
of Henry Beauclerc, King of England; and
Henry Plantagenet, their son, succeeded, on
the death of Stephen, to the English throne.

Having married Eleanor, heiress of Aquitaine,
and extended his continental empire from
the Channel to the Pyrenees, Henry ranked as
the most potent of European princes. But,
though enabled to render great services to England,[Pg x]
he was not an Englishman; and, indeed,
it was not till the death of John, at Swinehead,
that the English had a king who could be regarded
as one of themselves. That king was
Henry the Third, born and educated in England,
and sympathizing with the traditions of
the people over whom he reigned.

Unfortunately for Henry, he was surrounded
by Continental kinsmen, whose conduct caused
such discontent that clergy, barons, citizens,
and people raised the cry of England for the
English; and Simon de Montfort, though foreign
himself, undertook to head a movement
against foreigners. A barons' war was the consequence.
Henry, defeated at Lewes, became
a prisoner in the hands of the oligarchy; and
there was some prospect of the crown passing
from the house of Plantagenet to that of Montfort.

At this crisis, however, Edward, eldest son
of the king, escaped from captivity, destroyed
the oligarchy in the battle of Evesham, and entered
upon his great and glorious career. Space
would fail us to expatiate on the services which,
when elevated to the throne as Edward the
First, that mighty prince rendered to England.
Suffice it to say that he gave peace, prosperity,[Pg xi]
and freedom to the people, formed hostile races
into one great nation, and rendered his memory
immortal by the laws which he instituted.[1]

For the country which the first Edward rendered
prosperous and free, the third Edward
and his heroic son won glory in those wars
which made Englishmen, for a time, masters
of France. Unhappily, the Black Prince died
before his father; and his only son, who succeeded
when a boy as Richard the Second, departed
from right principles of government.
This excited serious discontent, and led the
English people to that violation of "the lineal
succession of their monarchs" which caused the
Wars of the Roses.

Besides the Black Prince, the conqueror of
Cressy had by his queen, Philippa       the patroness
of Froissart       several sons, among whom
were Lionel, Duke of Clarence; John of Gaunt,
Duke of Lancaster; and Edmund of Langley,[Pg xii]
Duke of York.[2] Lionel died early; but John
of Gaunt survived his father and eldest brother,
and was suspected of having an eye to the
crown which his young nephew wore. No
usurpation, however, was attempted. But when
John was in the grave, his son, Henry of Bolingbroke,
returning from an irksome exile, deposed
Richard, and sent him prisoner to Pontefract[Pg xiii]
Castle, where he is understood to have
been murdered.

On the death of Richard, who was childless,
Henry the Fourth, as son of John of Gaunt,
would have had hereditary right on his side,
but that Lionel of Clarence had left a daughter,
Philippa, wife of Mortimer, Earl of March,
and ancestress of three successive earls. Of
these, Edmund, the last earl, was a boy when
Henry of Bolingbroke usurped the throne; and
his sister, Anne Mortimer, was wife of Richard
Plantagenet, Earl of Cambridge, second son of
Edmund of Langley, Duke of York. "This
was that princely branch," says Sandford, "by
the ingrafting of which into the stock of York,
that tree brought forth not only White Roses,
but crowns and sceptres also."

Henry the Fourth regarded young March
with jealousy, and had him vigilantly guarded.
But Henry the Fifth completely won the earl's
loyalty, and made him a most zealous adherent.
March showed no ambition to reign;
and the nation, intoxicated with Agincourt
and glory and conquest, cared not an iota for
his claims. At the time when the hero-king
expired at Vincennes and the Earl of March
died in England the dynastic dispute was[Pg xiv]
scarcely remembered, and it would never, in
all probability, have been revived had the
Lancastrian government not become such as
could not be submitted to without degradation.
It was when law and decency were defied, and
when Englishmen were in danger of being enslaved
by a "foreign woman," that they remembered
the true heir of the Plantagenets
and took up arms to vindicate his claims.

THE WARS OF THE ROSES.




CHAPTER I.

THE MONK-MONARCH AND HIS MISLEADERS.


On St. Nicholas's Day, in the year 1421, there
was joy in the castle of Windsor and rejoicing in
the city of London. On that day Katherine de
Valois, youthful spouse of the fifth Henry, became
mother of a prince destined to wear the crown of
the Plantagenets; and courtiers vied with citizens
in expressing gratification that a son had been born
to the conqueror of Agincourt       an heir to the kingdoms
of England and France.

Henry of Windsor, whose birth was hailed with
a degree of enthusiasm which no similar event had
excited in England, was doomed to misfortune from
his cradle. He was not quite nine months old when
Henry the Fifth departed this life at Vincennes;
and he was still an infant when Katherine de Valois
forgot her hero-husband and all dignity for the sake
of a Welsh soldier with a handsome person and an
imaginary pedigree. The young king, however, was
the beloved of a thousand hearts. As son of a hero[Pg 18]
who had won imperishable glory for England, the
heir of Lancaster was regarded by Englishmen with
sincere affection; the legitimacy of his title even was
unquestioned; and the genius of his uncles, John,
Duke of Bedford, and Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester,
under whose auspices the royal boy was crowned
in London and Paris, created a feeling of security
seldom felt by kingdoms at the beginning of long
minorities.

For a time the aspect of affairs was cheering.
At a critical period, however, Bedford expired at
Rouen; and ere long England was distracted by a
feud between Gloucester and that spurious son of
John of Gaunt, known in history as Cardinal Beaufort,
and as chief of a house which then enjoyed
the dukedom of Somerset. Gloucester charged the
cardinal with contempt for the laws of the realm;
and the cardinal avenged himself by accusing Gloucester's
duchess of endeavoring to destroy the king
by witchcraft, and banishing her to the Isle of Man.
It soon appeared that the rivalry between Duke
Humphrey and his illegitimate kinsman would involve
the sovereign and people of England in serious
disasters.

Nature had not gifted Henry of Windsor with
the capacity which would have enabled a sovereign
to reconcile such foes. Never had the Confessor's
crown been placed on so weak a head. Never had[Pg 19]
the Conqueror's sceptre been grasped by so feeble a
hand. The son of the fifth Henry was more of a
monk than a monarch, and in every respect better
qualified for the cloister than for courts and camps.
In one respect, however, the king's taste was not
monastic. Notwithstanding his monkish tendencies
he did not relish the idea of celibacy; and the rival
chiefs, perceiving his anxiety to marry, cast their
eyes over Europe to discover a princess worthy of
enacting the part of Queen of England.

Gloucester was the first to take the business in
hand. Guided at once by motives of policy and
patriotism, he proposed to unite his nephew to a
daughter of the Count of Armagnac; and he trusted,
by an alliance, to allure that powerful French
noble to the English interest. The king did not
object to the Armagnac match. Before striking a
bargain, however, he felt a natural desire to know
something of the appearance of his future spouse;
and with this view he employed a painter to furnish
portraits of the count's three daughters. Before
the portraits could be executed circumstances put
an end to the negotiations. In fact, the dauphin,
as the English still called the seventh Charles of
France, having no reason to regard the proposed
marriage with favor, placed himself at the head of
an army, seized upon the count and his daughters,
and carried them off as prisoners of state.

[Pg 20]

Meanwhile, Beaufort was not idle. Eager to
mortify Gloucester and increase his own influence,
the aged cardinal was bent on uniting the king to
Margaret of Anjou, daughter of René of Provence,
and niece of the French monarch. René, indeed,
though titular sovereign of Jerusalem and the two
Sicilies, was poor, and Margaret, albeit the Carlovingian
blood flowed in her veins, was portionless.
But, though not favored by fortune, the Provençal
princess was richly endowed by nature; and, young
as she was, the unrivaled beauty and intellect of
King René's daughter had made her name familiar
in France and famous in England.

Never was an intriguer more successful than Beaufort.
While Gloucester was negotiating with the
Count of Armagnac, the cardinal, aware of Margaret's
charms, contrived to have a likeness of the
princess transmitted to the court of England; and
the young king became so enamored of the fair
being whom the portrait represented that his wish
to espouse her could not decently be combated.
Matrimonial negotiations were therefore resolved
on; and William de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk, was
sent as embassador to bring home the princess.
René drove a hard bargain. Before consenting to
the marriage he insisted on the restoration of Maine
and Anjou, which were among the Continental conquests
that the English were in no humor to surrender.[Pg 21]
But Suffolk, who was thinking more of his
own interests than of his country's honor, yielded
without scruple; and the marriage of King René's
daughter was made the basis of a treaty which could
not fail to prove unpopular. At first, however, no
complaint was uttered. Suffolk brought the royal
bride to England, and declared, in allusion to her
poverty, that her beauty and intellect were worth
more than all the gold in the world.

One day in April, 1445, the marriage of Henry
of Windsor and Margaret of Anjou was solemnized
at the Abbey of Tichfield       the bridegroom being in
his twenty-fourth, the bride in her sixteenth year.
The religious ceremony having been performed, the
wedded pair were conducted to the capital of their
dominions, and the English, being then devotedly
loyal, were prepared to welcome the spouse of
young Henry to London with an enthusiasm which
could hardly fail to intoxicate so young a princess.
The nobles, displaying all the pride and pomp of
feudalism, wore the queen's badge in honor of her
arrival. At Greenwich, Gloucester, as first prince
of the blood, though known to have been averse to
the match, paid his respects, attended by five hundred
men, dressed in her livery. At Blackheath appeared
the mayor, aldermen, and sheriffs of London,
arrayed in scarlet robes, and mounted on horseback,
to escort her through Southwark into the city.[Pg 22]
Passing under triumphal arches to Westminster, she
was crowned in the Abbey; and that ceremony was
the occasion of general rejoicing. The shows, the
pageants, the tournaments, the display of feudal banners
by the nobles, and loud applause of the populace
might well have led the royal pair to prognosticate
a life of peace and happiness. Nobody, who
witnessed the universal joy, could have supposed
that England was on the eve of the bloodiest dynastic
struggle recorded in her history.

In fact, the people of England, knowing nothing
of the restitution of Maine and Anjou, were at first
delighted with their queen, and enraptured with
her beauty. Her appearance was such as could
hardly fail to please the eye and touch the heart.
Imagine a princess in her teens, singularly accomplished,
with a fair complexion, soft, delicate features,
bright, expressive eyes, and golden hair flowing
over ivory shoulders; place a crown upon her
head, which seemed to have been formed to wear
such a symbol of power; array her graceful figure
in robes of state, and a mantle of purple fastened
with gold and gems; and you will have before
your mind's eye the bride of Henry of Windsor, as
on the day of her coronation she appeared among
peers and prelates and high-born dames in the Abbey
of Westminster.

Unfortunately for Margaret of Anjou, her prudence[Pg 23]
and intelligence were not equal to her wit
and beauty. Ere two years passed the popularity
she enjoyed vanished into empty air; but she was
a woman of defiant courage, and far from taking
any pains to regain the affections of the people, she
openly manifested her dislike of Gloucester, who
was their favorite and their idol. Indeed, the young
queen never could forgive the duke's opposition to
her marriage; and she listened readily to the counsels
of Beaufort and Suffolk, who, in the spring of
1447, resolved, at all hazards, to accomplish his
ruin.

With this view, a parliament was summoned to
meet at Bury St. Edmunds; and Gloucester, suspecting
no snare, rode thither, with a small retinue,
from the castle of Devizes. At first, nothing occurred
to raise his apprehension; but, in a few days,
to his surprise, he found himself arrested by the
Constable of England, on the charge of conspiracy
to murder the king and seize the crown.

Gloucester was never brought to trial; and it
was said that Suffolk and the cardinal, finding that
every body ridiculed the charge of conspiracy,
caused "The Good Duke" to be assassinated. Appearances
rather strengthened the popular suspicion.
One evening, about the close of February, Gloucester
was in perfect health: next morning he was
found dead in bed. The indecent haste with which[Pg 24]
Suffolk seized upon the duke's estates was commented
on with severity; and Margaret of Anjou
shared the suspicion that had been excited.

The cardinal did not long survive the man who
was believed to have been his victim. Early in the
month of April, Beaufort died in despair, bitterly
reproaching his riches, that they could not prolong
his life; and Suffolk, now without a rival, so conducted
himself as to incur the perfect hatred of the
nation. The English people had a peculiar aversion
to favorites, and remembered that while weak
sovereigns, like the third Henry and the second
Edward, had been ruined by such creatures, great
kings, like the first and third Edward, had done excellently
well without them. Suffolk was every day
more and more disliked; and in 1449 his unpopularity
reached the highest point.

The position of Suffolk now became perilous.
Impatient at their Continental reverses, and exasperated
at the loss of Rouen, the people exhibited a
degree of indignation that was overwhelming, and
the duke, after being attacked in both houses of
Parliament, found himself committed to the Tower.
When brought to the bar of the Lords, Suffolk,
aware of his favor at court, threw himself on the
mercy of the king; and, every thing having been arranged,
the lord chancellor, in Henry's name, sentenced
him to five years' banishment. The peers[Pg 25]
protested against this proceeding as unconstitutional;
and the populace were so furious at the idea
of the traitor escaping, that, on the day of his liberation,
they assembled in St. Giles's Fields to the
number of two thousand, with the intention of
bringing him to justice. But Suffolk evaded their
vigilance, and, at Ipswich, embarked for the Continent.

On the 2d of May, 1450, however, as the banished
duke was sailing between Dover and Calais,
he was stopped by an English man-of-war, described
as the Nicholas of the Tower, and ordered to come
immediately on board. As soon as Suffolk set foot
on deck, the master of the Nicholas exclaimed,
"Welcome, traitor;" and, for two days, kept his
captive in suspense. On the third day, however,
the duke was handed into a cock-boat, in which
appeared an executioner, an axe, and a block; and
the death's-man, having without delay cut off the
head of the disgraced minister, contemptuously cast
the headless trunk on the sand.

While England's sufferings, from disasters abroad
and discord at home, were thus avenged on the
queen's favorite, the king was regarded with pity
and compassion. Henry, in fact, was looked upon
as the victim of fate; and a prophecy, supposed to
have been uttered by his father, was cited to account
for all his misfortunes. The hero-king, according[Pg 26]
to rumor, had, on hearing of his son's birth
at Windsor, shaken his head, and remarked prophetically,
"I, Henry of Monmouth, have gained
much in my short reign; Henry of Windsor shall
reign much longer, and lose all. But God's will
be done."

Margaret of Anjou shared her favorite's unpopularity;
and, when she reached the age of twenty,
the crown which had been placed on her head amid
so much applause became a crown of thorns. Exasperated
at the loss of their Continental conquests,
Englishmen recalled to mind that she was a kinswoman
and protégée of the King of France; and
when it was known that, to secure her hand for
their sovereign, Maine and Anjou had been surrendered,
sturdy patriots described her as the cause of
a humiliating peace, and, with bitter emphasis, denounced
her as "The Foreign Woman."

These men were not altogether unreasonable.
In fact, the case proved much worse for England
than even they anticipated; and, ere long, France
was gratified with a thorough revenge on the foe
by whom she had been humbled to the dust, from
having placed on the Plantagenets' throne a princess
capable, by pride and indiscretion, of rousing a civil
war that ruined the Plantagenets' monarchy.



[Pg 27]




CHAPTER II.

THE DUKE OF YORK AND THE KING-MAKER.


When Suffolk fell a victim to the popular indignation,
Richard, Duke of York, first prince of the
blood, was governing Ireland, with a courage worthy
of his high rank, and a wisdom worthy of his
great name. Indeed, his success was such as much
to increase the jealousy with which the queen had
ever regarded the heir of the Plantagenets.

York was descended, in the male line, from Edmund
of Langley, fifth son of the third Edward,
and was thus heir-presumptive to the crown which
the meek Henry wore. But the duke had another
claim, which rendered him more formidable than, as
heir-presumptive, he would ever have made himself;
for, through his mother, Anne Mortimer, daughter
of an Earl of March, he inherited the blood of
Lionel of Clarence, elder brother of John of Gaunt,
and, in this way, could advance claims to the English
crown, which, in a hereditary point of view,
were infinitely superior to those of the house of
Lancaster.

Richard Plantagenet was nearly ten years older
than King Henry. He first saw the light in 1412;[Pg 28]
and, when a mere child, became, by the execution
of his father, the Earl of Cambridge, at Southampton,
and the fall of his uncle, the Duke of York, at
Agincourt, heir of Edmund of Langley. His father's
misfortune placed Richard, for a time, under
attainder; but after the accession of Henry the
dignities of the house of York were restored; and
in 1424, on the death of Edmund, last of the Earls
of March, the young Plantagenet succeeded to the
feudal power of the house of Mortimer.

An illustrious pedigree and a great inheritance
rendered York a most important personage; and,
as years passed over, he was, by Gloucester's influence,
appointed Regent of France. In that situation
the duke bore himself like a brave leader in
war and a wise ruler in peace; but, as it was feared
that he would obstruct the surrender of Maine
and Anjou, he was displaced by Suffolk, and succeeded
by the Duke of Somerset, who, it was well
known, would be most accommodating.

When York returned to England, the queen, not
relishing a rival so near the throne, determined to
send him out of the way. She, therefore, caused
the duke to be appointed, for ten years, to the government
of Ireland, and then dispatched armed men
to seize him on the road and imprison him in the
castle of Conway. York, however, was fortunate
enough to escape the queen's snares; and, reaching[Pg 29]
Ireland in safety, he not only gave peace to that
country, but, by his skillful policy, won much favor
among the inhabitants.

Time passed on; and the disappearance of Suffolk,
of Beaufort, of Gloucester, and of Bedford from
the theatre of affairs opened up a new scene. As
minister of the king and favorite of the queen, Beaufort
and Suffolk were succeeded by Somerset; as
first prince of blood and hero of the people, Bedford
and Gloucester were succeeded by York. Moreover,
the absence of the duke from the country
caused much discontent. "If," said the people, "he
who brought the wild, savage Irish to civil fashions
and English urbanity once ruled in England, he
would depose evil counselors, correct evil judges, and
reform all unamended matters."

Firmly established the house of Lancaster then
was; but York had friends sufficiently powerful to
make him a formidable rival to any dynasty. In
youth he had married Cicely, daughter of Ralph
Neville, first Earl of Westmoreland; and, of all the
English magnates of the fifteenth century, the Nevilles,
who drew strength at once from an illustrious
Saxon origin and distinguished Norman alliances,
were by far the most powerful and popular.

The Nevilles derived the descent, in the male line,
from the Anglo-Saxon Earls of Northumberland.
Their ancestor, Cospatrick, figured in youth at the[Pg 30]
court of Edward the Confessor, and, relishing neither
the sway of Harold the Usurper, nor of William
the Conqueror, passed most of his life in adversity
and exile. After much suffering he died at Norham,
on the south bank of the Tweed, and left two
sons, who were more fortunate. One of these founded
the house of Dunbar, whose chiefs for hundreds
of years flourished with honor and renown; the
other was grandfather of Robert Fitzmaldred, who
married the heiress of the Nevilles, and was progenitor
of that proud family, whose seat was long at
Raby. About the beginning of the fifteenth century
the house of Dunbar fell, and great was the fall
thereof. About the beginning of the fifteenth century
the Nevilles attained to the earldom of Westmoreland,
and to a point of grandeur unrivaled
among the nobles of England.

Among the chiefs of the house of Neville, Ralph,
first Earl of Westmoreland, was one of the most important.
His possessions were so extensive that, besides
the castle of his Anglo-Saxon ancestors and
those of Brancepath, Middleham, and Sheriff Hutton,
inherited through Norman heiresses of great
name, he possessed about fifty manor-houses; and
his feudal following was so grand that, at times, he
assembled in the great hall at Raby no fewer than
seven hundred knights, who lived on his lands in time
of peace, and followed his banner in war. Even the[Pg 31]
earl's children were more numerous than those of
his neighbors. He was twice married; and the
Duchess of York, known among northern men as
"The Rose of Raby," was the youngest of a family
of twenty-two. John Neville, Ralph's eldest son by
his first countess, was progenitor of those chiefs who,
as Earls of Westmoreland, maintained baronial rank
at Raby, till one of them risked and lost all in the
great northern rebellion against Elizabeth. Richard
Neville, Ralph's eldest son by his second countess,
obtained the hand of the heiress of the Montagues,
and with her hand their earldom of Salisbury and
their vast possessions.

In the Continental wars and domestic struggles
in which Englishmen indulged during the fifteenth
century, Salisbury was recognized as a man of military
prowess and political influence. But almost
ere reaching middle age his fame grew pale before
that of his eldest son, Richard Neville, who espoused
the heiress of the Beauchamps, who, in her right,
obtained the earldom of Warwick, and who, as time
passed on, became celebrated throughout Europe as
the king-maker.

At the name of "The Stout Earl," as the people
of England proudly called him, the fancy conjures
up a mail-clad man of the tallest stature and the
most majestic proportions; with dark brown hair
clustering over a magnificent head, resting firmly[Pg 32]
and gracefully on mighty shoulders; a brow marked
with thought, perhaps not without traces of care; a
complexion naturally fair, but somewhat bronzed by
exposure to the sun and wind; a frank and open
countenance lighted up with an eye of deep blue,
and reflecting the emotions of the soul, as clouds
are reflected in a clear lake; and a presence so noble
and heroic that, compared with him, the princes
and peers of our day would sink into utter insignificance.
Unfortunately, no portrait capable of conveying
an adequate idea of Warwick's appearance
exists for the instruction of our generation; but
traditions and chronicles lead to the conclusion
that, if a Vandyke or a Reynolds had existed in the
fifteenth century to transmit to posterity the king-maker
as, in form and feature, he appeared to his
contemporaries in Westminster Hall, in Warwick
Castle, or on Towton Field, such a portrait, by such
an artist, would not belie our conceptions as to the
personal grandeur of the warrior-statesman of mediæval
England.

But, however that might be, Warwick was the
hero of his own times. From early youth he was
in great favor with the people; and, as years passed
on, his frankness, affability, sincerity, love of justice,
and hatred of oppression endeared him to their
hearts. In an age of falsehood and fraud, his word
was never broken nor his honor tarnished. Even
the lofty patrician pride, which rendered him an[Pg 33]
object of mingled awe and envy to the Woodvilles,
the Howards, and the Herberts, recommended him
to the multitude; for the new men, whom the descendant
of Cospatrick would not recognize as his
peers, were the instruments used by despotic sovereigns
to grind the faces of the poor. Moreover,
Warwick's patriotism was ardent; and the nation
remarked with gratification, that "The Stout Earl"
was animated by all those English sympathies which,
banished from courts and parliaments, still found a
home in cottage and in grange.

Besides being the most patriotic, Warwick had the
good fortune to be the richest, of England's patricians;
and his immense revenues were expended in
such a way that his praise as the people's friend was
ever on the tongues of the poor and needy. His
hospitality knew no bounds. The gate of his mansion
in London stood open to all comers; six oxen
were usually consumed at a breakfast; no human
being was sent hungry away; and every fighting
man had the privilege of walking into the kitchen
and helping himself to as much meat as could be
carried away on the point of a dagger. At the same
time, thirty thousand persons are said to have feasted
daily at the earl's mansions and castles in various
parts of England.

And it was not merely as a patriot and a popular
patrician that Richard Neville was distinguished, for[Pg 34]
great was his renown as a warrior and a statesman.
On fields of fight his bearing reminded men of the
Paladins of romance; and when he broke, sword in
hand, into foemen's ranks, the cry of "A Warwick!
A Warwick!" did more service to his friends than
could the lances of five hundred knights. While
Warwick's martial prowess made him the idol of
the soldiery, his capacity for affairs secured him general
confidence and admiration. "The Stout Earl,"
said the people, "is able to do any thing, and without
him nothing can be done well."

With such a friend as Warwick in England the
Duke of York doubtless felt secure that his hereditary
claims were in little danger of being quite forgotten
during his absence. The duke was in Ireland,
when an incident, immortalized by Shakspeare,
gave life and color to the rival factions. One day
a violent dispute as to the rights of the houses of
York and Lancaster took place in the Temple Gardens.
The disputants, "The Stout Earl" and the
Duke of Somerset, appealed to their friends to take
sides in the controversy; but these, being the barons
of England, declined to enter upon such "nice sharp
quillets of the law." Warwick thereupon plucked
a white rose, and Somerset a red rose; and each
asked his friends to follow his example. Thus originated
the badges of the chiefs who involved England
in that sanguinary struggle celebrated by poets
and chroniclers as the Wars of the Roses.



[Pg 35]




CHAPTER III.

THE CAPTAIN OF KENT.


In the summer of 1450 there was a ferment
among the commons of Kent. For some time, indeed,
the inhabitants of that district of England
had been discontented with the administration of
affairs; but now they were roused to action by
rumors that Margaret of Anjou, holding them responsible
for the execution of Suffolk, had vowed
revenge; that a process of extermination was to be
forthwith commenced; and that the country, from
the Thames to the Straits of Dover, was to be converted
into a hunting-forest for the queen and her
favorites.

About the middle of June, while the indignation
of the Kentishmen was at its height, a military
adventurer, who has since been known as "Jack
Cade," but who called himself John Mortimer, and
gave out that his mother was a Lacy, suddenly appeared
among the malcontents, informed them that
he was related to the Duke of York, and offered to
be their captain. According to the chroniclers, he
was "a young man of goodly stature, and pregnant
wit," and he told his story so plausibly, that the[Pg 36]
men of Kent believed he was York's cousin. Delighted
with the notion of having found a Mortimer
to lead them to battle, and to free them from oppression,
the people crowded by thousands to his
standard; and Cade, having assumed the title of
Captain of Kent, arrayed them in good order,
marched toward London, and encamped on Blackheath.

The men of Kent were not foes to be despised.
They had ever claimed the privilege of marching in
the van of England's army, and had so borne themselves
on fields of fight, that their courage was beyond
dispute. The determined spirit by which
they were known to be animated rather daunted
the court; and the king, in alarm, sent to ask why
they had left their homes. Cade replied in a manner
at which a government owing its existence to a
revolution had little reason to take umbrage. He
sent a document, entitled "Complaint of the Commons
of Kent," containing a statement of grievances,
demanding speedy redress, and requesting,
in respectful language, the dismissal of the corrupt
men by whom the king was surrounded, and the
recall of "the Duke of York, late exiled from the
royal presence."

The queen and her friends saw that something
must be done, and that quickly. An army was,
therefore, levied in the king's name; and, at the[Pg 37]
head of it, Henry advanced to Blackheath; but
Cade, wishing to draw the royal force into Kent,
broke up his camp and retreated to the quiet old
market-town of Sevenoaks. The queen, doubtless
somewhat surprised at the storm she had raised,
dreaded the possibility of the king being environed
by the insurgents. She, therefore, deputed the
danger of encountering Cade to a gallant knight
named Humphrey Stafford, and, having done so,
retired to Greenwich.

On receiving the queen's commands, Stafford, and
some of the court gallants, put on their rich armor
and gorgeous surcoats, mounted their horses, and,
with a detachment of the royal army, dashed off to
engage the insurgents, all eagerness, as it seemed, to
bring back the leader's head as a trophy. On coming
up with the foe, however, the ardor of the gay
warriors rapidly cooled; for, in posting his troops
in Sevenoaks Wood, the Captain of Kent had made
his dispositions with such masterly skill, that the
insurgents felt high confidence, and presented a formidable
front. Nevertheless, Stafford did not shrink
from an encounter. Boldly dashing onward, he attacked
the Kentishmen in their strong-hold. His
courage, however, was of no avail. At the very onslaught,
he fell in front of his soldiers; and they,
fighting with no good-will, allowed themselves to be
easily defeated.

[Pg 38]

Proud of his victory, the Captain of Kent arrayed
himself in Stafford's rich armor, advanced toward
London, encamped once more on Blackheath, and
threatened to attack the metropolis. His success
had rendered him so popular a hero, that the Kentishmen,
under the delusion that all abuses were to
be reformed, called him "Captain Mendall;" and
the inhabitants of Surrey and Sussex, catching the
enthusiasm, crowded to his camp.

Margaret of Anjou had now cause for serious
alarm. The royal army could no longer be relied
on. Already many of the soldiers had deserted, and
those who remained were asking, with indignation,
why the Duke of York was not recalled. Aware of
all this, the king deputed Humphrey Stafford, first
Duke of Buckingham, a popular favorite, and a
prince of the blood, to repair to Cade's camp, and
expostulate with the rebels. The captain received
the duke with all due respect, but declared that the
insurgents could not lay down their arms, unless the
king would hear their complaints in person, and
pledge his royal word that their grievances should
be redressed.

When Buckingham returned with Cade's answer
to Greenwich, there was yet time for Henry to save
his regal dignity. Had he been capable of laying
aside his saintly theories for a few hours, bracing on
his armor, mounting his steed, and riding forth with[Pg 39]
words of courage and patriotism on his lips, he might
have won back the hearts of his soldiers, and either
scattered the insurgent army by force, or dissolved
it by persuasion. To do this, a king of England did
not require the animal courage of a C      ur de Lion,
or the political genius of an English Justinian. Any
of Henry's predecessors, even the second Edward or
the second Richard, could have mustered spirit and
energy sufficient for the occasion. But the monk-monarch,
having neither spirit nor energy, quietly
resigned himself to his fate; and the queen, terrified
at the commotion her imprudences had raised, disbanded
the royal army, charged Lord Scales to keep
the Tower, and, leaving London to its fate, departed
with her husband to seek security in the strong castle
of Kenilworth. There was quite as little discretion
as dignity in the king's precipitate retreat.
The most devoted adherents of the Red Rose might
well despair of the house of Lancaster standing long,
when they heard that the son of the conqueror of
Agincourt had fled before the ringleader of a rabble.

Not slow to take advantage of the king's absence,
the Captain of Kent moved from Blackheath to
Southwark. From that place he sent to demand
entrance into London; and, after a debate in the
Common Council, Sir Thomas Chalton, the mayor,
intimated that no opposition would be offered. Accordingly,
on the 3d of July, the insurgent leader[Pg 40]
crossed London Bridge       the single bridge of which
the capital then boasted       and led his followers into
the city.

The inhabitants of London must have felt some
degree of dismay. Both courtiers and citizens had
an idea what a mob was       what violence and bloodshed
the French capital had witnessed during the
outbreaks of the Cabochiens       of what horrors each
French province had been the scene during the Jacquerie.
Moreover, the ruins of the Savoy, destroyed
during Wat Tyler's insurrection, and towering
gloomily on the spot now occupied by the northern
approach to Waterloo Bridge, formed at least one
memorial of what mischief even English peasants
and artisans were capable, when roused by injustice
and oppression. At first, however, the Captain of
Kent displayed a degree of moderation hardly to have
been anticipated. Arrayed in Stafford's splendid
mail, he commenced his triumphal entry by indulging
in a little harmless vanity.

"Now," said he, stopping, and striking his staff on
London Stone, "now is Mortimer Lord of London."

"Take heed," said the mayor, who was standing
on the threshold of his door, and witnessed the scene,
"take heed that you attempt nothing against the
quiet of the city."

"Sir," answered Cade, "let the world take notice
of our honest intentions by our actions."

[Pg 41]

All that day the Captain of Kent appeared most
anxious to gain the good opinion of the citizens.
He issued proclamations against plunder, did his utmost
to preserve discipline, and in the evening he
marched quietly back to Southwark. Next morning,
however, he returned; and, perhaps, no longer
able to restrain the thirst of his followers for blood,
he resolved to gratify them by the execution of "a
new man."

Among the most obnoxious of the king's ministers
was James Fiennes, who held the office of
lord chamberlain, and enjoyed the dignity of Lord
Say. The rapid rise of this peer to wealth and
power had rendered him an object of dislike to the
old nobility; and his connection with Suffolk's administration
had rendered him an object of hatred
to the people. Besides, he had lately purchased
Knole Park, in the vicinity of Sevenoaks, and perhaps
had, as lord of the soil, given offense to the
commons of Kent by trenching on some of those
privileges which they cherished so fondly.

Ere entering London, the insurgents had made up
their minds to have Lord Say's head; and, aware
of the odium attached to his name, the unpopular
minister had taken refuge with Lord Scales in the
Tower. Scales had seen much service in France,
and highly distinguished himself in the wars of the
fifth Henry; but now he had reached his fiftieth[Pg 42]
summer; his bodily strength had decayed; and time
had perhaps impaired the martial spirit that had
animated his youthful exploits. At all events, instead
of defending Lord Say to the last, as might
have been expected, Scales allowed him to be taken
from the Tower and carried to Guildhall, and on
the ill-fated lord's arrival there the Captain of Kent
compelled the mayor and aldermen to arraign him
as a traitor. In vain Say protested against the proceeding,
and demanded a trial by his peers. The
captain twitted him with being a mock patrician,
and insisted upon the judges condemning the "buckram
lord." At length the insurgents lost patience,
hurried their prisoner into Cheapside, and, having
there beheaded him without farther ceremony, hastened
to execute vengeance upon his son-in-law, Sir
James Cromer, who, as sheriff of Kent, had incurred
their displeasure.

Intoxicated with triumph as the Captain of Kent
might be, the daring adventurer felt the reverse of
easy while passing himself off as a Mortimer, and
could not help dreading the consequence of his real
origin being revealed to those whom he had deluded.
Rumors were indeed creeping about that his name
was Jack Cade; that he was a native of Ireland;
that in his own country he had, for some time,
lived in the household of a knight, but that having
killed a woman and child he had entered the French[Pg 43]
service, and acquired the military skill which he
had displayed against Stafford. Moreover, some
chroniclers state that, to preclude the possibility of
exposure, he mercilessly executed those who were
suspected to know any thing of his antecedents,
and endeavored to insure the fidelity of his adherents
by allowing them to perpetrate various kinds
of enormity.

The citizens had hitherto submitted with patience;
but on the 5th of July a provoking outrage
roused them to resistance. On that day Cade, having
gratified his vanity and satiated his thirst for
blood, began to think of spoil. He commenced operations
under peculiar circumstances. After dining
with one of the citizens he requited the hospitality
of his host by plundering the house, and the
example of the captain was so faithfully followed by
his men that the Londoners perceived the propriety
of doing something for their defense. When, therefore,
Cade led his forces back to Southwark for the
night, and the shades of evening settled over London,
the inhabitants took counsel with Lord Scales,
and resolved upon fortifying the bridge so as to prevent
his return.

While Cade was passing the night of the 5th of
July at Southwark, reposing on his laurels, as it
were, at the White Hart, news was carried to him
that Lord Scales and the citizens were preparing to[Pg 44]
resist his return. With characteristic decision the
Captain of Kent sprang to arms, declared he should
force a passage forthwith, mustered his men, and
led them to the attack. Fortune, however, now declared
against him. A fierce combat took place,
and the citizens defended the bridge so courageously
that after a struggle of six hours the insurgents
were fain to retire to Southwark.

The courage of the mob now cooled; and the
king's ministers determined to try the effect of promises
never intended to be redeemed. Accordingly,
William Waynflete, Bishop of Winchester, appeared
with an offer of pardon to all who would return
peaceably home. At first the insurgents were divided
in opinion about accepting the bishop's terms;
but Cade showed an inclination to grasp at the pardon,
and finally all dispersed. The Captain of Kent,
however, had as little intention as the government
to act with honor; and within ten days he again appeared
in Southwark with a considerable following.
This time, however, the citizens, elate with victory,
presented a firm front; and, dismayed at their threatening
aspect, Cade retreated to Rochester. While
there, terrified at the feuds of his followers, he learned
with horror that a thousand marks had been offered
for his apprehension; and, alarmed at the probability
of being delivered up, he galloped across the
country toward the coast of Sussex, and, for some
time, wandered about in disguise.

[Pg 45]

The Captain of Kent was not destined to elude
the vengeance of the government which he had defied.
An esquire of the county, named Alexander
Iden, pursued the despairing insurgent, and found
him lurking in a garden at Rothfield. Cade did not
yield to his fate without a struggle. Drawing his
sword, he stood upon his defense; and both the captain
and the esquire being men of strength and courage,
a desperate conflict ensued. The victory, however,
fell to Iden; and Cade's head, after being carried
to the king, was set on London Bridge, his face
turned toward the hills of Kent. Many of his companions,
in spite of Bishop Waynflete's promise of
pardon, were subsequently taken and executed as
traitors.

Such was the end of a popular tumult, the origin
of which remains in considerable obscurity. Some
asserted that Jack Cade was merely an agent of
Richard Plantagenet, and did not hesitate to describe
"Captain Mendall" as "one of the Duke of York's
firebrands." No evidence exists, however, to show
that the "high and mighty prince," freely as his
great name might have been used by the insurgents,
had any thing to do with the enterprise. Nevertheless
the insurrection was not without influence
on the duke's fortunes, and it has ever been regarded
as a prelude to the fierce struggle between the houses
of York and Lancaster.



[Pg 46]




CHAPTER IV.

THE RIVAL DUKES.


About the end of August, 1451, a rumor reached
the court of Westminster that the Duke of York had
suddenly left Ireland. The queen was naturally
somewhat alarmed; for, during Cade's insurrection,
the duke's name had been used in such a way as to
test his influence, and no doubt remained of the popularity
he enjoyed among the commons.

Margaret of Anjou had no wish to see York in
London. On the pretext, therefore, that the duke
came with too large a force, the queen, at Somerset's
instigation, dispatched Lord Lisle, son of the
famous Talbot, to prevent his landing. York, however,
eluded the vigilance of his enemies, made his
way to London, paid his respects to the king, complained
of the misgovernment under which the country
was suffering; and, still mute as to his intentions,
retired to Fotheringay, a castle which had been
built by his ancestor, Edmund of Langley.

The absence of York from court exercised more
influence in London than his presence could have
done, and soon after his return from Ireland a member
of the House of Commons boldly proposed that,[Pg 47]
since Henry had no issue and no prospect of any, the
duke should be declared heir to the throne. For his
temerity this senator was committed to the Tower;
but the Commons, who were not thus to be daunted,
passed a bill of attainder against the deceased Duke
of Suffolk, and presented a petition to the king for
the dismissal of Somerset, who was Suffolk's successor
and York's foe.

The name of the Duke of Somerset was Edmund
Beaufort. He was the illegitimate grandson of John
of Gaunt, nephew of Cardinal Beaufort, and brother
of that fair damsel whom James, the poet-king of
Scots, had wooed at Windsor, under circumstances
so romantic. He had, for several years, been Regent
of France, and in that capacity displayed considerable
vigor; but the loss of Normandy occurred
during his government, and this misfortune, coupled
with his violent temper, and the fact of his enjoying
the queen's favor, rendered Somerset's name as odious
to the multitude as that of Suffolk had ever been.
The queen, however, not being inclined to bow to
popular opinion, resisted the demand of the House
of Commons for her favorite's dismissal; and the
strife between the parties was carried on with a degree
of violence which, in any other country, would
have produced immediate war and bloodshed.

The heir of the Plantagenets, however, recognized
the necessity of acting with prudence. In fact, the[Pg 48]
Lancastrian dynasty was still so much in favor with
the nation that an attempt on York's part to seize
the crown would inevitably have added to the power
of his enemies; but in any efforts to put down
Somerset, and the men whom that obnoxious minister
used as the instruments of his tyranny, the duke
well knew that he carried with him the hearts of
the people and of those great patricians whom the
people regarded as their natural leaders.

Though the Earl of Westmoreland adhered to the
house of Lancaster the alliance of the other Nevilles
would of itself have rendered York formidable; and,
besides the Nevilles, there were many feudal magnates
who shared York's antipathy to Somerset.
Thomas, Lord Stanley, who had married Warwick's
sister; John Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, descended
from a granddaughter of the first Edward; John De
Vere, Earl of Oxford, whose ancestors had been great
in England since the Conquest; and Thomas Courtenay,
Earl of Devon, whose pedigree dated from the
age of Charlemagne, could not witness without indignation
the domination of Beauforts. "We are
unwilling," such men must have murmured, "to see
the court of Westminster converted into a sty for
the brood of Katherine Swynford."

York, for some time, hesitated to strike a blow;
but, at length, and not without reason, he lost all
patience. Indeed, the Yorkists affirmed that a plot
had been formed for imprisoning their chief, and[Pg 49]
putting him secretly to death; and the memory of
Humphrey of Gloucester's fate rendered people
credulous of any such report. To baffle any such
criminal project, a movement against Somerset was
resolved upon by the partisans of the White Rose;
and, about the opening of 1452, York repaired to
his castle of Ludlow, gathered an army among the
retainers of the house of Mortimer, and, declaring
that he had no evil intentions against the king, to
whom he offered to swear fealty on the sacrament,
commenced his march toward London.

The Lancastrians were alarmed at the intelligence
that the duke was in arms; and forces were mustered
to intercept his march. But while the royal
army went westward by one road York came eastward
by another, and, with several thousand men at
his back, appeared at the gates of London. The
metropolis, however, had aided in that revolution
which placed Henry of Bolingbroke on the throne,
and still continued well affected to the house of
Lancaster. York did not, therefore, meet with such
a reception as his friends could have wished. The
gates, in fact, were shut in his face; and, not wishing
to exasperate the citizens by acts of violence, he
marched up the banks of the Thames, crossed the
river at Kingston, and, having been joined by the
Earl of Devon, encamped his army on Brent Heath,
near Dartford.

[Pg 50]

Henry, meantime, ventured on taking the field,
and pitched his pavilion on Blackheath. It soon
appeared, however, that on neither side was there
any inclination to involve the country in civil war.
Negotiations were therefore opened; and two bishops,
commissioned to act for the king, proceeded to
the camp of the Yorkists and demanded of their
chief why he had appeared in arms.

The duke, who would seem to have been unaware
of the utter insincerity of his enemies, answered that
repeated attempts had been made to effect his ruin,
and that he was in arms for his own safety. The
bishops, who well knew how truly York spoke, admitted
that he had been watched with a jealous eye,
but assigned as a reason that the treasonable talk
of his adherents justified suspicion. On the king's
part, however, they acquitted him of all treason,
saying that Henry esteemed him as a true man and
well-beloved cousin; and York, maintaining a high
tone, insisted that all persons who had broken the
laws of the realm, especially those who had been
indicted for treason, should be put upon their trial.
The demand was so reasonable that compliance
could not with decency be refused; and Henry,
having promised that every offender should be punished,
issued an order for the apprehension of Somerset,
and gave York to understand that he should
have a place in the council.

[Pg 51]

Far from doubting the king's good faith, York
disbanded his army, and agreed to a personal interview
with his royal kinsman. The result was not
the most satisfactory. It proved beyond question
that, however saintly his theories, Henry was capable
of acting with an utter disregard of honor       that
he had little sympathy with the fine sentiment of
his ancestor, John de Valois, who, when advised to
violate a treaty with our third Edward, exclaimed:
"Were truth and sincerity banished from every
part of the earth, they ought yet to be found in the
mouths and the hearts of kings." It appears that
the queen had concealed Somerset behind the arras
of the king's tent, and no sooner did York enter,
and repeat what he had said to the two bishops,
than the favorite, stepping from behind a curtain,
offered to prove his innocence, and called York liar
and traitor.

The scene which followed may easily be imagined.
Somerset was violent and insolent; Henry, alarmed
and silent; York, indignant and scornful. The duke
could now entertain no doubt that he had been betrayed;
but his courage did not desert him. He
retorted Somerset's epithets with interest, and was
turning haughtily to take his departure, when informed
that he was a captive. Somerset then proposed
a summary trial and execution; but the courtiers
shrunk from the opprobrium of another murder.[Pg 52]
The king, who, save in the case of Lollards,
had no love of executions, took the more moderate
view; and the duke, instead of perishing on the scaffold,
was sent as a state prisoner to the Tower of
London.

While the queen and her friends were still bent
on York's destruction, a rumor that his eldest son
Edward, the boy-Earl of March, was coming from
Ludlow at the head of a strong body of Welshmen,
filled the council with alarm. The duke was thereupon
set at liberty, and, after making his submission,
allowed to retire to the borders of Wales. Having
reached the dominions of the Mortimers, the heir-presumptive
sought refuge within the walls of the
castles of Wigmore and Ludlow, repressed ambitious
longings and patriotic indignation, and, for the restoration
of better days to himself and his country, trusted
to the chapter of accidents and the course of
events.



[Pg 53]




CHAPTER V.

THE KING'S MALADY.


In the autumn of 1453 the queen was keeping
her court at Clarendon; the Duke of York was at
Wigmore and at Ludlow, maintaining a state befitting
the heir of the Mortimers; the barons were at
their moated castles, complaining gloomily of Henry's
indolence and Somerset's insolence; and the
people were expressing the utmost discontent at the
mismanagement that had, after a brave struggle, in
which Talbot and his son, Lord Lisle, fell, finally
lost Gascony; when a strange gloom settled over
the countenances of the Lancastrians, and mysterious
rumors crept about as to the king's health. At
length the terrible truth came out, and the Yorkists
learned that Henry was suffering from an eclipse of
reason, similar to that which had afflicted his maternal
grandsire, the sixth Charles of France. In this
state he was slowly removed from Clarendon to
Westminster.

About a month after the king's loss of reason,
there occurred another event, destined to exercise
great influence on the rival parties. At Westminster,
on the 14th of October, 1453, Margaret of[Pg 54]
Anjou, after having been for eight years a wife,
without being a mother, gave birth to an heir to
the English crown; and the existence of this boy,
destined to an end so tragic, while reviving the
courage of the Lancastrians, inspired the partisans
of the White Rose with a resolution to adopt bold
measures on behalf of their chief.

[Pg 55]

[Pg 56]BIRTH OF EDWARD OF LANCASTER.


At first, indeed, the Yorkists altogether refused
to believe in the existence of the infant prince.
When, however, that could no longer be denied,
they declared that there had been unfair play.
Finally, they circulated reports injurious to Margaret's
honor as a queen and reputation as a woman;
and rumor, which, ere this, had whispered
light tales of René's daughter, took the liberty of
ascribing to Somerset the paternity of her son.
Such scandals were calculated to repress loyal emotions;
and the courtiers attempted to counteract the
effect by giving the child a popular name. Accordingly,
the little prince, who had first seen the light
on St. Edward's Day, was baptized by that name,
which was dear to the people, as having been borne
by the last Anglo-Saxon king, and by the greatest
of the Plantagenets. Nobody, however, appears
to have supposed that because the boy was named
Edward, he would, therefore, prove equal in wisdom
and valor to the English Justinian, or the
conqueror of Cressy, or "the valiant and gentle[Pg 57]
Prince of Wales, the flower of all chivalry in the
world."

The insanity of the king, naturally enough,
brought about the recall of York to the council;
and when Parliament met in February, 1454, the
duke having, as Royal Commissioner, opened the
proceedings, the peers determined to arrive at a
knowledge of the king's real condition, which the
queen had hitherto endeavored to conceal. An
opportunity soon occurred.

On the 2d of March, 1454, John Kempe, Primate
and Chancellor of England, breathed his last. On
such occasions it was customary for the House of
Lords to confer personally with the sovereign, and,
accordingly, Henry being then at Windsor, twelve
peers were deputed to go thither for that purpose.
Their reception was not gracious; but they insisted
on entering the castle, and found the king utterly
incapable of comprehending a word. Three several
times they presented themselves in his chamber, but
in vain; and, returning to London, free from any
doubts, they made a report to the House which convinced
the most incredulous. "We could get," said
they, "no answer or sign from him for no prayer
nor desire." At the request of the twelve peers,
this report was entered on the records of Parliament;
and, ere two days passed, Richard, Duke of
York, was nominated Protector of England. His[Pg 58]
power was to continue until the king recovered, or,
in the event of Henry's malady proving incurable,
till young Edward came of age.

The duke, when intrusted by Parliament with
the functions of Protector, exercised the utmost
caution; and, while accepting the duties of the office,
was careful to obtain from his peers the most
explicit declaration that he only followed their noble
commandments. It is true that one of his first
acts was to intrust the great seal to the Earl of
Salisbury; but, on the whole, his moderation was
conspicuous; and the claims of Prince Edward, as
heir of England, having been fully recognized, he
was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester,
and a splendid provision was made for his maintenance.

With York at the head of the government, matters
went smoothly till the close of 1454; but in
the month of December the king's recovery threw
every thing into disorder. About Christmas Henry
awoke as from a confused dream; and, on St. John's
Day, he sent his almoner with an offering to Canterbury,
and his secretary on a similar errand to
the shrine of St. Edward.

The queen's hopes were now renewed and her
ambitions stimulated. Having in vain endeavored
to conceal the plight of her husband from the nation,
she marked his restoration with joy, and presented[Pg 59]
the prince to him with maternal pride.
Henry was, perhaps, slightly surprised to find himself
the father of a fine boy; but, manifesting a
proper degree of paternal affection, he asked by
what name his heir had been called. The queen
replied that he had been named Edward; and the
king, holding up his hands, thanked God that such
was the case. He was then informed that Cardinal
Kempe was no more; and he remarked, "Then one
of the wisest lords in the land is dead."

The king's recovery was bruited about; and, on
the morning after Twelfth Day, William Waynflete,
Bishop of Winchester, paid the royal invalid a visit.
Henry spoke to him as rationally as ever he had
been capable of doing; declaring, moreover, that he
was in charity with all the world, and wished his
lords were in the same frame of mind. The bishop,
on leaving the king, was so affected that he wept
for joy; the news spread from Thames to Tweed;
and, from Kent to Northumberland, the partisans
of the Red Rose congratulated each other on the
return of good fortune.



[Pg 60]




CHAPTER VI.

THE BATTLE OF ST. ALBANS.


When Henry recovered from his malady York
resigned the Protectorship, and Margaret of Anjou
again became all-powerful. The circumstances
were such that the exercise of moderation, toward
friends and foes, would have restored the Lancastrian
queen to the good opinion of her husband's
subjects. Unfortunately for her happiness, Margaret
allowed prejudice and passion to hurry her into
a defiance of law and decency.

It happened that, during the king's illness, Somerset
had been arrested in the queen's great chamber,
and sent to keep his Christmas in the Tower,
as a preliminary to his being brought to trial. No
sooner, however, did Margaret regain authority,
than her favorite was set at liberty; and people
learned with indignation that, instead of having to
answer for his offenses against the state, the unworthy
noble was to be appointed Captain-general
of Calais. After this, the Yorkists became convinced
that the sword alone could settle the controversy;
and, about the spring of 1455, the duke, repairing
to Ludlow, summoned, for the second time,[Pg 61]
his retainers, and prepared to display his banner in
actual war against the royal standard of England.
He had soon the gratification of being joined by the
two great Earls of Salisbury and Warwick, by John
Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, and by other men whose
rank and nobility lent lustre to the cause. Having
armed and arrayed the Marchmen of Wales, York
advanced toward the capital.

War was now inevitable; and Somerset did not
shrink from a conflict with the prince whose life he
had sought and whose vengeance he had defied. A
Lancastrian army was forthwith assembled; and at
its head Henry and Somerset, accompanied by many
men of influence, marched from London to face the
Yorkists in fight. Sir Philip Wentworth bore the
royal standard; and with the king went Humphrey,
Duke of Buckingham, and his son, Earl Stafford;
James Butler, chief of the house of Ormond, whom
Henry had created Earl of Wiltshire; Thomas, Lord
Clifford, from the Craven; and Hotspur's son, Henry
Percy, Earl of Northumberland, who, having in
youth been restored by Henry the Fifth, now went
out, at the age of threescore, to fight for the crown
worn by Henry's son. The people, however, held
aloof from the contest; and the army of the Red
Rose, composed entirely of nobles, with their knights,
and squires, and fighting men, does not appear to
have exceeded two thousand in number.

[Pg 62]

The king had not far to go in search of his kinsman.
After passing the night of Thursday, the 22d
of May, at Watford, and proceeding next morning to
St. Albans, the Lancastrians, when about to continue
their march, perceived that the hills in front
of them were covered with armed men, who moved
rapidly in battle order toward the ancient historic
town. On observing the approach of the Yorkist
foe, the Lancastrian leaders halted, set up the royal
standard, placed troops under the command of Lord
Clifford to guard the barriers, and sent the Duke of
Buckingham to confer with the White Rose chiefs,
who had encamped at Heyfield.

Richard Plantagenet, though a warrior of the highest
courage, had no relish for bloodshed; and he did
not forget that those to whom he now stood opposed
were Englishmen like himself. When, therefore,
Buckingham went, in Henry's name, to demand why
York thus appeared before his sovereign in hostile
array, the duke professed great loyalty, and replied
that he would at once lay down his arms if the king
would surrender Somerset to justice.

Buckingham, whose affection for the Beauforts
was not excessive, carried this answer to Henry; and
the duke's demand for the surrender of the queen's
favorite produced an effect which could hardly have
been anticipated. For once the monk-monarch
showed some spark of the Plantagenet, expressed[Pg 63]
the utmost scorn at the message, and swore by St.
Edward, as if he had been a conqueror of Evesham,
"that he would as soon deliver up his crown as either
Somerset or the meanest soldier in his camp."

Every prospect of an accommodation was now
dissipated; and the warriors of the White Rose,
who had remained inactive for three hours, prepared
for an encounter. Having addressed his adherents,
York advanced, with banners streaming
and clarions sounding, and at noon commenced that
struggle, which, thirty years later, was terminated
on the field of Bosworth.

From occupying St. Albans the Lancastrians had
the advantage of position, and such hopes of victory
that Somerset's men were ordered to put to death
all the Yorkists who should be taken prisoners.
Moreover, Clifford made a brave defense, and for a
time the duke was kept in check at the barriers.
The Yorkists, among other weapons of offense, had
guns; and Warwick and Salisbury had such a degree
of skill in using them as their enemies could
not boast of. Yet so steadily were they resisted by
Clifford that the prospect of coming to close conflict
with the foe appeared distant; and the partisans of
York looked somewhat blank. But Warwick was
not a man to yield to obstacles. Leading his soldiers
round part of the hill on which St. Albans is
situated, that great war-chief broke down a high[Pg 64]
wall, ordered his trumpets to sound, crossed the
gardens which the wall inclosed, and, shouting
"A Warwick! A Warwick!" charged forward upon
the recoiling foe. On the Lancastrian ranks Warwick's
presence produced an immediate impression;
and the barriers having been burst, the Yorkists,
encouraged by "The Stout Earl's" war-cry, rushed
into the town, and came face to face with their foes.

A conflict now took place among the houses, in
the lanes, in the streets, and in the market-place.
The fight was fierce, as could not fail to be the case
in a struggle between men who had long cherished,
while restraining, their mortal hate; and the ancient
town was soon strewn with traces of the battle, and
crimsoned with the blood of the slain. The king's
friends made a desperate resistance; and delayed
the victory till the clash of mail reached the monks
in the abbey. But Warwick cheered on archer
and spearman to the assault; and York, not to be
baffled, re-enforced every party that was hard-pressed,
and pressed forward fresh warriors to relieve the
weary and the wounded. Humphrey, Earl Stafford,
bit the dust; Clifford fell, to be cruelly avenged on
a more bloody day; and Northumberland, who had
seen so many years and fought so many battles, died
under the weapons of his foes.

Somerset appears at first to have fought with a
courage worthy of the reputation he had won on[Pg 65]
the Continent; and on hearing that Clifford's soldiers
were giving way before Warwick's mighty
onslaught he rushed gallantly to the rescue. The
chief of the Beauforts, however, did not live to
bring aid to the men of the Craven. Years before,
the Lancastrian duke had been admonished by
a fortune-teller to beware of a castle; and, finding
himself suddenly under a tavern bearing that sign,
the warning occurred to his memory. Superstitious
like his neighbors, Somerset lost his presence of
mind, gave himself up for lost, became bewildered,
and was beaten down and slain. The fortune of the
day being decidedly against the Red Rose, the Earl
of Wiltshire cast his harness into a ditch and spurred
fast from the lost field; while Sir Philip Wentworth,
equally careful of his own safety, threw away the
royal standard, and fled toward Suffolk. The Lancastrians,
beaten and aware of Somerset's fall, rushed
through the gardens and leaped over hedges,
leaving their arms in the ditches and woods that
they might escape the more swiftly.

Ere this Henry had been wounded in the neck by
an arrow. Sad and sorrowful, he sought shelter in
a thatched house occupied by a tanner. Thither,
fresh from victory, went the duke; and treated his
vanquished kinsman with every respect. Kneeling
respectfully, the conqueror protested his loyalty, and
declared his readiness to obey the king. "Then,"[Pg 66]
said Henry, "stop the pursuit and slaughter, and I
will do whatever you will." The duke, having ordered
a cessation of hostilities, led the king to the
abbey; the royal kinsmen, after praying together
before the shrine of England's first martyr, journeyed
to London; and Margaret of Anjou, then with
her son at Greenwich, learned, with dismay, that
her favorite was a corpse and her husband a captive.
At such a time, while shedding tears of bitterness
and doubt within the palace built by Humphrey of
Gloucester, the young queen must have reflected,
with remorse, on the part she had taken against
"The Good Duke," and considered how different a
face affairs might have worn in 1455, if she had not,
in 1447, consented to the violent removal of the last
stately pillar that supported the house of Lancaster.



[Pg 67]




CHAPTER VII.

THE QUEEN AND THE YORKIST CHIEFS.


When the battle of St. Albans placed the king
and kingdom of England under the influence of the
Yorkists, the duke and his friends exercised their
authority with a moderation rarely exhibited in such
circumstances. No vindictive malice was displayed
against the vanquished; not a drop of blood flowed
on the scaffold; not an act of attainder passed the
Legislature. Every thing was done temperately and
in order.

As Henry was again attacked by his malady he
was intrusted to Margaret's care, and York was again
declared Protector of the realm, with a provision that
he was to hold the office, not as before at the king's
pleasure, but until discharged from it by the Lords
in Parliament. Salisbury was, at the same time, intrusted
with the Great Seal; and Warwick was appointed
to the government of Calais. Comines calls
Calais "the richest prize in the crown of England;"
and the government of the city was an office of greater
trust and profit than any which an English sovereign
had to bestow.

Margaret of Anjou, however, was not quite absorbed[Pg 68]
in her duties as wife and mother. While
educating her helpless son and tending her yet more
helpless husband, she was bent on a struggle for the
recovery of that power which she had already so
fatally abused; and as necessity alone had made her
submit to the authority of York and his two noble
kinsmen, who were satirized as the "Triumvirate,"
she seized the earliest opportunity of ejecting them
from power.

One day in spring, while the queen was pondering
projects of ambition, and glowing with anticipations
of vengeance, two noblemen of high rank and
great influence appeared at the palace of Greenwich.
One of these was Humphrey Stafford, Duke of Buckingham;
the other, Henry Beaufort, Duke of Somerset;
and their errand was to confer with Queen Margaret
on the present state of affairs. The queen
received them with open arms, expressed haughty
scorn of her potent foes, and reminded Buckingham
of the son he had lost at St. Albans, and Somerset
of the father he had lost on the same fatal day. The
dukes, having listened to all this, represented to Margaret
the indignity to which the king was subjected
in being deprived of all share in the government,
while York and his accomplices managed every thing
according to their pleasure. The queen heard her
friends with delight, vowed that the triumph of the
Yorkist chiefs should be brief, and resolved upon
acting without delay.

[Pg 69]

Accordingly it was determined to hold a council;
and the enemies of York were summoned to Greenwich.
After some debate as to the most politic
method of restoring the royal authority, the council
resolved that York should be commanded to resign
the office of protector, seeing that the king was of
years and discretion sufficient to rule without a
guardian, and that Salisbury should be commanded
to surrender the post of chancellor. "The great
seal," they said, "had never been in his custody,
that which he used having been made since the
king's restraint." Henry, for whose opinion none
of the Lancastrians had any respect, was easily prevailed
upon to give his sanction to their measures,
and York and Salisbury were discharged from their
high offices, and summoned to appear before the
council.

The duke and the earl were much too wise to
place themselves in the power of enemies who had,
on former occasions, proved so unscrupulous. They
answered boldly that there existed no power to displace
them or command their appearance, save in
Parliament. When, however, the houses assembled
after Christmas, 1456, Henry presented himself and
demanded back his regal power. Every body was
surprised; but no doubt was expressed as to the
king's sanity, and York, without a murmur, resigned
the protectorship.

[Pg 70]

The queen was not content with having deprived
the duke and the earl of power. Her ideas of revenge
went far beyond such satisfaction; and she
occupied her brain with schemes for putting her enemies
under her feet. Feigning indifference to affairs
of state, the artful woman pretended to give
herself up entirely to the restoration of the king's
health, and announced her intention of affording
Henry an opportunity to indulge in pastimes likely
to restore him to vigor of mind and body.

On this pretext the king and queen made a progress
into Warwickshire, hunting and hawking by
the way, till they reached Coventry. While residing
in that ancient city, and keeping her court in
the Priory, the queen wrote letters, in affectionate
terms, to York, Salisbury, and Warwick, earnestly
entreating them to visit the king on a certain day;
and the duke, with the two earls, suspecting no evil,
obeyed the summons, and rode toward Coventry.
On approaching the city, however, they received
warning that foul play was intended, and, turning
aside, escaped the peril that awaited them. York,
unattended save by his groom and page, made for
Wigmore; Salisbury repaired to Middleham, a great
castle of the Nevilles in Yorkshire; and Warwick
took shipping for Calais, which soon became his
strong-hold and refuge.

Totally unaware of the mischief projected by his[Pg 71]
spouse, but sincerely anxious for a reconciliation of
parties, Henry resolved on acting as peace-maker,
and, with that view, summoned a great council.
The king was all eagerness to reconcile York and
his friends with the Beauforts, Percies, and Cliffords,
whose kinsmen had been slain at St. Albans;
and he swore upon his salvation so to entertain the
duke and the two earls, that all discontent should
be removed. London was fixed upon as the place
of meeting; and, at the head of five thousand armed
men, the mayor undertook to prevent strife.

Accompanied by a number of friends and followers,
York entered the capital, and repaired to Baynard's
castle; the Earl of Salisbury arrived, with a
feudal following, at his mansion called the Harbor;
and Warwick, landing from Calais, rode into the
city, attended by six hundred men, with his badge,
the ragged staff, embroidered on each of their red
coats, and took possession of his residence near the
Grey Friars.

At the same time, the Lancastrian nobles mustered
strong. Henry Beaufort, Duke of Somerset;
Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland; and John,
"the black-faced" Lord Clifford, came riding toward
London, in feudal array, attended by hundreds
of the men of the west, of Northumberland,
and of the Craven. Each of the three had lost a
father in the first battle of the Roses; and, albeit[Pg 72]
young and vigorous, they were to pour out their
heart's blood in the struggle, ere a few years passed
over. But in no wise apprehensive did they seem,
as they alighted at their respective lodgings to the
west of Temple Bar. Thither, at the same time,
came Exeter, Buckingham, and Thomas Percy,
Lord Egremont, a younger son of that Earl of
Northumberland slain at St. Albans. Devon would
have been in London also; but, while on his way,
he fell sick, and died in the Abbey of Abingdon.

One circumstance connected with this attempt at
pacification was particularly noticed. While the
Yorkists lodged in the city, the Beauforts, Percies,
and Cliffords, sojourned on the west of Temple Bar;
and while one party held their deliberations in the
Black Friars, the other held their meetings in the
Chapter House at Westminster. The wits of the
period had their joke on the occasion, and said, that
as the Jews disdained the company of the Samaritans,
so the Lancastrian lords abhorred the idea of
familiarity with the White Rose chiefs.

The farce was played out. The king, who, during
the conferences, resided at Berkhamstead and acted
as umpire, in due time gave his award. The Yorkists
appear to have had scanty justice. They were
heavily mulcted, for the benefit of their living foes,
and ordered to build a chapel for the good of the
souls of the lords slain at St. Albans. Every body,[Pg 73]
however, appeared satisfied, and agreed to a religious
procession to St. Paul's, that they might convince
the populace how real was the concord that
existed. The day of the Conception was appointed
for this ceremony; and, to take part in it, the king
and queen came from Berkhamstead to London.

The procession was so arranged as to place in the
position of dear friends those whose enmity was supposed
to be the bitterest. The king, with a crown
on his head, and wearing royal robes, was naturally
the principal figure. Before him, hand in hand,
walked Salisbury and Somerset, Warwick and Exeter.
Behind him came York leading Margaret of
Anjou. The citizens were, perhaps, convinced that
Yorkists and Lancastrians were the best of friends.
All was delusion, however, naught was truth.
Though their hands were joined their hearts were
far asunder, and the blood already shed cried for
vengeance. Stern grew the brows of Lancastrian
lords, pale the cheeks of Lancastrian ladies, at the
mention of St. Albans. The Beauforts, Percies, and
Cliffords, still panted for vengeance, and vowed to
have an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.[3]

[Pg 74]

The procession to St. Paul's took place in spring,
and ere the summer was over events dissipated the
illusions which the scene created. Warwick, as Captain
of Calais, interfered with some ships belonging
to the Hanse Towns; and of this the Hanseatic
League complained to the court of England, as an
infraction of the law of nations. The earl was asked
for explanations; and to render them more clearly
presented himself at Westminster.

The opportunity for a quarrel was too favorable
to be neglected. One day, when Warwick was attending
the council at Westminster, a yeoman of
his retinue, having been struck by one of the royal
household, wounded his assailant. The king's servants
assembling at the news watched until the earl
was returning from the council to his barge, and set
upon him with desperate intentions. A fray ensued,
and Warwick, with some difficulty, escaped in
a wherry to London. Unfortunately, the mischief
did not end here. The queen, having heard of the
affair, acted with characteristic imprudence, and ordered[Pg 75]
Warwick to be sent to the Tower, and a cry
was therefore raised that "The Foreign Woman,"
who had murdered "The Good Duke Humphrey,"
was going to murder "The Stout Earl." Warwick,
however, consulted his safety by making for Yorkshire,
where he took counsel with York and Salisbury.
After this conference he passed over to Calais,
and during the winter employed himself in embodying
some veteran troops who had served under
Bedford and Talbot in the wars of France.



[Pg 76]




CHAPTER VIII.

THE CITY AND THE COURT.


One day, in the year 1456, a citizen of London,
passing along Cheapside, happened to meet an Italian
carrying a dagger. The citizen was a young
merchant who had lately been on the Continent,
and who had, in some of the Italian states, been
prohibited by the magistrates from wearing a weapon,
even for the defense of his life. Naturally indignant
at seeing an Italian doing in the capital of
England what an Englishman was not allowed to
do in the cities of Italy, the merchant ventured upon
stopping the foreigner and reminding him of the
laws of his own country.

Not having any relish for being thus challenged,
the Italian answered with some degree of insolence;
and the Englishman, stung to the quick, forcibly
seized the dagger of the foreigner, "and," according
to the chroniclers of the period, "with the same a
little cut his crown and cracked his pate." Enraged
at this assault, the Italian complained of the
outrage to the lord mayor; and the Englishman,
having been summoned to the court at Guildhall,
was committed to Newgate.

[Pg 77]

Between the London merchants of that day and
the foreigners carrying on business in London no
good-will existed. Free trade was not the fashion
of the age; and the inhabitants of the city, hating
the Italians for interfering with their commerce,
were ready on any fitting occasion to rise to the
tune of "England for the English." No sooner,
therefore, was it known that an Englishman had
been incarcerated for breaking an Italian's head
than he was regarded as a martyr to his patriotism;
and the Londoners, assembling in crowds, compelled
the mayor to deliver the merchant from prison,
and took the opportunity of attacking the houses
of all the Italians in London. The mayor, in the
utmost alarm, summoned the elder and graver of the
citizens to his assistance; and these, with much difficulty,
prevailed on the crowd to disperse to their
homes. As for the merchant, not seeing any security
under the circumstances, he repaired to Westminster,
and there took refuge in the sanctuary.

The riot in London created considerable sensation;
and, unfortunately, the queen, as if she had
not already business enough on her hands, took
upon herself to interfere, and expressed her intention
of inflicting signal punishment on the offenders.
With that purpose in view, she instructed two of her
dukes, Buckingham and Exeter, to proceed to the
city; and these noblemen, with the mayor and two
justices, opened a commission at Guildhall.

[Pg 78]

At first the business was conducted with all due
form, and the inquiry was ceremoniously prosecuted.
Suddenly, however, a great change occurred in the
city. Bow bell was rung, and at its sound the
streets filled with armed men, who appeared bent
on mischief. The queen's high-born commissioners
were, doubtless, as much taken by surprise as if Jack
Cade had come to life again; and, probably, not unmindful
of Lord Say's fate, they abandoned the inquiry
in a state of trepidation hardly consisting with
the dignity of a Stafford and a Holland. The city,
however, was nothing the worse for their absence;
indeed, the lord mayor, having thus got rid of his
lordly coadjutors, called some discreet citizens to his
aid, and dealt so prudently with the multitude, that
order was restored and justice satisfied.

The part enacted by the queen, in regard to the
quarrel between the English and Italians, destroyed
the last particle of affection which the inhabitants
of London entertained for the house of Lancaster;
and Margaret, for many reasons, began to prefer
Coventry to the metropolis. This, however, was not
the only result of her interference. In the eyes of
foreigners it elevated the riot to the dignity of an
insurrection, the French mistaking it for one of
those revolutions in which the Parisians, under
the auspices of Jean de Troyes and Jean Caboche,
were in the habit of indulging during the reign of
the unfortunate Charles.

[Pg 79]

The French were excusable in their delusion.
With an insane king and a reckless queen in both
cases the parallel was somewhat close. But the
French soon discovered their mistake. Having fitted
out two expeditions to avail themselves of our
domestic disorders, they intrusted one to Lord de
Pomyers, and the other to Sir Peter de Brezé. Pomyers
landed on the coast of Cornwall, and having
burned Towey, sailed back to France without doing
serious mischief. Brezé, with four thousand men,
embarked at Honfleur, made a descent on Sandwich,
and proceeded to spoil the town, which had
been deserted by its defenders on account of the
plague; but, the country people in the neighborhood
arriving in great numbers, the invaders were fain to
return to their ships.

Such was the end of the riot in London; and from
that time the metropolitan populace adhered to the
chiefs of the White Rose; and to that badge of
hereditary pride and personal honor they clung with
fidelity long after it had lost its bloom in the atmosphere
of a corrupt court, and been dyed red on scaffold
and battle-field in the blood of the noble and
the brave.

CHAPTER IX.

A YORKIST VICTORY AND A LANCASTRIAN REVENGE.


In the summer of 1459 Margaret of Anjou carried
the Prince of Wales on a progress through
Chester, of which he was earl. The queen's object
being to enlist the sympathies of the men of the
north, she caused her son, then in his sixth year, to
present a silver swan, which had been assumed as
his badge, to each of the principal adherents of the
house of Lancaster. Margaret had left the County
Palatine, and was resting from her fatigues at Eccleshall,
in Staffordshire, when she received intelligence
that the Yorkists were in motion; that the
duke was arraying the retainers of Mortimer beneath
the Plantagenet banner; that Warwick was on his
way from Calais with a body of warriors trained to
arms by Bedford and Talbot; and that Salisbury,
at the head of five thousand merry men of Yorkshire,
was moving from Middleham Castle to join his
son and his brother-in-law at Ludlow.

Notwithstanding the rout of her friends at St.
Albans, Margaret was not daunted at the prospect
of another trial of strength. Perhaps, indeed, she
rather rejoiced that the Yorkist chiefs afforded a fair[Pg 81]
opportunity of executing her vengeance and effecting
their ruin. Her measures, with that purpose,
were taken with characteristic promptitude. She
issued orders to James Touchet, Lord Audley, to intercept
Salisbury's march; and at the same time
summoned Thomas, Lord Stanley, to join the Lancastrian
army with all his forces. Stanley, who was
son-in-law of Salisbury, answered that he would
come in all haste, but failed to keep his promise.
Audley, however, exhibited more devotion to the
Red Rose. On receiving the queen's commands, he
undertook to bring her one Yorkist chief dead or
alive; and hastily assembling a force of ten thousand
men in Cheshire and Shropshire, boldly threw himself
between the earl and the duke. On the evening
of Saturday, the 22d of September, Audley came
face to face with Salisbury at Bloreheath, within a
short distance of Drayton, anciently the seat of those
Bassets who fought with so much distinction in the
wars of the first Edward.

The position of the Yorkists was the reverse of
pleasant. The Lancastrian army was greatly superior
in number, and Audley had the advantage of
being posted by the side of a stream, of which the
banks were particularly steep. But Salisbury was
not to be baffled. Seeing that there was little
prospect of success in the event of his crossing to
attack, the earl resolved on a military stratagem,[Pg 82]
and gave orders that his army should encamp for the
night.

Early on the morning of Sunday       it was St.
Tecla's Day       Salisbury set his men in motion; and,
having caused his archers to send a flight of shafts
across the river toward Audley's camp, feigned to
retreat. Audley soon showed that he was no match
for such an enemy. Completely deceived, the Lancastrian
lord roused his troops to action, caused his
trumpets to sound, and gave orders for his army passing
the river. His orders were promptly obeyed.
The men of Cheshire, who composed the van, dashed
into the water, and plunged through the stream;
but scarcely had they commenced ascending the opposite
banks when Salisbury turned, and attacked
them with that degree of courage against which superiority
of numbers is vain. The battle was, nevertheless,
maintained for hours, and proved most
sanguinary. The loss of the Yorkists was indeed
trifling,[4] but more than two thousand of the Red[Pg 83]
Rose warriors perished in the encounter. Audley
himself was slain, and with him some of the foremost
gentlemen of Cheshire and Lancashire, among
whom were the heads of the families of Venables,
Molyneux, Legh, and Egerton. The queen, who
witnessed the defeat of her adherents from the tower
of a neighboring church, fled back to digest her mortification
at Eccleshall.

The Earl of Salisbury soon found that his success
was calculated to convert neutrals into allies. Lord
Stanley, on receiving the queen's message, had gathered
a force of two thousand men; but, being reluctant
to commit himself on either side, he contrived,
on the day of battle, to be six miles from the
scene of action. On hearing of the result, however,
he sent a congratulatory letter to his father-in-law;
and Salisbury, showing the epistle to Sir
John Harrington, and others of his knights, said,
jocosely, "Sirs, be merry, for we have yet more
friends."

The contest between York and Lancaster now assumed
a new aspect. Salisbury, rejoicing in a victory
so complete as that of Bloreheath, formed a
junction with York at Ludlow; and the duke, perceiving
that moderation had been of so little avail,[Pg 84]
and believing that his life would be in danger so long
as Margaret of Anjou ruled England, resolved henceforth
upon pursuing a bolder course. He could not
help remembering that he was turned of forty, an
age at which, as the poet tells us, there is no dallying
with life; and he began to consider that the time
had arrived to claim the crown which was his by
hereditary right.

Having resolved no longer, by timidity in politics,
to play the game of his enemies, York set up his
standard and summoned his friends to Ludlow.
Fighting men came from various parts of England,
and assembled cheerily and in good order at the rendezvous;
while, to take part in the civil war, Warwick
brought from Calais those veterans who, in
other days, had signalized their valor against foreign
foes. The projects of the Yorkists seemed to flourish.
Salisbury's experience, knowledge, and military
skill were doubtless of great service to his
friends; and having thrown up intrenchments, and
disposed in battery a number of bombards and cannon,
they confidently awaited the enemy.

Meanwhile, the Lancastrians were by no means in
despair. The king, having, with the aid of the young
Dukes of Somerset and Exeter, drawn together a
mighty army at Worcester, sent the Bishop of Salisbury
to promise the Yorkists a general pardon if
they would lay down their arms. The Yorkists,[Pg 85]
however, had learned by severe experience what the
king's promises were worth, and received the bishop
like men who were no longer to be deluded. "So
long," said they, "as the queen has supreme power,
we have no faith in the king's pardon; but," they
added, "could we have assurance of safety, we should
express our loyalty, and humbly render ourselves at
the king's service."

The king, having received the answer of the insurgent
chiefs, advanced on the 13th of October to
the Yorkist camp, and made proclamation, that whoever
abandoned the duke should have the royal pardon.
Though this appeared to be without effect,
the king's army did not commence the attack. Indeed,
the Yorkist ranks were most imposing, and
the duke's guns wrought considerable havoc in the
Lancastrian lines. Observing the formidable attitude
of his foes, the king resolved to delay the assault
until the morrow; and, ere the sun again shone,
an unexpected incident had changed the face of matters,
and thrown the Yorkists into utter confusion.

Among those who heard the king's proclamation
was Andrew Trollope, captain of the veterans whom
Warwick had brought from Calais. This mighty
man-at-arms had served long in the French wars,
and cared not to draw his sword against the son of
the Conqueror of Agincourt. After listening to the
king's offers of pardon, and considering the consequences[Pg 86]
of refusing them, Trollope resolved upon deserting;
and, at dead of night, he quietly carried off
the Calais troops, and making for the royal camp,
revealed the whole of York's plans.

When morning dawned, and Trollope's treachery
was discovered, the adherents of the White Rose
were in dismay and consternation. Every man became
suspicious of his neighbor; and the duke was
driven to the conclusion that he must submit to circumstances.
No prospect of safety appearing but
in flight, York, with his second son, the ill-fated Earl
of Rutland, departed into Wales, and thence went to
Ireland; while Salisbury and Warwick, with the
duke's eldest son, Edward, escaped to Devonshire,
bought a ship at Exmouth, sailed to Guernsey, and
then passed over to Calais.

The king, on finding that his enemies had fled,
became very bold; and having spoiled the town and
castle of Ludlow, and taken the Duchess of York
prisoner, he called a Parliament. As measures were
to be taken to extinguish the Yorkists, no temporal
peer, unless known as a stanch adherent of the Red
Rose, received a summons; and Coventry was selected
as the scene of revenge; for, since the unfortunate
result of the Commission at Guildhall, the
queen looked upon London as no place for the execution
of those projects on which she had set her
heart. Away from the metropolis, however, Margaret[Pg 87]
found herself in a position to do as she pleased;
and at Coventry Bloreheath was fearfully avenged.
With little regard to law, and still less regard to
prudence, the most violent courses were pursued:
York, Salisbury, Warwick, and their friends, were
declared traitors; and their estates, being confiscated,
were bestowed on the queen's favorites. The chiefs
of the White Rose appeared utterly ruined; and
England was once more at the feet of "The Foreign
Woman."



[Pg 88]




CHAPTER X.

THE BATTLE OF NORTHAMPTON.


In the month of June, 1460, while the Duke of
York was in Ireland, while Margaret of Anjou was
with her feeble husband at Coventry, and while
Henry Holland, Duke of Exeter, York's son-in-law,
was, as lord high admiral, guarding the Channel
with a strong fleet, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick,
sailed from Calais for the shores of England.
It was in vain that Exeter endeavored to do his
duty as admiral; for on the sea as on the land, "The
Stout Earl" was a favorite hero, and the sailors refused
to haul an anchor or hoist a sail to prevent
his landing. At Sandwich he safely set foot on English
ground, and prepared to strike a shattering
blow at the house of Lancaster.

Warwick was accompanied by the Earl of Salisbury
and the Earl of March; but the army with
which he came to change the dynasty did not consist
of more than fifteen hundred men. The earl,
however, was not dismayed at the weakness of his
force. Indeed, his own great name was a tower of
strength; and when, on landing, he proclaimed that
his motive for taking up arms was to deliver his[Pg 89]
countrymen from oppression, and to maintain the
ancient laws and liberties of England, he knew that
the people would rally around his banner. Ere this,
the White Rose, in addition to being the emblem of
hereditary right, had become identified with the
cause of civil and religious freedom.

The earl's confidence in the people of England was
not misplaced. As he marched toward London, the
fighting men of Kent and of all the south flocked to
his standard, and on reaching Blackheath he was at
the head of thirty thousand men. As the patrician
hero entered the capital he was hailed with enthusiasm,
and cheered with the hope of crowning his
enterprise with success.

The king and queen were still at Coventry when
informed of Warwick's landing, and Margaret lost
no time in taking measures to resist the Yorkist invasion.
Money was borrowed from the Lancastrian
clergy and nobles, and troops, under Percies, Staffords,
Beauforts, Talbots, and Beaumonts, gathered
rapidly to the royal standard. The respect which,
on his heroic father's account, people still entertained
for Henry, and the fear with which Margaret inspired
them, were powerful motives; and a great
army having been assembled, the Lancastrian king
and his haughty spouse, accompanied by Somerset
and Buckingham, removed to Northampton, and took
up their quarters in the Friary.

[Pg 90]

Meanwhile, leaving his father in London to defend
the city and besiege the Tower, still held for the
king by Lord Scales, Warwick marched through the
midland counties. Having taken up a position between
Towcester and Northampton, he sent the Bishop
of Salisbury to the king with pacific overtures.
The bishop returned without satisfaction, and Warwick,
having thrice ineffectually attempted to obtain
an audience of the king, gave the Lancastrians notice
to prepare for battle.

The queen was not less willing than the earl to
try conclusions. Believing the Lancastrians equal
to an encounter with the army of Warwick, she addressed
her partisans, and encouraged them with
promises of honors and rewards. Confident in their
strength, she ordered them to cross the Nene; and,
Lord Grey de Ruthin leading the van, the royal
army passed through the river, and encamped hard
by the Abbey of Delapré in the meadows to the
south of the town. There the Lancastrians encompassed
themselves with high banks and deep trenches;
and, having fortified their position with piles, and
sharp stakes, and artillery, they awaited the approach
of the Yorkist foe.

Warwick was not the man to keep his enemies long
waiting under such circumstances. After charging
his soldiers to strike down every knight and noble,
but to spare the common men, he prepared for the[Pg 91]
encounter; and, ere the morning of the 9th of July       it
was gloomy and wet       dawned on the towers
and turrets of the ancient town on the winding
Nene, his army was in motion. Setting their faces
northward, the Yorkists passed the cross erected two
centuries earlier in memory of Eleanor of Castile,
and in feudal array advanced upon the foe       "The
Stout Earl" towering in front, and Edward of March,
York's youthful heir, following with his father's
banner.[5]

At news of Warwick's approach, the Lancastrian
chiefs aroused themselves to activity, donned their
mail, mounted their steeds, set their men in battle
order, and then alighted to fight on foot. The king,
in his tent, awaited the issue of the conflict; but
Margaret of Anjou repaired to an elevated situation,
and thither carried her son, to witness the fight.
Her hopes were doubtless high, for gallant looked
the army that was to do battle in her cause, and
well provided were the Lancastrians with the artillery
which had, in the previous autumn, rendered
the Yorkists so formidable at Ludlow.

[Pg 92]

By seven o'clock the Yorkists assailed the intrenched
camp at Delapré, and the war-cries of the
Lancastrian leaders answered the shouts of Warwick
and March. At first the contest was vigorously
maintained; but, unfortunately for the queen's hopes,
the rain had rendered the artillery incapable of doing
the service that had been anticipated. In spite
of this disheartening circumstance, the warriors of
the Red Rose bravely met their antagonists, and both
Yorkists and Lancastrians fought desperately and
well. But, in the heat of action, Lord Grey de
Ruthin, betraying his trust, deserted to the enemy.
Consternation thereupon fell upon the king's army,
and the Yorkists having, with the aid of Lord Grey's
soldiers, got within the intrenchments, wrought fearful
havoc. The conflict was, nevertheless, maintained
with obstinacy till nine o'clock; but after
two hours of hard fighting the king's men were seen
flying in all directions, and many, while attempting
to cross the Nene, were drowned in its waters.

In consequence of Warwick's order to spare the
commons, the slaughter fell chiefly on the knights
and nobles. The Duke of Buckingham, the Earl
of Shrewsbury, Thomas Percy, Lord Egremont, and
John, Viscount Beaumont, were among the slain.
Somerset narrowly escaped, and fled after the queen
in the direction of North Wales.

When intelligence of Warwick's victory reached[Pg 93]
London, the populace broke loose from all restraint.
Lord Scales, who, while keeping the Tower, had incurred
their hatred, disguised himself and endeavored
to escape. The watermen, however, recognized
him, and, notwithstanding his threescore years, cut
off his head and cast the body carelessly on the sands.
Thomas Thorpe, one of the barons of the Exchequer,
met a similar fate. While attempting to fly, he
was captured and committed to the Tower; but afterward
he was taken possession of by the mob, and
executed at Highgate. With such scenes enacting
before their eyes, the citizens recognized the necessity
of a settled government; and the adherents of
the White Rose intimated to their chief the expediency
of his immediate return from Ireland.

King Henry, after the defeat of his adherents at
Northampton, was found in his tent, lamenting the
slaughter. As at St. Albans, he was treated by the
victors with respectful compassion, and by them conducted,
with the utmost deference, to London.



[Pg 94]




CHAPTER XI.

YORK'S CLAIM TO THE CROWN.


On the 7th of October, 1460, a Parliament, summoned
in King Henry's name, met at Westminster,
in the Painted Chamber, for centuries regarded with
veneration as the place where St. Edward had
breathed his last, and with admiration on account
of the pictures representing incidents of the Confessor's
life and canonization, executed by command
of the third Henry to adorn the walls.

On this occasion the king sat in the chair of state;
and Warwick's brother, George Neville, Bishop of
Exeter, who, though not yet thirty, had been appointed
chancellor, opened the proceedings with a
notable declamation, taking for his text, Congregate
populum, sanctificate ecclesiam. The Houses then entered
upon business, repealed all the acts passed at
Coventry, and declared that the Parliament there
held had not been duly elected.

While this was going on, the Duke of York, who
had landed at Chester, came toward London; and
three days after the meeting of Parliament, accompanied
by a splendid retinue, all armed and mounted,
he entered the capital with banners flying, trumpets[Pg 95]
sounding, and a naked sword carried before him.
Riding along with princely dignity, the duke dismounted
at Westminster, and proceeded to the House
of Lords. Walking straight to the throne, he laid
his hand on the cloth of gold, and, pausing, looked
round, as if to read the sentiments of the peers in
the faces. At that moment the Archbishop of Canterbury,
who had been with Henry, entered the
house, and made the usual reverence to the duke.

"Will not my Lord of York go and pay his respects
to the king?" asked the archbishop.

"I know no one," answered York, coloring, "to
whom I owe that title."

The archbishop, on hearing the duke's answer,
went back to the king; and York, following, took
possession of the palace. Then, returning to the
house, and standing on the steps of the throne, he
claimed the crown of England as heir of Lionel of
Clarence. When the duke concluded his speech, the
peers sat motionless as graven images; and perceiving
that not a word was uttered nor a whisper exchanged,
York sharply asked them to deliberate.
"Think of this matter, my lords," said he; "I have
taken my course, take yours."

The duke left the house in some chagrin, and
the peers took his request into consideration. After
discussing the claim to the crown as calmly
as if it had been an ordinary peerage case, they[Pg 96]
resolved that the question should be argued by counsel
at the bar.

Most of the lords were under essential obligations
to the house of Lancaster, and therefore in no haste
to take York's claim into consideration. When a
week elapsed, therefore, the duke deemed it politic
to send a formal demand of the crown, and to request
an immediate answer. The peers, somewhat
startled, replied that they refused justice to no man,
but in this case could decide nothing without the
advice and consent of the king. Henry was consulted;
and he recommended that the judges should
be summoned to give their opinion. These legal
functionaries, however, declined to meddle with a
matter so dangerous, and the peers were under the
necessity of proceeding without the aid of their learning
and experience. The duke was then heard by
his counsel; and, an order having been made "that
every man might freely and indifferently speak his
mind without fear of impeachment," the question
was debated several days.

All this time York lodged in the palace of Westminster,
where Henry then was, but refused to see
his royal kinsman, or to hold any communication
with him till the peers had decided on the justice of
his claim; he knew no one, he said, to whom he
owed the title of king.

At length the peers arrived at a decision; and[Pg 97]
the youthful chancellor, by order of the house, pronounced
judgment. It was to the effect that Richard
Plantagenet had made out his claim; but that,
in consideration of Henry having from infancy worn
the crown, he should be allowed to continue king
for life, and that York, who meanwhile was to hold
the reins of government, should ascend the throne
after his royal kinsman's death. This compromise
of a delicate dispute seemed to please both parties.
On the vigil of the feast of All Saints, York and two
of his sons appeared in Parliament, and took an oath
to abide by the decision; on All Saints Day the
heir of John of Gaunt and the heir of Lionel of
Clarence rode together to St. Paul's in token of
friendship; and on the Saturday following the duke
was, by sound of trumpet, proclaimed Protector of
the realm and heir to the crown.

The king appeared quite unconcerned at the turn
which affairs had taken, and York had no apprehensions
of a man who was never happy but when
giving himself up to devotional exercises. The
duke, however, was not indifferent to the enmity
of Margaret of Anjou, and he felt anxious to secure
himself against her hostility. He therefore
sent a summons to bring her son without delay to
Westminster, intending in case of disobedience to
banish her from among a people on whom she had
brought so many misfortunes. The Protector, it[Pg 98]
soon appeared, had under-estimated the resources,
the energy, the terrible enthusiasm of the daughter
of King René. He sent his messengers, as it were,
to hunt a wild-cat, and he found, to his cost, that
they had roused a fierce tigress.



[Pg 99]




CHAPTER XII.

THE QUEEN'S FLIGHT AND RETURN.


When Margaret of Anjou, from the rising ground
at Northampton, saw her knights and nobles bite
the dust, and descried the banner of Richard Plantagenet
borne in triumph through the broken ranks
of the Lancastrian army, she mounted in haste and
fled with her son toward the bishopric of Durham.
Changing her mind, however, the unfortunate queen
drew her rein, turned aside, and made for North
Wales.

The way was beset with danger. As Margaret
was passing through Lancashire she was robbed of
her jewels; and while, with bitter feelings, pursuing
her flight through Cheshire she was attacked by a
retainer of Sir William Stanley. Having escaped
these perils, and been joined by Somerset, the fair
Anjouite sought refuge in Harleck Castle, which
had been built on the site of an ancient British
fortress by the first Edward, and which was held
for that mighty monarch's feeble descendant by a
Welsh captain who rejoiced in the name of Davydd
ap Jefan ap Einion.

The Castle of Harleck stood on a lofty cliff, the[Pg 100]
base of which was then washed by the ocean, though
now a marshy tract of ground intervenes. From
the sea, with such a rock to scale, the strong-hold
was well-nigh impregnable; while on the land side
it was defended by massive walls, by a large fosse,
and by round towers and turrets, which covered every
approach. Owen Glendower had, during four
years, maintained the place against the fifth Henry;
and the sturdy "Davydd" would not have shrunk
from defending it against a Yorkist army, even if led
by Warwick in person.

At Harleck Margaret passed months, brooding
over the past, uncertain as to the present, and anxious
about the future. At times, indeed, she must
have forgotten her misfortunes, as, from the battlements
of the castle, she gazed with the eye of a
poetess over the intervening mountains to where the
peaks of Snowdon seem to mingle with the clouds.
At length she was startled by intelligence of the
settlement made by Parliament, and by a summons
from York, as Protector, to appear at Westminster
with her son.

Margaret might well crimson with shame and
anger. The terms on which the dispute between
York and Lancaster had been compromised recalled
all the injurious rumors as to the birth of her son;
and her maternal feelings were shocked at the exclusion
of the boy-prince from the throne he had[Pg 101]
been born to inherit.[6] Submission was, under these
circumstances, impossible to such a woman. She
was not yet thirty, decidedly too young to abandon
hope; and she was conscious of having already, in
seasons of danger, exhibited that energy which is
hope in action. The idea of yet trampling in the
dust the three magnates by whom she had been
humbled, took possession of her mind; and, unaided
save by beauty, eloquence, and those accomplishments
which, fifteen years earlier, had made her
famous at the courts of Europe, she started for the
north with the determination of regaining the crown
which she had already found so thorny. The distressed
queen embarked on the Menai; and her
destination was Scotland.

One day in the autumn of 1460, James, King of
Scots, the second of his name, while attempting to
wrest Roxburgh Castle from the English, was killed
by the bursting of a cannon, and succeeded by his
son, a boy in his seventh year. The obsequies of[Pg 102]
the deceased monarch were scarcely celebrated,
when intelligence reached the Scottish court that
Margaret of Anjou had, with her son, arrived at
Dumfries; that she had met with a reception befitting
a royal personage; and that she had taken up
her residence in the College of Lincluden.

Mary of Gueldres, the widowed Queen of Scots,
was about Margaret's own age. Moreover, Mary
was a princess of great beauty, of masculine talent,
and of the blood royal of France. Surrounded by
the iron barons of a rude country, her position was
not quite so pleasant as a bed of roses; and she
could hardly help sympathizing with the desolate
condition of her distant kinswoman. Hastening
with her son to Dumfries, she held a conference
that lasted for twelve days.

At the conference of Lincluden every thing went
smoothly. Much wine was consumed. A close
friendship was formed between the queens. A
marriage was projected between the Prince of
Wales and a princess of Scotland. Margaret's
spirit rose high; her hopes revived; and encouraged
by promises of aid, she resolved on no less
desperate an adventure than marching to London
and rescuing her husband from the grasp of "the
Triumvirate."

The enterprise decided on, no time was lost. An
army was mustered in the frontier counties with a[Pg 103]
rapidity which, it would seem, York and his friends
had never regarded as possible. The great barons
of the north, however, had never manifested any
tenderness for the White Rose; and they remembered
with indignation that hitherto their southern
peers had carried every thing before them. Eager
to vindicate their importance, and inspired by Margaret
with an enthusiasm almost equal to her own,
the Nevilles of Westmoreland, the Percies of Northumberland,
and the Cliffords of Cumberland, summoned
their fighting men, and at the same time endeavored,
by promises of plunder south of the Trent,
to allure the foraying clans to their standard.

The Borderers boasted that their property was in
their swords; and they were seldom slow to ride
when the prospect of booty was presented to their
imaginations. They went to church as seldom as
the twenty-ninth of February comes into the calendar,
and never happened to comprehend that there
was a seventh commandment. When on forays,
they took every thing that was not too heavy; and
were sometimes far from satisfied with the exception.
Such men hailed with delight the prospect of plundering
the rich South. From peels and castellated
houses they came, wearing rusting armor, and mounted
on lean steeds, but steady of heart, stout of hand,
and ready, without thought of fear, to charge against
knight or noble, no matter how proof his mail or[Pg 104]
high his renown in arms. The Borderers cared nothing
for York or Lancaster; and would have fought
as readily for the White Rose as the Red. But the
spoil south of the Trent was a noble prize; and they
gathered to the queen's standard like eagles to their
prey.

Finding herself at the head of eighteen thousand
men, Margaret of Anjou pressed boldly southward.
Even the season was such as would have daunted
an ordinary woman. When operations commenced,
the year 1460 was about to expire; the grass had
withered; the streams were darkened with the rains
of December; the leaves had fallen; and the wind
whistled through the naked branches of the trees.
Margaret, far from shrinking, defied all hardships;
and the spectacle of a queen, so young and beautiful,
enduring fatigue and daring danger, excited the
admiration and increased loyalty of her adherents.
With every inclination to execute a signal revenge,
she appeared before the gates of York; and marched
from that city toward Sandal Castle.



[Pg 105]




CHAPTER XIII.

THE ANJOUITE'S VENGEANCE.


As the autumn of 1460 was deepening into winter,
a rumor reached London that Margaret of Anjou
was raising troops on the borders of England. The
Duke of York, though not seriously alarmed, was
apprehensive of an insurrection in the north; and,
marching from the metropolis, with an army of five
thousand men, he, on Christmas-eve, arrived at Sandal
Castle, which stood on an eminence that slopes
down toward the town of Wakefield. Finding that
his enemies were so much more numerous than he
had anticipated, the Protector saw the propriety of
remaining in his strong-hold till re-enforced by his
son, who was recruiting in the marches of Wales.

The fact, however, was that Margaret had no intention
of allowing Duke Richard to profit by delay.
Marching to Wakefield Green, she challenged
him to the field, and ridiculed the idea of a man having
aspired to a crown who was frightened to encounter
an army led by a woman. Well aware,
however, that the battle is not always to the strong,
Margaret did not altogether trust in numerical superiority.
Determined to secure victory, she formed[Pg 106]
an ambuscade on either side: one under Lord Clifford,
the other under the Earl of Wiltshire; while
to Somerset she intrusted the command of her main
army.

Meanwhile York called a council of war: Salisbury
and the other chiefs of the White Rose who
were present strongly objected to hazarding a battle;
and David Hall, an old and experienced warrior,
implored the duke to remain within the walls
of Sandal. But York considered that his honor
was concerned in fighting; and, addressing himself
to Hall in familiar phrase, he expressed the sentiments
by which he was animated.

"Ah! Davy, Davy," said the duke, "hast thou
loved me so long, and wouldst now have me dishonored?
No man ever saw me keep fortress when I
was Regent of Normandy, when the dauphin, with
his puissance, came to besiege me; but, like a man,
and not like a bird inclosed in a cage, I issued, and
fought with mine enemies; to their loss (I thank
God), and ever to my honor. If I have not kept
myself within walls for fear of a great and strong
prince, nor hid my face from any living mortal,
wouldst thou that I should incarcerate and shut myself
up for dread of a scolding woman, whose weapons
are her tongue and nails? All men would cry
wonder, and report dishonor, that a woman made
a dastard of me, whom no man could ever, to this[Pg 107]
day, report as a coward. And, surely, my mind
is rather to die with honor than to live with shame.
Their numbers do not appall me. Assuredly I will
fight with them, if I fight alone. Therefore, advance
my banners, in the name of God and St.
George!"

Seeing the duke determined to hazard a field,
Salisbury and the other captains arrayed their men
for battle; and the Yorkists, sallying from the castle,
descended to meet the foe on Wakefield Green.
The duke supposed that the troops under Somerset
were all with whom he had to contend; and the
brave warrior, now in his fiftieth year, advanced
fearlessly to the encounter. Never was Plantagenet
more completely deceived. When between Sandal
Castle and the town of Wakefield, York was suddenly
assailed, by Clifford on the right hand, and
by Wiltshire on the left; but, though environed on
every side, the duke did not yield to fate without
a desperate struggle. On both sides, the soldiers
fought with savage fury; and the Yorkists, conscious
of superior discipline, were for a while hopeful
of victory. At a critical moment, however,
Margaret brought up a body of Borderers, and ordered
them to attack the Yorkists in the rear; and
the effect was instantaneous. The northern prickers
laid their spears in rest, spurred their lean steeds,
and charged the warriors of the White Rose with a[Pg 108]
vigor that defied resistance. The victory was complete;
and of five thousand men, whom York had
brought into the field, nearly three thousand were
stretched on the slippery sod. The bold duke was
among the first who fell. With him were slain his
faithful squire, David Hall, and many lords and gentlemen
of the south       among whom were Sir Thomas
Neville, Salisbury's son; and William Bonville, Lord
Harrington, the husband of Katherine Neville, Salisbury's
daughter.

An incident as melancholy as any connected with
the Wars of the Roses now occurred. York's son,
Edmund, Earl of Rutland, being in the castle of
Sandal, had gone with his tutor, Sir Robert Aspall,
to witness the fight. They dreaded no danger, for
Aspall was a priest, and Rutland was a fair boy of
twelve, and innocent as a lamb. Seeing, however,
that the fortune of the day was against York, the
tutor hurried the young earl from the field; but as
they were crossing the bridge, Lord Clifford rode up
and asked the boy's name. The young earl fell on
his knees, and, being too much agitated to speak,
implored mercy by holding up his hands.

"Spare him," said the tutor; "he is a prince's
son, and may hereafter do you good."

"York's son!" exclaimed Clifford, eying the boy
savagely. "By God's blood, thy father slew mine,
and so will I thee and all thy kin."

[Pg 109]

[Pg 110]CLIFFORD STABBING RUTLAND.


[Pg 111]
Deaf to the tutor's prayers and entreaties, "the
black-faced lord" plunged his dagger into Rutland's
heart; and as the boy expired turned to the priest,
who stood mute with horror. "Go," said the murderer,
"bear to his mother and his brother tidings
of what you have heard and seen."

After thus imbruing his hands in the blood of an
innocent boy, Clifford went in search of the corpse
of York. Having severed the duke's head from the
body, and put a crown of paper on the brow of the
dead man, and fixed the head on a pole, he presented
the ghastly trophy to the queen. "Madam,"
said Clifford, mockingly, "your war is done; here I
bring your king's ransom." Margaret of Anjou
laughed; the Lancastrian lords around her laughed
in chorus; there was much jesting on the occasion.
"Many," says Hall, "were glad of other men's
deaths, not knowing that their own was near at
hand;" and the chronicler might have added that
others lived through many dreary years to rue the
jesting of that day.

One of the hated "Triumvirate" was now no
longer alive to annoy the queen; and she was yet
to have another victim. Thomas Neville, the son
of Salisbury, was, as has been stated, among the
slain; but the old earl, though wounded, had left
the field. He was too dangerous a foe, however, to
be allowed by Clifford to escape. Keenly pursued,[Pg 112]
he was taken during the night, carried to Pontefract
Castle, and there executed. Margaret ordered Salisbury's
head, and those of York and Rutland, to be
set over the gates of York, as a warning to all Englishmen
not to interfere with her sovereign will.
"Take care," she said to her myrmidons, "to leave
room for the head of my Lord of Warwick, for he
will soon come to keep his friends company."

Glowing with victory, and confident that her enterprise
would be crowned with triumph, the queen,
taking the great north road, pursued her march toward
the capital. Her progress was for a time unopposed.
On approaching St. Albans, however, she
learned that the Earl of Warwick and the Duke of
Norfolk had left London to intercept her; that they
had taken possession of St. Albans; that they had
filled the streets of the town with archers, and posted
their army on the hills to the southeast.

Margaret was not dismayed at the intelligence
that such formidable foes were in her way. On the
contrary, she intimated her intention of passing
through St. Albans in spite of their opposition; but
did not deem it safe to trust to force alone. One
of the ladies of her court       so runs the story       happened
to have, in other days, interested Warwick,
and had not quite lost her influence with "The
Stout Earl." Upon this dame       the daughter of
Sir Richard Woodville and the wife of John Grey[Pg 113]
of Groby       devolved the duty of playing the spy;
and accordingly she repaired to Warwick under the
pretense of asking some favor. The lady was cunning
enough to act her part with discretion; and
she, doubtless, brought her royal mistress intelligence
which gave the Lancastrians courage to proceed.

It was the morning of the 17th of February, 1461,
when the van of the queen's army advanced to force
their way through St. Albans. At first the attempt
was unsuccessful; and the Lancastrians were met
by Warwick's bowmen with a flight of arrows that
caused them to fall back from the market-place.
Undaunted by this repulse, Margaret persevered;
and, driving the archers before her, she brought her
soldiers into action with the main body of the Yorkists
in a field called Bernard's Heath.

At this point the Lancastrians found their task
more easy than they could have anticipated. For
the third time during the wars of the Roses occurred
an instance of desertion in the face of the enemy.
At Ludlow, Andrew Trollope had left the Yorkists;
at Northampton, Lord Grey de Ruthin had abandoned
the Lancastrians; and now Lovelace, who at
the head of the Kentish men led Warwick's van,
deserted the great earl in the hour of need. This
circumstance placed the victory in Margaret's power;
and a dashing charge made by John Grey of[Pg 114]
Groby, at the head of the Lancastrian cavalry, decided
the day in favor of the Red Rose. A running
fight was, nevertheless, kept up over the undulating
ground between St. Albans and the little town of
Barnet; and, a last stand having in vain been made
on Barnet Common, Warwick was fain to retreat
with the remnants of his army.

So unexpected had been the queen's victory, and
so sudden the earl's discomfiture, that the captive
king was left in solitude. However, Lord Bonville,
grandfather of the warrior who fell at Wakefield,
and Sir Thomas Kyriel, renowned in the wars of
France, went to the royal tent, and in courteous language
expressed their regret at leaving him unattended.
Henry, entreating them to remain, gave
them a distinct promise that in doing so they should
incur no danger; and after accepting the royal word
as a pledge for their personal safety they consented,
and advised the king to intimate to the victors that
he would gladly join them.

A message was accordingly dispatched; and several
Lancastrian lords came to convey Henry of
Windsor to the presence of his terrible spouse. The
monk-king found Margaret of Anjou and the Prince
of Wales in Lord Clifford's tent, and, having expressed
his gratification at their meeting, rewarded the
fidelity of his adherents by knighting thirty of them
at the village of Colney. Among these were the[Pg 115]
Prince of Wales, and John Grey of Groby, the warrior
who had broken the Yorkists' ranks, and who,
dying of his wounds a few days later, left a widow
destined to bring countless miseries on the royal race
whose chiefs had so long ruled England. After the
ceremony of knighting his partisans, Henry repaired
to the Abbey of St. Albans and returned thanks for
the victory.

While Henry was occupied with devotional exercises,
the queen was unfortunately guilty of an outrage
which, even if she had been in other respects
faultless, must have for ever associated crime with
the name of Margaret of Anjou. The Lord Bonville
and Sir Thomas Kyriel had consented, as we
have seen, from motives of compassion and romantic
honor, to remain with Henry; and the king had on
his part given a distinct promise that no evil should
befall them. But by the queen and her captains no
respect was paid to Henry; in fact, much less decorum
was observed toward him by the Lancastrians
than by the Yorkists. At all events Margaret, exhibiting
the utmost disregard for her husband's promise,
ordered a scaffold to be erected at St. Albans;
and, in defiance of all faith and honor, Lord Bonville
and Sir Thomas Kyriel died by the hands of
the executioner.

Meanwhile, Margaret's adherents were taking a
sure way to render her cause unpopular. Ere[Pg 116]
marching toward London the men of the north had,
as the price of their allegiance to the Red Rose,
covenanted to have the spoil south of the Trent;
and, resolved not to return home empty-handed, they
had forayed with so much energy as to spread terror
wherever they went. At St. Albans their rapacity
knew no limits. Not only did they plunder the
town with an utter disregard to the rights of property,
but stripped the abbey with a sacrilegious hardihood
which rapidly converted the head of that great
monastic house from a zealous Lancastrian to a violent
partisan of the White Rose.

The report of the lawless scenes enacted at St.
Albans was carried to London, and the citizens, who
believed that the queen had marked them as objects
of her vengeance, were impressed with a sense of
danger, and rather eager to win back her favor.
When, therefore, the northern army lay at Barnet,
and Margaret sent to demand provisions, the mayor
hastened to forward some cart-loads of "lenten stuff"
for the use of her camp. The populace, however,
exhibited a courage which their wealthier neighbors
did not possess, and rising in a mass at Cripplegate
stopped the carts, and forcibly prevented the provisions
leaving the city. The mayor, in alarm, sent
the recorder to the king's council, and moreover interested
Lady Scales and the Duchess of Bedford to
intercede with the queen, and represent the impolicy[Pg 117]
of exasperating the commons at such a crisis. This
led to another scene of lawless outrage. Some lords
of the council, with four hundred horsemen, headed
by Sir Baldwin Fulford, were sent to investigate
matters, and attempted to enter London at Cripplegate.
Again, however, the populace fought for the
White Rose; and the Lancastrian horsemen, being
repulsed, plundered the northern suburbs in retaliation,
and left matters infinitely worse than they had
previously appeared.

While affairs were in this posture       Margaret's
heart beating high with the pride of victory       a
price set on the head of Edward of York       the
Lancastrian lords cherishing the prospect of vengeance       "the
wealth of London looking pale, knowing
itself in danger from the northern army"       and
the citizens apprehensive of being given over to the
tender mercies of Grahams and Armstrongs       from
Mortimer's Cross there arrived news of battle and
bloodshed. The citizens resumed their feelings of
security; the wealth of London appeared once more
safe from huge Borderers; and Margaret of Anjou,
forcibly reminded that Edward Plantagenet and
Richard Neville yet lived to avenge their sires, prepared
to return to "Northumberland, the nursery
of her strength."



[Pg 118]




CHAPTER XIV.

A PLANTAGENET AND THE TUDORS.


At the opening of the year 1461, a princely personage,
of graceful figure and distinguished air, rather
more than twenty years of age, and rather more
than six feet in height, might have been seen moving
about the city of Gloucester, whose quiet streets,
with old projecting houses, and whose Gothic cathedral,
with stained oriel window and lofty tower,
have little changed in aspect since that period.
The youthful stranger, who was wonderfully handsome,
had golden hair flowing straight to his shoulders,
a long oval countenance, a rich but clear and
delicate complexion, broad shoulders, and a form
almost faultless. Perhaps his eye roved with too
eager admiration after the fair damsels who happened
to cross his path; but it was not for want of
more serious subjects with which to occupy his attention;
for the tall, handsome youth was Edward
Plantagenet, Earl of March; and he had been sent
to the Welsh Marches to recruit soldiers to fight the
battles of the White Rose.

Edward of York was a native of Rouen. In that
city he was born in 1441, while his father ruled[Pg 119]
Normandy. At an early age, however, he was
brought to England, to be educated in Ludlow Castle,
under the auspices of Sir Richard Croft, a warlike
Marchman, who had married a widow of one
of the Mortimers. Under the auspices of Croft and
of his spouse, who, at Ludlow, was known as "The
Lady Governess," Edward grew up a handsome
boy, and was, from the place of his birth, called
"The Rose of Rouen," as his mother had been
called "The Rose of Raby." Early plunged into
the wars of the Roses, the heir of York never acquired
any thing like learning, but became a warrior
of experience in his teens; and, when at Northampton,
bearing his father's banner, he exhibited a
spirit which inspired the partisans of York with
high hopes.

When Edward received intelligence that, on
Wakefield Green, his father, the Duke of York,
had fallen in battle against Margaret of Anjou, and
that his brother, the Earl of Rutland, had been barbarously
murdered by Lord Clifford, the prince, in
the spirit of that age, vowed vengeance, and applied
himself with energy to execute his vow. Doubtless,
other objects than mere revenge presented themselves
to his imagination. As the grandson of Anne Mortimer,
he was the legitimate heir of England's kings;
and he had not, during his brief career, shown any
of that political moderation which had prevented[Pg 120]
his father plucking the crown from the feeble
Henry.

The recruiting expedition on which Edward had
gone, accompanied by a gallant squire, named William
Hastings, said to derive his descent, through
knights and nobles, from one of the famous sea
kings, was, at first, much less successful than anticipated.
The Marchmen seemed disinclined to
stir in a dynastic quarrel which they did not quite
understand. But a report that York had fallen in
battle, and that Rutland had been murdered in cold
blood, produced a sudden change. Men who before
appeared careless about taking up arms rushed to
the Yorkist standard; and the retainers of the
house of Mortimer, on hearing that their valiant
lord was slain, appeared, with sad hearts and stern
brows, demanding to be led against the murderers.

Edward was already, in imagination, a conqueror.
After visiting Shrewsbury, and other towns on the
Severn, he found himself at the head of twenty-three
thousand men, ready to avenge his father's fall, and
vindicate his own rights. At the head of this force
he took his way toward London, trusting to unite
with Warwick, and, at one blow, crush the power
of the fierce Anjouite ere she reached the capital.
An unexpected circumstance prevented Edward's
hope from being so speedily realized.

Among the Welsh soldiers who fought at Agincourt,[Pg 121]
and assisted in repelling the furious charge of
the Duke of Alençon, was Owen Tudor, the son of
a brewer at Beaumaris. In recognition of his courage,
Owen was named a squire of the body to the
hero of that day, and, a few years later, became
clerk of the wardrobe to the hero's widow. It happened
that Owen, who was a handsome man, pleased
the eye of Katherine de Valois; and one day, when
he stumbled over her dress, while dancing for the
diversion of the court, she excused the awkwardness
with a readiness which first gave her ladies a suspicion
that she was not altogether insensible to his
manly beauty. As time passed on, Katherine united
her fate with his; and, in secret, she became the
mother of several children.

When the sacrifice which the widowed queen had
made became known, shame and grief carried her to
the grave; and Humphrey of Gloucester, then Protector,
sent Owen to the Tower. He afterward regained
his liberty, but without being acknowledged
by the young king as a father-in-law. Indeed, of a
marriage between the Welsh soldier and the daughter
of a Valois and widow of a Plantagenet no evidence
exists; but when Edmund and Jasper, the
sons of Katherine, grew up, Henry gave to one the
Earldom of Richmond, and to the other that of
Pembroke. Richmond died about the time when
the wars of the Roses commenced. Pembroke lived[Pg 122]
to enact a conspicuous part in the long and sanguinary
struggle.

When the Lancastrian army, flushed with victory,
was advancing from Wakefield toward London, Margaret
of Anjou, hearing that Edward of York was
on the Marches of Wales, resolved to send a force
under Jasper Tudor to intercept him; and Jasper,
proud of the commission, undertook to bring the
young Plantagenet, dead or alive, to her feet. With
this view he persuaded his father to take part in the
adventure, and Owen Tudor once more drew the
sword which, in years gone by, he had wielded for
the House of Lancaster.

Edward was on his march toward London when
he heard that Jasper and other Welshmen were on
his track. The prince was startled; but the idea
of an heir of the blood and name of the great Edwards
flying before Owen Tudor and his son was
not pleasant; and, moreover, it was impolitic to
place himself between two Lancastrian armies. Considering
these circumstances, Edward turned upon
his pursuers, and met them at Mortimer's Cross, in
the neighborhood of Hereford.

It was the morning of the 2d of February       Candlemas
Day       and Edward was arraying his
men for the encounter, when he perceived that the
"orb of day" appeared like three suns, which all
joined together as he looked. In those days the[Pg 123]
appearance of three suns in the sky was regarded as
a strange prodigy; and Edward either believed, or
affected to believe, that the phenomenon was an
omen of good fortune. Encouraging his soldiers
with the hope of victory, he set fiercely upon the
enemy.

The Tudors, whose heads had been turned by unmerited
prosperity, were by no means prepared for
defeat. Owen, with whom a queen-dowager had
united her fate, and Jasper, on whom a king had
conferred an earldom, were too much intoxicated to
perceive the danger of giving chase to the heir of
the Plantagenets. Not till Edward turned savagely
to bay did they perceive that, instead of starting a
hare, they had roused a lion.

At length the armies joined battle, and a fierce
conflict took place. Edward, exhibiting that skill
which afterward humbled the most potent of England's
barons, saw thousands of his foes hurled to
the ground; and Jasper, forgetful of his heraldic
precept, that death is better than disgrace, left his
followers to their fate and fled from the field. Owen,
however, declined to follow his son's example. He
had fought at Agincourt, he remembered, and had
not learned to fly. His courage did not save the
Welsh adherents of Lancaster from defeat; and, in
spite of his efforts, he was taken prisoner with David
Lloyd, Morgan ap Reuther, and other Welshmen.

[Pg 124]

Edward had now a golden opportunity, by sparing
the vanquished, of setting a great example to his
adversaries. But the use which Margaret had made
of her victory at Wakefield could not be forgotten;
and it seemed to be understood that henceforth no
quarter was to be given in the Wars of the Roses.
Accordingly, Owen and his friends were conveyed
to Hereford, and executed in the market-place. The
old Agincourt soldier was buried in the chapel of
the Grey Friars' Church; but no monument was
erected by his regal descendants in memory of the
Celtic hero whose lucky stumble over a royal widow's
robes resulted in his sept exchanging the obscurity
of Beaumaris for the splendor of Windsor.



[Pg 125]




CHAPTER XV.

BEFORE TOWTON.


On the 3d of March, 1461, while Margaret of Anjou
was leading her army toward the Humber, and
the citizens of London were awakening from fearful
dreams of northern men plundering their warehouses
with lawless violence, and treating their women with
indelicate freedom, Edward of York entered the capital
at the head of his victorious army. Accompanied
by the Earl of Warwick, by whom he had
been joined at Chipping Norton, the conqueror of
the Tudors rode through the city, and was welcomed
with the utmost enthusiasm. It was long since
London had been the scene of such loyal excitement.
From Kent and Essex came crowds to gaze on the
handsome son of Richard, Duke of York; and many
were the predictions that, as a native of Rouen, Edward
would reconquer Normandy, and retrieve those
losses which, under the government of Margaret of
Anjou, the English had sustained on the Continent.

Whatever he might pretend, Edward had none
of the moderation that characterized his father, and
he was determined without delay to ascend the
throne, which he had been taught to consider his by[Pg 126]
hereditary right. Anxious, however, to have the
popular assent to the step he was about to take, the
heir of the Plantagenets resolved to test the loyalty
of the Londoners. With this object a grand review,
in St. John's Fields, was proclaimed by William Neville,
Lord Falconbridge; and the wealthy citizens,
as well as the multitude, assembled to witness the
military pageant. Suddenly availing himself of a
favorable moment, Warwick's brother, the Bishop
of Exeter, addressed the crowd on the great dynastic
dispute, and asked them plainly whether they
would any longer have Henry to reign over them.
"Nay, nay," answered the crowd. Warwick's uncle,
Lord Falconbridge, having then spoken in praise of
Edward's valor and wisdom, asked if they would
have him for king. "Yea, yea       King Edward,
King Edward," shouted the populace, with one accord,
cheering and clapping their hands.

The Yorkist chiefs were satisfied with the result
of their experiment in St. John's Fields; and next
day a great council was held at Baynard's Castle.
After due deliberation, the peers and prelates declared
that Henry, in joining the queen's army and
breaking faith with Parliament, had forfeited the
crown; and the heir of York, after riding in royal
state to Westminster, offered at St. Edward's shrine,
assumed the Confessor's crown, ascended the throne,
explained the nature of his claim, and harangued[Pg 127]
the people. His spirit and energy inspired the audience
with enthusiasm, and he was frequently interrupted
with shouts of "Long live King Edward."

On the day when the young Plantagenet took
possession of the English throne at Westminster, he
was proclaimed king in various parts of London.
Edward was not, however, so intoxicated with the
applause with which the men of the south had greeted
his arrival in the metropolis as to delude himself
into the idea that his triumph was complete. He
knew that the lords of the north would again rise
in arms for the Red Rose, and that battles must be
won, and fortresses taken, ere the crown of St. Edward
could sit easily on his head.

Nothing, however, could be gained by delay; and
Warwick was well aware of the danger of procrastination
at such a crisis. The young king and the
king-maker, therefore, resolved upon marching forthwith
against the Lancastrians, to achieve, as they
hoped, a crowning victory; and, having sent the
Duke of Norfolk to recruit in the provinces, they
made preparations to go in search of their foes.

No time was wasted. Indeed, within three days
of entering London, Warwick marched northward
with the van of the Yorkist army; and the infantry
having meanwhile followed, Edward, on the 12th of
March, buckled on his armor, mounted his war-steed,
and rode out of Bishopgate to conquer or die. By[Pg 128]
easy marches the royal warrior reached Pontefract,
memorable as the scene of the second Richard's murder;
and, having, while resting there, enjoyed the
satisfaction of seeing his army swell to the number
of forty-nine thousand, he dispatched Lord Fitzwalter,
with a band of tall men, to keep the passage
over the Aire at Ferrybridge.

Nor had Margaret failed to prepare for the inevitable
conflict. When, at St. Albans, the Lancastrian
queen found that her foes were still unsubdued,
she speedily bore back to the northern counties,
and commenced recruiting her army on the
banks of the Humber, the Trent, and the Tyne.
Her spirit, ever highest in the time of trouble, sustained
the courage of her adherents; and the men
of the north, who now, without entering into the
delicate questions of hereditary right and parliamentary
settlement, sympathized with the dethroned
queen, came from towers by the wayside, and shealings
on the moor, till around the Lancastrian banner
at York mustered an army of sixty thousand.

On hearing of Edward's approach the queen resolved
to remain, with Henry and the young prince,
at York, to await the issue of the battle impending.
But she could hardly dream of defeat as she inspected
that numerous army, headed by knights and nobles
arrayed in rich armor and mounted on prancing
steeds, who had gathered to her standard in the[Pg 129]
capital of the north. Somerset, Northumberland,
and Clifford, appeared in feudal pride, determined
at length to avenge the slaughter of their sires at St.
Albans; and the Duke of Exeter, with John, Lord
Neville, brother to the Earl of Westmoreland, and
Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon, without the death
of sires to avenge, came to fight for the Red Rose;
the first against his brother-in-law, King Edward,
the second against his kinsmen, the Lords Warwick
and Falconbridge, and the third against the house
of York, of which his father had been one of the
earliest adherents. Many other stanch Lancastrians,
bearing names celebrated in history and song,
had assembled; as Leo, Lord Welles, James Butler,
Earl of Wiltshire, Ralph, Lord Dacre of the north,
and Thomas, Lord De Roos, heir of that great Anglo-Norman
baron of the twelfth century, whose
effigy is still to be seen in the Temple Church.
Among the Percies, Beauforts, and Cliffords figured
Sir John Heron, of the Ford, a stalwart Borderer,
who, in his day, had laid lance in rest against the
Homes and Cranstouns; and Andrew Trollope, that
mighty man of war, whose betrayal of the Yorkists
at Ludlow had, for a year, delayed the exile of Margaret
of Anjou. Even a venerable lawyer and a
subtle churchman might have been seen in the Lancastrian
ranks; for Sir John Fortescue had left the
Court of King's Bench to fight for the cause which[Pg 130]
he believed to be that of truth and justice; and
John Morton had deserted the parsonage of Blokesworth
to win preferment, if possible, by the arm of
flesh. Such were the chiefs, devoted heart and hand
to the house of Lancaster, who, at the head of the
northern men, awaited the coming of the Yorkist
king and the king-maker.



[Pg 131]




CHAPTER XVI.

TOWTON FIELD.


With Margaret of Anjou heading a mighty army
at York, and Edward Plantagenet heading an army,
not assuredly so numerous, but perhaps not less
mighty, at Pontefract, a conflict could not long be
delayed. Nor, indeed, had the partisans of either
Rose any reason to shrink from an encounter. For,
while the Yorkist chiefs felt that nothing less than a
crowning triumph could save them from the vengeance
of the dethroned queen, the Lancastrian
lords were not less fully aware that nothing but a
decisive victory could insure to them their possessions
and restore to Henry his throne.

Learning that Edward was at Pontefract, and
anxious to prevent him passing the Aire, Margaret's
magnificent army moved from York. Formidable,
indeed, the Lancastrians must have looked as they
left the capital of the North, and marched southward;
Somerset figuring as commander-in-chief;
while Northumberland, aided by Andrew Trollope,
the great soldier of the Red Rose ranks, led the van;
and Clifford, with the hands that had been dyed in
Rutland's blood, reined in his prancing steed at the[Pg 132]
head of the light cavalry. Crossing the Wharfe, and
marching through Tadcaster, the queen's captains
posted their men to the south of Towton, a little
village some eight miles from York. In front of
their main body was a valley known as Towton
Dale; their right wing was protected by a cliff, and
their left by a marsh, which has since disappeared.

Somerset had hoped to keep the Aire between
him and the Yorkist foe; and the aspiring duke
was somewhat dismayed to hear that Lord Fitzwalter
had seized Ferrybridge, and posted his company
on the north side of the river. The Lancastrian
lords, however, were in no mood to be daunted; and
Clifford, who was quite as courageous as cruel, readily
undertook to dislodge the Yorkist warriors from
the position they occupied. Accordingly, at the
head of his light cavalry, and accompanied by Lord
Neville, Clifford spurred across the country, reached
Ferrybridge by break of day, and, finding the guards
asleep and utterly unsuspicious of an attack, had
little difficulty in fulfilling his mission. Ere well
awake half of the men were slaughtered, and the
survivors were glad to escape to the south side of
the Aire. Hearing a noise, and supposing that
some quarrel had arisen among his soldiers, Fitzwalter
rose from his couch, seized a battle-axe, and
hastened to restore order. But before the Yorkist
lord could even ascertain the cause of the disturbance[Pg 133]
he was surrounded and slain, and, with him,
Warwick's illegitimate brother, known as "The
Bastard of Salisbury," and described as "a valiant
young gentleman, and of great audacity."

Early on Saturday news of Clifford's exploit
reached Pontefract and caused something like a
panic in the Yorkist camp. Awed by the terrible
name of Clifford, and not unaware of the numerical
superiority of their foes, the soldiers lost heart and
showed a disposition to waver. At this crisis, however,
it became known that Warwick had mounted
his horse, and every eye was turned toward the
king-maker as he spurred through the lines straight
to King Edward.

"Sir," said the earl, dismounting, "may God
have mercy upon their souls, who, for love of you,
have lost their lives. I see no hope of succor but
in Him, to whom I remit the vengeance."

Edward, perhaps, thought Warwick was manifesting
more alarm than was either necessary or
prudent. "All who were afraid to fight might, at
their pleasure, depart," the king said, "but to those
that would stay he promised good reward; and,"
he added, "if any after staying should turn or flee,
then that he who killed such a dastard should have
double pay."

"Though your whole army should take to flight,"
said Warwick to Edward, "I will remain to fight;"[Pg 134]
and, having thus expressed his resolution to stand by
the young king to the death, the earl, in a manner
not to be mistaken, intimated to the army of the
White Rose that he, for one, rather than retreat
one inch, was prepared to die with his feet to the
foe. Drawing his sword, the patrician hero kissed
the hilt, which was in the form of a cross, and, killing
his war-horse in view of the soldiers, he exclaimed,
"Let him flee that will flee, I will tarry
with him that will tarry with me."

The effect of this sacrifice was marvelous; the
soldiers saw that their chief and idol relied solely
on their courage, that with them he would fight on
foot, and that with them he would share victory or
defeat. A feeling of enthusiasm pervaded the army,
and not one man was craven enough to desert the
great warrior-statesman in that hour of peril.

The Duke of Norfolk, as heir of Thomas de
Brotherton, held the office of earl marshal, and
was therefore entitled to lead the van of England's
army. It happened, however, that Norfolk had not
yet made his appearance among the Yorkist warriors,
and, in his absence, Warwick's uncle, Lord Falconbridge,
took the post of distinction and danger.
With a view of cutting off Clifford's cavalry from
the main body of the Lancastrians, Falconbridge, at
the head of the Yorkist van, passed the Aire at Castleford,
three miles above Ferrybridge, and, favored[Pg 135]
by the windings of the river, led his men along the
north bank ere Clifford was aware of the enemy
being in motion. On being informed of the fact,
however, the Lancastrian leader mustered his horsemen
and made a dash northward to reach the queen's
camp. Fortune, however, was this time against the
savage lord. At Dintingdale, somewhat less than
two miles from Towton, the murderer of Rutland
and the executioner of Salisbury found that the
avengers were upon him, and turned desperately
to bay. A sharp and sanguinary skirmish ensued.
Clifford offered a brave resistance to his fate, but,
pierced in the throat with an arrow, he fell, never
more to rise. Lord Neville having shared Clifford's
fate, most of the light horsemen fell where they
fought, and Ferrybridge was retaken.

On receiving intelligence of the victory at Dintingdale
and the recovery of Ferrybridge, Edward
hastened to pass the Aire, leading the centre of the
Yorkist army, while the right wing was headed by
Warwick, and the rear brought up by Sir John
Denham, a veteran warrior who had ever adhered
to the Yorkist cause, and Sir John Wenlock, who
had once already changed sides to his profit, and
was to do so again to his loss. As the day was
drawing to a close the Yorkists reached Saxton, a
village little more than a mile south from Towton,
and, on their coming in sight of the Lancastrian[Pg 136]
host, the northern and southern armies expressed
the intense hatred they felt for each other by a long
yell of defiance. At the same time Edward caused
proclamation to be made, in the hearing of both,
that, on his side, no prisoners should be taken and
no quarter given; and Somerset immediately ordered
a similar proclamation to be made in the name
of the Lancastrian chiefs.

All that cold March night the hostile armies prepared
for the combat, and on the morning of the 29th
of March       it was that of Palm Sunday       Yorkist
and Lancastrian sprang to arms. As the warriors
of the Roses approached each other snow began to
fall heavily, and, from having the wind in their faces,
the Lancastrians were much inconvenienced by the
flakes being blown in their eyes. Falconbridge,
prompt to avail himself of such a circumstance,
caused the archers in the Yorkist van to advance,
send a flight of arrows among their antagonists, and
then draw back to await the result. Galled by this
discharge, the Lancastrians, who formed the van of
the queen's army, bent their bows in retaliation;
but, blinded by snow, they shot at random, and the
shafts fell forty yards short of their adversaries.

Northumberland, the grandson of Hotspur, and
Andrew Trollope, that "terrible man-at-arms," did
not relish this inauspicious opening of the battle.
Perceiving that at a distance they were fighting at[Pg 137]
disadvantage, Trollope and the earl ordered the men
to draw their blades, to rush forward, and to close
with the foe. An unexpected obstacle, however,
presented itself to the assailants; for the northern
men, finding their feet entangled in their own shafts
that stuck in the ground, came to a halt; and the
Yorkists, galling their adversaries with another
shower of arrows, threw them into confusion, and
drove them precipitately back on the main body of
the Lancastrians.

The White Rose was so far fortunate; but the
Lancastrians, conscious of superior numbers, and
elate with their victories at Wakefield and Bernard's
Heath, were not to be daunted. Ere Northumberland
fell back on the queen's forces, the two armies
were face to face, and on neither side was there any
wish to delay meeting hand to hand. Impatient to
try conclusions, and disdaining to balk his enemies
of the close conflict they desired, Falconbridge gave
the word for his soldiers to lay aside their bows, take
to their swords, and advance to the encounter; and,
with shouts of anger and scorn, the men of the north
and of the south approached each other to decide
their quarrel with foot opposed to foot, and steel to
steel.

The clarions having sounded a charge, the battle
now began in earnest, and with such fury as had
never before been displayed by Englishmen when[Pg 138]
opposed to each other. The leaders trusted less to
their own generalship than to the courage of their
men; and the soldiers on both sides, animated with
the deadliest hatred of their foes, moved forward in
masses. Every man fought as if the quarrel had
been his own; and among the fiercest and foremost,
where skulls were cleaved and blood shed, appeared,
on one side, Andrew Trollope, performing prodigies
of valor, and, on the other, the young king, fiery with
martial ardor, and freely hazarding his life to advance
his fortunes. Mounted on barbed steed, and
arrayed in emblazoned surcoat, and his standard, on
which was a black bull, borne by Ralph Vestynden,
Edward seemed the very prince to kindle enthusiasm
in the heart of a multitude; and woe betided
those who crossed his path, as, in this, his twentieth
year, he fought with the savage valor which afterward
bore down all opposition on the fields of Barnet
and Tewkesbury. The king's courage and prowess
made him conspicuous in the fight, and his indomitable
determination contributed in no slight degree
to maintain the resolution of the Yorkists to
conquer or to die for his sake.

But, notwithstanding Edward's achievements, and
the confidence with which the soldiers fought under
Warwick's leadership, hours passed, and thousands
upon thousands fell, without the prospect of a Yorkist
victory. Still the northern war-cries rose upon[Pg 139]
the gale; still Andrew Trollope hounded the northern
men upon their foes; and still terrible proved
the sweep of those long lances with which, at Wakefield,
Herons and Tunstalls and Whartons had scattered
the chivalry of York as the wind scatters
leaves. No easy victory could, by any warriors, be
won against such foes; and in spite of all the young
king's courage, and "The Stout Earl's" sagacity, it
appeared too likely that Trollope, with fortune as
well as numbers on his side, would conquer, and
that the bloodiest day England had ever seen would
close in a Lancastrian triumph.

Meanwhile the aspect of the field was too terrible
even to be described without a shudder. All on the
ridge between Towton and Saxton were heaps of
dead, and wounded, and dying; and the blood of
the slain lay caked with the snow that covered the
ground, and afterward, dissolving with it, ran down
the furrows and ditches for miles together. Never,
indeed, in England, had such a scene of carnage been
witnessed as that upon which the villagers of Towton
and Saxton looked out from their lowly cottages,
and of which the citizens of York heard flying
rumors, as, in common with Christendom, they
celebrated the festival commemorative of our Redeemer's
entry into Jerusalem.

At length, when the battle had lasted well-nigh
ten hours, and thousands had fallen in the sanguinary[Pg 140]
conflict, fortune so far favored the Red Rose
that it seemed as if those long Border spears, so seldom
couched in vain, were destined to win back the
crown of St. Edward for Henry of Windsor. The
Yorkists were, in fact, giving way; and Warwick
must have felt that his charger had been sacrificed
in vain, and that his head was not unlikely to occupy
a place between those of York and Salisbury
over the gates of the northern capital, when, through
the snow which darkened the air and drifted over the
country, another army was seen advancing from the
south; and into the field, fresh and in no humor to
avoid the combat, came the fighting men of Norfolk,
under the banner of the princely Mowbrays, to the
aid of Edward's wavering ranks. This new arrival
of feudal warriors speedily turned the scale in favor
of York; and while Edward animated his adherents,
and Warwick urged the Yorkists to renewed exertion,
the Lancastrians, after an attempt to resist their
fate, at first slowly and frowning defiance on their
foes, but gradually with more rapid steps, commenced
a retreat northward.

Among the thousands who, on that stormy Palm
Sunday, took the field with Red Roses on their gorgets,
there was no better or braver knight than
Ralph, Lord Dacre. From his castle of Naworth,
in Cumberland, Dacre had brought his riders, arrayed
under the ancestral banner       

[Pg 141]


"That swept the shores of Judah's sea,
And waved in gales of Galilee"       


and mounted to strike for King Henry; not, perhaps,
without some presentiment of filling a warrior's
grave. But death by a mean hand the lordly
warrior would not contemplate; and with a spirit
as high as his progenitor, who fought at Acre with
Richard C      ur de Lion, he could hardly dream of
falling by a weapon less renowned than Warwick's
axe, or Edward's lance, or the sword of William
Hastings, who, in the young king's track, slaughtering
as he rode, was winning golden spurs and broad
baronies. No death so distinguished, however, awaited
Lord Dacre of the North. While in a large field,
known as the North Acre, and still in rustic tradition
and rhyme associated with his name, the haughty
Borderer, probably making a last effort to rally
the beaten and retreating Lancastrians, was mortally
wounded with an arrow shot by a boy out of
an auberry-tree, and prostrated among dead and dying
on the miry ground.

"All is lost," groaned Exeter and Somerset, in
bitter mood, as together they spurred over mounds
of slain, and galloped toward York, to warn the
queen that her foes were conquerors. And well,
indeed, might the Lancastrian dukes express themselves
in accents of despair, for never before had an
English army been in a more hapless plight than[Pg 142]
that which they were now leaving to its fate. At
first, the retreat of the Lancastrians was conducted
with some degree of order; but, ere long, their
ranks were broken by the pursuing foe, and every
thing was confusion as they fled in a mass toward
Tadcaster. No leader of mark remained to direct
or control the ill-fated army in the hour of disaster.
John Heron, and Leo, Lord Welles, were slain.
Andrew Trollope, after having "done marvelous
deeds of valor," lay cold on the ground; Northumberland
stooped his lofty crest as low as death;
Devon and Wiltshire were heading the flight, and
in vain endeavoring to place themselves beyond the
vengeance of the victors. Resistance was hopeless;
quarter was neither asked nor given; the carnage
was so frightful that the road to York was literally
red with the blood and strewn with the bodies
of the slain; and the pursuit was so hot and
eager that multitudes were drowned in attempting
to cross the rivulet of Cock, while the corpses
formed a bridge over which the pursuers passed.
The brook ran purple with blood, and crimsoned,
as it formed a junction with, the waters of the
Wharfe.

Evening closed, at length, over the field of Towton,
but without putting an end to the work of destruction.
Till the noon of Monday the pursuit was
keenly urged, and a running fight, kept up beyond[Pg 143]
the Tyne, caused much bloodshed.[7] The Chief
Justice of England and the Parson of Blokesworth
escaped. But Devon and Wiltshire were less fortunate.
One was taken near York, the other seized
near Cockermouth by an esquire named Richard
Salkeld; and both were executed by martial law.

After his signal victory on Towton Field, Edward
knighted Hastings, Humphrey Stafford, and others,
and then rode in triumph to York. Henry, with
Queen Margaret and the prince, having fled from
the city, the inhabitants received him with humble
submission; and, having taken down the heads of
his kinsmen from the gates, and set up those of
Devon and Wiltshire instead, Edward remained at
York, and kept the festival of Easter with great
splendor. After visiting Durham, and settling the
affairs of the north, the young king turned his face
toward London.

From the day on which Edward rode out of
Bishopgate until Easter, the citizens had been in
fearful suspense. At length a messenger reached
Baynard's Castle to inform the Duchess of York
that the Lancastrians had been routed; and, when
the news spread, the metropolis was the scene of[Pg 144]
joy and rejoicing. Men of all ranks breathed freely,
and thanked God for giving King Edward the
victory; and minstrels, in grateful strains, sang the
praise of the royal warrior who had saved the fair
southern shires from the fierce and rude spearmen
of the north.



[Pg 145]




CHAPTER XVII.

THE QUEEN'S STRUGGLES WITH ADVERSITY.


On Palm Sunday, when, on Towton Field, the
armies of York and Lancaster were celebrating the
festival with lances instead of palms, Margaret of
Anjou, with the king, the Prince of Wales, and
Lord De Roos, remained at York to await the issue
of the conflict. The Lancastrians, when they rode
forth, appeared so confident of victory that, in all
probability, the queen was far from entertaining
serious apprehensions. As the day wore on, however,
Somerset and Exeter spurred into the city,
announced that all was lost, and recommended a
speedy flight.

Margaret was not the woman to faint in the day
of adversity. The news brought by her discomfited
partisans was indeed hard to hear, but their advice
was too reasonable to be rejected. Dauntless in
defeat, as merciless in victory, that resolute princess
could, even at such a moment, dream of fresh
chances, and calculate the advantages to be derived
from placing herself beyond the reach of her enemies.
Besides, it was necessary to do something,
and that quickly. The day, indeed, was cold and[Pg 146]
stormy; but what were snow and sleet in comparison
with the Yorkist foe, headed by a chief who
had proved at Mortimer's Cross that he could exercise
a degree of cruelty almost as unsparing as
that of which, at Wakefield, she had been guilty?
The queen, therefore, determined on carrying her
husband and her son to Scotland; and the whole
party, mounting in haste, rode northward with all
the speed of which their horses were capable.

The way was long and the weather was cold; but
the fear of pursuit overbore all such considerations,
and the royal fugitives were fortunate enough to
reach Newcastle without being overtaken by the
light horsemen whom Edward had sent out in pursuit.
From the banks of the Tyne the queen proceeded
to Berwick, and thence found her way to
Kirkcudbright. In that ancient town of Galloway,
near which, on an island in Lockfergus, stood the
palace of the old kings of the province, Margaret
left her husband to tell his beads, while she undertook
a journey to Edinburgh, that she might concert
measures for another effort to retrieve her disasters.

At the Scottish court the unfortunate queen was
received with distinction, and warm sympathy was
expressed for her mishaps. But the Scots, though
dealing in fair words, were in no mood to assist Margaret
without a consideration; and, to tempt them,[Pg 147]
she agreed to surrender the town of Berwick, the
capital of the East Marches and the last remnant
of the great Edwards' conquests in Scotland.

Berwick having thus been placed in their possession,
the Scots commenced operations in favor of
the Red Rose. One army attacked Carlisle, another
made an incursion into the Bishopric of Durham.
Both expeditions resulted in failure. Early in June,
Warwick's brother, John Neville, Lord Montagu, defeated
the Scots under the walls of Carlisle; and,
ere the close of that month, the Lancastrians, under
Lord De Roos, were routed at Ryton and Brancepath,
in Durham.

Margaret, however, was in no humor to submit
to fortune. Finding the Scottish court unable to
render any effectual assistance, the exiled queen dispatched
Somerset to implore aid from France. An
appeal to the French monarch could hardly, she
thought, fail of producing the desired effect; for he
was her relative; he had negotiated her marriage
with Henry; and he entertained so high an opinion
of his fair kinswoman, that, at parting, he had remarked,
almost with tears in his eyes, "I feel as
though I had done nothing for my niece in placing
her on one of the greatest of European thrones, for
it is scarcely worthy of possessing her."

Misfortunes are said never to come singly; and
Margaret had, ere long, reason to believe such to be[Pg 148]
the case. Having lost her throne, she lost the only
friend who, for her own sake, would have made any
exertions to restore her. Ere Somerset reached the
court of Paris, King Charles had expired at the age
of threescore; and his son, known in history and
romance as Louis the Crafty, had succeeded to the
French crown.

Louis had no ambition to incur the enmity of
Edward of York. He even evinced his disregard
for his kinswoman's claims by causing Somerset and
other Lancastrians to be arrested while they were
traveling in the disguise of merchants. The duke
was, ere long, set free, and admitted to the king's
presence; but he could not prevail on Louis to run
any risk for the house of Lancaster; and, after lurking
for a time at Bruges, to elude Edward's spies,
he was fain to return to Scotland.

This was not the worst. The mission of Somerset
proved doubly unfortunate. Not only had he
failed in his object with the King of France, but he
had given mortal offense to the Queen of Scots.
The duke, it would seem, had, during his residence
in Scotland, been attracted by the charms of Mary
of Gueldres, and the widowed queen had showed for
him a much too favorable regard. In an hour of
indiscreet frankness Somerset revealed their familiarity
to the King of France; and, the secret becoming
known at Paris, reached the Scottish court. The[Pg 149]
royal widow, on learning that her weakness was
publicly talked of, felt the liveliest indignation;
and forthwith employed Hepburn of Hailes, a new
lover, to avenge her mortally on the chief of the
Beauforts. Moreover, she availed herself of the opportunity
to break off friendly relations with the
Lancastrian exiles.

Matters had now, in fact, reached such a stage
that Mary of Gueldres could hardly have avoided a
quarrel with the Lancastrians. The young King of
England was far from indifferent to the advantage
of a close alliance with the Scots; and Warwick
commenced negotiations by proposing, on behalf of
Edward, a marriage with their queen. Crossing
the Border in the spring of 1462, the king-maker arrived
at Dumfries to arrange a matrimonial treaty.

Margaret of Anjou must now have been somewhat
perplexed. Even if she had not received
warning to quit the country, the presence of "The
Stout Earl" at Dumfries was a hint not to be mistaken.
Feeling that it was time to be gone, the
Lancastrian queen obtained a convoy of four Scottish
ships, and, embarking with her son, sailed for
the Continent. Landing on the coast of Brittany,
Margaret visited the duke of that province; and he,
compassionating her misfortunes, advanced her a
sum of money. After passing some time with King
René, who was then at Anjou, she proceeded with[Pg 150]
the Prince of Wales to the French court, and implored
Louis to aid in restoring Henry of Windsor
to his father's throne.

The French monarch had as little inclination as
before to rush into war with a powerful nation
merely to redress the wrongs of a distressed princess.
But Louis had a keen eye to his own interests, and
no objection to meet Margaret's wishes, if, while doing
so, he could advance his projects. He, therefore,
went cunningly to work, declaring at first that his
own poverty was such as to preclude the possibility
of interference in the affairs of others, but gradually
making Margaret comprehend that he would furnish
her with money if Calais were assigned to him as
security.

After the battle of Cressy, Calais had been taken
from the French by the third Edward, and was a
conquest for a king to boast of. Such, at least,
continued the opinion of the commons of England.
Indeed, when sighing over the memory of Cressy,
Poictiers, and Agincourt, and reflecting on their
subsequent disasters, patriots never failed to console
themselves with the thought that, so long as
Calais remained in their possession, they carried
the keys of France and of Flanders at their girdle.
Margaret did not, of course, sympathize with such
sentiments; and, catching at the proposal of Louis,
she put Calais in pawn for twenty thousand livres.[Pg 151]
Having received this sum, she raised an army of two
thousand men.

At that time there was languishing in prison a
French captain of great renown, named Peter de
Brezé, who, in the reign of King Charles, had occupied
a high position, and greatly distinguished
himself at a tournament held in honor of Margaret's
bridal. Inspired on that occasion by the
Provençal princess with a chivalrous devotion which
was proof against time and change, he offered, if set
free, to conduct her little army to England; and
Louis, hoping, it is said, that the brave captain
might perish in the enterprise, gave him his liberty.

Brezé, embarking with the queen, set sail for
Northumberland. Fortune did not, in any respect,
favor the invaders. They, indeed, escaped the vigilance
of Edward's fleet, and attempted to land at
Tynemouth; but, the weather proving unfavorable,
they were driven ashore near Bamburgh. The queen
had anticipated that the whole north would hail her
coming, but she was utterly disappointed; for, instead
of friends rushing to her aid, there appeared
Sir Robert Manners of Etal, and the Bastard Ogle,
who, zealous for the White Rose, attacked her little
force with so much determination that the Frenchmen
were utterly routed.

Margaret was fain to turn toward Berwick; but,
undismayed by reverses, she determined to persevere.[Pg 152]
Leaving her son in safety, and having been
joined by some English exiles and a body of Scots,
she seized the Castles of Bamburgh, Dunstanburgh,
and Alnwick. While in Alnwick, the strong-hold
of the Percies, she was dismayed by intelligence of
Warwick's approach; and, after taking counsel with
Brezé, retired to her ships. As she put to sea, however,
a storm arose, scattered her little fleet, and
wrecked the vessels bearing her money and stores
on the rocky coast of Northumberland. The queen
was in the utmost danger; but, having been placed
on board a fishing-boat, she had the fortune, in spite
of wind and weather, to reach Berwick.

Warwick, meanwhile, approached with twenty
thousand men; and Edward, following, took up his
quarters at Durham. The queen's French troops
fared badly. Five hundred of them, endeavoring
to maintain themselves on Holy Island, were cut to
pieces; and the garrisons of the three northern castles
were soon in a desperate condition. Indeed,
the plight of the Lancastrians appeared so utterly
hopeless, that Somerset submitted to Edward, and,
having been received into the king's favor, fought
against his old friends.

Becoming most anxious to save Brezé, who, within
the Castle of Alnwick, was reduced to extremity,
Margaret applied to George Douglas, Earl of Angus,
to rescue the gallant Frenchman from the jeopardy[Pg 153]
in which he was placed. "Madam," replied Angus,
who was father of the famous Bell-the-Cat, "I will
do my utmost;" and, having crossed the Border with
a chosen band of spearmen, he broke through the
ranks of the besiegers and carried off the garrison
in safety.

The prospects of the Lancastrians were now dismal.
Margaret, however, did not despair. Her
courage was still too high       her spirit too haughty       to
give up the game, which she had hitherto
played with so little success. Being on the Scottish
marches, she cultivated the friendship of those chiefs
whose spearmen were the plague of lordly wardens
and the terror of humble villagers.

In the halls of Border lords, who, with hands
strong to smite, had, under their coats of mail,
hearts far from insensible to the tears of a beautiful
woman and the supplications of a distressed
princess, Margaret told the story of her wrongs.
With a voice now stirring as the sound of a trumpet,
now melancholy as the wind sighing among
sepulchral yews, she reminded them what she had
been, when, eighteen years earlier, England's nobles
paid homage to her at Westminster, as she sat on
the throne, wearing the crown of gold and the mantle
of purple; how, when a fugitive, pursued by enemies
thirsting for her blood, she had endured want
and hunger; and how, when an exile, depending for[Pg 154]
bread on the charity of rivals, she had been humbled
to beg from a Scottish archer the mite which she
placed on the shrine of a saint. Her poetic eloquence,
potent to move the heart, drew tears from
ladies, and caused men to lay their hands upon their
swords, and swear, by God and St. George, that such
things must no longer be. Ever, when Margaret was
in distress, and laid aside her imperious tone and
haughty manner, she became too persuasive and
insinuating to be resisted. It was impossible for
listeners to resist the conclusion that of all injured
ladies she had suffered most, and that they would
be unworthy longer to wear the crest and plume of
knights who did not use every effort to restore her
to that throne which they believed her so well qualified
to grace.

Thus it came to pass that when the winter of
1463 had passed, and the spring of 1464 again
painted the earth, the Red Rose-tree began to blossom
anew. Margaret found herself at the head of
a formidable army; and Somerset, hearing of her
success, deserted Edward's court, rode post-haste to
the north, and took part in the Lancastrian insurrection.
All over England there was a spirit of
discontent with the new government; and Edward,
while watching the movements of the malcontents,
got so enthralled by female charms that, instead of
taking the field against the Lancastrian warriors, he[Pg 155]
was exerting all his skill to achieve a triumph over
a Lancastrian widow. However, he called upon his
subjects to arm in his defense, and ordered a numerous
force to march to the aid of Lord Montagu, who
commanded in the north.

Margaret was all fire and energy. Carrying in
her train her meek husband and hopeful son, she, in
April, once more raised the Lancastrian banner, and
marched southward. Somerset and his brother, Edmund
Beaufort, were already at her side; and thither,
also, went Exeter, De Roos, Hungerford, with Sir
Ralph Percy, who had for a while submitted to Edward,
and Sir Ralph Grey, who, having been a violent
Yorkist, had lately, in revenge for not being
granted the Castle of Alnwick, become enthusiastic
for Lancaster.

Montagu, as Warden of the Marches, now found
his position too close to the enemy to be either safe
or pleasant. Undismayed, however, that feudal captain
met the crisis with a courage worthy of his noble
name, and a vigilance worthy of his high office.
At Hedgley Moor, near Wooler, on the 25th of April,
he fell on a party of the Lancastrians, under Sir
Ralph Percy, and defeated them with slaughter.
Sir Ralph, a son of the great northern earl slain at
St. Albans, and a high-spirited warrior, fell fighting,
exclaiming, with his latest breath, "I have saved the
bird in my bosom."

[Pg 156]

After having so auspiciously commenced his Northumbrian
campaign, Montagu paused; but when Edward
did not appear, the noble warden lost patience,
and determined to strike a decisive blow. Hearing
that the Lancastrians were encamped on Level's
Plain, on the south side of the Dowel Water, near
Hexham, he, on the 8th of May, bore down upon
their camp. Somerset, who commanded the Lancastrians,
was taken by surprise, and, indeed, had at
no time the martial skill to contend with such a
captain as Montagu. The northern men, however,
met the unexpected attack with their usual intrepidity;
but their courage proved of no avail. For
a time, it appears that neither side could boast of
any advantage; till Montagu, growing impatient,
urged his men to "do it valiantly;" and, after a
desperate effort, the Yorkists entered the queen's
camp. A bloody conflict ensued; the Lancastrians
were put to the rout; poor Henry fled in terror and
amaze, and, mounted on a swift steed, contrived to
get out of the fray, leaving part of his equipage in
the hands of the victors.

A few days after Hexham, Edward arrived at
York, and, having been there met by Montagu, was
presented with the high cap of state called "Abacot,"
which Henry of Windsor had left behind on
the day of battle. Out of gratitude, the king granted
to his victorious warden the earldom of Northumberland,[Pg 157]
which, having been forfeited by the Percies,
whose heir was then either a captive in the
Tower or an exile in Scotland, could hardly have
been more appropriately bestowed than on a lineal
descendant of Cospatrick and Earl Uchtred.

Edward, however, had to punish as well as reward,
and such of the Lancastrians as fell into the
hands of the victors were treated with extreme severity.
Somerset, who knew not where to turn,
who had no reason to expect mercy in England, and
no reason to expect protection in Scotland       since
his revelations as to Mary of Gueldres had led Warwick
to break off matrimonial negotiations on behalf
of Edward       was discovered lurking in a wood, carried
to Hexham, tried by martial law, and beheaded.
The ill-starred duke died unmarried, but not without
issue; and his descendants, in the illegitimate
line, were destined to occupy a high place among the
modern aristocracy of England. It happened that
a fair being, named Joan Hill, without being a wife,
became a mother. Of her son, Somerset was understood
to be the father. After the duke's execution,
the boy went by the name of Charles Somerset; and,
as years passed over, he won the favor of the Tudors.
By Henry the Eighth he was created Earl of Worcester;
and by Charles the Second the Earls of
Worcester were elevated in the peerage to the dukedom
of Beaufort.

[Pg 158]

About the time when Somerset perished on the
scaffold, the Red Rose lost a chief, scarcely less conspicuous,
by the death of Lord de Roos. His widow
found a home with her eldest daughter, the wife of
Sir Robert Manners, of Etal; his son Edmund escaped
to the Continent; and his Castle of Belvoir,
inherited through an ancestress from William de Albini,
was granted by King Edward to William Hastings,
who, since Towton, had become a baron of the
realm, and husband of Warwick's sister, Katherine
Neville, the widow of Lord Bonville, slain at Wakefield.
Hastings hurried to Leicestershire, to take
possession of Belvoir; but the county, faithful to the
banished De Roos, turned out under an esquire
named Harrington and compelled the Yorkist lord
to fly. Perceiving that to hold the castle under such
circumstances would be no easy task, Hastings returned
with a large force, spoiled the building, and
carried off the leads to the stately pile he was rearing
at Ashby de la Zouch.

The Lord Hungerford, with Sir Humphrey Neville,
and William Tailbois, whom the Lancastrians
called Earl of Kent, died, like Somerset, on the scaffold.
But a punishment much more severe was added
in the case of Sir Ralph Grey. This unfortunate
renegade, when found in the Castle of Bamburgh,
was condemned, ere being executed, to degradation
from the rank of knighthood. Every thing[Pg 159]
was prepared for the ceremony; and the master
cook, with his apron and knife, stood ready to strike
off the gilded spurs close by the heels. But from
respect to the memory of the knight's grandfather,
who had suffered much for the king's ancestors, this
part of the punishment was remitted.

The hopes of the Lancastrians could hardly have
survived so signal a disaster as their defeat at Hexham,
if one circumstance had not rendered the victory
of Montagu incomplete. Margaret of Anjou
had, as if by miracle, escaped; and, while she was
in possession of life and liberty, friends and adversaries
were alike conscious that no battle, however
bravely fought or decisively won, could secure the
crown or assure the succession to the house of York.



[Pg 160]




CHAPTER XVIII.

THE WOODVILLES.


About the opening of 1464, Edward, King of
England, then in his twenty-fourth year, was diverting
himself with the pleasures of the chase in the
forest of Whittlebury.

One day, when hunting in the neighborhood of
Grafton, the king rode to that manor-house and
alighted to pay his respects to Jacqueline, Duchess
of Bedford. The visit was, perhaps, not altogether
prompted by courtesy. He was then watching, with
great suspicion, the movements of the Lancastrians,
and he probably hoped to elicit from the duchess,
who was a friend of Margaret of Anjou, some intelligence
as to the intentions of the faction to which
she belonged       forgetting, by-the-by, that the duchess
was a woman of great experience, and had long
since, under trying circumstances, learned how to
make words conceal her thoughts.

Jacqueline of Luxembourg, a daughter of the
Count of St. Pol, when young, lively, and beautiful,
found herself given in marriage to John, Duke of
Bedford. John was a famous man, doubtless, but
very considerably the senior of his bride; and when[Pg 161]
he died at Rouen, Jacqueline probably considered
that, in any second matrimonial alliance, she ought
to take the liberty of consulting her own taste. In
any case, one of the duke's esquires, Richard Woodville
by name, was appointed to escort her to England;
and he, being among the handsomest men in
Europe, made such an impression on the heart of
the youthful widow, that a marriage was the result.
For seven long years their union was kept secret;
but at length circumstances rendered concealment
impossible, and the marriage became a matter of
public notoriety.

The discovery that the widow of the foremost
prince and soldier of Europe had given her hand to
a man who could not boast of a patrician ancestor
or a patriotic achievement caused much astonishment,
and such was the indignation of Jacqueline's
own kinsmen that Woodville never again ventured
to show his face on the Continent. To the esquire
and the duchess, however, the consequences, though
inconvenient, were not ruinous. A fine of a thousand
pounds was demanded from Woodville; and,
having paid that sum, he was put in possession of
Jacqueline's castles.

As time passed on, the Duchess of Bedford, as "a
foreign lady of quality," insinuated herself into the
good graces of Margaret of Anjou; and Woodville
was, through the interest of his wife, created a baron.[Pg 162]
About the same period their eldest daughter, Elizabeth,
became a maid of honor to the queen, and,
subsequently, wife of John Grey of Groby, a zealous
Lancastrian, who died after the second battle of St.
Albans. Finding herself a widow, and the times
being troublous, Elizabeth placed herself under the
protection of her mother at Grafton. There she
was residing when the Yorkist king appeared to pay
his respects to the duchess.

Elizabeth probably regarded Edward's visit as
providential. She had two sons; and, as the partisans
of York were by no means in a humor to practice
excessive leniency to the vanquished, the heirs
of Grey were in danger of losing lands and living
for their father's adherence to the Red Rose. Believing
that she had now a capital opportunity of
obtaining the removal of the attainder, she resolved
to throw herself at the king's feet and implore his
clemency.

An oak-tree between Grafton and Whittlebury
Forest has since been indicated by tradition as the
scene of Elizabeth Woodville's first interview with
Edward of York. Standing under the branches,
holding her sons by the hand, and casting down her
eyes with an affectation of extreme modesty, the
artful widow succeeded in arresting his attention.
Indeed, there was little chance of Edward of York
passing such a being without notice. Elizabeth was[Pg 163]
on the shady side of thirty, to be sure; but time had
not destroyed the charms that, fifteen years earlier,
had brought suitors around the portionless maid of
honor. Her features were remarkable for regularity;
her complexion was fair and delicate, and her
hair of that pale golden hue then deemed indispensable
in a beauty of rank.

Edward's eye was arrested, and, being in the fever
of youth, with a heart peculiarly susceptible, he was
captivated by the fair suppliant. Too young and
confident to believe in the possibility of his addresses
being rejected, the king made love, though not in
such terms as please the ear of a virtuous woman.
Elizabeth, however, conducted herself with rare discretion,
and made her royal lover understand that
monarchs sometimes sigh in vain. At length the
duchess took the matter in hand; and, under the
influence of a tactician so expert, the enamored
king set prudential considerations at defiance, and
offered to take the young widow for better or for
worse. A secret marriage was then projected; Jacqueline
applied her energies to the business; and,
with her experience of matrimonial affairs, the
duchess found no difficulty in arranging every thing
to satisfaction.

The ceremony was fixed for the 1st of May, and,
since privacy was the object, the day was well chosen.
Indeed, May-day was the festival which people regarded[Pg 164]
as next in importance to Christmas; and
they were too much taken up with its celebration to
pry into the secrets of others. It was while milkmaids,
with pyramids of silver plate on their heads,
were dancing from door to door, and every body was
preparing to dance round the maypole, that Edward
secretly met his bride at the chapel of Grafton, and
solemnized that marriage which was destined to
bring such evils on the country. As the duchess
probably suspected that it was not the first time the
king had figured as a bridegroom, she was careful,
in the event of any dispute arising, to provide herself
with other witnesses than the priest and the
mass-boy. With this view she brought two of her
waiting-women; and the king, having gone through
the ceremony, took his departure as secretly as he
came. Ere long, however, Edward intimated to the
father of the bride that he intended to spend some
time with him at Grafton; and Woodville, who still
feigned ignorance of the marriage, took care that his
royal son-in-law should have nothing to complain of
in regard to the entertainment.

Having thus wedded her daughter to the chief of
the White Rose, the Duchess of Bedford converted
her husband and sons from violent Lancastrians into
unscrupulous Yorkists, and then manifested a strong
desire to have the marriage acknowledged. This
was a most delicate piece of business, and, managed[Pg 165]
clumsily, might have cost the king his crown. It
happened, however, that while Edward, in the shades
of Grafton, had forgotten every thing that he ought
to have remembered, Montagu, by his victory at
Hexham, had so firmly established Edward's power
that the king deemed himself in a position to inflict
signal chastisement on any one venturesome enough
to dispute his sovereign will. Nevertheless, it was
thought prudent to ascertain the feeling of the nation
before taking any positive step; and agents
were employed for that purpose.

Warwick and Montagu were not, of course, the
men for this kind of work. The chief person engaged
in the inquiry, indeed, appears to have been
Sir John Howard, a knight of Norfolk, whose family
had, in the fourteenth century, been raised from obscurity
by a successful lawyer, and, in the fifteenth,
elevated somewhat higher by a marriage with the
Mowbrays, about the time when the chief of that
great house was under attainder and in exile.
Howard, inspired, perhaps, by his Mowbray blood,
cherished an ardent ambition to enroll his name
among the old nobility of England; and, to get one
inch nearer the gratification of his vanity, he appears
to have undertaken any task, however undignified.
Even on this occasion he was not by any means too
nice for the duty to be performed; and he was careful
to return an answer likely to please those who[Pg 166]
were most interested. Finding that the Woodvilles
were rising in the world, he reported, to their satisfaction,
that the people were well disposed in regard
to the king's marriage. At the same time the aspiring
knight was not forgetful of his own interests.
He entreated the Woodvilles to obtain, for himself
and his spouse, places in the new queen's household;
and, by way of securing Elizabeth's favor, presented
her with a palfrey, as a mark of his devotion to her
service. What dependence was to be placed on the
faith or honor of Sir John Howard, Elizabeth Woodville
found twenty years later, when her hour of
trial and tribulation came.

And now Edward, whose fortunes half the royal
damsels of Europe, among others Isabella of Castile,
afterward the great Queen of Spain, were eager to
share, resolved upon declaring his marriage to the
world; and, with that purpose, he summoned a great
council, to meet at the Abbey of Reading, in the autumn
of 1464. Having there presented Elizabeth
to the assembled peers as their queen, he ordered
preparations to be made for her coronation in the
ensuing spring.

In the mean time, the king's marriage caused serious
discontent. Warwick and Edward's brother,
the young Duke of Clarence, in particular, expressed
their displeasure; the barons murmured that no King
of England, since the Conquest, had dared to marry[Pg 167]
his own subject; and ladies of high rank, like the
Nevilles and De Veres, were, in no slight degree,
indignant at having set over them one whom they
had been accustomed to consider an inferior. At
the same time, the multitude, far from regarding the
marriage with the favor which Sir John Howard
had led the Woodvilles to believe, raised the cry
that the Duchess of Bedford was a witch, and that
it was under the influence of the "forbidden spells"
she practiced that the young king had taken the fatal
step of espousing her daughter.

But nobody was more annoyed at Edward's marriage
than his own mother, Cicely, Duchess of York,
who, in other days, had been known in the north as
"The Rose of Raby," and who now maintained
great state at Baynard's Castle. From the beginning,
Elizabeth found no favor in the eyes of her
mother-in-law. With the beauty of the Nevilles,
Cicely inherited a full share of their pride; and, in
her husband's lifetime, she had assumed something
like regal state. To such a woman an alliance with
third-rate Lancastrians was mortifying, and she bitterly
reproached her son with the folly of the step
he had taken. Moreover, she upbraided him with
faithlessness to another lady; but Edward treated
the matter with characteristic recklessness. "Madam,"
said he, "for your objection of bigamy, by
God's Blessed Lady, let the bishop lay it to my[Pg 168]
charge when I come to take orders; for I understand
it is forbidden to a priest, though I never wist
it was forbidden to a prince."

Not insensible, however, to the sneers of which
Elizabeth was the object, Edward determined on
proving to his subjects that his bride was, after all,
of royal blood, and therefore no unfit occupant of a
throne. With this purpose he entreated Charles
the Rash, Count of Charolois, and heir of Burgundy,
to send her uncle, James of Luxembourg, to the
coronation. The count, it appears, had never acknowledged
the existence of the Duchess of Bedford
since her second marriage; but, on hearing of the
position Jacqueline's daughter had attained, his sentiments
as to the Woodville alliance underwent a
complete change, and he promised to take part in
the coronation.

Faithful to his promise, the count appeared in
England with a magnificent retinue; and his niece
was brought from the palace of Eltham, conducted
in great state through the city of London, and crowned,
with much pomp, at Westminster. Hardly, however,
had Elizabeth Woodville been invested with
the symbols of royalty, than she found the crown sit
uneasily on her head. The efforts made to render
King Edward's marriage popular had failed. Even
the presence of a Count of Luxembourg had not produced
the effect anticipated. Still the old barons[Pg 169]
of England grumbled fiercely; and still the people
continued to denounce the Duchess of Bedford as a
sorceress who had bewitched the king into marrying
her daughter. Ere long, this widow of a Lancastrian
knight, when sharing the throne of the Yorkist
king, found that, with the White Rose, she had
plucked the thorn.

The new queen conducted herself in such a way
as rapidly to increase the prejudices of the nation.
After her marriage she too frequently reminded people
of the school in which she had studied the functions
of royalty. Indeed, Elizabeth Woodville, when
elevated to a throne, assumed a tone which great
queens like Eleanor of Castile and Philippa of Hainault
would never have dreamed of using. Charitably
inclined as the patrician ladies of England
might be, they could hardly help remarking that
Margaret of Anjou's maid of honor did credit to the
training of her mistress.

The people of England might have learned to
bear much from Edward's wife; but, unfortunately,
the queen was intimately associated in the public
mind with the rapacity of her "kindred." Elizabeth's
father, Richard Woodville, was created Earl
Rivers, and appointed Treasurer of England; and
she had numerous brothers and sisters, for all of
whom fortunes had to be provided. Each of the
sisters was married to a noble husband       Katherine,[Pg 170]
the youngest, to Henry Stafford, the boy-Duke of
Buckingham; and for each of the brothers an heiress
to high titles and great estates had to be found.
Unfortunately, while the Woodvilles were pursuing
their schemes of family aggrandizement, their interests
clashed with those of two powerful and popular
personages. These were the Duchess of York and
the Earl of Warwick.

Among the old nobility of England, whose names
are chronicled by Dugdale, the Lord Scales occupied
an eminent position. At an early period they granted
lands to religious houses and made pilgrimages
to the Holy Land, and in later days fought with the
Plantagenet kings in the wars of Scotland and
France. The last chief of the name, who, after
Northampton, suffered for his fidelity to the house
of Lancaster, left no sons. One daughter, however,
survived him; and this lady, having been married to
a younger son of the Earl of Essex, was now a widow,
twenty-four years of age, and one of the richest
heiresses in England.

Upon the heiress of Scales, Elizabeth Woodville
and the Duchess of York both set their hearts. The
Duchess wished to marry the wealthy widow to her
son George, Duke of Clarence; and the queen was
not less anxious to bestow the young lady's hand on
her brother, Anthony Woodville, who was one of
the most accomplished gentlemen of the age. The[Pg 171]
contest between the mother-in-law and the daughter-in-law
was, doubtless, keen. The queen, however,
carried her point; and the duchess retreating,
baffled and indignant, wrapped herself up in cold
hauteur.

Of all the English heiresses of that day, the greatest,
perhaps, was the daughter of the Duke and
Duchess of Exeter. The duke, having fought at
Towton and Hexham for the Red Rose, was now
braving poverty and exile for the house of Lancaster;
but the duchess had not deemed it necessary
to make any such sacrifice. Being a daughter of
the Duke of York, she remained quietly at the court
of King Edward, her brother, and, while enjoying
the estates of her banished husband, acquired the
right to dispose of his daughter's hand.

The heiress of the Hollands was, of course, a prize
much coveted; and Warwick thought her hand so
desirable, that he solicited her in marriage for his
nephew, young George Neville, the son of Lord
Montagu. The queen, however, was determined to
obtain this heiress for her eldest son, Thomas Grey,
who had been created Marquis of Dorset. The
Duchess of Exeter was, accordingly, dealt with, and
in such a fashion that the earl was disappointed,
while the queen congratulated her son on having
obtained a bride worthy of the rank to which he
had been elevated.

[Pg 172]

Warwick was nephew of the Duchess of York,
and both had already a grievance of which to complain.
They were now to have their family pride
wounded in a manner which, to souls so haughty,
must have been well-nigh intolerable.

Long ere the Wars of the Roses were thought of,
Katherine Neville, elder sister of the proud duchess,
and aunt of "The Stout Earl," was espoused by
John Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk. The duke departed
this life in 1433, and Katherine gave her
hand to an esquire named Strangways. When time
passed on, and Strangways died, she consoled herself
with a third husband in the person of Viscount
Beaumont. The viscount went the way the duke
and the esquire had gone, and Katherine found herself
a third time a widow. But the dowager had
buried her share of husbands; she had passed the
age of eighty; and as to a fourth dash at matrimony,
that was surely a subject which could never
have entered into her head.

The Woodvilles were aware of the existence of
the old Duchess of Norfolk, and knew that the venerable
dame was rich; and the queen's youngest
brother remained to be provided for. Setting decency
at defiance, they resolved upon a match; and
though the wealthy dowager had considerably passed
the age of fourscore, and John Woodville had just
emerged from his teens, a marriage was solemnized.[Pg 173]
The nation was deeply disgusted with the avarice
manifested on this occasion. Even Sir John Howard
must now have confessed that the king's alliance
with the Woodvilles was not quite so satisfactory
to the people as he had predicted. The clamor
raised was too loud and general to be either disregarded
or suppressed. The Nevilles must have
writhed under the ridicule to which their aged
kinswoman was exposed; other adherents of the
White Rose must have blushed for the disgrace reflected
on Edward of York from his wife's family;
and the Lancastrian exiles, wearing threadbare garments
and bearing fictitious names, as they climbed
narrow stairs and consumed meagre fare in the rich
cities of Flanders, must have felt hope and taken
heart, when to their ears came tidings of the shout
of indignation which all England was raising against
the new "queen's kindred."



[Pg 174]




CHAPTER XIX.

THE LANCASTRIANS IN EXILE.


On that day when Lord Montagu inflicted so severe
a defeat on the Lancastrians at Hexham, and
while the shouts of victory rose and swelled with
the breeze, a lady of thirty-five, but still possessing
great personal attractions, accompanied by a boy
just entering his teens, fled for safety into a forest
which then extended over the district, and was
known far and wide as a den of outlaws. The
lady was Margaret of Anjou; the boy was Edward
of Lancaster; and, unfortunately for them, under
the circumstances, the dress and appearance of the
royal fugitives marked them too plainly as personages
of the highest rank.

While treading the forest path with a tremulous
haste, which indicated some apprehension of pursuit,
Margaret and her son suddenly found themselves
face to face with a band of ferocious robbers. The
bandits were far from paying any respect to the
queen's rank or sex. Having seized her jewels and
other valuables, they dragged her forcibly before the
chief of the gang, held a drawn sword before her
eyes, and menaced her with instant death. Margaret[Pg 175]
besought them to spare her life, but her prayers
and tears had no effect whatever in melting their
hearts; and they appeared on the point of carrying
their threats into execution, when, luckily, they fell
to wrangling over the partition of the spoil, and,
ere long, took to settling the dispute by strength of
hand.

Alarmed, as Margaret well might be, she did not
lose her presence of mind. No sooner did she observe
the bandits fighting among themselves than
she looked around for a way of escape; and, seizing
a favorable opportunity, she hurried her son into a
thicket which concealed them from view. Pursuing
their way till the shades of evening closed over
the forest, the royal fugitives, faint from fatigue and
want of food, seated themselves under an oak-tree,
and bewailed their fate.

No wonder that, at such moments of desolation
and distress, the Lancastrian queen felt a temptation
to rid herself of a life which misfortune made so miserable.
Even the heroic spirit of Margaret might
have given way under circumstances so depressing
as those in which she was now placed. But a new
and unexpected danger occurred to recall her to energy
while indulging in those pensive reflections;
for, as the moon began to shine through the branches
of the trees, she suddenly became aware of the approach
of an armed man of huge stature. At first[Pg 176]
she was under the impression that he was one of the
robbers from whom she had already experienced
treatment so cruel, and gave herself up for lost;
but seeing, by the light of the moon, that his dress
and appearance were quite different, she breathed a
prayer, and resolved upon a great effort to save herself
and her son.

Margaret knew that escape was impossible. She,
therefore, made no attempt at flight; but, rising, she
took her son by the hand, advanced to meet the man,
explained in pathetic language the distress in which
she was, and, as a woman and a princess, claimed
his protection. "It is the unfortunate Queen of
England," said Margaret, "who has fallen into your
hands;" and then, suiting the action to the word,
she added in accents not to be resisted, "There,
my friend, I commit to your care the safety of your
king's son."

[Pg 177]

[Pg 178]THE QUEEN IN THE OUTLAW'S CAVE.


The queen had taken a bold course, but she had
correctly calculated the effect of her appeal. Her
courage and presence of mind had saved her. The
generosity of the outlaw prevailed; and, touched
with the confidence reposed in him, he threw himself
at Margaret's feet, and vowed to do all in his
power to save the mother and the son. Having
once promised, the man of the forest kept his word
with a loyalty that his betters might have envied.
He conducted the fugitives to his dwelling in a
[Pg 179]
rock, which is still shown as "The Queen's Cave,"
instructed his wife to do every thing that would tend
to their comfort, and promised to discover for them
the means of escape.

Leaving Margaret and her son in his cave, the
mouth of which was protected by the bank of a rivulet,
and screened from view by brushwood, the outlaw
went to inquire after such of her friends as had
escaped the carnage of Hexham. More fortunate
than could have been expected, he met Sir Peter
Brezé, who was wandering about looking for the
queen, and, soon after, Brezé found the Duke of
Exeter, who had concealed himself in a neighboring
village, and, with the duke, Edmund Beaufort, who
had now, by the death of his brother on the scaffold,
become head of the house of Somerset. With these
noblemen, Margaret and the prince went secretly to
Carlisle, and there, with the assistance of the generous
outlaw, embarked for Kirkcudbright.

Margaret, on reaching Scotland, visited Edinburgh
to make another appeal to the government, but was
not successful in obtaining farther aid. In fact, although
the matrimonial negotiations between Mary
of Gueldres and Edward of York had come to
naught, the Scottish government was now utterly
hostile to the interests of Lancaster. The Duke
of Burgundy, hereditary foe of Margaret, had sent
Louis de Bruges, one of his noblemen, as embassador[Pg 180]
to the Scottish court, and contrived to make the
regency play false, repudiate the marriage between
the Prince of Wales and the Princess of Scotland,
and conclude a treaty with the new King of England.

The Lancastrians now perceived that for the present
action was impossible, and exile inevitable. Even
in France their influence had diminished; for, since
Margaret's visit to Paris, Mary of Anjou, her aunt
and the mother of Louis, had died; and less inclination
than ever felt the crafty king to make sacrifices
for his fiery kinswoman. Margaret, therefore, yielded
to fate, and, not without vowing vengeance on
Burgundy, submitted to the harsh necessity of once
more returning to the Continent. With this view,
she repaired to Bamburgh, which was still held by
Lancastrians, and with her son, and Sir Peter Brezé,
and seven ladies, she embarked for France.

It was summer, but notwithstanding the season
the weather proved unpropitious, and the unfortunate
queen, driven by adverse winds, was under the
necessity of putting into a port belonging to the
Duke of Burgundy. Enemy of her father as the
duke was, Margaret determined upon seeing him,
and, suppressing all feelings of delicacy, she dispatched
a messenger to demand an interview.

The house of Burgundy, like that of Anjou, derived
descent from the kings of France, but had been[Pg 181]
blessed with far fairer fortunes. About 1360, on
the death of Philip de Rouvre, the dukedom, having
reverted to the crown, was bestowed by King John
on his fourth son, Philip the Bold. Philip played
his cards well. While his brother Charles was
struggling with the English, he became an independent
prince by espousing the heiress of Flanders; and
his son, John the Fearless, played a conspicuous
part in those civil commotions that preceded the
battle of Agincourt. The son of John, known as
Philip the Good, affected greater state than any
prince of his age, and instituted the order of the
Golden Fleece to mark the splendor of his reign.

Philip's first wife was Michelle, daughter of the
King of France, and sister of Katherine de Valois.
His second wife was Isabel of Portugal, a granddaughter
of John of Gaunt. The good duke was,
therefore, nearly and doubly connected with the
house of Lancaster. Unfortunately, however, Philip
had proved an enemy of King René; and Margaret,
who from infancy had cherished a bitter hatred toward
the house of Burgundy, was reputed to have
vowed that if ever the duke was at her mercy the
executioner's axe should pass between his head and
his shoulders. Such having been the language held
by the queen, it is not wonderful that the duke,
while receiving her message with politeness, should
have pleaded sickness as an excuse for not granting
her a personal interview.

[Pg 182]

Margaret was in no mood to be satisfied with excuses.
She had expressed her intention of seeing
the duke, and was determined to accomplish her
purpose. She was hardly in a condition, indeed, to
pay a royal visit, for her purse was empty, and her
wardrobe reduced to the smallest compass. But,
scorning to be subdued by fortune, the queen hired
a cart covered with canvas, and, leaving her son at
Bruges, commenced her progress to St. Pol, where
the duke was then residing. It was about the time
when Margaret, dressed in threadbare garments, was
traveling from Bruges to St. Pol in a covered cart,
that, in the Abbey of Reading, her maid of honor,
Elizabeth Woodville, was presented to peers and
prelates as Queen of England.

While pursuing her journey, with a spirit of heroism
which set outward circumstances at defiance,
Margaret was met by Charles the Rash, that impersonation
of feudal pride, whose exploits against the
Swiss, when Duke of Burgundy, have been celebrated
by Sir Walter Scott. Charles, at this time,
had hardly passed the age of thirty, and, as son and
heir of Philip the Good, with whom he was then at
enmity, bore the title of Count of Charolois. As
the son of Isabel of Portugal, and great-grandson of
John of Gaunt, the count had always declared himself
friendly to the house of Lancaster, and he now
manifested his sympathy by treating Margaret with[Pg 183]
chivalrous respect. Moreover, on being made aware
of her extreme poverty, Charolois presented her with
five hundred crowns; and Burgundy, hearing of the
landing of English forces at Calais, sent a body of
his archers to escort her from Bethune to St. Pol.
Having, after her interview with Charolois, pursued
her way toward Bethune, and escaped some English
horsemen who lay in wait to arrest her, she reached
St. Pol in safety.

Duke Philip did not immediately grant Margaret
an interview. After some delay, however, he indulged
her wish; and, touched with compassion at
the sight of a great queen reduced to a plight so
hapless, entertained her with princely courtesy, and
treated her with all the honors due to royalty.
Having listened to the story of Margaret's woes, he
gave her two thousand crowns of gold, and advised
her to await events with patience. As Margaret
parted from the duke her heart melted, and she shed
tears as she bade adieu to the old man whom she
had threatened to behead as she had done York and
Salisbury. Perhaps on that occasion she, for one
of the first times in her life, felt something like remorse.
"The queen," says Monstrelet, "repented
much and thought herself unfortunate that she had
not sooner thrown herself on the protection of the
noble Duke of Burgundy, as her affairs would probably
have prospered better."

[Pg 184]

Having returned to Bruges, and been joined by
the Prince of Wales, Margaret paid a visit to the
Count of Charolois. Never were royal exiles more
royally treated. The count exhibited a degree of
delicacy and generosity worthy of an earlier era;
and, indeed, was so deferential, that the Prince of
Wales, who had known little of royalty but its perils
and misfortunes, could not refrain from expressing
his surprise.

"These honors," said the boy, "are not due from
you to us; neither in your father's dominions should
precedence be given to persons so destitute as we
are."

"Unfortunate though you be," answered the
count, "you are the son of the King of England,
while I am only the son of a ducal sovereign; and
that is not so high a rank."

Leaving Bruges with her son, Margaret was escorted
to Barr with all the honor due to the royal
rank. At Barr, the exiled queen was met and welcomed
by her father, King René, who gave her an
old castle in Verdun as a residence till better days
should come. Thither Margaret went to establish
her little court; and thither, to be educated in the
accomplishments in fashion at the period, she carried
the young prince around whom all her hopes
now clustered.

Two hundred Lancastrians of name and reputation[Pg 185]
shared the exile of Margaret of Anjou. Among
these were Lord Kendal, a Gascon; the Bishop of
St. Asaph, the young Lord De Roos and his kinsman,
Sir Henry; John Courtenay, younger brother
of Devon's Earl; Edmund Beaufort, the new Duke
of Somerset, and his brother John, whom the Lancastrians
called Marquis of Dorset; Henry Holland,
Duke of Exeter       always, notwithstanding his relationship
to Edward, faithful to the Red Rose; Jasper
Tudor, who clung to Lancaster as if with a prophetic
notion that with the fortunes of the house
were associated those of his own family; John Morton,
Parson of Blokesworth, whose talents subsequently
made him a cardinal and an archbishop;
and Sir John Fortescue, Chief Justice of England,
one of the most upright judges who ever wore the
ermine. Such men, when the fortunes of the house
of Lancaster were at their worst, were prepared to
suffer poverty and want in Henry's cause.

The banished queen could ill brook the obscurity
of Verdun. It soon appeared that, notwithstanding
so many disheartening reverses, Margaret retained
her courage unimpaired; and that want, disappointment,
mortification, had been unable to break her
spirit or conquer her ambition. Hardly had the
court of the exiles been formed at Verdun, when the
queen renewed her efforts to regain the crown which
she had already found so thorny.

[Pg 186]

At that time Alphonso the Fifth reigned in Portugal;
and Portugal was rich, owing to the quantity
of gold yearly brought from Guinea. Moreover,
King Alphonso was a remarkable man. In
his fiery nature were blended all the elements of
love, chivalry, and religion; and though living in
the fifteenth century he resembled a paladin of the
age of Roland and Oliver. Through his grandmother,
Philippa of Lancaster, Alphonso inherited
the blood of John of Gaunt; and it was supposed
that he would naturally feel much of that sympathy
for the house of Lancaster which had been ever expressed
by the Count of Charolois.

Accordingly, Margaret turned her eyes toward
Portugal for aid, and employed John Butler, Earl
of Ormond, to enlist Alphonso in her cause. Ormond,
who, upon the execution of his brother, the
Earl of Wiltshire, after Towton, had become the
chief of the Butlers, was one of the most accomplished
gentlemen of his age, and a master of the
various languages then spoken in Europe. No fitter
embassador could have been found; but he was
not successful. In fact, although Alphonso was all
his life engaged in chimerical enterprises, he could
hardly have indulged in the delusion of being able
to wrest a crown from Edward Plantagenet and
Richard Neville. Not even that knight-errant
would risk reputation against such odds. At all[Pg 187]
events the negotiation appears to have come to
naught; and Ormond, doubtless, convinced that the
fortunes of Lancaster were hopeless, returned to
England, and made his submission. Edward restored
the accomplished nobleman to the honors
and estates of the Butlers, with a complimentary
remark. "If good-breeding and liberal qualities,"
said the king, "were lost in all the world, they
would still be found in the Earl of Ormond."

About the time when Ormond's mission failed,
Margaret received intelligence that her husband had
fallen into the hands of her enemies. Finding, perhaps,
that Scottish hospitality was hard to bear,
Henry, about a year after Hexham, removed to the
north of England, and in July, 1465, while sitting
at dinner in Waddington Hall, he was seized by Sir
John Harrington, and sent prisoner to London. At
Islington the captive king was met by Warwick,
who lodged him securely in the Tower; and Henry,
treated with humanity, forgot, in the practice of a
monkish devotion, the crown he had lost and the
world he had left.

The captivity of their king was not the only misfortune
which, at this period, befell the Lancastrians.
In 1467, Harleck Castle, their last strong-hold, was
under the necessity of yielding. Davydd ap Jefan
ap Einion held out to the last; but when the garrison
was on the point of starvation, the brave Welsh[Pg 188]
captain listened to the dictates of humanity, and surrendered
with honor.

Even after the fall of Harleck, Margaret's high
spirit sustained her hopes. In 1467, she is understood
to have come to London, disguised as a priest,
to rouse her partisans to action, and even to have
had an interview with her husband in the Tower.
Next year she sent Jasper Tudor to Wales; and he
laid siege to Denbigh. King Edward himself was
in the castle, and the utmost peril of being taken
prisoner. He contrived to escape, however; and
the fortress surrendered. But a Yorkist named
William Herbert went with an army, and inflicted
such a defeat on Jasper that he was fain to escape
to the Continent. Nevertheless, in October, Margaret
lay at Harfleur threatening an invasion. Edward,
however, sent his brother-in-law, Anthony
Woodville, who now, in right of his wife, figured as
Lord Scales, to attack the fleet of his old patroness;
and the exiled queen, seeing no chance of success,
abandoned her expedition in despair.

But even in despair Margaret could show herself
heroic and sublime. Thus, when some of her Continental
kinsfolk were, in a vulgar spirit, lamenting
her unfortunate marriage, and describing her union
with the unhappy Henry as the cause of all her misfortune,
she raised her head with regal pride, and
contemptuously rebuked their foolish talk. "On the
day of my betrothal," exclaimed she, with poetic[Pg 189]
eloquence, "when I accepted the Rose of England,
I knew that I must wear the rose entire and with
all its thorns."

In the midst of adversity the exiled queen had
one consolation. Edward, Prince of Wales, was a
son of whom any mother might have been proud,
and day by day he grew more accomplished in the
warlike exercises of the age. Nor, though in almost
hopeless adversity, did the prince lack instruction
in weightier matters; for Fortescue undertook
the task of educating the banished heir of Lancaster,
endeavored so to form the mind of the royal
boy as to enable him to enact in after years the part
of a patriot-king, and compiled for his pupil the "De
Laudibus Legum Angliæ;" a work explaining the
laws of England, and suggesting the improvements
that might with advantage be introduced.

Five years of exile passed over; and during that
time every attempt of the Lancastrians to better their
position proved disastrous. It was when matters
were at the worst       when the Red Rose had disappeared,
and the Red Rose-tree had withered from
England       that circumstances occurred which inspired
the despairing adherents of the captive king
with high hopes, diverted the thoughts of the exiled
queen from reminiscences of the past to speculations
on the future, and opened up to her son the
prospect of a throne, only to conduct him to an
untimely grave.



[Pg 190]




CHAPTER XX.

WARWICK AND THE WOODVILLES.


At a court, over which Elizabeth Woodville exercised
all the influence derived from her rank as a
queen and her fascination as a woman, the Earl of
Warwick was somewhat out of place. By Woodvilles,
Herberts, and Howards, he was regarded with
awe and envy as the haughtiest representative of
England's patricians. Especially to the queen and
her kinsmen his presence was irksome; and, knowing
that any attempt to make "The Stout Earl" a
courtier after the Woodville pattern was hopeless
as to convert a bird of prey into a barn-door fowl,
they were at no pains to conceal the pleasure they
felt in mortifying his pride and destroying his influence.
One possibility does not seem to have struck
them. The Woodvilles themselves, to receive benefits,
had been suddenly converted from the Red Rose
to the White; Warwick, to avenge the nation's injuries
and his own, might as suddenly be converted
from the White Rose to the Red.

Notwithstanding the exile of Lancastrians and the
discontent of Yorkists, no court in Christendom was
more brilliant than that of King Edward. Indeed,[Pg 191]
foreign embassadors confessed, with mingled envy
and admiration, that their eyes were dazzled by the
surpassing loveliness of the damsels who appeared
at state balls in the Palace of Westminster; and
among these fair beings, perhaps, none was more interesting
than the king's sister, Margaret, youngest
daughter of Richard Plantagenet and Cicely Neville.

Two daughters of the Duke of York were already
wives. Both had been married to English dukes       one
to Exeter, another to Suffolk; and it was known
that Edward, having, by his union with Elizabeth
Woodville, lost the opportunity of allying himself
with the Continental dynasties, contemplated for
his remaining sister a marriage with some foreign
prince capable of aiding him in case of a change of
fortune.

Suitors were not, of course, wanting when so fair
a princess as Margaret Plantagenet was to be won;
and it happened that while Warwick was at feud with
the Woodvilles       while the populace were clamoring
against the new men with whom the king's court
swarmed       her hand was contended for by Louis of
France, for a prince of the blood royal, and by Louis
of Bruges for the Count of Charolois, who, since his
interview with Margaret of Anjou, had taken up
arms against Louis and defeated him in the battle
of Montlhéry. The choice was a matter of some
difficulty; for the Woodvilles and Warwick took[Pg 192]
different sides of the question. The queen's kindred
favored the suit of the Count of Charolois;
while "The Stout Earl," between whom and the
Burgundian no amity existed, declared decidedly
for an alliance with France. Edward was in some
perplexity, but at length he yielded to the earl's
arguments; and, in 1467, the frank, unsuspecting
king-maker departed to negotiate a marriage with
that celebrated master of kingcraft, whose maxim
was, that he who knew not how to dissemble knew
not how to reign.

When Louis heard of Warwick's embassy he
could not help thinking the occasion favorable for
the exercise of his craft. He resolved to give the
earl such a reception as might stir the jealousy of
Edward, and acted in such a manner as to create in
the breast of the English king suspicions of the powerful
noble who had placed him on a throne. Having
landed at Harfleur, Warwick was, on the 7th
of June, conveyed in a barge to the village of La
Bouille, on the Seine. On arriving at La Bouille,
he found a magnificent banquet prepared for him,
and the king ready to act as host. After having
been sumptuously feasted, Warwick embarked in his
boat for Rouen, whither the king and his attendants
went by land; and the inhabitants of the town met
the earl at the gate of the Quay St. Eloy, where the
king had ordered a most honorable reception. Banners,[Pg 193]
crosses, and holy water were then presented to
Warwick by priests in their copes; and he was conducted
in procession to the cathedral, where he made
his oblation, and thence to lodgings prepared for him
at the monastery of the Jacobins.

Having thus received Warwick with the honors
usually paid to royalty, Louis entertained the great
earl in a style corresponding with the reception;
and even ordered the queen and princesses to come
to Rouen to testify their respect. The crafty king,
meantime, did not refrain from those mischievous
tricks at which he was such an adept. While Warwick
staid at Rouen Louis lodged in the next house,
and visited the earl at all hours, passing through a
private door with such an air of mystery, as might,
when reported to Edward, raise suspicions that some
conspiracy had been hatching.

After the conference at Rouen had lasted for
twelve days, Louis departed for Chartres, and Warwick
set sail for England. The earl had been quite
successful in the object of his mission; and he was
accompanied home by the Archbishop of Narbonne,
charged by Louis to put the finishing stroke to the
treaty which was to detach the French king forever
from the Lancastrian alliance.

Meanwhile, the Woodvilles had not been idle.
Far from submitting patiently to the earl's triumph,
they had labored resolutely to mortify his pride and[Pg 194]
frustrate his mission. The business was artfully
managed. Anthony Woodville, in the name of the
ladies of England, revived an old challenge to Anthony,
Count de la Roche, an illegitimate son of the
Duke of Burgundy; and the count, commonly called
"The Bastard of Burgundy," having accepted the
challenge, with the usual forms, intimated his intention
to come to England without delay.

The news crept abroad that a great passage of
arms was to take place; and the highest expectations
were excited by the prospect. The king himself
entered into the spirit of the business, consented
to act as umpire, and made such arrangements as, it
was conceived, would render the tournament memorable.
Several months were spent in adjusting the
preliminaries; and the noblest knights of France
and Scotland were invited to honor the tournament
with their presence.

At length the Bastard of Burgundy arrived in
London with a splendid retinue; and lists were
erected in Smithfield, with pavilions for the combatants,
and galleries around for the ladies of Edward's
court and other noble personages who had
been invited to witness the pageant. On the 11th
of June, all the ceremonies prescribed by the laws
of chivalry having been performed, the combatants
prepared for the encounter, and advanced on horseback
from their pavilions into the middle of the inclosed[Pg 195]
space. After having answered the usual
questions, they took their places in the lists, and, at
the sound of trumpet, spurred their steeds and
charged each other with sharp spears. Both champions,
however, bore themselves fairly in the encounter,
and parted with equal honor.

On the second day of the Smithfield tournament,
the result was somewhat less gratifying to the Burgundian.
On this occasion the champions again
fought on horseback; and, as it happened, the steed
of Anthony Woodville had a long and sharp pike of
steel on his chaffron. This weapon was destined to
have great influence on the fortunes of the day; for,
while the combatants were engaged hand to hand,
the pike's point entered the nostrils of the Bastard's
steed, and the animal, infuriated by the pain, reared
and plunged till he fell on his side. The Bastard
was, of course, borne to the ground; and Anthony
Woodville, riding round about with his drawn sword,
asked his opponent to yield. At this point, the
marshals, by the king's command, interfered, and
extricated the Burgundian from his fallen steed.
"I could not hold me by the clouds," exclaimed the
brave Bastard; "but, though my horse fail me, I
will not fail my encounter." The king, however,
decided against the combat being then renewed.

Another day arrived, and the champions, armed
with battle-axes, appeared on foot within the lists.[Pg 196]
This day proved as unfortunate for the Bastard as
the former had been. Both knights, indeed, bore
themselves valiantly; but, at a critical moment, the
point of Woodville's axe penetrated the sight-hole
of his antagonist's helmet, and, availing himself of
this advantage, Anthony was on the point of so
twisting his weapon as to bring the Burgundian to
his knee. At that instant, however, the king cast
down his warder, and the marshals hastened to sever
the combatants. The Bastard, having no relish for
being thus worsted, declared himself far from content,
and demanded of the king, in the name of justice,
that he should be allowed to perform his enterprise.
Edward thereupon appealed to the marshals;
and they, having considered the matter, decided
that by the laws of the tournament the Burgundian
was entitled to have his demand granted;
but that, in such a case, he must be delivered to his
adversary in precisely the same predicament as when
the king interfered       in fact, with the point of Anthony
Woodville's weapon thrust into the crevice
of his visor: "which," says Dugdale, "when the
Bastard understood, he relinquished his farther challenge."

The tournament at Smithfield, unlike "the gentle
passage at Ashby," terminated without bloodshed.
Indeed, neither Anthony Woodville nor his
antagonist felt any ambition to die in their harness[Pg 197]
in the lists; and the Bastard, in visiting England,
had a much more practical object in view than to
afford amusement to gossiping citizens. He was, in
fact, commissioned by the Count of Charolois to press
the English king on the subject of a match with
Margaret of York; and he played his part so well
as to elicit from Edward, notwithstanding Warwick's
embassy, a promise that the hand of the princess
should be given to the heir of Burgundy. When
Warwick returned from France and found what had
been done in his absence, he considered that he had
been dishonored. Such usage would, at any time,
have grated hard on the earl's heart; and the idea
of the Woodvilles having been the authors of this
wrong made his blood boil with indignation. He
forthwith retired to Middleham, in a humor the reverse
of serene, and there brooded over his wrongs
in a mood the reverse of philosophic.

The king did not allow the king-maker's anger to
die for want of fuel. On the contrary, having given
Warwick serious cause of offense, he added insult to
injury by pretending that the earl had been gained
over by Louis to the Lancastrian cause, and that
the state was in no small danger from his treasonable
attempts. At the same time, he abruptly deprived
George Neville, Archbishop of York,[8] of the[Pg 198]
office of chancellor       thus indicating still farther distrust
of the great family to whose efforts he owed
his crown.

While rumors as to Warwick's new-born sympathies
with the house of Lancaster were afloat, the
Castle of Harleck fell into the king's hands. Within
the fortress was taken an agent of Margaret; and
he, on being put to the rack, declared that Warwick,
during his mission to France, had, at Rouen, spoken
with favor of the exiled queen, during a confidential
conversation with Louis. Warwick treated the accusation
with contempt, and declined to leave his
castle to be confronted with the accuser.

This unfortunate incident was little calculated to
smooth the way for a reconciliation. Nevertheless,[Pg 199]
the Archbishop of York, who had a keen eye for
his own interest, undertook to mediate between his
brother and the king. The churchman was successful
in his efforts; and in July, 1468, when Margaret
Plantagenet departed from England for her
new home, Warwick rode before her, through the
city of London, as if to indicate by his presence that
he had withdrawn his objections to her marriage
with the Count of Charolois, who, in the previous
year, on the death of his father, had succeeded to
the ducal sovereignty of Burgundy.

The chroniclers might with propriety have described
this as a second "dissimulated love-day."
No true reconcilement could take place between
the king and the king-maker. Warwick considered
Edward the most ungrateful of mankind; and the
king thought of the earl, as the Regent-Duke of
Albany said of the third Lord Home, that "he
was too great to be a subject." The king regarded
Warwick's patriotic counsel with aversion: the
earl's discontent could be read by the multitude in
his frank face. Each, naturally, began to calculate
his strength.

Edward had one source of consolation. In giving
his sister to Burgundy he had gained a potent ally
on the Continent; and he rejoiced to think that, in
the event of a change of fortune, a relative so near
would assuredly befriend him. Edward, like other[Pg 200]
men, deceived himself on such subjects. He little
imagined how soon he would have to ask his brother-in-law's
protection, and how he should find that Burgundy,
while taking a wife from the house of York,
had not quite laid his prejudices in favor of the
house of Lancaster.

Warwick, on his part, felt aught rather than satisfied.
Notwithstanding his appearance at court, he
was brooding over the injury that he had received.
Convinced of the expediency of making friends, he
addressed himself to the king's brothers       George,
Duke of Clarence, and Richard, Duke of Gloucester.
Of Gloucester the earl could make nothing.
The wily boy played with his dagger as he was
wont, and maintained such a reserve that it would
have been imprudent to trust him. With Clarence
the earl had more success. Indeed, the duke complained
of the king's unkindness; and particularly
that though Edward had given rich heiresses to
Dorset and Woodville, he had found no match for
his own brother. Having both something of which
to complain, the earl and the duke formed an alliance
offensive and defensive; and a project was
formed for binding them to each other by a tie
which the Nevilles deemed could hardly be broken.

Warwick had not been blessed with a son to inherit
his vast estates, his great name, and his popularity,
which was quite undiminished. He, however,[Pg 201]
had two daughters       Isabel and Anne       whose
birth and lineage were such as to put them on a
level with any prince in Europe. It appears that
Isabel had inspired Clarence with an ardent attachment;
but the king and "the queen's kindred"
were averse to a match. Warwick now declared
that the marriage should take place in spite of their
hostility; and Clarence agreed, for Isabel's sake, to
defy both Edward and the Woodvilles.

Having taken their resolution, the duke and the
earl, in the summer of 1469, sailed for Calais, of
which Warwick was still governor. Preparations
were made for uniting Clarence and Isabel; and in
the month of July, "in the Chapel of Our Lady," the
ill-starred marriage was solemnized with a pomp befitting
the rank of a Plantagenet bridegroom and a
Neville bride.

King Edward no sooner heard of this marriage
than he expressed strong displeasure. Unkind
words passed in consequence; and, from that date,
no affection existed between the king and the king-maker.
About the same time there appeared in
the heavens a comet, such as had been seen on the
eve of great national changes       as before Hastings,
which gave England to the Norman yoke, and Evesham,
which freed Englishmen from the domination
of a foreign baronage and an alien church. The superstitious
were immediately struck with the "blazing[Pg 202]
star," and expressed their belief that it heralded
a political revolution. Others did not look at the
sky for signs of a coming struggle. Indeed, those
who were capable of comprehending the events passing
before them could entertain little doubt that
England had not yet seen the last of the Wars of
the Roses.



[Pg 203]




CHAPTER XXI.

DESPOTISM, DISCONTENT, AND DISORDER.


While the Woodvilles were supreme, and while
Edward was under their influence disheartening the
ancient barons of England, and alienating the great
noble to whom he owed the proudest crown in
Christendom, the imprudent king did not ingratiate
himself with the multitude by any display of respect
for those rights and liberties to maintain which
Warwick had won Northampton and Towton. Indeed,
the government was disfigured by acts of undisguised
tyranny; and torture, albeit known to be
illegal in England, was freely used, as during the
Lancastrian rule, to extort evidence. Even the
laws of the first Edward and his great minister,
Robert de Burnel, were in danger of going as much
out of fashion as the chain armor in which Roger
Bigod and Humphrey Bohun charged at Lewes and
Evesham.

Edward's first victim was William Walker. This
man kept a tavern in Cheapside, known as "The
Crown," and there a club, composed of young men,
had been in the habit of meeting. These fell under
the suspicion of being Lancastrians, and were supposed[Pg 204]
to be plotting a restoration. No evidence to
that effect existed; but, unfortunately, the host, being
one day in a jocular mood, while talking to his
son, who was a boy, said, "Tom, if thou behavest
thyself, I'll make thee heir to the crown." Every
body knew that Walker's joke alluded to his sign;
yet, when the words were reported, he was arrested,
and, as if in mockery of common sense, indicted
for imagining and compassing the death of the king.
The prisoner pleaded his innocence of any evil intention,
but his protestations were of no avail. He
was found guilty, in defiance of justice, and hanged,
in defiance of mercy.

The next case, that of a poor cobbler, if not so
utterly unjust, was equally impolitic and still more
cruel. Margaret of Anjou was, at that time, using
every effort to regain her influence in England, and
many persons, supposed to possess letters from the
exiled queen, were tortured and put to death on
that suspicion. Of these the cobbler was one, and
one of the most severely punished. Having been
apprehended on the charge of aiding Margaret to
correspond with her partisans in England, he was
tortured to death with red-hot pincers.

Even when the sufferers were Lancastrians, the
barbarity of such proceedings could not fail to make
the flesh creep and the blood curdle; but the case
became still more iniquitous when government laid[Pg 205]
hands on men attached to the house of York; when
the Woodvilles, who had themselves been Lancastrians,
singled out as victims stanch partisans of
the White Rose.

Sir Thomas Cooke was one of the most reputable
citizens of London, and, in the second year of Edward's
reign, had fulfilled the highest municipal
functions. Unfortunately for him, also, he had the
reputation of being so wealthy as to tempt plunder.
Earl Rivers and the Duchess of Bedford appear to
have thought so; and exerted their influence with
the king to have the ex-mayor arrested on a charge
of treason, and committed to the Tower.

It appears that, in an evil hour for Cooke, a man
named Hawkins had called on him and requested
the loan of a thousand marks, on good security;
but Sir Thomas said he should, in the first place,
like to know for whom the money was, and, in the
second, for what purpose it was intended. Hawkins
frankly stated it was for the use of Queen Margaret;
and Cooke thereupon declined to lend a
penny. Hawkins went away, and the matter rested
for some time. Sir Thomas was not, however,
destined to escape; for Hawkins, having been taken
to the Tower and put to the brake, called "the Duke
of Exeter's daughter," confessed so much in regard
to himself that he was put to death; and at the
same time, under the influence of excessive pain,[Pg 206]
stated that Cooke had lent the money to Margaret
of Anjou.

The Woodvilles, having obtained such evidence
against their destined victim, seized upon Cooke's
house in London, ejecting his lady and servants,
and, at the same time, took possession of Giddy
Hall, his seat in Essex, where he had fish-ponds,
and a park full of deer, and household furniture of
great value. After thus appropriating the estate
of the city knight, they determined that, for form's
sake, he should have a trial; and accordingly a
commission, of which Earl Rivers was a member,
was appointed to sit at Guildhall. It would seem
that the Woodvilles, meanwhile, had no apprehension
of the result being unfavorable to their interests;
but, unfortunately for their scheme of appropriation,
the commission included two men who
loved justice and hated iniquity. These were Richard
Neville, Earl of Warwick, and Sir John Markham,
Chief Justice of England.

Markham was of a family of lawyers, whose progenitors,
though scarcely wealthier than yeomen, had
held their land from time immemorial, and been entitled
to carry coat armor. Having been early called
to the bar, and successful in his profession, he
became a puisne judge of the court of king's bench;
and having strongly supported the claims of the
house of York, and greatly contributed, by his abilities[Pg 207]
and learning, to the triumph of the White
Rose, he succeeded Fortescue as chief justice. But,
though zealous for the hereditary right of the house
of York, Markham was neither a minion nor a tool
of its members; and, though he could not but be
aware what the court expected, he was incapable of
doing any thing to forfeit the public respect which
he enjoyed as "The Upright Judge." When, therefore,
the evidence against Cooke had been taken,
and the whole case heard, the chief justice ruled
that the offense was not treason, but, at the most,
"Misprision of Treason," and directed the jury so
to find it.

The lands of Sir Thomas Cooke were saved, and
the Woodvilles, angry as wild beasts deprived of
their prey, vowed vengeance on the chief justice.
Accordingly Earl Rivers and his duchess pressed
Edward to dismiss the unaccommodating functionary;
and Edward swore that Markham should never
sit on the bench again. Markham, submitting with
a dignity becoming his high character, carried his integrity
into retirement; and Sir Thomas Cooke was
set free after he had paid an enormous fine.

Every man of intelligence must now have seen
that the Woodvilles would embroil Edward with
the nation. While the king was, under their influence,
perpetrating such enormities as caused grave
discontent, he was aroused to a sense of insecurity[Pg 208]
by formidable commotions in the north. For the
origin of these, the master and brethren of the Hospital
of St. Leonards appear to have been responsible.
The right of levying a thrave of corn from
every plow in the country for the relief of the
poor had, it seems, been granted to the hospital by
one of the Anglo-Saxon kings; but the rural population
complained that the revenue was not expended
for charitable purposes, but employed by the master
and brethren for their private advantage. After
long complaining, the people of the country refused
to pay, and, in retaliation, their goods were distrained
and their persons imprisoned. At length,
in 1469, finding they could get no redress, the recusants
took up arms, and, under a captain named
Robert Hulderne, they put the officers of the hospital
to the sword, and, to the number of fifteen
thousand, marched, in hostile array, to the gates of
York.

The insurgents, however, were not to have it all
their own way. Lord Montagu commanded in the
district; and he prepared to put down the rising
with that vigor and energy which had hitherto
characterized his military operations. Accordingly,
he hastened to bring them to an engagement.
A skirmish took place; the insurgents were scattered;
and Hulderne, their leader, having been taken,
was sent by Montagu to immediate execution. Nevertheless,[Pg 209]
the insurgents continued in arms; and,
having been joined by Lord Fitzhugh and Sir Henry
Neville, the son of Lord Latimer, one a nephew,
the other a cousin of Warwick, they placed Sir
John Conyers, a soldier of courage and experience,
at their head, advanced toward London, denouncing
the Woodvilles as taxers and oppressors, and loudly
demanding their dismissal from the council.

Edward now roused himself from voluptuous
lethargy, and prepared to defend his crown. Without
delay, he gave commissions to William Herbert,
whom he had created Earl of Pembroke, and
Humphrey Stafford, to whom, on the execution of
Hugh, Earl of Devon, at Salisbury, he had given
the heritage of the Courtenays, to march against the
rebels. At the same time, Edward buckled on his
armor, and advanced to Newark. There, however,
he thought it prudent to halt; and, finding his army
utterly weak and unsteady, he retreated to Nottingham.
Hitherto he had thought England none the
worse for Warwick's absence; but now he dispatched
a message to Calais, beseeching the earl and
Clarence to come to his assistance. Having thus
bent his pride, Edward waited the result with anxiety.

Meanwhile, Herbert and Stafford were in the field.
Hastily assembling seven thousand men, most of
whom were Welsh, the two Yorkist earls moved[Pg 210]
against the insurgents; but they had hardly done
so, when an unfortunate dispute involved them in
serious disasters.

It was at Banbury, when the royal army approached
the insurgents, that the quarrel took place.
It appears that the Yorkist earls had agreed, in the
course of their expedition, that when either took
possession of a lodging, he should be allowed to keep
it undisturbed. On reaching Banbury, on the 25th
of July, Stafford took up his quarters at an inn,
where there was a damsel for whom he had a partiality.
Herbert, who was so proud of the king's
letter that he could hardly contain his joy,[9] insisted
upon putting Stafford out of the hostelry; and Stafford,
whose spirit was high, took offense at being so
treated by an inferior. Angry words passed, and
the consequence was that Stafford mounted his horse,
and rode from the town, with his men-at-arms and
archers. Herbert, alarmed at being left alone, hastened
to the hill on which his soldiers were encamped,
and expressed his intention of abiding such fortune
as God should send.

[Pg 211]

When evening advanced, Sir Henry Neville, at
the head of his light-horse, commenced skirmishing
with the Welsh, and, advancing too far, he was surrounded
and slain. The northern men, thereupon,
vowed vengeance; and next morning, at Edgecote,
attacked the royal army with fury. Herbert, on
the occasion, bore himself with a courage which
well-nigh justified the king's favor; and his brother,
Richard, twice, by main force, hewed his way through
the insurgent ranks. Animated by the example of
their leaders, the Welshmen were on the point of
victory, when an esquire, named John Clapham, attended
by five hundred men, and bearing a white
bear, the banner of the king-maker, came up the hill,
shouting       "A Warwick! A Warwick!" Hearing
this war-cry, so terrible, and believing that "The
Stout Earl" was upon them, the Welshmen fled in
such terror and confusion that the northern men
slaughtered five thousand of them. Herbert and
his brother Richard, having been taken, were carried
to Banbury, and there beheaded, in revenge for
the death of Sir Henry Neville. Elate with their
victory at Banbury, the insurgents resolved upon
giving a lesson to the "queen's kindred;" and,
choosing for their captain Robert Hilyard, whom
men called "Robin of Redesdale," they marched to
the Manor of Grafton, seized on Earl Rivers and
John Woodville, who had wedded the old Duchess[Pg 212]
of Norfolk, carried these obnoxious individuals to
Nottingham, and there beheaded them as taxers and
oppressors.

The king, on hearing of the defeat of Herbert and
the execution of the Woodvilles, expressed the utmost
resentment. Displeased with himself and every
body else, he looked around for a victim on
whom to wreak his fury; and, considering that of
all connected with these misfortunes Stafford was
the least blameless, he issued orders that the unfortunate
nobleman should be seized, and dealt with as
a traitor. The royal commands were obeyed. Stafford
was taken at a village in Brentmarsh, carried
to Bridgewater, and executed.

The aspect of affairs gradually became more
threatening. At length Warwick arrived in England,
and repaired to the king, who was encamped
at Olney. He found Edward in no enviable plight.
His friends were killed or scattered, and his enemies
close upon him. The earl was just the man
for such a crisis, and he consented to exercise his
influence. He went to the insurgents, promised to
see their grievances redressed, spoke to them in that
popular strain which he alone could use; and, at
his bidding, they dispersed and went northward.
Edward, however, found that he was hardly more
free than when the forces of Robin of Redesdale
hemmed him in. The earl, in fact, took the king[Pg 213]
into his own hands till he should redeem his promise
to the insurgents, and conveyed him, as a kind
of prisoner, to the Castle of Middleham.

Edward had no intention of granting the popular
demands; and he was not the man to submit patiently
to durance. He gained the hearts of his
keepers, and obtained liberty to go a-hunting. This
privilege he turned to account; and having one day
been met by Sir William Stanley, Sir Thomas
Brough, and others of his friends, he rode with them
to York, pursued his way to Lancaster, and, having
there been met by Lord Hastings, reached London
in safety.

A peace between Warwick and the king was
brought about by their friends; and Edward's eldest
daughter was betrothed to Montagu's son. But
a few weeks after this reconciliation, the earl took
mortal offense. The cause is involved in some mystery.
It appears, however, that Edward had two
failings in common with many men both small and
great       a weakness for wine and a weakness for
women. He was much too fond of deep drinking,
and by no means free from the indiscretions of those
who indulge to excess in the social cup. On some
occasion, it would seem, the king was guilty of a
flagrant impropriety which touched the honor and
roused the resentment of the earl. Even at this
day the exact circumstances are unknown; but, in[Pg 214]
the fifteenth century, rumor was not silent on the
subject. Hall has indicated, in language somewhat
too plain for this generation, that the offense was an
insult offered by the king, in Warwick's house, to
the niece or daughter of the earl; and adds, that
"the certainty was not for both their honors openly
known." But, however that may have been, the
strife between the king and the king-maker now assumed
the character of mortal enmity, and led rapidly
to those events which rendered the year 1470
memorable in the annals of England.

Edward was not long left in doubt as to the earl's
views. At the Moor, in Hertfordshire, which then
belonged to the Archbishop of York, which passed
fifteen years later to John de Vere, Earl of Oxford,
and which, in later days, became the seat of Anne
Scott, heiress of Buccleuch and widow of the ill-fated
Monmouth, George Neville, one day in the month of
February, gave a banquet to the king. On the occasion
Warwick and Clarence were invited; and all
was going on well, and Edward was washing his
hands before sitting down to supper, when one of his
attendants whispered that armed men were lurking
near the house to seize him. The king started, but,
recovering himself sufficiently to betray no signs of
alarm, he got secretly out of the house, mounted his
horse, and, riding all night, reached Windsor Castle
in safety.

[Pg 215]

Edward was not quite prepared to punish this attempt
on his liberty. He, therefore, listened to the
mediation of the Duchess of York; and that lady
was laboring to effect another reconciliation, when
an insurrection took place among the people of Lincolnshire.
These complained bitterly of the oppression
of the royal purveyors; and they were headed
by Sir Robert Welles, the heir of a family remarkable
for fidelity to the house of Lancaster.

Warwick was suspected to be the author of this
disturbance. Nevertheless, the king found it necessary
to treat the earl and Clarence as if he entertained
no suspicion. He even intrusted them with
the command of forces destined to suppress the insurgents,
while he prepared to march against them
with a numerous army.

Meanwhile, the king sent for Lord Welles, father
of Sir Robert, and, at the royal summons, that nobleman
came to Westminster, in company with Sir
Thomas Dymoke, who had married his daughter.
Being informed, however, that the king was much
incensed, the Lancastrian lord and his son-in-law
deemed it prudent to repair to the sanctuary. Edward,
however, plighted his word as a prince, that
he intended no harm, and they, fully relying on a
pledge so sacred, came to his presence. Edward,
thereupon, commanded Lord Welles to write to his
son to desist from his enterprise; but Sir Robert[Pg 216]
continuing firm in spite of the paternal admonition,
Edward caused both the old lord and his son-in-law
to be executed.

After this faithless proceeding Edward left London.
Marching against the insurgents, he came up
with them on the 13th of March, at Erpingham, in
the county of Rutland. The royal army was so
superior in number that Sir Robert had scarcely a
chance of victory. Exasperated, however, by the
execution of his father, the brave knight, setting
prudence at defiance, was eager for an encounter.
The armies joined battle, and it soon appeared that
Sir Robert had reckoned without his host. The
conflict was utterly unequal; and, the insurgents
having been worsted, their leader was taken prisoner.
No sooner was Welles in the hands of the
enemy than the Lincolnshire men whom he had
commanded became a mob, and fled from the field,
having previously thrown off their coats, that their
running might not be impeded. From this circumstance
the battle was popularly spoken of as "Losecote
Field."

The tables were now turned. The king was in
a condition to defy Warwick, while the king-maker
had no means of raising such a force as could, with
any chance of success, encounter the royal army
flushed with victory. The earl, however, made one
effort. Being at his Castle of Warwick, and hearing[Pg 217]
of Edward's victory at Erpingham, he endeavored
to draw Lord Stanley, his brother-in-law, to his
side. Stanley, however, was far too prudent a man
to rush into danger even for his great kinsman's
sake. He answered that "he would never make
war against King Edward;" and Warwick and
Clarence were compelled to turn toward Dartmouth.



[Pg 218]




CHAPTER XXII.

THE SIEGE OF EXETER.


On the summit of the hill that rises steeply from
the left bank of the River Exe, and is crowned with
the capital of Devon, some of the burghers of Exeter
might have been met with, one spring day in 1470,
gossiping about the king and Lord Warwick, and
making observations on several hundreds of armed
men, who, not without lance, and plume, and pennon,
were escorting a youthful dame, of patrician
aspect and stately bearing, toward the city gates.
The mayor and aldermen were, probably, the reverse
of delighted with the appearance of these
fighting men. Indeed, the warlike strangers were
adherents of Warwick and Clarence, escorting the
young duchess who was daughter of one and wife
of the other; and at that time, as was well known,
both "The Stout Earl" and the fickle duke were at
enmity with King Edward. The citizens of Exeter,
however, made a virtue of necessity, and cheerfully
enough admitted within their walls those whom they
had not the power to exclude.

At that time Isabel, Duchess of Clarence, was
about to become, under mortifying circumstances,[Pg 219]
the mother of a son "born to perpetual calamity;"
but, however delicate her situation, Lord Warwick's
daughter, reared in the midst of civil strife, was
probably less troubled than might be imagined
with uneasiness as to the present or apprehension
as to the future, as, with all honors due to her rank,
she was conducted to the palace of the Bishop of
Exeter.

The Duchess of Clarence soon had need of her
hereditary courage; for she had scarcely been lodged
in the bishop's palace, and the lords who attended
her in the houses of the canons, when Sir Hugh
Courtenay, sheriff of Devon, took the opportunity
of displaying his zeal in the king's service, raised an
army in the vicinity, and marched toward Exeter to
the assault of the city. Perceiving, however, that
its reduction must be the work of time, the sheriff
encamped his men around the walls, barricaded the
roads, stopped every avenue by which provisions
could have reached the garrison, and appeared prepared
to proceed deliberately with the siege. Having
taken these measures, Courtenay sent a messenger
to the mayor, demanding that the gates should
be opened forthwith.

The mayor and the other municipal functionaries
were by no means willing to incur the wrath of Edward
of York. On the contrary, they were much
inclined to entitle themselves to his favor by complying[Pg 220]
with the sheriff's demand. But Warwick's
friends were on their guard. Suspecting that the
mayor might prove untrue, and resolved to have
their fate in their own hands, the lords and gentlemen
insisted on the keys of the city being placed in
their possession; and, the mayor yielding on this
point, they appointed the watch, manned the walls,
repaired the gates, and took the entire management
of the defense. Finding themselves in a somewhat
delicate predicament, and not free from danger, the
mayor and aldermen resolved to speak both parties
fair, and do nothing till one side or other proved
triumphant.

At first Warwick's red-jackets made so brave a
defense that Courtenay could not boast of any progress.
Ere long, however, they had to contend with
a more formidable foe than the knightly sheriff.
After the siege had lasted some days, provisions fell
short; famine was apprehended; and the inhabitants
became inconveniently impatient. The Warwickers,
however, were utterly disinclined to yield.
Indeed, with the fate of Lord Welles and Sir Thomas
Dymoke before their eyes, they might well hesitate
to trust to Edward's tender mercies. They,
therefore, determined to endure all privations rather
than submit, and declared their intention to hold out
till God sent them deliverance. This resolution
might have been difficult to maintain; but, after the[Pg 221]
siege had lasted for twelve days, they were relieved
by the arrival of Warwick and Clarence.

The earl did not arrive at Exeter with laurels on
his brow. At Erpingham, Edward had already encountered
the insurgents under Sir Robert Welles;
and, having made the northern men fly before his
lance, he had proclaimed Warwick and Clarence
traitors, and offered a reward for their apprehension.
Disappointed of Lord Stanley's alliance, and
of aid from Sir John Conyers, the earl and the duke
joined their friends in haste and alarm. Resistance
was simply out of the question, for the king was at
the head of an army of forty thousand men; and
the king-maker had merely the yeomanry of the
county of Warwick. The earl's game was clearly
up for the present; and his only chance of safety
appeared to lie in a retreat to the Continent. He,
therefore, caused ships to be immediately fitted out
at Dartmouth; and, going to that port, after a three
days' stay in Exeter, he sailed for Calais, of which
he still continued captain.

Meanwhile, the king, flushed with his victory over
the Lincolnshire men, learned that Warwick had
gone toward Exeter. Thither, at the head of his
army, marched Edward, accompanied by a band of
nobles, among whom were the Dukes of Norfolk and
Suffolk, the Earls of Arundel and Rivers, and the
Lords Stanley and Hastings. The citizens, uncomfortable,[Pg 222]
no doubt, at having harbored the enemies
of a prince so potent, resolved upon doing all in their
power to entitle themselves to his favor. On hearing
of the approach of the royal army, the mayor
issued orders that every inhabitant having the
means should provide himself with a gown of the
city's livery, and hold himself in readiness to give
the king a loyal reception.

At length, on the 14th of April, Edward's banners
appeared in sight; and the mayor, attended
by the recorder and four hundred of the citizens,
clad in scarlet, issued forth from the gates to bid
the king welcome. The scene was such as had generally
been witnessed on such occasions. The mayor
made a humble obeisance; the recorder delivered
an oration, congratulating Edward on coming to
Exeter. This ceremony over, the mayor presented
the king with the keys of the city and a purse containing
a hundred nobles in gold. Edward returned
the keys; but "the gold," says the historian,
"he took very thankfully."

Having thus propitiated the conqueror, the mayor
of Exeter, his head uncovered, and bearing the mace
of the city in his hands, conducted the king through
the gate and toward the house which he was to
occupy. After remaining a few days in Exeter,
Edward returned to London, congratulating himself
on having put under his feet so many of his enemies,[Pg 223]
and out of the kingdom the great noble to
whom he owed his crown. He seemed to think the
whole quarrel between the people of England and
the family of Woodville decided in favor of his wife's
kindred by the flight of the Lancastrians from Erpingham
and the earl's retreat from Exeter.



[Pg 224]




CHAPTER XXIII.

LOUIS THE CRAFTY.


When Warwick sailed from Dartmouth as a mortal
foe of the man whom, ten years earlier, he had
seated on the throne of the Plantagenets, the excitement
created by the event was not confined to England.
So grand was the earl's fame, so high his
character, so ardent his patriotism, and so great the
influence he had exercised over that nation of which
he was the pride, that Continental princes listened to
the news of his breaking with Edward as they would
have done to that of an empire in convulsions. The
circumstances of the King of France and the Duke
of Burgundy especially were such that they could
not have remained indifferent to what was passing;
and lively, indeed, was the interest which Charles
the Rash and Louis the Crafty exhibited on the occasion.

Sir Walter Scott has rendered Louis, with his peculiarities
of mind, manner, and dress, familiar to
the readers of "Quentin Durward." At the mention
of his name there rises before the mind's eye a
man of mean figure, with pinched features, a threadbare
jerkin, and low fur cap, ornamented with paltry[Pg 225]
leaden images       now indulging in ribald talk,
now practicing the lowest hypocrisy, and now taking
refuge in the grossest superstition. Our concern
with him at present, however, is only so far as his
career is associated with the Wars of the Roses.

Louis was the son of the seventh Charles of
France, and of his queen, Mary of Anjou, a princess
of worth and virtue, but not tenderly beloved by her
husband, whose heart was devoted to his mistress,
Agnes Sorrel, the handsomest woman of that age.
Born at the commencement of those operations which
resulted in the expulsion of the English from France,
Louis had just reached the age of sixteen in 1440,
when, to get rid of his tutor, the Count de Perdriac,
he stole from the Castle of Loches, and conspired
against his father's government. The conspiracy
came to naught, and Louis was pardoned; but, a
few years later, he incurred the suspicion of having
poisoned Agnes Sorrel, and, flying from his father's
court, sought refuge in Dauphiny.

Enraged at the death of his mistress and the conduct
of his son, the king, in 1446, sent a band of
armed men to arrest the heir of France; and placed
at their head the Count of Dammartin. Louis,
however, received timely warning, and projected an
escape. With this view, he appointed a grand hunting-match,
ordered his dinner to be prepared at the
particular rendezvous, and took care that the count[Pg 226]
was informed of the circumstance. Completely deceived,
Dammartin placed troops in ambush, and
made certain of a capture; but Louis valued life
and liberty too much to allow himself to be caught.
Instead of going to the hunt, he mounted a fleet
steed, and, riding to the territories of the Duke of
Burgundy, was courteously received and entertained
by that magnate.

On hearing that Burgundy had treated the dauphin
so handsomely, King Charles protested, and
warned the duke against heaping benefits on a man
of so depraved a disposition. "You know not, Duke
Philip," said the king, "the nature of this savage
animal. You cherish a wolf, who will one day tear
your sheep to pieces. Remember the fable of the
countryman, who, in compassion to a viper which
he found half frozen in the field, brought it to his
house, and warmed it by the fireside, till it turned
round and hissed at its preserver." The good duke,
however, continued to protect Louis, granted him
a pension to maintain his state, and gave him the
choice of a residence. Louis selected the Castle of
Gennape, in Brabant; and, during his residence
there, formed a close intimacy with the duke's son,
the Count of Charolois, afterward celebrated as
Charles the Rash.

The heir of Burgundy was some years younger
than the dauphin, and in character presented a remarkable[Pg 227]
contrast with the exiled prince, being violent,
ungovernable, and, in all cases, ruled by his
anger and pride. Round this incarnation of feudalism
Louis had the art to wind himself, as the ivy
does around the oak it is destined to destroy. They
feasted together, hawked together, hunted together,
and, in fact, were bosom friends; and when, in 1456,
Isabel de Bourbon, the first wife of Charles, gave
birth to a daughter, at Brussels, it was Louis who
figured as sponsor at the baptism of the infant
princess; and it was Louis who gave Mary of Burgundy
her Christian name, in honor of his mother,
Mary of Anjou.

When the dauphin had for years enjoyed the
Duke of Burgundy's hospitality, Charles the Seventh
died; and, shortly after the battle of Towton,
the exiled prince, at the age of thirty-eight, succeeded
to the crown of St. Louis. Hardly, however, had
the dauphin become king, when he forgot all his
obligations to the house which had sheltered him in
adversity. Eager to weaken the influence of the
two great feudatories of France, he sought to create
hostility between the Duke of Brittany and the
Count of Charolois. With this object he granted
each of them the government of Normandy, in hopes
of their contesting it, and destroying each other.
Discovering the deception, however, they united
against the deceiver, rallied around them the malcontents[Pg 228]
of France, and placed at their head the
king's brother, Charles de Valois, who claimed Normandy
as his appanage.

A formidable alliance, called "The League for
the Public Good," having been formed, Charolois,
attended by the Count of St. Pol, and the Bastard
of Burgundy, who afterward tilted at Smithfield
with Anthony Woodville, led his forces into France
in hostile array. Louis, though taken by surprise,
girded himself up for a conflict, and, on the 16th of
July, 1465, met his foes at Montlhéry. A fierce
battle followed; and the king fought with courage.
The day, however, went against France; and Louis
was forced to leave the field, with the loss of some
hundreds of his men and several of his captains,
among whom was one who, in the Wars of the
Roses, had spent a fortune, and enacted a strange
and romantic part. For among the slain at Montlhéry,
was Sir Peter de Brezé, celebrated for his
chivalrous admiration of Margaret of Anjou, who,
at the tournament given in France in honor of her
nuptials, had distinguished himself by feats of arms,
and who, when years of sorrow had passed over her
head, came to England to prove his devotion by
fighting for her husband's crown.

When Louis was under the necessity of abandoning
the field at Montlhéry to the heir of Burgundy,
Normandy revolted to the insurgent princes; and[Pg 229]
the king, finding himself the weaker party, had recourse
to dissimulation. He expressed his readiness
to negotiate, pretended to forget his resentment, surrendered
Normandy to his brother, satisfied the demands
of the Count of Charolois, and named the
Count of St. Pol Constable of France. But this
treaty negotiated at Conflans having, at the king's
desire, been annulled by the States-General, Louis
avenged himself by depriving Charles de Valois of
Normandy, and stirring up the rich cities of Flanders
to revolt against Charolois, now, by his father's
death, Duke of Burgundy, and, by his second marriage,
brother-in-law to Edward of York.

At the time when Louis was inciting the Flemings
to revolt against their sovereign, and when he had
an emissary in Liége for that purpose, he endeavored
to avert suspicion from himself by paying a visit to
Charles the Rash, at Peronne. This piece of diplomacy
well-nigh cost his life. Scarcely had the king
arrived at Peronne ere intelligence followed of the
revolt at Liége; and Burgundy was exasperated
in the highest degree to learn that the populace
had proceeded to horrible excesses, massacred the
canons, and murdered the bishop, Louis de Bourbon,
his own relative. But when, in addition to
all this, Burgundy heard that the king was the
author of the sedition, his rage knew no bounds.
He immediately committed Louis to prison, menaced[Pg 230]
the captive with death, and appeared determined
to execute his threat. Louis, however, became
aware of his peril, and submitted to all that
was demanded. To extricate himself from danger
he signed the treaty of Peronne, divesting himself
of all sovereignty over Burgundy, giving his brother
Champagne and Brie, and finally engaging to march
in person against the insurgents of Liége.

The treaty of Peronne restored Louis to liberty,
but not till he had played a part that must have
tried even his seared conscience. He was under
the necessity of accompanying Burgundy to Liége,
witnessing the destruction of the unfortunate city,
beholding a general massacre of the men whom
he had incited to revolt, and even congratulating
Charles the Rash on having executed vengeance.
All this time, however, Louis had no intention of
maintaining the treaty of Peronne. Indeed, he only
awaited a favorable opportunity of breaking faith;
but he deemed it policy to proceed cautiously, for
the alliance of Burgundy with Edward of York rendered
the duke formidable in his eyes.

At the opening of his reign Louis, notwithstanding
his relationship to Margaret of Anjou, had shown
a disinclination to make sacrifices for the house of
Lancaster; while Charles the Rash, as a descendant
of John of Gaunt, had expressed much sympathy
with the party whose badge was the Red Rose.[Pg 231]
Even kings, however, are the creatures of circumstances;
and the disposal which Edward, in his wisdom,
made of the hand of Margaret of York rendered
Burgundy favorable to the White Rose, while
it induced Louis, from selfish motives, to exhibit
more friendship for the adherents of Lancaster.

Louis had not a particle of chivalry in his composition,
and would have ridiculed the notion of undertaking
any thing for the advantage of others.
He was keenly alive to his own interest, however,
and deemed it politic to give the enemies of Edward
some degree of encouragement. To make them formidable
enough to keep the Yorkist king at home
was the object of his policy, for of all calamities
Louis most dreaded an English invasion. When
Warwick broke with Edward, he was not only freed
from fear, but animated by hope; for in the earl's
destiny he had perfect faith; and the earl was known
to entertain an antipathy to Burgundy, and a strong
opinion that peace with France was essential to England's
welfare.



[Pg 232]




CHAPTER XXIV.

"THE STOUT EARL" AND "THE FOREIGN WOMAN."


It was the spring of 1470 when Warwick left
the shores of England, accompanied by the Duke of
Clarence, by the Countess of Warwick, and by her
two daughters. The king-maker sailed toward
Calais, of which, since 1455, he had been captain-general.
At Calais Warwick expected welcome
and safety. Such, indeed, had been his influence in
the city in former days that his dismissal by the
Lancastrian king had proved an idle ceremony; and,
moreover, he relied with confidence on the fidelity
of Lord Vauclerc, a Gascon, whom, years before, he
had left as his deputy in the government.

Warwick was doomed to disappointment. News
of the earl's rupture with the king had preceded him
to Calais; and, as his ships approached the city of
refuge, Vauclerc, far from according to his patron
the anticipated welcome, ordered the artillery of the
fort to be pointed against the fleet. This was not
the worst. While the exiles, somewhat perplexed,
lay before Calais, the Duchess of Clarence became
a mother; and the earl appealed to the governor's
humanity to admit her into the city. But Vauclerc[Pg 233]
resolutely refused to countenance Edward's enemies,
and the Gascon was with no slight difficulty
persuaded to send on board two flagons of wine.
Even the privilege of baptism in the city, which
stood as a monument of the Continental triumphs
of the Plantagenets, was refused to the infant destined
to be the last male heir of that illustrious
race.

Vauclerc, however, gave the earl information by
no means valueless, in the shape of a warning that
on putting to sea he must beware where he landed,
as the myrmidons of Burgundy were on the watch
to seize him. At the same time, he took occasion
secretly to send an apology to Warwick, and to
represent his conduct as being entirely guided by
zeal for the earl's safety. "Calais," said he, "is
ill-supplied with provisions; the garrison can not
be depended on; the inhabitants, who live by the
English commerce, will certainly take part with the
established government; and the city is in no condition
to resist England on one side and Burgundy
on the other. It is better, therefore, that I should
seem to declare for Edward, and keep the fortress
in my power till it is safe to deliver it to you."
Warwick was not, probably, in a very credulous
mood; but he took Vauclerc's explanation for what
it was worth, ordered the anchors to be hauled up,
and, having defied Burgundy's enmity by seizing[Pg 234]
some Flemish ships that lay off Calais, sailed toward
the coast of Normandy.

King Edward, on hearing of Vauclerc's refusal to
admit Warwick, expressed himself highly pleased
with the deputy-governor, and manifested his approval
by sending the Gascon a patent as Captain-general
of Calais. Burgundy, not to be behind his
brother-in-law, dispatched Philip de Comines to announce
to Vauclerc that he should have a pension
of a thousand crowns for life, and to keep him true
to his principles. Vauclerc must have laughed in
his sleeve at all this. "Never man," says Sir
Richard Baker, "was better paid for one act of
dissembling."

Meanwhile, Warwick landed at Harfleur, where
his reception was all that could have been wished.
The governor welcomed the exiles with every token
of respect, escorted the ladies to Valognes, and hastened
to communicate Warwick's arrival to the king.
Louis exhibited the most unbounded confidence in
the earl's fortunes. Indeed, so confident in the
king-maker's alliance was the crafty monarch, that
he prepared to brave the united enmity of Edward
of England and Charles of Burgundy. Without
delay he invited the great exile to court; and, as
Warwick and Clarence       whom Warwick then intended
to place on the English throne       rode toward
Amboise, their journey excited the utmost curiosity.[Pg 235]
Every where the inhabitants were eager to see "The
Stout Earl;" and Jacques Bonnehomme came from
his cabin to gaze on the man who made and unmade
kings, and who, unlike the nobles of France, took
pride in befriending the people in peace and sparing
them in war.

At Amboise Warwick met with a reception which
must have been gratifying to his pride. Louis was
profuse of compliments and lavish of promises. The
French king, however, took occasion to suggest to
Warwick the expediency of finding some more adequate
instrument than Clarence wherewith to work
out his projects; and the English earl, bent on
avenging England's injuries and his own, listened
with patience, even when Louis proposed an alliance
with Lancaster.

Ere this Margaret was on the alert. When, in
the autumn of 1469, the exiled queen learned that
the house of York was divided against itself, and
that the king and the king-maker were mortal foes,
she left her retreat at Verdun, and, with her son,
repaired to the French king at Tours. Thither, to
renew their adhesion to the Red Rose, came, among
other Lancastrians, Jasper Tudor, Earl of Pembroke,
who had been wandering over Europe like a vagabond,
and Henry Holland, Duke of Exeter, and Edmund
Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, with his brother
John, who, since the rout of Hexham, had been lurking[Pg 236]
in Flanders, concealing their names and quality,
and suffering all those inconveniences that arise from
the ill-assorted union of pride and poverty. A man
bearing a nobler name, and gifted with a higher intellect
than Tudors, Hollands, or Beauforts, now
joined the Lancastrian exiles. It was John De
Vere, Earl of Oxford.

At the beginning of the contentions of York and
Lancaster, the De Veres naturally took part against
the misleaders of the monk-monarch, and as late, at
least, as 1455, John, twelfth Earl of Oxford, was a
friend of the duke. Oxford, however, was not prepared
for a transfer of the crown; and when the
dispute assumed the form of a dynastic war, he took
the losing side, and in 1461 was beheaded on Tower
Hill, with his eldest son, Aubrey. At the time of
the old earl's execution, his second son, John, was
twenty-three; and, being husband of Margaret Neville,
the sister of Warwick, he was allowed to remain
undisturbed in England, to bear the title of
Oxford, and, without taking any part in politics, to
maintain feudal state at Wyvenhoe and Castle Hedlingham.
Oxford, however, was "linked in the
closest friendship with Warwick;" and when the
Yorkist king shook off the influence of "The Stout
Earl," England was no longer a place of safety for
the chief of the De Veres. In 1470 Oxford followed
his great brother-in-law to France, hoping,[Pg 237]
perhaps, to mediate between Warwick and the Lancastrian
queen who had ever hated the earl as her
mightiest foe.

At this period Margaret of Anjou had seen forty
summers, and, doubtless, felt somewhat less strongly
than in earlier days the ambition which had animated
her before Wakefield and Hexham. But the
Prince of Wales was now in his eighteenth year, and,
inspired by maternal love, she was ready, in order to
regain the crown for him, to brave new dangers and
endure fresh hardships.

Young Edward was, indeed, a prince on whom a
mother might well look with pride. Every thing
had been done to make him worthy of the throne
he had been born to inherit. Fortescue had instructed
the royal boy in the duties necessary for
his enacting the part of "a patriot king;" and,
while engaged in studies so grave, the prince had
not neglected those accomplishments essential to his
rank. Ere leaving Verdun he had become a handsome
and interesting youth. His bearing was chivalrous;
his manner graceful; his countenance of
almost feminine beauty, shaded with fair hair, and
lighted up with a blue eye that sparkled with valor
and intelligence. Such, arrayed in the short purple
jacket trimmed with ermine, the badge of St. George
on his breast, and a single ostrich feather       his cognizance
as Prince of Wales       in his high cap, was[Pg 238]
the heir of Lancaster, whom Margaret of Anjou
presented to the devoted adherents of the Red Rose,
who, having lost every thing else, came to the French
court to place their swords at his disposal.

Louis was now in his element; and to reconcile
the Yorkist earl and the Lancastrian queen, he exerted
all his powers of political intrigue. His task,
indeed, was not easy. Warwick had accused Margaret
of plotting against his life, and murdering his
father. Margaret had charged Warwick       whom
she hated more bitterly even than she had hated the
Duke of York       with depriving her of a crown, and
destroying her reputation. The earl's wish, in the
event of deposing Edward, still was to place Clarence
on the throne; and, even since quarreling with the
Yorkist king, he had taken part against the Lancastrians.
The queen was, on her part, utterly averse
to friendship with her ancient adversary. "My
wounds," she exclaimed, "must bleed till doomsday,
when to God's justice I will appeal for vengeance!"

Most men would have regarded the case as desperate.
But Louis viewed it in another light. Between
the queen and the earl, indeed, there was a
wide gulph, in which ran the blood of slaughtered
friends and kinsmen; but one sentiment the queen
without a crown and the earl without an earldom
had in common       an intense antipathy to Edward[Pg 239]
of York. Moreover, the Prince of Wales had, on
some festive occasion, seen Anne Neville, the earl's
daughter, and the sight had inspired him with one
of those romantic attachments which call into action
the tenderest sympathies and the noblest aspirations.
A fear that Margaret and Warwick would never
consent to a union might have daunted young Edward,
but Louis had seen more of the world. He
knew that Warwick could hardly see the prince
without being covetous to have him as a son-in-law;
and he knew that Margaret would be prompted by
the ambition of a queen, and the tenderness of a
mother, to recover by compromise the crown which
she had been unable to gain by force. In one important
respect the mind of Louis was made up       that,
on all points, he would intrigue and negotiate
with an eye to his own profit.

Louis had correctly calculated the effect of circumstances
on those with whom he had to deal.
The earl, being flesh and blood, could not resist the
prospect of a throne for his daughter, and indicated
his readiness to make peace. Margaret was not
quite so reasonable; but, at length, she yielded so
far as to agree to a meeting with the man whom
she had accused of piercing her heart with wounds
that could never be healed.

Accordingly, a conference was appointed; and in
June, 1470, Warwick, in the Castle of Amboise, met[Pg 240]
the queen, from the brow of whose husband he had
torn the English crown, and the prince, the illegitimacy
of whose birth he had proclaimed at Paul's
Cross. Now, however, the earl was prepared to give
his hand in friendship to one, and his daughter as
wife to the other. He offered to restore Henry of
Windsor, if Margaret would consent to unite the
Prince of Wales to Anne Neville. Margaret, however,
felt the sharpness of the sacrifice, and, after
some hesitation, asked for time to consider the proposal.

Ere the time expired, the queen's aversion to the
match was strengthened. She showed Louis a letter
from England, in which the hand of Edward's
daughter, Elizabeth, then recognized as heiress to
the crown, was offered to her son. "Is not that,"
she asked, "a more profitable party? And if it be
necessary to forgive, is it not more queenly to treat
with Edward than with a twofold rebel?" Louis,
who was bent on business, did not relish such talk
as this. To Margaret he became so cool, that she
could hardly help seeing he would have thought
little of throwing her interests overboard. To Warwick
he was all kindness, declaring that he cared
far more for the earl than he did either for Margaret
or her son, and even giving an assurance that he
would aid Warwick to conquer England for any one
he chose.

[Pg 241]

Margaret perceived that it was no time for exhibitions
of vindictive feeling; and, with undisguised
reluctance, she consented to the match. After
thus sacrificing her long-cherished prejudices, the
exiled queen proceeded to Angers, on a visit to the
Countess of Warwick and to Anne Neville, at that
time in her sixteenth year. Preparations were then
made for the marriage which was to cement the new
alliance, and, in July, the daughter of "The Stout
Earl" was solemnly espoused to the son of "The
Foreign Woman."

About this time there arrived at Calais an English
lady of quality, who stated that she was on her
way to join the Duchess of Clarence. Vauclerc,
believing that she brought overtures of peace from
Edward to Warwick, and feeling a strong interest
in the reconciliation of the king and the earl, allowed
her to pass, and she found her way to Angers,
where the marriage was then being celebrated. The
errand of this lady was not quite so amiable as Vauclerc
had supposed. On arriving at Angers, she
revealed herself to Clarence as having been sent by
his brothers to tempt him to betray Warwick       to
implore him, at all events, not to aid in the subversion
of their father's house.

Clarence was just in the state of mind to be worked
upon by a skillful diplomatist; and the female
embassador executed her mission with a craft that[Pg 242]
Louis might have envied. The duke, so long as he
had simply been taking part in a feud between Warwick
and the Woodvilles, was all zeal for the earl,
and not without hope that he himself might profit
by the strife; but no sooner did the weak prince
find himself engaged with the adherents of the Red
Rose in a contest to substitute the heir of the house
of Lancaster for the chief of the house of York,
than he began to pause and ponder. At this stage
the lady of quality appeared at Angers, and managed
her part of the business with the requisite dexterity;
in fact, Clarence declared that he was not
so great an enemy to his brother as was supposed,
and he promised, significantly, to prove that such
was the case when he reached England. The lady
departed from Angers, and returned to Edward's
court with a full assurance that her mission would
produce important results.

The bridal of the prince and Anne Neville having
been celebrated, Warwick and Oxford prepared
to return to England. Fortune, with fickle smile,
cheered the king-maker's enterprise. Every thing
was promising; for the English people, since Warwick
had been exiled to a foreign strand, complained
that England without "The Stout Earl" was like a
world without a sun; and day after day came messengers
to tell that thousands of men were ready to
take up arms in his cause whenever he set foot on
his native soil.

[Pg 243]

Delay was not to be thought of under such circumstances.
The earl did not lose any time. With
Pembroke and Clarence, and Oxford and George De
Vere, Oxford's brother, he went on board the fleet
that lay at Harfleur. The French coast was not,
indeed, clear; for Burgundy had fitted out a fleet,
which blockaded Harfleur and the mouth of the
Seine. But even the elements favored Warwick at
this crisis of his career. A storm arising dispersed
the duke's fleet; and, next morning, the weather
being fine, the earl and the Lancastrians gave their
sails to the wind, and, confident of bringing their
enterprise to a successful issue, left behind them the
coast of Normandy.



[Pg 244]




CHAPTER XXV.

THE EARL'S RETURN AND EDWARD'S FLIGHT.


When Warwick, in France, was forming an alliance
with Margaret of Anjou, the people of England
were manifesting their anxiety for "The Stout
Earl's" return.[10] Edward of York, meanwhile, appeared
to consider the kingdom nothing the worse
for the king-maker's absence. He even ridiculed
the idea of taking any precautions to guard against
the invasion which was threatened. Instead of making
preparations for defense, the king, after the earl's
departure from England, occupied himself wholly[Pg 245]
with the ladies of his court; going in their company
on hunting excursions, and diverting himself
with every kind of pleasant pastime.

The Duke of Burgundy was by no means so cool
as the King of England. In fact, Charles the Rash
was quite aware of the degree of danger to which
his brother-in-law was exposed, and gave him timely
warning not only that an invasion was projected,
but of the very port at which Warwick intended to
land. "By God's blessed lady," exclaimed Edward,
"I wish the earl would land, and when we
have beaten him in England, I only ask our brother
of Burgundy to keep such a good look-out at sea as
to prevent his return to France."

The wish which the king, with too much confidence
in his resources, thus expressed, was speedily
to be gratified. About the middle of September,
1470, while he was in the north, suppressing an insurrection
headed by Lord Fitzhugh, Warwick suddenly
landed on the coast of Devon, and proclaimed
that he came to put down falsehood and oppression,
and to have law and justice fairly administered. It
soon appeared that the popularity of the earl gave
him a power that was irresistible. A few months
earlier, when he was escaping to France, a magnificent
reward had been offered by the king to any
man who should seize the rebellious baron; but
now that the earl was once more in England, with[Pg 246]
Oxford by his side, all the heroes of the Round Table,
if they had been in the flesh, would have shrunk
from the hazard of such an exploit. Long ere he
landed, the Nevilles and De Veres were mustering
their merry-men; a few days later warriors of all
ranks were flocking to his standard; and, at the
head of a numerous army, he marched toward London.
Being informed, however, that the capital
was favorable to his project, and that the king had
retraced his steps to Nottingham, Warwick turned
toward the Trent, summoning men to his standard
as he went, and intending to give Edward battle.

Meanwhile, the king's situation was gradually becoming
desperate. His soldiers, giving way to discontent,
began to desert; and, while he was in Lincoln,
near the River Welland, circumstances occurred
to prove the prudence of Burgundy's warnings, and
to remove Edward's illusions.

At the time when Warwick was flying from England,
Edward, in defiance of prudential considerations,
took one of those steps which sometimes cost
a crown. After his victory at Hexham, Lord Montagu
had been gifted with the earldom of Northumberland.
At that time the young chief of the Percies
was a Lancastrian captive in the Tower or an
exile in Scotland; but the mediation of friends prevailed,
and the heir of Hotspur was reconciled to
the heir of the Mortimers. Edward deemed the[Pg 247]
opportunity favorable for weakening the Nevilles,
and encouraged the Northumbrians to petition for
the restoration of the house of Percy. The Northumbrians
did petition; Montagu resigned the earldom;
and the king, to console him for his loss, elevated
the victor of Hexham to the rank of marquis.
Montagu took the marquisate, but he indulged in a
bitter jest and bided his time.

It happened that, when Warwick landed, Montagu
had mustered ten thousand men in the king's name.
Hearing of the earl's return, these soldiers caught
the popular contagion, and evinced so strong an inclination
to desert their standard, that Montagu
saw that the hour for retaliation was come; and,
after remarking that "Edward had taken Northumberland
from him, and given him a marquisate,
but only a pie's nest to maintain it withal," he
frankly added, "I shall decidedly take the part of
the earl."

The king was that night asleep in the royal tent
when aroused by the chief of his minstrels, and informed
that Montagu and some other lords had
mounted their horses and ordered their soldiers to
raise the shout of "God bless King Henry!" Edward,
completely taken by surprise, rose and buckled
on his armor; but, resistance being out of the question,
he determined to fly. Having exhorted his
followers to go and join Warwick, pretending great[Pg 248]
friendship, but secretly retaining their allegiance,
the king rode toward Lynn, accompanied by about
a hundred knights and gentlemen, among whom
were his brother, Richard, Duke of Gloucester; his
brother-in-law, Anthony Woodville, Earl Rivers;
his Chamberlain, William, Lord Hastings; and William
Fiennes, Lord Say, son of that nobleman who
had been put to death during Jack Cade's insurrection.
At Lynn the king found an English ship and
two Dutch vessels ready to put to sea. On board
of these Edward and his friends hastily embarked;
and, leaving Warwick and Oxford masters of England,
set sail for the territories of Burgundy.

Within St. Paul's Church-yard, to the north of the
Cathedral, Cardinal Kempe had erected a cross to
remind passers-by to pray for the souls of those
buried beneath their feet. To preach at Paul's
Cross was an object of clerical ambition; and, when
service was there performed, the multitude gathered
round the pulpit, while the wealthy citizens and
municipal functionaries occupied galleries so constructed
as to shelter them when the weather happened
to be inclement. On the Sunday after Michaelmas,
1470, Dr. Goddard was the divine who
officiated; and the doctor, being one of Warwick's
chaplains, preached a political sermon, advocating
the claims of the royal captive in the Tower, and
setting forth the earl's patriotic intentions in such a[Pg 249]
light that the audience could not help wishing well
to the enterprise.

The metropolis, thus excited, conceived a strong
desire for Warwick's success; and, when it became
known that King Edward had fled from the Welland,
and that the earl was marching upon London,
the partisans of the house of York, seeing that resistance
would be vain, hastened to take refuge in
the religious houses that had the privilege of affording
sanctuary.

Hard by the Palace of Westminster, in the fifteenth
century, stood a massive edifice, with a church
built over it in the form of a cross. This structure,
which was a little town in itself, and strongly enough
fortified to stand a siege, had been erected by Edward
the Confessor as a place of refuge to the distressed,
and, according to tradition and the belief of
the superstitious, it had been "by St. Peter in his
own person, accompanied with great numbers of
angels, by night specially hallowed and dedicated to
God."

Within the walls of this sanctuary, at the time
when Edward of York was flying to the territories
of the Duke of Burgundy, and Warwick was advancing
upon London, Elizabeth Woodville, leaving
the Tower, and escaping down the Thames in a
barge, took refuge with her three daughters, her
mother, the Duchess of Bedford, and her friend, the[Pg 250]
Lady Scroope. There, forsaken by her court, and
exposed to penury, the unhappy woman gave birth
to her son Edward. This boy, "the child of misery,"
was "baptized in tears." "Like a poor man's
child was he christened," says the chronicler, "his
godfather being the Abbot and Prior of Westminster."

Meanwhile, on the 6th of October, Warwick entered
London in triumph; and, going directly to the
Tower, the great earl released Henry of Windsor,
proclaimed him king, and escorted him from a prison
to a palace. After this the king-maker called a
Parliament, which branded Edward as a usurper,
attainted his adherents as traitors, restored to the
Lancastrians their titles and estates, and passed an
act entailing the crown on Edward of Lancaster,
and, failing that hopeful prince, on George, Duke
of Clarence.

So great was the earl's power and popularity that
he accomplished the restoration of Lancaster almost
without drawing his sword; and no man suffered
death upon the scaffold, with the exception of John
Tiptoft, Earl of Worcester, whose cruelties, exercised
in spite of learning and a love of letters that have
made his name famous, had exasperated the people
to phrensy, and won him the name of "the Butcher."
Warwick was not a man, save when on fields of
fight, to delight in the shedding of blood; and, even[Pg 251]
had it been otherwise, his high pride would have
made him scorn in the hour of triumph the idea of
striking helpless foes.

At Calais the news of the earl's triumph created
no less excitement than in England. The intelligence
might, under some circumstances, have caused
Governor Vauclerc considerable dismay and no slight
apprehension that his conduct while the earl was
in adversity would place him in a perilous predicament.
Vauclerc, however, had his consolation, and
must have chuckled as he reflected on the prudence
he had exercised. The crafty Gascon, doubtless,
congratulated himself heartily on his foresight, and
felt assured that in spite of Edward's patent and
Burgundy's pension, the devotion he had expressed
and the intelligence he had given to Warwick would,
now that the political wind had changed, secure him
a continuance of place and power.

But, whatever on the occasion might have been
Governor Vauclerc's sentiments, Warwick's triumph
produced a sudden change in the politics of Calais.
The city, so often the refuge of Yorkists in distress,
manifested unequivocal symptoms of joy at a revolution
which restored the house of Lancaster; and
the Calesians, forgetting that, from selfish motives,
they had, six months earlier, refused Warwick admittance
within their walls, painted the white cross
of Neville over their doors, and endeavored, in various[Pg 252]
ways, to testify excessive respect for the great
noble who could make and unmake kings. As for
the garrison, which, a few months earlier, could not
be trusted, every man was now ready to drink the
earl's health; every tongue sounded the praises of
the king-maker; every cap was conspicuously ornamented
with the Ragged Staff, known, far and wide,
as the badge of the Countess of Warwick.

Fortune, which seldom does things by halves,
seemed to have conducted the earl to a triumph too
complete to be reversed; and if any one, with the gift
of political prophecy, had ventured to predict that,
within six months, King Edward would ride into
London amid the applause of the populace, he would
have been regarded as a madman. Every circumstance
rendered such an event improbable in the extreme.
The fickle goddess appeared to have forever
deserted the White Rose, and to have destined the
sun of York never more to shine in merry England.



[Pg 253]




CHAPTER XXVI.

THE EARL OF WORCESTER.


While Edward is in exile; and Elizabeth Woodville
in the sanctuary; and Warwick holding the
reins of power; and Margaret of Anjou and her son
on the Continent; we may refer with brevity to the
melancholy fate of John Tiptoft, Earl of Worcester,
celebrated on the same page of history as "the
Butcher" and as "the paragon of learning and the
patron of Caxton"       the most accomplished among
the nobility of his age, and, at the same time, the
only man "who, during the Yorkist domination,
had committed such excesses as to merit the punishment
of death at the Lancastrian restoration."

Though not of high patrician rank like the Nevilles
or the De Veres, Worcester had claims to considerable
respect in an ancestral point of view. One
of the family of Tiptoft, after fighting in the Barons'
Wars against Simon de Montfort, accompanied the
victor of Evesham when that great prince fared
forth to the Holy Land to signalize his prowess
against the enemies of his religion; and the descendants
of the crusader made their name known
to fame in those wars which our Plantagenet kings[Pg 254]
carried on in Scotland and in France. Early in
the fifteenth century, Lord Tiptoft, the chief of the
race, espoused the sister and co-heir of Edward
Charlton, Lord Powis; and, about the year 1427,
their son, John Tiptoft, first saw the light at Everton,
in the shire of Cambridge.

The heir of the Tiptofts was educated at Baliol
College, Oxford; and at that ancient seat of learning
pursued his studies with such energy and enthusiasm
as raised the admiration of his contemporaries,
and laid the foundation of the fame which
he has enjoyed with posterity. When in his teens,
he became, by his father's death, one of the barons
of England, and, some time later, in 1449, he found
himself elevated, by Henry of Windsor, to the earldom
of Worcester. He had enjoyed this new dignity
for six years, and reached the age of twenty-eight,
when blood was first shed at St. Albans in
the Wars of the Roses.

Worcester was a man of action as well as a
scholar. When, therefore, war commenced, he was,
doubtless, looked upon by both parties as a desirable
partisan. The accomplished earl, however, appears
to have been in no haste to risk his head and his
baronies in the quarrel either of York or Lancaster.
At first, he hesitated, wavered, and refrained from
committing himself as to the merits of the controversy,
and, finally, instead of plucking either "the[Pg 255]
pale or the purple rose," avoided the hazard of
making a choice by leaving the country and repairing
to the Holy Land.

After indulging his zeal as a Christian and his
curiosity as a man, during his visit to Jerusalem,
Worcester turned toward Italy; and having beheld
the wonders of Venice       then in all the pride of
wealth and commercial prosperity       and resided for
a time at Padua       then famous as the chief seat of
European learning       he proceeded to Rome to gladden
his eyes with a sight of the Vatican Library.
While in Rome Worcester had an interview with
Pius the Second, and an interesting scene rendered
the occasion memorable. On being presented to the
Pope, better known in England as Æneas Sylvius,
the young English nobleman addressed to him a
Latin oration, to which the learned pontiff listened
with tears of admiration.

As soon as the news spread over Europe that the
Lancastrians had been utterly routed on Towton
Field, and that Edward of York was firmly seated
on the English throne, Worcester returned home.
During his residence in Italy he had purchased
many volumes of manuscripts; and of these he contributed
a liberal share to the library at Oxford,
whose shelves had formerly profited by the donations
of "The Good Duke Humphrey." When
abroad, Worcester had evinced such an eagerness[Pg 256]
to possess himself of books, that it was said he
plundered the libraries of Italy to enrich those of
England.

The king received Worcester with favor, and treated
him with high consideration. Soon after his return
the learned earl presided at the trial of John,
Earl of Oxford, and his son, Aubrey De Vere; and,
no longer inclined to waver, he buckled on the mail
of a warrior, and accompanied Edward to the north
of England on his expedition against the Lancastrians.
Meanwhile, he had been intrusted with high
offices; and appears to have at the same time exercised
the functions of Treasurer of the King's Exchequer
and Constable of the Tower of London,
Chancellor of Ireland, and Justice of North Wales.

For seven years after his return from Italy, Worcester
conducted himself with credit and distinction.
Evil communications, however, corrupt good
manners. At a critical period the intellectual baron
appears to have fallen under the influence of Elizabeth
Woodville; and to have been used by that unscrupulous
woman to perpetrate acts of tyranny that
ultimately cost him his life.

Of the great Norman barons whose swords had
won them dominion over the Celts of Ireland the
Fitzgeralds were among the proudest and most powerful.
One branch of the family held the earldom
of Desmond; another that of Kildare; and both exercised[Pg 257]
much influence in the provinces subject to
their sway. In the contest between the rival Plantagenets,
the Fitzgeralds adopted the White Rose as
their badge; and Thomas, eighth Earl of Desmond,
fought by Edward's side in those battles which won
the crown for the house of York.

When the question of Edward's marriage with
Elizabeth Woodville was agitated, Desmond was
naturally consulted; and the Norman earl took a
different course from such pickthanks as Sir John
Howard. Being frank and honest, he unhesitatingly
pointed out the king's imprudence, and perhaps
became, in consequence, one of those people for whom
the widow of Sir John Grey did not entertain any
particular affection. But, however that may have
been, Edward appointed his old comrade-in-arms
deputy to the Duke of Clarence, who was then Lord-lieutenant
of Ireland, and when Desmond was preparing
to depart from London, the king asked if
there was any thing in his policy that could be
amended. The earl, with more zeal for his sovereign's
service than respect for his sovereign's marriage
vow, advised Edward to divorce Elizabeth
Woodville, and to marry some woman worthy of
sharing the English throne.

Edward was not the most faithful of husbands;
and Elizabeth Woodville may not, at first, have been
the most patient of wives, though she afterward[Pg 258]
learned to submit with a good grace. At all events,
they had sundry domestic quarrels; and Edward,
during some altercation with the queen, said, "Had
I hearkened to Desmond's advice, your insolent spirit
would have been humbled."

The queen's curiosity was excited in the highest
degree; and, unluckily for Desmond, she determined
to find out what advice he had given. On
eliciting the truth, Elizabeth vowed revenge; and
so strenuous were her efforts to effect the earl's
ruin, that she succeeded at length in having him
sentenced to lose both his office and his head. Unfortunately
for Worcester, he was appointed to succeed
Desmond as deputy; and, on arriving in Ireland
to assume his functions, he caused the sentence
of decapitation against his predecessor to be executed.
Under any circumstances, the duty which
the new deputy had thus to perform would have
been invidious. If we are to credit the story generally
told, Worcester executed the sentence under
circumstances, not only invidious, but disgraceful and
dishonorable.

According to the popular account of the execution
of Desmond, the king had no more idea than
the child unborn that his old friend was to fall a
victim to female malice. It is said that Elizabeth
Woodville, having by stealth obtained the royal signet,
affixed the seal to a warrant for the Irish earl's[Pg 259]
execution, and that Worcester, in order to possess
himself of some part of Desmond's estates, instantly
acted on this document. It is added that, on hearing
of the transaction, Edward was so enraged, that
Elizabeth, terrified at her husband's wrath, fled from
him to a place of safety.

Desmond was executed at Drogheda; and, when
his head fell, the Fitzgeralds rose as one man to
avenge the death of their chief. Worcester, however,
far from being daunted, stood his ground fearlessly,
and remained in Ireland till 1470, when Warwick
finally broke with the king. As Clarence
took part with his father-in-law, his posts as Constable
of England and Lord-lieutenant of Ireland
were forfeited, and Edward bestowed them upon
Worcester.

On the occasion of his promotion to the lord-lieutenancy,
Worcester returned to England. On
arriving at Southampton, he was commanded by
the king to sit in judgment on several gentlemen
and yeomen taken by Anthony Woodville in some
ships during a skirmish at sea. Worcester, who appears
to have been the reverse of squeamish about
shedding blood, condemned twenty of them to be
"drawn, hanged, and quartered." Among these
was John Clapham, the squire who figured so conspicuously
at Banbury.

Worcester had hardly rendered this service to[Pg 260]
Edward when Warwick landed, and carried every
thing before him. The revolution which restored
Henry of Windsor, and placed England in
the power of Warwick and his brother-in-law, the
Earl of Oxford, was accomplished with so little resistance,
that scarcely a drop of blood was shed.
Worcester, however, was not allowed to escape.
Though a man of rare accomplishments for his age,
and one who endeavored to inspire his countrymen
with that respect for letters which he himself felt,
the earl had, while constable of the Tower, been
guilty of fearful severities against the Lancastrians;
and he was spoken of among the populace as "The
Butcher of England."[11]

Hearing of the king's flight, and not unconscious
of his own unpopularity, Worcester was under the
necessity of shifting for himself as he best could.
His efforts to escape, however, were fruitless. Being
pursued into the county of Huntingdon, he was[Pg 261]
found concealed in a tree in the forest of Weybridge,
dragged from his hiding-place, and carried to the
Tower of London.

Worcester was, without delay, brought to trial.
The Earl of Oxford presided on the occasion; and
the lord-lieutenant was charged with having, while
deputy, been guilty of extreme cruelty to two orphan
boys, the infant sons of the Earl of Desmond. On
this charge he was condemned. He was forthwith
executed on Tower Hill, and his headless trunk was
buried in the monastery of the Black Friars.

Whatever the faults of Worcester, Caxton seems
to have regarded him with respect and admiration.
"Oh, good blessed Lord," exclaims that English
worthy, "what great loss was it of that noble, virtuous,
and well-disposed lord, the Earl of Worcester.
What worship had he at Rome, in the presence of
our holy father the pope, and in all other places
unto his death. The axe then did, at one blow,
cut off more learning than was in the heads of all
the surviving nobility."

CHAPTER XXVII.

THE BANISHED KING.


The adventures of Edward of York, when, at the
age of thirty, driven from the kingdom by the Earl
of Warwick, seem rather like the creation of a novelist's
fancy than events in real life. Scarcely had
he escaped from his mutinous army on the Welland,
taken shipping at Lynn, and sailed for the Burgundian
territories, trusting to the hospitality of his
brother-in-law, than he was beset with a danger
hardly less pressing than that from which he had
fled. Freed from that peril, and disappointed of a
cordial welcome, an impulse, which he had neither
the will nor the power to resist, brought back the
dethroned and banished prince, with a handful of
adherents, resolved either to be crowned with laurel
or covered with cypress.

During the Wars of the Roses, the narrow seas
were infested by the Easterlings, who sailed as privateers
as well as traders, and did a little business
in the way of piracy besides. At the time of Edward's
exile, the Easterlings were at war both with
the house of Valois and that of Plantagenet, and
had recently inflicted much damage on ships belonging[Pg 263]
to the subjects of England. Unluckily for
Edward, some of the Easterlings happened to be
hovering on the coast when he sailed from Lynn,
and scarcely had the shores of England vanished
from the eyes of the royal fugitive, when eight of
their ships gave chase to his little squadron.

The Yorkist king was far from relishing the eagerness
manifested by the Easterlings to make his
acquaintance, and would, doubtless, have been delighted
to get, by fair sailing, clearly out of their
way. This, however, appeared impossible; and,
as the danger became alarming, he commanded the
skipper to run ashore at all hazards. Edward, albeit
exile and fugitive, was not the man to be disobeyed;
and the ships stranded on the coast of
Friesland, near the town of Alkmaar. The Easterlings,
however, were not thus to be shaken off.
Instead of giving up the chase, they resolved to
board Edward's vessels by the next tide, and, meanwhile,
followed as close as the depth of the water
would permit. The king's situation was therefore
the reverse of pleasant. Indeed, his safety appeared
to depend on the chances of a few hours.

Among the European magnates with whom Edward,
in the course of his checkered career, had
formed friendships, was a Burgundian nobleman,
Louis de Bruges, Lord of Grauthuse. This personage,
at once a soldier, a scholar, and a trader,[Pg 264]
had, on more than one occasion, rendered acceptable
service to the White Rose. In other days, he
had been sent by the Duke of Burgundy to cancel
the treaty of marriage between the son of Margaret
of Anjou and the daughter of Mary of Gueldres:
and subsequently to the court of England, to treat
of the match between Margaret Plantagenet and the
Count of Charolois. Being stadtholder of Friesland,
the Burgundian happened to be at Alkmaar when
Edward was stranded on the coast, and by chance
became acquainted with the startling fact that England's
king was in the utmost danger of falling into
the hands of privateers from the Hanse Towns.

Louis de Bruges could hardly have been unaware
that the Duke of Burgundy had no wish to see Edward's
face, or to be inextricably involved in the
affairs of his unfortunate kinsman. The Lord of
Grauthuse, however, was not the person to leave,
on the coast of Friesland, at the mercy of pirates, a
friend whom, on the banks of the Thames, he had
known as a gallant and hospitable monarch; at
whose board he had feasted in the Great Hall of
Eltham, at whose balls he had danced in the Palace
of Westminster, and with whose hounds he had
hunted the stag through the glades of Windsor.
Perhaps, indeed, being gifted with true nobility of
soul, he was all the readier with his friendly offices
that Edward was a banished man. In any case, he[Pg 265]
took immediate steps to relieve the royal exile, hastened
on board, and, without reference to the duke's
political views, invited the English king and his
friends to land.

Never was assistance more cheerfully given, or
more gratefully received. The exiles breathed freely,
and thanked Heaven for aid so timely. But a
new difficulty at once presented itself. Edward was
so poor that he could not pay the master of the
Dutch vessel, and all his comrades were in an equally
unhappy plight. The king, however, soon got
over this awkward circumstance. Taking off his
cloak, which was lined with marten, he presented it
to the skipper, and, with that frank grace which he
possessed in such rare perfection, promised a fitting
reward when better days should come.

At the town of Alkmaar, twenty miles from
Amsterdam, and celebrated for its rich pastures, the
exiled king set foot on Continental soil. His circumstances
were most discouraging. Even his garments
and those of his friends appear to have been
in such a condition as to excite surprise. "Sure,"
says Comines, "so poor a company were never seen
before; yet the Lord of Grauthuse dealt very honorably
by them, giving them clothes, and bearing all
their expenses, till they came to the Hague."

In his adversity, indeed, the conqueror of Towton
could hardly have met with a better friend than[Pg 266]
Louis de Bruges. At the Hague the king felt the
hardness of his lot alleviated by such attentions as
exiles seldom experience. These, doubtless, were
not without their effect. As Edward indulged in
the good cheer of the city, and quaffed the good
wine of the country, he would gradually take heart.
Diverted from melancholy reflections by the wit of
Anthony Woodville, and the humor of William
Hastings, and the crafty suggestions of the boy-Duke
of Gloucester, he would find his heart animated
by a hope unfelt for days; and, under the
influence of successive bumpers, he would allude to
Warwick's implacable resentment, not in accents
of despondency, but with his habitual oath, and his
customary expression, "By God's Blessed Lady, he
shall repent it through every vein of his heart."

But what would Burgundy say to all this? That
was a question which the Lord of Grauthuse must
frequently have asked himself, after feasting his
royal guest, and recalling to his memory the scenes
of other days, and the fair and the noble who were
now suffering for his sake. The duke had already
heard of Henry's restoration in connection with a
rumor of Edward's death; and, far from manifesting
any excessive grief, he had remarked that his
relations were with the kingdom of England, not
with the king, and that he cared not whether the
name of Henry or that of Edward was employed in[Pg 267]
the articles of treaty. In fact, the Lancastrian
prejudices of Charles the Rash had never, perhaps,
been stronger than when the mighty arm of Warwick
was likely to smite the enemies of the Red
Rose.

From the Hague Louis de Bruges intimated to
Burgundy the arrival of King Edward. Burgundy
had within the year demonstrated his respect for
the King of England by appearing at Ghent with
the blue garter on his leg and the red cross on his
mantle. But, now that Edward was a king without
a crown, the duke's sentiments were quite
changed, and he was unwilling, by holding any intercourse
with so hapless a being, to throw new difficulties
in the way of those ambitious projects which
he hoped would convert his ducal coronal into a
regal and independent crown. On hearing the news
of his brother-in-law being alive and in Holland,
the duke's features, naturally harsh and severe, assumed
an expression of extreme surprise. "He
would have been better pleased," says Comines, "if
it had been news of Edward's death."

Burgundy was with some reason annoyed at Edward's
having paid so little attention to his warnings;
and, moreover, he was vexed with himself for
having, out of friendship to so imprudent a prince,
exasperated to mortal enmity so potent a personage
as "The Stout Earl." But Burgundy little knew[Pg 268]
the ability and energy which, in seasons of adversity,
the chief of the Plantagenets was capable of
displaying. Edward already felt that something
must be attempted. Dullness he could not bear.
The idea of passing his life as a grumbling or plotting
refugee was not to be entertained. Hitherto,
when not engaged in making war on men, he had
been occupied in making love to women. For luxurious
indolence he had always had a failing; from
violent exertion he had seldom shrunk; but excitement
he had ever regarded as indispensable. When
he left his gay and brilliant court, it was to charge,
at the head of fighting men, against the foes of his
house; and, with all his faults, it was admitted that
Christendom could hardly boast of so brave a soldier,
so gallant a knight, or so skillful a general.
One man, indeed, Edward knew was still deemed
his superior; and the banished Plantagenet burned
for an opportunity to exercise his somewhat savage
valor against the patriot earl who had made and
unmade him.

The duke soon found that his royal relative was
not likely to die an exiled king. In fact, Edward,
who lately had exhibited so much indolence and indifference,
was now all enthusiasm and eagerness for
action. He who, while in England, was so lazy that
the most pressing exhortations could not rouse him
to obviously necessary precautions in defense of his[Pg 269]
crown, had now, when an exile in Holland, more
need of a bridle than a spur.

The position of Duke Charles was somewhat delicate.
While aware that he could not with decency
refuse aid to his wife's brother, he was unable to
exclude from his mind great apprehensions from
the hostility of Warwick. In this dilemma, even
Europe's proudest and haughtiest magnate could
not afford to be fastidious as to the means of saving
himself. Between love of the duchess and fear of
the earl, Charles the Rash for once found it necessary
to condescend to the process of playing a double
game. To ingratiate himself with Warwick he resolved
to issue a proclamation forbidding any of his
subjects to join Edward's expedition; and, at the
same time, to pacify the duchess, he promised to
grant secretly to his exiled kinsman the means of
attempting to regain the English crown.

Preparations for Edward's departure were soon
made. Twelve hundred men were got together,
part of whom were English, armed with hand-guns,
and part Flemings. To convey these to England,
ships were necessary: to pay them, money was not
less essential. Both ships and money were forthcoming.

Burgundy furnished the ships. The duke, however,
acted with a caution which seemed to form no
part of his character, and gave assistance in a manner[Pg 270]
so secret that he trusted to avoid hostilities with
the government established. At Vere, in Walcheren,
four vessels were fitted out for Edward's use
in the name of private merchants, and fourteen
others were hired from the Easterlings to complete
the squadron.

The house of Medici would seem to have supplied
the money. At an earlier stage of the great struggle
that divided England, Cosmo, the grandfather
of Lorenzo the Magnificent, had thrown his weight
into the Yorkist scale by advancing money to keep
Edward on the throne; and the banker-princes of
Florence appear once more to have influenced the
fortunes of the house of Plantagenet by affording
pecuniary aid to the heir of York. One way or
another, Edward got possession of fifty thousand
florins       no insignificant sum, considering how desperate
seemed his fortunes.

The royal exile was now impatient to be in England,
and there was at least one man who prayed
earnestly for the success of his enterprise. This was
Louis de Bruges, who       to his credit be it told       had
throughout displayed toward the fugitive monarch,
in an age of selfishness and servility, a generosity
worthy of those great days of chivalry which boasted
of the Black Prince and John de Valois. After
having given all the aid he could to Edward in regard
to ships and money, Louis still appears to have[Pg 271]
thought he had not done enough. To complete his
courtesy, therefore, he offered to accompany the banished
king to England, and aid in overcoming his
enemies in the battles that were inevitable. This
last sacrifice to friendship Edward declined to accept;
but he was touched by such a proof of esteem,
and pressed his host strongly to come once more to
England, and give him an opportunity of requiting
so much hospitality. After an affectionate farewell,
the king and the stadtholder parted; and Edward,
having embarked, sailed toward England, with
the determination either to reoccupy a regal throne
or to fill a warrior's grave.

Edward's fleet sailed from Vere, in Walcheren,
and, after a prosperous voyage, approached Cromer,
on the coast of Norfolk. Hoping much from the
influence of the Mowbrays, and eager to set his foot
on English soil, the king sent Sir Robert Chamberlaine
and another knight ashore to ascertain the
ideas of the Duke of Norfolk. But little did Edward
know of the position of his friends. The
province was entirely under the influence of Oxford;
and the Mowbrays, so far from retaining any
power, appear to have been glad, indeed, of that
earl's protection. "The duke and duchess," says
John Paston, writing to his mother, "now sue to
him as humbly as ever I did to them, inasmuch
that my Lord of Oxford shall have the rule of them[Pg 272]
and theirs, by their own desire and great means."
The answer brought back by Edward's knights was
not, therefore, satisfactory. Indeed, Oxford had
just been in Norfolk, to assure himself that no
precautions were omitted; and the coast was so
vigilantly guarded by his brother, George De Vere,
that an attempt to land would have been rushing on
certain destruction.

Disappointed, but not dismayed, the king ordered
the mariners to steer northward; and a violent storm
scattered his fleet. Persevering, however, with his
single ship, Edward, after having been tossed by
winds and storms for forty-eight hours, sailed into
the Humber, and on the 14th of March, 1471, effected
a landing at Ravenspur, where, in other days,
Henry of Bolingbroke had set foot when he came to
deprive the second Richard of his crown and his life.
Having passed the night at the village hard by, the
king was next morning joined by his friends, who
had landed on another part of the coast.

Edward now set his face southward; but he soon
found that, on the shores of England, he was almost
as far from his object as he had been on the coast
of Walcheren. The people of the north were decidedly
hostile; and at York he was brought to a
stand-still. It was an age, however, when men
sported with oaths as children do with playthings;
and Edward's conscience was by no means more[Pg 273]
tender than those of his neighbors. To smooth his
way, he solemnly swore only to claim the dukedom
of York, not to make any attempt to recover the
crown; and, moreover, he carried his dissimulation
so far as to proclaim King Henry and assume the
ostrich feather, which was the cognizance of the
Lancastrian Prince of Wales.

After leaving York, however, a formidable obstacle
presented itself in the shape of Pontefract
Castle, where Montagu lay with an army. But the
marquis, deceived, it would seem, by a letter from
the false Clarence, made no attempt to bar Edward's
progress; and, once across the Trent, the king threw
off his disguise, and rallied the people of the south
to his standard. At Coventry, into which Warwick
had retired to await the arrival of Clarence
with twelve thousand men, Edward, halting before
the walls, challenged the earl to decide their quarrel
by single combat. The king-maker, however,
treated this piece of knightly bravado with contempt;
and Edward, having in vain endeavored to
bring his great foe to battle by threatening the town
of Warwick, was fain to throw himself between the
earl and the capital.

All this time Warwick's danger was much greater
than he supposed, for the negotiations of the female
embassador sent to Angers were bearing fruit;
and Gloucester had held a secret conference with[Pg 274]
Clarence in the false duke's camp. The consequences
of this interview soon appeared. Clarence,
reconciled to his brothers, seized an early opportunity
of making his soldiers put the White Rose on
their gorgets instead of the Red, and then, with
colors flying and trumpets sounding, marched to
Edward's camp.

The king, thus re-enforced, pressed courageously
toward London. Perhaps he entertained little doubt
of a favorable reception; for he knew full well that
the interest he had among the city dames, and the
immense sums he owed their husbands       sums never
likely to pay unless in the event of a restoration       made
London friendly to his cause; and he knew,
moreover, that thousands of his partisans were in
the sanctuaries, ready to come forth and don the
White Rose whenever the banner of York waved in
the spring breeze before the city gates.

It appears that Warwick, ere leaving London,
had placed the capital and the king under the auspices
of his brother, George Neville, Archbishop of
York. On hearing of Edward's approach, the archbishop
made an effort to discharge his duty, mounted
Henry of Windsor on horseback, and caused him
to ride from St. Paul's to Walbrook to enlist the
sympathies of the citizens. But during the last six
months the feelings of the populace had undergone
a considerable change, and the spectacle of the monk-monarch[Pg 275]
on his palfrey failed to elicit any thing like
enthusiasm. Seeing how the political wind blew,
the ambitious prelate resolved to abandon his brother's
cause, and dispatched a message to Edward asking
to be received into favor.

The archbishop was assured of a pardon; and the
way having thus been cleared, the king, on Thursday,
the 11th of April, entered the city. After riding
to St. Paul's, he repaired to the bishop's palace,
and thither, to his presence, came the archbishop,
leading Henry by the hand. Having taken possession
of his captive, Edward rode to Westminster,
rendered thanks to God in the Abbey for his restoration,
conducted his wife and infant son from the
sanctuary to Baynard's Castle, passed next day,
Good Friday, in that palace of Duke Humphrey,
and then braced on his armor to battle for his
crown.



[Pg 276]




CHAPTER XXVIII.

QUEEN MARGARET'S VOYAGE.


One day in the middle of November, 1470, about
three months after the marriage of Edward of Lancaster
and Anne Neville, Margaret of Anjou visited
Paris, and was received in the capital of Louis the
Crafty with honors never before accorded but to
queens of France. The daughter of King René
must in that hour have formed high notions of the
advantage of Warwick's friendship, for it was entirely
owing to the king-maker's triumph that King
Henry's wife was treated with so much distinction.

The news of Warwick's success and of Edward's
discomfiture, which had caused so much excitement
in Calais, the Continental strong-hold of the English,
traveled rapidly to the French territories, and
reached the king, who, at Amboise, was anxiously
awaiting the result of Warwick's expedition. Louis
was overjoyed at the success of his schemes, and
demonstrated his confidence in the genius of the
earl by setting the treaty of Peronne at defiance,
and breaking all terms of amity with the Duke of
Burgundy. In his enthusiasm he could not even
recognize the possibility of a change of fortune.[Pg 277]
For once this apostle of deceit was deceived by himself.

While rejoicing in the results produced by his
political craft, Louis was seized with a fit of devotion.
To indulge his superstitious emotions, the
king went on a pilgrimage to the Church of St.
Mary at Celles, in Poitou; and, having there expressed
his own gratitude to Heaven, he issued orders
that the clergy, nobles, and inhabitants of Paris
and other towns throughout France should make
solemn procession in honor of God and the Virgin,
and give thanks at once for the victory obtained by
Henry of Windsor over the Earl of March, who had
long usurped his throne, and for the peace now happily
established between England and France.

The visit of Margaret of Anjou to Paris was then
projected; and, when the religious festival, which
lasted for three days, was over, preparations were
made for her reception. At the appointed time,
Margaret proceeded on the journey, accompanied by
the Prince and Princess of Wales, the Countess of
Warwick, the Countess of Wiltshire, a daughter of
the house of Beaufort, and other ladies and damsels
who had formed the court at Verdun, and attended
by an escort of French noblemen, among whom the
Counts D'Eu, Dunois, and Vendôme were prominent
figures.

On reaching the French capital, Margaret was[Pg 278]
received with the highest honors. "When she approached
Paris," says Monstrelet, "the bishop, the
court of Parliament, the University, the provosts of
Paris, and the court of Châtelet, by express orders
from the king, together with the principal inhabitants,
came out to meet her, handsomely dressed, and
in very numerous bodies. She made her entry at
the gate of St. James; and all the streets through
which she passed, from that gate to the palace,
where apartments had been handsomely prepared
for her, were adorned with hangings of tapestry,
and had tents pitched in all the squares." At such
a time Margaret could hardly have helped recalling
to memory, perhaps not without feelings of bitterness,
how different had been her reception when,
eight years earlier, she, poor indeed and desolate,
but then as much as now Queen of the Lancastrians,
came with her son in her hand to implore
her kinsman's aid to recover her husband's crown.

Enthusiastic as was the welcome of the Lancastrians
to Paris, they had no motive to prolong their
stay on the banks of the Seine. Indeed, as it was
believed that nothing but the presence of the queen
and Prince of Wales was wanting to secure Warwick
triumph, they were all anxiety to set sail.
In November they journeyed to the coast, but the
winter was so cold and the weather so stormy that
they were fain to postpone their voyage.

[Pg 279]

About the opening of the year 1471, the Prior
of St. John, dispatched by Warwick, came to urge
the necessity of Margaret's presence, and that of the
Prince of Wales, in England. The queen again
embarked, and the earl gladly prepared to welcome
the mother and the son to those shores from which
he had, seven years before, driven them poor and
destitute; but still the winds were adverse and the
weather stormy, and the ships only left Harfleur to
be driven back damaged.[12]

The elements had often proved unfavorable to
Margaret of Anjou, but never under circumstances
so unfortunate as on this occasion. Thrice did she
put to sea, and as often was she dashed back by
contrary winds. The partisans of each of the Roses
in England put their own interpretation on these
unpropitious gales. "It is God's just provision,"
said the Yorkists, "that the foreign woman, who
has been the cause of so many battles and so much
slaughter, should never return to England to do[Pg 280]
more mischief." "The queen," said the Lancastrians,
"is kept away, and her journey prevented,
by Friar Bungey, the Duchess of Bedford, and other
sorcerers and necromancers."

All winter the queen and prince were compelled
to wait patiently for fair winds to waft them to the
shores of England; and while in this position they
learned, with some degree of alarm, that Edward of
York had landed at Ravenspur, and that Clarence,
breaking faith with Warwick, had been reconciled
to his brother. But, however anxious at this intelligence,
they were not seriously apprehensive of
the consequences. Margaret knew, to her cost, the
influence which Warwick exercised in England, and,
sanguine by nature, she could hardly doubt that he
would prove victorious in the event of a struggle.
The prince, though intelligent and accomplished,
was young and inexperienced; and he had been
taught by Louis to believe that the alliance of Warwick
and Margaret would conquer all obstacles.

At length, when the winter passed and the spring
came, when the winds were still and the sea calm,
the queen and the Prince of Wales embarked once
more, and left the French coast behind. Landing
at Weymouth on the 14th of April, they went to
the Abbey of Cearne to repose from the fatigues of
their voyage before taking their way to the capital,
where they anticipated a joyous welcome. But a[Pg 281]
bitter disappointment was reserved for the royal
wanderers. The prince, instead of finding a throne
at Westminster, was doomed to fill a bloody grave
at Tewkesbury. Margaret, instead of entering London
in triumph, was led thither a captive, when a
terrible defeat had destroyed hope, and a tragic catastrophe
had dissipated ambition.



[Pg 282]




CHAPTER XXIX.

THE BATTLE OF BARNET.


Memorable was the spring of 1471 destined to
be in the history of England's baronage, and in the
annals of the Wars of "the pale and the purple
rose."

From the day that the warriors of the White
Rose       thanks to Montagu's supineness in the cause
of the Red       were allowed to pass the Trent on their
progress southward, a great battle between Edward
and Warwick became inevitable; and as the king,
without any desire to avoid a collision with the earl,
led a Yorkist army toward London, the earl, with
every determination to insist on a conflict with the
king, mustered a Lancastrian army at Coventry.

England, it was plain, could not, for many days
longer, hold both Edward and Warwick. Each
was animated by an intense antipathy to the other,
and both panted for the hour that was to bring their
mortal feud to the arbitrament of the sword. The
circumstances were altogether unfavorable to compromise
or delay; and events hurried on with a rapidity
corresponding to the characters of the rival
chiefs. While Edward Plantagenet was taking possession[Pg 283]
of London, Richard Neville was advancing,
by the high northern road, toward the capital; and,
almost ere the king had time to do more than remove
his spouse from the sanctuary of Westminster
to Baynard's Castle, the trumpet of war summoned
him to an encounter with the king-maker.

Warwick's rendezvous was Coventry; and to that
city, at the earl's call, hastened thousands of men, to
repair the loss which he had sustained by the defection
of Clarence. Thither came Henry of Exeter
and Edmund Somerset; and John De Vere, Earl
of Oxford, with a host of warriors devoted to the
house of Lancaster; and John Neville, Marquis of
Montagu, who, although not supposed to relish the
company of Lancastrians, appeared eager in his
brother's quarrel to sacrifice the prejudices of his
life and redeem the fatal error he had committed at
Pontefract.

At this stage of affairs, the Duke of Clarence endeavored
to open a door for the earl's reconciliation
to the king. Such an attempt was indeed hopeless;
but the duke, perhaps suffering some twinges of
conscience on account of his treachery, sent to excuse
himself for changing sides, and to entreat Warwick
to make peace with Edward. His message
was treated with lofty scorn. "I would rather,"
said the earl, "die true to myself, than live like
that false and perjured duke; and I vow not, until[Pg 284]
I have either lost my life or subdued mine enemies,
to lay down the sword to which I have appealed."

With a resolution not to be broken, Warwick,
with Oxford leading his van, marched from Coventry;
and, hoping to arrest the Yorkist army ere the
king was admitted into London, he advanced southward
with all speed. Learning, however, that the
archbishop had proved false, and that the citizens
had proved obsequious, the earl, on reaching St. Albans,
halted to allow his men to repose from their
fatigues, and on Saturday moved forward to Barnet,
standing on a hill midway between St. Albans and
London. Here the earl, resolving to await the approach
of his royal foe, called a halt; and, having
ordered his vanguard to take possession of the little
town, he encamped on a heath known as Gladsmuir,
and forming part of an extensive chase, stocked
with beasts of game.

The king did not long keep the earl waiting. No
sooner did the martial monarch hear that his great
foe had left Coventry and was approaching the metropolis,
than he girded on his armor, with a heart
as fearless of the issue as had animated the mightiest
of his ancestors when, on a summer morning, he
marched to Evesham to strike down the puissance
of Simon de Montfort. It was with no faint hopes
of success, indeed, that, at the head of an army devoted
to his cause, Edward, clad in magnificent armor,[Pg 285]
and mounted on a white steed, with crimson
caparisons, lined with blue and embroidered with
flowers of gold, rode out of London, cheered by the
good wishes of the citizens, surrounded by the companions
of his exile, and attended by George of
Clarence, whom he could not prudently trust elsewhere,
and by Henry of Windsor, whom he could
not safely leave behind.

On the afternoon of Saturday Edward left London,
and late in the evening of that day he reached
Barnet. As the Yorkist army approached the town,
the king's outriders, meeting those of the earl, chased
them past the embattled tower of the church dedicated
to St. John, and advanced till, through the
darkness, they perceived the army of Warwick. On
being informed that the earl was so near, the king
ordered his army to move through Barnet, and encamped
in the darkness, close to the foe, on Gladsmuir
Heath. The king took up his quarters for the
night in the town, and his soldiers lay on the heath.
They had no sleep, however, for so near was the
Lancastrian camp that the voices of men and the
neighing of horses were distinctly heard.

Both armies had artillery; and Warwick's guns
were, during the night, fired perseveringly at the
foe. The king, it appears, did not reply to this
salutation. Indeed, Edward early discovered that
the Lancastrians were unaware of the exact position[Pg 286]
of the Yorkist army, and thanked his stars that such
was the case; for, though Edward's intention had
been to place his men immediately in front of their
foes, the darkness had prevented him from perceiving
the extent of Warwick's lines, and thus it happened
that, while ranging his forces so as far to outstride
the earl's left wing, he had failed to place them
over against the right. Seldom has an error in war
proved so fortunate for a general. The earl happened
to have all his artillery posted in the right
division of his army, and concluded that the Yorkists
were within reach. Edward, as the fire from
Warwick's guns flashed red through the darkness,
saw the advantage he had unintentionally gained,
and issued strict orders that none of his guns should
be fired, lest the enemy "should have guessed the
ground, and so leveled their artillery to his annoyance."
This precaution was successful, and the
earl's gunners thundered till daybreak without producing
any effect.

Ere the first streak of day glimmered in the sky,
the armies were in motion; and when the morning
of Easter Sunday dawned, a flourish of trumpets
and a solemn tolling from the bell of the Church of
St. John aroused the inhabitants of Barnet, and announced
that the game of carnage was about to begin.
The weather was by no means favorable for
that display of martial chivalry which, in sunshine,[Pg 287]
the field would have presented to the eyes of spectators.
The morning was damp and dismal. A
thick fog overshadowed the heath; and the mist
hung so closely over both armies that neither Yorkists
nor Lancastrians could see their foes, save at
intervals. The fighting men of that age were as
superstitious as their neighbors; and the soldiers on
both sides concluded that the mists had been raised
to favor the king by Friar Bungey, the potent magician
whose spells were supposed to have raised the
wind that kept Margaret of Anjou from the shores
of England.

Nevertheless, at break of day the earl ordered his
trumpets to sound, and proceeded to set his men in
battle order. The task was one of no small delicacy;
but it seems to have been performed with great
judgment. Though Warwick was the soul and
right arm of the Lancastrian army, the battle was
so arranged as to give no umbrage to the time-tried
champions of the Red Rose. The centre host, consisting
chiefly of archers and bill-men, was commanded
by Somerset; Oxford, who appears to have
been trusted by the Lancastrians, shared the command
of the right wing with the conqueror of Hexham;
and, in command of the left, Exeter, who had
helped to lose battle after battle, had the distinction
of participating with "the setter-up and plucker-down
of kings."

[Pg 288]
Meanwhile, Edward had roused himself from his
repose, arrayed himself royally for the battle, placed
on his head a basnet surrounded with a crown of
ornament, mounted his white charger       in that age
regarded as the symbol of sovereignty       and taken
the field to vindicate his right to the throne of his
two great namesakes who reposed at Westminster
in the Confessor's Chapel.

Edward, in marshaling his army, had to contend
with none of the difficulties that beset Warwick.
The Yorkist army was devoted to his cause, as the
chief of the White Rose; and the captains shared
each other's political sympathies and antipathies.
Moreover, they were the king's own kinsmen and
friends       kinsmen who had partaken of his prosperity,
and were eager to contribute to his triumph       friends
who had accompanied him into exile, and
were ready to die in his defense. Under such circumstances,
the disposition of the Yorkist army was
easily made. Edward, keeping the fickle Clarence
and the feeble Henry in close attendance, took the
command of the centre, and was opposed to that
part of the Lancastrian forces commanded by Somerset.
At the head of the right wing was placed
Gloucester, though still in his teens, to cope with
Exeter, the husband of his sister, and Warwick, the
sworn friend of his sire. At the head of the left
was posted Hastings, to face his brothers-in-law,[Pg 289]
Oxford and Montagu. Besides these divisions, the
king kept a body of choice troops in reserve to render
aid, as the day sped on, where aid should be
most required.

Agreeably to the custom of the period, the king
and the earl addressed their adherents, each asserting
the justice of his cause       Edward denouncing
the patrician hero as rebel and traitor; while Warwick
branded his royal adversary as usurper and
tyrant. This ceremony over, the hostile armies
joined battle. At first fortune with fickle smile
favored the Lancastrians. The error made by the
Yorkists in taking up their position on the previous
evening now caused them serious inconvenience.
In fact, the Lancastrian right wing, composed of
horsemen, so overlapped the king's troops opposed
to them that Oxford and Montagu were enabled to
crush Hastings as in a serpent's fold. The Yorkist
left wing was completely discomfited; and many of
the men spurred out of the fog, escaped from the
field, dashed through Barnet, galloped along the
high north road to London, and excused their flight
by reporting that the earl had won the day.

The conclusion at which the fugitives had arrived
was quite premature. Indeed, could these doughty
champions of the White Rose have seen what was
passing in other parts of the field, they would probably
have postponed their ride to the capital. Fearful[Pg 290]
difficulties encompassed the right wing of the
Lancastrian army. Gloucester was proving how
formidable a war-chief a Plantagenet could be even
in his teens, and enacting his part with such skill
and courage as would have done credit to warriors
who had led the Yorkists to victory at Towton and
Northampton. With an eye that few things escaped,
the boy-duke availed himself of the advantage
which Montagu and Oxford had turned to such
account in their struggle with Hastings; and, urging
on the assault with characteristic ferocity, he
succeeded in placing his adversaries in the unfortunate
predicament to which the left wing of the
Yorkists had already been reduced. At the same
time, the Lancastrians opposed to Gloucester were
dispirited by the fall of Exeter, who sunk to the
ground wounded with an arrow; and so dense continued
the fog over Gladsmuir Heath that they were
not even consoled with the knowledge of Oxford's
signal success. Edward, however, early became
aware that his left wing had been destroyed, and
charged the Lancastrian centre with such vigor as
threw Somerset's ranks into confusion.

The ignorance of the Lancastrians as to the success
of their right wing, was not the only disadvantage
they suffered from the fog. The soldiers considered
the dense watery vapors not as ordinary exhalations,
but as supernatural means used by Friar[Pg 291]
Bungey to aid the Yorkist cause; and, from the
beginning, the gloom had been decidedly favorable
to Edward's operations. Ere the battle long continued,
the fog did better service to the king than
could have been rendered to him by hundreds of
knights.

Among the retainers of feudal magnates of that
age it was the fashion to wear a badge to indicate
the personage whose banner they followed. From
the time of the Crusades the badge of the house of
De Vere had been a star with streams; and from
the morning of Mortimer's Cross, the cognizance of
the house of York had a sun in splendor. At Barnet,
Oxford's men had the star embroidered on their
coats; Edward's men the sun on their coats. The
devices bore such a resemblance that, seen through a
fog, one might easily be mistaken for the other; and
it happened that on Gladsmuir Heath there was such
a mistake.

When Oxford had pursued the Yorkists under
Hastings to the verge of the Heath, it occurred to
him that he might render a signal service to his
party by wheeling round and smiting Edward's centre
in the flank. Unfortunately some Lancastrian
archers, who perceived without comprehending this
movement, mistook De Vere's star, in the mist, for
Edward's sun, drew their bows to the head, and
sent a flight of shafts rattling against the mail of the[Pg 292]
approaching cavalry. Oxford's horsemen instantly
shouted "Treason! treason! we are all betrayed!"
and Oxford, amazed at such treatment from his own
party, and bewildered by the cry of "Treason!"
that now came from all directions, concluded that
there was foul play, and rode off the field at the
head of eight hundred men.

The plight of the Lancastrians was now rapidly
becoming desperate; and Edward hastened their
ruin by urging fresh troops upon their disordered
ranks. Warwick, however, showed no inclination
to yield. "The Stout Earl" in fact had been little
accustomed to defeat; and such was the terror of
his name that, on former occasions, the cry of "A
Warwick! A Warwick!" had been sufficient to
decide the fate of a field. But at St. Albans, at
Northampton, and at Towton Field, the earl's triumphs
had been achieved over Beauforts, Hollands,
and Tudors, men of ordinary courage and average
intellect. At Barnet he was in the presence of a
warrior of prowess and a war-chief of pride, whose
heart was not less bold, and whose eye was still
more skillful than his own.

Edward, in fact, could not help perceiving that
nothing but a violent effort was now required to
complete his victory. Up to this stage he appears
to have issued commands to his friends with the
skill of a Plantagenet: he now executed vengeance[Pg 293]
on his foes with the cruelty of a Mortimer. Mounted
on his white steed, with his teeth firmly set, the
spur pressing his horse's side, and his right hand
lifted up to slay, he charged the disheartened Lancastrians,
bearing down all opposition; and, instead
of crying, as on former occasions, "Smite the captains,
but spare the commons!" he said, "Spare
none who favor the rebel earl!"

While the king's steed was bearing him over the
field, and his arm was doing fearful execution on the
foe, the king-maker's operations were, unfortunately
for the Lancastrian cause, limited to a single spot.
In former battles, with a memorable exception,
Warwick had fought on horseback. When mounted,
the earl had been in the habit of riding from
rank to rank to give orders, of breaking, with his
sword or his battle-axe in hand, into the enemy's
lines, with the cry of "A Warwick! A Warwick!"
and encouraging his army by deeds of prowess,
wherever the presence of a daring leader was most
necessary. At Barnet, however, he had been prevailed
on to dismount, and send his steed away, that
he might thus, as when he killed his horse at Towton,
prove to his adherents that he was determined
never to leave the field till he was either a conqueror
or a corpse. Most unfortunate for the earl proved
this deviation from his ordinary custom, when the
day wore on and the men grew weary, and looked[Pg 294]
in vain for the presence of their chief to cheer their
spirits and sustain their courage.

It was seven o'clock when the fight began. Long
ere noon both wings of the Lancastrian army had
vanished, and the chiefs of the Red Rose had disappeared
from the field. Oxford had fled to avoid
being betrayed. Somerset had fled to escape death.
Exeter, abandoned by his attendants, lay on the cold
heath of Gladsmuir among the dead and dying.
But Warwick was resolved that the battle should
only terminate with his life; and, at the head of the
remaining division, opposed to the Yorkists whom
Edward commanded in person, the earl posted himself
for a final effort to avert his doom. Montagu,
it would appear, was by his brother's side.

More furiously than ever now raged the battle;
and far fiercer than hitherto was the struggle that
took place. Opposed more directly to each other
than they had previously been, the king and the
earl exerted their prowess to the utmost       one animated
by hope, the other urged by despair. The
example of such leaders was not, of course, lost; and
men of all ranks in the two armies strained every
nerve, and struggled hand to hand with their adversaries.


"Groom fought like noble, squire like knight,
As fearlessly and well."


On both sides the slaughter had been considerable.[Pg 295]
On Edward's side Lord Say and Sir John
Lisle, Lord Cromwell and Sir Humphrey Bourchier,
with about fifteen hundred soldiers, bit the dust.
On Warwick's side twenty-three knights, among
whom was Sir William Tyrrel, and three thousand
fighting men fell to rise no more. At length, after
a bloody and obstinate contest had been maintained,
Edward saw that the time had arrived to strike a
sure and shattering blow. There still remained a
body of Yorkists who had been kept in reserve for
any emergency. The king ordered up these fresh
troops, and led them to the assault. Warwick fronted
this new peril with haughty disdain; and, in accents
of encouragement, appealed to his remaining
adherents to persevere. "This," said he, "is their
last resource. If we withstand this one charge the
field will yet be ours." But the earl's men, jaded
and fatigued, could not encounter such fearful odds
with success; and Warwick had the mortification
of finding that his call was no longer answered by
his friends, and that his battle-cry no longer sounded
terrible to his foes.

Warwick could not now have entertained any delusions
as to the issue of the conflict. He was conquered,
and he must have felt such to be the case.
The disaster was irremediable, and left him no hope.
The descendant of Cospatrick did not stoop to ask
for mercy, as Simon de Montfort had done under[Pg 296]
somewhat similar circumstances, only to be told
there was none for such a traitor; nor did he, by a
craven flight, tarnish the splendid fame which he had
won on many a stricken field. Life, in fact, could
not any longer have charms for him; and, ceasing to
hope for victory, he did not feel any wish to survive
defeat. A glorious death only awaited the king-maker       such
a death as history should record in
words of admiration and poets celebrate in strains
of praise.

Under such circumstances, the great earl ventured
desperately into the thickest of the conflict; and,
sword in hand, threw himself valiantly among countless
enemies. Death, which he appeared to seek,
did not shun him; and he faced the king of terrors
with an aspect as fearless as he had ever presented
to Henry or to Edward. The king-maker died as
he had lived. In the melancholy hour which closed
his career       betrayed by the wily archbishop; deserted
by the perjured Clarence; abandoned on the
field by his new allies; and conquered by the man
whom he had set on a throne       even in that hour,
the bitterest perhaps of his life, Warwick was Warwick
still; and Montagu, perhaps caring little to
survive the patriot earl, rushed in to his rescue, and
fell by his side.

Naturally enough, the Yorkists breathed more
freely after Warwick's fall; and, with some reason,[Pg 297]
they believed that the last hopes of Lancaster had
been trodden out on the field of Barnet. Edward,
as he rode from the scene of carnage toward London,
imagined his throne absolutely secure; and, not
dreaming that ere a few days he would have to gird
on his armor for a struggle hardly less severe than
that out of which he had come a conqueror, the king
made a triumphal entry into the capital, repaired to
St. Paul's, presented his standard as an offering, and
returned thanks to God for giving him such a victory
over his enemies.

The bodies of Warwick and Montagu were placed
in one coffin, conveyed to London, and exposed for
three days at St. Paul's, that all who desired might
assure themselves that the great earl and his brother
no longer lived. Even Warwick's death did not appease
Edward's hatred; and he would have cared
little to refuse interment befitting the earl's rank
to the corpse of the departed hero. The king, however,
mourned the death of Montagu; and, from regard
to the memory of the marquis, he ordered that
both brothers should be laid among their maternal
ancestors.

During the fourteenth century, one of those Earls
of Salisbury, whose name is associated with the era
of English chivalry and with the noblest of European
orders, had founded an abbey at Bisham, in Berkshire.
This religious house, which stood hard by[Pg 298]
the River Thames, and had become celebrated as
the sepulchre of the illustrious family which the
king-maker, through his mother, represented, was
chosen as the last resting-place of Warwick and of
the brother who fought and fell with him at Barnet.
At the Reformation, Bisham Abbey was destroyed;
and, unfortunately, nothing was left to
mark the spot where repose the ashes of "The Stout
Earl," whom Shakspeare celebrates as the "proud
setter-up and puller-down of kings."



[Pg 299]




CHAPTER XXX.

BEFORE TEWKESBURY.


It was Easter Sunday, in the year 1471, and the
battle of Barnet had been fought. Exeter lay
stretched among the dead and the dying on the
blood-stained heath of Gladsmuir; Oxford was spurring
toward the north; Somerset was escaping toward
the west; Henry of Windsor had been led
back to his prison in the Tower; the bodies of
Warwick and Montagu were being conveyed in one
coffin to St. Paul's; and Edward of York was at the
metropolitan cathedral, offering his standard upon
the altar, and returning thanks to God for his victory
over the Red Rose of Lancaster and the flower
of the ancient nobility, when Margaret of Anjou
once more set foot on the shores of England. Nor,
in circumstances so inauspicious, did she arrive as
a solitary victim. Accompanied by the son of the
captive king and the daughter of the fallen earl,
and attended by Lord Wenlock, Sir John Fortescue,
and the Prior of St. John's, came the Lancastrian
queen on that day when the wounded were dying,
and the riflers prying, and the ravens flying over the
field of Barnet.

[Pg 300]

At Weymouth, on the coast of Devon, Margaret
landed with the Prince and Princess of Wales.
From Weymouth, the ill-starred queen was escorted
to the Abbey of Cearne, a religious house in the
neighborhood. While at Cearne, resting from the
fatigues of her voyage, she was informed of the defeat
of the Lancastrians and the death of Warwick.

Margaret had hitherto, through all perils and
perplexities, been sustained by her high spirit. She
had won the reputation of being one of the race of
steel, who felt her soul brighten in danger, and who
never knew fear without such a feeling being succeeded
by a blush at having yielded to such weakness.
On hearing of the defeat at Barnet, however,
she evinced the utmost alarm, raised her hands to
heaven, closed her eyes, and, in a state of bewilderment,
sunk swooning to the ground. Her first
idea, on recovering consciousness, was to return to
France; but, meanwhile, for the sake of personal
safety, she hastened to the Abbey of Beaulieu, in
Hampshire, and registered herself and her whole
party as persons availing themselves of the privilege
of sanctuary.

A rumor of the queen's arrival reached the chiefs
of the Red Rose party; and to Beaulieu, without
delay, went Somerset, with his brother, John Beaufort,
whom the Lancastrians called Marquis of
Dorset, and John, Earl of Devon, head of the great[Pg 301]
house of Courtenay. These noblemen found Margaret
plunged in grief, and resolved on returning to
France till God should send her better fortune.
Their presence, however, in some degree, revived
the courage which had so often shone forth in adversity;
and Somerset strongly urged her to brave
fortune and the foe on another field. With the utmost
difficulty Margaret was brought to consent to
the proposal, and even then she hesitated and grew
pale. Indeed, the ill-fated heroine confessed that
she feared for her son, and intimated her wish that
he should be sent to France, there to remain till a
victory had been won. But to this scheme decided
opposition was expressed. Somerset and the Lancastrian
lords argued that the Prince of Wales should
remain in England to lead the adherents of the Red
Rose to battle, "he being," as they said, "the morning
sun of the Lancastrian hopes, the rays of which
were very resplendent to meet English eyes;" and
the royal boy, we can well believe, was prepared
rather to die at once on a field of fame, than live
through years of exile to expire in inglorious obscurity.

At length Margaret yielded to the general wish,
and the Lancastrian chiefs formed their plans for
mustering an army. No insuperable difficulties
presented themselves. Shortly before Barnet was
fought, John Beaufort and the Earl of Devon had[Pg 302]
gone westward from Coventry to levy forces, and
Jasper Tudor had been sent into Wales on a similar
errand. The idea of the Lancastrians was to draw
together the men enlisted in the west, to join Jasper
Tudor, who was still zealously recruiting in Wales,
to secure the services of the archers in which Lancashire
and Cheshire abounded, and to summon the
prickers of the northern counties to that standard
under which they had conquered at Wakefield and
Bernard's Heath. The plan of campaign was, as
we shall hereafter see, such as to place Edward's
throne in considerable peril; and the imaginations
of the Lancastrian chiefs caught fire at the prospect
of triumph. Somerset openly boasted that the Red
Rose party was rather strengthened than enfeebled
by Warwick's fall; and Oxford, who had recovered
from the bewilderment which had lost his friends a
victory at Barnet, wrote to his countess, Warwick's
sister, "Be of good cheer, and take no thought, for
I shall bring my purpose about now by the grace
of God."

Unfortunately for the champions of the Red Rose,
they had to contend with no ordinary antagonist.
Almost ere they had formed their plans, the king
was aware that they were in motion; and, somewhat
alarmed, he faced the new danger with the energy
and spirit that had laid Warwick low. Within
a week after his victory at Barnet, Edward, having[Pg 303]
placed Henry of Windsor securely in the Tower, and
also committed George Neville, Archbishop of York,
to the metropolitan fortress, marched from London
with such forces as were at hand; and at Windsor,
within the castle of his regal ancestors, he remained
nearly a week to celebrate the feast of St. George,
to await the remainder of his troops, and to obtain
such intelligence of the enemy's movements as might
enable him to defeat their project. As yet the king
was utterly uncertain whether the Red Rose chiefs
intended marching toward London or leading their
adherents northward. His predicament was, therefore,
awkward. If he hastened on to protect the
north from being invaded, he left London at their
mercy; if he remained to guard the capital, he left
the north free to their incursions. The king's great
object, under such circumstances, was to bring the
Lancastrians to battle at the earliest possible period.
His army, indeed, was small; but, as affairs then
were, he had little hope of its being increased; and
he appears to have placed much reliance on the
artillery, with which he was well provided. But,
anxious as Edward might be to meet his foes face
to face, he checked his natural impetuosity, and declined
to advance a mile without having calculated
the consequences.

Meanwhile, the Lancastrian standard was set up
at Exeter, and to "the London of the West" the[Pg 304]
men of Devon, Somerset, and Cornwall were invited
to repair. The Red Rose chiefs perfectly comprehended
the dilemma in which Edward was placed,
and were prepared to act just as circumstances rendered
safe and expedient. If they could draw their
potent foe from the neighborhood of London, they
would march on the metropolis. If they could keep
him in the neighborhood of London, they would
cross the Severn, join Jasper Tudor, march into
Lancashire and Cheshire, and raise the men of the
north to overturn the Yorkist throne. One thing
they did not desire       that was an early meeting with
the conqueror of Towton and Barnet.

At Exeter, Margaret of Anjou, with the Prince
and Princess of Wales, joined the adherents of the
Red Rose, and prepared for those military operations
which, she hoped, would hurl Edward of York
from the throne. Ere venturing upon the terrible
task, however, the queen, with the Lancastrian
chiefs, made a progress throughout the west to collect
recruits. From Exeter she proceeded with this
object to Bath, a town which then consisted of a few
hundreds of houses, crowded within an old wall,
hard by the Avon, and which derived some renown
from those springs whose healing qualities Bladud
had discovered under the guidance of hogs, and
whose virtues had recommended the place to the
Romans when they came to Britain as resistless conquerors.

[Pg 305]

At Bath, Margaret's friends learned that Edward
was watching her movements with a vigilance that
rendered an early junction with Jasper Tudor extremely
desirable; and, having considerably increased
in number, the Lancastrians took their way
to Bristol, a town with strong walls, which the
Flemings, brought over by Philippa of Hainault,
had made the seat of an extensive woolen trade.

The inhabitants of Bristol had manifested much
loyalty to Edward, when, during the harvest-time
of 1462, the young Yorkist king appeared within
their walls, and executed Sir Baldwin Fulford and
other Lancastrians. Since that event, celebrated by
Chatterton as "The Bristowe Tragedy," well-nigh
nine years had elapsed, and, during that time, their
attention had been attracted from the Wars of the
Roses to a war nearer home. It is probable that
the contentions of York and Lancaster had excited
less interest than the feud between the houses of
Berkeley and Lisle; and that the field of Barnet
had created less excitement than that of Nibley
Green, where, one March morning in 1470, William
Lord Berkeley and Thomas Talbot, Lord Lisle,
fought that battle known as "The English Chevy
Chase."

But, however loyal the citizens of Bristol might
be to Edward of York, they knew that Margaret
of Anjou was not a woman to be trifled with; and,[Pg 306]
however little they might relish the spectacle of
Lancastrian warriors crowding their streets, they
were ready enough to furnish the Red Rose chiefs
with money, provisions, and artillery. After receiving
these supplies, the Lancastrian queen, anxious
to cross the Severn, relieved Bristol of her
presence on the 2d of May       it was a Thursday       and
led her army toward that valley which, of old,
had been depicted by William of Malmesbury as rich
in fruit and corn, and abounding in vineyards.

The king's pursuit of his enemies had, in the mean
time, been at once absorbing as a game of chess and
exciting as a fox-hunt. For a time, he was unable
to comprehend their movements, and forced to act
with extreme caution. Indeed, Edward was not unaware
that the Lancastrian leaders were exercising
their utmost energy to outwit him; and he knew
full well that one false step on his part would, in
all likelihood, decide the campaign in their favor.
At length, becoming aware that they were spreading
rumors of their intention to advance to London
by Oxford and Reading, the king concluded that
their real intention was to march northward; and,
leading his army forth from Windsor, he encamped
at Abingdon, a town of Berkshire, on the River
Thames. Learning, at Abingdon, that Margaret
and her captains were still at Wells, he moved a
little northward to Cirencester, in Gloucestershire,[Pg 307]
and was then informed that the Lancastrians were
about to leave Bath and give him battle on the 1st
of May       the anniversary of his ill-judged and ill-starred
marriage.

Eager for a conflict, the king marched his army
out of the town of Cirencester, and, encamping in
the neighboring fields, awaited the arrival of his foes.
Edward soon found, however, that he had been deceived;
and, in hopes of finding them, marched to
Malmesbury, in Wiltshire. Learning, at that town,
that the Lancastrians had turned aside to Bristol,
he went to Sodbury, a place about ten miles distant
from the emporium of the west: and, at Sodbury,
from the circumstances of his men, while riding
into the town to secure quarters, encountering a
body of the enemy's outriders, and the Lancastrians
having sent forward men to take their ground on
Sodbury Hill, he believed that their army was at no
great distance. Eager for intelligence, Edward sent
light horsemen to scour the country, and encamped
on Sodbury Hill. About midnight on Thursday,
scouts came into the camp, and Edward's suspense
was terminated. It appeared beyond doubt that the
Lancastrians were on full march from Bristol to
Gloucester; and the king, awake to the crisis, lost
no time in holding a council of war. A decision
was rapidly arrived at; and a messenger dispatched
post-haste to Richard, Lord Beauchamp of Powicke,[Pg 308]
then Governor of Gloucester, with instructions to
refuse the Lancastrians admittance and a promise
to relieve the city forthwith in case of its being assailed.

Events now hastened rapidly onward. The king's
messenger had no time to lose; for the Lancastrian
army, having marched all night, was pushing on toward
the vale of Gloucester. The vale, as the reader
may be aware, is semicircular       the Severn forming
the chord, the Cotswold Hills the arc; and
Cheltenham, Gloucester, and Tewkesbury making a
triangle with its area. Into the second of these
towns Margaret expected to be admitted; and she
calculated on being enabled, under the protection
of its walls and castle, to pass the Severn without
interruption, and to form a junction with Jasper
Tudor, who was all bustle and enthusiasm in Wales.

A grievous disappointment awaited the Lancastrian
army       a bitter mortification the Lancastrian
queen. On Friday morning, a few hours after sunrise,
Margaret of Anjou, with the warriors of the
Red Rose, appeared before Gloucester. But Beauchamp,
having received Edward's message, positively
refused to open the gates; and when Margaret,
with a heavy heart, turned aside and proceeded toward
Tewkesbury, he still farther displayed his
Yorkist zeal by hanging on the rear of the Lancastrians
and doing them all the mischief he could.[Pg 309]
Even Somerset must have confessed that the aspect
of affairs was now the reverse of bright; and, after
leaving Gloucester behind, every thing began to go
wrong. The march lay through woods and lanes,
and over stony ground; and the soldiers, hungry
and foot-sore, were oppressed with the heat of the
weather. Moreover, the peasantry, inclined, for
some reason or other, to oppose the progress of the
Lancastrians, secured the fords by which the Severn
might have been crossed; and Beauchamp not only
harassed the rear of the queen's army, but succeeded
in capturing some artillery, which she was in no
condition to spare. At length, on Friday afternoon,
after having marched thirty-six miles, without
rest, and almost without food, the Lancastrians,
weary and dispirited, reached Tewkesbury, a little
town standing on the left bank of the Severn, and
deriving some dignity from a Norman abbey, known
far and wide as the sepulchre of a mighty race of
barons, whose chiefs fought at Evesham and fell at
Bannockburn. At this place, which had been inherited
from the De Clares, through Beauchamps
and Despensers, by the Countess of Warwick, the
Lancastrian leaders halted to refresh their men.

Early on that morning, when the queen and her
captains appeared before Gloucester, Edward left
Sodbury, and led his army over the Cotswolds,
whose sheep and shepherds old Drayton has celebrated.[Pg 310]
His soldiers suffered much from heat, and
still more for want of water; only meeting, on their
way, with one brook, the water of which, as men and
horses dashed in, was soon rendered unfit for use.
Onward, however, in spite of heat and thirst, as if
prescient of victory, pressed Edward's soldiers, sometimes
within five miles of their enemies       the Yorkists
in a champaign country, and the Lancastrians
among woods       but the chiefs of both armies directing
their march toward the same point. At length,
after having marched more than thirty miles, the
Yorkists reached a little village situated on the
River Chelt, secluded in the vale of Gloucester, and
consisting of a few thatched cottages forming a
straggling street near a church with an ancient
spire, which had been erected in honor of St. Mary
before the Plantagenets came to rule in England.
At this hamlet, which the saline springs, discovered
some centuries later by the flight of pigeons, have
metamorphosed into a beautiful and luxurious city,
Edward halted to recruit the energies and refresh
the spirits of his followers. At Cheltenham
the king received intelligence that the foe was at
Tewkesbury; and, marching in that direction, he
encamped for the night in a field hard by the Lancastrian
camp.

Ere the king reached Cheltenham the Lancastrians
had formed their plans. On arriving at Tewkesbury,[Pg 311]
Somerset, aware that the Yorkists were fast
approaching, intimated his intention to remain and
give Edward battle. Margaret, as if with the presentiment
of a tragic catastrophe, was all anxiety to
cross the Severn; and many of the captains sympathized
with their queen's wish. Somerset, however,
carried his point; and, indeed, it is not easy to
comprehend how the Lancastrians could, under the
circumstances, have attempted a passage without exposing
their rear to certain destruction. Somerset's
opinion on any subject may not have been worth
much; but he does not appear to have been in the
wrong when he decided on encamping at Tewkesbury,
and when he declared his intention there to
abide such fortune as God should send.

So at Tewkesbury, through that summer night,
within a short distance of each other, the armies of
York and Lancaster, under the sons of those who,
years before, had plucked the roses in the Temple
Garden, and encountered with mortal hatred in the
streets of St. Albans, animated moreover by such
vindictive feelings as the memory of friends and
kinsmen slain in the field and executed on the scaffold
could not fail to inspire, awaited the light of
another day, to fight their twelfth battle for the
crown of England.



[Pg 312]




CHAPTER XXXI.

THE FIELD OF TEWKESBURY.


On Saturday the 4th of May, 1471, ere the bell
of Tewkesbury Abbey tolled "the sweet hour of
prime," or the monks had assembled to sing the
morning hymn, King Edward was astir and making
ready to attack the Lancastrians.

Mounted on a brown charger, with his magnificent
person clad in Milan steel, a crown of ornament
around his helmet, and the arms of France
and England quarterly on his shield, the king set
his men in order for the assault. The van of the
Yorkist army was committed to Richard, Duke of
Gloucester, whose skill and courage on the field of
Barnet had made him, at nineteen, the hero among
those of whom, at thirty, he was to be the headsman.
The centre host Edward commanded in person;
and by the side of the royal warrior figured
the ill-starred Clarence, never again to be fully
trusted by his brother. The rear was intrusted to
the guidance of Lord Hastings, and to Elizabeth
Woodville's eldest son, Thomas Grey, Marquis of
Dorset. Thus arrayed, flushed with recent victory
over mighty adversaries, the Yorkist warriors, in all[Pg 313]
the pride of valor, and all the confidence of victory,
prepared to advance upon their foes.

Meanwhile, the Red Rose chiefs were not idle.
Having encamped south of the town of Tewkesbury,
on some rising ground, part of which is still
known as "Queen Margaret's Camp," the Lancastrians
appear to have made the most of their advantages.
Defended as they were in their rear by
the Abbey, and in front and on both sides by
hedges, lanes, and ditches, they intrenched their
position strongly, in the hope of keeping Edward at
bay till the arrival of Jasper Tudor, who was believed
to be rapidly approaching; and, at the same
time, they left openings in their intrenchments,
through which, should such a course seem expedient,
they might sally forth upon the assailing foe.

Their camp thus fortified, the Lancastrian leaders
disposed the army of the Red Rose in three divisions.
Of the first of these Somerset, aided by his brother,
John Beaufort, took the command; the second was
committed to the auspices of Edward, Prince of
Wales, the Prior of St. John, and Lord Wenlock,
who, having shared the Lancastrian defeat at St.
Albans and the Yorkist triumph at Towton, had
once more, in an evil hour, placed Queen Margaret's
badge on his gorget; and the third was confided
to the Earl of Devon, the youngest of three
brothers, two of whom, after wearing the coronet of[Pg 314]
the Courtenays, had died on the scaffold for their
fidelity to the Red Rose.

While the Lancastrians were forming their line of
battle, King Edward gave the order to advance; and,
with banners displayed, with clarions and trumpets
sounding a march, and with Gloucester leading the
van, and perhaps even then dreaming of a crown,
the Yorkist army moved forward, gay with knights
and nobles in rich armor and broidered vests, their
lances gleaming in the merry sunshine, their plumes
and pennons dancing in the morning breeze, and
their mailed steeds, with chaffrons of steel projecting
from barbed frontals, caracoling at the touch of
the spur. Within a mile of the Lancastrian camp
Edward halted his men; and his large blue eye,
which took in the whole position of his enemies,
wandered jealously to the park of Tewkesbury,
which was situated to the right of Somerset's division.
Suspicious of an ambuscade, the Yorkist
king dispatched two hundred spearmen from his
army to proceed in that direction, and ordered
them, in case of their not finding any foe lurking
in the wood, to take such part in the battle as circumstances
should render expedient. Having satisfied
himself with this precaution, the king ordered
his banners to advance, and his trumpets to sound
an onset.

When the hour of conflict drew nigh, Margaret[Pg 315]
of Anjou, accompanied by the heir of Lancaster,
rode along the lines and addressed the adherents of
the Red Rose. Never, perhaps, had the daughter
of King René looked more queenly than on the field
of Tewkesbury; never had she enacted her part
with more art than she did on the eve of that catastrophe
which was to plunge her to the depths of
despair. Though sick at heart, and more than
doubtful as to the issue of the field, she assumed the
aspect of perfect confidence, and spoke as if inspired
with the hope of victory. Years of trouble had, of
course, destroyed those exquisite charms which in
youth had made Margaret famous as the beauty of
Christendom, but had not deprived her of the power
of subduing men to her purposes, even against their
better judgment. Though her countenance bore
traces of the wear and tear of anxious days and
sleepless nights, her presence exercised on the partisans
of the house of Lancaster an influence not
less potent than it had done in days when she possessed
a beauty that dazzled all eyes and fascinated
all hearts.

Nor did the heir of Lancaster appear, by any
means, unworthy of such a mother, as, armed complete
in mail, he accompanied her along the lines,
his standard borne by John Gower. Imagine the
boy-warrior, gifted as he was with all the graces of
rank and royalty, frankness and chivalry; his eye[Pg 316]
sparkling with the pride and valor of the Plantagenets;
the arms of France and England blazoned on
his shield, his tabard, and the caparisons of his horse,
and it will not be difficult to conceive the influence
which, in spite of his foreign accent, such a grandson
of the conqueror of Agincourt, uttering sentiments
worthy of the pupil of Fortescue in language
worthy of the son of Margaret of Anjou, exercised
on the Lancastrian host when about to encounter
the partisans of the White Rose.

Margaret of Anjou was not unaware of the effect
produced by the fair face and graceful figure of the
Prince of Wales. Glancing, with maternal pride,
at the royal boy, who rode at her right hand, she
reined in her palfrey, and, having with a gesture
obtained an audience, she encouraged her partisans,
in a voice promising victory, to do their duty valiantly
against Edward of York and prove their courage
on the crests of the usurper's adherents. "It
remained for them, the soldiers of the Red Rose,"
said the queen, in accents which quickened the pulse
and nerved the arm of the listeners, "to restore an
imprisoned king to liberty and his throne, and to secure
for themselves, not only safety, but distinctions
and rewards. Did the inequalities of number daunt
them? She could not doubt that their stout hearts,
animated by the justice of their cause, would enable
them to overcome in spite of disparity. Did they[Pg 317]
lack motives to be valiant against the foe? Let
them look upon the Prince of Wales, and fight for
him, their fellow-soldier, who was now to share their
fortune on the field; and who, once in possession of
his rights, would not forget those to whose courage
he owed the throne. The kingdom of England
should be their inheritance, to be divided among
them; the wealth of the rebellious cities should be
their spoil; they should be rewarded for their devotion
with all those titles which their enemies now
proudly wore; and, above all, they should enjoy lasting
fame and honor throughout the realm."

An enthusiastic response arose from the ranks of
the Lancastrians as their heroic queen concluded
her spirit-stirring address; and the warriors of the
Red Rose indicated, by signs not to be mistaken,
their alacrity to fight to the death for the rights of
such a mother and such a son. Perhaps, at that
moment, Margaret, infected with the excitement
which her own eloquence had created, almost persuaded
herself to hope. No hour was that, however,
to indulge in day-dreams. Ere the enthusiasm
of the Lancastrians had time to die away, Richard
of Gloucester had advanced his banner to their
camp, and the troops under the young duke were
storming the intrenchments.

Gloucester, as leader of the Yorkist van, found
himself opposed to the Lancastrians whom Somerset[Pg 318]
commanded in person; and, the ferocity of his
nature being doubtless inflamed by the hereditary
antipathy of the house of York to the house of Beaufort,
he made a furious assault. The onslaught of
the stripling war-chief, however, proved of no avail;
for the nature of the ground was such as to prevent
the Yorkists from coming hand to hand with their
foes, while the Lancastrians, posted among bushes
and trees, galled their assailants with showers of arrows.
Gloucester was somewhat cowed, but his
guile did not desert him. He assumed the air of a
man who was baffled, pretended to be repulsed, and,
retiring from the assault, contented himself with ordering
the artillery, with which the Yorkists were
better provided than their foes, to play upon the
Lancastrian ranks.

The aspect of the battle was now decidedly in favor
of the Red Rose, and such as to cause the Yorkists
some degree of anxiety. What the Lancastrians
wanted was a war-chief of courage and experience,
and Somerset neither had the talents nor the
experience requisite for the occasion. At the head
of that host on the banks of the Severn, such a man
as the fifth Henry, or John, Duke of Bedford, might,
by a decisive victory, have won back Margaret's
crown. But the grandson of Katherine Swynford
had not been intended by God and nature to cope
with the royal warrior who laid Warwick low.

[Pg 319]

Somerset had still to learn his incapacity for the
part he had undertaken to enact. As yet he was
under the influence of such a degree of vanity as
prompted him to the rashest courses. Elate at Gloucester's
retreat, and concluding that a determined
effort would render the Lancastrians victorious, the
shallow duke led his men through the openings that
had been left in their intrenchments. Descending
from the elevated ground, he charged Edward's centre
host with violence, drove that part of the Yorkist
army back, and then, with infinitely less prudence
than presumption, followed the wily Gloucester into
the open meadows.

Once fairly away from his intrenchments, the
Lancastrian leader found too late the error he had
committed. Gloucester's stratagem had been attended
with a success which even he could hardly
have anticipated. Suddenly wheeling round and
shouting their battle-cry, the boy-duke and the
Yorkists turned upon their pursuers with the fury
of lions; and, at the same time, the two hundred
spearmen who had been sent to guard against an
ambuscade in Tewkesbury Park came rushing to
the conflict, and made a vigorous attack upon Somerset's
flank. Taken by surprise, the Lancastrian
van fled in disorder. Some made for the park;
some ran toward the meadows; others flung themselves
into the ditches; and so many were beaten[Pg 320]
down and slain where they fought, that the greensward
was crimsoned with gore.

Gloucester did not pause in the work of destruction.
After cheering on his men to the carnage, he
pursued Somerset up the hill, availed himself of the
Lancastrians' confusion to force his way through
their intrenchments, and carried into their camp
that terror with which his grisly cognizance seldom
failed to inspire his enemies.

The plight of the Lancastrians now became desperate.
Somerset, having lost his followers, lost his
temper, and with it every chance of victory. Indeed,
the duke appears to have acted the part of a
madman. On reaching the camp, flushed and furious,
he looked around for a victim to sacrifice to his
rage, and made a selection which was singularly unfortunate
for the Lancastrians. Lord Wenlock, it
seems, had not left the camp to support Somerset's
charge; and the duke, bearing in mind how recently
that nobleman had been converted from the Yorkist
cause, rushed to the conclusion that he was playing
false. A fearful scene was the result. Riding to
the centre division of the Lancastrians, the exasperated
Beaufort reviled Lord Wenlock in language too
coarse to have been recorded, and, after denouncing
the aged warrior as traitor and coward, cleft his
skull with a battle-axe.

No incident could have been more unfavorable to[Pg 321]
the fortunes of the Red Rose than Wenlock's fall by
the hand of Somerset. A panic immediately seized
the Lancastrians; and, ere they could recover from
their confusion, King Edward perceived his advantage,
cheered his men to the onslaught, spurred over
hedge and ditch, and dashed, on his brown charger,
fiercely into the intrenched camp. Irresistible we
can well imagine the onset of that horse and that
rider to have been       the strong war-steed, with his
frontal of steel, making a way through the enemy's
disordered ranks, and the tall warrior dispersing all
around with the sweep of his terrible sword. Vain
was then the presence of the Prince of Wales, gallant
as the bearing of the royal boy doubtless was.
Indeed, all the princes of John of Gaunt's lineage
could not now have turned the tide of fight. After
a faint struggle, the Lancastrians recoiled in consternation;
and, throwing down their arms, fled before
Edward and his knights as deer before the
hunters. The rout was rapid and complete. The
field presented a fearful scene of panic, confusion,
and slaughter. Some of the vanquished ran for
refuge into Tewkesbury; others betook themselves
for safety to the abbey church; and many, hotly
pursued and scarcely knowing whither they went,
were drowned "at a mill in the meadow fast by
the town."

Somerset, on seeing the ruin his rashness had[Pg 322]
brought on his friends, fled from the scene of carnage.
The duke ought not, perhaps, to have avoided
the destruction to which he had allured so many
brave men. The chief of the Beauforts, however,
had no ambition to die like the great earl whom he
had deserted at Barnet, nor to fall on the field to
which he had challenged his hereditary foe. It is
wonderful, indeed, that a man who had known little
of life save its miseries should have cared to survive
such a defeat; but Somerset, whatever his other
qualities, had none of that spirit which, at Bannockburn,
prompted Argentine to exclaim, "'Tis not my
wont to fly!" At Hexham and at Barnet, Somerset's
principal exploits had consisted of availing himself
of the speed of his horse to escape the foe; and
at Tewkesbury he rushed cravenly from the field,
on which, a few hours earlier, he had boastfully declared
that he would abide such fortune as God
should send. The Prior of St. John, Sir Gervase
Clifton, Sir Thomas Tresham, and a number of
knights and esquires likewise sought safety in flight.

The Prince of Wales had hitherto fought with
courage; and there is some reason to believe that
he fell fighting manfully on the field where so much
blood was shed to vindicate his claims to the crown
of England. Poets, novelists, and historians have,
however, told a different tale, and produced an impression
that, when the heir of Lancaster found himself[Pg 323]
abandoned by Somerset, and perceived the fortune
of the day decidedly adverse to the Red Rose,
he followed the multitude, who, shrinking from the
charge of Edward on his berry-brown steed, and of
Gloucester with his boar's-head crest, fled confusedly
toward the town.

But, however that may have been, all the warriors
of the Red Rose did not fly. Destruction, indeed,
awaited every man who stood his ground; but
even the certainty of death can not daunt those who
are inspired by honor. Knights and nobles, after
fighting with courage, fell with disdainful pride, and
hundreds upon hundreds of the Lancastrians of inferior
rank lost their lives in the cause for which, at
the summons of their chiefs, they had taken up
arms. There fell the Earl of Devon; and John
Beaufort, the brother of Somerset, and, save the
duke, the last male heir of the house of Beaufort;
and Sir John Delves, the chief of a family long settled
at Doddington, in the County Palatine of Chester;
and Sir William Fielding, whose descendants,
in the time of the Stuarts, became Earls of Denbigh;
and Sir Edmund Hampden, one of that ancient
race which had flourished in the eleventh century,
and which, in the sixteenth, produced the renowned
leader of the Long Parliament.

At length, when three thousand Lancastrians had
perished on the field of Tewkesbury, the resistance[Pg 324]
and carnage came to an end; and Edward, having
knighted Warwick's cousin, George Neville, the heir
of Lord Abergavenny, sheathed his bloody sword,
and Gloucester laid aside his lance; and the king
and the duke rode to the abbey church to render
thanks to God for giving them another victory over
their enemies.



[Pg 325]




CHAPTER XXXII.

THE VICTOR AND THE VANQUISHED.


While Edward of York was smiting down his
foes on the field of Tewkesbury, and the blood of
the Lancastrians was flowing like water, a chariot,
guided by attendants whose looks indicated alarm
and dread, might have been observed to leave the
scene of carnage, and pass hurriedly through the
gates of the park. In this chariot was a lady, who
appeared almost unconscious of what was passing,
though it had not been her wont to faint in hours
of difficulty and danger. The lady was Margaret
of Anjou, but with a countenance no longer expressing
those fierce and terrible emotions which,
after Northampton, and Towton, and Hexham, had
urged her to heroic ventures in order to regain for
her husband the crown which her son had been
born to inherit. Pale, ghastly, and rigid       more like
that of a corpse than of a being breathing the breath
of life       was now that face, in which the friends of
the Lancastrian queen had in such seasons often
read, as in a book, resolutions of stern vengeance to
be executed on her foes.

Fortune, indeed, had at length subdued the high[Pg 326]
spirit of Margaret of Anjou, and she made no effort
to resist her fate. When witnessing the battle, and
becoming aware that her worst anticipations were
being realized, the unfortunate queen appeared reckless
of life, and abandoned herself to despair. Alarmed,
however, at the dangers which menaced the vanquished,
Margaret's attendants placed their royal
mistress in a chariot, conveyed her hastily from the
field, and made their way to a small religious house
situated near the left bank of the silver Severn:
there she found the Princess of Wales and several
Lancastrian ladies, who had followed the fortunes
of the Red Rose and shared the perils of their kinsmen.
No need to announce to them that all was
lost. Even if the disastrous intelligence had not
preceded her arrival, they would have read in Margaret's
pale face and corpse-like aspect the ruin of
her hopes and of their own.

The religious house in which the queen found a
temporary resting-place was not one which could
save her from the grasp of the conquering foe. But
so sudden had been the rout of one party, and so
signal the victory of the other, that the vanquished
had no time to think of escaping to a distance. The
abbey church was the point toward which most
of the fugitives directed their course, and within
the walls of that edifice Somerset, the Prior of St.
John, Sir Henry de Roos, Sir Gervase Clifton, Sir[Pg 327]
Thomas Tresham, many knights and esquires, and
a crowd of humble adherents of the Red Rose,
sought refuge from the sword of the conquerors.
Unhappily for the Lancastrians, the church did not
possess the privilege of protecting rebels, and Edward
was in no humor to spare men who had shown
themselves his bitter foes. Without scruple, the
victor-king, on finding they had taken refuge in the
abbey, attempted to enter, sword in hand; but at
this point he found himself face to face with a power
before which kings had often trembled. At the
porch, a priest, bearing the host, interposed between
the conqueror and his destined victims, and protested,
in names which even Edward durst not disregard,
against the sacred precincts being made the
scene of bloodshed. Baffled of his prey, Edward
turned his thoughts to the heir of Lancaster, and
issued a proclamation, promising a reward to any
who should produce the prince, dead or alive, and
stating that in such a case the life of the royal boy
would be spared.

Among the warriors who fought at Tewkesbury
was Sir Richard Croft, a Marchman of Wales.
This knight was husband of a kinswoman of the
Yorkist princes, and had figured as Governor of
Ludlow when Edward, then Earl of March, was
residing during boyhood in that castle with his
brother, the ill-fated Rutland. Passing, after the[Pg 328]
battle of Tewkesbury, between the town and the
field, Croft encountered a youthful warrior, whose
elegance arrested his attention, and whose manner
was like that of one strange to the place. On being
accosted, the youth, in an accent which revealed
a foreign education, acknowledged that he was the
heir of Lancaster; and, on being assured that his
life was in no hazard, he consented to accompany
the stalwart Marchman to the king.

Toward the market-place, a triangular space
where met the three streets that gave to Tewkesbury
the form of the letter Y, Croft conducted his
interesting captive. Tewkesbury has little changed
since that time; but the old Town Hall, which then
stood in the market-place, has disappeared. It
was to a house in the neighborhood of this building,
however, that the king had repaired after the
battle, and there, surrounded by Clarence and Gloucester,
Hastings and Dorset, the captains who had
led his host to victory, sat Edward of York when
Edward of Lancaster was brought into his presence.

[Pg 329]

[Pg 330]THE VICTOR AND THE VANQUISHED.


The king had that morning gained a victory
which put his enemies under his feet, and had
since, perhaps, washed down his cravings for revenge
with draughts of that cup to which he was
certainly too much addicted. It is not difficult to
believe those historians who tell that, under such[Pg 331]
circumstances, satiated with carnage, and anxious
for peace and repose, he was in a frame of mind
the reverse of unfavorable to his captive, nor even
to credit an assertion that the wish of Edward of
York was to treat the heir of the fifth Henry as
that king had treated the last chief of the house of
Mortimer, to convert the prince from a dangerous
rival into a sure friend, and to secure his gratitude
by bestowing upon him the Duchy of Lancaster
and the splendid possessions of John of Gaunt.
To the vanquished prince, therefore, the victor-king
"at first showed no uncourteous countenance." A
minute's conversation, however, dissipated the king's
benevolent intentions, and sealed the brave prince's
fate.

"What brought you to England," asked Edward,
"and how durst you enter into this our realm with
banner displayed?"

"To recover my father's rights," fearlessly answered
the heir of Lancaster; and then asked,
"How darest thou, who art his subject, so presumptuously
display thy colors against thy liege
lord?"

At this reply, which evinced so little of that discretion
which is the better part of valor, Edward's
blood boiled; and, burning with indignation, he savagely
struck the unarmed prince in the mouth with
his gauntlet. Clarence and Gloucester are said to[Pg 332]
have then rushed upon him with their swords, and
the king's servants to have drawn him into another
room and completed the murder. In the house
where, according to tradition, this cruel deed was
perpetrated, marks of blood were long visible on
the oaken floor; and these dark stains were pointed
out as memorials of the cruel murder of the fifth
Henry's grandson, by turns the hope, the hero, and
the victim of the Lancastrian cause.

Having imbrued his hands in the blood of the
only rival whom he could deem formidable, and too
fearfully avenged the murder of Rutland, Edward
appears to have steeled his heart to feelings of mercy,
and to have determined on throwing aside all
scruples in dealing with his foes. It was only decent,
however, to allow Sunday to elapse ere proceeding
with the work of vengeance. That day of
devotion and rest over, the Lancastrians were forcibly
taken from the church. Those of meaner rank
were pardoned; but Somerset, the Prior of St. John,
Sir Henry de Roos, Sir Gervase Clifton, Sir Thomas
Tresham, John Gower, and the other knights and
esquires, were brought to trial. Gloucester and
John Mowbray, the last of the great Dukes of Norfolk,
presided, one as Constable of England, the
other as Earl-marshal; and the trial being, of
course, a mere form, the captives were condemned
to be beheaded.

[Pg 333]

On Tuesday, while the scaffold was being erected
in the market-place of Tewkesbury for the execution
of those who had risked all in her cause, Margaret
of Anjou was discovered in the religious house to
which she had been conveyed from the field on
which her last hopes were wrecked. The Lancastrian
queen was brought to Edward by Sir William
Stanley, still zealous on the Yorkist side, and little
dreaming of the part he was to take at Bosworth in
rendering the Red Rose finally triumphant. Margaret's
life was spared; but her high spirit was
gone, and, on being informed of her son's death, the
unfortunate princess only gave utterance to words
of lamentation and woe. Now that he around
whom all her hopes had clustered was no more,
what could life be to her? what the rival Roses?
what the contentions of York and Lancaster? Her
ambition was buried in the grave of her son, who
had been her consolation and her hope.

Sir John Fortescue was among the Lancastrians
whom the victory of Tewkesbury placed in Edward's
power; and the great lawyer was in some
danger of having to seal with his blood his devotion
to the Red Rose. Fortescue, however, had no longings
for a crown of martyrdom; and Edward, luckily
for his memory, perceived that the house of York
would lose nothing by sparing a foe so venerable
and so learned. It happened that, when in Scotland,[Pg 334]
Fortescue had produced a treatise vindicating
the claims of the house of Lancaster to the English
crown, and the king consented to pardon the ex-chief-justice
if he would write a similar treatise in
favor of the claims of the line of York. The condition
was hard; but that was an age when, to borrow
old Fuller's phrase, it was present drowning
not to swim with the stream; and Fortescue, consenting
to the terms, applied himself to the arduous
task. The difficulty was not insuperable. In his
argument for Lancaster he had relied much on the
fact of Philippa of Clarence having never been acknowledged
by her father. In his argument for
York he showed that Philippa's legitimacy had
been proved beyond all dispute. On the production
of the treatise his pardon was granted; and
the venerable judge retired to spend the remainder
of his days at Ebrington, an estate which he possessed
in Gloucestershire.

About the time that Fortescue received a pardon,
John Morton, who, like the great lawyer, had fought
on Towton Field, and since followed the ruined fortunes
of Lancaster, expressed his readiness to make
peace with the Yorkist king. In this case no difficulty
was interposed. Edward perceived that the
learning and intellect of the "late parson of Blokesworth"
might be of great service to the government.
Morton's attainder was therefore reversed at the[Pg 335]
earliest possible period, and he soon after became
Bishop of Ely.

Meanwhile, on the scaffold erected in the market-place
of Tewkesbury, the Lancastrians were beheaded,
the Prior of St. John appearing on the
mournful occasion in the long black robe and white
cross of his order. No quartering nor dismembering
of the bodies, however, was practiced, nor were
the heads of the vanquished set up in public places,
as after Wakefield and Towton. The bodies of
those who died, whether on the field or the scaffold,
were handed over to their friends or servants,
who interred them where seemed best. Most of
them, including those of the Prince of Wales, Devon,
Somerset, and John Beaufort, were laid in the
abbey church; but the corpse of Wenlock was
removed elsewhere, probably to be buried in the
Wenlock Chapel, which he had built at Luton;
and that of the prior was consigned to the care of
the great fraternity of religious knights at Clerkenwell,
of which he had been the head.

After wreaking his vengeance upon the conquered,
Edward moved northward to complete his triumph,
and forgot for a while the blood he had
shed. Years after, however, when laid on his
death-bed, the memory of those executions appears
to have lain heavy upon his conscience, and he
mournfully expressed the regret which they caused[Pg 336]
him. "Such things, if I had foreseen," said he,
"as I have with more pain than pleasure proved,
by God's Blessed Lady I would never have won
the courtesy of men's knees with the loss of so
many heads."



[Pg 337]




CHAPTER XXXIII.

WARWICK'S VICE-ADMIRAL.


One day in May, 1471, while Edward of York
was at Tewkesbury, while Henry of Windsor was a
captive in the Tower, and while Elizabeth Woodville
and her family were also lodged for security in
the metropolitan fortress       thus at once serving the
purposes of a prison and a palace       a sudden commotion
took place in the capital of England, and
consternation appeared on the face of every citizen.
The alarm was by no means causeless, for never had
the wealth of London looked so pale since threatened
by the Lancastrian army after the battle on Bernard's
Heath.

Among the English patricians who, at the beginning
of the struggle between York and Lancaster,
attached themselves to the fortunes of the White
Rose, was William Neville, son of Ralph, Earl of
Westmoreland, brother of Cicely, Duchess of York,
and uncle of Richard, Earl of Warwick. This Yorkist
warrior derived from the heiress whom he had
married the lordship of Falconbridge; and, after
leading the van at Towton, he was rewarded by
Edward with the earldom of Kent. Dying soon[Pg 338]
after, he was laid at rest, with obsequies befitting
his rank, in the Priory of Gisborough, and his lands
were inherited by his three daughters, one of whom
was the wife of Sir John Conyers.

The Earl of Kent left no legitimate son to inherit
his honors; but he left an illegitimate son, named
Thomas Neville, and known, after the fashion of the
age, as "The Bastard of Falconbridge." The misfortune
of Falconbridge's birth, of course, prevented
him from becoming his father's heir; but, being "a
man of turbulent spirit and formed for action," he
had no idea of passing his life in obscurity. His
relationship to Warwick was not distant; and "The
Stout Earl," duly appreciating the courage and vigor
of his illegitimate kinsman, nominated him vice-admiral,
and appointed him to prevent Edward receiving
any aid from the Continent.

While Warwick lived, Falconbridge appears to
have executed his commission on the narrow seas
with fidelity and decorum. But when Barnet had
been fought, and the vice-admiral had no longer the
fear of the king-maker before his eyes, the narrow
seas saw another sight. Throwing off all restraint,
he took openly to piracy, and, joined by some malcontents
from Calais, went so desperately to work,
that in a marvelously short space of time he made
his name terrible to skippers and traders. Falconbridge
was not, however, content with this kind of[Pg 339]
fame. He had always believed himself destined to
perform some mighty achievement, and he now found
his soul swelling with an irresistible ambition to attempt
the restoration of Lancaster. The peril attending
such an exploit might, indeed, have daunted
the boldest spirit; but the courage of the Bastard
was superlative, and his audacity was equal to his
courage.

The enterprise of Falconbridge was not at first
so utterly desperate as subsequent events made it
appear. The Lancastrians were not yet quite subdued.
Oxford was still free and unsubdued; Pembroke
was in arms on the marches of Wales; and
the men of the north, on whom Edward's hand had
been so heavy, were arming to take revenge on their
tyrant, and liberate from his grasp the woman who,
with her smiles and tears, had in other days tempted
them to do battle in her behalf. If, under these
circumstances, Falconbridge could take Henry out
of prison, proclaim the monk-monarch once more in
London, and send northward the news of a Lancastrian
army being in possession of the capital, he
might change the destiny of England, and enroll his
own name in the annals of fame.

No time was lost in maturing the project. Landing
at Sandwich, Falconbridge was admitted into
Canterbury, and prepared to march upon the metropolis.
His adventure soon began to wear a hopeful[Pg 340]
aspect. Indeed, his success was miraculous;
for, as he made his way through Kent, the army,
which originally consisted of the desperadoes of the
Cinque Ports and the riff-raff of Calais, swelled till
it numbered some seventeen thousand men. Posting
this formidable host on the Surrey side of the
Thames, and, at the same time, causing his ships to
secure the river above St. Katherine's, Falconbridge
demanded access to the city, that he might take
Henry out of the Tower, and then pass onward to
encounter the usurper.

The mayor and aldermen, however, sorely perplexed,
determined to stand by the house of York,
and sent post-haste to inform the king that London
was menaced by land and water, and to implore
him to hasten to the relief of his faithful city. Edward,
who, to awe the northern insurgents, had proceeded
as far as Coventry, forthwith sent fifteen
hundred men to the capital; and, on meeting the
Earl of Northumberland, who came to assure him
of the peace of the north, the king turned his face
southward, and hurried toward London.

Meanwhile the patience of Falconbridge had given
way. Enraged at the refusal of the Londoners to
admit his army, and anxious to gratify the appetite
of his followers for plunder, the Bastard expressed
his intention of passing the Thames with his army
at Kingston, destroying Westminster, and then taking[Pg 341]
revenge on the citizens of London for keeping
him without their gates. Finding, however, that
the wooden bridge at Kingston was broken down,
and all the places of passage guarded, he drew his
forces into St. George's Fields, and from that point
prepared to carry London by assault.

His plan thus formed, Falconbridge commenced
operations with characteristic energy. After carrying
his ordnance from the ships, he planted guns and
stationed archers along the banks of the Thames.
At first considerable execution was done. Many
houses were battered down by the ordnance, and
London experienced much inconvenience from the
flight of arrows; but the citizens soon showed that
this was a game at which two parties could play.
Having brought their artillery to the river-side, and
planted it over against that of their assailants, they
returned the fire with an effect so galling, that the
adherents of the vice-admiral found their position
intolerable, and retreated in confusion from their
guns.

Falconbridge was not the man to despair early
of the enterprise upon which he had ventured. Seeing
his men fall back in dismay, he resolved on prosecuting
the assault in a more direct way, and on going
closely to work with his antagonists. He resolved,
moreover, on making a great attempt at London
Bridge, and, at the same time, ordered his lieutenants       Spicing[Pg 342]
and Quintine       to embark three
thousand men, pass the Thames in ships, and force
Aldgate and Bishopgate. The desperadoes, crossing
the river, acted in obedience to their leader's
orders, and London was at once assailed suddenly
at three separate points. But the Londoners continued
obstinate. Encouraged by the news of Edward's
victory, and incited to valor by the example
of Robert Basset and Ralph Jocelyne, aldermen of
the city, they faced the peril with fortitude, and
offered so desperate a defense, that seven hundred
of the assailants were slain. Repulsed on all points,
and despairing of success, the Bastard was fain to
beat a retreat.

Baffled in his efforts to take the capital by storm,
Falconbridge led his adherents into Kent, and encamped
on Blackheath. His prospects were not
now encouraging; and for three days he remained
in his camp without any new exploits. At the end
of that time he learned that Edward was approaching,
and doubtless felt that the idea of trying conclusions
at the head of a mob with the army that
had conquered at Barnet and Tewkesbury was not
to be entertained. The undisciplined champions of
the Red Rose, indeed, dispersed at the news of Edward's
coming, as pigeons do at the approach of a
hawk; and their adventurous leader, having taken
to his ships, that lay at Blackwall, sailed for Sandwich.

[Pg 343]

On Tuesday, the 21st of May, seventeen days after
Tewkesbury, Edward of York, at the head of thirty
thousand men, entered London as a conqueror, and
in his train to the capital came Margaret of Anjou
as a captive. The broken-hearted queen found herself
committed to the Tower, and condemned as a
prisoner of state to brood, without hope and without
consolation, over irreparable misfortunes and
intolerable woes.

On Wednesday morning       it was that of Ascension
Day       the citizens of London, who some hours
earlier had been thanked for their loyalty to Edward
of York, were informed that Henry of Lancaster
had been found dead in the Tower, and soon
after the corpse was borne bare-faced, on a bier,
through Cheapside to St. Paul's, and there exposed
to the public view. Notwithstanding this ceremony,
rumors were current that the dethroned king had
met with foul play. People naturally supposed
that Falconbridge's attempt to release Henry precipitated
this sad event; and they did not fail to
notice that on the morning when the body was conveyed
to St. Paul's the king and Richard of Gloucester
left London.[13]

[Pg 344]

A resting-place beside his hero-sire, in the Chapel
of St. Edward, might have been allowed to the only
king since the Conquest who had emulated the Confessor's
sanctity. But another edifice than the Abbey
of Westminster was selected as the place of
sepulture; and, on the evening of Ascension Day,
the corpse, having been placed in a barge guarded by
soldiers from Calais, was conveyed up the Thames,
and, during the silence of midnight, committed to
the dust in the Monastery of Chertsey. It was not
at Chertsey, however, that the saintly king was to
rest. When years had passed over, and Richard
had ascended the throne, the mortal remains of
Henry were removed from Chertsey to Windsor,
and interred with much pomp in the south side of
the choir in St. George's Chapel, there to rest, it
was hoped, till that great day, for the coming of
which he had religiously prepared by the devotion
of a life.

After consigning Margaret to the Tower and
Henry to the tomb, Edward led his army from
London, marched to Canterbury, and prepared to
inflict severe punishment on Falconbridge. Meanwhile,
as vice-admiral, Falconbridge had taken possession
of Sandwich, where forty-seven ships obeyed
his command. With this naval force, and the town
fortified in such a way as to withstand a siege, the
Bastard prepared for resistance; but, on learning[Pg 345]
that the royal army had reached Canterbury, his
heart began to fail, and he determined, if possible,
to obtain a pardon. With this object, Falconbridge
dispatched a messenger to Edward; and the
king was, doubtless, glad enough to get so bold a
rebel quietly into his power. At all events, he determined
on deluding the turbulent vice-admiral
with assurances of safety and promises of favor;
and Gloucester was empowered to negotiate a
treaty.

Matters at first went smoothly. The duke rode
to Sandwich to assure his illegitimate cousin of the
king's full forgiveness, and about the 26th of May
Falconbridge made his submission, and promised to
be a faithful subject. Edward then honored him
with knighthood, and confirmed him in the post of
vice-admiral. At the same time, the king granted
a full pardon to the Bastard's adherents; and they,
relying on the royal word, surrendered the town
of Sandwich, with the castle, and the ships that
lay in the port. "But how this composition was
observed," says Baker, "may be imagined, when
Falconbridge, who was comprised in the pardon,
was afterward taken and executed at Southampton.
Spicing and Quintine, the captains that assailed Aldgate
and Bishopgate, and were in Sandwich Castle
at the surrender thereof, were presently beheaded at
Canterbury, and their heads placed on poles in the[Pg 346]
gates; and, by a commission of Oyer and Terminer,
many, both in Essex and Kent, were arraigned and
condemned for this rebellion."

About Michaelmas, Falconbridge expiated his ill-fated
ambition; and the citizens had the satisfaction,
in autumn, of seeing his head exposed to warn malcontents
to beware of Edward of York. "Thomas
Falconbridge, his head," says Paston, "was yesterday
set upon London Bridge, looking Kentward,
and men say that his brother was sore hurt, and
escaped to sanctuary to Beverley." So ended the
ambitious attempt of Warwick's vice-admiral to
play the part of king-maker.



[Pg 347]




CHAPTER XXXIV.

ESCAPE OF THE TUDORS.


When the spirit of the Lancastrians had been
broken on the fields of Barnet and Tewkesbury, and
the violent deaths       if such they were       of the monk-monarch
and his gallant son had left the adherents
of the Red Rose without a prince to rally round, the
house of York seemed to be established forever.

That branch of the Plantagenets which owed its
origin to John of Gaunt was not, indeed, without
an heir. The King of Portugal, the grandson of
Philippa, eldest daughter of John and Blanche of
Lancaster, was the personage with whom that honor
rested; but Alphonso, albeit a knight-errant in manhood's
prime, not being yet turned of forty, and rich
in gold brought from Guinea, was not so utterly indiscreet
as to waste his energy and croisadoes on an
enterprise in which Warwick, the flower of English
patricians and the favorite of the English people,
had so signally failed. Moreover, about this time,
Alphonso was all anxiety to wed Joan, the youthful
daughter of the last King of Castile, and make a
Quixotic attempt, as husband of that princess, to
wrest the Spanish crown from Ferdinand and Isabella.[Pg 348]
Thus occupied with projects of love and
war, the King of Portugal does not appear to have
put forward any claims as heir of John of Gaunt,
nor, perhaps, did the English nation ever seriously
consider his claims.

The extinction of Henry of Bolingbroke's posterity
left the Red Rose party without having at its
head a king whose name might serve as a rallying
cry. But the adherents of the Lancastrian cause,
however dispirited, were not utterly subdued. They
still cherished vague hopes, and pointed to chiefs of
high name; for John de Vere, Earl of Oxford, Henry
Holland, Duke of Exeter, and Jasper Tudor, Earl
of Pembroke, still lived; and while these noblemen       the
first so noble, the second so loyal, and the
third so wary       were free, there was still a prospect
of revenge on the usurper. The fact, however, was,
that the Lancastrian lords were in a situation far
from enviable, and might have been forgiven had
they cherished no aspiration more lofty than that
of getting safely away from the country, and beyond
the reach of Edward's vengeance.

When intelligence reached Jasper Tudor that
Margaret of Anjou and her captains had been totally
routed, far from cherishing any such delusions as
imposed upon the rude intellect of Falconbridge, he
forthwith allowed his forces to disperse, and, making
for the valley of the Wye, took refuge in the strong-hold
of Chepstow.

[Pg 349]

Situated at the mouth of the most beautiful of
English rivers, Chepstow is still an interesting ruin.
At that time it was a magnificent castle, stretching
along a precipitous cliff, consisting of four courts
and a central building, and covering an area of three
acres. To this fortress Jasper, in the day of perplexity,
retired to reflect on the past and prepare for
the future.

While at Chepstow Jasper had a narrow escape.
Edward was naturally most anxious to destroy the
Lancastrians as a party, and eager, therefore, to get
so zealous an adherent of the Red Rose into his
power. With a view of entrapping his old adversary,
he employed Roger Vaughan, one of a clan
who, like the Crofts, were ancient retainers of the
house of Mortimer, to repair to Chepstow. The
contest between the Celt and the Marchman was
brief. Jasper was not to be outwitted. He penetrated
the secret of Vaughan's mission, caused him
to be seized, and, without formality, had his head
struck off.

Having taken this strong measure, and thereby
added to his danger in the event of capture, Jasper
proceeded to Pembroke. At that town the outlawed
earl was exposed to new dangers. Pursued
to Pembroke by a Welsh warrior named Morgan ap
Thomas, he was besieged in the town; but relief
came from a quarter that could hardly have been[Pg 350]
expected. David ap Thomas, who was Morgan's
brother, but attached to the Red Rose, rushing to
Jasper's assistance, succeeded in raising the siege,
and the Welsh earl was freed for the time from
pressing peril. But, having lost all feeling of security,
and every hope of holding out against Edward,
he committed the defense of Pembroke to Sir
John Scudamore, took his brother's son Henry, the
young Earl of Richmond, under his wing, embarked
with the boy at Tenby, and once more as an outlaw
and fugitive sailed for the Continent.

The intention of Jasper and his nephew was to
seek protection at the court of Louis, and they steered
their course toward the coast of France. But
fortune proved unfavorable to this design. Forever
the elements fought against the Lancastrians. Encountering
contrary winds, the Tudors were driven
on the coast of Brittany, and, being compelled to
put into a port belonging to the duke, they could
not avoid paying their respects to that magnate.
The duke received them with courtesy, and treated
them with hospitality, and so far all went pleasantly.
But when the Tudors prepared to pursue their
way to France they were given to understand that
they were not at liberty to proceed.

The two earls were somewhat disconcerted on
comprehending their actual position. They made
the best of circumstances, however; and, indeed, all[Pg 351]
things considered, had not much reason to complain.
The town of Vannes was assigned them as a residence,
and they were treated with the respect deemed
due to their rank. Except being narrowly watched,
their position was not uncomfortable.

Intelligence of the Tudors being at Vannes was
not long confined to Brittany. The news soon
reached both Paris and London; and while the
French king claimed them as friends, the English
king demanded them as rebels and traitors. The
duke, however, firmly adhered to the resolution to
keep them to himself; and Edward was fain to appear
content, and pay a yearly sum for their support.
The duke, on his part, gave assurances that
they should have no opportunity of causing disturbance
to the English government.

When a few years passed over, circumstances had
rendered young Henry Tudor a more important
personage, and Edward made a great effort to obtain
their extradition. To accomplish this object,
he sent an embassy to Brittany to invite Henry to
England, promising him the hand of the Princess
Elizabeth. The Duke of Brittany was induced to
consent, and Henry repaired to St. Malo to embark.
But Peter de Landois, the duke's chief minister,
who at that time pretended a high regard for the
Tudors, declared that Edward's offer was a snare,
and pointed out the impolicy of crediting Edward's[Pg 352]
profession of friendship. The duke was convinced;
and Richmond's embarkation having been delayed
by a fever, the result of anxiety, he returned to
Vannes.

And at Vannes, as guest or captive of Brittany       he
hardly knew which       Henry Tudor was destined
to remain, till one day the Bishop of Ely and the
Duke of Buckingham, conspiring in Brecknock Castle,
nominated him       a man described by Comines as
"without power, without money, without hereditary
right, and without any reputation"       as a candidate
for the proudest of European thrones.



[Pg 353]




CHAPTER XXXV.

ADVENTURES OF JOHN DE VERE.


One autumn day, about six months after the fall
of Warwick and Montagu, a little fleet approached
the coast of Cornwall, and anchored in the green
waters of Mount's Bay. The monks and fighting
men who tenanted the fortified monastery that
crowned the summit of St. Michael's Mount might
have deemed the appearance of the ships slightly
suspicious; but the aspect and attire of those who
landed from their decks forbade uncharitable surmises.
Indeed, they were in the garb of pilgrims,
and represented themselves as men of rank, who, at
the suggestion of their confessors, had come from
remote parts of the kingdom to perform vows, make
orisons, and offer oblations at the shrine of St.
Michael.

It was the last day of September       the festival of
St. Keyne, a virgin princess of rare sanctity, who
had, in the fifth century, for pious purposes, visited
the Mount; and, on such an occasion, the monks
were not likely to be in any very skeptical mood.
Proud, in all probability, of their saint's reputation,
and not doubting his power to inspire zeal, they[Pg 354]
opened their gates and admitted the pilgrims. No
sooner were they admitted, however, than the scene
changed. Each man, throwing aside his pilgrim's
habit, stood before the astonished monks a warrior
in mail, with a dagger in his girdle, a sword by his
side, and in his eye the determination to use those
weapons in the event of resistance. At the head of
this band was a man of thirty or thereabouts, who
announced that he was John De Vere, Earl of Oxford,
and that he had come to take possession of St.
Michael's Mount in the name of Lancaster.

Between his escape from Barnet and his arrival
at St. Michael's Mount the chief of the De Veres had
passed through some remarkable adventures. When
Oxford, bewildered by the consequences of his silver
star being mistaken for Edward's sun, and thrown
off his guard by the shouts of "Treason!" rode
through the mist and fled from the field, he directed
his course northward with the intention of seeking
refuge in Scotland; but, after riding some distance,
and taking time to reflect, the earl came to the conclusion
that the journey was too long to be accomplished
with safety, and, turning aside, he rode, in
the company of Lord Beaumont, toward the Welsh
Marches, with the hope of joining Jasper Tudor.
Whether or not he reached Wales is not quite clear;
but it appears from a letter written in April to his
countess, Warwick's sister, that, after Queen Margaret[Pg 355]
had landed and her friends had resolved on
another campaign, Oxford recovered the spirit he
had displayed at Coventry, and indulged in the
hope of a Lancastrian triumph.

"Right reverend and worshipful lady," writes the
earl to his countess, "I recommend me to you, letting
you weet that I am in great heaviness at the
making of this letter; but, thanked be God, I am
escaped myself, and suddenly departed from my men;
for I understand my chaplain would have betrayed
me....

"Ye shall give credence to the bringer of this
letter, and I beseech you to reward him to his costs;
for I am not in power at the making of this letter
to give him but as I was put in trust by favor of
strange people. Also, ye shall send me, in all
haste, all the ready money ye can make, and as
many of my men as can come well horsed, and that
they come in divers parcels. Also, that my best
horses be sent with my steel saddles, and bid the
yeoman of the horse cover them with leather.

"Also, ye shall send to my mother and let her
weet of this letter, and pray her of her blessing, and
bid her send me my casket, by this token, that she
hath the key thereof, but it is broken. And ye shall
send to the Prior of Thetford, and bid him send me
the sum of gold that he said I should have; also say
to him, by this token, that I showed him the first
Privy Seal....

[Pg 356]

"Also, ye shall be of good cheer, and take no
thought; for I shall bring my purpose about now,
by the grace of God, who have you in His keeping."

Oxford soon learned the truth of the homely
proverb that there is much between the cup and
the lip; and when Tewkesbury extinguished his
hopes of victory, the earl, attended by Lord Beaumont,
betook himself to France. His reception in
that country not being such as to tempt a prolonged
residence, he fitted out a fleet, and for a while made
the ocean his home. Indeed, it would seem that,
when exiled from his kindred and his castles, the
heir of the De Veres reverted to the habits of his
Scandinavian ancestors, and that, during the summer
of 1471, the thirteenth of the proud earls of
Oxford roved the narrow seas as a pirate. About
the close of September, however, Oxford, having, in
the words of Speede, "gotten stores of provisions by
the strong hand at sea," landed in Cornwall; and
with a body of men, whom some chroniclers represent
as well-nigh four hundred, and others as less
than a sixth of that number, appeared suddenly at
St. Michael's Mount.

The monks of St. Michael and the soldiers who
garrisoned the Mount were in no condition to resist
a body of men so determined. They therefore yielded
without a struggle; and Oxford set himself to[Pg 357]
the task of repairing the fortifications, getting men
and ammunition to defend the Mount in the event
of a siege, and procuring provisions to subsist them
in case of the operations being prolonged. Men and
supplies were both forthcoming, for the earl happened
to be grandson of an heiress of Sir Richard
Sergeaux of Colquite, and their regard for the memory
of that lady made the Cornishmen most eager
to prove their devotion to his service. When, therefore,
Oxford or his men descended into the villages
adjacent to the Mount, they were received with enthusiasm,
and, in the words of the chronicler, "had
good cheer of the inhabitants."

Oxford's enterprise seemed to have prospered;
but the period was the reverse of favorable for a
Lancastrian lord being left in undisturbed possession
of a strong-hold. No sooner did Edward hear of
the exploit, than he issued a proclamation branding
De Vere and his adherents as traitors; and, at the
same time, he ordered Sir John Arundel, Sheriff of
Cornwall, to retake St. Michael's Mount without
delay. Arundel raised an army in the locality, advanced
to the Mount, and sent a trumpeter to summon
Oxford to surrender to the king's mercy, and
thus save the effusion of Christian blood. The earl
was uninfluenced by the ceremony. He resolutely
refused to listen to the conditions. "Rather than
yield on such terms," said he, "I and those with me
will lose our lives."

[Pg 358]

The sheriff, seeing no hope of a capitulation, proceeded
to storm the Mount. Oxford, however, far
from being daunted, defended the strong-hold with
such energy that, after a struggle, the besiegers were
beaten at all points and repulsed with loss. Nor
was this the worst; for the garrison, sallying from
the outer gate, pursued the assailants down to the
sands. There Arundel was slain with many of his
soldiers; and the survivors       most of whom were
newly levied       fled in dismay.[14]

Arundel was buried in the Church of the Mount;
and Edward, on hearing of the sheriff's death, appointed
a gentleman named Fortescue as successor
in the office. Having been ordered to prosecute the
siege, Fortescue commenced operations. But the
new sheriff was little more successful than his predecessor.
Moreover, the Mount, which was connected
with the main land by an isthmus, dry at
low water, but at other times overflowed, gained the
reputation of being impregnable; and the king, who
ascribed the want of success to the want of loyal
zeal, and described Cornwall as "the back door of[Pg 359]
rebellion," instructed Fortescue to hold a parley
with Oxford in order to ascertain the earl's desires
and expectations.

Fortescue acted according to his instructions, and
demanded on what conditions the garrison would
surrender.

"If," said the earl, "the king will grant myself
and my adherents our lives, our liberties, and our
estates, then we will yield."

"And otherwise?" said the sheriff.

"Why, in that event," exclaimed Oxford, with
calm desperation, "we will fight it out to the last
man."

The earl's answer was conveyed to the king; and
on Edward's assuring the garrison of a free pardon,
under the great seal of England, Oxford surrendered
St. Michael's Mount. Indeed, he had been extremely
perplexed; for Fortescue, it appears, had already
opened communications with the garrison, and conveyed
them such promises on the king's part that
Oxford was under the necessity of surrendering himself
to avoid the humiliation of being delivered by
his own men into the hands of the besiegers. This
was all the more provoking that he had sufficient
provisions to last till midsummer; but there was
no resisting fate, and, about the middle of February,
Fortescue entered the Mount.

Oxford, having been carried to London with two[Pg 360]
of his brothers and Lord Beaumont, was tried and
attainted; and, notwithstanding the promise of pardon,
the fate of the chief of the De Veres now appeared
to be sealed. Fortunately for the Lancastrian
earl, Edward's conscience was at that time
troubled with some qualms, and his heart daunted
by some signs which he regarded as ominous of evil.
Not being in a savage humor, he shrunk from having
more De Vere blood on his hands, and the earl
escaped execution. However, he was sent captive
to Picardy.

When Oxford was sent to a foreign prison, his
youthful countess was left in poverty. As the sister
of Warwick and the wife of Oxford, the noble
lady was regarded by Edward with peculiar aversion;
and, both as sister and wife, she returned the
king's antipathy with interest. Thus it happened
that, notwithstanding the near relationship in which
she stood to the house of York, no provision out of
her husband's revenues was made for her maintenance
during his incarceration. The countess had
all the Neville pride and determination. Cast down
from patrician grandeur, and expelled from Castle
Hedlingham and other feudal seats, where she had
maintained state as the wife of England's proudest
Norman earl, she made a noble effort to earn daily
bread, and contrived to make a living by the exercise
of her skill in needle-work. The struggle to[Pg 361]
keep the wolf from the door was doubtless hard to
the daughter of Salisbury and the spouse of Oxford;
but, from being compelled to rely on her industry,
Margaret Neville escaped the irksome necessity of
suppressing the indignation she felt against her husband's
foes, and she retained the privilege of denouncing
the king, whom her imagination painted as
the falsest of tyrants.

Meanwhile, Oxford was, in defiance of the king's
promise, conveyed to Hammes, and committed as a
prisoner to the Castle. The earl was not a man to
relish the idea of incarceration, and he resolved on
taking an unceremonious leave of his jailers. With
this view, he leaped from the walls into the ditch,
and endeavored to escape. The vigilance of his
warders, however, rendered this attempt futile, and
John de Vere was conveyed back to the Castle, a
prisoner without prospect of release.



[Pg 362]




CHAPTER XXXVI.

A DUKE IN RAGS.


Among the Lancastrian chiefs who survived the
two fields on which the Red Rose was trodden under
the hoofs of King Edward's charger, none was
destined to a more wretched fate than the conqueror's
own brother-in-law, Henry, Duke of Exeter.
The career of this chief of the family of Holland,
from his cradle to his grave, forms a most melancholy
chapter in the annals of the period.

The Hollands were somewhat inferior in origin
to most of the great barons who fought in the Wars
of the Roses. The founder of the house was a poor
knight, who, from being secretary to an Earl of
Lancaster, rose to some post of importance. His
grandson, happening to hold the office of steward
of the household to an Earl of Salisbury, contrived
to espouse Joan Plantagenet, daughter of the Earl
of Kent; and when that lady, known as "The Fair
Maid of Kent," after figuring as a widow, became
wife of "The Black Prince," the fortunes of the
Hollands rose rapidly. One flourished as Earl of
Kent; another was created Duke of Surrey; and
a third, having been gifted with the earldom of[Pg 363]
Huntingdon, became Duke of Exeter and husband
of Elizabeth of Lancaster, John of Gaunt's second
daughter.

Notwithstanding his Lancastrian alliance, the first
Duke of Exeter remained faithful to Richard in
1399, and, consequently, lost his head soon after
that sovereign's deposition. The son of the decapitated
nobleman, however, being nephew of the new
king, was soon received into favor by Henry of Lancaster,
and appointed Constable of the Tower and
Lord High Admiral of England. At an early age
he married a daughter of Edmund, Earl Stafford;
and on the 27th of June, 1430, their only son was
born in the Tower of London. On the same day
he was carried to Cold Harbor in the arms of the
Countess Marshal, who conveyed him in a barge to
Westminster, where, in St. Stephen's Chapel, he was
baptized by the name of Henry.

Fortune seemed to smile on the heir of the Hollands.
Could the future have been foreseen, however,
no young peasant, laboring in the fields and
struggling out of serfdom, would have envied the
infant destined to a career so miserable and a catastrophe
so melancholy. The life of Henry Holland
opened brightly enough. At the age of seventeen
he succeeded his father as third Duke of Exeter
and Lord High Admiral of England, and espoused
Anne Plantagenet, eldest daughter of the Duke of[Pg 364]
York; and, at the time when the Roses were plucked,
he appears to have favored the Yorkist cause.
A change, however, came over his fortunes and his
political sentiments.

Exeter had, in fact, chosen his party without due
consideration, and ere long he saw reason to change
sides. Indeed, his place in Parliaments and councils
must have reminded the young duke that, through
his grandmother, he was of the blood of Lancaster;
and to a man of his rank flatterers would hardly be
wanting to suggest the probability of the course of
events bringing the regal sceptre to his hand. On
arriving at years of discretion, Exeter changed the
pale for the purple rose, and, after the first battle of
St. Albans, he was under the necessity of flying to
the sanctuary of Westminster. From that place of
security he was taken on some pretext, and sent as a
prisoner to Pontefract Castle.

When the political wind changed, Exeter recovered
his liberty; and, as time passed over, he fought
for Margaret of Anjou in the battles of Wakefield
and Towton. After the rout of the Red Rose army
on Palm Sunday, 1461, he fled with Henry into
Scotland; but in the autumn of that year he was
tempting fortune in Wales, and, in company with
Jasper Tudor, stood embattled at Tutehill, near
Carnarvon, against King Edward's forces. The
Yorkists proving victorious, Exeter and his comrade[Pg 365]
in arms were fain to make for the mountains,
leaving the Welsh Lancastrians no resource but to
submit.

Exeter's biography now becomes obscure. The
unfortunate duke can be traced, however, lurking
on the Scottish frontier, fighting at Hexham, flying
to a Northumbrian village, finding Margaret of Anjou
in the outlaw's cave, accompanying the Lancastrian
queen into exile, and wandering as a broken man on
the Continent, while his duchess, in no degree inclined
to share such fortunes, enjoyed the estate of
her banished lord, lived at her brother's court, kept
well with Elizabeth Woodville, and ministered to
that lady's maternal ambition by pledging the hand
of Exeter's heiress to the young Marquis of Dorset.
When, however, Warwick chased Edward of York
from the kingdom, Exeter appeared once more in
England, and figured as one of the Lancastrian
leaders at Barnet.

The disgrace of abandoning "The Stout Earl"
on the field where he was laid low, Exeter did not
share. As early as seven in the morning of that
Easter Sunday he was struck by an arrow, and left
for dead on the field. After remaining for nine
hours, he was discovered still alive, and carried to
the house of one of his servants named Ruthland.
A surgeon having been found to dress the duke's
wound, he was in such a degree restored as to be
conveyed to the sanctuary of Westminster.

[Pg 366]

At this point mystery again settles over Exeter's
history. It appears, however, that the ill-fated duke
escaped to the Continent, and that the duchess seized
the opportunity to break the last link that bound her
to a husband so unfortunate. In November, 1472,
nearly two years after the battle of Barnet, the
Plantagenet lady, at her own suit, procured a divorce,
and soon after married Sir Thomas St. Leger,
Knight of the Body to King Edward. The duchess
survived this event for three years. According to
Sandford, she breathed her last in 1475; and "St.
Leger surviving her," says Dugdale, "in 21 Edward
IV. founded a perpetual chantry of two priests to
celebrate divine service daily within the Chapel
of St. George in Windsor Castle." Exeter's only
daughter, who had been betrothed to the Marquis
of Dorset, died before her mother, and Elizabeth
Woodville secured the heiress of Bonville as bride
for her son.

Meanwhile the plight of Exeter became deplorable,
and in Flanders he was reduced to absolute
beggary. Comines relates that, on one occasion, he
saw the impoverished magnate running after the
Duke of Burgundy, and begging bread for God's
sake. In the hapless mendicant, in rags and misery,
Burgundy did not recognize the once proud
chief of the house of Holland       his cousin by blood
and his brother-in-law by marriage. On being afterward[Pg 367]
informed, however, that the ragged mendicant
was the banished Duke of Exeter, great-grandson
of John of Gaunt, the king of Portugal's kinsman
and his own, and formerly Lord High Admiral
of England, owner of broad baronies, and husband
of Anne Plantagenet, Charles the Rash was touched,
and induced to bestow on Exeter a pension to save
him from farther degradation.

Dugdale presumes that this scene occurred "after
Barnet Field;" and, if so, Burgundy's bounty was
not long enjoyed by the unfortunate recipient.
Sometime in 1474 Exeter's earthly troubles ended.
His body was found floating in the sea between
Dover and Calais, but how he came by his death
was never ascertained.

"In this year," says Fabyan, "was the Duke of
Exeter found dead in the sea, between Dover and
Calais, but how he was drowned the certainty is not
known."



[Pg 368]




CHAPTER XXXVII.

LOUIS DE BRUGES AT WINDSOR.


In the autumn of 1472, while Oxford was being
secured in the Castle of Hammes, and Edward was
striving to get Pembroke and Richmond into his
power, a guest, whom the king delighted to honor,
appeared in England. This was Louis de Bruges,
who had proved so true a friend in the hour of
need; and right glad was Edward of York to welcome
the Lord of Grauthuse to the regal castle
which still stands, in the nineteenth century, a monument
of the Plantagenets' pride in peace and prowess
in war.

An account of the visit of the Burgundian nobleman,
written at the time, has fortunately been preserved;
and, as has been remarked, "far more luxurious
and more splendid than might be deemed by
those who read but the general histories of that
sanguinary time, or the inventories of furniture in
the houses even of the great barons, was the accommodation
which Edward afforded to his guests."

On reaching Windsor, where, by-the-by, Margaret
of Anjou was then a prisoner of state, Louis de
Bruges was received by Lord Hastings, who, as the[Pg 369]
king's chamberlain, led the noble guest to apartments
in the far side of the quadrangle of the castle,
which were richly hung with arras of cloth of gold.
Edward received Louis with every demonstration of
affection, and presented him to his spouse; and Elizabeth
Woodville was, of course, all courtesy to her
husband's preserver. After the ceremony of reception
was over, the king signified that Hastings should
conduct the Lord of Grauthuse to his chamber,
where supper was ready; and Louis found that every
preparation had been made for entertaining him
luxuriously.

The apartments appropriated to the Burgundian
are described as having been fitted up in a way
which must have impressed the eye even of a man
accustomed to the magnificence of Dijon. The walls
were hung with white silk and linen cloth, and the
floor covered with rich carpets. The bed was of
down, the sheets were of Rennes cloth, and the
counterpane, the tester, and the ceiler were of cloth
of gold and furred with ermine. In the second
chamber was another state bed, and a couch with
hangings like a tent. In the third, covered with
white cloth, was a bath, which in that age was in
daily use.

After partaking of supper in the apartments dedicated
to his service, Louis was conducted to the
queen's withdrawing room, where he found Elizabeth[Pg 370]
and her ladies amusing themselves with different
games; some playing at marteaux with balls
like marbles, and others at closheys, or nine-pins,
made of ivory.

Next day, after matins, Edward took his guest to
the Chapel of St. George, where they heard mass
most melodiously sung. When mass had been performed,
the king presented his guest with a cup of
gold, garnished with pearl, in the middle of which
was a large piece of unicorn's horn, and on the cover
a great sapphire. Then the king led Louis to the
quadrangle of the castle, and there the Prince of
Wales, still in his second year, appeared, to bid the
Lord of Grauthuse welcome to England. Having
introduced his heir to the Burgundian lord, Edward
conducted his guest into the little park, where they
had much sport. The king made Louis ride his
own horse; and of the animal, which is described
as "a right fair hobby," he graciously made a present
to his guest.

That day the king dined at the lodge in Windsor
Park; and, the dinner over, he showed Louis his
gardens and vineyard of pleasure. The queen ordered
the evening banquet in her own apartments;
and, when supper was over, the Princess Elizabeth
danced with the Duke of Buckingham. Never did
guest receive more flattering attentions than Louis.
The king and courtiers did not take their leave of[Pg 371]
him for the night till they had escorted him to his
apartments; and soon after, when he had been in
his bath and was preparing to betake himself to repose,
there were sent him by the queen's orders
"green ginger, and divers sirups, and hippocras."
Next morning Louis breakfasted with the king,
and then, leaving Windsor, returned to Westminster.

At Westminster new honors awaited the Lord of
Grauthuse. On St. Edward's Day       exactly nineteen
years after the birth of the ill-fated Edward of
Lancaster       the king created the Burgundian nobleman
Earl of Winchester, and, with many complimentary
phrases, gave him the arms of the family
of De Quency, which had enjoyed that earldom at
the time of the Barons' Wars. After having been
granted a more substantial mark of Edward's gratitude
in the shape of a pension, Louis de Bruges took
his leave and returned to his own country.



[Pg 372]




CHAPTER XXXVIII.

THE TREATY OF PICQUIGNY.


When Edward's victories on Gladsmuir Heath
and the banks of the Severn had rendered the Lancastrians
in England utterly incapable of making
head against the house of York, the martial king
naturally turned his thoughts to Continental triumphs,
and prepared to avenge himself on Louis of
France for the encouragement which that monarch
had openly and secretly given to the adherents of
the Red Rose.

Apart from the friendship shown by the crafty
king to Warwick and Lancaster, Edward had a
strong reason for making war on Louis. It was
well known that Louis had not only sneered at his
royalty, but questioned his legitimacy, calling him
"the son of the archer," and keeping alive a story
which some envious Lancastrians had invented about
an intrigue of the Duchess of York, the proudest of
English matrons, with Blackburn of Middleham.
Besides, Edward was not insensible to the glory and
popularity to be acquired by emulating the martial
deeds of his ancestors on Continental soil. Accordingly,
in the year 1475, after concluding an alliance[Pg 373]
offensive and defensive with the Duke of Burgundy,
and receiving promises of co-operation from the Constable
St. Pol, Edward dispatched Garter-King-at-Arms
to Louis, demanding the immediate surrender
of the kingdom of France.

However startled Louis might be at the message,
he did not lose his presence of mind. After reading
Edward's letter and reflecting, he sent for the Garter-King,
brought all his statecraft into play, expressed
his high respect for the English king, deplored that
such a prince should be deluded by so treacherous
an ally as Burgundy, and persuaded the herald to
urge his master to settle the matter amicably.
Moreover, he promised Garter a thousand crowns
when peace should be concluded; and, meanwhile,
presented him with three hundred crowns. Garter-King-at-Arms
was touched with the munificence of
Louis, and promised his good offices; nay, more,
significantly advised the King of France to open
negotiations with the English ministers, whom he
knew to be averse to a war.

Meanwhile, Edward had set himself to the task
of providing money and men for the expedition he
meditated; and as the project of a war with France
was sure to make Parliament open the purse of the
nation, a considerable sum was voted. To Edward,
however, the amount appeared insufficient for his
purpose, and he resolved upon a system of exaction[Pg 374]
practiced in time of Richard the Second, and known
as "a benevolence." But money paid in this way
was supposed to be a voluntary gift, and not likely
to come in large sums unless asked for. Edward,
therefore, sent for the wealthiest citizens of London,
talked to them frankly, and pressed them to contribute
liberally; and he besides secured the influence
of the city dames, who exerted themselves to
the utmost on his behalf. A story is told of a
widow, who was not fond of parting with money,
bringing twenty pounds. "By God's Blessed Lady,"
said Edward, who was present, "you shall have a
king's kiss for that money," and suited the action
to the word. "Sire," said she, delighted with this
familiarity, "the honor is worth more money than
I have given:" and the widow doubled her contribution.

Large sums having been obtained, a gallant army
was soon raised. In fact, the sons of the men of
Agincourt did not relish the idea of beating swords
into plowshares; and to the royal standard came
nearly twenty thousand men, headed by the Dukes
of Clarence and Gloucester, the Marquis of Dorset,
the Earl of Northumberland, Lord Stanley, Lord
Hastings, and other men of rank. With these,
and attended by Lord-chancellor Rotheram and the
Bishop of Ely, Edward sailed from Sandwich, and,
toward the close of June, landed at Calais, which he[Pg 375]
had last visited under the protection of Warwick,
between their flight from Ludlow and their victory
at Northampton.

High hopes were at first entertained by the invaders;
but it soon became apparent that they were
not destined to add a Cressy or an Agincourt to
England's list of victories. At the very beginning,
their enterprise was ruined by the constable's insincerity
and Burgundy's rashness. The former failed
to open the gates as he had promised; and the latter,
instead of joining Edward with a large army,
exhausted his strength before Neuss in a battle with
the Swiss.

Louis began to breathe freely; and while the English
army lay inactive at Peronne, French gold circulated
freely among the leaders. A general desire
for peace was, of course, the result; and, ere long,
Edward caught the infection. French embassadors
soon appeared, and offered to pay any thing in reason.
A sum of seventy-five thousand crowns down,
an annuity of fifty thousand crowns, and the dauphin
as a husband for his eldest daughter       such
were the terms submitted on the part of Louis for
the acceptance of the English king. Edward could
not resist such offers; and, after negotiations had
gone on for some time, the kings agreed to a conference.

Picquigny, three leagues from Amiens, on the[Pg 376]
road from Calais to Paris, was selected as the scene,
and the 29th of August appointed as the time for
this memorable interview. Every precaution was
taken to prevent mischief; and on the middle of the
bridge which spanned the Somme, at Picquigny,
were erected two sheds. These fronted each other,
but were divided from top to bottom by a trellis of
wood-work. The space between the gratings was
no wider than to admit a man's arm; and the English
king was to occupy one side of the barricade,
while the French king occupied the other.

It appears that Richard of Gloucester considered
the terms of treaty degrading, and declined to appear
at the conference. Nevertheless, on the appointed
morning, Edward, attended by Clarence, Northumberland,
Hastings, and others, proceeded to the
Bridge of Picquigny, and approached the grating.
On the other side, Louis had already arrived, with
the Duke of Bourbon, the Cardinal Bourbon, about
ten other persons of the highest rank in France,
and Philip de Comines, who had recently exchanged
the service of Burgundy for that of Louis.

One glance at Edward as he advanced along the
causeway, with his tall, graceful form arrayed in
cloth of gold, and wearing on his regal head a velvet
cap with a large fleur de lis formed of precious
stones, must have convinced so acute an observer as
Louis that the story about the archer of Middleham[Pg 377]
was an invention of the enemy; and as the King of
England took off his cap, and bowed with grace, the
French monarch, who had been leaning against the
barrier, made a respectful obeisance, and exclaimed,
"Cousin, you are right welcome. There is no person
living I have been so ambitious of seeing." Edward,
in good French, returned the compliment; and
the two kings proceeded to business.

Notwithstanding a heavy fall of rain, which "came
on to the great vexation of the French lords, who
had dressed themselves and their horses in their
richest habiliments, in honor of King Edward," the
conference proved interesting. The Bishop of Ely,
in a set harangue, quoted a prophecy of Merlin foreshadowing
the august meeting; and a missal and
crucifix having been produced, the kings, each placing
one hand on the book and another on the crucifix,
swore to observe religiously the terms of the
treaty.

The solemn ceremony of swearing over, Louis became
jocose, assured Edward he should be happy to
see him in Paris, and promised to assign him, as
confessor, the Cardinal Bourbon, who would, doubtless,
readily grant absolution for any love affairs.
Edward seemed to relish the prospect; and, knowing
the cardinal's morals to be lax as his own, took
the opportunity of displaying his wit in reply. After
this the lords were sent to a little distance; and[Pg 378]
the kings, having spoken some words in private,
shook hands through the grating, and parted       Louis
riding to Amiens, and Edward to the English camp.

No sooner had Louis left the bridge of Picquigny
than he repented of the invitation he had given Edward
to visit the French capital. "Certes," said
the crafty monarch to Comines, as they rode toward
Amiens, "our brother of England is a fine
king, and a warm admirer of the ladies. At Paris
he might chance to find some dame so much to his
taste as to tempt him to return. His predecessors
have been too often both in Paris and Normandy
already, and I have no great affection for his company
on this side of the Channel."

At Amiens, on the same evening, when Louis was
sitting down to supper, an amusing scene occurred.
Sir John Howard, now a baron, and Sir John Cheyney,
Edward's Master of the Horse, had been appointed
to accompany Louis to Paris; and Howard,
whose vanity made him, as usual, ridiculous, whispered
to the French king that it would go hard but
he would persuade Edward to come to Paris a while
and be merry. Louis allowed this to pass without
returning any direct answer; but afterward he took
occasion to say that the war with Burgundy would
render his presence absolutely necessary in another
part of France.

But, whatever his apprehensions, Louis was not[Pg 379]
doomed to have his formidable contemporary as a
foe or a guest on the banks of the Seine. Edward,
doubtless delighted with the prospect of indulging in
hunting, carousing, and love-making at Shene or
Windsor, recalled, without delay, his soldiers from
Peronne, Abbeville, and other places, and, escorted
by the Bishop of Evreux, marched back to Calais.
Thence he embarked for England, but not without
being unpleasantly reminded that he hardly came
off with royal honors. In fact, the Constable of
St. Pol, apparently enraged that events had taken
such a turn as to profit him nothing, wrote Edward
a furious letter, calling him "a coward, a pitiful
and poor sovereign, for having made a treaty with a
king who would not keep one of his promises."[15]

The Plantagenet sent St. Pol's epistle to the King
of France, and digested the affront; and while Louis,
who had already been suspected of poisoning his
brother, Charles de Valois, got rid of another enemy
by beheading the constable, Edward returned to
England to expend the money he had received as a
bribe on those pleasures destined to destroy his
health and obscure his intellect. Nor did his nobles
come home empty-handed. Dorset, Hastings, and[Pg 380]
Howard, Sir John Cheyney and Sir Thomas St.
Leger, had become pensioners of the French king;
and the people were left to complain that the expedition
for which they had paid so dearly had ended
in infamy. Perhaps, under such circumstances, they
did drop a tear over the grave of "The Stout Earl,"
who, had he been alive, would not have stood quietly
by while a king of England extracted taxes from
English subjects to commence an unnecessary war,
and took bribes from a French monarch to conclude
a humiliating peace.



[Pg 381]




CHAPTER XXXIX.

A DOMESTIC TRAGEDY.


At the opening of the year 1477, Charles the
Rash, Duke of Burgundy, fell at Nanci, before the
two-handed swords of the Swiss mountaineers, leaving,
by his first wife, Isabel of Bourbon, a daughter,
Mary, the heiress of his dominions. About the same
time, George, Duke of Clarence, and Anthony Woodville,
Earl Rivers, happened to become widowers.
The duke and the earl, in other days rivals for the
hand of the heiress of Lord Scales, immediately entered
the arena as candidates for that of Mary of
Burgundy, and their rivalry produced one of the
darkest domestic tragedies recorded in the Plantagenet
annals.

Clarence appears to have been the first to urge
his claims. Almost ere the dust had time to gather
on the coffin of his departed wife in the Abbey of
Tewkesbury, the bereaved husband of Isabel Neville
applied to his sister, the widow of Burgundy, to forward
his suit with her step-daughter. The widowed
duchess was the reverse of unfavorable to a matrimonial
project so likely to advance the fortunes of
her family, and the heart of Clarence for a moment[Pg 382]
glowed with anticipations of a great matrimonial
success.

But the hopes which Clarence cherished of a
marriage with the heiress of Burgundy were rudely
dispelled. The duke, whose shallow brain was
muddled with Malmsey, soon found that he was no
match for veteran courtiers. Experienced intriguers,
the Woodvilles were prompt in their measures
to defeat any project that jarred with their interests;
and Elizabeth instilled into her husband's mind such
suspicions as to Clarence's intentions, that Edward
not only refused to hear of an alliance that "might
enable Clarence to employ the power of Burgundy
to win the crown," but even let down his dignity so
far as to propose a marriage between Anthony, Earl
Rivers, and the daughter of Charles the Rash. The
court of Burgundy, treating the proposal with the
disdain it deserved, gave the heiress to the Emperor
Maximilian; and the Woodvilles, finding their presumption
checked, and resolved to console themselves
by making Clarence a victim, bent all their energies
to effect his ruin.

Circumstances were unfavorable to Clarence; for,
since the duke's confederacy with Warwick, no love
had existed between him and the king. Edward
deemed that he owed his brother an injury; and
that, at least, was a kind of debt which Edward of
York was never sorry to have an opportunity of[Pg 383]
paying. The king's dislike was judiciously humored
by the queen's kindred; and a prophecy, that
the crown should be seized and the royal children
murdered by one, the first letter of whose name was
G, took possession of his imagination. A fair excuse
only was wanting to get rid of Clarence, and a
pretext was ere long found.

Among the Anglo-Norman families who during
the fifteenth century maintained territorial state in
that county which had come with an heiress of the
Beauchamps to Richard Neville, and with the eldest
daughter of the king-maker to the royal duke by
whom he was betrayed, few were of higher consideration
than the Burdets. One of the Burdets had
accompanied the Conqueror to England; another
had sat as member for Warwickshire in the Parliament
of the second Edward; and a third, Sir
Nicholas, had fought with high distinction in the
wars carried on by the Duke of York in France.
Falling at Pontoise on that day when King Charles
of France stormed the town, Nicholas left a son,
Thomas, who resided at Arrow, the seat of his
family, and held an office in Clarence's household.

Burdet had figured as a Yorkist and fought for
the White Rose. Being a follower of Clarence,
however, he was regarded with some degree of suspicion;
and, having domestic troubles, his temper
was probably too much the worse for the wear to[Pg 384]
admit of his being suspected without manifesting
impatience. An accident, according to chroniclers,
occurred, which exasperated him to language so indiscreet
as to cause his own death and that of his
patron.

Burdet had, among the deer in his park at Arrow,
a white buck, of which he was exceedingly proud.
This buck was destined to be the cause of much
mischief; for one day, when Burdet was from home,
the king, making a progress through Warwickshire,
went to Arrow, and entered the park to divert himself
with hunting. Unfortunately, Edward killed
the favorite buck of all others; and Burdet, being
informed on his return of what had happened, was
enraged beyond measure. Indeed, it was said that
the worthy squire, regarding the whole affair as a
premeditated insult, lost his patience so completely
as to express a wish "that the buck's horns had
been in the king's belly."

But, however that may have been, there lived at
that time, under Clarence's protection, an ecclesiastic
named John Stacey, famed for his learning
and skill in astrology. Having been denounced as
a necromancer, and accused of exercising his unlawful
art for the destruction of Richard, Lord
Beauchamp, Stacey was put to the rack and tortured
into naming Thomas Burdet as his accomplice
in some treasonable practices. Burdet was[Pg 385]
accordingly arrested on the charge of conspiring to
kill the king and the Prince of Wales by casting
their nativity, and of scattering among the people
papers predicting their death.

Having been taken to Westminster Hall, Burdet
and Stacey were tried before the Court of King's
Bench. But that court was no longer presided over
by a Fortescue or a Markham, and it was in vain
that Burdet pleaded his innocence, declaring that, so
far from having any design against the king's life,
he was ready to fight for the king's crown, as he had
done before. His fate was sealed: the jury returned
a verdict of "Guilty;" the knight and ecclesiastic
were sentenced to death; and, having been drawn
from the Tower, they were executed as traitors at
Tyburn.

The matter did not rest here. On learning the
result of his adherents' trial, Clarence, who was in
Ireland, naturally felt somewhat dismayed. Recollecting
how the proceedings against Eleanor Cobham
had served as a prelude to the destruction of
Duke Humphrey, and apprehending in this case a
similar result, he determined to stir in his own defense,
and rushed into the snare which his enemies
had set. Hurrying to England, and reaching Westminster
in the king's absence, he entered the council
chamber, showed the lords there assembled private
confessions and declarations of innocence made[Pg 386]
by Burdet and Stacey, and protested vehemently
against the execution that had taken place.

At Windsor the king received intelligence of the
step Clarence had taken; and the affair being reported
to him in the worst light, he appears to have
been seized with something like temporary insanity,
and to have regarded Clarence's destruction as essential
to his own safety and that of his children.
No sooner, in any case, was news conveyed to him
that Clarence was "flying in the face of all justice,"
than he hastened to Westminster, summoned the
duke to the palace, and ordered him to be committed
to the Tower.

Having pushed matters to this crisis, the Woodvilles
did not allow Edward's passion to cool. It
was in vain that the lord chancellor attempted to
reconcile the king and the captive. A Parliament
was summoned to meet about the middle of January;
and when, on the appointed day, the English
senators assembled at Westminster, the judges were
summoned to the House of Lords, and Clarence was
brought to the bar to be tried by his peers       the
young Duke of Buckingham, who had married the
queen's sister, presiding as lord high steward, and
Edward appearing personally as accuser. Absurd
as some of the charges were, Clarence had no chance
of escape. He was charged with having dealt with
the devil through necromancers; represented Edward[Pg 387]
as illegitimate and without right to the throne;
plotted to dethrone the king and disinherit the king's
children; retained possession of an act of Parliament,
whereby, in the reign of Henry, he had been declared
heir to the crown after Edward of Lancaster;
purchased the support of the Lancastrians by promising
to restore their confiscated estates; and warned
his own retainers to be ready to take up arms at
an hour's notice. Clarence indignantly denied every
charge; but his protestations of innocence were as
vain as those of Burdet had been. Edward appeared
bent on a conviction, and the peers had not the courage
to resist such a pleader. The royal brothers, indeed,
would seem to have had all the talk to themselves       "no
one denying Clarence but the king, and
no one answering the king but Clarence." Even
the self-sufficient Buckingham contented himself
with asking the judges "whether the matters proved
against Clarence amounted in law to high treason."
The opinion of the judges was altogether unfavorable
to the duke. The legal functionaries answered
the lord high steward's question in the affirmative,
and the peers returned a unanimous verdict of
"Guilty." On the 7th of February Buckingham
pronounced sentence of death.

When matters reached this alarming stage, the
Duchess of York interfered; and the king, in a
somewhat relenting mood, delayed sending his brother[Pg 388]
to the block. The Woodvilles, however, were
not to be baffled of their prey; and the House of
Commons, acting under their influence, petitioned
for the duke's immediate execution. But the son-in-law
of Warwick, with all his failings, was still
the idol of the populace; and the policy of having
him beheaded on Tower Hill was more than
doubtful.

Ere this, Clarence had been reconducted to the
Tower, and lodged in that part of the metropolitan
fortress where resided the Master Provider of the
King's Bows. In a gloomy chamber of "The
Bowyer Tower," the duke, sad and solitary, passed
several weeks, while his enemies decided what
should be his fate. At length, about the beginning
of March, it was rumored that the captive had died
of grief and despair. The populace immediately
raised a shout of indignation on hearing of the
death of their "Good Duke," and sternly refused
to believe that he had not had foul play. Ere long
the story which Shakspeare has made so familiar
was whispered about.

The execution of Clarence having been determined
on       such was the popular account       he was
allowed the privilege of choosing what death he
should die; and, having an objection to appear on
the scaffold, he elected to be drowned in that liquor
with which he had so often washed down care and[Pg 389]
remorse. A butt of Malmsey was accordingly introduced
to the gloomy chamber in which he was
lodged; and, one end of the cask having been
knocked out, he was plunged into the wine, with
his head down, and held in that position till life
was extinct. His body was carried to Tewkesbury,
and laid beside that of his duchess in the abbey
church.

Having accomplished their revenge on the king's
brother, the queen's kinsmen looked out for something
wherewith to gratify their avarice. On this
point the Woodvilles were, as usual, successful. To
Earl Rivers was given part of the estates of Clarence;
and to the Marquis of Dorset the wardship
of the son of the murdered duke. The king, however,
was the reverse of satisfied. He never recalled
the name of Clarence without a feeling of penitence;
and afterward, when sued for any man's pardon, he
was in the habit of exclaiming mournfully, "Ah! I
once had an unfortunate brother, and for his life not
one man would open his mouth."

CHAPTER XL.

KING EDWARD'S DEATH.


For some years after the treaty of Picquigny,
Edward of York, trusting to the friendship and relying
on the pension of King Louis, passed his time
in inglorious ease; and Elizabeth Woodville, elate
with the prospect of her daughter sharing the throne
of a Valois, persisted in pestering the crafty monarch
of France with inquiries when she was to send him
her young dauphiness. Meanwhile, Louis, who had
no intention whatever of maintaining faith with the
King of England one day longer than prudence dictated,
was looking about for a more advantageous
alliance for the heir to his throne.

After appearing for some time utterly unsuspicious,
Edward, in 1480, resolved on sending an embassador
to Paris, and Sir John Howard was selected
as the man to urge a speedy celebration of the
marriage. The plans of Louis were not then quite
ripe, but his statecraft did not desert him; and,
at length, after Howard had for some time been
silenced by bribes, and Edward deluded by flattering
assurances, he set the treaty of Picquigny at
defiance, and contracted a marriage between the[Pg 391]
dauphin and a daughter of the Emperor Maximilian.

Fortunately for Louis, Edward was a much less
formidable personage than of yore. Since returning
from his French expedition, the English king
had given himself up to luxury and indolence. He
had drunk deep, kept late hours, sat long over the
wine-cup, and gratified his sensual inclinations with
little regard either to his dignity as a king or his
honor as a man. Dissipation and debauchery had
ruined his health and obscured his intellect. Even
his appearance was changed for the worse. His
person had become corpulent, and his figure had
lost its grace. He was no longer the Edward of
Towton or of Tewkesbury.

On discovering, however, how completely he had
been duped, Edward displayed some sparks of the
savage valor which, in other days, had made him so
terrible a foe. Rousing himself to projects of revenge,
he vowed to carry such a war into France
as that country had never before experienced, and
commenced preparations for executing his threats.
As his resentment appeared implacable, Louis deemed
it prudent to find him work nearer home; and,
with this object, excited the King of Scots to undertake
a war against England.

Some successes achieved by Gloucester in Scotland
emboldened Edward in his projects. It happened,[Pg 392]
however, that he did not live even to attempt
the execution of his threats. The excess of
his rage against Louis had been such as seriously to
affect his health; and, about Easter, 1483, in his
forty-second year, the warlike king was laid prostrate
with a fever in the Palace of Westminster.
Stretched on a bed of sickness, the king found his
constitution rapidly giving way; and, losing faith in
the skill of his physicians, he referred his quarrel
with Louis to the judgment of God, and summoned
the lords of his court to bid them farewell.

The king, indeed, could not fail to be anxious as
to the fortunes of the family he was leaving. Ever
since his ill-starred marriage the court had been
distracted by the feuds of the queen's kindred and
the old nobility of England. The death of Warwick
and the judicial murder of Clarence had by
no means restored harmony. At the head of one
party figured the queen's brother, Earl Rivers, and
her son, the Marquis of Dorset; at the head of the
other was the Duke of Buckingham, with whom
sided the Lords Stanley and Hastings. Difficult as
the task might be, Edward hoped to reconcile the
hostile factions ere going to his grave.

When the lords appeared in the king's chamber,
and assembled around his bed, Edward addressed to
them an impressive speech. Having indicated his
brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, as the fittest[Pg 393]
person to be Protector of the realm, he expressed
much anxiety about the affairs of his kingdom and
family, pointed out the perils of discord in a state,
and lamented that it had been his lot "to win the
courtesy of men's knees by the fall of so many heads."
After thus smoothing the way, as it were, he put it
to his lords, as a last request, that they should lay
aside all variance, and love one another. At this
solemn appeal the lords acted their parts with a decorum
which imposed on the dying man. Two celebrated
characters, indeed, were absent, whose talents
for dissimulation could not have failed to distinguish
them. Gloucester was on the borders of
Scotland, and Rivers on the marches of Wales; so
that Richard Plantagenet, with his dark guile, and
Anthony Woodville, with his airy pretensions, were
wanting to complete the scene. But Hastings, Dorset,
and others, though their hearts were far asunder,
shook hands and embraced with every semblance
of friendship; and the king dismissed them
with the idea that he had effected a reconciliation.

His affairs on earth thus settled, as he believed,
Edward proceeded to make his peace with heaven.
Having received such consolations as the Church
administers to frail men when they are going to judgment,
and committed his soul to the mercy of God,
Edward awaited the coming of the Great Destroyer.
On the 9th of April his hour arrived; and, complaining[Pg 394]
of drowsiness, he turned on his side. While in
that position he fell into the sleep that knows no
breaking; and his spirit, which had so often luxuriated
in carnage and strife, departed in peace.

On the day when the king breathed his last he
lay exposed in the Palace of Westminster, that the
lords, temporal and spiritual, and the municipal
functionaries of London might have an opportunity
of ascertaining that he had not been murdered.
This ceremony over, the body was seared and removed
to St. Stephen's Chapel, and there watched
by nobles, while masses were sung.

Windsor had been selected as the place of interment.
Ere being conveyed to its last resting-place,
however, the corpse, covered with cloth of gold, was
carried to the Abbey of Westminster under a rich
canopy of cloth imperial, supported by four knights,
Sir John Howard bearing the banner in front of the
procession, and the officers of arms walking around.
Mass having been again performed at Westminster,
the mortal remains of the warrior-king were placed
in a chariot drawn by six horses, and conveyed, by
slow stages, along the banks of the Thames. Having
been met at the gates of Windsor, and perfumed
with odors by the Archbishop of York and the
Bishop of Winchester the corpse was borne in solemn
procession to the Chapel of St. George, where,
placed in the choir, on a hearse blazing with lights[Pg 395]
and surrounded with banners, it was watched for
the night by nobles and esquires. Another mass,
more religious solemnities, a few more ceremonies
befitting the rank of the deceased, and the last Plantagenet
whose obsequies were performed with royal
honors was committed to the tomb.



[Pg 396]




CHAPTER XLI.

THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER.


Whether Richard the Third, with his hunch
back, withered arm, splay feet, goggle eyes, and
swarthy countenance, as portrayed by poets and
chroniclers of the Tudor period, very closely resembles
the Richard of Baynard's Castle and Bosworth
Field, is a question which philosophical historians
have answered in the negative. The evidence of
the old Countess of Desmond, when brought to light
by Horace Walpole in 1758, first began to set the
world right on this subject. Born about the middle
of the fifteenth century, she lived       when the
Plantagenets had been displaced by the Tudors, and
the Tudors succeeded by the Stuarts       to affirm, in
the seventeenth century, that, in her youth, she had
danced with Richard at his brother's court, and that
he whom historians had, in deference to Tudor prejudices,
represented as a monster of ugliness, was in
reality the handsomest man in the room except his
brother Edward, and that he was very well made.

It can not be denied that the Countess of Desmond's
description of Richard appears extremely
complimentary; and, indeed, it would have been[Pg 397]
something novel in human nature if this lady of the
house of Fitzgerald, in old age and penury, had not
been inclined to exaggerate the personal advantages
of a Plantagenet prince who, in the days of her
youth and hope, had distinguished her by his attention.
Evidence, however, exists in abundance to
prove that Richard was utterly unlike the deformed
ruffian introduced into history by the scribes and
sheriffs of London, who plied their pens with an eye
to the favor of the Tudors.

Portraits and authentic descriptions of the last
Plantagenet king which have come down to posterity
convey the idea of a man rather under-sized and hard-featured,
with dark brown hair, an intellectual forehead,
a face slightly deficient in length, dark, thoughtful
eyes, and a short neck, and shoulders somewhat
unequal, giving an appearance of inelegance to a
figure, spare indeed, and wanting in bulk, but wiry,
robust, and sinewy; trained by exercise to endure
fatigue, and capable on occasions of exercising almost
superhuman strength. Such, clad in garments
far more gorgeous than good taste would have approved,
his head bent forward on his bosom, his
hand playing with his dagger, as if in restlessness
of mood, and his lips moving as if in soliloquy, appeared
to his contemporaries the subtle politician
who, at Baynard's Castle, schemed for the crown of
St. Edward. Such, arrayed in Milan steel, bestriding[Pg 398]
a white steed, the emblem of sovereignty, with
a surcoat of brilliant colors over his armor, a crown
of ornament around his helmet, a trusty lance skillfully
poised in his hand, and an intense craving for
vengeance gnawing at his heart, appeared the fiery
warrior whose desperate valor well-nigh saved St.
Edward's crown from fortune and the foe on Bosworth
Field.



[Pg 399]




CHAPTER XLII.

THE PROTECTOR AND THE PROTECTORATE.


Before "giving up his soul to God" in the
Palace of Westminster, the fourth Edward nominated
his brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, as
Protector of England during the minority of Edward
the Fifth. The choice was one of which the
nation could not but approve. Richard was in the
thirty-first year of his life, and in the full vigor of
his intellect; with faculties refined by education
and sharpened by use; knowledge of mankind, acquired
in civil strife and in the experience of startling
vicissitudes of fortune; a courage in battle
which had made his slight form and grisly cognizance
terrible to foes on fields of fame; a genius
for war which had given him an enviable reputation
throughout Christendom; a temper hitherto so
carefully kept under restraint that any man hinting
at the excess of its ferocity would have been deemed
insane; and an ambition hitherto so well masked
by affected humility that no one could have imagined
it capable of prompting political crimes, unjustifiable,
save by those Italian maxims associated with
the name of Machiavelli.

[Pg 400]

It was on the 2d of October, 1452, shortly after
the Roses were plucked in the Temple Gardens, that
Cicely, Duchess of York, gave birth to her youngest
son, Richard, in the Castle of Fotheringay. He
was, therefore, scarcely three years old when the
Wars of the Roses commenced at St. Albans, and
little more than eight when the Duke of York was
slain by the Lancastrians on Wakefield Green.
Alarmed, after that event, at the aspect of affairs,
warned by the murder of her second son, the boy-Earl
of Rutland, and eager to save George and
Richard from the fate of their elder brother, the
Duchess Cicely sent them to Holland, trusting that,
even in case of the Lancastrians triumphing, the
Duke of Burgundy would generously afford them
protection and insure them safety.

After being sent to the Continent, Richard and
his brother remained for some time in secret at
Utrecht; but the Duke of Burgundy, hearing that
the young Plantagenets were in that city, had them
sought out and escorted to Bruges, where they were
received with the honors due to their rank. When,
however, his victory at Towton made Edward King
of England, he requested Burgundy to send the
princes; and, in the spring of 1461, "The Good
Duke" had them honorably escorted to Calais on
their way home. When, after their return to England,
George was dignified with the dukedom of
Clarence, Richard became Duke of Gloucester.

[Pg 401]

At an early age, Richard, who was energetic and
highly educated, acquired great influence over the
indolent and illiterate Edward; and in the summer
of 1470, when scarcely eighteen, he was appointed
Warden of the West Marches. The return of
Warwick from France interrupting his tenure of
office, he shared his brother's flight to the territories
of the Duke of Burgundy; and when Edward landed
at Ravenspur, to conquer or die, Richard was by
his side, and proved an ally of no mean prowess.
Being intrusted with high command at Barnet and
Tewkesbury, his conduct won him high reputation;
and, in spite of his foppery and fondness for dress
and gay apparel, he showed himself, at both of these
battles, a sage counselor in camp and a fiery warrior
in conflict.

The Lancastrians having been put down and peace
restored, Richard turned his thoughts to matrimony,
and resolved to espouse Anne Neville, daughter
of Warwick and widow of Edward of Lancaster.
Clarence, wishing to keep the Warwick baronies to
himself, as husband of Isabel Neville, attempted, by
concealing her sister, to prevent this marriage. But
Richard was not to be baffled. He discovered the
fair Anne in London, disguised as a cook-maid, and
carrying the youthful widow off, placed her for security
in the sanctuary of St. Martin's. Nevertheless,
Clarence continued unreasonable. "Richard[Pg 402]
may have my sister-in-law if he will," he said, "but
we will part no livelihood." Edward, however,
took the matter in hand, pacified his brothers, allotted
Anne a handsome portion out of the Warwick
estates, and had the marriage with Richard
forthwith solemnized. One son, destined to figure
for a brief period as Prince of Wales, was the result
of this union.

Years rendered memorable by the inglorious expedition
to France and the unfortunate execution
of Clarence passed over; and in 1482, when Edward
conspired with the exiled Duke of Albany to
dethrone James, King of Scots, Richard, who, among
his contemporaries, had acquired the reputation of
being "a man of deep reach and policy," was intrusted
with the conduct of the war. Having been
nominated lieutenant general against the Scots, and
joined by the Earl of Northumberland and Lord
Stanley, he led twenty-five thousand men across
the Tweed, regained Berwick, which had been surrendered
by Queen Margaret, and marched to the
gates of Edinburgh. By this expedition Richard
acquired an increase of popularity; and he was still
in the north when Edward the Fourth departed
this life and his son was proclaimed as Edward the
Fifth.

At that time the young king       a boy of thirteen       was
residing in the Castle of Ludlow, on the marches[Pg 403]
of Wales, and receiving his education under the
auspices of his maternal uncle, Anthony Woodville,
Earl Rivers. Anthony was eminently qualified
for the post of tutor, and every precaution appears
to have been taken to render the boy worthy
of the crown which he was destined never to wear.

While the news of his father's death was traveling
to young Edward at Ludlow, the feud between
the ancient nobility and the queen's kindred broke
out afresh at Westminster, and London was agitated
by the factious strife. Elizabeth, jealous of the designs
of the adverse faction, wrote to Rivers to raise
a large force in Wales, and conduct the king to the
capital to be crowned; and she empowered her son,
the Marquis of Dorset, who was Constable of the
Tower, to take the royal treasure out of that fortress,
and fit out a fleet. Hastings, alarmed at these
indications of suspicion, threatened to retire to Calais,
of which he was captain; and both parties appealed
to Richard, who had hitherto so acted as to
give offense to neither.

Richard, on learning the state of affairs, immediately
wrote to the queen, recommending that the
army gathering round her son should be dismissed;
and the royal widow, who was totally devoid of the
intellect and sagacity necessary for such a crisis,
dispatched a messenger to her brother to disband
his troops. The young king, however, set out from[Pg 404]
Ludlow, and, attended by Earl Rivers, Elizabeth's
second son, Richard Grey, and Sir Thomas Vaughan,
he approached Northampton on the 22d of April,
and learned that Richard had already arrived at
that town.

Richard, as we have said, was on the frontiers of
Scotland when his brother expired at Westminster.
On receiving intelligence of this sad event he rode
southward to York, and entered that city with a
retinue of six hundred knights and esquires, all
dressed, like himself, in deep mourning. At York he
ordered a grand funeral service to be performed in
the Cathedral; and, having summoned the magnates
of the neighborhood to swear fealty to Edward the
Fifth, he set them the example by taking the oath
first. After going through this ceremony, he wrote
to Elizabeth Woodville and to Earl Rivers, expressing
the utmost loyalty and affection for the young
king; but, at the same time, a messenger was sent
to the Duke of Buckingham appointing a meeting
at Northampton.

Again taking the road southward, Richard reached
Northampton on the 22d of April; and, learning
that the king was every hour expected, he resolved
to await the arrival of his nephew and escort
him safely to London. Ere long Rivers and Richard
Grey appeared to pay their respects, and announce
that the king had gone forward to Stony[Pg 405]
Stratford. Richard, who had hitherto given the
Woodvilles no cause for suspicion, was doubtless
somewhat surprised at this intelligence. He, however,
suppressed his emotions, listened patiently to
Anthony's frivolous apology about fearing that
Northampton would have been too small a place to
accommodate so many people, and with the utmost
courtesy invited the uncle and nephew to remain
and sup.

Rivers and Grey accepted without hesitation an
invitation given in so friendly a tone; and soon
after, Buckingham arrived at the head of three hundred
horsemen. Every thing went calmly. The two
dukes passed the evening with Rivers and Grey;
they all talked in the most friendly way; and next
morning they rode together to Stony Stratford.

On reaching Stony Stratford, Richard found the
king mounting to renew his journey; and this circumstance
seems to have convinced him that he was
intended by the Woodvilles first as a dupe and then
as a victim. At all events, their evident anxiety to
prevent an interview between him and his nephew
afforded him a fair opportunity for taking strong
measures, and he did not hesitate. Turning to Rivers
and Grey, he immediately charged them with
estranging the affections of his nephew, and caused
them to be arrested along with Sir Thomas Vaughan.

Having ordered the prisoners to be conveyed to[Pg 406]
the castle of Sheriff Hutton, Richard and Buckingham
bent their knees to their youthful sovereign,
and explained to him that Rivers, Grey, and Dorset
were traitors; but Edward, educated by his maternal
relatives and much attached to them, could not
conceal his displeasure at their arrest.

This scene over, Richard dismissed all domestics
with whom Rivers had surrounded the young king,
and conducted his nephew toward London, giving
out as he went that the Woodvilles had been conspiring.
On the 4th of May they approached the
metropolis; and at Hornsey Wood they were met
by Lord-mayor Shaw, with the sheriffs and aldermen,
in their scarlet robes, and five hundred of the
citizens, clad in violet and gallantly mounted. Attended
as became a king, young Edward entered
London. Richard rode bareheaded before his nephew;
many knights and nobles followed; and, amid
loud acclamations from the populace, Edward the
Fifth was conducted to the Bishop's Palace. A
grand council was then summoned, and Richard
was declared Protector of England.

Meanwhile, Elizabeth Woodville had been seized
with dread. Alarmed at the report that her brother
and son were under arrest, and apprehensive of
Richard's intentions, she fled to the sanctuary with
her five daughters, her eldest son, the Marquis of
Dorset, and her youngest son, Richard, a boy of ten,[Pg 407]
who had been created Duke of York, and contracted
in marriage to an heiress of the Mowbrays who
died in infancy. The king, on learning that his
mother was alarmed, expressed his grief with tears
in his eyes. At first Richard only protested his
loyalty, and marveled that his nephew should be so
melancholy; but ere long he resolved to turn the
royal boy's unhappiness to account, and with this
view sent the Archbishop of York to Elizabeth to
say that, to the king's happiness, the company of
his brother was essential.

The prelate carried the Protector's message to
the sanctuary, and found the mournful mother earnestly
opposed to delivering up the Duke of York.
The archbishop, however, told her plainly that if she
did not consent, he feared some sharper course would
speedily be taken; and at this warning Elizabeth,
who was at once timorous and imprudent, began to
yield. At length she took the boy by the hand and
led him to the archbishop. "My lord," she said,
"here he is. For my own part, I never will deliver
him freely; but if you must needs have, take him,
and at your hands I will require him."

At that time Richard and other lords were in the
Star Chamber, and thither the archbishop led the
weeping boy. As they entered, Richard rose, embraced
his nephew affectionately, and exclaimed with
characteristic dissimulation, "Welcome, nephew,[Pg 408]
with all my heart. Next to my sovereign lord,
your brother, nothing gives me so much contentment
as your presence." A few days after this scene was
enacted, Richard declared that it was necessary that
the king and his brother should be sent to some
place of security till the distempers of the commonwealth
were healed; and a great council, summoned
to discuss the question, resolved, on the motion of
Buckingham, that the princes should be sent to the
Tower. Accordingly, they were conducted to the
metropolitan fortress; and it was intimated that
they were to remain there till preparations had been
made for the king's coronation.

The fate of Rivers, Grey, and Vaughan having
been decided on, the 13th of June was appointed as
the day of execution; and Sir Richard Ratcliffe, an
unscrupulous agent of Richard, was intrusted with
the ceremony. Anthony Woodville was prevented
from addressing the people on the occasion, and posterity
has been deprived of the satisfaction of reading
the accomplished adventurer's vindication; but
Vaughan was more lucky in his effort to be heard.

"I appeal," said Vaughan, solemnly, "to God's
high tribunal against the Duke of Gloucester for
this wrongful murder."

"You have made a goodly appeal," said Ratcliffe,
with a sneer, "so lay down your head."

"I die in the right, Ratcliffe," answered Vaughan;[Pg 409]
and, preparing to submit to the blow, he added,
"Take heed that you die not in the wrong."

Ere disposing of the Woodvilles, Richard persuaded
himself that his dream of the crown might
be realized, and by bribes and promises purchased
Buckingham's aid in overthrowing the obstacles that
stood in his way. Anxious, also, to gain over Hastings,
he deputed the task of sounding him to William
Catesby, an eminent lawyer, who descended
from an ancient family at Lapworth, in Warwickshire,
and who was destined to acquire an unenviable
notoriety in Richard's service. The result was
not satisfactory. In fact, Hastings, though he heartily
concurred in Richard's measures against the
Woodvilles, was determined to stand by Edward's
sons to the death; and, ere long, matters arrived at
such a pass that, while Richard sat at the head of a
majority of the council at Crosby Hall, Hastings
presided over a minority at the Tower. The party
of Hastings appeared formidable. Lord Stanley,
among others, took part in its proceedings; and
Stanley's son, George, Lord Strange, was reported
to be levying forces in Lancashire to give effect to
its decisions. Richard was not blind to the fact
that if he did not destroy the confederacy forthwith
it would destroy him. At such a crisis he was
neither so timid nor so scrupulous as to hesitate as
to the means.

[Pg 410]

Some years before his death, Edward of York,
while pursuing his amours in the city of London,
was captivated by the charms of Jane Shore, a
young city dame, whose name occupies an unfortunate
place in the history of the period. This
woman, after being for seven years the wife of a
reputable goldsmith, allowed herself, in an evil hour,
to be lured from the house of her husband, and figured
for some time as the king's mistress. Notwithstanding
her equivocal position, however, Mistress
Shore exhibited many redeeming qualities.
Her wit and beauty giving her great influence over
Edward, she exercised it for worthy purposes, and
was ever ready to relieve the needy, to shield the
innocent, and protect the oppressed.

When Edward had been laid at rest in St.
George's Chapel, and Elizabeth Woodville fled to
the sanctuary, Mistress Shore manifested much sympathy
for the distressed queen; and, having formed
an intimacy with Lord Hastings, she framed something
resembling a plot against the Protector. Elizabeth
at once forgave Hastings the hostility he had
displayed toward her kindred, and forgave Mistress
Shore for having supplanted her in Edward's affections,
and the three became allies. Richard's jealousy
was aroused, and he resolved to make this extraordinary
alliance the means of effecting the ruin
of Hastings.

[Pg 411]

It was Friday, the 13th of June       the day on
which Rivers, Grey, and Vaughan suffered at Pontefract       and
Hastings, Stanley, the Bishop of Ely, the
Archbishop of York, with other men of mark, had
assembled at nine o'clock in the Tower, when the
Protector suddenly entered the council chamber and
took his seat at the table. Richard appeared in a
lively mood, conversed for a while gayly with those
present, and quite surprised them by the mirth
which he exhibited.

Having set the lords somewhat at their ease and
persuaded them to proceed with business, Richard
begged them to spare him for a while, and, leaving
the council chamber, he remained absent for an
hour. Between ten and eleven he returned, but
frowning and fretting, knitting his brow and biting
his lips.

"What punishment," he asked, seating himself,
"do they deserve who have imagined and compassed
my destruction, who am so nearly related to the
king, and intrusted with the government of the
realm?"

"Whoever they be," answered Hastings, after a
pause, "they deserve the death of traitors."

"These traitors," cried Richard, "are the sorceress
my brother's wife, and her accomplice, Jane
Shore, his mistress, with others, their associates,
who have, by their witchcraft, wasted my body."

[Pg 412]

"Certainly, my lord," said Hastings, after exhibiting
some confusion, "if they be guilty of these
crimes, they deserve the severest punishment."

"What?" exclaimed Richard, furiously, "do you
reply to me with ifs and with ands? I tell thee
they have so done, and that I will make good on
your body, traitor."

After threatening Hastings, Richard struck the
council table, and immediately a cry of "Treason"
arose, and armed men rushed into the chamber.

"I arrest thee, traitor," said Richard, turning to
Hastings.

"Me, my lord?" asked Hastings, in surprise.

"Yes, thee, traitor," said Richard; "and, by St.
Paul, I swear I will not to dinner till I have thy
head off."

While this conversation was passing between the
Protector and Hastings, one of the soldiers, as if by
accident or mistake, struck a blow at Lord Stanley.
But the noble baron, who had no ambition to share
his ally's fate, and who, indeed, contrived to carry
his wise head to the grave, saved himself on this occasion
by jerking under the table, and escaped without
any other bodily injury than a bruise.

While Lord Stanley, the Archbishop of York, and
the Bishop of Ely were arrested, and shut up in various
parts of the Tower, Hastings was hurried outside
for immediate execution. Richard would not[Pg 413]
even allow the headsman time enough to erect a
scaffold; but a log of wood answered the purpose.
This, having been found in the court of the Tower,
was carried to the green near the chapel; and the
lord chamberlain, after being led thither, was without
farther ceremony beheaded. At the same time
the sheriffs of London proceeded to Mistress Shore's
house, took possession of her goods, which were
valued at three thousand marks, and conveyed her
through the city to the Tower. On being brought
before the council, however, on the charge of sorcery,
no evidence worthy of credit was produced,
and an acquittal was the consequence.

The sudden execution of the lord chamberlain
naturally excited much interest in the city; and, as
Hastings happened to be a great favorite with the
inhabitants, Richard deemed it necessary to vouchsafe
an explanation. Having therefore sent for
some of the influential citizens, and frankly justified
himself as having acted simply in self-defense,
he, within two hours, caused a proclamation, under
the great seal, fairly written on parchment, to be
read by a herald-at-arms, with great solemnity, in
various parts of London. Unfortunately, this vindication
appeared so soon after the execution that
people could not help suspecting that it had been
drawn up before.

"Here's a gay goodly cast," remarked the schoolmaster[Pg 414]
of St. Paul's, as the document was read at
the Cross, "soul cast away for haste."

"Ay," said a merchant standing by, "I think it
has been written by the spirit of prophecy."



[Pg 415]




CHAPTER XLIII.

THE USURPATION.


After mewing the princes in the Tower, beheading
Hastings in London and the Woodvilles at Pontefract,
placing such foes to his pretensions as Lord
Stanley and the Bishop of Ely under lock and key,
and arousing the people's moral indignation by the
scandal of a king's widow taking counsel with her
husband's mistress to embarrass the government
carried on in the name of her son, Richard applied
himself resolutely to secure the prize on which he
had set his heart. Ere long, the citizens who discussed
the proclamation about Hastings were destined
to have fresh subjects for gossip.

Among the numerous ladies upon whom Edward,
about the beginning of his reign, cast admiring eyes,
was Eleanor Talbot, granddaughter of the great
Earl of Shrewsbury. This patrician dame was the
widow of Lord Butler of Sudeley, and had seen fifteen
more summers than her royal lover. Edward,
not on that account the less enamored, asked her to
become his wife; and, won by the ardor of his attachment,
Eleanor consented to a secret marriage.
The ceremony was performed by Dr. Stillington,[Pg 416]
Bishop of Bath; but, as time passed on, the Yorkist
king's amorous heart led him into another engagement,
and the neglected Eleanor was astonished
with news of his having married Elizabeth Woodville.
On hearing of his faithlessness she fell into
a profound melancholy, and afterward lived in sadness
and retirement.

This silent repudiation of a daughter of their
house shocked the propriety and hurt the pride of
the Talbots, and they applied to Stillington to demand
satisfaction. Not relishing the perilous duty,
the bishop spoke to Richard on the subject, and
Gloucester mentioned it to the king. This intercession
proved of no avail; and Edward displayed
such fury on learning that the secret was known,
that nobody who valued a head would have cared
to allude to it while he was on the throne. But
Richard, who had not forgotten a circumstance so
important, now saw that the time had come when
the secret might be used to advance his own fortunes.
It was necessary, however, that the facts
should be published in such a way as to produce a
strong impression, and a plan was devised for bringing
together a multitude.

For this purpose, Richard caused Mistress Shore
to be again dragged into public, and tried before
the spiritual courts for her scandalous manner of
life. The Protector was not this time disappointed.[Pg 417]
However unfounded the charge of sorcery, there was
no lack of evidence as to her frailties, and she was
condemned to do open penance. Sunday was appointed
for this act of humiliation; and on that
day, through streets crowded with spectators, the
erring woman was under the necessity of walking to
St. Paul's barefooted, wrapped in a white sheet, and
holding a lighted taper of wax in her hand.

This exhibition was of itself deemed likely to advance
the Protector's interests by impressing people
with a high opinion of his worth as a reformer of
morals; but Richard had arranged that, ere the
crowd assembled as spectators had time to disperse,
another and a far more important scene should be
enacted. In this the chief actor was Dr. Shaw, an
Augustine friar of high reputation and great popularity.
Mounting the pulpit at St. Paul's Cross,
Shaw, who was a brother of the lord-mayor and an
adherent of the Protector, preached from the text,
"The multiplying brood of the ungodly shall not
thrive, nor take deep rooting from bastard slips;"
and proceeded boldly to prove that the princes in
the Tower were illegitimate.

Richard appears to have found this stratagem unsuccessful;
but he did not dream of abandoning his
ambitious project. Nor can he, with justice, be severely
blamed for setting aside the sons of Elizabeth
Woodville. However the matter may have been[Pg 418]
slurred over by men writing with the fear of the
Tudors before their eyes, hardly any doubt can exist
that Edward was guilty of bigamy, and that his
marriage with Elizabeth was invalid; for Philip de
Comines bears witness to having heard Bishop Stillington
state that he had married the king to Lady
Butler; and Eleanor undoubtedly survived that unfortunate
ceremony performed on a May morning in
the chapel at Grafton.

But the illegitimacy of Edward's offspring did not
make Richard heir of the house of York. Between
him and the crown stood the children of Clarence,
Edward Plantagenet, Earl of Warwick, and his sister
Margaret, afterward Countess of Salisbury and
mother of Cardinal Pole. The claim of these children
was such as could not decently be rejected; but,
having gone too far to recede, Richard pretended that
their father's attainder disqualified them from inheriting,
and adopted measures for usurping the crown.

Richard again invoked the aid of Buckingham;
and, on the Tuesday after Dr. Shaw's sermon, attended
by nobles, knights, and citizens, Buckingham appeared
on the hustings at Guildhall, and harangued
the populace. The duke's oratory was successful.
Some of the wealthy citizens, indeed, asked time for
consideration; but the multitude tossed their bonnets
in the air, and shouted, "Long live King Richard."

[Pg 419]

At Baynard's Castle, with the Duchess of York,
Richard was then residing; and thither, to wait
upon him, the citizens sent a deputation, headed by
the lord-mayor and accompanied by Buckingham.
On being informed that a number of people were in
the castle court, Richard affected alarm and declined
to receive them; but, at length, they were admitted,
and Buckingham presented an address, praying Richard
to take the crown as his by right of birth and
the election of the estates of the realm.

"I little thought, cousin," said Richard, angrily,
"that you, of all men, would have moved me to a
matter which, of all things, I most decline."

"The free people of England will never be ruled
by a bastard," said Buckingham; "and if you, the
true heir, refuse the crown, they know where to find
another who will gladly accept it."

"Well," said Richard, with the air of a man making
a great sacrifice, "since I perceive that the whole
realm is resolved not to permit my nephew to reign,
and that the right of succession belongs to me, I am
content to submit to the will of the people."

On hearing this speech the citizens raised a cry of
"Long live King Richard, our sovereign lord;" and
the brief reign of Edward the Fifth was at an end.



[Pg 420]




CHAPTER XLIV.

RICHARD'S CORONATION.


When Richard had expressed his intention to
usurp the English crown, he fixed the 6th day of
July, 1483, for his coronation, and caused preparations
to be made for performing the ceremony with
such magnificence as was likely to render the occasion
memorable. Never had arrangements been
made on so splendid a scale for investing a king of
England with the symbols of power.

At the same time Richard took precautions against
any opposition that might be offered by the friends
of Elizabeth Woodville. From the north were
brought five thousand fighting men, "evil appareled,
and worse harnessed, in rusty armor, neither defensible
for proof nor scoured for show," but with
fearless hearts and strong hands. Their leader was
one whose name a Woodville could hardly hear
without growing pale. For it was Robin of Redesdale,
who, in other days, had led the half mob, half
army that seized and beheaded old Earl Rivers, and
that son of Earl Rivers who, while in his teens, had
wedded a dowager duchess in her eighty-second year.
On the 4th of July these northern soldiers encamped[Pg 421]
in Finsbury Fields, and inspired the citizens of
London with emotions of doubt and apprehension.

On the day when Robin of Redesdale and his men
startled London, Richard and his ill-starred queen       the
Anne Neville of earlier and happier times       took
their barge at Baynard's Castle, and went by
water to the Tower. After releasing Lord Stanley
and the Archbishop of York, that they might take
part in the coronation, the king created his son Edward
Prince of Wales, nominated Lord Lovel to the
office of lord chamberlain, vacant by the execution
of Hastings, and appointed Sir Robert Brackenbury,
the younger son of an ancient family long settled at
Sallaby, in the Bishopric of Durham, to the lieutenancy
of the Tower. At the same time he bestowed
on Sir John Howard the dukedom of Norfolk,
and to Thomas, eldest son of that pretentious
personage, he gave the earldom of Surrey. Gratified
as the vanity of the Howards might be, Sir John
must have blushed, if, indeed, capable of so much
decorum, as he thought of the disconsolate woman
in the sanctuary, and remembered the letter which,
twenty years earlier, at the time of her marriage, he
had written to her father, Sir Richard Woodville.

At length the day appointed for the ceremony arrived,
and Richard prepared to place the crown of
St. Edward on his head. "The king, with Queen
Anne, his wife," says the chronicler, "came down[Pg 422]
out of the Whitehall into the great hall at Westminster,
and went directly to the King's Bench, and
from thence, going upon Ray-cloth, barefooted, went
to St. Edward's Shrine; all his nobility going with
him, every lord in his degree."

A magnificent banquet in Westminster Hall
brought the coronation ceremony to a conclusion;
and, in the midst of the banquet, Sir Robert Dymoke,
as king's champion, rode into the hall and
challenged any man to say that Richard was not
King of England. No one, of course, ventured to
gainsay his title; but from every side rose shouts
of "King Richard, King Richard;" and, his inauguration
as sovereign of England having been thus
formally completed, the usurper retired to consider
how he could best secure himself on that throne
which he had gained by means so unscrupulous.



[Pg 423]




CHAPTER XLV.

THE PRINCES IN THE TOWER.


When the sons of the fourth Edward and Elizabeth
Woodville had been escorted through London,
conducted to the Tower, and given into the keeping
of Sir Robert Brackenbury, the populace saw their
faces no more.

According to the chroniclers who wrote in the
age of the Tudors, the young king had, from the
time of the arrest of his maternal kinsman at Stony
Stratford, been possessed with vague presentiments;
and he no sooner heard of the usurpation than he
revealed the alarm he felt for his personal safety.
"Alas!" exclaimed the boy, on being informed that
Richard was to be crowned, "I would mine uncle
would let me enjoy my life, though I lose my kingdom
and my crown."

The lives of the princes might have been spared;
but it happened that, after causing his coronation
to be celebrated with so much splendor at Westminster,
Richard undertook a progress to York, to have
the ceremony repeated in the capital of the north.
While on his way, Richard learned that the friends
of Elizabeth Woodville were conspiring to deliver[Pg 424]
the princes from the Tower, and to place young Edward
on the throne. The usurper, it is said, then
resolved on having his nephews put to death ere
they could be used by his enemies to disturb his
reign. With this view, while at Gloucester, Richard
dispatched a messenger, named John Green, to
Brackenbury, with instructions to make away with
the princes; but Brackenbury, though elevated to
office by Richard, declared that he must decline the
commission.

Richard was at Warwick when this answer
reached him; and, on hearing that Brackenbury
was a man who entertained scruples, he exclaimed,
with astonishment, "By St. Paul, whom then may
we trust?" He was determined, however, that the
deed should be done, and, while musing over the
matter, bethought him of his Master of the Horse,
Sir James Tyrrel, who was in the next room. This
man, a brother, it appears, of the knight of that
name who fell with Warwick at Barnet, was turbulent
in spirit, and so eager for preferment that, in
order to make his fortune, he would shrink from no
crime. When, therefore, summoned to the king's
presence, he showed himself even readier to execute
the murderous deed than Richard was to intrust
him with the commission.

"Would you venture to kill one of my friends?"
asked Richard.

[Pg 425]

"Yes, my lord," answered Tyrrel; "but I would
rather kill two of your enemies."

"By St. Paul!" exclaimed Richard, "that is the
very thing. I want to be free from dread of two
mortal foes in the Tower."

"Open the gates to me," said Tyrrel, "and you
will not need to fear them longer."

Richard, glad to have found a man capable of executing
his commission, gave Tyrrel letters to Brackenbury,
commanding that he should be intrusted
with the custody of the Tower and of the princes
for twenty-four hours. Armed with these letters,
Tyrrel hied him to London; and, having freed
Brackenbury for a while from the exercise of his
official functions, he enlisted in his service a man
named Miles Forrest, and a sturdy groom named
James Dighton. With the aid of these ruffians, and
the sole attendant of the princes, William Slaughter,
whom chroniclers call "Black Will," and emphatically
describe as a "bloody knave," Tyrrel prepared
for the murderous deed.

On a summer night       such is the story so often
told       the two princes were sleeping in an upper
chamber of the Tower, in that part of the gloomy
strong-hold still pointed out as "the Bloody Tower."
Their only attendant was "Black Will;" but, as
clasped in each other's arms they slept the sleep of
boyhood, their very innocence seemed a protection.[Pg 426]
While Tyrrel remained outside the door, Forrest and
Dighton suddenly stole into the room, prepared to
set about the work of murder. The spectacle presented
would have melted any other than the hardest
hearts; but Forrest and Dighton were so hardened
as to be impervious to emotions of pity, and they
proceeded to their task with a shocking brutality.
Wrapping the boys tightly in the coverlet, they
placed the pillows and feather bed over their mouths
till they were stifled; and then, seeing that their
innocent souls had departed, laid the bodies on the
bed, and intimated to their employer that all was
over.

Tyrrel, on hearing this, entered the room to see
with his own eyes that the horrid commission had
been faithfully executed. After satisfying himself
on this point, the unworthy knight ordered the
bodies of the murdered princes to be buried beneath
the stair, and hastened back to inform the
king that his nephews slept in Paradise.



[Pg 427]




CHAPTER XLVI.

A MOCK KING-MAKER.


Among the many men of high estate who aided
Richard to usurp the English throne, none played
a more conspicuous part than his rival in foppery,
Henry Stafford, Duke of Buckingham. No sooner,
however, had the Protector been converted into a
king than his confederate became malcontent and
restlessly eager for change. The death of Warwick,
the captivity of John de Vere, the extinction of the
Mowbrays and Beauforts, had left the duke one of
the most influential among English magnates then
alive and at liberty; and, albeit destitute of prowess
and intellect, he appears to have vainly imagined
that he could exercise that kind of influence which
had rendered Richard Neville so formidable. But,
capable as Buckingham might have deemed himself
of rivaling "The Stout Earl," who slept with his
Montagu ancestors in the Abbey of Bisham, he had
none of "the superb and more than regal pride"
which rendered the descendant of Cospatrick averse
to the gewgaws of royalty. The object of the duke's
ambition, when he resolved to break with the usurper,
appears to have been the crown which he had
helped to place on Richard's head.

[Pg 428]

With his shallow brain full of ambitious ideas,
and hardly deigning to conceal his discontent, Buckingham
took leave of Richard. On leaving the
court of Westminster, he turned his face toward his
castle of Brecknock, and by the way regaled his
fancy with splendid visions of crowns and sceptres.

It happened that, on the day before the coronation,
when Richard released the confederates of
Hastings from the Tower, he found John Morton,
Bishop of Ely, decidedly hostile to his pretensions.
Unable to gain the support of the prelate, but unwilling,
on such an occasion, to appear harsh, Richard
delivered him to Buckingham, to be sent to
Brecknock and gently guarded in that castle. At
Brecknock, musing over his experiences as parson
of Blokesworth, his expedition to Towton Field, his
exile to Verdun, and his promotion to the see of
Ely by a Yorkist king, Buckingham met the bishop
when he went thither awakened from his dream of
royalty, but panting for enterprise, however quixotic.
After so many exciting scenes       suppers at
Northampton, orations at the Guildhall, deputations
to Baynard's Castle, progresses through London,
and coronation banquets at Westminster       the
duke doubtless found Brecknock intolerably dull.
Feeling the want of company, he threw himself in
the bishop's way, and gradually surrendered himself
to the fascination of the wily churchman's conversation.[Pg 429]
The bishop, perceiving that envy was devouring
the duke's heart, worked craftily upon his
humor; and Buckingham, exposed to the influence
of one of the most adroit politicians of the age, by
degrees approached the subject which the bishop
was anxious to discuss.

"I fantasied," such were the duke's words, "that
if I list to take upon me the crown, now was the
time, when this tyrant was detested of all men, and
knowing not of any one that could pretend before
me. In this imagination I rested two days at
Tewkesbury. But, as I rode between Worcester
and Bridgenorth, I met with the Lady Margaret,
Countess of Richmond, now wife to the Lord Stanley,
who is the daughter and sole heir of John, Duke
of Somerset, my grandfather's elder brother (who
was as clean out of my mind as if I had never seen
her); so that she and her son, the Earl of Richmond,
have, both of them, titles before mine; and
then I clearly saw how I was deceived, whereupon
I determined utterly to relinquish all such fantastical
notions concerning the obtaining the crown myself."

The bishop listened eagerly, and doubtless felt
much relieved at this announcement. He had soon
more cause for gratification when Buckingham added,
"I find there can be no better way to settle the
crown than that the Earl of Richmond, very heir to[Pg 430]
the house of Lancaster, should take to wife Lady
Elizabeth, eldest daughter to King Edward, the very
heir of the house of York, so that the two Roses may
be united in one."

"Since by your grace's incomparable wisdom
this noble conjunction is now moved," exclaimed
the bishop, almost overcome with joy at the duke's
hitting "the mark he had himself aimed at" in forming
his projects, "it is in the next place necessary
to consider what friends we shall first make privy to
our intention."

"By my troth," said the duke, "we will begin
with the Countess of Richmond       the earl's mother       who
knows where he is in Brittany, and whether
a captive or at large."

The conspiracy originated at Brecknock rapidly
became formidable. Reginald Bray, a retainer of
the Countess of Richmond, was employed to open
the business to his mistress; and the countess, approving
of the project, commissioned her physician,
Dr. Lewis, to treat with Elizabeth Woodville in the
sanctuary.

Elizabeth interposed no obstacle to a project
which promised her daughter a throne; and Bray,
on finding that the negotiation had proved successful,
was enabled to draw many men of high rank
into the conspiracy. John, Lord Welles, true like
his ancestors to the Red Rose, prepared to draw his[Pg 431]
sword for Lancaster. Peter Courtenay, Bishop of
Exeter, and his brother Sir Edward, a man remarkable
for his elegance and destined to wed King Edward's
daughter Katherine, undertook to raise the
inhabitants of the western counties. Dorset, escaping
from the sanctuary, repaired to Yorkshire,
trusting to rouse the men of the north against the
usurper.

Buckingham meanwhile remained at Brecknock,
gathering the Welsh to his standard, and dreaming,
perhaps, of entering London as Warwick had entered
London thirteen years earlier. The duke, indeed,
seems to have had no conception of the hazard
to which he was exposing himself. He had been so
flattered that he believed himself hedged by the nobility
of his name. He had not the elevation of soul
to dream of a Barnet, and he had too much vanity
to entertain a prophetic vision of the crowded market-place,
the scaffold, and the block, which, with the
headsmen, awaited unsuccessful rebellion.



[Pg 432]




CHAPTER XLVII.

THE COMING MAN.


At the time when Richard usurped the English
throne, a young Welshman was residing at Vannes,
in Brittany. His age was thirty; his stature below
the middle height; his complexion fair; his eyes
gray; his hair yellow; and his countenance would
have been pleasing but for an expression indicative
of cunning and hypocrisy. It was Henry Tudor,
Earl of Richmond, grandson of Owen Tudor, and
sole heir of his mother, Margaret Beaufort, granddaughter
of John of Gaunt and Katherine Swynford.

While passing his time at Vannes, Richmond was
one day startled by the arrival of messengers with
intelligence that a conspiracy had been formed at
Brecknock to place him on the English throne, and
give him in marriage a young woman who belonged
to the house of York, which he had detested from
his cradle, and who, moreover, had the disadvantage
of being considered illegitimate. Richmond does
not appear to have received the proposals with enthusiasm,
and matters might never have been brought
to a satisfactory issue but for the arrival of the[Pg 433]
Bishop of Ely. The prelate, by his diplomacy, however,
removed all obstacles, and the Duke of Brittany,
on being consulted, promised to aid the enterprise.

At that period, Dr. Thomas Hutton, a man of
intellect and perception, was in Brittany as English
embassador, ostensibly to ascertain whether or not
Duke Francis gave any countenance to the Woodvilles,
but, doubtless, with secret instructions to defeat
the machinations of the exiles at Vannes. Hutton,
who had an eye to see and a brain to comprehend,
soon became aware of Buckingham's plot, and
endeavored to persuade the Duke of Brittany to detain
Richmond. But, when the duke, who was already
committed, declined to interfere, the embassador
sent such intelligence to England as enabled
Richard to form a clear notion of the conspiracy
formed to hurl him from the throne.

Nevertheless, Richmond, with forty ships and five
thousand Bretons, sailed from St. Malo. But his
voyage was the reverse of prosperous; and on the
very evening when the adventurers put to sea a violent
tempest dispersed the fleet. Only the ship
which carried Richmond, attended by a single bark,
held on her course, and reached the mouth of Poole
Harbor, on the coast of Dorset.

And now the Welsh earl had startling proof of
Hutton's vigilance. On approaching the English[Pg 434]
coast, Richmond perceived crowds of armed men,
and immediately suspected a snare. However, he
sent a boat ashore to ascertain whether they were
friends or foes, and his messengers returned with information
that the soldiers were friends, waiting to
escort him to Buckingham's camp. But Richmond,
too cautious to land with so slender a force in an
enemy's country, resolved on sailing back to St.
Malo. The wind being favorable, Richmond soon
came in sight of Normandy, and after a short stay
on that coast he returned to Brittany.

Meanwhile, Buckingham's insurrection began, and
in autumn Richmond was proclaimed king at various
places in England. At the same time, the
duke, at the head of a large body of Welshmen,
marched from his castle and moved toward the
Severn, his first object being to join the Courtenays.

Matters immediately assumed a gloomy aspect;
and Buckingham found that heading an insurgent
army was less agreeable than dancing with princesses
at Windsor, or displaying his gorgeous attire
before the citizens of London. While he was blundering
along the right bank of the Severn in search
of a ford, autumnal rains rendered every ford impassable;
and the river, rapidly overflowing its
banks, inundated the country around. A scene replete
with horrors was the consequence. Houses[Pg 435]
were overthrown; men were drowned in their beds;
children were carried about swimming in cradles;
and beasts of burden and beasts of prey were drowned
in the fields and on the hills. Such a flood had
never been experienced within the memory of man;
and, for centuries after, it was remembered along
the banks of the Severn as "the Duke of Buckingham's
water."

Buckingham was rudely awakened from his delusions.
The flooded river and broken bridges created
difficulties with which he could not cope. His
enterprise       from the beginning never very promising       became
utterly hopeless; and the Welshmen, losing
heart and finding no provision made for their
subsistence, turned their thoughts affectionately to
the rude homes and the rude fare they had left behind.
The result soon appeared. The Celtic warriors
pretended to regard the flood as a sign that the
insurrection was displeasing to Heaven, deserted their
standards in crowds, and, without exception, returned
to their mountains.

Buckingham now lost courage; and, while his confederates       Dorset,
the Courtenays, Lord Welles, Sir
William Brandon, and Sir John Cheyney       escaped
to Richmond in Brittany, the duke fled to Shrewsbury,
and took refuge in the house of one of his retainers,
named Humphrey Bannister. Tempted by
the reward offered for Buckingham's apprehension,[Pg 436]
Bannister betrayed his master; and the duke, having
been conveyed to Salisbury, was beheaded, without
trial, in the market-place.

When the conspiracy of Brecknock had been
crushed, Richard summoned a Parliament, which
declared him lawful sovereign, entailed the crown
on his son, and passed a bill of attainder against
those who had taken part in Buckingham's attempt
at king-making. Nevertheless, Richard did not feel
secure. The dread of an invasion, and of his enemies
uniting Richmond and Elizabeth, kept the
usurper uneasy, and he set himself boldly to the
scheme of getting both the Welsh earl and the English
princess in his power. The persons who could
aid him in this were Peter Landois and Elizabeth
Woodville.

The Duke of Brittany now reigned no longer save
in name, and Peter Landois       son of a tailor       ruled
the province with more than ducal power. Peter,
though elevated to so high a position, was not proof
to the temptation of a bribe; and Richard, by means
of gold, converted him from a friend to an enemy
of Richmond, and obtained his promise to send the
Welsh earl a prisoner into England.

With Elizabeth Woodville Richard was equally
successful. That lady, weary of the sanctuary, not
only listened to his proposals, but went with her
daughters to court, where Elizabeth, the eldest, was[Pg 437]
treated with the utmost distinction. Richard is supposed
to have intended to match the princess with
his son, a boy of eleven, but the death of the prince
at Middleham defeated this plan for reconciling conflicting
claims.

No sooner, however, had Richard recovered from
the grief caused by the death of his son, than he
formed a new scheme for keeping Elizabeth in his
family. His queen, the Anne Neville of other days,
was in feeble health; and Richard, under the impression
that she could not live long, determined to
obtain a dispensation from Rome, and marry the
princess.

Neither mother nor daughter appear to have objected
to this scandalous project. Elizabeth Woodville
wrote to the Marquis of Dorset to abandon
Richmond's cause, as she had formed a better plan
for her family; and Elizabeth of York, at the instigation
of her mother, no doubt, wrote to Sir John
Howard, now Duke of Norfolk, expressing her surprise
that the queen should be so long in dying.

At length, in March, 1485, Anne Neville breathed
her last, and Richard consulted Catesby and Ratcliffe
as to the policy of espousing Elizabeth. Both
protested against the project, declaring that such a
marriage would shock both clergy and populace, and
would, moreover, alienate the men of the north,
hitherto so faithful to Richard as the husband of[Pg 438]
Lord Warwick's daughter. Richard, convinced,
banished all thought of marrying Elizabeth; and,
having sent her for security to the Castle of Sheriff
Hutton, he prepared to encounter the coming
man.



[Pg 439]




CHAPTER XLVIII.

FROM BRITTANY TO BOSWORTH.


On Christmas day, 1483, a memorable scene was
enacted in the capital of Brittany. On that day,
Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond, appeared in the
Cathedral of Rennes; before the high altar, and in
the presence of the Marquis of Dorset and many
other exiles the Welsh earl swore, in the event of
being placed on the English throne, to espouse Elizabeth
of York, and thereupon the marquis, with the
other lords and knights, did him homage as to their
sovereign. On the same day Richmond and the
English exiles took the sacrament, and bound themselves
by oath never to desist from making war
against King Richard till they accomplished his destruction
or his dethronement.

Within twelve months after this solemn ceremony,
and while Richmond was musing over his prospects,
his mother's chaplain one day arrived with a message
to the effect that the Welsh earl was no longer
safe in Brittany; and, after considering the matter,
Richmond resolved upon an escape, and prepared to
be gone. With this view he announced his intention
to visit a friend in a neighboring village, and, without[Pg 440]
delay, mounted his horse as if to proceed on the
way thither. After riding five miles, however, he
entered a wood, and hastily exchanged clothes with
one of his servants. Having assumed the character
of a valet, Richmond again mounted, and traveling
by by-paths without halting, save to bait the horses,
he reached Angers, and, accompanied by the exiled
lords, pursued his way to the court of France.

Events had recently occurred at the French court
which secured Richmond a favorable reception. In
the summer of 1483, Louis the Crafty had drawn
his last breath, his son Charles then being a boy of
thirteen. A struggle for power began between the
young king's sister Anne, wife of the Sire de Beaujieu,
and Louis, Duke of Orleans, heir-presumptive
to the throne. Orleans, it seems, had formed an
alliance with Richard; and Anne, from considerations
of policy, determined to assist Richmond.

At Paris, therefore, Richmond was received with
distinction; and, ere long, Anne, in the young king's
name, agreed to furnish him with money and men
to undertake an expedition against the King of England.
Richmond then commenced preparations for
the great adventure.

Matters, however, did not go quite smoothly; and
Dorset, despairing, resolved to avail himself of Elizabeth
Woodville's invitation; and, with this view,
the marquis, who, though young, appears to have[Pg 441]
been false and calculating as his mother, forgot his
oath in the Cathedral of Rennes, and left Paris secretly
by night. His disappearance caused some
consternation; for, though in most respects a man
of arms would have been a greater loss, he was possessed
of information which, conveyed to Richard,
would have ruined every thing. Humphrey Cheyney,
one of Sir John's brothers, was therefore dispatched
in pursuit, and succeeded in bringing the
renegade back to Paris.

Ere the escape of the marquis, Richmond had
been joined by an Englishman whose presence lent
dignity to the enterprise, and would have more than
compensated for the loss of five hundred Dorsets.

A long and weary captivity, during which his
only son had died in the Tower, and his wife lived
by needle-work, had not broken the spirit of Oxford's
earl. John De Vere was still ready for adventure;
and no sooner did he learn that the partisans
of the Red Rose were in motion, than, becoming
eager to leave Hammes, he tried his eloquence
on James Blount, captain of the fortress. Oxford's
success was more signal than he anticipated. Won,
and touched with admiration at the degree of courage
that animated the earl after so long a captivity,
Blount not only consented to set Oxford at liberty,
but offered to accompany him to Richmond, and
place the fortress at the adventurer's service. They[Pg 442]
went; and Richmond was delighted to have such a
castle as Hammes at his disposal, and such a patrician
as John De Vere at his right hand.

All that could be done in Paris having been accomplished,
Richmond put Dorset in pledge for the
money he had borrowed, and left the court of Paris
for Harfleur. Having made all preparations, he and
his English friends embarked, with a few pieces of
artillery and about three thousand men, collected
from the jails and hospitals of Normandy and Brittany,
and described by Comines as "the loosest and
most profligate fellows of all the country." On the
last day of July, 1485       it was a Sunday       the armament,
leaving the mouth of the Seine, put to sea,
and Richmond ordered the mariners to steer for
Wales. The voyage was free from such disasters as
attended Richmond's former expedition; and, after
having been six days at sea, the adventurers sailed
safely into Milford Haven. At the grand national
harbor, which gives importance to that part of South
Wales, Richmond debarked his soldiers without
challenge.

On the morning of Sunday, the 21st of August,
about three weeks after his landing, Richmond, having
marched from Milford Haven without a check,
encamped in Leicestershire at a place then known in
the locality as Whitemoors, and erected his standard
on the margin of a rivulet now known in the locality[Pg 443]
as the Tweed. To the north of Richmond's camp
was a morass, and beyond the morass a spacious
plain nearly surrounded by hills. At the farthest
verge of these hills, about three miles north from
the camp, but concealed from view by the elevated
ground that intervened, was a little town, to which
the inhabitants of that part of Leicestershire were
long in the habit of repairing weekly to market.
Since that time, however, the name of that market-town
has become famous as the scene of a great
battle, which destroyed a dynasty and overturned a
throne. It was Bosworth.



[Pg 444]




CHAPTER XLIX.

RICHARD BEFORE BOSWORTH.


While Oxford was leaving Hammes, and Richmond
was at Paris maturing his projects, and Reginald
Bray was carrying messages from the English
malcontents to the Welsh earl, the king appears to
have been unaware of the magnitude of his danger.

Richard was not, however, the man to be surprised
by armed foemen in the recesses of a palace.
No sooner did he hear of an armament at the mouth
of the Seine, than Lord Lovel was stationed at
Southampton, Sir John Savage commissioned to
guard the coasts of Cheshire, and Rice ap Thomas
intrusted with the defense of Wales. At the same
time, Richard issued a proclamation, describing
Richmond as "one Henry Tudor, descended of
bastard blood both by father's and mother's side;"
who could have no claim to the crown but by conquest;
who had agreed to give up Calais to France;
and who intended to subvert the ancient laws and
liberties of England.

Having thus endeavored to excite the patriotism
of the populace, Richard, about midsummer, set up
his standard at Nottingham, and around it, with the[Pg 445]
Earl of Northumberland at their head, came the
men of the north in thousands. While keeping his
state in Nottingham Castle, Richard heard of Richmond's
landing at Milford Haven, and soon after
learned, with indignation, that Rice ap Thomas had
proved false; that Sir Gilbert Talbot, with two
thousand retainers of his nephew, the young Earl
of Shrewsbury, had joined the invaders; that, after
leaving Shrewsbury, Richmond had pursued his way
through Newport to Stafford, and from Stafford to
Lichfield, and that men were rapidly gathering to
his standard. Vowing vengeance, the king issued
orders that his army should forthwith march southward
to Leicester.

Meanwhile, many of the lords whom Richard had
summoned did not appear; and Lord Stanley, feeling
that he, as husband of the Countess of Richmond,
was peculiarly liable to suspicion, sent to say
that sickness alone kept him from his sovereign's
side at such a crisis. But this apology did not
prove satisfactory; and Richard having Stanley's
son, Lord Strange, in the camp, ordered him to be
secured, and made it understood that the son's life
depended on the sire's loyalty.

It was the evening of Tuesday, the 16th of August,
when Richard, mounted on a tall white charger, environed
by his guard and followed by his infantry,
entered Leicester; and as the castle was too much[Pg 446]
dilapidated to accommodate a king, he was lodged
in one of those antique edifices, half brick, half
timber, that have gradually given way to modern
buildings. In a room of this house, long known as
"The old Blue Boar," Richard slept during his stay
at Leicester on a remarkable bedstead of wood,
which had a false bottom, and served him as a military
chest. After the battle of Bosworth this
strange piece of furniture was found to contain a
large sum of money, and it was long preserved in
Leicester as a memorial of King Richard's visit to
that city.

While Richard was at Leicester, fighting men
came in to his aid. There he was joined by John
Howard, Duke of Norfolk, by Thomas, Earl of Surrey,
by Lord Lovel, and by Sir Robert Brackenbury.
But with them came farther tidings of desertion;
for at Stony Stratford, Sir Walter Hungerford
and Sir Thomas Bourchier, son of Sir Humphrey,
who fell at Barnet, feeling that they were not trusted,
deserted Brackenbury, and       much as they owed
to Richard       went straight to Richmond's camp.

Nevertheless, the king's courage continued high;
and on the morning of Sunday, the 21st, having, it
would appear, been previously out of the city looking
for his foes, he rode from Leicester toward Market
Bosworth, in the hope of an early meeting. On the
way, it was necessary for him to pass over Bow[Pg 447]
Bridge, which crossed the Stoure on the west side
of the town. Upon this bridge, according to tradition,
was a stone of such height that, in riding by,
Richard happened to strike it with his spur. An
old woman, who was supposed to practice, in a
humble way, the arts which the populace associated
with the names of Friar Bungey and the Duchess
of Bedford, thereupon shook her head, and on being
asked what would be the king's fortune, she answered,
"Where his spur struck, there shall his head be
broken."

After marching about eight miles, Richard came
in sight of Richmond's army, and encamped for the
day near the Abbey of Miraville. In the evening,
however, he moved forward to within a mile of the
town of Bosworth, and posted his army strongly on
Amyon Hill, an acclivity with a steep descent on
all sides, but steepest toward the north, or Bosworth
side, and least so toward the south, where, with a
morass intervening, Richmond's army lay. Lord
Stanley still remained at Stapleton. His brother,
Sir William Stanley, had not yet arrived.

When that August day drew to a close, and darkness
concealed the hostile armies from each other's
view, Richard retired to rest. Repose, however, was
not granted, so disturbed were his slumbers and so
alarming his dreams; and at daybreak he had farther
evidence of the spirit of treachery that prevailed[Pg 448]
in his camp. During the night, Sir John
Savage, Sir Simon Digby, and Sir Brian Sandford
had gone over to Richmond. The desertion of Savage
was of no slight consequence, for he was Lord
Stanley's nephew, and he led the men of Cheshire.

Nor was the desertion of Savage, Digby, and
Sandford the most alarming incident. A mysterious
warning in rhyme, attached, during the night,
to the tent of the new Duke of Norfolk,[16] seemed
to intimate that the king's prospects were worse
than they yet seemed; for still, to all appearance,
Richard's army was comparatively formidable. It
was not merely by Brackenbury, and by Catesby,
Ratcliffe, and Lovel, whose names had been rendered
familiar by Collingborn's rhyme, that the usurper
found himself surrounded on that memorable morning.
On the king's side, Northumberland still remained,
somewhat reserved, perhaps, but raising no
suspicion of the treachery of which he was about to
be guilty. On the king's side, also, appeared John,
Lord Zouche, and Walter Devereux, Lord Ferrers
of Chartley, and Sir Gervase Clifton, albeit the son
of the Lancastrian executed after Tewkesbury. And
not the least conspicuous, decked out in the trappings
of the Mowbrays, and reminding contemporaries
of the jackass in the lion's skin, figured Sir[Pg 449]
John Howard, for once in his life acting with honesty,
and prepared to prove his gratitude for the
dukedom he had long coveted.

All this time, however, the intentions of Lord
Stanley were doubtful. Hitherto the wary baron
had kept his counsel so well that even his own
brother, who had come with three thousand men
from Stafford, and encamped to the king's right,
was unaware of his intentions.

When, however, the morning advanced, and the
hostile armies prepared for battle, and Lord Stanley,
moving slowly forward, posted his men midway
between the two armies, Richard lost temper, and
resolved to try the influence of a menace. He therefore
sent a pursuivant-at-arms to command Lord
Stanley's attendance, and to intimate that he had
sworn by Christ's passion, in case of not being
obeyed, to strike off Lord Strange's head. Lord
Stanley, however, remained resolute. "If the king
cut off Strange's head," said the grim baron, "I have
more sons alive. He may do his pleasure; but to
come to him I am not now determined." Enraged
at this answer, Richard ordered Strange to be led
forth to execution; but his advisers agreed that it
was better to keep the prisoner till after the battle.
"It was now," they said, "the time to fight, not to
execute;" and Richard, perhaps thinking that, while
the son's life hung in the balance, there was a chance[Pg 450]
of the father repeating the part so well played at
Bloreheath, placed Strange in the custody of his
tent-keeper, and girded on his armor for a great
struggle to retain the crown he had usurped.

And who can doubt that, in such an hour, other
than selfish motives animated the last Plantagenet
king? With all his faults, Richard was an Englishman,
and a man of genius; and his patriotism and
his pride must have been shocked at the possibility
of the throne, from which the first and the third Edward
had commanded the respect of Europe, becoming
the perch of an adventurer, who would never
have been heard of but for a Welsh soldier having
made too elaborate a pirouette while enacting the
part of court fool.



[Pg 451]




CHAPTER L.

BOSWORTH FIELD.


It was the morning of Monday, the 22d of August,
1485, when the Yorkist usurper and the Lancastrian
adventurer mustered their forces on the field of Bosworth,
and prepared for that conflict which decided
the thirty years' War of the Roses.

On the eve of a struggle which subsequent events
rendered so memorable, Richard was not quite himself.
For days his temper had been frequently tried
by news of desertion, and for nights his rest had been
broken by dreams of disaster. Nevertheless, he prepared
for battle with energy. The honor of leading
the van, which was constituted of archers, flanked
with cuirassiers, fell to the Duke of Norfolk, and
his son the Earl of Surrey. The main battle, consisting
of choice bill-men, empaled with pikes, and
formed into a dense square, with wings of cavalry
on either side, the king took under his own auspices.
The rear-guard was under the command of Northumberland.
Besides, Richard's artillery was the reverse
of contemptible; and, altogether, he had little
to fear save from the treachery of his adherents.

Richmond, meantime, growing uneasy in the presence[Pg 452]
of a foe so redoubted, sent to ask Lord Stanley
to come and assist him in marshaling his army.
The answer of the Countess of Richmond's husband
was not quite satisfactory to his step-son. Indeed,
Stanley gave the messenger to understand that no
aid need be expected from him till the armies joined
battle, and he only committed himself so far as to
advise that the onset should be made without delay.

Richmond was staggered at Stanley's answer.
The Welsh earl's situation was indeed painful and
perplexing. He knew that his army was scarcely
half so numerous as the king's, and he could not
but be conscious of his immeasurable inferiority as
a general. Retreat, however, was impossible; and,
after holding a council of war, Richmond resolved
on fighting forthwith. This resolution having been
arrived at, the Lancastrian army was set in order
for battle. Oxford took the command of the van,
which consisted principally of archers. Richmond       whose
standard was borne by Sir William Brandon       undertook
to command the main body; and in his
rear, with a body of horsemen and some bills and
pikes, was posted Jasper Tudor, whose age and experience,
it was probably hoped, would compensate
in some measure for his nephew's lack of military
skill and prowess. Besides, Richmond's army had
two wings. Of these one was commanded by Sir
Gilbert Talbot, the other by Sir John Savage.

[Pg 453]

His preparations made, and his armor girded on
except the helmet, Richmond, to encourage his army,
rode from rank to rank, and many of the Lancastrian
soldiers for the first time saw the man who
represented himself as the heir of John of Gaunt.
The aspect of the adventurer must have disappointed
those who had pictured, in imagination, such a
chief as the conqueror of Towton and Tewkesbury.
Nature had denied Richmond kingly proportions;
and his appearance, though not positively mean,
was far from majestic; while his countenance wore
an expression which indicated too clearly that tendency
to knavery destined to be so rapidly developed.

After riding along his lines, Richmond halted,
and from an elevated part of the field addressed to
his army one of those battle-field orations which
were in fashion at the period. Dealing with such
topics as were most likely to inflame his partisans
against the usurper, he was listened to with sympathy;
and perceiving, as he pronounced the words,
"Get this day, and be conquerors; lose the battle,
and be slaves," that an impression had been produced,
he added, "In the name of God, then, and
of St. George, let every man advance his banner."
At these words Sir William Brandon raised the
Tudor's standard; the trumpets sounded an onset;
and Richmond, keeping the morass to his right, led[Pg 454]
the Lancastrians, with the sun on their backs, slowly
up the ascent toward Amyon Hill.

Ere this, Richard had mounted his tall steed       the
White Surrey of Shakspeare       ascended an eminence,
since known as "Dickon's Mount," called
his captains together, and addressed them as his
"most faithful and assured friends." The speech,
not unworthy of one whom his enemies confess to
have been "a king jealous of the honor of England,"
elicited some degree of enthusiasm; but Richard
must have sighed as he recalled to memory how enthusiastic,
in comparison, had been the burst of
sympathy which rose from Edward's soldiers on the
field of Barnet. The bold usurper, however, appeared
undismayed. "Let every one," he said in
conclusion, "strike but one sure blow, and certainly
the day will be ours. Wherefore, advance banners,
sound trumpets; St. George be our aid; and God
grant us victory!"

As the king concluded, and placed his helmet,
with a crown of ornament, on his brow, the Yorkists
raised a shout, sounded trumpets, and moved
down the hill; and, with banners flying and plumes
waving, the hostile armies came hand to hand.

The day opened not inauspiciously for Richard.
His army would be little inferior to that of his adversaries
even should Stanley join Richmond; and
his position on Amyon Hill had been selected with[Pg 455]
judgment. Moreover, to intimidate and outflank
the foe, he had extended his van to an unusual
length, and this artifice proved so far successful, at
least, that Oxford was somewhat dismayed at the
danger that threatened his scanty ranks.

Oxford, however, was a leader of extraordinary
calibre. He had not, indeed, seen many fields, but
to him Barnet had been worth thirty years of experience
to men not gifted with the military genius
which rendered the Anglo-Norman barons such formidable
war-chiefs. Over the events of that disastrous
day the earl may be supposed to have mused
for twelve years in his prison at Hammes, and to
have learned, in sadness and solitude, wholesome
lessons for his guidance in the event of being again
called to encounter the warriors of the White Rose.
The day had now arrived, and John De Vere was
resolved not to be outwitted either by "Jocky of
Norfolk" or "Dickon his master."

No sooner did Oxford's men come to close encounter
with those under Norfolk, than the earl saw
that he was exposed to danger. Without loss of
time, he issued orders that no soldier should move
ten yards from his colors. Their leader's motive
not being understood, the men hurriedly closed their
ranks and ceased from fighting; and the enemy,
suspicious of some stratagem, likewise drew back
from the conflict. Oxford quickly availed himself[Pg 456]
of this pause in the battle, and, placing his men in
the form of a wedge, he made a furious attack on
the foe. At the same time, Lord Stanley, who,
when the armies moved, had placed himself on
Richmond's right hand to oppose the front of the
royal van, charged with ardor; and Norfolk would
have been exposed to a danger similar to that from
which Oxford had just been freed, if, while Oxford
was forming the Lancastrian van into a wedge,
Richard had not arrayed anew that of the Yorkists       placing
thin lines in front, and supporting them
by dense masses.

Both armies having thus been re-formed, proceeded
with the battle. But it soon appeared that, however
equal the antagonistic forces might be in number,
the zeal was all on the side of the Red Rose.
Moreover, Northumberland, who commanded the
rear       one third of Richard's army       refrained from
taking any part whatever in the conflict; and futile
proved the king's expectation of aid from the potent
northern earl.

The battle had not been long joined ere the field
wore an aspect most unfavorable to Richard. Norfolk,
indeed, fought resolutely in the van; but, outnumbered
and hard-pressed by Oxford and Stanley,
he was slowly but surely giving way; and the men
composing the king's division exerted themselves
faintly, and exhibited little of such enthusiasm as[Pg 457]
might have carried them on to victory against superior
numbers.

Amid the smoke of artillery and the roar of battle,
Sir Robert Brackenbury and Sir Walter Hungerford
met face to face.

"Traitor," exclaimed Brackenbury, "what caused
you to desert me?"

"I will not answer you with words," said Hungerford,
taking aim at the head of his ancient comrade.

The blow would have been fatal; but Brackenbury
received its force on his shield, which was
shivered in protecting its owner's head; and Hungerford,
perceiving his antagonist's defenseless plight,
chivalrously declared that they should fight on equal
terms, and handed his own shield to a squire. The
combat was then renewed, and both knights exerted
their utmost strength. At length Brackenbury's
helmet was battered to pieces, and his adversary's
weapon inflicted a severe wound. "Spare his life,
brave Hungerford," cried Sir Thomas Bourchier,
coming up; "he was our friend, and he may be so
again." But it was already too late to save the
wounded knight. As Bourchier spoke, Brackenbury
fell lifeless to the ground.

In another part of the field met Sir John Byron
and Sir Gervase Clifton. The two knights were
neighbors in the county of Nottingham, and, before[Pg 458]
embracing opposite sides, had made a singular contract.
Byron, who donned the Red Rose, agreed,
in the event of Richmond being victor, to intercede
for the heirs of Clifton; and Clifton, who assumed
the White Rose, promised, in case of Richard's success,
to exercise his utmost influence on behalf of
Byron's family. Byron, seeing Clifton fall, instantly
pressed forward to save him; and, sustaining his
wounded friend on a shield, entreated him to surrender.
Clifton opened his eyes, recognized his
neighbor, and recalled their agreement to memory.
"All is over with me," he said, faintly; "but remember
your promise." Byron pressed the hand
of Clifton as the Yorkist warrior expired, and he
kept the promise so faithfully that Clifton's estates
remained in possession of his children.

About this time Richard rode out of the battle,
and dismounted to quench his thirst at a spring of
water on Amyon Hill, now covered with a pyramid
of rough stones, indicated by Dr. Parr's inscription
in Roman letters, and pointed out to strangers as
"King Richard's Well;" and Catesby and other of
the usurper's friends, believing defeat inevitable,
brought one of those fleet steeds which, on such
occasions, seldom failed their riders.

"The field is lost, but the king can yet be saved,"
they said as the war-cries, reaching their ears through
the roar of bombards and the din of battle, intimated[Pg 459]
that Oxford and Stanley were overmatching the
Howards, and that, ere long, the shout would be
"Richmond and victory."

"Mount, my lord," said Catesby; "I hold it time
for you to fly. Stanley's dints are so sore that
against them can no man stand. Fly! Another
day we may worship again."

"Fly!" exclaimed Richard. "By St. Paul, not
one foot. I will either make an end of all battles
this day, or finish my life on this field. I will die
King of England."

His determination thus expressed, Richard mounted
his charger, hastily closed his visor, and again
faced the field. By this time it appeared that the
day would be decided by the vans. Richard, not
altogether willing to stake his crown on the generalship
of the Howards, spurred from his right centre
to see how the conflict went; and, at the same
moment, Richmond, surrounded by his guard, left
his main body, and rode forward to encourage the
men under Oxford and Stanley. Thus it happened
that the king and the Welsh earl came in sight of
each other; and no sooner was Richard aware of
Richmond being within reach, than the temptation
to single out the hostile leader became too strong to
be resisted.

And never during the battles of the Roses       neither
in the mist at Barnet, nor in the sunshine at[Pg 460]
Tewkesbury       had Richard made himself so formidable
as in that hour. With his lance in rest, and
followed by choice warriors, he dashed toward the
spot where the banner borne by Sir William Brandon
indicated Richmond's presence. The white
war-steed, the gorgeous armor, the crown of ornament,
rendered Richard conspicuous as he spurred
forward, and fierce was the onset as he charged
among the knights who clustered around the Lancastrian
chief. Vain were all efforts to bar his progress.
Richmond's standard was trampled in the
dust; Sir William Brandon, pierced with a mortal
wound, fell never more to rise; Sir John Cheyney,
throwing his bulky form in Richard's path,
was hurled from his horse; and the Welsh earl, all
unused to the game of carnage, was in the utmost
peril. His destruction, indeed, appeared inevitable.
The Lancastrian warriors, however, spurred to the
rescue, and shielded the adventurer's head from the
usurper's hand.

But most doubtful now was the issue of the conflict.
The desperate charge of Richard had created
a panic among his foes, and there was some prospect
of Richmond having to choose between dying bravely
and flying cravenly, when a circumstance, not unexpected,
changed the aspect of the field.

Sir William Stanley had hitherto remained a spectator
of the fight. Having ever been a devoted[Pg 461]
Yorkist, perhaps the gallant knight, hating Richard
as he did, was not eager to draw the sword for Lancaster
against a Yorkist, even though a usurper.
When, however, Richard's triumph was likely to result
from his inaction, Stanley came with a shout to
Richmond's aid; and this accession of force to the
Lancastrians so completely turned the scale, that no
chance of victory remained for Richard, unless, indeed,
the chief of the Percies should lead the tall
Danes of the north to the rescue.

But Stanley charged on, and the conflict became
a rout; and the Yorkist warriors, attacked with
energy, gave way in a body; and, still, Northumberland
maintained his position, and, having ordered
his soldiers to throw down their weapons, stood
motionless while fliers and pursuers swept by.

Lord Lovel and other Yorkists of name made their
escape. But, as at Barnet and Tewkesbury, so also
at Bosworth, men of high spirit disdained to fly or
yield. John Howard, Duke of Norfolk, fighting in
the van, redeemed a mean life by a not inglorious
death; Walter, Lord Ferrers, died with courage, as
he had lived with honor; and Sir Richard Ratcliffe
partially wiped away his disgrace by falling bravely
for the sovereign whom he had too faithfully served.
Lord Surrey and Sir William Catesby were taken
on the field. Northumberland quietly surrendered.

Richard now felt that he was face to face with
his destiny; and, in the hour of defeat and despair,[Pg 462]
he did not shrink from the fate he had defied. Indeed,
the valor he displayed in his last moments excited
admiration even in adversaries. Rising in his
stirrups as he saw his standard-bearer cut down,
and shouting loudly that he had been betrayed, the
usurper spurred into the midst of his foes, and made
his sword ring on helmet and shield. Not till unhorsed
did he cease to fight desperately. Even
then, his shield broken, his armor bruised, and the
crown of ornament hewn from his helmet, Richard
continued to struggle. At length, exhausted with
fatigue, and pierced with many wounds, he died
disdainfully, with the word "Treason" on his
tongue.

Ere the warriors of the Red Rose had time to
moralize over the fall of the last Plantagenet king,
Richmond, unwounded in the dreadful scene with
which the conflict closed, and feeling like a man
saved from imminent peril of drowning, threw himself
on his knees, and returned thanks to God for
victory. Then he rose, and expressed gratitude to
those who had aided him in his enterprise; and
Reginald Bray, bringing Richard's crown from a
bush, on which that ornament had been hung, handed
it to Lord Stanley, and Stanley placed it on the
victor's head; and the soldiers cried, "Long live
Henry the Seventh;" and the monarchy of the
Plantagenets ceased to exist.

CHAPTER LI.

AFTER BOSWORTH.


When the battle of Bosworth was over, and
Richmond, with John De Vere, and Jasper of Pembroke,
and the Stanleys, including Lord Strange,
stood around the mangled corpse of Richard, the
prisoners were brought before the victor. Among
them appeared William Catesby, and the Earls of
Surrey and Northumberland.

Northumberland was readily received into favor.
Surrey, when asked how he durst bear arms for the
usurper, answered, "If the Parliament of England
set the crown upon a bush, I would fight for it."
Richmond was softened by this speech, and Surrey
was spared to fight for the Tudors at Flodden, and
to wear the ducal coronet of the Mowbrays. Catesby,
less fortunate than the two earls, was summarily
executed. Dr. Hutton, who, according to tradition,
was one of "the Huttons of that Ilk," sought
safety north of the Tweed.

From Bosworth Richmond marched to Leicester,
and thither, covered with blood and dust, hung
across a horse, behind a pursuivant-at-arms, the feet[Pg 466]
dangling on one side and the hands on the other, the
body of King Richard was carried. As the mangled
corpse was conveyed over Bow Bridge, the
head dashed violently against the stone which Richard
had, the day before, struck with his spur       "thus,"
say the old chroniclers, "fulfilling the prediction
of the wise woman."

After being exposed to view in the Town Hall of
Leicester, Richard's body was buried in the Grey
Friars' Church, and Richmond slowly advanced toward
London. At Hornsey Wood he was met and
welcomed by the mayor and aldermen, all clad in
violet. Having been escorted to St. Paul's, he returned
thanks to God for his victory, and offered
three standards upon the high altar.

After some delay, Richmond appointed the 30th
of October, 1485, for his coronation; and on that
day the old Archbishop of Canterbury anointed the
adventurer, as two years earlier he had anointed the
usurper. All the ancient ceremonies were observed;
and Richmond availed himself of the occasion to elevate
Lord Stanley to the Earldom of Derby, Sir
Edward Courtenay to the Earldom of Devon, and
Jasper Tudor to the Dukedom of Bedford       the old
duchess, Elizabeth Woodville's mother, having gone
to her account at the time when peace and prosperity
surrounded the throne of her son-in-law,
and when William Caxton was setting up his[Pg 467]
printing-press under the patronage of the White
Rose.[17]

A week after Richmond's coronation Parliament
assembled at Westminster. Richard's adherents
were declared traitors, while De Vere, De Roos,
Beaumont, Welles, and others were restored; and
the heir of the Cliffords, who had passed his youth
in the garb of a shepherd, emerged at thirty from
the fells of Cumberland, and lived to lead the men
of the Craven to Flodden Field.

But of all who suffered during the Yorkist domination,
no one was so harshly treated as the widow
of "The Stout Earl," who fell on Gladsmuir Heath,
fighting for the ancient rights and liberties of Englishmen.
After having heard of Warwick's death,
the countess took refuge in the sanctuary of Beaulieu,
and there remained in poverty. On Richmond's
accession, however, an Act of Parliament
was passed to restore her manors. But this, it
would seem, was done that she might convey them
to the king, and only that of Sutton was allotted for
her maintenance.

[Pg 468]

From the day when Edward, Prince of Wales,
perished in his teens at Tewkesbury, Margaret of
Anjou ceased to influence the controversy with
which her name is inseparably associated.

Margaret lived several years after regaining her
freedom; and, deprived of the crown which her accomplishments
had won, the Lancastrian queen wandered
sadly from place to place, as if driven by her
perturbed spirit to seek something that was no longer
to be found.

Tortured by avenging memory, embittered by unavailing
regret, and weary of life, Margaret of Anjou
summed up her experience of the world when
she wrote in the breviary of her niece, "Vanity of
vanities, all is vanity." At length, in August, 1480,
the disconsolate queen, after reaching the age of
twoscore and ten, breathed her last at Damprierre,
and was buried by the side of her father in the
Cathedral of Angers.



[Pg 469]




CHAPTER LII.

THE UNION OF THE TWO ROSES.


At the time of the battle of Bosworth the eldest
daughter of Edward of York and Elizabeth Woodville
was immured in the Castle of Sheriff Hutton,
within the walls of which her cousin, Edward Plantagenet,
was also secure. After Richmond's victory
both were removed to London: Elizabeth of York
by high and mighty dames, to be restored to the
arms of her mother; Edward of Warwick by a
band of hireling soldiers, to be delivered into the
hands of a jailer and imprisoned in the Tower.[18]

It soon appeared that Richmond was not particularly
eager to wed the Yorkist princess. He was
not, however, to escape a marriage. When Parliament
met, and the king sat on the throne, and the[Pg 470]
Commons presented a grant of tonnage and poundage
for life, they plainly requested that he would
marry Elizabeth of York; and the lords, spiritual
and temporal, bowed to indicate their concurrence
in the prayer. Richmond, perceiving that there
was no way by which to retreat, replied that he
was ready and willing to take the princess to wife.

The marriage of Henry Tudor and Elizabeth of
York was fixed for the 18th of January, 1486, and
the ceremony was performed at Westminster. The
primate, soon to be laid in his grave and succeeded
by the Bishop of Ely, officiated on the occasion, and
every thing went joyously. The knights and nobles
of England exhibited their bravery at a grand tournament;
the citizens of London feasted and danced;
the populace sang songs and lighted bonfires; the
claims of the King of Portugal, the heir of John of
Gaunt, and the existence of Edward Plantagenet,
Earl of Warwick, the heir of Lionel of Clarence,
were conveniently forgotten; and the marriage of
a spurious Lancastrian prince and an illegitimate
daughter of York was celebrated by poets and
chroniclers as "The Union of the two Roses."

THE END.



FOOTNOTES.



[1] "Edward the First hath justly been styled the English
Justinian. For, in his time, the law did receive so sudden
a perfection, that Sir Matthew Hale does not scruple to affirm
that more was done in the first thirteen years of his
reign to settle and establish the distributive justice of the
kingdom than in all the ages since that time put together....
It was from this period that the liberty of England
began to rear its head."       Blackstone's Commentaries.



[2] "Lionel of Clarence married Elizabeth, daughter of
William de Burgh, Earl of Ulster, and had a daughter,
Philippa, wife of Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March. John
of Gaunt was thrice married. His first wife was Blanche,
heiress of Lancaster, by whom he had a son, Henry the
Fourth, and two daughters       Philippa, married to the King
of Portugal, and Elizabeth, to John Holland, Duke of Exeter.
His second wife was Constance, eldest daughter of
Peter the Cruel, King of Castile, by whom he had a daughter,
Katherine, married to Henry the Third, King of Castile.
His third wife was Katherine Swynford, by whom he
had two sons       Henry Beaufort, Cardinal of St. Eusebius and
Bishop of Winchester, and John Beaufort, Earl of Somerset,
ancestor of the dukes who fought in the Wars of the
Roses, and of Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond,
mother of Henry the Seventh. But both the sons of Katherine
Swynford were born before wedlock. Edmund of
Langley espoused Isabel, second daughter of Peter the Cruel,
and had two sons       Edward, Duke of York, who fell at
Agincourt, and Richard, Earl of Cambridge, who married
Anne Mortimer, daughter of the Earl of March, and left a
son, Richard, Duke of York."       See Sandford's Genealogical
History.



[3] A serious quarrel       destined to be fought out eight
years later on Hexham Field       occurred about this date between
the chief of the Beauforts and Warwick's younger
brother, who, in 1461, became Lord Montagu. "It was not
long after that dissension and unkindness fell between the
young Duke of Somerset and Sir John Neville, son unto the
Earl of Salisbury, being then both lodged within the city.
Whereof the mayor being warned, ordained such watch and
provision that if they had any thing stirred he was able to
have subdued both parties, and to have put them in ward till
he had known the king's pleasure. Whereof the friends of
both parties being aware, labored such means that they
agreed them for that time."       Fabyan's Chronicle.



[4] "But the earl's two sons       the one called Sir John Neville,
and the other Sir Thomas       were sore wounded; which,
slowly journeying into the north country, thinking there to
repose themselves, were in their journey apprehended by the
queen's friends, and conveyed to Chester. But their keepers
delivered them shortly, or else the Marchmen had destroyed
the jails. Such favor had the commons of Wales to
the Duke of York's band and his affinity, that they could suffer
no wrong to be done, nor evil word to be spoken of him
or of his friends."       Hall's Union of the Families of Lancaster
and York.



[5] "At that period, the men-at-arms, or heavy cavalry,
went to battle in complete armor; each man carried a lance,
sword, dagger, and occasionally a mace or battle-axe; his
horse, also, was, to a certain extent, in armor. A considerable
part of an English army consisted of archers, armed
with long bows and arrows; and another part consisted of
men armed with bills, pikes, pole-axes, glaives, and morris-pikes."       Brooke's
Visits to Fields of Battle.



[6] "One of the greatest obstacles to the cause of the Red
Rose, was the popular belief that the young prince was not
Henry's son. Had that belief not been widely spread and
firmly maintained, the lords who arbitrated between Henry
VI. and Richard, Duke of York, in October, 1460, could
scarcely have come to the resolution to set aside the Prince
of Wales altogether, to accord Henry the crown for his life,
and declare the Duke of York his heir."       Sir E. B. Lytton's
Last of the Barons.



[7] "The chase," says Hall, "continued all night, and the
most part of the next day; and ever the northern men, when
they saw or perceived any advantage, returned again and
fought with their enemies, to the great loss of both parties."



[8] "George Neville, brother to the great Earl of Warwick,
at his installment into his archbishopric of York, made
a prodigious feast to the nobility, chief clergy, and many
gentry, wherein he spent 300 quarters of wheat, 330 tuns of
ale, 104 tuns of wine, 1 pipe of spiced wine, 80 fat oxen, 6
wild bulls, 1004 sheep, 3000 hogs, 300 calves, 3000 geese,
3000 capons, 300 pigs, 100 peacocks, 200 cranes, 200 kids,
2000 chickens, 4000 pigeons, 4000 rabbits, 204 bittours, 4000
ducks, 400 herons, 200 pheasants, 500 partridges, 4000 woodcocks,
400 plovers, 100 curlews, 100 quails, 100 egrets, 200
rees, above 400 bucks, does, and roebucks, 5506 venison
pasties, 5000 dishes of jelly, 6000 custards, 300 pikes, 300
breams, 8 seals, 4 porpoises, and 400 tarts. At this feast
the Earl of Warwick was steward, the Lord Hastings comptroller,
with many other noble officers, 1000 servitors, 62
cooks, 515 scullions."       Burton's Admirable Curiosities in England.



[9] "Herbert was not a little joyous of the king's letter,
partly to deserve the king's liberality, which, of a mean gentleman,
had promoted him to the estate of an earl, partly for
the malice that he bare to the Earl of Warwick, being the
sole obstacle (as he thought) why he obtained not the wardship
of the Lord Bonville's daughter and heir for his eldest
son."       Grafton's Chronicle.



[10] "The absence of the Earl of Warwick," says Hall,
"made the common people daily more and more to long,
and be desirous to have the sight of him, and presently to
behold his personage. For they judged that the sun was
clearly taken from the world when he was absent. In such
high estimation, among the people, was his name, that
neither no one man they had in so much honor, neither no
one person they so much praised, or, to the clouds, so highly
extolled. What shall I say? His only name sounded in
every song, in the mouth of the common people, and his
person was represented with great reverence when public
plays or open triumphs should be showed or set forth abroad
in the streets."



[11] "It is vain," says Sir E. Bulwer Lytton, "that some
writers would seek to cleanse the memory of the learned nobleman
from the stain of cruelty, by rhetorical remarks on
the improbability that a cultivator of letters should be of a
ruthless disposition. The general philosophy of this defense
is erroneous. In ignorant ages, a man of superior acquirements
is not necessarily made humane by the cultivation of
his intellect; on the contrary, he too often learns to look
upon the uneducated herd as things of another clay. Of
this truth all history is pregnant."



[12] "On the 14th of February," says Fabyan, "the Duke
of Exeter came to London, and on the 27th rode the Earl
of Warwick through the city toward Dover for to have received
Queen Margaret. But he was disappointed, for the
wind was to her so contrary that she lay at the sea-side,
tarrying for a convenient wind, from November till April.
And so the said earl, when he had long tarried for her at
the sea-side, was fain to return without speed of his purpose."



[13] "Of the death of this prince," says Fabyan, "divers
tales were told; but the most common fame went, that he
was sticked with a dagger by the hands of the Duke of
Gloucester."



[14] "Sir John Arundel had long before been told, by some
fortune-teller, he should be slain on the sands; wherefore,
to avoid that destiny, he removed from Efford, near Stratton-on-the-Sands,
where he dwelt, to Trerice, far off from
the sea, yet by this misfortune fulfilled the prediction in another
place."       Polwhele's History of Cornwall.



[15] "The most honorable part of Louis's treaty with Edward
was the stipulation for the liberty of Queen Margaret....
Louis paid fifty thousand crowns for her ransom."       Hume's
History.



[16]
"Jocky of Norfolk, be not too bold,
For Dickon, thy master, is bought and sold."




[17] When Margaret Plantagenet was married to Charles
the Rash, Caxton accompanied that royal lady to her new
home, and, while in her service in Flanders, learned the art
of printing. Having returned to England, and been presented
by Anthony Woodville to Edward of York, he, under
the king's protection, set up his printing-press in the
Almonry at Westminster.



[18] After a long and cruel captivity, Warwick was, in 1499,
executed on Tower Hill, "for no other offense," says Dugdale,
"than being the only male Plantagenet at that time
living, and consequently the most rightful heir to the throne."
Fuller, in his Worthies of England, says that "Henry, being
of a new lineage and surname, knew full well how the nation
hankered after the name of Plantagenet; which, as it did
outsyllable Tudor in the mouths, so did it outvie it in the
hearts of the English."

ABBOTTS' ILLUSTRATED HISTORIES.

Biographical Histories. By Jacob Abbott and John S.
C. Abbott. The Volumes of this Series are printed and
bound uniformly, and are embellished with numerous Engravings.
16mo, Cloth, $1 00 per volume. Price of the set (32
vols.), $32 00.

A series of volumes containing severally full accounts of the lives,
characters, and exploits of the most distinguished sovereigns, potentates,
and rulers that have been chiefly renowned among mankind,
in the various ages of the world, from the earliest periods to
the present day.

The successive volumes of the series, though they each contain
the life of a single individual, and constitute thus a distinct and independent
work, follow each other in the main, in regular historical
order, and each one continues the general narrative of history down
to the period at which the next volume takes up the story; so that
the whole series presents to the reader a connected narrative of the
line of general history from the present age back to the remotest
times.

The narratives are intended to be succinct and comprehensive, and
are written in a very plain and simple style. They are, however, not
juvenile in their character, nor intended exclusively for the young.
The volumes are sufficiently large to allow each history to comprise
all the leading facts in the life of the personage who is the subject
of it, and thus to communicate all the information in respect to him
which is necessary for the purposes of the general reader.

Such being the design and character of the works, they would
seem to be specially adapted, not only for family reading, but also
for district, town, school, and Sunday-school libraries, as well as for
text-books in literary seminaries.

The plan of the series, and the manner in which the design has
been carried out by the author in the execution of it, have been highly
commended by the press in all parts of the country. The whole
series has been introduced into the school libraries of several of the
largest and most influential states.

Abraham Lincoln's Opinion of Abbotts' Histories.       In a conversation
with the President just before his death, Mr. Lincoln said: "I
want to thank you and your brother for Abbotts' series of Histories. I
have not education enough to appreciate the profound works of voluminous
historians; and if I had, I have no time to read them. But
your series of Histories gives me, in brief compass, just that knowledge
of past men and events which I need. I have read them with the greatest
interest. To them I am indebted for about all the historical knowledge
I have."

Few men enjoy a wider or better earned popularity as a writer
for the young than Jacob Abbott. His series of histories, and stories
illustrative of moral truths, have furnished amusement and instruction
to thousands. He has the knack of piquing and gratifying
curiosity. In the book before us he shows his happy faculty of imparting
useful information through the medium of a pleasant narrative,
keeping alive the interest of the young reader, and fixing in
his memory valuable truths.       Mercury, New Bedford, Mass.

Jacob Abbott is almost the only writer in the English language
who knows how to combine real amusement with real instruction
in such a manner that the eager young readers are quite as much
interested in the useful knowledge he imparts as in the story which
he makes so pleasant a medium of instruction.       Buffalo Commercial
Advertiser.

* * * Mr. Abbott has avoided the errors so common with writers
for popular effect, that of slurring over the difficulties of the subject
through the desire of making it intelligible and attractive to unlearned
readers. He never tampers with the truth of science, nor
attempts to dodge the solution of a knotty problem behind a cloud
of plausible illustrations.       N. Y. Tribune.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
