PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI

Volume 93



December 3, 1887.



edited by Sir Francis Burnand


THE LETTER-BAG OF TOBY, M.P.

From the Lord Mayor of Dublin.

Mansion House, Dublin, Saturday.





Dear Toby,

The news from Ireland, not all of which finds its way into your daily
papers, grows in excitement. The exploit of Mr.  span
class="smcap">Douglas P-ne, M.P., of Lisfinny Castle, has taken
root, and all the landed gentry among the Irish Members are fortifying
themselves in their castles, and hanging themselves outside the
front-door by ropes to deliver addresses to their constituents. The
regular thing now is to hang out our M.P.'s on the outer wall. I do not
see accounts of these proceedings in your London papers. I was, as you
know, a Journalist before I was Lord Mayor; so, if you don't mind, I'll
send you a few jottings. If there is anything due for lineage, please
remit it anonymously to the Land League Fund "From A Sympathiser."

Foremost in this band of heroic patriots is the ch       telain of
Butlerstown, Joseph G-ll-s B-gg-r, M.P.,
Butlerstown Castle, as everyone acquainted with Ireland knows, stands on
the summit of a Danish rath, and was once the seat of an  span
class="smcap">O'Toole. Now it is the den of  span
class="smcap">Joseph G-ll-s. For some time he has been practising
a flying leap from the eastern to the western turret, a distance of
fifty feet over a yawning abyss, amid the cavernous depths of which the
petulant plummet has played in vain. It is thrilling, whether at early
dawn, or what time the darkening wing of Night begins to flap, to hear a
shrill cry of "Hear, hear!" to see a well-known figure cleaving the
astonished air, and to behold Joseph G-ll-s,
erewhile upright on the eastern turret, prone on that which lifts its
head nearer the setting sun. To be present on one of the occasions when
Joey B. reads a Blue Book for three hours to
a deputation shivering in the moat, is enough to convince the dullest
Saxon of the hopelessness of enthralling a nation which has given birth
to such as he. As Joseph himself says,
quoting, with slight variation, my own immortal verse,       


"Whether on the turret high,
Or in the moat not dry,
What matter if for Ireland dear we talk!"


But the affairs at Butlerstown should not withdraw our gaze from a not
less momentous event which recently happened in the neighbourhood of
Cork city. Mr. P-rn-ll, as he has recently
explained to you, has not found it expedient or even necessary to take
part in our recent public proceedings in Ireland. But this abstention is
to a certain extent illusory. It is no secret in our inner circles that
our glorious Chief was but the other day in close communication with his
constituents in the city of Cork. He arrived shortly after breakfast in
a balloon which was skilfully brought to pause over the rising ground by
Sunday's Well. At the approach of the balloon the trained intelligence
of the Police fathomed the plot. The Privy Council was immediately
communicated with. Sworn information was laid, and the meeting was
solemnly proclaimed by telegraph. In the meanwhile, Mr.  span
class="smcap">P-rn-ll had addressed the meeting at some length
and met with an enthusiastic reception. The Police massing in
considerable numbers and beginning to b       ton the electors, the Hon.
Member poured a bag of ballast over them, and the balloon, gracefully
rising, disappeared in the direction of Limerick. The proceedings then
terminated.

I expect that the success of this new departure, or perhaps I should say
this unexpected arrival, will encourage our great Chief to pay a series
of flying visits to Ireland. His adventure was certainly happier and
more successful than one which befell our esteemed friend  span
class="smcap">Tim H-ly, and nearly brought to an untimely
conclusion a life dear to us and of inestimable value to Ireland.  span
class="smcap">Tim was announced to take the chair at a mass
meeting summoned under the auspices of the local branch of the Land
League of Longford. A room was taken, the word passed round, and all
preparations made for a successful meeting. The Police, however, got
wind of it, and of course the meeting was proclaimed. But  span
class="smcap">Tim, as you may happen to know, is not the man to
have his purpose lightly set aside. It was made known that  span
class="smcap">Tim would make his speech and the Police might
catch him if they could. You know, may be, the big factory in the
thriving town of Longford       the one with a tall chimbly? Well, the word
was passed along again that the bhoys were to assemble about the
factory. "Would they bring a chair or a table," they said, "for  span
class="smcap">Tim to stand on?" "No," said  span
class="smcap">Tim, wiping his spectacles, "you leave it to me."

Meeting announced to take place at eight o'clock. On the very strike of
the hour, a stentorian voice, not unfamiliar in the House of Commons,
floated over the assembled multitude. "Men of Longford," it said, "we
are assembled here in the exercise of our privilege as free men." First
of all they could not tell where the voice came from. Looking up,
behold! there was Tim planted inside the top
of the tall chimbley, using it like a Bishop's pulpit. It was a capital
idea, and worked admirably for half an hour, with the Police all
throbbing and raging round, and Tim eyeing
them quite calmly, and all the crowd roaring and cheering, and throwing
up their hats, and B-lf-r getting it hot.
Somehow, whether from treachery or accident no one knows, and perhaps
never will know, but in the middle of one of his best sentences,  span
class="smcap">Tim suddenly vanished from sight, and was a clear
three minutes later picked up from among the cinders in the furnace
below. The proceedings then terminated.

There is a good deal more I could tell you,  span
class="smcap">Toby, my bhoy, if time permitted. I should like
above all to tell you of Major O'G-rm-n's
magnificent oration delivered from the main shaft of the sewer in
Waterford, with his former constituents hanging on his lips and the
grate of the sewer. But I am just off myself to address a meeting of my
fellow citizens. This too, is of course, proclaimed, and equally of
course that makes no difference. I get on the top of the Lord Mayor's
coach, leaning on the Mace, and supported by the Sword-bearer. The
horses move at walking pace, and I address the crowd. It's wonderful
what a lot one can take out of B-lf-r that
way.

Yours faithfully, T. D. S-ll-v-n.
      



AMEN!

"So mote it be!" That deep and reverent prayer
In all true hearts finds echo everywhere;
Not least in those that flush with British blood.
Prince, a loved daughter from our Royal brood,
In trouble as in joy, is at your side,
Sharing your sorrow as she shared your pride.
For her dear sake, and for your own not less,
We wish you, gallant soldier-chief, success
In a dread struggle keener, sterner far
Than those you faced in the fierce lists of war.
We know       have you not proved it?       that 'twill be
Met with the same cool steadfast gallantry
As marked your bearing in more martial strife.
Punch joins in that warm prayer for "the dear life,"
And echoes, from a far yet kindred strand,
The pleading voices of the Fatherland!

MR. PUNCH'S PARALLELS.  No. 4.




SIR W. V. HARCOURT AS FALSTAFF.

"There's no more valour in that Goschen than
in a Wild Duck.".... "A plague of all Cowards still say I!"
Henry the Fourth, Part I., Act ii, Scenes 2 and 4.


Mrs. Ram, at this time of year, takes a great
interest in the state of the weather, and studies the daily
Meteorological chronicle. She says that she always reads the reports
from Ben Nevis's Observatory. She hopes that, one of these fine days,
this learned astronomer will be made a Knight. Sir  span
class="smcap">Benjamin Nevis would be, she considers, a very nice
title. "Of course," she adds, "judging by his name, he must be a Jew.
They're such clever people. And, let me see, ain't there a proverb, or
something of that sort, about 'the Jew of Ben Nevis'?"



BISHOP AND PORT.

My Dear Mr. Punch,

In my Autobiography, which I am glad and proud to say, has met with your
cordial approbation, I have recorded how the late lamented Bishop, Dr.
Sumner, said to me, "I have drunk a bottle of
port wine every day since I was a boy." Well, his son, the Archdeacon,
is annoyed at this statement. Now, my memory is a very good one, and if
I am wrong in one point so circumstantially narrated, why not in
several, why not in all? If the Bishop did not say this, to me, who
did? Somebody said it, that I will swear. Who said it? If my memory
fails me, is it not also likely that the Bishop's memory was not
particularly good, and consequently, that he was mistaken in thinking
that he had drunk a bottle a day since his boyhood? I have little doubt
that the Bishop only imagined it, and perhaps he was joking. Perhaps he
was playing on the words "bishop" and "port." "Bishop" was a hot drink,
I fancy, made with port wine. I have no hesitation in comforting his
Archidiaconal offspring by assuring him that, to the best of my
knowledge and belief, his father, the Bishop, did not drink a bottle of
port every day since his boyhood. He was a very fine old clergyman       I
forget whether he was exactly portly or not, or whether he resided in
Portman Square,       and I should say that first-rate port, such as the
elixir vit        that made a hale centenarian of Sir  span
class="smcap">Moses Montefiore, taken frequently, would have
tended to make him the genial prelate he was. Had he only gone into port
once, that would not have sufficed to have produced such a Bishop, for
"One swallow does not make a Sumner."

Yours ever,W(ithdraw) P(ort) Frith.

P.S.       The Archdeacon is satisfied, and if he will only come round to see
me and bring a bottle of the port the Bishop didn't drink, why, on my
word as an artist, I'll draw the cork.



"What shall he have who kills the Deer?" Why, something to eat,
of course. At least this was, among others, the notion of the poor
starving Cottars. And they have now given up venison-eating because the
food is deer.

ROBERT AT KILBURN.

I had the cureosity one day to arsk a lerned gennelman on whom I was
waiting, whether the poor fellers who lived in the world ever so many
hundred years ago had got any Copperashuns. He pretended not to
understand me at fust, and said, with a larf, as he dared say as they
was made much as we was; that is to say, sum with large ones, and some
with little ones; but when I xplained what I reely meant, he told me as
they had, speshally amung the Romuns as lived in Ittaly. He was a werry
amusing Gent, and when I arsked him what langwidge the Romuns torked, he
tried to gammon me as they all spoke Latin, ewen the little children and
all, but in coarse I wasn't quite such a hignoramus as to swaller that,
as my son William, who isn't by no means a
fool, learnt Latin at Skool for three year and tells me as he carn't
speak it a bit. The lerned gent also told me as it was such a rum tung
to speak that they hadn't not no word for "Yes!" So that if a Gent of
those long days had bin a dining at the "Ship and Turtle" an bin a
waited on by an Hed Waiter, like me, and had said to him "Woud you like
arf-a-crown, Waiter?" the pore feller woodn't have been able to say,
"Yessir!" I was jest a leetle shocked at his torking such rubbish to me,
it was hardly respekful, speshally as he had ony drunk one pint of
Bollinger and one of our 63 Port, but its astonishing how heasily sum
peeple's heds is affected. I was in hopes as he woud have tried the
experymint on me, but he didn't, but went smiling away.

I shood werry much have liked to have heard a good deal more about them
werry old Copperashuns, and weather they was to be compared to that
werry old 'un as I nose so well and respecs so ighly, for good deeds as
well as good living. Take their werry last one as a sample. Earing of
what was a going on down at Kilburn on Guy Fox day, and finding as the
return train would bring me back in time for my perfeshnal dooties, I
went there and found thowsands of peeple all met in a nice little new
Park, that the old Lord Mare was a coming
down to fust of all crissen, and then throw open to the publick. And
down he came accordingly in his full state Carridge, and his full state
Footmen, and his full state Sherryiffs, and their full state Carridges
and Footmen, jest for all the world as if he was a going to make a call
on a few Royal Princes and Dooks, insted of opening a new Park
surrounded by numbers of the reel working-classes. But he always has bin
a reel gennelman, and never makes no difference atween rich and poor
when he can do some good. I wasn't quite near enuff to hear what he said
when he made his speech, but a werry respectable reporter arterwards
told me, that the Lord Mare had written a
letter to Queen Wictoria to ask if he might
call the Park after her. And she had wrote to him in reply, "Deer  span
class="smcap">Handsum, as there's alreddy a Wictoria Park, you
may call this here one the Qween's Park. Pleas to remember this 5th of
Nowember, Yours trewly, W. R. I."

When the Lord Mare enounced this pleasing
intelligence, thus simply exprest, lorks how we did all cheer, and a
little band that had bin hid in a little tent, struck up the hole of arf
a werse of God Save the Queen, at which we all took off our hats,
footmen and all, and braved the bitter blarst with our bare heds. Ah,
that's wot I calls trew loyalty, and long may it continue, not the cold
bitter blarst, but the warm sweet loyalty, for I'm sorry to say as the
unusual xposure guv me a bad cold.

I got back just in time for the Bankwet. The Lord
Mare with his usual kindness had let the Chairman of the
Committee, the sillibrated Mr. Woodbacon, the
grate bookseller, take the Chair, and a remarkabul good un he made,
setting so good a xample as regards short speeches as made ewerybody
follow suit.

And now what was this hole proceeding all about? This is what I learnt
from what was said:       

It wood seem then, that at Kilburn where it was wunce all green feelds,
there has growed up a reglar crowd of working peeple with far more than
their fair share of children and as the feelds has all come for to be
bilt over, the poor little children afoursaid have been obleeged to do
their playing in the streets, and the nateral or rather unnateral
consequence has follered, as that numbers of the poor little deers was
run over and killed. So a nice little Park has been made for 'em all to
play in, where they can injoy their fresh hair and releeve their poor
Mother's minds, and grow up red and strong and harty, instead of white
and weak and wan. And the old Copperashun having put it all ship shape,
and promist to keep it all in order for hever, arsked the  span
class="smcap">Lord Mare to go down and open it, as he did, and in
sitch full state that one of the natives said as it was like a lot of
sunbeams suddenly cumming out on a clowdy day. So the  span
class="smcap">Lord Mare finished his long list of good deeds by
adding one more to 'em, and the Copperashun added one more Open Space to
the many they has either secured or helped to secure. So wenever I hears
a sneer at 'em I shall say, "Please to remember that 5th of November!"

Robert.

"PRAVE 'ORTS."

"By the bye, dear Professor, which would you
say       Abiog        n-esis, or Abiogen      s-is?"

"Neither, my dear Madam, if I could possibly
help it!"


An Important Summing-up. (By Our Own
Special Reporter in the recent case of Somebody or Other v. Another
Person of the name of Barley).       Mr.
Justice Mathew regretted being compelled to
decide against Barley on the question of
"quantities." Of course, there had been an error on the part of the
highly respectable Corporation of Ramsgate, which might be characterised
as a "sin of commission," while the neglect of their clerk to enter
their arrangement with Barley on the minutes
was a "sin of omission." All the witnesses in this case must be
believed, as they had,          propos of  span
class="smcap">Barley, taken their oats       he should say their
oaths. Perhaps when the present statute came to be revised, Mr.  span
class="smcap">Barley might act for the town, for which it appears
he had done good service, and Barley would
not have to hide under a bushel. It was clear that this sort of  span
class="smcap">Barley was worth more than the present price of
28s. a quarter. Counsel on both sides had made an eloquent
display of wheat       he begged pardon, he meant "wit"       and if in this
judgment he had to tread on anyone's corn, he assured them that to do so
went against the grain. As an official,  span
class="smcap">Barley would have the sack, but sack and all could
be taken up to another Court, and there, as a German speaking French
would say, On beut Barley, about it still further. (The Jury
thanked his Lordship, and all the parties left the Court much pleased,
humming All about the Barley.



"They acted a Greek Play at Cambridge, my dear," said Mrs.  span
class="smcap">Ram to a friend, "and fancy, it was written, as I
am informed, by a young lady, Miss Sophie
Klees. I suppose she is a student of Girton. How clever! I
couldn't write it, I'm sure."



The "Quart d'heure de Rabelais," if translated into Anglo-French,
may be taken to express a bad time of it with the roughs in Trafalgar
Square, i.e., a mauvais quart d'heure de Rabble       eh?



The Works of Charles Dickens must have
achieved great popularity in South Eastern Europe, where there is an

THE NEW SCHOOL.

Schoolboy (aged 16). "Good-bye, old Chappies! Can't waste any
more time with you. 'Good business'!"



TOM BROWN       CO.'S SCHOOL DAYS.

A Glimpse at the Commercial Education of the Future.

Twelve o'Clock struck, and the Fourth Form at St. Dunstan's
left its class-room with a rush. The old hour of leaving off the
morning's studies was still preserved. Yet, in conformity with the
spirit of the times, the venerable foundation of St. Dunstan's had
recently witnessed great changes. The Governing Body had taken
the matter in hand, and had gone to work with a will. The teaching
of Greek and Latin had been entirely suppressed, polite literature
eliminated, and the whole curriculum of the school arranged
solely to the provision of that glaring want of the times, a sound
commercial education. To effect this, some radical changes had
been necessary. The Rev. Jabez Plumkin, D.D.,
Oxford Prizeman,
through whose unwearied exertions, for the past five-and-twenty
years, St. Dunstan's had been gradually acquiring an increasing
fame in the Class-lists of both Universities, had been forcibly ejected
from the Head-Mastership, and his place filled by a leading member
of a well-known firm of advertising stock-jobbers, and the
Assistant-Masters
had all been selected on similar lines.

"Company-floating," was taught by a late Promoter, who had had
much experience in the creation of many bubble concerns, and
"Rigging the Market" was entrusted to a Professor who was known,
in his capacity as Accountant to a wholesale City Cheese Warehouse,
to have contracted a thorough familiarity with this important subject
of the new commercial education. Everything was done to foster
a spirit of keen speculative enterprise in the boys. The whole
traditions of the school were changed. The old idea of honour had
died out. How to over-reach each other by sharp practice was the
one idea that animated every youthful breast from the senior in the
Sixth to the junior in the Under Third. The tape was always working
at the Principal's desk. The study-tables were covered with
Stock and Mining Journals. Even the playground was turned into
a Money Market. Cricket had been banished to make way for the
more exciting game of "Bulls and Bears," and the Principal passing
through occasionally, would sometimes stop and say, "That's right,
my boys, learn to do each other, and remember the motto of your
School, 'Monies maketh man.'" Posted up upon the gates, communicated
by telegraph hourly from the City, were every day to be
found the latest prices. And it was to get a first look at this that
the Fourth Form had just left its class-room with a rush.

A crowd of eager faces were anxiously scanning the latest quotations,
and notes were being taken in a score of pocket-books, whipped
out for the purpose. Tom Brown       Co.       he had
earned this sobriquet
from his companions for his shrewd business capacity       did not,
however, join the throng, but stood a little way off, looking on, and
waiting for the excitement to abate. Gradually it calmed down, and
the boys broke up into little knots and groups, discussing the state
of the market. Then he spoke:       

"Look here, you fellows," he said, "I've got a good thing on here,
that, I fancy, will be more worth your attention than even the latest
prices." He pulled a prospectus from his pocket. An interested
crowd closed round him at once. "It's 'Old Mother  span
class="smcap">Noggins,
Limited,'" he went on, reading from the paper before him, "This
Company has been started for the purpose of acquiring at wholesale
prices all the tarts, bull's-eyes, apples, toffy, and ginger-beer,
forming the present stock-in-trade of Old Mother  span
class="smcap">Noggins's store,
and for retailing the same at a figure, that will, after paying the
guaranteed interest on the fourpenny debenture shares, admit of the
declaration of a dividend of 14 per cent. on the ordinary paid-up
share capital of the Company.

A buzz of excited admiration went up from the throng. The Fourth
Form at St. Dunstan's had not for a long time had such a good thing
put before it.

"I know," continued Tom, producing a bundle
of forms of application
from his pocket, "that you fellows, would like to hear of it.
Who'll go for it?"

There was a loud responsive shout of "I!" and a dozen hands were
at once stretched towards the speaker. Business commenced, and
sixpences, shillings, and half-crowns were pouring into  span
class="smcap">Tom's pockets
faster than he could cram them there. He was making a very good
morning's work of it. Presently, a dull, heavy-looking boy joined
the group.

"Hullo, Flopper!" cried  span
class="smcap">Tom, addressing this last arrival, "why
don't you put that ten bob your Uncle sent you into this thing? I'll
be bound he told you to turn it over. You won't get such a chance
every day."

"What is it?" asked Flopper.

A chorus of voices instantly joined in a brief explanation of the
advantages of investing in "Old Mother  span
class="smcap">Noggins' Limited."

"By Jove!" said Flopper, "I don't know that I
won't."

"Not if I know it," cried an authoritative voice, breaking in upon
the scene. It was Snagsby, the "Sharper" who
spoke. There was a
general look in his direction, and a disposition to make way for
him as he approached. He had been mixed up disadvantageously
in a recent "corner" in marbles, and had from time to time floated
several concerns that had never paid any dividends, and was generally
regarded as a "queer" customer in consequence. It was for
this reason that he had been nicknamed the "Sharper."

"And what do you want him to do with his money?" asked  span
class="smcap">Tom, stepping forward in a defiant attitude.

"He'll put every blessed halfpenny of it into my 'General Pen-knife
Supply,'" was the laconic reply. "He signed for the allotment
last night."

"But I've changed my mind," pleaded Flopper,
helplessly, and
he handed the half-sovereign to Tom.

"You give that up!" cried the Sharper, menacingly.

"You try to take it!" replied Tom, grimly.

In another instant the Sharper had flown at  span
class="smcap">Tom. There was a
brief struggle. Tom hit out at him, and
caught him in the face.

"Oh, that's your game, is it!" shouted the Sharper. "You'll
fight me for that."

"Fight you? When and where you like," replied  span
class="smcap">Tom.

There was a general cheering and throwing up of hats.

"Hooray! There's going to be a fight between the Sharper and
Tom Brown       Co.," shouted the Fourth Form.
They hadn't had
such good news for a long time.



The whole School was there, and the third round had been fought.
Betting had been fast and furious, and there had been several
attempts made by the supporters of both champions to break the
ring and put an end to the contest when the fortunes of the day
seemed to be going against their own special favourite. But now a
curious thing happened. After a little preliminary sparring in the
fourth round, Tom Brown       Co., suddenly dropping
on one knee, went to the ground.

In a few seconds the surprising news was known that he had given
in. The sponge was thrown up, and the Sharper declared the victor.
Tom was quickly surrounded by his friends,
and led off the field.
Flopper ran up to him. "I'm so sorry,  span
class="smcap">Tom," he said, "that you
should have fought in my quarrel, and have got licked."

There was a twinkle in Tom's eye. "My dear
fellow," he replied.
"Don't imagine I wouldn't have thrashed him; but business
is business, and I got a good price for not doing so. Didn't you
twig that I sold the fight?"



That night Tom Brown       Co. wrote home an
enthusiastic account
of his day's doings to his parents. The next morning,  span
class="smcap">Tom Brown,
Senior, referring to the letter with a glow of pride on his commercial
face, remarked to his better-half that the boy's training seemed
perfect,
and that he was destined to turn out remarkably well. "I can't
tell you," he added, "how I long to see that boy loose upon the
Stock Exchange. He will be a credit to the family."

SHOWS VIEWS.

By Victor Who-goes-Everywhere.







What can be more dismal than the fourth day of a Fancy Bazaar for a
"Sale of Work," in aid of a parochial charity? Honestly, I do not know.
I fancy that even the proverbial "Mute at a funeral," must be livelier.
That is my present opinion, and it was the same last Thursday, when
lured by a programme quaintly printed in "old-faced" type, and having
"ye" in lieu of "the," and "Maister" instead of Mister, I made my way to
the Portman Rooms in Baker Street, (formerly Madame  span
class="smcap">Tussaud's) and sought admission to "Old Marybone
Gardens, A.D. 1670." Outside the ex
dep       t of Waxworks, were two persons in the costume of the last
Century distributing circulars, and later on I met another couple
similarly apparelled heading a procession of Sandwich-men walking down
Waterloo Place. In the Hall of the Bazaar lads in the same sort of
dresses, were selling programmes (marked sixpence) for twopence. I
entered by a small canvass-cottage "y'clept" (as the Sale of Workers
would call it) "the Rose of Normandy," and found myself in the once
famous "Hall of Kings" without the figures. I discovered two or three
dwarf trees, some lattice-work and a lot of canvass-covering. I must
confess it did not cause me much surprise to find only a few spectators.
The moment I appeared, a lady advanced and asked me in a tone of
authority to take a button-hole. I refused with courtesy suggestive at
once of the gallant and the miser, and the Sale of Work-woman retired
rather crest-fallen. Then two girls, costumed as two females of a past
but vague period, dashed at me as I turned away, and breathlessly
explained that if I bought a half-crown ticket I should be entitled to a
chance in a raffle for a five-guinea sofa-cushion. I slightly frowned as
I expeditiously refused the invitation, and the ladies disappeared into
a corner       I trust more in sorrow than in anger       to read the evening
paper. In the centre of the room was a "fish pond" full of presents,
where a mild-looking curate was feebly attempting to secure a prize. On
the whole the entertainment was scarcely exhilarating. The programme
promised "from V to VI of ye clocke" (how silly!) "a s        ance of
Mesmerism," in two "partes," (how really stupid!) and "Maister  span
class="smcap">Charles Bertram" (Why "Maister?") was to appear
later on. Then at eight "of ye clocke" (dear, dear! how idiotic!)
"the Welbeck Dramatic Club" (what a name!) was "to performe ye Comic
Drama by L. S. Buckingham, y'clept" (of
course!) "Take that Girl away." Later still "Mistresse  span
class="smcap">Jarley" was to give her waxworks with the
assistance of "Maister Sidney Ward," (tut,
tut!) the Festival finally closing with "Music" at "X of ye clocke"
(stuff and nonsense!). It will be seen that I cannot even now look at
the programme (priced at sixpence and sold for twopence) without some
signs of impatience. The afternoon was too young to allow of my
assisting at any of these toothsome merry-makings, so after mooning
about for a quarter of an hour I came away. As I left, a newly-arrived
dame of mature years was putting on a nurse's cap hurriedly, evidently
with the view to starting in hot pursuit of me to secure my custom for
some toys. The ladies with the cushion looked at me languidly as I
passed them, and then returned to a perusal of their paper. When last I
had had the advantage of paying a visit to "the Portman Rooms, formerly
Mme. Tussaud's," I had seen nothing but
waxwork figures in eccentric attitudes. On the whole, I think the former
denizens of the place looked more at home in their quaint costumes than
the Sale of Workers "from Tuesday, November 22 to Saturday, November 26,
inclusive!"

Finding myself in its neighbourhood, I could not help taking a turn in
the present palace of the eminent "Portrait Modellist." I paid the
necessary shilling and the optional sixpence, and renewed my
acquaintance with "The Kings and Queens," "The Coronation Group," and
"The Chamber of Horrors." A group representing a reception at the
Vatican was quite new, if I except two or three funeral attendants, who,
I fancy I remember, made their last (but one) appearance at the Lying in
State of Pio Nono. After examining a rather
cheerful presentment of the latest assassin in "The Chamber of
Comparative Physiognomy" (as the Chamber of Horrors was once, for a
short period, "y'clept"), I passed through a turnstile, and entered the
Refreshment Department. Here I noticed that an "overflow meeting,"
consisting, amongst other more-or-less-interesting exhibits of Mr.  span
class="smcap">Lewis Wingfield's historical costume-wearers (from
the Healtheries), and that now rather-imperfectly-remembered worthy, the
late Sir Bartle Frere (from the rooms above),
had been humorously arranged, no doubt with a view to provoking healthy
and hearty laughter. Having refreshed my mind with a hurried inspection
of this delightful, albeit, somewhat miscellaneous gathering, and my
body with a twopenny Bath bun, I gracefully retired, greatly pleased
with the afternoon's entertainment.



OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.





Reviewing the Pages.


What a set these Emperors, Empresses, Kings, Queens, Princes and
Princesses, Dukes and Duchesses,      c.,      c., and all such great people
everywhere seem to have been, according to the Memoirs of Count
Horace de Viel Castel (published by Messrs.  span
class="smcap">Remington       Co.), who was a kind of small French
Pepys, a great snob, and a Parisian Sir
Benjamin Backbite. Yet there is in this  span
class="smcap">Horace something of the Horatian satirist, only
without the poetry.

"But Horace, Sir, was delicate, was nice,"

which is not exactly the characteristic of the writings of  span
class="smcap">M. de Viel Castel, who tells us


            "Of birth-nights, balls, and shows,
More than ten Hollinsheds, or  span
class="smcap">Halls, or Stowes.
When the Queen frowned, or smiled, he knows; and what
A subtle Minister may make of that:
Who sins with whom:"              


And such like tittle-tattle ad nauseam, not sparing his own
father and brother. Imagine the sort of man who, night after night,
could sit down and chuckle over the composition of this precious diary!
"With the exception of the President and the Princess" ( span
class="smcap">Mathilde, at whose house he was perpetually
dining), he says, "all the (Buonaparte)
family are good for nothing."

Of the bourgeois class he writes, "They are always the same
stupid, craven-hearted, vain race." He was shocked at the production of
La Dame aux Camelias, and considered it as a degradation of the
French stage and a disgrace to the Public that patronised the
performance. To have shocked M. de Viel
Castel was a feat indeed. Fould "the
foxy Jew" got ten millions out of the Cr        dit Foncier; so the public was
fool'd also. D'Orsay was "a ridiculous old
doll," and the Duke of Brunswick "an old
fool." He sneered at England, but considered at the moment that an
alliance with us was the best policy. The Empress at one time went in
for spirit-rapping, and consulted a table which told her a variety of
lies about the result and duration of the Crimean War. Such a table must
have been very black and supported by blacklegs, though it had
sufficient french polish about it to be silent in the presence of a
bishop. It is not until the last page of the Memoirs, 1864, that
the name of M. de Bismarck appears. I suppose
that "Society," high, low, or middle-class, has always gone on in much
the same way, more or less openly, according to the spirit of the Court,
since what is called "Society" came into existence; and invariably with
a Viel Castel, or a  span
class="smcap">Greville, or some one even less particular and more
observant "among them takin' notes" for future publication. Mr.
Bousfield, the translator, seems to have done his work with a judicious
regard for a certain section of English readers. It strikes me that he
has had the good taste to omit a few anecdotes about some of our own
exalted personages which would not have been received with unmixed
satisfaction in every quarter. This is only a surmise on my part, as I
am unacquainted with the original work.

Let me recommend everyone who values a powerful study of character more
than a merely cleverly-constructed story, to read Marzio's
Crucifix, by Marion Crawford. I do not
know what special opportunities the author had for the work, but the
characters are individually, masterpieces. The scene between
Marzio and Don Paolo, when the latter is wrapt in devout
contemplation of the artist's chef d'       uvre, is most striking,
and would have been more so had Marzio carried out his intention
of knocking his brother down, and disposing of him out of hand.

With Mr. Saunders's The Story of some
Famous Books (Elliot Stock) I was rather
disappointed, in consequence of there not being enough "famous books,"
and not much more story than the needy knife-grinder had to tell. Still,
I thank him for introducing me to a delightful name       " span
class="smcap">Theopompus of Chios"       whom, for this present, I
will take as my godfather, and sign myself,
Yours,     Theopompus, Baron de Book Worms.

"Puff, G-sch-n, puff! Like Boreas blow!

  We'll not give up the game.


"If we should let this fire die out

HOW TO ESCAPE THE FOG.

Fogs? Nonsense! Fogs are always mist. And the way to miss them is to go
to the Institute of Painters in Oil. That will oil the wheels of life in
this atrociously hibernal weather, and make existence in a fog
enjoyable. There, in the well-warmed, pleasantly-lighted rooms, will you
find countless pleasant pictures       delightful sea-subjects, charming
landscapes, and amusing scenes, by accomplished painters, which will
infuse a little Summer into the dull, depressing, brumous, filthy
atmosphere of a weary London Winter. If you cannot get away to Monte
Carlo, Mentone, Nice, or Rome, hasten at once and take one of Sir  span
class="smcap">John Linton's excursion coupons, and
personally conduct yourself       if you don't conduct yourself as you ought,
you'll probably be turned out       round the well-filled galleries in
Piccadilly.

A DOWN-Y PHILOSOPHER;

Or, Memoirs of a Missing Link.





Seal making a Deep Impression.


I've no particular reason to think an account of my life will interest
anybody. That being so, I don't know why I write it. But I do. I suppose
it's Chance. H-xl-y (who is such fun!)
calls my Memoir, because I'm a F.R.S., a case of "Fellow-De-Se."

Talking of Chance, everything that has ever happened to me has
been Chance!

For instance, what could have been more a matter of luck than my
choosing a house at Down? H-xl-y says
something about being "Down on my luck." (What a master of style old
H-xl-y is, to be sure!)

Then there was that voyage on the Sea-Mew. If it hadn't been that
my Uncle kicked me six times round his garden at Shrewsbury, because I
said "I'd be jiggered if I went," I don't believe I should ever have had
courage to accept the appointment of Naturalist to the expedition. That
voyage gave me an object in life. My nose had made me an object
in life before that (vide Portrait), but Natural Selection
triumphed over my nose, and so I became in due time famous, and an
Ag-nose-tic!

My Schooldays.

At school I was an exceptionally naughty boy. I cannot conceive what
induced me to tell another little boy that I had often produced
crab-apples by taking a dead crab and burying it in an orchard, but I
did. My little friend, I recollect, didn't believe me, and indeed pulled
my nose (always a sore point with me, but he made its point much sorer)
for telling what he called "beastly crams." We had a fight, I also
remember. Perhaps I ought to call it a "struggle for existence." He was
much the "fittest," and he survived. I got licked.

Choice of Calling.

My extreme naughtiness continued unabated when I became a young man.
Nobody expected I should ever "do" anything       except six months' hard
labour! At Cambridge I was so shockingly "rowdy," that my father
declared, there was no alternative but to send me into the Church. But
as I was hunting with the College drag at the hour when I ought to have
been in for my Ordination Examination, the Bishop failed to see matters
in the same light. I then decided to be a Doctor. If I had stuck to this
profession I fancy that my turn for trying experiments would have landed
me in some exalted position       possibly at Newgate. As it was, after
attending a lecture on Surgery, I was discovered in the local Hospital
trying to cut off a patient's leg on an entirely new principle, with a
pair of scissors and an old meat-saw, and I was nearly "run in" for
manslaughter. I decided to give up Medicine, and a slight shindy over a
supposed error of mine in calculating a score having prevented my
becoming a success as a Public-house Billiard-marker, I thought I would
make my mark in another way, as a breeder of race-horses. Being,
however, forcibly chucked out of Newmarket Heath one day for an alleged
irregularity which I never could understand, I began really to wonder
what profession I was fitted to adorn.

I become a Naturalist.

It was at this time that the Captain of the Sea-Mew offered me
that post of which I have before spoken. I accepted it, and began at
once to lower the record in sea-sickness, being never once well on board
ship for three whole years! It was a new experience, and altered
me a good deal. From being rowdy and idle I became quiet and abnormally
diligent. If you don't believe this, ask  span
class="smcap">H-xl-y (who is such fun!). On returning to England
I at once settled Down, and began to write books.

The "Origin of Species."

This work is my title to fame. It only took me thirty-three years and
six months to write. I felt quite glad when it was finished. People who
have read it tell me they feel the same, The row it caused was
frightful! If you want to see "Soapy Sam's"
slashing Quarterly Review article pulverised, read  span
class="smcap">H-xl-y's reply. (But, query       isn't this scientific
log-rolling?) The remark which was made, after perusing the book, by
that eminent Botanist, my friend Professor  span
class="smcap">Hookey, was       "Walker!" But he was soon converted.

My Way of Working.

This, also, can't interest anybody, yet I give it. I get up at 4  span
class="smcap">A.M., and take a walk. From 7 to 10 I work. After
dinner       with champagne       I take another stroll. I have made most
astonishing scientific discoveries at this time. I could, point out the
exact spot in the road where I became convinced that the whole
country had been elevated sixteen feet since the morning!  span
class="smcap">H-xl-y, who was with me, quite agreed, and said
that we must all have been elevated at the same time, without knowing
it.

My Favourite Authors.

These are, of course, Lyell on Lias,
and Hookey on Herbaceous Foraminifera.
They are far superior to Shakspeare, who
bores me. I like novels, the trashier the better. Only let 'em end well,
and I don't care how they begin, or whether they begin at all. In
newspapers, the best part, I think, is the Parliamentary Debates. In
reading them I have often got valuable hints as to the "Origin of
Speeches," and they frequently afford conclusive evidence of the
"Descent of Man." I thought of bringing Parliamentary manners in as a
chapter in my book on "Earth-worms," but  span
class="smcap">H-xl-y advised me not to, and I didn't.

My Nose.

I think I've mentioned this feature before. It troubles me. It is
undoubtedly of a low type, yet it has survived! Why have I not been
fitted with a fitter one? It is another instance of the fact that
everything       including my fame       has come to me by sheer luck.  span
class="smcap">H-xl-y says "there's a Dar-winning modesty about
this last remark." Also says, "I've found the 'Philosopher's Tone.'"
(What screaming fun H-xl-y always is!)

My Portraits.

Perhaps I may be allowed to say one word as to the Photographs preceding
these volumes. They aren't the least little bit like me! In
Volume One I appear as the unmistakable "Country Butcher." In Volume Two
I am "The Gorilla Asleep," or "Beetle-brow Napping" (after a
beetle-hunt, probably). Volume Three represents me as the Typical
Brigand of Transpontine Melodrama.

Why, too, has the Photographer insisted on bringing out that unfortunate
feature of mine so prominently?

Why? indeed! Who nose?



THE LARKS AND THE ROSES.

(Ballad, by Milton Featherly Jonsone.)





Rose on the Swell.




The roses were blowing, like whales in the sea
Where the apple-bloom icebergs plunged fearless and free,
And the larks carolled madly their high jubilee
        In the ether.
The daisies ran riot in sunshine and shade,
And the call of the cuckoo was heard from the glade,
Where Summer with mellow monotony play'd
        On her zither.


Tempo di Valse.


Ho, larks and roses!
  Hey, the bonny weather!
Hey, we rose at morning prime;
  Ho, we lark'd together!


'Mid roses and larks in our shallop we glide
By Inglesham poplars, on Teddington's tide,
Where the water of Thame under Sinodun slide,
                 And at Marlow,
By Cliveden's green caverns, and Abingdon's walls,
Where wirgles the Windrush, where Eynsham weir falls,
By Sonning, or Sandford (whose lasher recalls
                Mr. Barlow).


Con tenerezza.


Oh, larks, and ro(w)ses
  On the shining river;
Silver water-lilies, love;
  Love will last for ever!


But the blooms turn'd to apples for urchins to munch,
  And the roses were sold at a penny a bunch,
And the larks were served up for an Alderman's lunch,
                Dead and cold, love;
And the lustre has faded from tresses and cheek,
And the eyes do not sparkle, the eyes that I seek,
And the temper is strong and the logic is weak
                Of my old love.

THE PALACE OF (ADVERTISING) ART.

(A Long Way After the Laureate.)



I found myself a huckster's pleasure-place,
  Wherein 'twas horrible to dwell.
I said, "O Soul, the object of our race
      Is ever one       to sell."


A huge-walled wilderness of ways it was,
  With hoardings of exceeding height,
Which no one without pangs of fear, could pass,
      And spasms of affright.


Its purpose, though, was plain; 'twas simply pelf;
  Whether a woman wild of glare,
Or a colossal man shaving himself,
      All, all meant money there.


"And while the world rolls round and round," I said,
  "Advertisement is the one thing
Which need concern the wise and worldly head
			Of huckster, histrio, king."


To which my soul made answer readily,       
  "In patience I must fain abide
In these vast vistas of vulgarity.
      Stretching on every side."







Full of long-reaching bulks of board it was,
  Where, glaring forth from ghostly gloom,
Were gibbering monkeys grinning in a glass,
      In a dame's dressing-room.


And some were hung with daubs of green and blue,
  As gaudy as a cheap Cremorne,
Where actors postured in the public view,
      Some frantic, some forlorn.


One seemed all glare and gore       a stabbing hand,
  A woman flopping with a groan;
An ill-drawn idiot trying to look grand,
      Big-nosed, and high in bone.


One showed an ochre coast and emerald waves;
  You seemed to see them rise and fall,
As infant supers       wretched little slaves       
      Under the canvass crawl.


And one a full-faced, flashed comedian       low       
  Showing his teeth, with nervous strain,
With queer goggle-eyes striking like a blow,
      And causing quite a pain.


And one a miser, hoarding fruits of toil,
  In front a bony beak, behind,
Wisps of grey hairs all destitute of oil,
      Blown hoary on the wind.


And one a foreground with three hideous hags,
  Each twice as tall as life, or higher,
Medusa-monsters, clothed in wretched rags,
      And crouching round a fire.


And one an English home       lantern-light poured
  On a forced safe, skeleton keys,
Whilst gloating o'er the family plate there stored,
      Glowered the murderer, Peace.


Nor these alone, but everything to scare,
  Fit for each morbid mood of mind;
Murder and misery, want and woe were there
      As large as life designed.







There was a fellow in a pretty fix,
  "Tied to a corpse," all wild alarm,
Struggling across a sort of sooty Styx,
      The "body" on his arm.


Or in a snow-choked city wretchedly,
  Dead babe at breast, with bare blown hair,
A ruined woman crawled with quivering knee;
      Two bobbies scowled at her.


Or, posing in a footlight paradise,
  A group of Houris smirked to see
Young fools with clapping hands and ogling eyes
      Which said, "We come for ye!"


Or else a lost and deeply wounded one,
  In a wild swamp all bilious greens,
Came on a corpse a bare branch dangling on;
      The ghastliest of scenes!


Holloaed a half-choked boy with horrid fear,
  A brute the rope about to draw;
A second with a knife and axe was near
      To give the first Lynch Law.


Or in a railway-tunnel, iron rail'd,
  A man lay bound; his blood ran ice
Who looked thereon, an engine shrieked; he paled,
      And fainted in a trice.


A monkey by her hair a woman clasp'd;
  From her poor head it seemed half torn,
One ape-hand dragged it back; the other grasp'd
      A steel blade's haft of horn.


A hideous babe in nauseous nudity,
  Huge-headed, grinning like a clown,
Advertised Soap. A vile monstrosity,
      The terror of the Town!


Nor these alone; but every horror rare,
  Which the sensation-poisoned mind.
Imaged to advertise vile trash, was there       
      As large as life design'd.







Deep dread and loathing of these horrors crude,
  Fell on my Soul, hard to be borne,
She cried, "Why should these incubi intrude
      And plague us night and morn?


"What! is not this a civilised town," she said,
  "A spacious city, cultured, free?
Why give it up to dismalness and dread,
      Murder and misery?"


In every corner of that city stood,
  Unholy shapes, and spectral scares,
And fiends, and phantoms, brutal scenes of blood,
      And horrible nightmares.


"We are shut up as in a tomb, girt round
  With charnel scenes on every wall;
Wherever echoes of town-traffic sound,
      Or human footsteps fall.


She cried, "By Jove, it is a pretty game
  That Man, the Advertiser's thrall,
Should have these scenes of grimness, gore, and shame,
      Shock him from every wall.


"The very cab-horses go wild with fears!
  I rather fancy it is time
To stop these poster-terrors, placard-tears,
      And advertising crimes.


"Yes, yes, pull down these pictured screens that are
  All dedicate to gore and guilt.
Not solely for Soap-vendor or Stage-star
      Was our big Babylon built!

VOCES POPULI.

Scene       A Promenade Concert. Interval
between Parts I. and II.
Crowd collecting before Platform.

Highly Respectable Matron (to female Friend). As to being
beautiful,
it's not for me to say, but they're clean-limbed, healthy
children, thank Heaven! and what more do you want? (The Friend
makes a complimentary protest.) Well, it may be so; but, to come
back to her. I don't like her present home so well as I did her
first       not
so tasty, to my mind. She's got nice things about her, though,
I will say       a nice sideboard, a nice ... (Inventory follows
here.)

The Friend (darkly). All the same, it's a constant wonder to me
how she can ever bring herself to sleep in that bed!

The H. R. M. I couldn't myself; but (charitably) we've not
all
the same feelings. (Crush increases; Female Promenader with very
yellow hair passes, with apologies.) "Excuse me, Madame" (with
attempt at mimicry); ah       and she needs it! The orchestra's
coming
back now. I didn't notice that young woman among them before       what's
she going to play, I wonder?

The Friend. Whatever it is, she might look more pleasant over it!

The H. R. M. So she might       we can't all be good-looking, but
we can all be pleasant       but they wouldn't have engaged her here, if
she hadn't her gift!

The Friend. Oh, you may depend on it, she's got a gift       but I do
call her plain, myself.

A Man with a very red nose (to Companion). And then, you see,
I've this special advantage       my immense knowledge of the world.
Think there's time for another before they begin again, eh?

[Companion is of that opinion; adjournment to bar of house.

Second Part begins; Lady Vocalist retiring after Song.

First Promenader. Brayvo! Engcore! What, she won't sing no
more       sssh!      [Hisses furiously.

The H. R. M. There's the orchestra themselves clapping her       and
they'd know what's good.

Her Friend. She was dressed very nice, I thought.

The H. R. M. I never care to see hair done up that style myself.

On the Platform.

Ladies of Chorus tripping up from below Stage for the Vocal
Valse.

Ladies of Chorus (all together). Am I too black under the eyes,
dear? Mind where you're going, Miss, please! Treading on people's
toes like that       the great clumsy thing! I'm next to you, aren't I?
I do feel so funny, my dear, don't you? For goodness sake, don't
go setting me on the giggle now!

[They range themselves modestly in a row at edge of platform.

Rude Person (in upper box with Punch squeak). Rooti-too-ti!

[Roars of laughter.

Ladies of C. (indignantly). Beast! I wish they'd give him
something to make him rooti-toot, I do!

Conductor-Composer (from behind). Now, Ladies, ready please       keep
the laugh steadier than you did last time, and wait for me at
the repeat!

[He taps on desk: each Lady of Chorus stiffens herself perceptibly
and makes a little grimace.

One Lady (in whisper), Oh, dear, I wish I was at
home with my Ma!     [Her companions giggle.

The H. R. M. It's as much as they can do to sing for
laughing       they're
called "Laughing Beauties," though. I like this one's face
up at this end       she's so quiet and lady-like over it, and pretty too;
they put all the pretty ones in front, but there's one quite an old
woman behind. They're having all the fun down at the other end       how
they are going on, to be sure!

[End of Vocal Valse: loud applause. Ladies of Chorus retire
after encore with air of graceful dignity.

The Person with the Squeak. Goo'-bye, duckies!

[Roars of laughter again: renewed indignation among Chorus.
Person with Squeak feels like Sheridan
and Theodore
Hook rolled into one.

In the Grand Circle.

A Young Gentleman (who has set himself to form his fianc        e's
mind, but finds it necessary to proceed very gradually). Now,
Caroline,
tell me       isn't this better than if we had gone to the Circus?

Caroline (from the provinces; unmusical; simple in her tastes).
Yes, Joseph, only       (timidly)       there's
more of what I call variety in a Circus       more going on, I mean.

The Y. G. (with a sense of discouragement). I quite see your
meaning, dear, and it's an entirely true observation; still, you
do appreciate this magnificent orchestra, don't you now?

Caroline. I should have liked it better with different coloured
curtains       maize is so trying.

The Y. G. (mentally). I won't write home to them about it
just yet.

Orchestra begins a "Musical Medley" with Overture to
"Tannh      user."

The Y. G. (who has lost his programme). Now,  span
class="smcap">Caroline       this
is Wagner       you'll like  span
class="smcap">Wagner, darling, I'm sure.

Caroline (startled). Shall I? Where is he? Will he come in
here? Must I speak to him?

The Y. G. No, no       he's dead       I mean, this is from his
Opera       you
must listen to this.

[He watches her face for the emotion he expects; "Tannh      user"
melts suddenly into "Tommy, Make Room for your Uncle."

Caroline (her face absolutely transfigured). Oh,  span
class="smcap">Joseph, dear       Wagner's
perfectly lovely!

The Y. G. (gloomily). I see, I shall have to put you through a
course of Bach,  span
class="smcap">Caroline!

Caroline (alarmed). But there's nothing whatever the
matter with
me, Joseph! I'm not flushed am I?

[Young Gentleman suppresses a groan.

In a Box.

(Musical Medley still in progress.)

A Lady (not much of an Opera-goer, who has been given a box at
the last moment, and has insisted on her husband turning out to escort
her). It was silly of you to drop that programme,  span
class="smcap">Robert       I should
like to know what this piece is, it seems quite familiar       (Orchestra
playing "Soldiers' March" from Faust)       I know       it's Faust,
Robert,  span
class="smcap">Gounod's Faust!

[Much pleased with herself for recollecting an Opera she has only
heard once.

Robert (sleepily). I know, my dear, all right.

[Faust melts into air from "Pinafore."

His Wife. Do you mean to say you don't remember that,  span
class="smcap">Robert?
how exquisite Patti was in the part, to be
sure!

Robert. Umph!

["Pinafore" becomes "La ci darem"       which transforms itself
without warning into "Two Lovely Black Eyes."

The Lady. There's nobody like Gounod!
  [Clasps her hands.

Robert (captiously). Gounod's all very
well, I daresay, my dear;
but it don't seem to me he's altogether original. I've heard
something
very like this tune before, and I'll swear it wasn't by him!

The Lady. That's very likely; all the best airs get stolen
nowadays,
and dressed up so as to be quite unrecognisable; but that's not
Gounod's fault, is it?

[Fans herself triumphantly, after vindicating her favourite
Composer. Robert slumbers.

Behind the Platform.

Erratic Promenader. Beg your pardon, Sir       tha' shtick, not
'tended meet your eye, Sir       'nother gerrilm'n's eye, Sir.

Fair Promenader (to Lady Friend). And I'm sure I don't know
how it is, but I'm always crying now for just nothing at all, whenever
I'm alone.

The Lady Friend. That's because you give way to it, dear. Come
and have something to cheer you up       you'll be a different person
after it.                     [Advice taken; prediction verified.

The Err. Prom. I shay, here'sh lark! see tha' Bobby over there?
he thinksh I'm tight! (Waltzes up to him solemnly). Kn'ive
pleshure nexsht dansh you, Sir Charlesh?

The Policeman (severely). You keep your 'ands off of me, will
you, and take yourself home       that's my advice to you!

Err. Prom. (outraged). You 'pear me to under 'preshionthish is
Hy' Par' or Trafa              (with an effort)       Trafa-ralgarar Square. I'm
goin' teash you, free Briton not goin' put up with P'lice brurality!

[Hits Policeman in the eye, and is removed, smiling feebly.
Scene changes.



An Open Question.


Lord Solly, at Paddies presuming to rail,
Must sneer at their "brogue," which the Markis finds stale.
Does he think a poor fellow must fain be a rogue
Because, born in Erin, he speaks with a brogue?
Celtic ears finds the drawl of the Saxon Swell flat,
And a Cockney may chaff at the patois of Pat.
But which is in fault       is it really so clear?       
The Irishman's tongue, or the Englishman's ear?




In a recent case on appeal, Hammond       Co.
v. Bussey, Mr. Justice  span
class="smcap">Bowen was understood (by Our Special Reporter) to
say that a judgment relating to coals must be decided by the principles
of Coke. The Master of the Rolls and Mr.
Justice Fry concurred; the latter observing
that in winter a coal merchant must always be a  span
class="smcap">Bussey person, though his Lordship admitted that
this had nothing to do with the case. The Master of the Rolls and Mr.
Justice Bowen at once concurred.








NOTICE.       Rejected Communications or Contributions,
whether MS., Printed Matter, Drawings, or Pictures of any description,
will in no case be returned, not even when accompanied by a Stamped and
Addressed Envelope, Cover, or Wrapper. To this rule there will be no

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
