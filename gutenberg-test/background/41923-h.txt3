        Chapter I. The Myth Of
        Osiris.

        

        
          
            Osiris the Egyptian counterpart of
            Adonis and Attis.
          
        

        In ancient Egypt
        the god whose death and resurrection were annually celebrated with
        alternate sorrow and joy was Osiris, the most popular of all Egyptian
        deities; and there are good grounds for classing him in one of his
        aspects with Adonis and Attis as a personification of the great
        yearly vicissitudes of nature, especially of the corn. But the
        immense vogue which he enjoyed for many ages induced his devoted
        worshippers to heap upon him the attributes and powers of many other
        gods; so that it is not always easy to strip him, so to say, of his
        borrowed plumes and to restore them to their proper owners. In the
        following pages I do not pretend to enumerate and analyse all the
        alien elements which thus gathered round the popular deity. All that
        I shall attempt to do is to peel off these accretions and to exhibit
        the god, as far as possible, in his primitive simplicity. The
        discoveries of recent years in Egypt enable us to do so with more
        confidence now than when I first addressed myself to the problem many
        years ago.

        

        
          
            The myth of Osiris. The Pyramid
            Texts.
          
        

        The story of
        Osiris is told in a connected form only by Plutarch, whose narrative
        has been confirmed and to some extent amplified in modern times by
        the evidence of the monuments. a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1"
        href="#note_1"> span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1 Of the
        monuments which illustrate [pg
        004] the
        myth or legend of Osiris the oldest are a long series of hymns,
        prayers, incantations, and liturgies, which have been found engraved
        in hieroglyphics on the walls, passages, and galleries of five
        pyramids at Sakkara. From the place where they were discovered these
        ancient religious records are known as the Pyramid Texts. They date
        from the fifth and sixth dynasties, and the period of time during
        which they were carved on the pyramids is believed to have been
        roughly a hundred and fifty years from about the year 2625
         span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c. onward. But from their
        contents it appears that many of these documents were drawn up much
        earlier; for in some of them there are references to works which have
        perished, and in others there are political allusions which seem to
        show that the passages containing them must have been composed at a
        time when the Northern and Southern Kingdoms were still independent
        and hostile states and had not yet coalesced into a single realm
        under the sway of one powerful monarch. As the union of the kingdoms
        appears to have taken place about three thousand four hundred years
        before our era, the whole period covered by the composition of the
        Pyramid Texts probably did not fall short of a thousand years. Thus
        the documents form the oldest body of religious literature surviving
        to us from the ancient world, and occupy a place in the history of
        Egyptian language and civilization like that which the Vedic hymns
        and incantations occupy in the history of Aryan speech and
        culture. a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href=
        "#note_2"> span style=

            The Pyramid Texts intended to ensure
            the blissful immortality of Egyptian kings.
          
        

        The special
        purpose for which these texts were engraved on the pyramids was to
        ensure the eternal life and felicity of the dead kings who slept
        beneath these colossal monuments.  span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page005">[pg 005] a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"> Hence the dominant note that sounds through
        them all is an insistent, a passionate protest against the reality of
        death: indeed the word death never occurs in the Pyramid Texts except
        to be scornfully denied or to be applied to an enemy. Again and again
        the indomitable assurance is repeated that the dead man did not die
        but lives. “King Teti has not died the death,
        he has become a glorious one in the horizon.”  span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ho! King Unis! Thou didst not depart dead, thou didst
        depart living.” “Thou hast departed
        that thou mightest live, thou hast not departed that thou mightest
        die.” “Thou diest not.”
        “This King Pepi dies not.”
        “Have ye said that he would die? He dies not;
        this King Pepi lives for ever.” “Live!
        Thou shalt not die.” “Thou livest,
        thou livest, raise thee up.” “Thou
        diest not, stand up, raise thee up.”  span class=
        "tei tei-q">“O lofty one among the Imperishable Stars, thou perishest
        not eternally.” a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href=
        "#note_3"> span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3 Thus for
        Egyptian kings death was swallowed up in victory; and through their
        tears Egyptian mourners might ask, like Christian mourners thousands
        of years afterwards, “O death, where is thy
        sting? O grave, where is thy victory?”

        

        
          
            The story of Osiris in the Pyramid
            Texts.
          
        

        Now it is
        significant that in these ancient documents, though the myth or
        legend of Osiris is not set forth at length, it is often alluded to
        as if it were a matter of common knowledge. Hence we may legitimately
        infer the great antiquity of the Osirian tradition in Egypt. Indeed
        so numerous are the allusions to it in the Pyramid Texts that by
        their help we could reconstruct the story in its main outlines even
        without the narrative of Plutarch. a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4"
        href="#note_4"> span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4 Thus the
        discovery of these texts has confirmed our belief in the accuracy and
        fidelity of the Greek writer, and we may accept his account with
        confidence even when it records incidents or details which have not
        yet been verified by a [pg
        006]
        comparison with original Egyptian sources. The tragic tale runs
        thus:

        

        
          
            Osiris a son of the earth-god and
            the sky-goddess.
          
        

        Osiris was the
        offspring of an intrigue between the earth-god Seb (Keb or Geb, as
        the name is sometimes transliterated) and the sky-goddess Nut. The
        Greeks identified his parents with their own deities Cronus and Rhea.
        When the sun-god Ra perceived that his wife Nut had been unfaithful
        to him, he declared with a curse that she should be delivered of the
        child in no month and no year. But the goddess had another lover, the
        god Thoth or Hermes, as the Greeks called him, and he playing at
        draughts with the moon won from her a seventy-second part a id=
        "noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"> span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"> span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5 of every
        day, and having compounded five whole days out of these parts he
        added them to the Egyptian year of three hundred and sixty days. This
        was the mythical origin of the five supplementary days which the
        Egyptians annually inserted at the end of every year in order to
        establish a harmony between lunar and solar time. a id="noteref_6"

        Reigning as a king
        on earth, Osiris reclaimed the Egyptians from savagery, gave them
        laws, and taught them to worship the gods. Before his time the
        Egyptians had been cannibals. But Isis, the sister and wife of
        Osiris, discovered wheat and barley growing wild, and Osiris
        introduced the cultivation of these grains amongst his people, who
        forthwith abandoned cannibalism and took kindly to a corn diet.
        Moreover, Osiris is said to have been the first to gather fruit from
        trees, to train the vine to poles, and to tread the grapes. Eager to
        communicate these beneficent discoveries to all mankind, he committed
        the whole government of Egypt to his wife Isis, and travelled over
        the world, diffusing the blessings of civilization and agriculture
        wherever he went. In countries where a harsh climate or niggardly
        soil forbade the cultivation of the vine, he taught the inhabitants
        to console themselves for the want of wine by brewing beer from
        barley. Loaded with the wealth that had been showered upon him by
        grateful nations, he returned to Egypt, and on account of the
        benefits he had conferred on mankind he was unanimously hailed and
        worshipped as a deity. a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href=

            She takes refuge in the papyrus
            swamps. Isis and her infant son Horus.
          
        

        By the advice of
        the god of wisdom she took refuge in the papyrus swamps of the Delta.
        Seven scorpions accompanied her in her flight. One evening when she
        was weary she came to the house of a woman, who, alarmed at the sight
        of the scorpions, shut the door in her face. Then one of the
        scorpions crept under the door and stung the child of the woman that
        he died. But when Isis heard the mother's lamentation, her heart was
        touched, and she laid her hands on the child and uttered her powerful
        spells; so the poison was driven out of the child and he lived.
        Afterwards Isis herself gave birth to a son in the swamps. She had
        conceived him while she fluttered in the form of a hawk over the
        corpse of her dead husband. The infant was the younger Horus, who in
        his youth bore the name of Harpocrates, that is, the child Horus. Him
        Buto, the goddess of the north, hid from the wrath of his wicked
        uncle Set. Yet she could not guard him from all mishap; for one day
        when Isis came to her little son's hiding-place she found him
        stretched lifeless and rigid on the ground: a scorpion had stung him.
        Then Isis prayed to the sun-god Ra for help. The god hearkened to her
        and staid his bark in the sky, and sent down Thoth to teach her the
        spell by which she might restore her son to life. She uttered the
        words of power, and straightway the poison flowed from the body of
        Horus, air passed into him, and he lived. Then Thoth ascended up into
        the sky and took his place once more in the bark of the sun, and the
        bright pomp passed onward jubilant. a id="noteref_10" name=

        shot up suddenly and enclosed the chest in its trunk. The king of the
        country, admiring the growth of the tree, had it cut down and made
        into a pillar of his house; but he did not know that the coffer with
        the dead Osiris was in it. Word of this came to Isis and she
        journeyed to Byblus, and sat down by the well, in humble guise, her
        face wet with tears. To none would she speak till the king's
        handmaidens came, and them she greeted kindly, and braided their
        hair, and breathed on them from her own divine body a wondrous
        perfume. But when the queen beheld the braids of her handmaidens'
        hair and smelt the sweet smell that emanated from them, she sent for
        the stranger woman and took her into her house and made her the nurse
        of her child. But Isis gave the babe her finger instead of her breast
        to suck, and at night she began to burn all that was mortal of him
        away, while she herself in the likeness of a swallow fluttered round
        the pillar that contained her dead brother, twittering mournfully.
        But the queen spied what she was doing and shrieked out when she saw
        her child in flames, and thereby she hindered him from becoming
        immortal. Then the goddess revealed herself and begged for the pillar
        of the roof, and they gave it her, and she cut the coffer out of it,
        and fell upon it and embraced it and lamented so loud that the
        younger of the king's children died of fright on the spot. But the

        with her and sailed away. As soon as they were alone, she opened the
        chest, and laying her face on the face of her brother she kissed him
        and wept. But the child came behind her softly and saw what she was
        about, and she turned and looked at him in anger, and the child could
        not bear her look and died; but some say that it was not so, but that
        he fell into the sea and was drowned. It is he whom the Egyptians
        sing of at their banquets under the name of Maneros. But Isis put the
        coffer by and went to see her son Horus at the city of Buto, and
        Typhon found the coffer as he was hunting a boar one night by the

        “Isis,” writes the historian Diodorus
        Siculus, “recovered all the parts of the body
        except the genitals; and because she wished that her husband's grave
        should be unknown and honoured by all who dwell in the land of Egypt,
        she resorted to the following device. She moulded human images out of
        wax and spices, corresponding to the stature of Osiris, round each
        one of the parts of his body. Then she called in the priests
        according to their families and took an oath of them all that
        [pg 011] a name="Pg011"
        id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"> they would reveal to no man
        the trust she was about to repose in them. So to each of them
        privately she said that to them alone she entrusted the burial of the
        body, and reminding them of the benefits they had received she
        exhorted them to bury the body in their own land and to honour Osiris
        as a god. She also besought them to dedicate one of the animals of
        their country, whichever they chose, and to honour it in life as they
        had formerly honoured Osiris, and when it died to grant it obsequies
        like his. And because she would encourage the priests in their own
        interest to bestow the aforesaid honours, she gave them a third part
        of the land to be used by them in the service and worship of the
        gods. Accordingly it is said that the priests, mindful of the
        benefits of Osiris, desirous of gratifying the queen, and moved by
        the prospect of gain, carried out all the injunctions of Isis.
        Wherefore to this day each of the priests imagines that Osiris is
        buried in his country, and they honour the beasts that were
        consecrated in the beginning, and when the animals die the priests
        renew at their burial the mourning for Osiris. But the sacred bulls,
        the one called Apis and the other Mnevis, were dedicated to Osiris,
        and it was ordained that they should be worshipped as gods in common
        by all the Egyptians; since these animals above all others had helped
        the discoverers of corn in sowing the seed and procuring the
        universal benefits of agriculture.” a id="noteref_14" name=

        Such is the myth
        or legend of Osiris, as told by Greek writers and eked out by more or
        less fragmentary notices or allusions in native Egyptian literature.
        A long inscription in the temple at Denderah has preserved a list of
        the god's graves, and other texts mention the parts of his body which
        were treasured as holy relics in each of the sanctuaries. Thus his
        heart was at Athribis, his backbone at Busiris, his neck at
        Letopolis, and his head at Memphis. As often happens in such cases,
        some of his divine limbs were miraculously multiplied. His head, for
        example, was at Abydos as well as at Memphis, and his legs, which
        were remarkably numerous, would have sufficed for several ordinary
        mortals. a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href=

        Nephthys sat down beside it and uttered a lament which in after ages
        became the type of all Egyptian lamentations for the dead.

        “Come to thy house. O god On! come to thy

            Egyptians saw a pledge of their own immortality.
          
        

        In the
        resurrection of Osiris the Egyptians saw the pledge of a life
        everlasting for themselves beyond the grave. They believed that every
        man would live eternally in the other world if only his surviving
        friends did for his body what the gods had done for the body of
        Osiris. Hence the ceremonies observed by the Egyptians over the human
        dead were an exact copy of those which Anubis, Horus, and the rest
        had performed over the dead god. “At every
        burial there was enacted a representation of the divine mystery which
        had been performed of old over Osiris, when his son, his sisters, his
        friends were gathered round his mangled remains and succeeded by
        their spells and manipulations in converting his broken body into the
        first mummy, which they afterwards reanimated and furnished with the
        means of entering on a new individual life beyond the grave. The
        mummy of the deceased was Osiris; the professional female mourners
        were his two sisters Isis and Nephthys; Anubis, Horus, all the gods
        of the Osirian legend gathered about the corpse.” In this
        solemn drama of death and resurrection the principal part was played
        by the celebrant, who represented Horus the son of the dead and
        resuscitated Osiris. a id="noteref_26" name="noteref_26" href=

        opening the mouth of the mummy or of the statue with certain
        instruments specially reserved for the purpose. Geese and gazelles
        were also sacrificed by being decapitated; they were supposed to
        represent the enemies of Osiris, who after the murder of the divine
        man had sought to evade the righteous punishment of their crime but
        had been detected and beheaded. a id="noteref_27" name="noteref_27"

        Thus every dead
        Egyptian was identified with Osiris and bore his name. From the
        Middle Kingdom onwards it was the regular practice to address the
        deceased as “Osiris So-and-So,” as if
        he were the god himself, and to add the standing epithet  span class=

        Osiris died and rose again from the dead, so all men hoped to arise
        like him from death to life eternal. In an Egyptian text it is said
        of the departed that “as surely as Osiris
        lives, so shall he live also; as surely as Osiris did not die, so
        shall he not die; as surely as Osiris is not annihilated, so shall he
        too not be annihilated.” The dead man, conceived to be lying,
        like Osiris, with mangled body, was comforted by being told that the
        heavenly goddess Nut, the mother of Osiris, was coming to gather up
        his poor scattered limbs and mould them with her own hands into a
        form immortal and divine. “She gives thee thy
        head, she brings thee thy bones, she sets thy limbs together and puts
        thy heart in thy body.” Thus the resurrection of the dead was
        conceived, like that of Osiris, not merely as spiritual but also as
        bodily. “They possess their heart, they
        possess their senses, they possess their mouth, they possess their
        feet, they possess their arms, they possess all their

            Combat between Set and Horus, the
            brother and the son of Osiris, for the crown of Egypt.
          
        

        If we may trust
        Egyptian legend, the trials and contests of the royal house did not
        cease with the restoration of Osiris  span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page017">[pg 017] a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"> to life and his elevation to the rank of
        presiding deity in the world of the dead. When Horus the younger, the
        son of Osiris and Isis, was grown to man's estate, the ghost of his
        royal and murdered father appeared to him and urged him, like another
        Hamlet, to avenge the foul unnatural murder upon his wicked uncle.
        Thus encouraged, the youth attacked the miscreant. The combat was
        terrific and lasted many days. Horus lost an eye in the conflict and
        Set suffered a still more serious mutilation. At last Thoth parted
        the combatants and healed their wounds; the eye of Horus he restored
        by spitting on it. According to one account the great battle was
        fought on the twenty-sixth day of the month of Thoth. Foiled in open
        war, the artful uncle now took the law of his virtuous nephew. He
        brought a suit of bastardy against Horus, hoping thus to rob him of
        his inheritance and to get possession of it himself; nay, not content
        with having murdered his good brother, the unnatural Set carried his
        rancour even beyond the grave by accusing the dead Osiris of certain
        high crimes and misdemeanours. The case was tried before the supreme
        court of the gods in the great hall at Heliopolis. Thoth, the god of
        wisdom, pleaded the cause of Osiris, and the august judges decided
        that “the word of Osiris was true.”
        Moreover, they pronounced Horus to be the true-begotten son of his
        father. So that prince assumed the crown and mounted the throne of
        the lamented Osiris. However, according to another and perhaps later
        version of the story, the victory of Horus over his uncle was by no
        means so decisive, and their struggles ended in a compromise, by
        which Horus reigned over the Delta, while Set became king of the
        upper valley of the Nile from near Memphis to the first cataract. Be
        that as it may, with the accession of Horus began for the Egyptians
        the modern period of the world, for on his throne all the kings of
        Egypt sat as his successors. a id="noteref_31" name="noteref_31"

        dynastical struggles which attended an attempt to change the right of
        succession from the female to the male line. For under a rule of
        female kinship the heir to the throne is either the late king's
        brother, or the son of the late king's sister, while under a rule of
        male kinship the heir to the throne is the late king's son. In the
        legend of Osiris the rival heirs are Set and Horus, Set being the
        late king's brother, and Horus the late king's son; though Horus
        indeed united both claims to the crown, being the son of the king's
        sister as well as of the king. A similar attempt to shift the line of
        succession seems to have given rise to similar contests at
        Rome. a id="noteref_32" name="noteref_32" href=

        Thus according to
        what seems to have been the general native tradition Osiris was a
        good and beloved king of Egypt, who suffered a violent death but rose
        from the dead and was henceforth worshipped as a deity. In harmony
        with this tradition he was regularly represented by sculptors and
        painters in human and regal form as a dead king, swathed in the
        wrappings of a mummy, but wearing on his head a kingly crown and
        grasping in one of his hands, which were left free from the bandages,
        a kingly sceptre. a id="noteref_33" name="noteref_33" href=

        Encircled by the nimbus of the dead yet living god, Abydos,

        the wish of every pious man that his dead body should rest in
        hallowed earth near the grave of the glorified Osiris. Few indeed
        were rich enough to enjoy this inestimable privilege; for, apart from
        the cost of a tomb in the sacred city, the mere transport of mummies
        from great distances was both difficult and expensive. Yet so eager
        were many to absorb in death the blessed influence which radiated
        from the holy sepulchre that they caused their surviving friends to
        convey their mortal remains to Abydos, there to tarry for a short
        time, and then to be brought back by river and interred in the tombs
        which had been made ready for them in their native land. Others had
        cenotaphs built or memorial tablets erected for themselves near the
        tomb of their dead and risen Lord, that they might share with him the
        bliss of a joyful resurrection. a id="noteref_35" name="noteref_35"

        ages identified him with Osiris in a more intimate sense than that in
        which the divine title was lavished on every dead king and indeed on
        every dead man; for his tomb was actually converted into the tomb of
        Osiris and as such received in great profusion the offerings of the
        faithful. Somewhere between the twenty-second and the twenty-sixth
        dynasty a massive bier of grey granite was placed in the sepulchral
        chamber. On it, cut in high relief, reposes a shrouded figure of the
        dead Osiris. He lies at full length, with bare and upturned face. On
        his head is the White Crown of Upper Egypt; in his hands, which issue
        from the shroud, he holds the characteristic emblems of the god, the
        sceptre and the scourge. At the four corners of the bier are perched
        four hawks, representing the four children of Horus, each with their
        father's banner, keeping watch over the dead god, as they kept watch
        over the four quarters of the world. A fifth hawk seems to have been
        perched on the middle of the body of Osiris, but it had been broken
        off before the tomb was discovered in recent years, for only the
        bird's claws remain in position. Finely carved heads of lions, one at
        each corner of the bier, with the claws to match below, complete the
        impressive monument. The scene represented is unquestionably the
        impregnation of Isis in the form of a hawk by the dead Osiris; the
        Copts who dismantled the shrine appear to have vented their pious
        rage on the figure of the hawk Isis by carrying it off or smashing
        it. If any doubt could exist as to the meaning of these sculptured
        figures, it would be set at rest by the ancient inscriptions attached
        to them. Over against the right shoulder of the shrouded figure, who
        lies stretched on the bier, are carved in hieroglyphics the words,
        “Osiris, the  span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        against the place where the missing hawk perched on the body of the
        dead god is carved the symbol of Isis. Two relics of the ancient
        human occupants of the tomb escaped alike the fury of the fanatics
        and the avarice of the plunderers who pillaged and destroyed it. One
        of the relics is a human skull, from which the lower jawbone is
        missing; the other is an arm encircled by gorgeous jewelled bracelets
        of gold, turquoises, amethysts, and dark purple lapis lazuli. The
        former may be the head of King Khent himself; the latter is almost
        certainly the arm of his queen. One of the bracelets is composed of

        Chapter II. The Official Egyptian
        Calendar.

        

        
          
            The date of a festival sometimes
            furnishes a clue to the nature of the god.
          
        

        A useful clue to
        the original nature of a god or goddess is often furnished by the
        season at which his or her festival is celebrated. Thus, if the
        festival falls at the new or the full moon, there is a certain
        presumption that the deity thus honoured either is the moon or at
        least has lunar affinities. If the festival is held at the winter or
        summer solstice, we naturally surmise that the god is the sun, or at
        all events that he stands in some close relation to that luminary.
        Again, if the festival coincides with the time of sowing or harvest,
        we are inclined to infer that the divinity is an embodiment of the
        earth or of the corn. These presumptions or inferences, taken by
        themselves, are by no means conclusive; but if they happen to be
        confirmed by other indications, the evidence may be regarded as
        fairly strong.

        

        
          
            The year of the Egyptian calendar a
            vague or movable one.
          
        

        Unfortunately, in
        dealing with the Egyptian gods we are in a great measure precluded
        from making use of this clue. The reason is not that the dates of the
        festivals are always unknown, but that they shifted from year to
        year, until after a long interval they had revolved through the whole
        course of the seasons. This gradual revolution of the festal Egyptian
        cycle resulted from the employment of a calendar year which neither
        corresponded exactly to the solar year nor was periodically corrected

        Thus the official

        from what may be called the natural calendar of the shepherd, the
        husbandman, and the sailor—that is, from the course of the seasons in
        which the times for the various labours of cattle-breeding, tillage,
        and navigation are marked by the position of the sun in the sky, the
        rising or setting of the stars, the fall of rain, the growth of
        pasture, the ripening of the corn, the blowing of certain winds, and
        so forth. Nowhere, perhaps, are the events of this natural calendar
        better marked or more regular in their recurrence than in Egypt;
        nowhere accordingly could their divergence from the corresponding

        acquainted with the true length of the solar year, and harmonized the

        into a fixed solar year by the intercalation of one day at the end of
        every four years, “in order that the seasons

            Institution of the fixed Alexandrian
            year by the Romans.
          
        

        The reform which
        the Macedonian king had vainly attempted to impose upon his people
        was accomplished by the practical Romans when they took over the
        administration [pg
        028] of
        the country. The expedient by which they effected the change was a
        simple one; indeed it was no other than that to which Ptolemy
        Euergetes had resorted for the same purpose. They merely intercalated
        one day at the end of every four years, thus equalizing within a
        small fraction four calendar years to four solar years. Henceforth
        the official and the natural calendars were in practical agreement.
        The movable Egyptian year had been converted into the fixed
        Alexandrian year, as it was called, which agreed with the Julian year
        in length and in its system of intercalation, though it differed from
        that year in retaining the twelve equal Egyptian months and five
        supplementary days. a id="noteref_54" name="noteref_54" href=

        Chapter III. The Calendar of the
        Egyptian Farmer.

        
           

          
          § 1. The Rise and Fall of the
          Nile.

          

          
            
              In Egypt the operations of
              husbandry are dependent on the annual rise and fall of the
              Nile.
            
          

          If the Egyptian
          farmer of the olden time could thus get no help, except at the
          rarest intervals, from the official or sacerdotal calendar, he must
          have been compelled to observe for himself those natural signals
          which marked the times for the various operations of husbandry. In
          all ages of which we possess any records the Egyptians have been an
          agricultural people, dependent for their subsistence on the growth
          of the corn. The cereals which they cultivated were wheat, barley,
          and apparently sorghum ( span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"

          as now the whole country, with the exception of a fringe on the
          coast of the Mediterranean, was almost rainless, and owed its
          immense fertility entirely to the annual inundation of the Nile,
          which, regulated by an elaborate system of dams and canals, was
          distributed over the fields, renewing the soil year by year with a
          fresh deposit of mud washed down from the great equatorial lakes
          and the mountains of Abyssinia. Hence the rise of the river has
          always been watched by the inhabitants with the utmost anxiety; for
          if it either falls short of or exceeds a certain height, dearth and
          famine are the inevitable consequences. a id="noteref_58" name=

          July that it swells to a mighty tide. By the end of September the
          inundation is at its greatest height. The country is now submerged,
          and presents the appearance of a sea of turbid water, from which
          the towns and villages, built on higher ground, rise like islands.
          For about a month the flood remains nearly stationary, then sinks
          more and more rapidly, till by December or January the river has
          returned to its ordinary bed. With the approach of summer the level
          of the water continues to fall. In the early days of June the Nile
          is reduced to half its ordinary breadth; and Egypt, scorched by the
          sun, blasted by the wind that has blown from the Sahara for many
          days, seems a mere continuation of the desert. The trees are choked
          with a thick layer of grey dust. A few meagre patches of
          vegetables, watered with difficulty, struggle painfully for
          existence in the immediate neighbourhood of the villages. Some
          appearance of verdure lingers beside the canals and in the hollows
          from which the moisture has not wholly evaporated. The plain
          appears to pant in the pitiless sunshine, bare, dusty,
          ash-coloured, cracked and seamed as far as the eye can see with a
          network of fissures. From the middle of April till the middle of
          June the land of Egypt is but half alive, waiting for the new
          Nile. a id="noteref_59" name="noteref_59" href=

              Irrigation, sowing, and harvest in
              Egypt.
            
          

          For countless
          ages this cycle of natural events has determined the annual labours
          of the Egyptian husbandman. The first work of the agricultural year
          is the cutting [pg
          032]
          of the dams which have hitherto prevented the swollen river from
          flooding the canals and the fields. This is done, and the pent-up
          waters released on their beneficent mission, in the first half of
          August. a id="noteref_60" name="noteref_60" href=
          "#note_60"> span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">60 In
          November, when the inundation has subsided, wheat, barley, and
          sorghum are sown. The time of harvest varies with the district,
          falling about a month later in the north than in the south. In
          Upper or Southern Egypt barley is reaped at the beginning of March,
          wheat at the beginning of April, and sorghum about the end of that
          month. a id="noteref_61" name="noteref_61" href=

              The events of the agricultural
              year were probably celebrated with religious rites.
            
          

          It is natural to
          suppose that these various events of the agricultural year were
          celebrated by the Egyptian farmer with some simple religious rites
          designed to secure the blessing of the gods upon his labours. These
          rustic ceremonies he would continue to perform year after year at
          the same season, while the solemn festivals of the priests
          continued to shift, with the shifting calendar, from summer through
          spring to winter, and so backward through autumn to summer. The
          rites of the husbandman were stable because they rested on direct
          observation of nature: the rites of the priest were unstable
          because they were based on a false calculation. Yet many of the
          priestly festivals may have been nothing but the old rural
          festivals disguised in the course of ages by the pomp of
          sacerdotalism and severed, by the error of the calendar, from their
          roots in the natural cycle of the seasons.

              Mourning for Osiris at midsummer
              when the Nile begins to rise.
            
          

          These
          conjectures are confirmed by the little we know both of the popular
          and of the official Egyptian religion. Thus we are told that the
          Egyptians held a festival of Isis at the time when the Nile began
          to rise. They believed that the goddess was then mourning for the
          lost Osiris, and that the tears which dropped from her eyes swelled
          the impetuous tide of the river. a id="noteref_62" name=

          Similarly the Toradjas of Central Celebes imagine that showers of
          rain are the tears shed by the compassionate gods in weeping for
          somebody who is about to die; a shower in the morning is to them an
          infallible omen of death. a id="noteref_64" name="noteref_64" href=

          However, an uneasy suspicion would seem to have occurred to the
          Egyptians that perhaps after all the tears of the goddess might not
          suffice of themselves to raise the water to the proper level; so in
          the time of Rameses II. the king used on the first day of the flood
          to throw into the Nile a written order commanding the river to do
          its duty, and the submissive stream never failed to obey the royal
          mandate. a id="noteref_65" name="noteref_65" href=

          the ancient belief survives in a modified form to this day. For the
          Nile, as we saw, begins to rise in June about the time of the
          summer solstice, and the people still attribute its increased
          volume to a miraculous drop which falls into the river on the night
          of the seventeenth of the month. The charms and divinations which
          they practise on that mystic night in order to ascertain the length
          of their own life and to rid the houses of bugs may well date from
          a remote antiquity. a id="noteref_66" name="noteref_66" href=

          natural than that he should be mourned at midsummer. For by that
          time the harvest was past, the fields were bare, the river ran low,
          life seemed to be suspended, the corn-god was dead. At such a
          moment people who saw the handiwork of divine beings in all the
          operations of nature might well trace the swelling of the sacred
          stream to the tears shed by the goddess at the death of the
          beneficent corn-god her husband.

          

          
            
              Sirius regarded as the star of
              Isis. The rising of Sirius marked the beginning of the sacred
              Egyptian year. The observation of the gradual displacement of
              Sirius in the calendar led to the determination of the true
              length of the solar year.
            
          

          And the sign of
          the rising waters on earth was accompanied by a sign in heaven. For
          in the early days of Egyptian history, some three or four thousand
          years before the beginning of our era, the splendid star of Sirius,
          the brightest of all the fixed stars, appeared at dawn in the east
          just before sunrise about the time of the summer solstice, when the

          between the sixth and the sixteenth of August, and till lately was
          attended by ceremonies which deserve to be noticed, because they
          were probably handed down from antiquity. An ancient canal, known
          by the name of the Khalíj, formerly passed through the native town
          of Cairo. Near its entrance the canal was crossed by a dam of
          earth, very broad at the bottom and diminishing in breadth upwards,
          which used to be constructed before or soon after the Nile began to
          rise. In front of the dam, on the side of the river, was reared a
          truncated cone of earth called the  span class=

          "font-style: italic">'arooseh or  span class=

          millet was generally sown. This  span class=
          "tei tei-q">“bride” was commonly washed down by the rising
          tide a week or a fortnight before the cutting of the dam. Tradition
          runs that the old custom was to deck a young virgin in gay apparel
          and throw her into the river as a sacrifice to obtain a plentiful
          inundation. a id="noteref_74" name="noteref_74" href=

          Certainly human sacrifices were offered for a similar purpose by
          the Wajagga of German East Africa down to recent years. These
          people irrigate their fields by means of skilfully constructed
          channels, through which they conduct the water of the mountain
          brooks and rivers to the thirsty land. They imagine that the
          spirits of their forefathers dwell in the rocky basins of these
          rushing streams, and that they would resent the withdrawal of the
          water to irrigate the fields if compensation were not offered to
          them. The water-rate paid to them consisted of a child,
          uncircumcised and of unblemished body, who was decked with
          ornaments and bells and thrown into the river to drown, before they
          ventured to draw off the water into the irrigation channel. Having
          thrown him in, his executioners shewed a clean pair of heels,
          because they expected the river to rise in flood at once on receipt
          of the water-rate. a id="noteref_75" name="noteref_75" href=

          channel. The fat, dung, and blood of the animal are sprinkled at
          the mouth of the ditch and in the water; thereupon the dam is
          broken down and the stream pours into the ditch. The sacrifice may
          only be offered by a man of the Il Mayek clan, and for two days
          afterwards he wears the skin of the beast tied round his head. No
          one may quarrel with this man while the water is irrigating the
          crops, else the people believe that the water would cease to flow
          in the ditch; more than that, if the men of the Il Mayek clan were
          angry and sulked for ten days, the water would dry up permanently
          for that season. Hence the Il Mayek clan enjoys great consideration
          in the tribe, since the crops are thought to depend on their good
          will and good offices. Ten elders assist at the sacrifice of the
          sheep, though they may take no part in it. They must all be of a
          particular age; and after the ceremony they may not cohabit with

          irrigating the fields, nobody may kill waterbuck, eland, oryx,
          zebra, rhinoceros, or hippopotamus. Anybody caught red-handed in

              Modern Egyptian ceremony at the
              cutting of the dams.
            
          

          Whether the
          “bride” who used to figure at the
          ceremony of cutting the dam in Cairo was ever a live woman or not,
          the intention of the practice appears to have been to marry the
          river, conceived as a male power, to his bride the corn-land, which
          was soon to be fertilized by his water. The ceremony was therefore
          a charm to ensure the growth of the crops. As such it probably
          dated, in one form or another, from ancient times. Dense crowds
          assembled to witness the cutting of the dam. The operation was
          performed before sunrise, and many people spent the preceding night
          on the banks of the canal or in boats lit with lamps on the river,
          while fireworks were displayed and guns discharged at frequent
          intervals. Before sunrise a great number of workmen began to cut
          the dam, and the task was accomplished about an hour before the sun
          appeared on the [pg
          040]
          horizon. When only a thin ridge of earth remained, a boat with an
          officer on board was propelled against it, and breaking through the
          slight barrier descended with the rush of water into the canal. The
          Governor of Cairo flung a purse of gold into the boat as it passed.
          Formerly the custom was to throw money into the canal. The populace
          used to dive after it, and several lives were generally lost in the
          scramble. a id="noteref_77" name="noteref_77" href=

              The sowing of the seed in
              November. Plutarch on the mournful character of the rites of
              sowing. The sadness of autumn.
            
          

          The next great
          operation of the agricultural year in Egypt is the sowing of the
          seed in November, when the water of the inundation has retreated
          from the fields. With the Egyptians, as with many peoples of
          antiquity, the committing of the seed to the earth assumed the
          character of a solemn and mournful rite. On this subject I will let
          Plutarch speak for himself. “What,”
          he asks, “are we to make of the gloomy,
          joyless, and mournful sacrifices, if it is wrong either to omit the
          established rites or to confuse and disturb our conceptions of the
          gods by absurd suspicions? For the Greeks also perform many rites
          which resemble those of the Egyptians and are observed about the
          same time. Thus at the festival of the Thesmophoria in Athens
          [pg 041] a name=
          "Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"> women sit on the
          ground and fast. And the Boeotians open the vaults of the Sorrowful
          One, a id="noteref_80" name="noteref_80" href=
          "#note_80"> span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">80 naming
          that festival sorrowful because Demeter is sorrowing for the
          descent of the Maiden. The month is the month of sowing about the
          setting of the Pleiades. a id="noteref_81" name="noteref_81" href=
          "#note_81"> span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">81 The
          Egyptians call it Athyr, the Athenians Pyanepsion, the Boeotians
          the month of Demeter. Theopompus informs us that the western
          peoples consider and call the winter Cronus, the summer Aphrodite,
          and the spring Persephone, and they believe that all things are
          brought into being by Cronus and Aphrodite. The Phrygians imagine
          that the god sleeps in winter and wakes in summer, and accordingly
          they celebrate with Bacchic rites the putting him to bed in winter
          and his awakening in summer. The Paphlagonians allege that he is
          bound fast and shut up in winter, but that he stirs and is set free
          in spring. And the season furnishes a hint that the sadness is for
          the hiding of those fruits of the earth which the ancients
          esteemed, not indeed gods, but great and necessary gifts bestowed
          by the gods in order that men might not lead the life of savages
          and of wild beasts. For it was that time of year when they saw some
          of the fruits vanishing and falling from the trees, while they
          sowed others grudgingly and with difficulty, scraping the earth
          with their hands and huddling it up again, on the uncertain chance
          that what they deposited in the ground would ever ripen and come to
          maturity. Thus they did in many respects like those who bury and
          mourn their dead. And just as we say that a purchaser of Plato's
          books purchases Plato, or that an actor who plays the comedies of
          Menander plays Menander, so the men of old did not hesitate to call
          the gifts and products of the gods by the names of the gods
          themselves, thereby honouring and glorifying the things on account
          of their utility. But in [pg
          042]
          after ages simple folk in their ignorance applied to the gods
          statements which only held true of the fruits of the earth, and so
          they came not merely to say but actually to believe that the growth
          and decay of plants, on which they subsisted, a id="noteref_82"

          the birth and the death of gods. Thus they fell into absurd,
          immoral, and confused ways of thinking, though all the while the
          absurdity of the fallacy was manifest. Hence Xenophanes of Colophon
          declared that if the Egyptians deemed their gods divine they should
          not weep for them, and that if they wept for them they should not
          deem them divine. ‘For it is
          ridiculous,’ said he, ‘to lament and
          pray that the fruits would be good enough to grow and ripen again
          in order that they may again be eaten and lamented.’ But he
          was wrong, for though the lamentations are for the fruits, the
          prayers are addressed to the gods, as the causes and givers of
          them, that they would be pleased to make fresh fruits to spring up
          instead of those that perish.” a id="noteref_83" name=

              Plutarch's view that the worship
              of the fruits of the earth sprang from a verbal
              misunderstanding.
            
          

          In this
          interesting passage Plutarch expresses his belief that the worship
          of the fruits of the earth was the result of a verbal
          misapprehension or disease of language, as it has been called by a
          modern school of mythologists, who explain the origin of myths in
          general on the same easy principle of metaphors misunderstood.
          Primitive man, on Plutarch's theory, firmly believed that the
          fruits of the earth on which he subsisted were not themselves gods
          but merely the gifts of the gods, who were the real givers of all
          good things. Yet at the same time men were in the habit of
          bestowing on these divine products the names of their divine
          creators, either out of gratitude or merely for the sake of
          brevity, as when we say that a man has bought a Shakespeare or
          acted Molière, when we mean that he has bought the works of
          Shakespeare or acted the plays of Molière. This abbreviated mode of
          expression was misunderstood in later times, and so  span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043] a name="Pg043" id="Pg043"
          class="tei tei-anchor"> people came to look upon the fruits of
          the earth as themselves divine instead of as being the work of
          divinities: in short, they mistook the creature for the creator. In
          like manner Plutarch would explain the Egyptian worship of animals
          as reverence done not so much to the beasts themselves as to the
          great god who displays the divine handiwork in sentient organisms
          even more than in the most beautiful and wonderful works of
          inanimate nature. a id="noteref_84" name="noteref_84" href=

              His theory is an inversion of the
              truth: for fetishism is the antecedent, not the corruption, of
              theism. Lamentations of the savage for the animals and plants
              which he kills and eats.
            
          

          The comparative
          study of religion has proved that these theories of Plutarch are an
          inversion of the truth. Fetishism, or the view that the fruits of
          the earth and things in general are divine or animated by powerful
          spirits, is not, as Plutarch imagined, a late corruption of a pure
          and primitive theism, which regarded the gods as the creators and
          givers of all good things. On the contrary, fetishism is early and
          theism is late in the history of mankind. In this respect
          Xenophanes, whom Plutarch attempts to correct, displayed a much
          truer insight into the mind of the savage. To weep crocodile tears
          over the animals and plants which he kills and eats, and to pray
          them to come again in order that they may be again eaten and again
          lamented—this may seem absurd to us, but it is precisely what the
          savage does. And from his point of view the proceeding is not at
          all absurd but perfectly rational and well calculated to answer his
          ends. For he sincerely believes that animals and fruits are
          tenanted by spirits who can harm him if they please, and who cannot
          but be put to considerable inconvenience by that destruction of
          their bodies which is unfortunately inseparable from the processes
          of mastication and digestion. What more natural, therefore, than
          that the savage should offer excuses to the beasts and the fruits
          for the painful necessity he is under of consuming them, and that
          he should endeavour to alleviate their pangs by soft words and an
          air of respectful sympathy, in order that they may bear him no
          grudge, and may in due time come again to be again eaten and again
          lamented? Judged by the standard of primitive manners the attitude
          of the walrus to the oysters was strictly correct:— span class=

          Many examples of
          such hypocritical lamentations for animals, drawn not from the

          shall quote the general statement of a writer on the Indians of
          British Columbia, because it covers the case of vegetable as well
          as of animal food. After describing the respectful welcome accorded
          by the Stlatlum Indians to the first  span class=

          season, he goes on: “The significance of
          these ceremonies is easy to perceive when we remember the attitude
          of the Indians towards nature generally, and recall their myths
          relating to the salmon, and their coming to their rivers and
          streams. Nothing that the Indian of this region eats is regarded by
          him as mere food and nothing more. Not a single plant, animal, or
          fish, or other object upon which he feeds, is looked upon in this
          light, or as something he has secured for himself by his own wit
          and skill. He regards it rather as something which has been
          voluntarily and compassionately placed in his hands by the goodwill
          and consent of the 'spirit' of the object itself, or by the
          intercession and magic of his culture-heroes; to be retained and
          used by him only upon the fulfilment of certain conditions. These
          conditions include respect and reverent care in the killing or
          plucking of the animal or plant and proper treatment of the parts
          he has no use for, such as the bones, blood, and offal; and the
          depositing of the same in some stream or lake, so that the object
          may by that means renew its life and physical form. The practices
          in connection with the killing of animals and the gathering of
          plants and fruits all make this quite clear, and it is only when we
          bear this attitude of the savage towards nature in mind that we can
          hope to rightly understand the motives and purposes of many of his
          strange customs and beliefs.” a id="noteref_86" name=

              Thus the lamentations of the sower
              become intelligible.
            
          

          We can now
          understand why among many peoples of antiquity, as Plutarch tells
          us, the time of sowing was a time of sorrow. The laying of the seed
          in the earth was a burial of the divine element, and it was fitting
          that like a human burial it should be performed with gravity and
          the semblance, if not the reality, of sorrow. Yet they sorrowed not
          without hope, perhaps a sure and certain hope, that the seed which
          they thus committed with sighs and tears to the ground would yet
          rise from the dust and yield fruit a hundredfold to the reaper.
          “They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
          He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall
          doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with
          him.” a id="noteref_87" name="noteref_87" href=

          § 4. Rites of Harvest.

          

          
            
              Lamentations of the Egyptian
              corn-reapers.
            
          

          The Egyptian
          harvest, as we have seen, falls not in autumn but in spring, in the
          months of March, April, and May. To the husbandman the time of
          harvest, at least in a good year, must necessarily be a season of
          joy: in bringing home his sheaves he is requited for his long and
          anxious labours. Yet if the old Egyptian farmer felt a secret joy
          at reaping and garnering the grain, it was essential that he should
          conceal the natural emotion under an air of profound dejection. For
          was he not severing the body of the corn-god with his sickle and
          trampling it to pieces under the hoofs of his cattle on the
          threshing-floor? a id="noteref_88" name="noteref_88" href=
          "#note_88"> span style=

          Accordingly we are told that it was an ancient custom of the
          Egyptian corn-reapers to beat their breasts and lament over the
          first sheaf cut, while at the same time they called upon
          Isis. a id="noteref_89" name="noteref_89" href=

          invocation seems to have taken the form of a melancholy chant, to
          which the Greeks gave the name of Maneros. Similar plaintive
          strains were chanted by corn-reapers in  span class="tei tei-pb"

          Probably all these doleful ditties were lamentations for the
          corn-god killed by the sickles of the reapers. In Egypt the slain
          deity was Osiris, and the name  span class=
          "tei tei-hi">Maneros
          applied to the dirge appears to be derived from certain words
          meaning “Come to thy house,” which
          often occur in the lamentations for the dead god. a id="noteref_91"

          Ceremonies of
          the same sort have been observed by other peoples, probably for the
          same purpose. Thus we are told that among all vegetables corn
          ( span style=
          "font-style: italic">selu), by which is apparently
          meant maize, holds the first place in the household economy and the
          ceremonial observance of the Cherokee Indians, who invoke it under
          the name of “the Old Woman” in
          allusion to a myth that it sprang from the blood of an old woman
          killed by her disobedient sons. “Much
          ceremony accompanied the planting and tending of the crop. Seven
          grains, the sacred number, were put into each hill, and these were
          not afterwards thinned out. After the last working of the crop, the
          priest and an assistant—generally the owner of the field—went into
          the field and built a small enclosure in the centre. Then entering
          it, they seated themselves upon the ground, with heads bent down,
          and while the assistant kept perfect silence the priest, with
          rattle in hand, sang songs of invocation to the spirit of the corn.
          Soon, according to the orthodox belief, a loud rustling would be
          heard outside, which they would know was caused by the  span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘Old Woman’ bringing the corn into the field,
          but neither must look up until the song was finished. This ceremony
          was repeated on four successive nights, after which no one entered
          the field for seven other nights, when the priest himself went in,
          and, if all the sacred regulations had been properly observed, was
          rewarded by finding young ears upon the stalks. The corn ceremonies
          could be performed by the owner of the field himself, provided he
          was willing to pay a sufficient fee to the priest in order to learn
          the songs and ritual. Care was always taken to keep a  span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"> clean trail from the field to the
          house, so that the corn might be encouraged to stay at home and not
          go wandering elsewhere. Most of these customs have now fallen into
          disuse excepting among the old people, by many of whom they are
          still religiously observed. Another curious ceremony, of which even
          the memory is now almost forgotten, was enacted after the first
          working of the corn, when the owner or priest stood in succession
          at each of the four corners of the field and wept and wailed
          loudly. Even the priests are now unable to give a reason for this
          performance, which may have been a lament for the bloody death of
          Selu,” the Old Woman of the Corn. a id="noteref_92" name=

          probably in one of her aspects an Old Woman of the Corn. Further,

          leaves two branches and a top-knot, resembling a man's head and
          outstretched arms. Having descended from the tree, he binds the

          The conception
          of the corn-spirit as old and dead at harvest is very clearly
          embodied in a custom observed by the Arabs of Moab. When the
          harvesters have nearly finished their task and only a small corner
          of the field remains to be reaped, the owner takes a handful of
          wheat tied up in a sheaf. A hole is dug in the form of a grave, and
          two stones are set upright, one at the head and the other at the
          foot, just as in an ordinary burial. Then the sheaf of wheat is
          laid at the bottom of the grave, and the sheikh pronounces these
          words, “The old man is dead.” Earth
          is afterwards thrown in to cover the sheaf, with a prayer,

              the Egyptian festivals ceased to
              rotate through the natural year.
            
          

          Such, then, were
          the principal events of the farmer's calendar in ancient Egypt, and
          such the simple religious rites by which he celebrated them. But we
          have still to consider the Osirian festivals of the official
          calendar, so far as these are described by Greek writers or
          recorded on the monuments. In examining them it is necessary to
          bear in mind that on account of the movable year of the old
          Egyptian calendar the true or astronomical dates of the official
          festivals must have varied from year to year, at least until the
          adoption of the fixed Alexandrian year in 30  span class=

          onward, apparently, the dates of the festivals were determined by
          the new calendar, and so ceased to rotate throughout the length of
          the solar year. At all events Plutarch, writing about the end of
          the first century, implies that they were then fixed, not movable;
          for though he does not mention the Alexandrian calendar, he clearly
          dates the festivals by it. a id="noteref_97" name="noteref_97"

              Feast of All Souls.

          us that the grave of Osiris was at Sais in Lower Egypt, and that

          The Esquimaux of
          St. Michael and the lower Yukon River in Alaska hold a festival of
          the dead every year at the end of November or the beginning of
          December, as well as a greater festival at intervals of several
          years. At these seasons, food, drink, and clothes are provided for
          the returning ghosts in the  span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"> span style=
          "font-style: italic">kashim or clubhouse of the
          village, which is illuminated with oil lamps. Every man or woman
          who wishes to honour a dead friend sets up a lamp on a stand in
          front of the place which the deceased used to occupy in the
          clubhouse. These lamps, filled with seal oil, are kept burning day
          and night till the festival is over. They are believed to light the
          shades on their return to [pg
          052]
          their old home and back again to the land of the dead. If any one
          fails to put up a lamp in the clubhouse and to keep it burning, the
          shade whom he or she desires to honour could not find its way to
          the place and so would miss the feast. On the eve of the festival
          the nearest male relation goes to the grave and summons the ghost
          by planting there a small model of a seal spear or of a wooden
          dish, according as the deceased was a man or a woman. The badges of
          the dead are marked on these implements. When all is ready, the
          ghosts gather in the fire-pit under the clubhouse, and ascending
          through the floor at the proper moment take possession of the
          bodies of their namesakes, to whom the offerings of food, drink,
          and clothing are made for the benefit of the dead. Thus each shade
          obtains the supplies he needs in the other world. The dead who have
          none to make offerings to them are believed to suffer great
          destitution. Hence the Esquimaux fear to die without leaving behind
          them some one who will sacrifice to their spirits, and childless
          people generally adopt children lest their shades should be
          forgotten at the festivals. When a person has been much disliked,
          his ghost is sometimes purposely ignored, and that is deemed the
          severest punishment that could be inflicted upon him. After the
          songs of invitation to the dead have been sung, the givers of the
          feast take a small portion of food from every dish and cast it down
          as an offering to the shades; then each pours a little water on the
          floor so that it runs through the cracks. In this way they believe
          that the spiritual essence of all the food and water is conveyed to
          the souls. The remainder of the food is afterwards distributed
          among the people present, who eat of it heartily. Then with songs
          and dances the feast comes to an end, and the ghosts are dismissed
          to their own place. Dances form a conspicuous feature of the great
          festival of the dead, which is held every few years. The dancers
          dance not only in the clubhouse but also at the graves and on the
          ice, if the deceased met their death by drowning. a id=

          the forest by night with burning torches in their hands. After a
          time they presented themselves to the relations of the deceased,

          The Miztecs of
          Mexico believed that the souls of the dead came back in the twelfth
          month of every year, which corresponded to our November. On this
          day of All Souls the houses were decked out to welcome the spirits.
          Jars of food and drink were set on a table in the principal room,
          and the family went forth with torches to meet the ghosts and
          invite them to enter. Then returning themselves to the house they
          knelt around the table, and with eyes bent on the ground prayed the
          souls to accept of the offerings and to procure the blessings of
          the gods upon the family. Thus they remained on bended knees and
          with downcast eyes till the morning, not daring to look at the
          table lest they [pg
          055]
          should offend the spirits by spying on them at their meal. With the
          first beams of the sun they rose, glad at heart. The jars of food
          which had been presented to the dead were given to the poor or
          deposited in a secret place. a id="noteref_112" name="noteref_112"

          Again, the
          natives of Sumba, an East Indian island, celebrate a New Year's
          festival, which is at the same time a festival of the dead. The
          graves are in the middle of the village, and at a given moment all
          the people repair to them and raise a loud weeping and wailing.
          Then after indulging for a short time in the national pastimes they
          disperse to their houses, and every family calls upon its dead to
          come back. The ghosts are believed to hear and accept the
          invitation. Accordingly betel and areca nuts are set out for them.
          Victims, too, are sacrificed in front of every house, and their
          hearts and livers are offered with rice to the dead. After a decent
          interval these portions are distributed amongst the living, who
          consume them and banquet gaily on flesh and rice, a rare event in
          their frugal lives. Then they play, dance, and sing to their
          heart's content, and the festival which began so lugubriously ends
          by being the merriest of the year. A little before daybreak the
          invisible guests take their departure. All the people turn out of
          their houses to escort them a little way. Holding in one hand the
          half of a coco-nut, which contains a small packet of provisions for
          the dead, and in the other hand a piece of smouldering wood, they
          march in procession, singing a drawling song to the accompaniment
          of a gong and waving the lighted brands in time to the music. So
          they move through the darkness till with the last words of the song

          In Kiriwina, one
          of the Trobriand Islands, to the east of New Guinea, the spirits of
          the ancestors are believed to revisit their native village in a
          body once a year after the harvest has been got in. At this time
          the men perform special dances, the people openly display their
          valuables, spread out on platforms, and great feasts are made for
          the spirits. On a certain night, when the moon is at the full, all
          the people raise a great shout and so drive away the spirits to the
          spirit land. a id="noteref_115" name="noteref_115" href=

          Sea Dyaks of Borneo celebrate a great festival in honour of the
          dead at irregular intervals, it may be one or more years after the
          death of a particular person. All who have died since the last
          feast was held, and have not yet been honoured by such a
          celebration, are remembered at this time; hence the number of
          persons commemorated may be great, especially if many years have
          elapsed since the last commemoration service. The preparations last
          many weeks: food and drink and all other necessaries are stored in
          plenty, and the whole neighbourhood for miles round is invited to
          attend. On the eve of the feast the women take bamboo splints and
          fashion out of them little models of various useful articles, and
          these models are hung over the graves for the use of the dead in
          the other world. If the feast is held in honour of a man, the
          things manufactured in his behoof will take the form of a bamboo
          gun, a shield, a war-cap, and so on; if it is a woman who is
          commemorated, little models of a loom, a fish-basket, a
          winnowing-fan and such like things will be provided for her spirit;
          and if it is a child for whom the rite is performed, toys of
          various kinds will be made ready for the childish ghost. Finally,
          to stay the appetite of ghosts who may be too sharp-set to wait for
          the formal banquet in the house,  span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page057">[pg 057] a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"> a supply of victuals is very considerately
          placed outside the house on which the hungry spirits may fall to
          without delay. The dead arrive in a boat from the other world; for
          living Dyaks generally travel by river, from which it necessarily
          follows that Dyak ghosts do so likewise. The ship in which the
          ghostly visitors voyage to the land of the living is not much to
          look at, being in appearance nothing but a tiny boat made out of a
          bamboo which has been used to cook rice. Even this is not set
          floating on the river but is simply thrown away under the house.
          Yet through the incantations uttered by the professional
          wailing-woman the bark is wafted away to the spirit world and is
          there converted into a large war-canoe. Gladly the ghosts embark
          and sail away as soon as the final summons comes. It always comes
          in the evening, for it is then that the wailer begins to croon her
          mournful ditties; but the way is so long that the spirits do not
          arrive in the house till the day is breaking. To refresh them after
          their weary journey a bamboo full of rice-spirit awaits them; and
          this they partake of by deputy, for a brave old man, who does not
          fear the face of ghosts, quaffs the beverage in their stead amid
          the joyful shouts of the spectators. On the morning after the feast
          the living pay the last offices of respect to the dead. Monuments
          made of ironwood, the little bamboo articles, and food of all kinds
          are set upon the graves. In consideration of these gifts the ghosts
          now relinquish all claims on their surviving relatives, and
          henceforth earn their own living by the sweat of their brow. Before
          they take their final departure they come to eat and drink in the
          house for the last time. a id="noteref_116" name="noteref_116"

          class="tei tei-anchor"> Nagas of Manipur, in Assam, celebrate
          every year about the end of January. At this great feast the dead
          are represented by living men, chosen on the ground of their
          likeness to the departed, who are decked with ornaments and treated
          as if they were in truth the deceased persons come to life again.
          In that character they dance together in the large open space of
          the village, they are fed by the female relations, and they go from
          house to house, receiving presents of cloth. The festival lasts ten
          days, but the great day is the ninth. Huge torches of pinewood are
          made ready to be used that evening when darkness has fallen. The
          time of departure of the dead is at hand. Their living
          representatives are treated to a last meal in the houses, and they
          distribute farewell presents to the sorrowing kinsfolk, who have
          come to bid them good-bye. When the sun has set, a procession is
          formed. At the head of it march men holding aloft the flaring,
          sputtering torches. Then follow the elders armed and in martial
          array, and behind them stalk the representatives of the dead, with
          the relations of the departed crowding and trooping about them.
          Slowly and mournfully the sad procession moves, with loud
          lamentations, through the darkness to a spot at the north end of
          the village which is overshadowed by a great tree. The light of the
          torches is to guide the souls of the dead to their place of rest;
          the warlike array of the elders is to guard them from the perils
          and dangers of the way. At the village boundary the procession
          stops and the torch-bearers throw down their torches. At the same
          moment the spirits of the dead are believed to pass into the dying
          flambeaux and in that guise to depart to the far country. There is
          therefore no further need for their living representatives, who are
          accordingly stripped of all their finery on the spot. When the
          people return home, each family is careful to light a pine torch
          and set it burning on a stone in the house just inside the front
          door; this they do as a precaution to prevent their own souls from
          following the spirits of the dead to the other world. The expense
          of thus despatching the dead to their long home is very great; when
          the head of a family dies, debts may be incurred and rice-fields
          and houses sold to defray the cost of carriage. Thus  span class=

              Annual festival of the dead among
              the Oraons of Bengal.
            
          

          The Oraons or
          Uraons of Bengal feast their dead every year on a day in January.
          This ceremony is called the Great Marriage, because by it the bones
          of the deceased are believed to be mysteriously reunited to each
          other. The Oraons treat the bones of the dead differently according
          to the dates of their death in the agricultural year. The bones of
          those who died before the seeds have sprouted in the fields are
          burnt, and the few charred bones which have not been reduced to
          ashes are gathered in an earthen pot. With the bones in the pot are
          placed offerings of rice, native gin, and money, and then they
          carry the urn to the river, where the bones of their forefathers
          repose. But the bones of all who die after the seeds have sprung up
          and before the end of harvest may not be taken to the river,
          because the people believe that were that to be done the crops
          would suffer. These bones are therefore put away in a pot under a
          stone near the house till the harvest is over. Then on the
          appointed day in January they are all collected. A banquet is given
          in honour of the dead, and then both men and women form a
          procession to accompany the bones to their last resting-place in
          the sands of the river. But first the relics of mortality are
          carried from house to house in the village, and each family pours
          rice and gin into the urn which contains the bones of its dead.
          Then the procession sets out for the river, men and women dancing,
          singing, beating drums, and weeping, while the earthen pots
          containing the bones are passed from hand to hand and dance with
          the jigging steps of the dancers. When they are yet some way from
          the spot, the bearers of the urns run forward and bury them in the
          sand of the river. When the rest come up, they all bathe and the
          Great Marriage is over. a id="noteref_118" name="noteref_118" href=

          Manes— span style=

          It is believed that during this fortnight it is the practice of all
          the departed to come and visit their relatives. The homes are
          therefore cleaned, and the spaces in front of the house are
          plastered and painted in order to be pleasing to those who are
          expected. It is believed that the departed will return on the very
          date on which they went away. A father who left on the fourth, be
          it the fourth of the dark half or the light half of the moon, will
          return to visit his family on the fourth of the Fortnight of the
          Manes. On that day cakes are prepared, and with certain ceremony
          these are offered to the unseen hovering spirit. Their implicit
          belief is that the spirit will partake of the essence of the food,
          and that which remains—the material portion—may be eaten by members
          of the family. The souls of women, it is said, will all come on the
          ninth of the fortnight. On the thirteenth come those who have met
          with a violent death and who lost their lives by a fall, by
          snake-bite, or any other unusual cause. During the Fortnight of the
          Manes a woman is not supposed to put on new bangles and a man is
          not permitted to shave. In short, this is a season of sad
          remembrances, an annual festival for the departed.” a id=

          The Bghais, a
          Karen tribe of Burma, hold an annual feast for the dead at the new
          moon which falls near the end of August or the beginning of
          September. All the villagers who have lost relatives within the
          last three years take part in it. Food and drink are set out on
          tables for the ghosts, and new clothes for them are hung up in the
          room. All being ready, the people beat gongs and begin to weep.
          Each one calls upon the relation whom he has lost to come and eat.
          When the dead are thought to have arrived, the  span class=

          accompany you, all your friends and associates, and the long dead.
          Call them all to eat and drink.” The ghosts having finished
          their repast, the people dry their tears and sit down to eat what
          is left. More food is then prepared and put into a basket, and at
          cock-crow next morning the contents of the basket are thrown out of
          the house, while the living weep and call upon their dead as

          the dead.” When a person dies and has been burnt, the ashes
          are collected and placed in a small house in the forest together
          with his spear or gun, which has first been broken. These little
          huts are generally arranged in groups near a village, and are
          sometimes large enough to be mistaken for one. After harvest all
          the relations of the deceased cook various kinds of food and take
          them with pots of liquor distilled from rice to the village of the
          dead. There they open the doors of the houses, and having placed

              Annual festival of the dead in
              Cambodia.
            
          

          The great
          festival of the dead in Cambodia takes place on the last day of the
          month Phatrabot (September-October), but ever since the moon began
          to wane everybody has been busy preparing for it. In every house
          cakes and sweetmeats are set out, candles burn, incense sticks
          smoke, and the whole is offered to the ancestral shades with an
          invocation which is thrice repeated: “O all
          you our ancestors who are departed, deign to come and eat what we
          have prepared [pg
          062]
          for you, and to bless your posterity and make it happy.”
          Fifteen days afterwards many little boats are made of bark and
          filled with rice, cakes, small coins, smoking incense sticks, and
          lighted candles. At evening these are set floating on the river,
          and the souls of the dead embark in them to return to their own
          place. The living now bid them farewell.  span class=

          you will return, you will return.” The river is now covered
          with twinkling points of fire. But the current soon bears them
          away, and as they vanish one by one in the darkness the souls
          depart with them to the far country. a id="noteref_122" name=

          bow before the unseen visitors and beseech them to remember and

              Annual festival of the dead in

          In Annam one of
          the most important festivals of the year is the festival of Têt,
          which falls on the first three days of the New Year. It is devoted
          to the worship of ancestors. Everybody, even the poorest, must
          provide a good meal for the souls of his dead at this time and must
          himself eat and [pg
          063]
          drink heartily. Some families, in order to discharge this pious
          duty, run into debt for the whole year. In the houses everything is
          put in order, washed, and scoured for the reception of the dear and
          distinguished guests. A tall bamboo pole is set up in the front of
          every house and allowed to stand there for seven days. A small
          basket containing areca, betel, and leaves of gilt paper is
          fastened to the pole. The erection of the pole is a sacred rite
          which no family omits to perform, though why they do so few people
          can say. Some, however, allege that the posts are intended to guide
          the ancestral spirits to their old homes. The ceremony of the
          reception of the shades takes place at nightfall on the last day of
          the year. The house of the head of the family is then decked with
          flowers, and in the room which serves as a domestic chapel the
          altar of the ancestors is surrounded with flowers, among which the
          lotus, the emblem of immortality, is most conspicuous. On a table
          are set red candles, perfumes, incense, sandal-wood, and plates
          full of bananas, oranges, and other fruits. The relations crouch
          before the altar, and kneeling at the foot of it the head of the
          house invokes the name of the family which he represents. Then in
          solemn tones he recites an incantation, mentioning the names of his
          most illustrious ancestors and marking time with the strokes of a
          hammer upon a gong, while crackers are exploded outside the room.
          After that, he implores the ancestral shades to protect their
          descendants and invites them to a repast, which is spread for them
          on a table. Round this table he walks, serving the invisible guests
          with his own hands. He distributes to them smoking balls of rice in
          little china saucers, and pours tea or spirits into each little
          cup, while he murmurs words of invitation and compliment. When the
          ghosts have eaten and drunk their fill, the head of the family
          returns to the altar and salutes them for the last time. Finally,
          he takes leaves of yellow paper, covered with gold and silver
          spangles, and throws them into a brazier placed at the foot of the
          ancestral tablets. These papers represent imaginary bars of gold
          and silver which the living send to the dead. Cardboard models of
          houses, furniture, jewels, clothes, of everything in short that the
          [pg 064] a name=

          the other world, are despatched to them in like manner in the
          flames. Then the family sits down to table and feasts on the

              Annual festival of friendless
              ghosts in Annam.
            
          

          But in Annam it
          is not merely the spirits of ancestors who are thus feasted and
          supplied with all the necessaries of life. The poor ghosts of those
          who died without leaving descendants or whose bodies were left
          unburied are not forgotten by the pious Annamites. But these
          spirits come round at a different time of year from the others. The
          seventh month of the year is set apart for expiatory sacrifices
          destined to benefit these unhappy beings, and that is why in Annam
          nobody should marry or be betrothed in that month. The great day of
          the month is the fifteenth, which is called the Festival of the
          Souls. On that day the ghosts in question are set free by the lord
          of the underworld, and they come prowling about among the living.
          They are exceedingly dangerous, especially to children. Hence in
          order to appease their wrath and prevent them from entering the
          houses every family takes care to put out offerings for them in the
          street. Before every house on that night you may see candles
          lighted, paper garments of many colours, paper hats, paper boots,
          paper furniture, ingots of gold and silver paper, all hanging in
          tempting array from a string, while plates of food and cups of tea
          and rice-spirit stand ready for the use of hungry and thirsty
          souls. The theory is that the ghosts will be so busy consuming the
          victuals, appropriating the deceitful riches, and trying on the
          paper coats, hats, and boots that they will have neither the
          leisure nor the inclination to intrude upon the domestic circle
          indoors. At seven o'clock in the evening fire is put to the
          offerings, and the paper wardrobe, furniture, and money soon vanish
          crackling in the flames. At the same moment, peeping in at a door
          or window, you may see the domestic ancestral altar brilliantly
          illuminated. As for the food, it is supposed to be thrown on the
          fire or on the ground for the  span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          In Cochinchina
          the ancestral spirits are similarly propitiated and fed on the
          first day of the New Year. The tablets which represent them are
          placed on the domestic altar, and the family prostrate themselves
          before these emblems of the departed. The head of the family lights
          sticks of incense on the altar and prays the shades of his
          forefathers to accept the offerings and be favourable to their
          descendants. With great gravity he waits upon the ghosts, passing
          dishes of food before the ancestral tablets and pouring out wine
          and tea to slake the thirst of the spirits. When the dead are
          supposed to be satisfied with the shadowy essence of the food, the
          living partake of its gross material substance. a id="noteref_126"

          Early in April
          every year the Dahomans of West Africa “set
          a table, as they term it, and invite friends to eat with the
          deceased relatives, whose spirits are supposed to move round and
          partake of the good things of this life. Even my interpreter,
          Madi-Ki Lemon, who pretends to despise the belief in fetish, sets a
          table to his ancestors, and will tell you that his grand- or
          great-grandfather, Corporal Lemon, makes a meal on this occasion

          every year a festival in the month of November. It is a festival of
          thanksgiving for the completion of the harvest, and at the same
          time a commemoration and propitiation of the dead. Every house
          prepares much beer for the occasion, and a small pot of beer is set
          out for each deceased member of the household. After standing for
          two days in the house the beer which was devoted to the dead is
          drunk by the living. At these festivals all the people of a
          district meet in a special place, and there pass the time in games
          and dances. Among the Barea the festive gatherings are held in a
          sacred grove. We are told that “he who owes
          another a drubbing on this day can pay his debt with impunity; for

          Among peoples of
          the Aryan stock, so far back as we can trace their history, the
          worship and propitiation of the dead seem to have formed a
          principal element of the popular religion; a id="noteref_133" name=

          like so many other races they appear to have believed that once a
          year the souls of their departed kinsfolk revisited their old homes
          and expected to be refreshed with abundance of good cheer by their
          surviving relations. This belief gave rise to the custom of
          celebrating an annual Feast of All Souls, which has come down to us
          from a dateless antiquity and is still observed year by year, with
          rites of primitive simplicity, in some parts of Europe. Such a
          festival was held every year in spring by the old Iranians. The
          celebration fell at the end of the year and lasted ten days, namely
          the last five days of the last month and the five following
          supplementary days, which were regularly inserted to make up a year
          of three hundred and sixty-five days; for the old Iranian, like the
          old Egyptian, year was a vague year of twelve months of thirty days
          each, with five supplementary days added at the end for the sake of
          bringing it into apparent, though not real, harmony with the sun's
          annual course in the sky. According to one calculation the ten days
          of the festival corresponded to the last days of February, but
          according to another they fell in March; in later ages the Parsees
          assigned them to the time of the spring equinox. The name of the

          the last five days of the month Aban were called Farwardajan.
          “During this time,” he says,
          “people put food in the halls of the dead
          and drink on the roofs of the houses, believing that the spirits of
          their dead during these days come out from the places of their
          reward or their punishment, that they go to the dishes laid out for
          them, imbibe their strength and suck their taste. They fumigate
          their houses with juniper, that the dead may enjoy its smell. The
          spirits of the pious men dwell among their families, children, and
          relations, and occupy themselves with their affairs, although
          invisible to them.” He adds that there was a controversy
          among the Persians as to the date of this festival of the dead,
          some maintaining that the five days during which it lasted were the
          last five days of the month Aban, whereas others held that they
          were the five supplementary days which were inserted between the
          months Aban and Adhar. The dispute, he continues, was settled by
          the adoption of all ten days for the celebration of the

          Similar beliefs
          as to the annual return of the dead survive to this day in many
          parts of Europe and find expression in similar customs. The day of
          the dead or of All Souls, as we call it, is commonly the second of
          November. Thus in Lower Brittany the souls of the departed come to
          visit the living on the eve of that day. After vespers are over,
          the priests and choir walk in procession,  span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the procession of the charnel-house,” chanting
          a weird dirge in the Breton tongue. Then the people go home, gather
          round the fire, and talk of the departed. The housewife covers the
          kitchen table with a white cloth, sets out cider, curds, and hot
          pancakes on it, and retires with the family to rest. The fire on
          the hearth is kept up by a huge log known as  span class=

          waking the sleepers by a wild and melancholy song, in which they
          remind the living in their comfortable beds to pray for the poor
          souls in pain. All that night the dead warm themselves at the
          hearth and feast on the viands prepared for them. Sometimes the
          awe-struck listeners hear the stools creaking in the kitchen, or
          the dead leaves outside rustling under the ghostly footsteps. a id=

          the Vosges Mountains on All Souls' Eve the solemn sound of the

          to uncover the beds and open the windows, doubtless in order to let
          the poor souls enter and rest. No one that evening would dare to
          remain deaf to the appeal of the bells. The prayers are prolonged
          to a late hour of the night. When the last  span lang="la" class=

          In Bruges,

          the houses on the Eve of All Souls, and the bells toll till
          midnight, or even till morning. People, too, often set lighted
          candles on the graves. At Scherpenheuvel the houses are
          illuminated, and the people walk in procession carrying lighted
          candles in their hands. A very common custom in Belgium is to eat
          “soul-cakes” or  span class=

          The eating of them is believed to benefit the dead in some way.

          ghosts were thought to enter into the bodies of their relatives and
          so to share the victuals which the survivors consumed. Similarly at
          festivals in honour of the dead in Northern India it is customary
          to feed Brahmans, and the food which these holy men partake of is

          Purgatory for every cake you eat. At Antwerp they give a local
          colour to the soul-cakes by baking them with plenty of saffron, the
          deep yellow tinge being suggestive of the flames of Purgatory.

          district of Southern Bavaria which extends along the valley of the
          Lech from its source to near the point where the river flows into
          the Danube, the two festivals of All Saints and All Souls, on the
          first [pg 071] a name=
          "Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"> and second of
          November, have significantly fused in popular usage into a single
          festival of the dead. In fact, the people pay little or no heed to
          the saints and give all their thoughts to the souls of their
          departed kinsfolk. The Feast of All Souls begins immediately after
          vespers on All Saints' Day. Even on the eve of All Saints' Day,
          that is, on the thirty-first of October, which we call Hallowe'en,
          the graveyard is cleaned and every grave adorned. The decoration
          consists in weeding the mounds, sprinkling a layer of charcoal on
          the bare earth, and marking out patterns on it in red
          service-berries. The marigold, too, is still in bloom at that
          season in cottage gardens, and garlands of its orange blooms,
          mingled with other late flowers left by the departing summer, are
          twined about the grey mossgrown tombstones. The basin of holy water
          is filled with fresh water and a branch of box-wood put into it;
          for box-wood in the popular mind is associated with death and the
          dead. On the eve of All Souls' Day the people begin to visit the
          graves and to offer the soul-cakes to the hungry souls. Next
          morning, before eight o'clock, commence the vigil, the requiem, and
          the solemn visitation of the graves. On that day every household
          offers a plate of meal, oats, and spelt on a side-altar in the
          church; while in the middle of the sacred edifice a bier is set,
          covered with a pall, and surrounded by lighted tapers and vessels
          of holy water. The tapers burnt on that day and indeed generally in
          services for the departed are red. In the evening people go,
          whenever they can do so, to their native village, where their dear
          ones lie in the churchyard; and there at the graves they pray for
          the poor souls, and leave an offering of soul-cakes also on a
          side-altar in the church. The soul-cakes are baked of dough in the
          shape of a coil of hair and are made of all sizes up to three feet
          long. They form a perquisite of the sexton. a id="noteref_143"

          bended knees for their repose. On the graves, too, lights are
          kindled, vessels of holy water placed, and food deposited for the
          refreshment of the souls. All over the Upper Palatinate on All
          Souls' Day it is also customary to bake special cakes of fine bread
          and distribute them to the poor, a id="noteref_145" name=

              Feast of All Souls in
              Bohemia.
            
          

          The Germans of
          Bohemia observe All Souls' Day with much solemnity. Each family
          celebrates the memory of its dead. On the eve of the day it is
          customary to eat cakes and to drink cold milk for the purpose of
          cooling the poor souls who are roasting in purgatory; from which it
          appears that spirits feel the soothing effect of victuals consumed
          vicariously by their friends on earth. The ringing of the church
          bells to prayer on that evening is believed to be the signal at
          which the ghosts, released from the infernal gaol, come trooping to
          the old familiar fire-side, there to rest from their pangs for a
          single night. So in many places people fill a lamp with butter,
          light it, and set it on the hearth, that with the butter the poor
          ghosts may anoint the burns they have received from the sulphureous
          and tormenting flames of purgatory. Next morning the chime of the
          church bells, ringing to early mass, is the knell that bids the
          souls return to their place of pain; but such as have completed
          their penance take flight to heaven. So on the eve of All Saints'
          Day each family gathers in the parlour or the kitchen, speaks
          softly of those they have lost, recalls what they said and did in
          life, and prays for the repose of their souls. While the prayer is
          being said, the children kindle little wax lights which have been
          specially bought for the purpose that day. Next morning the
          families go to church, where mass is celebrated for the dead; then
          they wend their way to the  span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          their kinsfolk with flowers and wreaths and set little lights upon
          them. This custom of illumining the graves and decking them with
          flowers on the Eve or Day of All Souls is common all over Bohemia;
          it is observed in Prague as well as in the country, by Czechs as
          well as by Germans. In some Czech villages four-cornered cakes of a
          special sort, baked of white wheaten meal with milk, are eaten on
          All Souls' Day or given to beggars that they may pray for the
          dead. a id="noteref_146" name="noteref_146" href=

          All Souls' Day
          is celebrated with similar rites by the Germans of Moravia.
          “The festival of the farewell to

          the memory of the departed souls, and this last has survived in the
          Feast of All Souls, which is everywhere observed with great piety.
          On the evening of All Souls the relations of the departed assemble
          in the churchyards and adorn the graves of their dear ones with

          or butter are lighted and placed on the hearth on All Souls' Eve in

          smear the melted grease on their burns and so alleviate their
          pangs. [pg

          Some people also leave milk and dough-nuts for them on the table
          all night. The graves also are illuminated with wax candles and
          decked with such a profusion of flowers that you might think it was

          The Letts used
          to entertain and feed the souls of the dead for four weeks from
          Michaelmas (September 29) to the day of St. Simon and St. Jude
          (October 28). They called the season  span class=

          holy that while it lasted they would not willingly thresh the corn,
          alleging that grain threshed at that time would be useless for
          sowing, since the souls of the dead would not allow it to sprout.
          But we may suspect that the original motive of the abstinence was a
          fear lest the blows of the flails should fall upon the poor ghosts
          swarming in the air. At this season the people were wont to prepare
          food of all sorts for the spirits and set it on the floor of a
          room, which had been well heated and swept for the purpose. Late in
          the evening the master of the house went into the room, tended the
          fire, and called upon his dead kinsfolk by their names to come and
          eat and drink. If he saw the ghosts, he would die within the year;
          but if [pg

          he did not see them he would outlive it. When he thought the souls
          had eaten and drunk enough, he took the staff which served as a
          poker and laying it on the threshold cut it in two with an axe. At
          the same time he bade the spirits go their way, charging them to
          keep to the roads and paths and not to tread upon the rye. If the
          crops turned out ill next year, the people laid the failure at the
          door of the ghosts, who fancied themselves scurvily treated and had
          taken their revenge by trampling down the corn. a id="noteref_152"

          seat and a napkin for every soul who had been invited. They left
          the souls to revel by themselves for three days in the hut; then
          they deposited the remains of the banquet on the graves and bade

          In some parts of
          the Russian Government of Olonets the inhabitants of a village
          sometimes celebrate a joint festival in honour of all their dead.
          Having chosen a house for the purpose, they spread three tables,
          one outside the front door, one in the passage, and one in the room
          which is heated by a stove. Then they go out to meet their
          [pg 076] a name=
          "Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"> unseen guests and
          usher them into the house with these words,  span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ye are tired, our own ones; take something to
          eat.” The ghosts accordingly refresh themselves at each
          table in succession. Then the master of the house bids them warm
          themselves at the stove, remarking that they must have grown cold
          in the damp earth. After that the living guests sit down to eat at
          the tables. Towards the end of the meal the host opens the window
          and lets the ghosts gently out of it by means of the shroud in
          which they were lowered into the grave. As they slide down it from
          the warm room into the outer air, the people tell them,
          “Now it is time for you to go home, and
          your feet must be tired; the way is not a little one for you to
          travel. Here it is softer for you. Now, in God's name,

          Among the
          Votiaks of Russia every family sacrifices to its dead once a year
          in the week before Palm Sunday. The sacrifice is offered in the
          house about midnight. Flesh, bread, or cakes and beer are set on
          the table, and on the floor beside the table stands a trough of
          bark with a lighted wax candle stuck on the rim. The master of the
          house, having covered his head with his hat, takes a piece of meat
          in his hand and says, “Ye spirits of the
          long departed, guard and preserve us well. Make none of us
          cripples. Send no plagues upon us. Cause the corn, the wine, and
          the food to prosper with us.” a id="noteref_156" name=

          Votiaks of the Governments of Wjatka and Kasan celebrate two
          memorial festivals of the dead every year, one in autumn and the
          other in spring. On a certain day koumiss is distilled, beer
          brewed, and potato scones baked in every house. All the members of
          a clan, who trace their descent through women from one mythical
          ancestress, assemble in a single house, generally in one which lies
          at the boundary of the clan land. Here an old man moulds wax
          candles; and when the requisite number is made he sticks them on
          the shelf of the stove, and begins to mention the dead relations of
          the master of the house by name. For each of them he crumbles a
          piece of bread, [pg
          077]
          gives each of them a piece of pancake, pours koumiss and beer, and
          puts a spoonful of soup into a trough made for the purpose. All
          persons present whose parents are dead follow his example. The dogs
          are then allowed to eat out of the trough. If they eat quietly, it
          is a sign that the dead live at peace; if they do not eat quietly,
          it argues the contrary. Then the company sit down to table and
          partake of the meal. Next morning both the dead and the living
          refresh themselves with a drink, and a fowl is boiled. The
          proceedings are the same as on the evening before. But now they
          treat the souls for the last time as a preparation for their
          journey, saying: “Eat, drink, and go home
          to your companions. Live at peace, be gracious to us, keep our
          children, guard our corn, our beasts and birds.” Then the
          people banquet and indulge in all sorts of improprieties. The women
          refrain from feasting until the dead have taken their departure;
          but when the souls are gone, there is no longer any motive for
          abstinence, the koumiss circulates freely among the women, and they
          grow wanton. Yet at this, as at every other festival, the men and
          women eat in different parts of the room. a id="noteref_157" name=

          On All Saints'
          Day, the first of November, shops and streets in the Abruzzi are
          filled with candles, which people buy in order to kindle them in
          the evening on the graves of their relations. For all the dead come
          to visit their homes that night, the Eve of All Souls, and they
          need lights to show them the way. For their use, too, lights are
          kept burning in the houses all night. Before people go to sleep
          they place on the table a lighted lamp or candle and a frugal meal
          of bread and water. The dead issue from their graves and stalk in
          procession through every street of the village. You can see them if
          you stand at a cross-road with your chin resting on a forked stick.
          First pass the souls of the good, and then the souls of the
          murdered and the damned. Once, they say, a man was thus peeping at
          the ghastly procession. The good souls told him he had  span class=

          In Shropshire
          down to the seventeenth century it was customary on All Souls' Day
          to set on the table a high heap of soul-cakes, and most visitors to
          the house took one of them. The antiquary John Aubrey, who records
          the custom, mentions also the appropriate verses:

          Indeed the
          custom of soul-cakes survived in Shropshire down to the latter part
          of the nineteenth century and may not be extinct even now.
          “With us, All Saints' Day is known as
          ‘Souling Day,’ and up to the present
          time in many places, poor children, and sometimes men, go out
          ‘souling’: which means that they go
          round to the houses of all the more well-to-do people within reach,
          reciting a ditty peculiar to the day, and looking for a dole of
          cakes, broken victuals, ale, apples, or money. The two latter are
          now the usual rewards, but there are few old North Salopians who
          cannot remember when ‘soul-cakes’
          were made at all the farms and  span class=

          Thus the
          practice of “souling” appears to
          have prevailed especially in the English counties which border on
          Wales. In many parts of Wales itself down to the first half of the
          nineteenth century poor peasants used to go about begging for bread
          on All Souls' Day. The bread bestowed on them was called
          bara
          ran or dole-bread. “This
          custom was a survival of the Middle Ages, when the poor begged
          bread for the souls of their departed relatives and
          friends.” a id="noteref_163" name="noteref_163" href=

          However, the custom was not confined to the west of England, for at
          Whitby in Yorkshire down to the early part of the nineteenth
          century it was usual to make “soul mass
          loaves” on or about All Souls' Day. They were small round
          loaves, sold by bakers at a farthing apiece, chiefly for presents

              Feast of All Souls among the
              Indians of Ecuador.
            
          

          The same mode of
          celebrating All Souls' Day has been transported by Catholicism to
          the New World and imparted to the aborigines of that continent.
          Thus in Carchi, a province of Ecuador, the Indians prepare foods of
          various sorts against All Souls' Day, and when the day has come
          they take some of the provisions to the church and there deposit
          them on tables set out for the purpose. These good things are the
          perquisite of the priest, who celebrates mass for the dead. After
          the service the Indians repair to the cemetery, where with burning
          candles and pots of holy water they prostrate themselves before the
          tombs of their relations, while the priest or the sacristan recites
          prayers for the souls of the departed. In the evening the Indians
          return to their houses. A table with four lights on it is spread
          with food and drink, especially with such things as the dead loved
          in their life. The door is left open all night, no doubt to let the
          spirits of the dead enter, and the family sits up, keeping the
          invisible guests company through the long hours of darkness. From
          seven o'clock and onwards troops of children traverse the village
          and its neighbourhood. They go from house to house ringing a bell
          and crying, “We are angels, we descend from
          the sky, we ask for bread.” The people go to their doors and
          beg the children to recite a  span lang="la" class=

          little of the food from the table. All night long this goes on,
          band succeeding band of children. At five o'clock in the morning
          the family consumes the remainder of the food of the souls. a id=

              The nominally Christian feast of
              All Souls on Nov. 2 appears to be an old Celtic festival of the
              dead adopted by the Church in 998  span class=

              Souls by the Abbot of Clugny.
            
          

          A comparison of
          these European customs with the similar heathen rites can leave no
          room for doubt that the nominally Christian feast of All Souls is
          nothing but an old pagan festival of the dead which the Church,
          unable or unwilling to suppress, resolved from motives of policy to
          connive at. But whence did it borrow the practice of solemnizing
          the festival on that particular day, the second of November? In
          order to answer this question we should observe, first, that
          celebrations of this sort are often held at the beginning of a New
          Year, a id="noteref_168" name="noteref_168" href=

          second, that the peoples of North-Western Europe, the Celts and the
          Teutons, appear to have dated the beginning of their year from the

          November a id="noteref_169" name="noteref_169" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">170 The
          difference of reckoning may be due to a difference of climate, the
          home of the Teutons in Central and Northern Europe being a region
          where winter sets in earlier than on the more temperate and humid
          coasts of the Atlantic, the home of the Celts. These considerations
          suggest that the festival of All Souls on the second of November
          originated with the Celts, and spread from them to the rest of the
          European peoples, who, while they preserved their old feasts of the
          dead practically unchanged, may have transferred them to the second
          of November. This conjecture is supported by what we know of the
          ecclesiastical institution, or rather recognition, of the festival.
          For [pg 082] a name=
          "Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"> that recognition was
          first accorded at the end of the tenth century in France, a Celtic
          country, from which the Church festival gradually spread over
          Europe. It was Odilo, abbot of the great Benedictine monastery of
          Clugny, who initiated the change in 998  span class=

          "font-variant: small-caps">a.d. by ordering that in
          all the monasteries over which he ruled, a solemn mass should be
          celebrated on the second of November for all the dead who sleep in
          Christ. The example thus set was followed by other religious
          houses, and the bishops, one after another, introduced the new
          celebration into their dioceses. Thus the festival of All Souls
          gradually established itself throughout Christendom, though in fact
          the Church has never formally sanctioned it by a general edict nor
          attached much weight to its observance. Indeed, when objections
          were raised to the festival at the Reformation, the ecclesiastical
          authorities seemed ready to abandon it. a id="noteref_171" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">171 These
          facts are explained very simply by the theory that an old Celtic
          commemoration of the dead lingered in France down to the end of the
          tenth century, and was then, as a measure of policy and a
          concession to ineradicable paganism, at last incorporated in the
          Catholic ritual. The consciousness of the heathen origin of the
          practice would naturally prevent the supreme authorities from
          insisting strongly on its observance. They appear rightly to have
          regarded it as an outpost which they could surrender to the forces
          of rationalism without endangering the citadel of the faith.

          

          
            
              The feast of All Saints on Nov. 1
              seems also to have displaced a heathen festival of the
              dead.
            
          

          Perhaps we may
          go a step further and explain in like manner the origin of the
          feast of All Saints on the first of November. For the analogy of
          similar customs elsewhere would lead us to suppose that the old
          Celtic festival of the dead was held on the Celtic New Year's Day,
          that is, on the first, not the second, of November. May not then
          the institution of the feast of All Saints on that day have been
          the first attempt of the Church to give a colour of Christianity to
          the ancient heathen rite by substituting the saints for the souls
          of the dead as the true object of worship?  span class="tei tei-pb"

          hypothesis. For the feast of All Saints was instituted in France

          hundred and sixty years before the introduction of the feast of All
          Souls. The innovation was made by the advice of the pope, Gregory
          IV., whose motive may well have been that of suppressing an old
          pagan custom which was still notoriously practised in France and
          Germany. The idea, however, was not a novel one, for the testimony
          of Bede proves that in Britain, another Celtic country, the feast
          of All Saints on the first of November was already celebrated in
          the eighth century. a id="noteref_172" name="noteref_172" href=

          may conjecture that this attempt to divert the devotion of the
          faithful from the souls of the dead to the saints proved a failure,

          popular superstition by frankly admitting a feast of All Souls into
          the calendar. But it could not assign the new, or rather the old,
          festival to the old day, the first of November, since that was
          already occupied by the feast of All Saints. Accordingly it placed
          the mass for the dead on the next day, the second of November. On
          this theory the feasts of All Saints and of All Souls mark two
          successive efforts of the Catholic Church to eradicate an old
          heathen festival of the dead. Both efforts failed.  span class=

              Osiris.
            
          

          The foregoing
          evidence lends some support to the conjecture—for it is only a
          conjecture—that the great festival of Osiris at Sais, with its
          accompanying illumination of the houses, was a night of All Souls,
          when the ghosts of the dead swarmed in the streets and revisited
          their old homes, which were lit up to welcome them back again.
          Herodotus, who briefly describes the festival, omits to mention its
          date, but we can determine it with some probability from other
          sources. Thus Plutarch tells us that Osiris was murdered on the
          seventeenth of the month Athyr, and that the Egyptians accordingly
          observed mournful rites for four days from the seventeenth of
          Athyr. a id="noteref_174" name="noteref_174" href=
          "#note_174"> span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">174 Now
          in the Alexandrian calendar, which Plutarch used, these four days
          corresponded to the thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and
          sixteenth of November, and this date answers exactly to the other
          indications given by Plutarch, who says that at the time of the
          festival the Nile was sinking, the north winds dying away, the
          nights lengthening, and the leaves falling from the trees. During
          these four days a gilt cow swathed in a black pall was exhibited as
          an image of Isis. [pg

          the nineteenth day of the month the people went down to the sea,
          the priests carrying a shrine which contained a golden casket. Into
          this casket they poured fresh water, and thereupon the spectators
          raised a shout that Osiris was found. After that they took some
          vegetable mould, moistened it with water, mixed it with precious
          spices and incense, and moulded the paste into a small moon-shaped
          image, which was then robed and ornamented. a id="noteref_176"

          resurrection of the dead god who came to life again in the new
          image of vegetable mould and spices. Lactantius tells us how on
          these occasions the priests, with their shaven bodies, beat their
          breasts and lamented, imitating the sorrowful search of Isis for
          her lost son Osiris, and how afterwards their sorrow was turned to
          joy when the jackal-headed god Anubis, or rather a mummer in his
          stead, produced a small boy, the living representative of the god

          The funeral
          rites of Osiris, as they were observed at his great festival in the
          sixteen provinces of Egypt, are described in a long inscription of
          the Ptolemaic period, which is engraved on the walls of the god's
          temple at Denderah, the Tentyra of the Greeks, a town of Upper
          Egypt situated on the western bank of the Nile about forty miles
          north of Thebes. a id="noteref_181" name="noteref_181" href=

          Unfortunately, while the information thus furnished is remarkably
          full and minute on many points, the arrangement adopted in the
          inscription is so confused and the expression often so obscure that
          a clear and consistent account of the ceremonies as a whole can
          hardly be extracted from it. Moreover, we learn from the document
          that the ceremonies varied somewhat in the several cities, the
          ritual of Abydos, for example, differing from that of Busiris.
          Without attempting to trace all the particularities of local usage
          I shall briefly indicate what seem to have been the leading
          features of the festival, so far as these can be ascertained with

              The rites of Osiris in the month
              of Khoiak represented the god as dead, dismembered, and then
              reconstituted by the union of his scattered limbs.
            
          

          The rites lasted
          eighteen days, from the twelfth to the thirtieth of the month
          Khoiak, and set forth the nature of Osiris in his triple aspect as
          dead, dismembered, and finally reconstituted by the union of his
          scattered limbs. In the first of these aspects he was called
          Chent-Ament (Khenti-Amenti), in the second Osiris-Sep, and in the
          third Sokari (Seker). a id="noteref_183" name="noteref_183" href=

          § 5. The Resurrection of
          Osiris.

          

          
            
              The resurrection of Osiris
              represented on the monuments.
            
          

          In the foregoing
          account of the festival, drawn from the great inscription of
          Denderah, the burial of Osiris figures prominently, while his
          resurrection is implied rather than expressed. This defect of the
          document, however, is amply compensated by a remarkable series of
          bas-reliefs which accompany and illustrate the inscription. These
          exhibit in a series of scenes the dead god lying swathed as a mummy
          on his bier, then gradually raising himself up higher and higher,
          until at last he has entirely quitted the bier and is seen erect
          between the guardian wings of the faithful Isis, who stands behind
          him, while a male figure holds up before his eyes the  span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">192 The
          resurrection of the god could hardly be portrayed more graphically.
          Even more instructive, however, is another representation of the
          same event in a chamber dedicated to Osiris in the great temple of
          Isis at Philae. Here we see the dead body of Osiris with stalks of
          corn springing from it, while a priest waters the stalks from a
          pitcher which he holds in his hand. The accompanying inscription
          sets forth that “this is the form of him
          whom one may not name, Osiris of the mysteries, who springs from
          the returning waters.” a id="noteref_193" name="noteref_193"

          together, the picture and the words seem to leave no doubt that

          the inundation. This, according to the inscription, was the kernel
          of the mysteries, the innermost secret revealed to the initiated.
          So in the rites of Demeter at Eleusis a reaped ear of corn was
          exhibited to the worshippers as the central mystery of their
          religion. a id="noteref_194" name="noteref_194" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">194 We
          can now fully understand why at the great festival of sowing in the
          month of Khoiak the priests used to bury effigies of Osiris made of
          earth and corn. When these effigies were taken up again at the end
          of a year or of a shorter interval, the corn would be found to have
          sprouted from the body of Osiris, and this sprouting of the grain
          would be hailed as an omen, or rather as the cause, of the growth
          of the crops. a id="noteref_195" name="noteref_195" href=

          And from the
          death and resurrection of their great god the Egyptians drew not
          only their support and sustenance in this life, but also their hope
          of a life eternal beyond the grave. This hope is indicated in the
          clearest manner by the very remarkable effigies of Osiris which
          have come to light in Egyptian cemeteries. Thus in the Valley of
          the Kings at Thebes there was found the tomb of a royal fan-bearer
          who lived about 1500  span style=

          contents of the tomb there was a bier on which rested a mattress of
          reeds covered with three layers of linen. On the upper side of the
          linen was painted a life-size figure of Osiris; and the interior of
          the figure, which was waterproof, contained a mixture of vegetable
          mould, barley, and a sticky fluid. The barley had sprouted and sent
          out shoots two or three inches long. a id="noteref_196" name=

          Again, in the cemetery at Cynopolis “were
          numerous burials of Osiris figures. These were made of grain

          § 6. Readjustment of Egyptian
          Festivals.

          

          
            
              The festivals of Osiris in the
              months of Athyr and Khoiak seem to have been substantially the
              same.
            
          

          The festival of
          Osiris which Plutarch assigns to the month of Athyr would seem to
          be identical in substance with the one which the inscription of
          Denderah assigns to the following month, namely, to Khoiak.
          Apparently the essence of both festivals was a dramatic
          representation of the death and resurrection of the god; in both of
          them Isis was figured by a gilt cow, and Osiris by an image moulded
          of moist vegetable earth. But if the festivals were the same, why
          were they held in different months? It is easy to suggest that
          different towns in Egypt celebrated the festival at different
          dates. But when we remember that according to the great inscription
          of Denderah, the authority of which is indisputable, the festival
          fell in the month of Khoiak in  span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page092">[pg 092] a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"> every province of Egypt, we shall be
          reluctant to suppose that at some one place, or even at a few
          places, it was exceptionally held in the preceding month of Athyr,
          and that the usually well-informed Plutarch described the exception
          as if it had been the rule, of which on this supposition he must
          have been wholly ignorant. More probably the discrepancy is to be
          explained by the great change which came over the Egyptian calendar
          between the date of the inscription and the lifetime of Plutarch.
          For when the inscription was drawn up in the Ptolemaic age the
          festivals were dated by the old vague or movable year, and
          therefore rotated gradually through the whole circle of the
          seasons; whereas at the time when Plutarch wrote, about the end of
          the first century, they were seemingly dated by the fixed
          Alexandrian year, and accordingly had ceased to rotate. a id=
          "noteref_201" name="noteref_201" href="#note_201"> span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"> span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">201

          

          
            
              The old festival of Khoiak may
              have been transferred to Athyr when the Egyptians adopted the
              fixed Alexandrian year in 30  span class=
              "tei tei-hi"> span style=
              "font-size: 80%; font-variant: small-caps">b.c.
            
          

          But even if we
          grant that in Plutarch's day the festivals had become stationary,
          still this would not explain why the old festival of Khoiak had
          been transferred to Athyr. In order to understand that transference
          it seems necessary to suppose that when the Egyptians gave to their
          months fixed places in the solar year by accepting the Alexandrian
          system of intercalation, they at the same time transferred the
          festivals from what may be called their artificial to their natural
          dates. Under the old system a summer festival was sometimes held in
          winter and a winter festival in summer; a harvest celebration
          sometimes fell at the season of sowing, and a sowing celebration at
          the season of harvest. People might reconcile themselves to such
          anomalies so long as they knew that they were only temporary, and
          that in the course of time the festivals would necessarily return
          to their proper seasons. But it must have been otherwise when they
          adopted a fixed instead of a movable year, and so arrested the
          rotation of the festivals for ever. For they could not but be aware
          that every festival would thenceforth continue to occupy for all
          time that particular place in the solar year which it chanced to
          occupy in the year 30  span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c., when the calendar
          became fixed. If in that particular year it happened, as it might

          festivals in summer, they would always be so held in future; the
          absurdity and anomaly would never again be rectified as it had been
          before. This consideration, which could not have escaped
          intelligent men, must have suggested the advisability of
          transferring the festivals from the dates at which they chanced to
          be celebrated in 30  span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c. to the dates at which
          they ought properly to be celebrated in the course of nature.

          

          
            
              The transference would be
              intelligible if we suppose that in 30  span class=

              the dates of all the Egyptian
              festivals were shifted backward by about a month in order to
              restore them to their natural places in the calendar.
            
          

          Now what in the
          year 30  span style=

          the fourth month Khoiak would thenceforth fall in the third month
          Athyr; and so on. Thus the festal calendar would be reduced to
          harmony with the seasons instead of being in more or less flagrant
          discord with them, as it had generally been before, and must always
          have been afterwards if the change which I have indicated had not
          been introduced. It is only to credit the native astronomers and
          the Roman rulers of Egypt with common sense to suppose that they
          actually adopted the measure. On that supposition we can perfectly
          understand why the festival of sowing, which had formerly belonged
          to the month of Khoiak, was transferred to Athyr. For in the
          Alexandrian calendar Khoiak corresponds very nearly to December,
          and Athyr to November. But in Egypt the month of November, not the
          month of December, is the season of sowing. There was therefore
          every reason why the great sowing festival of the corn-god Osiris
          should be held in Athyr and not Khoiak, in November and not in
          December. In like manner we may suppose that all the Egyptian
          festivals were restored to their true places in the solar year, and
          that when Plutarch dates a festival both by its calendar month and
          by its relation to [pg

          the cycle of the seasons, he is perfectly right in doing so, and we
          may accept his evidence with confidence instead of having to accuse
          him of ignorantly confounding the movable Egyptian with the fixed
          Alexandrian year. Accusations of ignorance levelled at the best
          writers of antiquity are apt to recoil on those who make

        Chapter V. The Nature of
        Osiris.

        
           

          
          § 1. Osiris a Corn-God.

          

          
            
              Osiris in one of his aspects a
              personification of the corn. Osiris a child of Sky and Earth.
              The legend of the dismemberment of Osiris points to the
              dismemberment of human beings, perhaps of the kings, in the
              character of the corn-spirit.
            
          

          The foregoing
          survey of the myth and ritual of Osiris may suffice to prove that
          in one of his aspects the god was a personification of the corn,
          which may be said to die and come to life again every year. Through
          all the pomp and glamour with which in later times the priests had
          invested his worship, the conception of him as the corn-god comes
          clearly out in the festival of his death and resurrection, which
          was celebrated in the month of Khoiak and at a later period in the
          month of Athyr. That festival appears to have been essentially a
          festival of sowing, which properly fell at the time when the
          husbandman actually committed the seed to the earth. On that
          occasion an effigy of the corn-god, moulded of earth and corn, was
          buried with funeral rites in the ground in order that, dying there,
          he might come to life again with the new crops. The ceremony was,
          in fact, a charm to ensure the growth of the corn by sympathetic
          magic, and we may conjecture that as such it was practised in a
          simple form by every Egyptian farmer on his fields long before it
          was adopted and transfigured by the priests in the stately ritual
          of the temple. In the modern, but doubtless ancient, Arab custom of
          burying “the Old Man,” namely, a
          sheaf of wheat, in the harvest-field and praying that he may return
          from the dead, a id="noteref_205" name="noteref_205" href=

          directly to the Nile and not to showers; but the inhabitants must

          either the sowing or the winnowing of the grain. The latter

          Dionysus for the sake of the crops. A man disguised in goatskins

          the age of forty through the breaking of the ice in spring. What
          followed his death is thus related by the old Norse historian
          Snorri Sturluson: “He had been the most
          prosperous (literally, blessed with abundance) of all kings. So
          greatly did men value him that when the news came that he was dead
          and his body removed to Hringariki and intended for burial there,
          the chief men from Raumariki and Westfold and Heithmörk came and
          all requested that they might take his body with them and bury it
          in their various provinces; they thought that it would bring
          abundance to those who obtained it. Eventually it was settled that
          the body was distributed in four places. The head was laid in a
          barrow at Steinn in Hringariki, and each party took away their own
          share and buried it. All these barrows are called Halfdan's

          The natives of
          Kiwai, an island lying off the mouth of the Fly River in British
          New Guinea, tell of a certain magician named Segera, who had sago
          for his totem. When his son died, the death was set down to the
          magic of an enemy, and the bereaved father was so angry that by his
          spells he caused the whole crop of sago in the country to fail;
          only in his own garden the sago grew as luxuriantly as ever. When
          many had died of famine, the people went to him and begged him to
          remove the spells which he had cast on the sago palms, so that they
          might eat food and live. The magician, touched with remorse and
          pity, went round planting a sago shoot in every garden, and the
          shoots flourished, sago was plentiful once more, and the famine
          came to an end. When Segera was old and ill, he told the people
          that he would soon die, but that, nevertheless, he would cause
          their gardens to thrive. Accordingly, he instructed them that when
          he was dead they should cut him up and place pieces of his flesh in
          their gardens, but his head was to be buried in his own garden. Of
          him it is said that he outlived the ordinary age, and that no man
          knew his father, but that he made the sago good and no one was
          hungry any more. Old men who were alive a few years ago affirmed
          that they had known Segera in their youth, and the general opinion
          of the Kiwai people seems to be that Segera died not more than two
          generations ago. a id="noteref_225" name="noteref_225" href=

          for the good of his subjects, quickening the seed in the earth and
          in the womb. This radiation of reproductive energy did not cease
          with his life; hence the people deemed it essential to preserve his
          body as a pledge of the continued prosperity of the country. It
          would be natural to imagine that the spot where the dead king was
          buried would enjoy a more than ordinary share of his blessed
          influence, and accordingly disputes would almost inevitably arise
          between different districts for the exclusive possession of so
          powerful a talisman. These disputes could be settled and local
          jealousies appeased by dividing the precious body between the rival
          claimants, in order that all should benefit in equal measure by its
          life-giving properties. This was certainly done in Norway with the
          body of Halfdan the Black, the descendant of the harvest-god Frey;
          it appears to have been done with the body of Segera, the
          sago-magician of Kiwai; and we may conjecture that in prehistoric
          times it was done with the bodies of Egyptian kings, who personated
          Osiris, the god of fertility in general and of the corn in
          particular. At least such a practice would account for the legend
          of the mangling of the god's body and the distribution of the
          pieces throughout Egypt.

          

          
            
              In this dismemberment a special
              virtue seems to have been ascribed to the genital
              organs.
            
          

          In this
          connexion the story that the genital member of Osiris was missing
          when Isis pieced together his mutilated body, a id="noteref_226"

              The Egyptian kings probably
              opposed the custom and succeeded in abolishing it. Precautions
              taken to preserve the bodies of kings from mutilation.
            
          

          To an ancient
          Egyptian, with his firm belief in a personal immortality dependent
          on the integrity of the body, the prospect of mutilation after
          death must have been very repugnant; and we may suppose that the
          kings offered a strenuous resistance to the custom and finally
          succeeded in abolishing it. They may have represented to the people
          that they would attain their object better by keeping the royal
          corpse intact than by frittering it away in small pieces. Their
          subjects apparently acquiesced in the argument, or at all events in
          the conclusion; yet the mountains of masonry beneath which the old
          Egyptian kings lay buried may have been intended to guard them from
          the superstitious devotion of their friends quite as much as from
          the hostile designs of their enemies, since both alike must have
          been under a strong temptation to violate the sanctity of the grave
          in order to possess themselves of bodies which were believed to be
          endowed with magical virtue of the most tremendous potency. In
          antiquity the safety of the state was often believed to depend on
          the possession of a talisman, which sometimes consisted of the
          bones of a king or hero. Hence the graves of such persons were

          insulting or even eating his body. In some places the dead chief is
          buried in his own house, and armed warriors of his mother's kin
          keep watch night and day over his grave. After a time his bones are
          taken up and carried by night to some far-away inaccessible cave in
          the mountains, whose position is known only to a few trustworthy
          men. Ladders are constructed to enable them to reach the cave, and
          are taken down when the bones have been deposited there. Many

              Among the Koniags of Alaska the

          Beliefs and
          practices of this sort are by no means confined to agricultural
          peoples. Among the Koniags of Alaska “in

          superstitious observances kept a secret by the hunters. Lieutenant
          Davidof states that the whalers preserved the bodies of brave or
          distinguished men in secluded caves, and before proceeding upon a
          whale-hunt would carry these dead bodies into a stream and then
          drink of the water thus tainted. One famous whaler of Kadiak who
          desired to flatter Baranof, the first chief manager of the Russian
          colonies, said to him, ‘When you die I
          shall try to steal your body,’ intending thus to express his
          great respect for Baranof. On the occasion of the death of a whaler
          his fellows would cut the body into pieces, each man taking one of
          them for the purpose of rubbing his spear-heads therewith. These
          pieces were dried or otherwise preserved, and were frequently taken

          But Osiris was
          more than a spirit of the corn; he was also a tree-spirit, and this
          may perhaps have been his primitive character, since the worship of
          trees is naturally older in the history of religion than the
          worship of the cereals. However that may have been, to an
          agricultural people like the Egyptians, who depended almost wholly
          on their crops, the corn-god was naturally a far more important
          [pg 108] a name=
          "Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"> personage than the
          tree-god, and attracted a larger share of their devotion. The
          character of Osiris as a tree-spirit was represented very

          or five cross-bars, like superposed capitals, at the top. The whole
          roughly resembled a telegraph-post with the cross-pieces which
          support the wires. Sometimes on the monuments a human form is given
          to the pillar by carving a grotesque face on it, robing the lower
          part, crowning the top with the symbols of Osiris, and adding two
          arms which hold two other characteristic emblems of the god, the
          crook and the scourge or flail. On a Theban tomb the king himself,
          assisted by his relations and a priest, is represented hauling at
          the ropes by which the pillar is being raised, while the queen
          looks on and her sixteen daughters accompany the ceremony with the
          music of rattles and sistrums. Again, in the hall of the Osirian
          mysteries at Abydos the King Sety I. and the goddess Isis are
          depicted raising the column between them. In Egyptian theology the
          pillar was interpreted as the backbone of Osiris, and whatever its
          meaning [pg
          109]
          may have been, it was one of the holiest symbols of the national
          religion. It might very well be a conventional way of representing
          a tree stripped of its leaves; and if Osiris was a tree-spirit, the
          bare trunk and branches might naturally be described as his
          backbone. The setting up of the column would thus, as several
          modern scholars believe, shadow forth the resurrection of the god,
          and the importance of the occasion would explain and justify the
          prominent part which the king appears to have taken in the
          ceremony. a id="noteref_251" name="noteref_251" href=

              Osiris perhaps conceived as a god
              of fertility in general.
            
          

          As a god of
          vegetation Osiris was naturally conceived as a god of creative
          energy in general, since men at a certain stage of evolution fail
          to distinguish between the reproductive powers of animals and of
          plants. Hence a striking feature in his worship was the coarse but
          expressive symbolism by which this aspect of his nature was
          presented to the eye not merely of the initiated but of the
          multitude. At his festival women used to go about the villages
          singing songs in his praise and carrying obscene images of him
          which they set in motion by means of strings. a id="noteref_273"

          misjudge ancient religion to denounce as lewd and profligate the
          emblems and the ceremonies which the Egyptians employed for the
          purpose of giving effect to this conception of the divine power.
          The ends which they proposed to themselves in these rites were
          natural and laudable; only the means they adopted to compass them
          were mistaken. A similar fallacy induced the Greeks to adopt a like
          symbolism in their Dionysiac festivals, and the superficial but
          striking resemblance thus produced between the two religions has

        Similarly Dr. Budge writes that “Isis was the
        great and beneficent goddess and mother, whose influence and love
        pervaded all heaven and earth and the abode of the dead, and she was
        the personification of the great feminine, creative power which
        conceived, and brought forth every living creature and thing, from
        the gods in heaven to man on the earth, and to the insect on the
        ground; what she brought forth she protected, and cared for, and fed,
        and nourished, and she employed her life in using her power
        graciously and successfully, not only in creating new beings but in
        restoring those that were dead. She was, besides these things, the
        highest type of a faithful and loving wife  span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page116">[pg 116] a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class=

            How Isis resembled yet differed from
            the Mother Goddesses of Asia. Isis perhaps originally a goddess
            of the corn.
          
        

        Thus in her
        character of a goddess of fecundity Isis answered to the great mother
        goddesses of Asia, though she differed from them in the chastity and
        fidelity of her conjugal life; for while they were unmarried and
        dissolute, she had a husband and was a true wife to him as well as an
        affectionate mother to their son. Hence her beautiful Madonna-like
        figure reflects a more refined state of society and of morals than
        the coarse, sensual, cruel figures of Astarte, Anaitis, Cybele, and
        the rest of that crew. A clear trace, indeed, of an ethical standard
        very different from our own lingers in her double relation of sister
        and wife to Osiris; but in most other respects she is rather late
        than primitive, the full-blown flower rather than the seed of a long
        religious development. The attributes ascribed to her were too
        various to be all her own. They were graces borrowed from many lesser
        deities, sweets rifled from a thousand humbler plants to feed the
        honey of her superb efflorescence. Yet in her complex nature it is
        perhaps still possible to detect the original nucleus round which by
        a slow process of accretion the other elements gathered. For if her
        brother and husband Osiris was in one of his aspects the corn-god, as
        we have seen reason to believe, she must surely have been the
        corn-goddess. There are at least some grounds for thinking so. For if
        we may trust Diodorus Siculus, whose authority appears to have been
        the Egyptian historian Manetho, the discovery of wheat and barley was
        attributed to Isis, and at her festivals stalks of these grains were
        carried in procession to commemorate the boon she had conferred on
        men. a id="noteref_285" name="noteref_285" href=
        "#note_285"> span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">285 A
        further detail is added by Augustine. He says that Isis made the
        discovery of barley at the moment when she was sacrificing to the
        common ancestors of her husband and herself, all of whom had been
        kings, and that she showed the newly discovered ears of barley to
        Osiris and his councillor Thoth or Mercury, as Roman writers called
        him. That is why, [pg

            Refinement and spiritualization of
            Isis in later times: the popularity of her worship in the Roman
            empire. Resemblance of Isis to the Madonna.
          
        

        Such, we may
        suppose, was Isis in the olden time, a rustic Corn-Mother adored with
        uncouth rites by Egyptian swains. But the homely features of the
        clownish goddess could hardly be traced in the refined, the saintly
        form which, spiritualized by ages of religious evolution, she
        presented to her worshippers of after days as the true wife, the
        tender [pg 118] a name=
        "Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"> mother, the beneficent
        queen of nature, encircled with the nimbus of moral purity, of
        immemorial and mysterious sanctity. Thus chastened and transfigured
        she won many hearts far beyond the boundaries of her native land. In
        that welter of religions which accompanied the decline of national
        life in antiquity her worship was one of the most popular at Rome and
        throughout the empire. Some of the Roman emperors themselves were
        openly addicted to it. a id="noteref_296" name="noteref_296" href=
        "#note_296"> span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">296 And
        however the religion of Isis may, like any other, have been often
        worn as a cloak by men and women of loose life, her rites appear on
        the whole to have been honourably distinguished by a dignity and
        composure, a solemnity and decorum well fitted to soothe the troubled
        mind, to ease the burdened heart. They appealed therefore to gentle
        spirits, and above all to women, whom the bloody and licentious rites
        of other Oriental goddesses only shocked and repelled. We need not
        wonder, then, that in a period of decadence, when traditional faiths
        were shaken, when systems clashed, when men's minds were disquieted,
        when the fabric of empire itself, once deemed eternal, began to show
        ominous rents and fissures, the serene figure of Isis with her
        spiritual calm, her gracious promise of immortality, should have
        appeared to many like a star in a stormy sky, and should have roused
        in their breasts a rapture of devotion not unlike that which was paid
        in the Middle Ages to the Virgin Mary. Indeed her stately ritual,
        with its shaven and tonsured priests, its matins and vespers, its
        tinkling music, its baptism and aspersions of holy water, its solemn

        Chapter VII. Osiris and the
        Sun.

        

        
          
            Osiris interpreted as the sun by
            many modern writers.
          
        

        Osiris has been
        sometimes interpreted as the sun-god; and in modern times this view
        has been held by so many distinguished writers that it deserves a
        brief examination. If we inquire on what evidence Osiris has been
        identified with the sun or the sun-god, it will be found on analysis
        to be minute in quantity and dubious, where it is not absolutely
        worthless, in quality. The diligent Jablonski, the first modern
        scholar to collect and sift the testimony of classical writers on
        Egyptian religion, says that it can be shown in many ways that Osiris
        is the sun, and that he could produce a cloud of witnesses to prove
        it, but that it is needless to do so, since no learned man is
        ignorant of the fact. a id="noteref_302" name="noteref_302" href=
        "#note_302"> span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">302 Of the
        writers whom he condescends to quote, the only two who expressly
        identify Osiris with the sun are Diodorus and Macrobius. The passage
        in Diodorus runs thus: a id="noteref_303" name="noteref_303" href=
        "#note_303"> span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">303
        “It is said that the aboriginal inhabitants
        of Egypt, looking up to the sky, and smitten with awe and wonder at
        the nature of the universe, supposed that there were two gods,
        eternal and primaeval, the sun and the moon, of whom they named the
        sun Osiris and the moon Isis.” Even if Diodorus's authority
        for this statement is Manetho, as there is some ground for
        believing, a id="noteref_304" name="noteref_304" href=
        "#note_304"> span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">304 little
        or no weight can be attached to it. For it is plainly a
        philosophical, and therefore a late, explanation of the first
        beginnings of Egyptian religion, reminding us of Kant's familiar
        saying about the starry heavens and the moral law rather than of the
        [pg 121] a name="Pg121"
        id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"> rude traditions of a primitive
        people. Jablonski's second authority, Macrobius, is no better, but
        rather worse. For Macrobius was the father of that large family of
        mythologists who resolve all or most gods into the sun. According to
        him Mercury was the sun, Mars was the sun, Janus was the sun, Saturn
        was the sun, so was Jupiter, also Nemesis, likewise Pan, and so on
        through a great part of the pantheon. a id="noteref_305" name=

        Further, he argues that Osiris must be the sun because an eye was one
        of his symbols. It is true that an eye was a symbol of Osiris, a id=

            The later identification of Osiris
            with Ra, the sun-god, does not prove that Osiris was originally
            the sun. Such identifications sprang from attempts to unify and
            amalgamate the many local cults of Egypt.
          
        

        Amongst modern
        scholars, Lepsius, in identifying Osiris with the sun, appears to
        rely mainly on the passage of Diodorus already quoted. But the
        monuments, he adds, also show “that down to a
        late time Osiris was sometimes conceived as  span class=

        In this quality he is named  span class=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">311 That Ra
        was both the physical sun and the sun-god is undisputed; but with
        every deference for the authority of so great a scholar as Lepsius,
        we may doubt whether the identification of Osiris with Ra can be
        accepted as proof that Osiris was originally the sun. For the
        religion of ancient Egypt a id="noteref_312" name="noteref_312" href=
        "#note_312"> span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">312 may be
        described as a confederacy of local cults which, while maintaining
        against each other a certain measure of jealous and even hostile
        independence, were yet constantly subjected to the fusing and
        amalgamating influence of political centralization and philosophic
        thought. The history of the religion appears to have largely
        consisted of a struggle between these opposite forces or tendencies.
        On the one side there was the conservative tendency to preserve the
        local cults with all their distinctive features, fresh, sharp, and
        crisp as they had been handed down from an immemorial past. On the
        other side there was the progressive tendency, favoured by the
        gradual fusion of the people under a powerful central government,
        first to dull the edge of these provincial distinctions, and finally
        to break them down completely and merge them in a single national
        religion. The conservative party probably mustered in its ranks the
        great bulk of the people, their prejudices and affections being
        warmly enlisted in favour of the local deity, with whose temple and
        rites they had been familiar from childhood; and the popular dislike
        of change, based on the endearing effect of old association, must
        have been strongly reinforced by the less disinterested opposition of
        the local clergy, whose material interests would necessarily suffer
        with any decay of their shrines. On the other hand the kings, whose
        power and glory rose with the political and ecclesiastical
        consolidation of the realm, were the natural champions of religious
        unity; and their efforts would be seconded by the refined and
        [pg 123] a name="Pg123"
        id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"> thoughtful minority, who could
        hardly fail to be shocked by the many barbarous and revolting
        elements in the local rites. As usually happens in such cases, the
        process of religious unification appears to have been largely
        effected by discovering points of similarity, real or imaginary,
        between the provincial deities, which were thereupon declared to be
        only different names or manifestations of the same god.

        

        
          
            Most Egyptian gods were at some time
            identified with the sun. Attempt of Amenophis IV. to abolish all
            gods except the sun-god. Failure of the attempt.
          
        

        Of the deities who
        thus acted as centres of attraction, absorbing in themselves a
        multitude of minor divinities, by far the most important was the
        sun-god Ra. There appear to have been few gods in Egypt who were not
        at one time or other identified with him. Ammon of Thebes, Horus of
        the East, Horus of Edfu, Chnum of Elephantine, Tum of Heliopolis, all
        were regarded as one god, the sun. Even the water-god Sobk, in spite
        of his crocodile shape, did not escape the same fate. Indeed one
        king, Amenophis IV., undertook to sweep away all the old gods at a
        stroke and replace them by a single god, the  span class=

        “who bringeth the years, createth the months,
        maketh the days, calculateth the hours, the lord of time, by whom men
        reckon.” In his zeal for the unity of god, the king commanded
        to erase the names of all other gods from the monuments, and to
        destroy their images. His rage was particularly directed against the
        god Ammon, whose name and likeness were effaced wherever they were
        found; even the sanctity of the tomb was violated in order to destroy
        the memorials of the hated deity. In some of the halls of the great
        temples at Carnac, Luxor, and other places, all the names of the
        gods, with a few chance exceptions, were scratched out. The monarch
        even changed his own name, Amenophis, because it was compounded of
        Ammon, and took instead the name of Chu-en-aten,  span class=
        "tei tei-q">“gleam of the sun's disc.” Thebes itself, the
        ancient capital of his glorious ancestors, full of the monuments of
        their piety and idolatry, was no longer a fit home for the puritan
        king. He deserted it, and built for himself a new capital in Middle
        Egypt at the place now known as Tell-el-Amarna. Here in a few years a
        city of palaces and gardens rose like an exhalation at his command,
        and here the king, his dearly loved wife and children, and his
        complaisant courtiers led a merry life. The grave and sombre ritual
        of Thebes was discarded. The sun-god was worshipped with songs and
        hymns, with the music of harps and flutes, with offerings of cakes
        and fruits and flowers. Blood seldom stained his kindly altars. The
        king himself celebrated the offices of religion. He preached with
        unction, and we may be sure that his courtiers listened with at least
        an outward semblance of devotion. From the too-faithful portraits of
        himself which he has bequeathed to us we can still picture to
        ourselves the heretic king in the pulpit, with his tall, lanky
        figure, his bandy legs, his pot-belly, his long, lean, haggard face
        aglow with the fever of religious fanaticism. Yet  span class=

        and of a life beyond the grave, which weighed like a nightmare on the
        minds of the Egyptians, seem to have been banished for a time. Even
        the name of Osiris, the awful judge of the dead, is not once
        mentioned in the graves at Tell-el-Amarna. All this lasted only
        during the life of the reformer. His death was followed by a violent
        reaction. The old gods were reinstated in their rank and privileges:
        their names and images were restored, and new temples were built. But
        all the shrines and palaces reared by the late king were thrown down:
        even the sculptures that referred to him and to his god in rock-tombs
        and on the sides of hills were erased or filled up with stucco: his
        name appears on no later monument, and was carefully omitted from all
        official lists. The new capital was abandoned, never to be inhabited
        again. Its plan can still be traced in the sands of the desert.

        

        
          
            Identification with the sun is no
            evidence of the original character of an Egyptian god.
          
        

        This attempt of
        King Amenophis IV. is only an extreme example of a tendency which
        appears to have affected the religion of Egypt as far back as we can
        trace it. Therefore, to come back to our point, in attempting to
        discover the original character of any Egyptian god, no weight can be
        given to the identification of him with other gods, least of all with
        the sun-god Ra. Far from helping to follow up the trail, these
        identifications only cross and confuse it. The best evidence for the
        original character of the Egyptian gods is to be found in their
        ritual and myths, so far as these are known, and in the manner in
        which they are portrayed on the monuments. It is mainly on evidence
        drawn from these sources that I rest my interpretation of Osiris.

        

        
          
            The solar theory of Osiris does not
            explain his death and resurrection.
          
        

        The ground upon
        which some modern writers seem chiefly to rely for the identification
        of Osiris with the sun is that the story of his death fits better
        with the solar phenomena than with any other in nature. It may
        readily be admitted that the daily appearance and disappearance of
        the sun might very naturally be expressed by a myth of his death and
        resurrection; and writers who regard Osiris as the sun are careful to
        indicate that it is the diurnal, and not the annual, course of the
        sun to which they understand the  span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page126">[pg 126] a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"> myth to apply. Thus Renouf, who identified
        Osiris with the sun, admitted that the Egyptian sun could not with
        any show of reason be described as dead in winter. a id="noteref_314"
        name="noteref_314" href="#note_314"> span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"> span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">314 But if
        his daily death was the theme of the legend, why was it celebrated by
        an annual ceremony? This fact alone seems fatal to the interpretation
        of the myth as descriptive of sunset and sunrise. Again, though the
        sun may be said to die daily, in what sense can he be said to be torn
        in pieces? a id="noteref_315" name="noteref_315" href=
        "#note_315"> span style=

            The death and resurrection of Osiris
            are more naturally explained by the annual decay and growth of
            vegetation.
          
        

        In the course of
        our inquiry it has, I trust, been made clear that there is another
        natural phenomenon to which the conception of death and resurrection
        is as applicable as to sunset and sunrise, and which, as a matter of
        fact, has been so conceived and represented in folk-custom. That
        phenomenon is the annual growth and decay of vegetation. A strong
        reason for interpreting the death of Osiris as the decay of
        vegetation rather than as the sunset is to be found in the general,
        though not unanimous, voice of antiquity, which classed together the
        worship and myths of Osiris, Adonis, Attis, Dionysus, and Demeter, as
        religions of essentially the same type. a id="noteref_316" name=

        Dionysus so great, that he thought it impossible the latter could
        have arisen independently; they must, he supposed, have been recently

        alternative of either dismissing as mistaken the testimony of
        antiquity to the similarity of the rites of Osiris, Adonis, Attis,
        Dionysus, and Demeter, or of interpreting all these rites as

        Chapter VIII. Osiris and the
        Moon.

        

        
          
            Osiris was sometimes interpreted by
            the ancients as the moon.
          
        

        Before we conclude
        this study of Osiris it will be worth while to consider an ancient
        view of his nature, which deserves more attention than it has
        received in modern times. We are told by Plutarch that among the
        philosophers who saw in the gods of Egypt personifications of natural
        objects and forces, there were some who interpreted Osiris as the
        moon and his enemy Typhon as the sun,  span class=
        "tei tei-q">“because the moon, with her humid and generative light,
        is favourable to the propagation of animals and the growth of plants;
        while the sun with his fierce fire scorches and burns up all growing
        things, renders the greater part of the earth uninhabitable by reason
        of his blaze, and often overpowers the moon herself.” a id=

        Whatever may be thought of the physical qualities here attributed to
        the moon, the arguments adduced by the ancients to prove the identity
        of Osiris with that luminary carry with them a weight which has at
        least not been lightened by the results of modern research. An
        examination of them and of other evidence pointing in the same
        direction will, perhaps, help to set the original character of the

        Here then Osiris
        is identified with the moon in set terms. If in the same hymn he is
        said to “illuminate us like Ra” (the
        sun), that is obviously no reason for identifying him with the sun,
        but quite the contrary. For though the moon may reasonably be
        compared to the sun, neither the sun nor anything else can reasonably
        be compared to itself.

        8. In art Osiris
        is sometimes represented as a human-headed mummy grasping in his
        hands his characteristic emblems and wearing on his head, instead of
        the usual crown, a full moon within a crescent. a id="noteref_335"

            The identification of Osiris with
            the moon appears to be based on a comparatively late theory that
            all things grow and decay with the waxing and waning of the
            moon.
          
        

        Now if in one of
        his aspects Osiris was originally a deity of vegetation, we can
        easily enough understand why in a later and more philosophic age he
        should come to be thus identified or confounded with the moon. a id=

        certain obvious, though fallacious, appearances to regard the moon as
        the ultimate cause of the growth of plants. In the first place he
        associates its apparent growth and decay with the growth and decay of
        sublunary things, and imagines that in virtue of a secret sympathy
        the celestial phenomena really produce those terrestrial changes

        the increase of the moon and that bloodless creatures especially feel
        breath at that time; even the blood of men grows and diminishes with

        From this supposed
        influence of the moon on the life of plants and animals, men in

        ancient writer on agriculture lays it down as a maxim, that whatever

        apparently because it was [pg

        thought fit and natural that the operation of cutting down should be
        performed on earth at the time when the lunar orb was, so to say,
        being cut down in the sky. In France before the Revolution the
        forestry laws enjoined that trees should only be felled after the

        thickly on cloudless nights, they inferred wrongly that it was caused

            The moon, being viewed as the cause
            of vegetable growth, is naturally worshipped by agricultural
            peoples.
          
        

        Thus misled by a
        double fallacy primitive philosophy comes to view the moon as the
        great cause of vegetable growth, first, because the planet seems
        itself to grow, and second, because it is supposed to be the source
        of dew and moisture. It is no wonder, therefore, that agricultural
        peoples should adore the planet which they believe to influence so
        profoundly the crops on which they depend for subsistence.
        Accordingly we find that in the hotter regions of America, where
        maize is cultivated and manioc is the staple food, the moon was
        recognized as the principal object of worship, and plantations of
        manioc were assigned to it as a return for the service it rendered in
        the production of the crops. The worship of the moon in preference to
        the sun was general among the Caribs, and, perhaps, also among most
        of the other Indian tribes who cultivated maize in the tropical
        forests to the east of the Andes; and the same thing has been
        observed, under the same physical conditions, among the aborigines of
        the hottest region of Peru, the northern valleys of Yuncapata. Here
        the Indians of Pacasmayu and the neighbouring valleys revered the
        moon as their principal divinity. The “house
        of the moon” at Pacasmayu was the chief temple of the
        district; and the same sacrifices of maize-flour, of wine, and of
        children which were offered by the mountaineers of the Andes to the
        Sun-god, were offered by the lowlanders to the Moon-god in order that
        he might cause their crops to thrive. a id="noteref_369" name=

        furnished them with the means of subsistence, the ancient Egyptians
        should in later times have identified the spirit of the corn with the
        moon, which a false philosophy had taught them to regard as the
        ultimate cause of the growth of vegetation. In this way we can
        understand why in their most recent forms the myth and ritual of
        Osiris, the old god of trees and corn, should bear many traces of
        efforts made to bring them into a superficial conformity with the new
        doctrine of his lunar affinity.

        Chapter IX. The Doctrine of Lunar
        Sympathy.

        

        
          
            The doctrine of lunar
            sympathy.
          
        

        In the preceding
        chapter some evidence was adduced of the sympathetic influence which
        the waxing or waning moon is popularly supposed to exert on growth,
        especially on the growth of vegetation. But the doctrine of lunar
        sympathy does not stop there; it is applied also to the affairs of
        man, and various customs and rules have been deduced from it which
        aim at the amelioration and even the indefinite extension of human
        life. To illustrate this application of the popular theory at length
        would be out of place here, but a few cases may be mentioned by way
        of specimen.

        

        
          
            Theory that all things wax or wane
            with the moon. The ceremonies observed at new moon are often
            magical rather than religious, being intended to renew
            sympathetically the life of man.
          
        

        The natural fact
        on which all the customs in question seem to rest is the apparent
        monthly increase and decrease of the moon. From this observation men
        have inferred that all things simultaneously wax or wane in sympathy
        with it. a id="noteref_371" name="noteref_371" href=

        period of her revolution they carefully avoid to engage in any

        steadfastly at the moon in the basin, then shut his eyes and drink
        the water at one gulp. Doctors recommend the draught as a remedy for
        nervous disorders and palpitation of the heart. Somewhat similar
        customs prevail among the Hindoos of Northern India. At the full moon
        of the month of Kuar (September-October) people lay out food on the
        house-tops, and when it has absorbed the rays of the moon they
        distribute it among their relations, who are supposed to lengthen
        their life by eating of the food which has thus been saturated with

        after its birth in order that it may grow fast and talk soon. a id=

        the Apinagos Indians, on the Tocantins River in Brazil, the French
        traveller Castelnau witnessed a remarkable dance by moonlight. The
        Indians danced in two long ranks which faced each other, the women on
        one side, the men on the other. Between the two ranks of dancers
        blazed a great fire. The men were painted in brilliant colours, and
        for the most part wore white or red skull-caps made of maize-flour
        and resin. Their dancing was very monotonous and consisted of a jerky
        movement of the body, while the dancer advanced first one leg and
        then the other. This dance they accompanied with a melancholy song,
        striking the ground with their weapons. Opposite them the women,
        naked and unpainted, stood in a single rank, their bodies bent
        slightly forward, their knees pressed together, their arms swinging
        in measured time, now forward, now backward, so as to join hands. A
        remarkable figure in the dance was a personage painted scarlet all
        over, who held in his hand a rattle composed of a gourd full of
        pebbles. From time to time he leaped across the great fire which
        burned between the men and the women. Then he would run rapidly in
        front of the women, stopping now and then before one or other and
        performing a series of strange gambols, while he shook his rattle
        violently. Sometimes he would sink with one knee to the ground, and
        then suddenly throw himself backward. Altogether the agility and
        endurance which he displayed were remarkable. This dance lasted for
        hours. When a woman was tired out she withdrew, and her place was
        taken by another; but the same men danced the monotonous dance all
        night. Towards midnight the moon attained the zenith and flooded the
        scene with her bright rays. A change  span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page146">[pg 146] a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class=

        and women advanced to the fire between the ranks of the dancers. Each
        of them held one end of a hammock in which lay a new-born infant,
        whose squalls could be heard. These babes were now to be presented by
        their parents to the moon. On reaching the end of the line each
        couple swung the hammock, accompanying the movement by a chant, which
        all the Indians sang in chorus. The song seemed to consist of three
        words, repeated over and over again. Soon a shrill voice was heard,
        and a hideous old hag, like a skeleton, appeared with her arms raised
        above her head. She went round and round the assembly several times,
        then disappeared in silence. While she was present, the scarlet
        dancer with the rattle bounded about more furiously than ever,
        stopping only for a moment while he passed in front of the line of
        women. His body was contracted and bent towards them, and described
        an undulatory movement like that of a worm writhing. He shook his
        rattle violently, as if he would fain kindle in the women the fire
        which burned in himself. Then rising abruptly he would resume his
        wild career. During this time the loud voice of an orator was heard
        from the village repeating a curious name without cessation. Then the
        speaker approached slowly, carrying on his back some gorgeous bunches
        of brilliant feathers and under his arm a stone axe. Behind him
        walked a young woman bearing an infant in a loose girdle at her
        waist; the child was wrapped in a mat, which protected it against the
        chill night air. The couple paced slowly for a minute or two, and
        then vanished without speaking a word. At the same moment the curious
        name which the orator had shouted was taken up by the whole assembly
        and repeated by them again and again. This scene in its turn lasted a
        long time, but ceased suddenly with the setting of the moon. The
        French traveller who witnessed it fell asleep, and when he awoke all
        was calm once more: there was nothing to recall the infernal dances
        of the night. a id="noteref_395" name="noteref_395" href=

            The presentation of infants to the

        American Indians, pay a superstitious respect to the moon. We may
        suppose that the ceremonious presentation of the infants to the moon
        was intended to ensure their life and growth. The names solemnly
        chanted by the whole assembly were probably those which the parents
        publicly bestowed on their children. As to the scarlet dancer who
        leaped across the fire, we may conjecture that he personated the
        moon, and that his strange antics in front of the women were designed
        to impart to them the fertilizing virtue of the luminary, and perhaps
        to facilitate their delivery.

        Among the Baganda
        of Central Africa there is general rejoicing when the new moon
        appears, and no work is done for seven days. When the crescent is
        first visible at evening, mothers take out their babies and hold them
        at arms' length, saying, “I want my child to
        keep in health till the moon wanes.” At the same time a
        ceremony is performed which may be intended to ensure the king's life
        and health throughout the ensuing month. It is a custom with the
        Baganda to preserve the king's navel-string with great care during
        his life. The precious object is called the  span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Twin” of the king, as if it were his double; and
        the ghost of the royal afterbirth is believed to be attached to it.
        Enclosed in a pot, which is wrapt in bark cloths, the navel-string is
        kept in a temple specially built for it near the king's enclosure,
        and a great minister of state acts as its guardian and priest. Every
        new moon, at evening, he carries it in state, wrapped in bark cloths,
        to the king, who takes it into his hands, examines it, and returns it
        to the minister. The keeper of the navel-string then goes back with
        it to the house and sets it in the doorway, where it remains all
        night. Next morning it is taken from its wrappings and again placed
        in the doorway until the evening, when it is once more swathed in
        bark cloths and restored to its usual place. a id="noteref_396" name=

        Apparently the navel-string is conceived as a vital portion, a sort
        of external soul, of the [pg

        king; and the attentions bestowed on it at the new moon may be
        supposed to refresh and invigorate it, thereby refreshing and
        invigorating the king's life.

        

        
          
            Baleful influence supposed to be
            exercised by the moon on children.
          
        

        The Armenians
        appear to think that the moon exercises a baleful influence on little
        children. To avert that influence a mother will show the moon to her
        child and say, “Thine uncle, thine
        uncle.” For the same purpose the father and mother will mount
        to the roof of the house at new moon on a Wednesday or Friday. The
        father then puts the child on a shovel and gives it to the mother,
        saying, “If it is thine, take it to thee. But
        if it is mine, rear it and give it to me back.” The mother
        then takes the child and the shovel, and returns them to the father
        in like manner. a id="noteref_397" name="noteref_397" href=

        would be easy to understand why the waning moon should be deemed
        injurious to children; they might be supposed to peak and pine with
        its dwindling light. Thus in Angus it is thought that if a child be
        weaned during the waning of the moon, it will decay all the time that
        the moon continues to wane. a id="noteref_400" name="noteref_400"

            Use of the moon to increase money or
            decrease sickness.
          
        

        There are many
        other ways in which people have sought to turn lunar sympathy to
        practical account. Clearly the increase of the moon is the time to
        increase your goods, and the decrease of the moon is the time to
        diminish your ills. Acting on this imaginary law of nature many
        persons in Europe show their money to the new moon or turn it in
        [pg 149] a name="Pg149"
        id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"> their pockets at that season,
        in the belief that the money will grow with the growth of the planet;
        sometimes, by way of additional precaution, they spit on the coin at
        the same time. a id="noteref_401" name="noteref_401" href=

        “Both Christians and Moslems in Syria turn
        their silver money in their pockets at the new moon for luck; and two
        persons meeting under the new moon will each take out a silver coin
        and embrace, saying, ‘May you begin and end;

        Conversely the waning of the moon is the most natural time to get rid
        of bodily ailments. In Brittany they think that warts vary with the
        phases of the moon, growing as it waxes and vanishing away as it
        wanes. a id="noteref_403" name="noteref_403" href=

        Accordingly, they say in Germany that if you would rid yourself of
        warts you should treat them when the moon is on the decrease. a id=

        German cure for toothache, earache, headache, and so forth, is to

        However, some Germans reverse the rule. They say, for example, that
        if you are afflicted with a wen, you should face the waxing moon, lay
        your finger on the wen, and say thrice, “What
        I see waxes; what I touch, let it vanish away.” After each of
        these two sentences you should cross yourself thrice. Then go home
        without speaking to any one, and repeat three paternosters behind the

        then either died a violent death in the divine character or had to
        redeem their life in one way or another, whether by performing a

            The Sed festival celebrated in Egypt
            at intervals of thirty years.
          
        

        A great festival
        called the Sed was celebrated by the Egyptians with much solemnity at
        intervals of thirty years. Various portions of the ritual are
        represented on the ancient monuments of Hieraconpolis and Abydos and
        in the oldest decorated temple of Egypt known to us, that of Usirniri
        at Busiris, which dates from the fifth dynasty. It appears that the
        ceremonies were as old as the Egyptian civilization, and that they
        continued to be observed till the end of the Roman period. a id=

        class="tei tei-anchor"> years is uncertain, but we can hardly
        doubt that the period was determined by astronomical considerations.
        According to one view, it was based on the observation of Saturn's
        period of revolution round the sun, which is, roughly speaking,
        thirty years, or, more exactly, twenty-nine years and one hundred and
        seventy-four days. a id="noteref_411" name="noteref_411" href=
        "#note_411"> span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">411
        According to another view, the thirty years' period had reference to
        Sirius, the star of Isis. We have seen that on account of the vague
        character of the old Egyptian year the heliacal rising of Sirius
        shifted its place gradually through every month of the
        calendar. a id="noteref_412" name="noteref_412" href=
        "#note_412"> span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">412 In one
        hundred and twenty years the star thus passed through one whole month
        of thirty days. To speak more precisely, it rose on the first of the
        month during the first four years of the period: it rose on the
        second of the month in the second four years, on the third of the
        month in the third four years; and so on successively, till in the
        last four years of the hundred and twenty years it rose on the last
        day of the month. As the Egyptians watched the annual summer rising
        of the star with attention and associated it with the most popular of
        their goddesses, it would be natural that its passage from one month
        to another, at intervals of one hundred and twenty years, should be
        the occasion of a great festival, and that the long period of one
        hundred and twenty years should be divided into four minor periods of
        thirty years respectively, each celebrated by a minor festival. a id=

        of the star's journey through the twelve  span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            Intention of the Sed festival to
            renew the king's life.
          
        

        However, we are
        here concerned rather with the meaning and the rites of the festival
        than with the reasons for holding it once every thirty years. The
        intention of the festival seems to have been to procure for the king
        a new lease of life, a renovation of his divine energies, a
        rejuvenescence. In the inscriptions of Abydos we read, after an
        account of the rites, the following address to the king:  span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Thou dost recommence thy renewal, thou art granted to
        flourish again like the infant god Moon, thou dost grow young again,
        and that from season to season, like Nun at the beginning of time,
        thou art born again in renewing the Sed festivals. All life comes to
        thy nostril, and thou art king of the whole earth for
        ever.” a id="noteref_415" name="noteref_415" href=
        "#note_415"> span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">415 In
        short, on these occasions it appears to have been supposed that the
        king was in a manner born again.

        

        
          
            The king identified with the dead
            Osiris at the Sed festival.
          
        

        But how was the
        new birth effected? Apparently the essence of the rites consisted in
        identifying the king with Osiris; for just as Osiris had died and
        risen again from the dead, so the king might be thought to die and to
        live again with the god whom he personated. The ceremony would thus
        be for the king a death as well as a rebirth. Accordingly in pictures
        of the Sed festival on the monuments we see the king posing as the
        dead Osiris. He sits in a shrine like a god, holding in his hands the
        crook and flail of Osiris: he is wrapped in tight bandages like the
        mummified Osiris; indeed, there is nothing but his name to prove that
        he is not Osiris himself. This enthronement of the king in the
        attitude of the dead god seems to have been the principal event of
        the festival. a id="noteref_416" name="noteref_416" href=

        representation of the scene, appears to be the royal child. An
        enclosure of curtains hung on poles surrounds the dancing-ground,

            Professor Flinders Petrie's
            explanation of the Sed festival.
          
        

        According to
        Professor Flinders Petrie, “the conclusion
        may be drawn thus. In the savage age of prehistoric times, the
        Egyptians, like many other African and Indian peoples, killed their
        priest-king at stated intervals, in order that the ruler should, with
        unimpaired life and health, be enabled to maintain the kingdom in its
        highest condition. The royal daughters were present in order that
        they might be married to his successor. The jackal-god went before
        [pg 155] a name="Pg155"
        id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"> him, to open the way to the
        unseen world; and the ostrich feather received and bore away the
        king's soul in the breeze that blew it out of sight. This was the
        celebration of the ‘end,’ the
         span style=
        "font-style: italic">sed feast. The king thus became
        the dead king, patron of all those who had died in his reign, who
        were his subjects here and hereafter. He was thus one with Osiris,
        the king of the dead. This fierce custom became changed, as in other
        lands, by appointing a deputy king to die in his stead; which idea
        survived in the Coptic Abu Nerūs, with his tall crown of Upper Egypt,
        false beard, and sceptre. After the death of the deputy, the real
        king renewed his life and reign. Henceforward this became the
        greatest of the royal festivals, the apotheosis of the king during
        his life, after which he became Osiris upon earth and the patron of

            Alexandre Moret's theory that at the
            Sed festivals the king was supposed to die and to be born
            again.
          
        

        A similar theory
        of the Sed festival is maintained by another eminent Egyptologist, M.
        Alexandre Moret. He says: “In most of the
        temples of Egypt, of all periods, pictures set forth for us the
        principal scenes of a solemn festival called  span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘festival of the tail,’ the Sed festival. It
        consisted essentially in a representation of the ritual death of the
        king followed by his rebirth. In this case the king is identified
        with Osiris, the god who in historical times is the hero of the
        sacred drama of humanity, he who guides us through the three stages
        of life, death, and rebirth in the other world. Hence, clad in the
        funeral costume of Osiris, with the tight-fitting garment clinging to
        him like a shroud, Pharaoh is conducted to the tomb; and from it he
        returns rejuvenated and reborn like Osiris emerging from the dead.
        How was this fiction carried out? how was this miracle performed? By
        the sacrifice of human or animal victims. On behalf of the king a
        priest lay down in the skin of the animal victim: he assumed the
        posture characteristic of an embryo in its mother's womb: when he
        came forth from the skin he was deemed to be reborn; and Pharaoh, for
        whom this rite was celebrated, was himself reborn, or to adopt the
        Egyptian expression, [pg
        156]
        ‘he renewed his births.’ And in
        testimony of the due performance of the rites the king girt his loins
        with the tail, a compendious representative of the skin of the
        sacrificed beast, whence the name of ‘the
        festival of the tail.’

         span class=
        "tei tei-q">“How are we to explain the rule that at a certain point
        of his reign every Pharaoh must undergo this ritual death followed by
        fictitious rebirth? Is it simply a renewal of the initiation into the
        Osirian mysteries? or does the festival present some more special
        features? The ill-defined part played by the royal children in these
        rites seems to me to indicate that the Sed festival represents other
        episodes which refer to the transmission of the regal office. At the
        dawn of civilization in Egypt the people were perhaps familiar with
        the alternative either of putting their king to death in his full
        vigour in order that his power should be transmitted intact to his
        successor, or of attempting to rejuvenate him and to  span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘renew his life.’ The latter measure was an
        invention of the Pharaohs. How could it be carried out more
        effectively than by identifying themselves with Osiris, by applying
        to themselves the process of resurrection, the funeral rites by which
        Isis, according to the priests, had magically saved her husband from
        death? Perhaps the fictitious death of the king may be regarded as a
        mitigation of the primitive murder of the divine king, a transition
        from a barbarous reality to symbolism.” a id="noteref_424"

        Chapter XI. The Origin of
        Osiris.

        

        
          
            How did the conception of Osiris as
            a god of vegetation and of the dead originate?
          
        

        Thus far we have
        discussed the character of Osiris as he is presented to us in the art
        and literature of Egypt and in the testimonies of Greek writers; and
        we have found that judged by these indications he was in the main a
        god of vegetation and of the dead. But we have still to ask, how did
        the conception of such a composite deity originate? Did it arise
        simply through observation of the great annual fluctuations of the
        seasons and a desire to explain them? Was it a result of brooding
        over the mystery of external nature? Was it the attempt of a rude
        philosophy to lift the veil and explore the hidden springs that set
        the vast machine in motion? That man at a very early stage of his
        long history meditated on these things and evolved certain crude
        theories which partially satisfied his craving after knowledge is
        certain; from such meditations of Babylonian and Phrygian sages
        appear to have sprung the pathetic figures of Adonis and Attis; and
        from such meditations of Egyptian sages may have sprung the tragic
        figure of Osiris.

        

        
          
            While Adonis and Attis were
            subordinate figures in their respective pantheons, Osiris was the
            greatest and most popular god of Egypt.
          
        

        Yet a broad
        distinction seems to sever the myth and worship of Osiris from the
        kindred myths and worships of Adonis and Attis. For while Adonis and
        Attis were minor divinities in the religion of Western Asia,
        completely overshadowed by the greater deities of their respective
        pantheons, the solemn figure of Osiris towered in solitary grandeur
        over all the welter of Egyptian gods, like a pyramid of his native
        land lit up by the last rays of the setting sun when all below it is
        in shadow. And whereas legend generally represented Adonis and Attis
        as simple swains, mere herdsmen  span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page159">[pg 159] a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"> or hunters whom the fatal love of a goddess had
        elevated above their homely sphere into a brief and melancholy
        pre-eminence, Osiris uniformly appears in tradition as a great and
        beneficent king. In life, he ruled over his people, beloved and
        revered for the benefits he conferred on them and on the world; in
        death he reigned in their hearts and memories as lord of the dead,
        the awful judge at whose bar every man must one day stand to give an
        account of the deeds done in the body and to receive the final award.
        In the faith of the Egyptians the cruel death and blessed
        resurrection of Osiris occupied the same place as the death and
        resurrection of Christ hold in the faith of Christians. As Osiris
        died and rose again from the dead, so they hoped through him and in
        his dear name to wake triumphant from the sleep of death to a
        blissful eternity. That was their sheet-anchor in life's stormy sea;
        that was the hope which supported and consoled millions of Egyptian
        men and women for a period of time far longer than that during which
        Christianity has now existed on earth. In the long history of
        religion no two divine figures resemble each other more closely in
        the fervour of personal devotion which they have kindled and in the
        high hopes which they have inspired than Osiris and Christ. The sad
        figure of Buddha indeed has been as deeply loved and revered by
        countless millions; but he had no glad tidings of immortality for
        men, nothing but the promise of a final release from the burden of
        mortality.

        

        
          
            The personal devotion of the
            Egyptians to Osiris suggests that he may have been a real man;
            for all the permanent religious or semi-religious systems of the
            world have been founded by individual great men.
          
        

        And if Osiris and
        Christ have been the centres of the like enthusiastic devotion, may
        not the secret of their influence have been similar? If Christ lived
        the life and died the death of a man on earth, may not Osiris have
        done so likewise? The immense and enduring popularity of his worship
        speaks in favour of the supposition; for all the other great
        religious or semi-religious systems which have won for themselves a
        permanent place in the affections of mankind, have been founded by
        individual great men, who by their personal life and example exerted
        a power of attraction such as no cold abstractions, no pale products
        of the collective wisdom or folly could ever exert on the minds and
        hearts of humanity. Thus it was with Buddhism, with  span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160] a name="Pg160" id="Pg160"
        class="tei tei-anchor"> Confucianism, with Christianity, and with
        Mohammedanism; and thus it may well have been with the religion of
        Osiris. Certainly we shall do less violence to the evidence if we
        accept the unanimous tradition of ancient Egypt on this point than if
        we resolve the figure of Osiris into a myth pure and simple. And when
        we consider that from the earliest to the latest times Egyptian kings
        were worshipped as gods both in life and in death, there appears to
        be nothing extravagant or improbable in the view that one of them by
        his personal qualities excited a larger measure of devotion than
        usual during his life and was remembered with fonder affection and
        deeper reverence after his death; till in time his beloved memory,
        dimmed, transfigured, and encircled with a halo of glory by the mists
        of time, grew into the dominant religion of his people. At least this
        theory is reasonable enough to deserve a serious consideration. If we
        accept it, we may suppose that the mythical elements, which legend
        undoubtedly ascribed to Osiris, were later accretions which gathered
        about his memory like ivy about a ruin. There is no improbability in
        such a supposition; on the contrary, all analogy is in its favour,
        for nothing is more certain than that myths grow like weeds round the
        great historical figures of the past.

        

        
          
            The historical reality of Osiris as
            an old king of Egypt can be supported by modern African
            analogies.
          
        

        In recent years
        the historical reality of Osiris as a king who once lived and reigned
        in Egypt has been maintained by more than one learned scholar; a id=

        without venturing to pronounce a decided opinion on so obscure and
        difficult a question, I think it worth while, following the example
        of Dr. Wallis Budge, to indicate certain modern African analogies
        which tend to confirm the view that beneath the mythical wrappings of
        Osiris there lay the mummy of a dead man. At all events the analogies
        which I shall cite suffice to prove that the custom of worshipping
        dead kings has not been confined to Egypt, but has been apparently
        widespread throughout Africa, though the evidence now at our disposal
        only enables us to detect the observance of the  span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161] a name="Pg161" id="Pg161"
        class="tei tei-anchor"> custom at a few points of the great
        continent. But even if the resemblance in this respect between
        ancient Egypt and modern Africa should be regarded as established, it
        would not justify us in inferring an ethnical affinity between the
        fair or ruddy Egyptians and the black aboriginal races who occupy
        almost the whole of Africa except a comparatively narrow fringe on
        the northern sea-board. Scholars are still divided on the question of
        the original home and racial relationship of the ancient Egyptians.
        It has been held on the one hand that they belong to an indigenous
        white race which has been always in possession of the Mediterranean
        coasts of Africa; and on the other hand it has been supposed that
        they are akin to the Semites in blood as well as in language, and
        that they entered Africa from the East, whether by gradual
        infiltration or on a sudden wave of conquest like the Arabs in the
        decline of the Roman empire. a id="noteref_426" name="noteref_426"

        marriage between the two races, it seems unsafe to assume that the
        religious and political resemblances which can be traced between them
        are based on any closer relationship than the general similarity in
        structure and functions of the human mind.

        of this work we saw that the Shilluks, a pastoral and partially

        [pg 162] a name="Pg162"

        interred at the village where he was born and where his afterbirth is
        buried, these grave-shrines are scattered over the country. Each of
        them usually comprises a small group of round huts, resembling the
        common houses of the people, the whole being enclosed by a fence; one
        of the huts is built over the grave, the others are occupied by the
        guardians of the shrine, who at first are generally the widows or old
        men-servants of the deceased king. When these women or retainers die,
        they are succeeded in office by their descendants, for the tombs are
        maintained in perpetuity, so that the number of temples and of gods
        is always on the increase. Cattle are dedicated to these royal
        shrines and animals sacrificed at them. For example, when the millet
        crop threatens to fail or a murrain breaks out among the beasts, one
        of the dead kings will appear to somebody in a dream and demand a
        sacrifice. The dream is reported to the king, and he immediately
        orders a bullock and a cow to be sent to the grave of the dead king
        who appeared in a vision of the night to the sleeper. This is done;
        the bullock is killed and the cow added to the sacred herd of the
        shrine. It is customary, also, though not necessary, at harvest to
        offer some of the new millet at the temple-tombs of the kings; and
        sick people send animals to be sacrificed there on their behalf.
        Special regard is paid to trees that grow near the graves of the
        kings; and the spirits of the departed monarchs are believed to
        appear from time to time in the form of certain animals. One of them,
        for example, always takes the shape of a certain insect, which seems
        to be the larva of the  span style=
        "font-style: italic">Mantidae. When a Shilluk finds one
        of these insects, he will take it up in his hands and deposit it
        reverentially at the shrine. Other kings manifest themselves as a
        certain species of white birds; others assume the form of giraffes.
        When one of these long-legged and long-necked creatures comes
        stalking up fearlessly to a village where there is a king's grave,
        the people know that the king's soul is in the animal, and the
        attendants at the royal tomb testify their joy at the appearance of
        their master by sacrificing a sheep or even a bullock.

        it would have been under conditions such as now prevail in Europe;
        for down to the time when their country came under British rule it
        was the regular custom of the Shilluks to put their kings to death as
        soon as they showed serious symptoms of bodily or mental decay. The
        custom was based on “the conviction that the
        king must not be allowed to become ill or senile, lest with his
        diminishing vigour the cattle should sicken and fail to bear their
        increase, the crops should rot in the fields, and man, stricken with

        the wind. When a missionary asked the Shilluks as to the manner of
        Nyakang's death, they were filled with amazement at his ignorance and

        historical personage; he led the Shilluks to the land which they now
        occupy; he helped them to victory, made them great and warlike,
        regulated marriage and law, distributed the country among them,
        divided it into districts, and in order to increase the dependence of
        the people on him and to show them his power, became their greatest
        benefactor by giving himself out as the bestower of

        god Juok, the creator, who, having ordered the world, committed it to

        in a few conventional forms of salutation at meeting and parting like
        our “Good-bye.” Far otherwise is it
        with Nyakang. He “is the ancestor of the
        Shilluk nation and the founder of the Shilluk dynasty. He is
        worshipped, sacrifices and prayers are offered to him; he may be said
        to be lifted to the rank of a demi-god, though they never forget that
        he has been a real man. He is expressly designated as  span class=

        “in the political, religious and personal

        the national hero, of whom each Shilluk feels proud, who is praised
        in innumerable popular songs and sayings; he is not only a superior
        being, but also a man. He is the sublime model for every true
        Shilluk; everything they value most in their national and private
        life has its origin in him: their kingdom and their fighting as well
        as cattle-breeding and farming. While Nyakang is their good father,
        who only does them good, Juok is the great, uncontrollable power,

            The belief in the former humanity of
            Nyakang is confirmed by the analogy of his worship to that of the
            dead Shilluk kings.
          
        

        The universal
        belief of the Shilluks in the former humanity of Nyakang is strongly
        confirmed by the exact parallelism which prevails between his worship
        and that of the dead kings his successors. Like them he is worshipped
        at his tomb; but unlike them he has not one tomb only, but ten
        scattered over the country. Each of these tombs is called
        “the grave of Nyakang,” though the
        people well know that nobody is buried there. Like the grave-shrines
        of the other kings, those of Nyakang consist of a small group of
        circular huts of the ordinary pattern enclosed by a fence. Only
        children under puberty and the few old people whose duty it is to
        take care of the shrines may enter these sacred enclosures. The rites
        performed at them resemble those observed at the shrines of the
        kings. Two great ceremonies are annually performed at the shrines of
        Nyakang: one is observed before the beginning of the rainy season in
        order to ensure a due supply of rain; the other is a thanksgiving at
        harvest, when porridge made from the new grain is poured out on the
        threshold of Nyakang's hut and smeared on the outer walls of the
        building. Even before the millet is reaped the people cut some of the
        ripening ears and thrust them into the thatch of the sacred hut. Thus
        it would seem that the Shilluks believe themselves to be dependent on
        the favour of Nyakang for the rain and the crops.  span class=
        "tei tei-q">“As the giver of rain, Nyakang is the first and greatest
        benefactor of the people. In that country rain is everything, without
        rain there is nothing. The Shilluk does not trouble his head about
        artificial irrigation, he waits for the rain. If the rain falls, then
        the millet grows, the cows thrive, man has food and can dance and
        marry; for that is the ideal of the Shilluks.” a id=

            Comparison of Nyakang with
            Osiris.
          
        

        The example of
        Nyakang seems to show that under favourable circumstances the worship
        of a dead king may develop into the dominant religion of a people.
        There is, therefore, no intrinsic improbability in the view that in
        ancient Egypt the religion of Osiris originated in that way.
        Certainly some curious resemblances can be traced between the dead
        Nyakang and the dead Osiris. Both died violent and mysterious deaths:
        the graves of both were pointed out in many parts of the country:
        both were deemed the great sources of fertility for the whole land:
        and both were associated with certain sacred trees and animals,
        particularly with bulls. And just as Egyptian kings identified
        themselves both in life and in death with their deified predecessor
        Osiris, so Shilluk kings are still believed to be animated by the
        spirit of their deified predecessor Nyakang and to share his
        divinity.

        

        
          
            The spirits of dead kings worshipped
            by the Baganda of Central Africa.
          
        

        Another African
        people who regularly worship, or rather used to worship, the spirits
        of their dead kings are the Baganda. Their country Uganda lies at the
        very source of the Nile, where the great river issues from Lake
        Victoria Nyanza. Among them the ghosts of dead kings were placed on
        an equality with the gods and received the same honour and worship;
        they foretold events which concerned the State, and they advised the
        living king, warning him when war was likely to break out. The king
        consulted them periodically, visiting first one and then another of
        the temples in which the mortal remains of his predecessors were
        preserved with religious care. But the temple ( span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"> span style=
        "font-style: italic">malolo) of a king contained only
        his lower jawbone and his navel-string ( span class=

        curiously enough the Baganda believed that the part of the body to

        ghost, in the opinion of these people, will follow it, even to the
        ends of the earth, and will be perfectly content to remain with it so

        navel-string, in a temple specially dedicated to the worship of the
        king's ghost; for it is believed that the ghosts of the deceased
        monarchs would quarrel if they shared the same temple, the question

        When a king dies,
        his body is sent to Busiro and there embalmed. Then it is laid to
        rest in a large round house, which has been built for its reception
        on the top of a hill. This is the king's tomb. It is a conical
        structure supported by a central post, with a thatched roof reaching
        down to the ground. Round the hut a high strong fence of reeds is
        erected, and an outer fence encircles the whole at some distance
        lower down the hill. Here the body is placed on a bedstead; the
        sepulchral chamber is filled with bark cloths till it can hold no
        more, the mainpost is cut down, and the door of the tomb closed, so
        that no one can enter it again. When that was done, the wives of the
        late king used to be brought, with their arms pinioned, and placed at
        intervals round the outer wall of the tomb, where they were clubbed
        to death. Hundreds of men were also killed in the space between the
        two fences, that their ghosts might wait on the ghost of the dead
        king in the other world. None of their bodies were buried; they were
        left to rot where they fell. Then the gates in the fences were
        closed; and three chiefs [pg
        169]
        with their men guarded the dead bodies from the wild beasts and the
        vultures. But the hut in which the king's body reposed was never
        repaired; it was allowed to moulder and fall into decay. a id=

            navel-strings, which are accordingly preserved in temples
            dedicated to the worship of the kings.
          
        

        Five months later
        the jawbone of the royal corpse was removed in order to be fashioned
        into an effigy or representative of the dead king. For this purpose
        three chiefs entered the tomb, not through the door, but by cutting a
        hole through the wall, and having severed the head from the body they
        brought it out, carefully filling up the hole in the wall behind
        them, replacing the thatch, and securing the gates in the fence. When
        the jawbone had been removed by a chief of the Civet clan, the skull
        was sent back to Busiro and buried with honour near the mouldering
        tomb. In contrast to the neglect of the tomb where the royal body
        lay, the place where the skull was buried was kept in good repair and
        guarded by some of the old princesses and widows. As for the jawbone,
        it was put in an ant-hill and left there till the ants had eaten away
        all the flesh. Then, after it had been washed in beer and milk, it
        was decorated with cowry-shells and placed in a wooden vessel; this
        vessel was next wrapt in bark cloths till it assumed a conical shape,
        about two and a half feet high by a foot and a half broad at the
        base. This conical packet, decorated on the outside with beads, was
        treated as an image of the deceased king or rather as if it were the
        king himself in life, for it was called simply  span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The King.” Beside it was placed the stump of the
        king's navel-string, similarly wrapt in bark cloths and decorated,
        though not made up into a conical shape. a id="noteref_445" name=

        "tei tei-noteref"> span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">445 The
        reason for preserving both the jawbone and the navel-string was that
        the ghost of the king was supposed to attach itself to his jawbone,
        and the ghost of his double to his navel-string. For in the belief of
        the Baganda every person has a double, namely, the afterbirth or
        placenta, which is born immediately after him and is regarded by the
        [pg 170] a name="Pg170"
        id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"> people as a second child. Now
        that double has a ghost of its own, which adheres to the
        navel-string; and if the person is to remain healthy, it is essential
        that the ghost of his double should be carefully preserved. Hence
        every Baganda man and woman keeps his or her navel-string wrapt up in
        bark cloth as a treasure of great price on which his health and
        prosperity are dependent; the precious little bundle is called his
        Twin ( span style=
        "font-style: italic">mulongo), because it contains the
        ghost of his double, the afterbirth. If that is deemed necessary for
        everybody, much more is it deemed essential for the welfare of the
        king; hence during his life the stump of his navel-string is kept, as
        we saw, a id="noteref_446" name="noteref_446" href=

        ghost of his double should be kept together in the same place; that
        is why the jawbone and the navel-string of every dead king are
        carefully preserved in the same temple, because the two ghosts adhere

        The two ghosts
        having been thus safely lodged in the two precious parcels, the next
        thing was to install them in the temple, where they were to enter on
        their career of beneficent activity. A site having been chosen, the
        whole country supplied the labour necessary for building the temple;
        and ministers were appointed to wait upon the dead king. The officers
        of state who had held important posts during his life retained their
        titles and continued to discharge their duties towards their old
        master in death. Accordingly houses were built for them near the
        temple. The dowager queen also took up her residence at the entrance
        to the temple enclosure, and became its principal guardian. Many also
        of the king's widows of lower rank were drafted off to live inside
        the enclosure and keep watch over it. When the queen or any of these
        widows died, her place was supplied by another princess or a
        [pg 171] a name="Pg171"
        id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"> woman of the same clan; for
        the temple was maintained in perpetuity. However, when the reigning

        The temple
        consecrated to the worship of a king regularly stood on a hill. The
        site was generally chosen by the king in his life, but sometimes his
        choice was set aside by his successor, who gave orders to build the
        temple in another place. a id="noteref_450" name="noteref_450" href=

        structure was a large conical or bee-hive-shaped hut of the ordinary
        pattern, divided internally into two chambers, an outer and an inner.
        Any person might enter the outer chamber, but the inner was sacred
        and no profane person might set foot in it; for there the holy relics
        of the dead king, his jawbone and his navel-string, were kept for
        safety in a cell dug in the floor, and there, in close attendance on
        them, the king's ghost was believed to dwell. In front of the
        partition which screened this Holy of Holies from the gaze of the
        multitude there stood a throne, covered with lion and leopard skins
        and fenced off from the rest of the sacred edifice by a glittering

        supporting the roof, formed a series of aisles in perfect line, and

        Sometimes the dead king spoke to the congregation by the voice of his
        prophet. That was a great event. When the oracle was about to be
        given to the expectant throng, the prophet stepped up to the throne,
        and addressing the spirit informed him of the business in hand. Then
        he smoked one or two pipes, and the fumes bringing on the prophetic
        fit, he began to rave and to speak in the very voice and with the
        characteristic turns of speech of the departed monarch, for the
        king's spirit was now in him. This message from the world beyond the
        grave was naturally received with rapt attention. Gradually the fit
        of inspiration passed: the voice of the prophet resumed its natural
        tones: the spirit had departed from him and returned to its abode in
        the inner room. Such a solemn audience used to be announced
        beforehand by the beating of the drums in the early morning, and the
        worshippers brought with them to the temple offerings of food for the
        dead king, as if he were still alive. a id="noteref_451" name=

        But the greatest
        day of all was when the reigning king visited the temple of his
        father. This he did as a rule only once during his reign. Nor did the
        people approve of the visits being repeated, for each visit was the
        signal for the death of many. Yet, attracted by a painful curiosity,
        crowds assembled, followed the monarch to the temple, and thronged to
        see the great ceremony of the meeting between the king and the ghost
        of his royal father. The sacred relics were displayed: an old man
        explained them to the monarch and placed them in his hands: the
        prophet, inspired by the dead king's spirit, revealed to the living
        king his destiny. The interview over, the king was carried back to
        his house. It was on the return journey that he always gave, suddenly
        and without warning, the signal of death. Obedient to his

        though the king rarely visited his father's ghost at the temple, he
        had a private chapel for the ghost within the vast enclosure of the
        royal residence; and here he often paid his devotions to the august
        spirit, of whom he stood greatly in awe. He took his wives with him
        to sing the departed monarch's praise, and he constantly made
        offerings at the shrine. Thither, too, would come the prophet to suck
        words of wisdom from the venerable ghost and to impart them to the
        king, who thus walked in the counsel of his glorified father. a id=

            The souls of dead kings worshipped
            in Kiziba.
          
        

        In Kiziba, a
        district of Central Africa on the western side of Lake Victoria
        Nyanza, the souls of dead kings become ruling spirits; temples are
        built in their honour and priests appointed to serve them. The people
        are composed of two different races, the Bairu, who are aboriginals,
        and the Bahima, who are immigrants from the north. The royal family
        belongs to the Bahima stock. In his lifetime the king's person is
        sacred; and all his actions, property, and so forth are described by
        special terms appropriated to that purpose. The people are divided
        into totemic clans: the totems ( span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"> span style=
        "font-style: italic">muziro) are mostly animals or
        parts of animals: no man may kill or eat his totem animal, nor marry
        a woman who has the same totem as himself. The royal family seems to
        have serpents for their totem; after death the king's soul lives in a
        serpent, while his body is buried in the hut where he died. The
        people revere a supreme god named Rugaba, who is believed to have
        created man and cattle; but they know little about him, and though
        they [pg 174] a name=

        him, particularly in the case of a difficult birth, he has no priests
        and receives no sacrifices. The business of the priests is to act as
        intermediaries, not between God and man, but between men and the
        spirits. The spirits are believed to have been formerly kings of the
        world. The highest of them is a certain Wamara, who rules over the
        souls of the dead, and who would seem to have been a great king in
        his life. Temples are built for him; they are like the houses of men,
        but only half as large. A perpetual holy fire is kept up in each
        temple, and the priest passes the night in it. He receives white
        sheep or goats as victims, and generally acts also as a diviner or
        physician. When a man is very ill, he thinks that Wamara, the lord of
        the spirits of the dead, is summoning him to the far country; so he
        sends a sacrifice to Wamara's priest, who prays to the spirit to let
        the sick man live yet a while. a id="noteref_454" name="noteref_454"

            The worship of ancestral spirits
            among the Bantu tribes of Northern Rhodesia.
          
        

        The Bantu tribes
        who inhabit the great tableland of Northern Rhodesia revere a supreme
        being whom they call Leza, but their ideas about him are hazy.
        Thunder, lightning, earthquakes, rain, and other natural phenomena
        are grouped together under his name as manifestations of his power.
        Among the more progressive tribes, such as the Awemba and the Wabisa,
        the great god is thought to take some interest in human affairs; and
        though they do not pray to him, they nevertheless invoke him by his
        names of praise, which set forth his attributes as the protector and
        judge of mankind. It is he, too, who receives the souls of the
        departed. “Yet, as far as the dominant Wemba
        tribe is concerned, the cult of Leza is outside their ordinary
        religion. There is no direct access to him by prayer or by
        sacrifices, which are made to Mulenga and the other great
        [pg 175] a name="Pg175"
        id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"> tribal and ancestral spirits

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">455 The
        ancestral spirits whom the Awemba and all other tribes of this region
        worship may be divided into two main classes. First come the spirits
        of departed chiefs, who are publicly worshipped by the whole tribe;
        and second come the spirits of near relations who are worshipped
        privately by each head of a family. a id="noteref_456" name=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">456
        “Among the Awemba there is no special shrine
        for these purely family spirits, who are worshipped inside the hut,
        and to whom family sacrifice of a sheep, a goat, or a fowl is made,
        the spirit receiving the blood spilt on the ground, while all the
        members of the family partake of the flesh together. For a religious
        Wemba man the cult of the spirit of his nearest relations (of his
        grandparents, or of his deceased father, mother, elder brother, or
        maternal uncle) is considered quite sufficient. Out of these spirit
        relatives a man will worship one whom he considers as his special
        familiar, for various reasons. For instance, the diviner may have
        told him that his last illness was caused because he had not
        respected the spirit of his uncle; accordingly he will be careful in
        future to adopt his uncle as his tutelary spirit. As a mark of such
        respect he may devote a cow or a goat to one of the spirits of his
        ancestors. Holding the fowl, for instance, in his hands, he will
        dedicate it, asking the spirit to come and abide in it, upon which
        the fowl is let go, and is afterwards called by the name of the
        spirit. If the necessities, however, of the larder demand that it
        should be killed, another animal is taken, and the spirit is asked to
        accept it as a substitute! Before beginning any special task, such as
        hoeing a new garden, or going on a journey, Wemba men invoke their
        tutelary spirits to be with them and to assist their efforts, in
        short ejaculatory prayers usually couched in a set formula. Among
        many of the tribes in the North Luangwa district longer formal
        prayers are still made to all the deceased ancestors of the clan at
        the time of harvest, asking them to protect the crops and to drive
        away illnesses and evil spirits from  span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            The worship of ancestral spirits is
            apparently the main practical religion of all the Bantu
            tribes.
          
        

        Thus among these
        tribes, who all belong to the great Bantu family, the public worship
        which a whole tribe pays to the souls of its dead chiefs is probably
        nothing but an extension of the private worship which every family
        pays privately to the souls of its dead members. And just as the
        members of his family whom a man worships privately are not mythical
        beings conjured up by imagination out of a distant past, but were
        once real men like himself whom he knew in life, it may be his
        father, or uncle, or elder brother, so we may be sure that in like
        manner the dead chiefs revered by the whole tribe are not creations
        of the mythical fancy, but were once real men of flesh and blood, who
        ruled over the tribe, and whose memory has been more or less
        faithfully preserved by tradition. In this respect the tribes of
        Northern Rhodesia are typical of all the tribes of that great Bantu
        family which occupies nearly the whole southern half of Africa, from
        the great equatorial lakes to the Cape of Good Hope. The main
        practical religion of all these numerous and widespread peoples
        appears to be the worship of their ancestors.

        

        
          
            The worship of ancestral spirits
            among the Bantu tribes of South Africa.
          
        

        To adduce in full
        the evidence which points to this conclusion would lead us too far
        from our present subject; it must suffice to cite a few typical
        statements of competent authorities which refer to different tribes
        of the Bantu stock. Speaking with special reference to the tribes of
        South-Eastern Africa, the Rev. James Macdonald tells us that
        “the religion of the Bantu, which they not
        only profess but really regulate their conduct by, is based on the
        belief that the spirits of their ancestors interfere constantly in
        their affairs. Every man worships his own ancestors and offers
        sacrifices to avert their wrath. The clan worships the spirits of the
        ancestors of its chiefs, and the tribe worships the spirits of the
        ancestors of the paramount chief.” a id="noteref_458" name=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">458
        “The religion of the Bantu was based upon the
        supposition of the [pg
        177]
        existence of spirits that could interfere with the affairs of this
        world. These spirits were those of their ancestors and their deceased
        chiefs, the greatest of whom had control over lightning. When the
        spirits became offended or hungry they sent a plague or disaster
        until sacrifices were offered and their wrath or hunger was appeased.
        The head of a family of commoners on such an occasion killed an
        animal, and all ate of the meat, as the hungry ghost was supposed to
        be satisfied with the smell.” a id="noteref_459" name=

        example, in the year 1891 the son of a chief of the Pondomisi tribe
        was arrested for an assault and sent for trial before a colonial
        court. It chanced to be a season of intense heat and severe drought,
        and the Pondomisi tribe attributed these calamities to the wrath of a
        dead chief named Gwanya, very famous in his lifetime, whose body,
        fastened to a log, had been buried under a heap of stones in a deep
        pool of the Lina river. This redoubtable chieftain was the seventh
        ancestor in the direct line of the man who had committed the assault;
        and he warmly resented the indignity which the whites had done to a
        noble scion of his house by consigning him to durance vile. To
        appease the natural indignation of the ghost, the tribesmen killed
        cattle on the banks of the pool which contained his grave, and threw
        the flesh into the water along with new dishes full of beer. The
        prisoner, however, was convicted of the assault and sentenced by the
        ruthless magistrate, who was no respecter of ghosts, to pay a fine.
        But the tribe clubbed together and paid the fine for him; and a few
        days later rain fell in plenty. The mollified ghost had opened the
        celestial sluices. a id="noteref_460" name="noteref_460" href=

        "tei tei-q">“the ancestral spirits love the very things they loved
        before they passed through the flesh; they cherish the same desires
        and have the same antipathies. The living cannot add to the number of
        the wives of ancestral spirits; but they can kill cattle in their
        honour and keep their praise and memory alive on earth. Above all
        things, they can give them beef and beer. And if the living do not
        give them sufficient of these things the spirits are supposed to give
        the people a bad time: they send drought, and sickness, and famine,
        until people kill cattle in their honour. When men are alive they
        love to be praised and flattered, fed and attended to; after death
        they want the very same things, for death does not change
        personality.... In time of drought, or sickness, or great trouble,
        there would be great searchings of heart as to which ancestor had
        been neglected, for the trouble would be supposed to be caused by the
        neglected ancestor. Most of the people would get the subject on their
        nerves (at least, as far as a Kafir could get anything on the leather
        strings which do duty for nerves), and some one would be sure to have
        a vivid dream in which an ancestor would complain that the people had
        not praised him half enough of late. So an ox would be killed, either
        by the head-man of the kraal or by a diviner. Then the man would say
        over the ox as it was being killed, ‘Cry out,
        ox of So-and-So; listen to us, So-and-So; this is your ox; we praise
        you by all your laud-giving names, and tell of all your deeds; do not
        be angry with us any more; do you not see that this is your ox? Do
        not accuse us of neglecting you; when, forsooth, have we ceased to
        praise you and offer you meat and beer? Take note, then, that here is
        another ox we are offering to you.’ When the ox is dead some
        of the meat is mixed with herbs and medicines and placed in a hut
        with a bowlful of blood. This meat is placed in the part of the hut
        where the man loved to sit while he was alive, and some one is told
        off to guard the sacrifice. The meat is left for a night, or longer,
        and the spirits are supposed to come and enjoy the smell, or drink
        the serum which oozes from the meat, and to inhale the smell of the
        beer. The priest or diviner will then sprinkle the people and the
        huts with medicine made from the contents of the  span class=

        a sherd; when this is dry he burns it and calls on the spirits to
        smell the incense. After the meat has been left for a certain time it
        is taken out and cooked, and eaten by the men near the cattle kraal

        Motlumi, from whom their chiefs are descended. The Baharutsis and the
        Barolongs invoke Tobege and his wife Mampa. Mampa makes known the

        more accessible; hence this formula, which is often used:
        ‘New gods! entreat the ancient gods for
        us!’ In all countries spirits are more the objects of fear

        grant us great wealth, so that both we and our children may
        prosper.’ In the cattle-fold they talk a long time, praising

        all the fold. Again they take it, and strew it within the houses,

        grant us a blessing, beholding what we have done. You see this
        distress; may you remove it, since we have given you our animal. We
        know not what more you want, whether you still require anything more
        or not.’ They say, ‘May you grant us
        grain, that it may be abundant, that we may eat, of course, and not
        be in need of anything, since now we have given you what you
        want.’ They say, ‘Yes, for a long time

        by the ghosts that they may grant an abundant harvest again, that we
        may not have a famine.’ If one is on the point of being
        injured by anything, he says, ‘I was

        slaughters a goat in honour of the same, and puts the gall on his

         span class=

        the dead of their tribe. Speaking generally, the head of each house
        is worshipped by the children of that house; for they do not know the
        ancients who are dead, nor their laud-giving names, nor their names.
        But their father whom they knew is the head by whom they begin and
        end in their prayer, for they know him best, and his love for his
        children; they remember his kindness to them whilst he was living;
        they compare his treatment of them whilst he was living, support
        themselves by it, and say, ‘He will still
        treat us in the same way now he is dead. We do not know why he should
        regard others besides us; he will regard us only.’ So it is
        then although they worship the many Amatongo of their tribe, making a
        great fence around them for their protection; yet their father is far
        before all others when they worship the Amatongo. Their father is a
        great treasure to them even when he is dead. And those of his
        children who are already grown up know him thoroughly, his
        gentleness, and his bravery. And if there is illness in the village,
        the eldest son lauds him with the laud-giving names which he gained
        when fighting with the enemy, and at the same time lauds all the
        other Amatongo; the son reproves the father, saying,  span class=

        is the faith which children have in the Itongo [ancestral spirit]
        which is their father. And if there is a chief wife of a village, who
        has given birth to children, and if her husband is not dead, her
        Itongo is much reverenced by her husband and all the children. And
        that chief wife becomes an Itongo which takes great care of the

        When the
        missionaries inquired into the religious ideas of the Herero, a Bantu
        tribe of German South-West Africa, they heard much of a certain
        Mukuru, whom at first they took to be the great god of heaven and
        earth. Accordingly they adopted Mukuru as the native name for the
        Christian God, and set out on their mission to preach the glad
        tidings of Mukuru and his divine Son to the poor benighted heathen.
        But their first experiences were disconcerting. Again and again when
        they arrived in a village and announced their intention to the chief,
        they were brought up very short by that great man, who told them with
        an air of astonishment that he himself was Mukuru. For example,
        Messrs. Büttner and Irle paid a visit to an old chief named Tjenda
        and remonstrated with him on the impropriety of which he had been
        guilty in giving a baptized girl in marriage to a native gentleman
        whose domestic arrangements were framed on the polygamous patriarchal
        pattern. “Mukuru will punish you for
        that,” said Mr. Büttner.  span class=

            The worship of the dead among the
            Ovambo.
          
        

        The religion of
        the Ovambo, another Bantu tribe of German South-West Africa, is
        similar. They also recognize a great being named Kalunga, who created
        the world and man, but they neither fear nor worship him. A far
        greater part is played in the religion of the Ovambo by their belief
        in spirits, and amongst the worshipful spirits a conspicuous place is
        assigned to the souls of the dead. Every man leaves behind him at
        death a spirit, which continues to exist on earth and can influence
        the living; for example, it may enter into their bodies and thereby
        cause all sorts of sickness. However, the souls of ordinary dead men
        can exert their influence only on members of their own families; the
        souls of dead chiefs, on the other hand, have power over the rain,
        which they can either give or withhold. To these powerful spirits a
        portion of the new corn is offered at harvest as a thank-offering for
        their forbearance in not visiting the people with sickness, and above
        all for their bounty in sending down the fertilizing showers on the
        crops. The souls of dead magicians are particularly dreaded; and to
        prevent the multiplication of these dangerous spirits it is customary
        to dismember their bodies, severing the arms and legs from the trunk
        and cutting the tongue out of the mouth. If these precautions are
        taken immediately after death, the soul of the dead man cannot become
        a dangerous ghost; the mutilation of his body has practically
        disarmed his spirit. a id="noteref_483" name="noteref_483" href=

        The Wahehe, a
        Bantu tribe of German East Africa, believe in a great invisible
        spirit named Nguruhi, who created the world and rules both human
        destiny and the elements. He it is who makes the rain to fall, the
        sun to shine, the wind to blow, the thunder to roll, and the crops to
        grow. “This god is accordingly conceived as
        all-powerful, yet with the limitation that he only exercises a
        general power of direction over the world, especially human fate,

        Nguruhi is lord also of all the spirits of the dead ( span class=

        has not been further thought out. With this Supreme Being the people
        hold no intercourse by means of prayer, sacrifice, or in any other
        way. He stands remote from the religious life of the Wahehe and
        really serves only as an explanation of all those things and events
        which are otherwise inexplicable. All religious intercourse, all
        worship centres alone on the spirits of the dead. Hence if we speak
        of a religion of the Wahehe, it must be described as a pure worship
        of ancestors.” a id="noteref_484" name="noteref_484" href=

        with complete liberty of motion. Even the youngest children have
        souls which rank among the ancestral spirits at death. Hence the
        great multitude of the dead comprises spirits of all ages, from the
        infant one day old to the grey-haired patriarch. They are good or bad
        according as they were good or bad in life, and their social position
        also is unchanged. He who was powerful in life is powerful also in
        death; he who was a nobody among men is a nobody also among the
        spirits. Hence the ghost of a great man can do more for the living
        than the ghost of a common man; and the ghost of a man can do more
        than the ghost of a woman. Yet even the meanest ghost has power over
        the greatest living man, who can only defend himself by appealing for
        help to stronger ancestral spirits. Thus while the Supreme Being
        exercises a general superintendence over affairs, the real
        administration is in the hands of the ancestral spirits. While he,
        for example, regulates the weather as a whole, it is the ghosts who
        cause each particular shower to fall or the sun to break out in glory
        from the clouds. If he sends plagues on the whole people or stays the
        ravages of disease, it is the ghosts who make each individual sick or

        they accept all his gifts as a matter of course, and make him no

        To return, now, to

        Northern Rhodesia. The spirits of dead chiefs had priestesses to wait
        upon them, who were called the “wives of the
        departed.” These were elderly women who led a celibate life
        and swept the huts dedicated to the ghosts of the chiefs. The aid of
        these dead potentates was invoked in time of war and in seasons of
        drought, and special offerings were brought to their shrines at

        from the first-fruits, in front of the shrine. The ground about the
        tomb was then carefully weeded, and the blood of the sacrificial
        victim sprinkled on the freshly turned up soil and on the rafters of
        the little hut. After thanking the ghost of his grandfather for the

        flocked together from the outlying districts under their respective
        captains. In the dusk of the evening the king and the elderly women,
        who passed for the wives of the dead kings and tended their shrines
        at the capital, went and prayed at these shrines that the souls of
        the departed monarchs would keep the war-path free from foes and lead
        the king in a straight course to the enemy's stockade. These solemn
        prayers the king led in person, and the women beat their bare breasts
        as they joined in the earnest appeal. Next morning the whole army was

            Among these tribes the spirits of
            dead chiefs or kings are thought sometimes to take bodily
            possession of men and women or to be incarnate in animals.
          
        

        Among these tribes
        of Northern Rhodesia the spirits of dead chiefs or kings sometimes
        take possession of the bodies of live men or women and prophesy
        through their mouths. When the spirit of a dead chief comes over a
        man, he begins to roar like a lion, whereupon the women gather
        together and beat the drums, shouting that the chief has come to
        visit the village. The man thus temporarily inspired will prophesy of
        future wars or impending attacks by lions. While the inspiration
        lasts, he may eat nothing cooked by fire, but only unfermented dough.
        However, the spirit of a departed chief takes possession of women
        oftener than of men. “These women assert that
        they are possessed by the soul of some dead chief, and when they feel
        the divine afflatus, whiten their faces to attract attention, and
        anoint themselves with flour, which has a religious and sanctifying
        potency. One of their number beats a drum, and the others dance,
        singing at the same time a weird song, with curious intervals.
        Finally, when they have arrived at the requisite pitch of religious
        exaltation, the possessed woman falls to the ground, and bursts forth
        [pg 193] a name="Pg193"
        id="Pg193" class="tei tei-anchor"> into a low and almost
        inarticulate chant, which has a most uncanny effect. All are silent

        Sometimes the spirits of departed chiefs are reincarnated in animals,
        which are then revered as the abodes of the dead rulers. Thus the
        paramount chief of the Amambwe is incarnated after death in the form
        of a young lion, while Bisa and Wiwa chiefs come back in the shape of
        pythons. In one of the rest-houses near Fife a tame python waxed fat
        on the offerings of fowls and sour beer which the Winamwanga
        presented to it in the fond belief that it housed the spirit of one
        of their dead chiefs. One day unfortunately for himself the reptile
        deity ventured to dispute the possession of the rest-house with a
        German cattle-dealer who was passing by; a discharge of shot settled
        the dispute in favour of the cattle-dealer, and the worshippers of
        the deity beheld him no more. a id="noteref_496" name="noteref_496"

            Belief of the Barotse in a supreme
            god Niambe.
          
        

        Another Bantu
        people who worship the spirits of their dead kings are the Barotse or
        Marotse of the Upper Zambesi. The Barotse believe in a supreme god,
        the creator of all things, whom they call Niambe. He lives in the
        sun, and by his marriage with the moon begat the world, the animals,
        and last of all men. But the cunning and ferocity of his creature man
        terrified the beneficent creator, so that he fled from earth and
        escaped up the thread of a spider's web to heaven. There he still
        retains a certain power to interfere in human affairs, and that is
        why men sometimes pray and sacrifice to him. For example, the
        worshipper salutes the rising sun and offers him a vessel of water,
        no doubt to quench the thirst of the deity on his hot journey across
        the sky. Again, when a long drought has prevailed, a black ox is
        sacrificed to Niambe “as a symbol of the
        clouds big with the longed-for rain.” And before they sow the
        fields, the women pile the seeds and their digging hoes in a heap,
        and pray to the god that he would render their labour fruitful. a id=

        Yet while they
        acknowledge the divine supremacy of Niambe, the Barotse address their
        prayers most frequently to the inferior deities, the  span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"> span style=
        "font-style: italic">ditino, who are the deified kings
        of the country. The tombs of the departed monarchs may be seen near
        the villages which they inhabited in life. Each tomb stands in a
        grove of beautiful trees and is encircled by a tall palisade of
        pointed stakes, covered with fine mats, like the palisade which
        surrounds the royal residence of a living king. Such an enclosure is
        sacred; the people are forbidden to enter it lest they should disturb
        the ghost of him who sleeps below. But the inhabitants of the nearest
        village are charged with the duty of keeping the tomb and the
        enclosure in good order, repairing the palisade, and replacing the
        mats when they are worn out. Once a month, at the new moon, the women
        sweep not only the grave and the enclosure but the whole village. The
        guardian of the tomb is at the same time a priest; he acts as
        intermediary between the god and the people who come to pray to the
        deity. He bears the title of Ngomboti; he alone has the right to
        enter the sacred enclosure; the profane multitude must stand at a
        respectful distance. Even the king himself, when he comes to consult
        one of his ancestors, is forbidden to set foot on the holy ground. In
        presence of the god, or, as they call him, the Master of the Tomb,
        the monarch must bear himself like a slave in the presence of his
        lord. He kneels down near the entrance, claps his hands, and gives
        the royal salute; and from within the enclosure the priest solemnly
        returns the salute, just as the king himself, when he holds his
        court, returns the salute of his subjects. Then the suppliant,
        whether king or commoner, makes his petition to the deity and
        deposits his offering; for no man may pray to the god with empty
        hands. Inside the enclosure, close to the entrance, is a hole which
        is supposed to serve as a channel of communication with the spirit of
        the deified king. In it the offerings are placed. Often they consist
        of milk which is poured into the hole; and the faster it drains away,
        the more favourably inclined is the god thought to be to the
        petitioner. More solid offerings, such as flesh, clothes, and glass
        beads, become the property of the priest after they have been allowed
        to lie for a decent time beside the sacred  span class="tei tei-pb"

        are thus consulted on matters of public concern as well as by private
        individuals touching their own affairs. If a war is to be waged, if a
        plague is raging among the people or a murrain among the cattle, if
        the land is parched with drought, in short, if any danger threatens
        or any calamity has afflicted the country, recourse is had to these
        local gods, dwelling each in his shady grove, not far from the abodes
        of the living. They are near, but the great god in heaven is far
        away. What wonder, therefore, that their help is often sought while
        he is neglected? They are national heroes as well as gods; their
        history is remembered; men tell of the doughty deeds they did in
        their lifetime; why should they not be able to succour their votaries
        now that they have put on immortality? All over the country these
        temple-tombs may be seen. They serve as historical monuments to
        recall to the people the names of their former kings and the annals
        of their country. One of the most popular of the royal shrines is
        near Senanga at the southern end of the great plain of the Barotse.
        Voyagers who go down the Zambesi do not fail to pay their devotions
        at the shrine, that the god of the place may make their voyage to
        prosper and may guard the frail canoe from shipwreck in the rush and
        roar of the rapids; and when they return in safety they repair again
        to the sacred spot to deposit a thank-offering for the protection of
        the deity. a id="noteref_498" name="noteref_498" href=

            been an important element in the religion of many African
            tribes.
          
        

        The foregoing
        examples suffice to prove that the worship of dead chiefs and kings
        has been an important, perhaps we may even say, the most important
        element in the religion of many African tribes. Regarded from the
        native point of view nothing could be more natural. The king rules
        over his people in life; and since all these tribes entertain a firm
        and unquestioning belief not only in the existence but in the power
        of the spirits of the dead, they necessarily conclude that of all the
        departed spirits none can be so potent for good or evil, none
        therefore need to be propitiated so earnestly by prayer and
        sacrifice, as the souls of dead kings. Thus while every family
        worships privately the [pg
        196]
        spirits of its own ancestors, the whole tribe worships publicly the
        spirits of its departed monarchs, paying to each of these invisible
        potentates, whose reality they never dream of doubting, a homage of
        precisely the same sort as that which they render to his living
        successor on the throne. Such a religion of the dead is by no means
        incompatible with the recognition of higher spiritual powers who may
        have an origin quite independent of the worship of ancestors. We have
        seen in point of fact that many tribes, whose practical religion is
        concentrated chiefly on their dead, nevertheless acknowledge the
        existence of a supreme god, the creator of man and of all things,
        whom they do not regard as a glorified ghost. The Baganda, the most
        progressive and advanced of all the Bantu tribes, had a whole
        pantheon of gods whom they sharply distinguished from the worshipful
        spirits of their forefathers.

        

        
          
            Perhaps some African gods, who are
            now distinguished from ghosts, were once dead men.
          
        

        Yet in spite of
        this distinction we may suspect that in many cases the seeming line
        of division between gods and worshipful ghosts is deceptive; and that
        the magic touch of time, which distorts and magnifies the past,
        especially among peoples who see it only through the haze of oral
        tradition, has glorified and transfigured many a dead man into a
        deity. This at all events seems to have been the history of some of
        the Baganda gods. On this subject our best authority says that
        “the principal gods appear to have been at
        one time human beings, noted for their skill and bravery, who were
        afterwards deified by the people and invested with supernatural
        powers.” a id="noteref_499" name="noteref_499" href=

        “Mukasa held the highest rank among the gods
        of Uganda. He was a benign god; he never asked for the life of any
        human being, but animals were sacrificed to him at the yearly
        festivals, and also at other times when the king, or a leading chief,
        wished to consult him. He had nothing to do with war, but sought to
        heal the bodies and minds of men. He was the god of plenty; he gave
        the people an increase of food, cattle, and children. From the
        legends still current it seems to be almost certain that he was a
        human being who, because of his benevolence, came to be regarded as a
        god.... The legends about Mukasa are of great interest; they show how
        the human element [pg
        197] has
        been lost in the divine, how the natural has been effaced by the
        supernatural, until, in the minds of the common people, only the
        supernatural remains.” a id="noteref_500" name="noteref_500"

            The human remains of Kibuka, the
            war-god of the Baganda.
          
        

        If we cannot prove
        that the great god Mukasa himself was once a man, we have very
        tangible evidence that his brother the war-god Kibuka was so. For
        like the dead kings of Uganda, Kibuka was worshipped in a great
        conical hut resembling the huts which living people inhabit: like
        them, his spirit was supposed to enter from time to time into the
        body of his priest and to give oracles through him; and like them he
        was represented in his temple by his personal relics, his jawbone and
        his navel-string, which were rescued from the ruins of his temple and
        now rest in the Ethnological Museum at Cambridge. In face of this
        complete parallelism between the god and the kings whose personal
        existence is not open to question, it seems difficult to doubt that
        Kibuka was once like them a real man, and that he spoke with the
        jawbone and made bodily use of the other corporeal organs which were
        preserved in his temple. a id="noteref_501" name="noteref_501" href=

            Thus it is possible that Osiris and
            Isis may have been a real king and queen of Egypt, perhaps
            identical with King Khent and his queen.
          
        

        These analogies
        lend some support to the theory that in ancient Egypt, where the
        kings were worshipped by their people both in life and death, Osiris
        may have been originally nothing but one of these deified monarchs
        whose worship gradually eclipsed that of all the rest and ended by
        rivalling or even surpassing that of the great sun-god himself. We
        have seen that at Abydos, one of the principal centres of his
        worship, the tomb of Osiris was identified with the tomb of King
        Khent, one of the earliest monarchs of the first Egyptian dynasty,
        and that in this tomb were found a woman's richly jewelled arm and a
        human skull lacking the lower jawbone, which may well be the head of
        the king himself and the arm of his queen. The carved monument of
        Osiris which was found in the sepulchral chamber appears indeed to be
        a [pg 198] a name=
        "Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"> work of late Egyptian
        art, but it may have replaced an earlier sarcophagus. Certainly we
        may reasonably suppose that the identification of the tomb of Osiris
        with the tomb of King Khent was very ancient; for though the priests
        may have renewed the sculptured effigy of the dead god, they would
        hardly dare to shift the site of the Holy Sepulchre. a id=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">502 Now the
        sepulchre is distant about a mile and a half from the temple in which
        Osiris was worshipped as a god. There is thus a curious coincidence,
        if there is nothing more, between the worship of Osiris and the
        worship of the dead kings of Uganda. As a dead king of Uganda was
        worshipped in a temple, while his headless body reposed at some
        distance in a royal tomb, and his head, without the lower jawbone,
        was buried by itself near the grave, so Osiris was worshipped in a
        temple not far from the royal tomb which tradition identified with
        his grave. Perhaps after all tradition was right. It is possible,
        though it would be very rash to affirm, that Osiris was no other than
        the historical King Khent of the first dynasty; a id="noteref_503"

        [pg 199] a name="Pg199"

        neighbouring temple. If that were so, we should be almost driven to
        conclude that the bejewelled woman's arm found in the tomb of Osiris
        is the arm of Isis.

        

        
          
            Suggested parallel between Osiris
            and Charlemagne.
          
        

        In support of the
        conclusion that the myth and religion of Osiris grew up round the
        revered memory of a dead man we may quote the words in which the
        historian of European morals describes the necessity under which the
        popular imagination labours of embodying its cherished ideals in
        living persons. He is referring to the dawn of the age of chivalry,
        when in the morning twilight the heroic figure of Charlemagne rose
        like a bright star above the political horizon, to be thenceforth
        encircled by a halo of romance like the nimbus that shone round the
        head of Osiris. “In order that the tendencies
        I have described should acquire their full force, it was necessary
        that they should be represented or illustrated in some great
        personage, who, by the splendour and the beauty of his career, could
        fascinate the imaginations of men. It is much easier to govern great
        masses of men through their imagination than through their reason.
        Moral principles rarely act powerfully upon the world, except by way
        of example or ideals. When the course of events has been to glorify
        the ascetic or monarchical or military spirit, a great saint, or
        sovereign, or soldier will arise, who will concentrate in one
        dazzling focus the blind tendencies of his time, kindle the
        enthusiasm and fascinate the imagination of the people. But for the
        prevailing tendency, the great man would not have arisen, or would
        not have exercised his great influence. But for the great man, whose
        career appealed vividly to the imagination, the prevailing tendency
        would never have acquired its full intensity.” a id=

            The question of the historical
            reality of Osiris left open.
          
        

        Whether the
        parallel thus suggested between Charlemagne, the mediaeval ideal of a
        Christian knight, and Osiris, the ancient Egyptian ideal of a just
        and beneficent monarch, holds good or not, it is now impossible to
        determine. For while Charlemagne stands near enough to allow us
        clearly to discern his historical reality, Osiris is so remote that
        we can no longer discriminate with any certitude between the
        [pg 200] a name="Pg200"
        id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"> elements of history and fable
        which appear to have blended in his traditional character. I am
        content to indicate bare possibilities: dogmatism on such points
        would be in the highest degree rash and unbecoming. Whether Osiris
        and Isis were from first to last purely imaginary beings, the ideal
        creations of a primitive philosophy, or whether they were originally
        a real man and woman about whom after death the myth-making fancy
        wove its gossamer rainbow-tinted web, is a question to which I am not
        bold enough to give a decided answer.

        Goddesses.

              Essential similarity of Adonis,
              Attis, and Osiris.
            
          

          We have now
          concluded our inquiry into the nature and worship of the three
          Oriental deities Adonis, Attis, and Osiris. The substantial
          similarity of their mythical character justifies us in treating of
          them together. All three apparently embodied the powers of
          fertility in general and of vegetation in particular. All three
          were believed to have died and risen again from the dead; and the
          divine death and resurrection of all three were dramatically
          represented at annual festivals, which their worshippers celebrated
          with alternate transports of sorrow and joy, of weeping and
          exultation. The natural phenomena thus mythically conceived and
          mythically represented were the great changes of the seasons,
          especially the most striking and impressive of all, the decay and
          revival of vegetation; and the intention of the sacred dramas was
          to refresh and strengthen, by sympathetic magic, the failing
          energies of nature, in order that the trees should bear fruit, that
          the corn should ripen, that men and animals should reproduce their
          kinds.

          

          
            
              The superiority of the goddesses
              associated with Adonis, Attis, and Osiris points to a system of
              mother-kin.
            
          

          But the three
          gods did not stand by themselves. The mythical personification of
          nature, of which all three were in at least one aspect the
          products, required that each of them should be coupled with a
          goddess, and in each case it appears that originally the goddess
          was a more powerful and important personage than the god. At all
          events it is always the god rather than the goddess who comes to a
          sad end, and whose death is annually mourned. Thus, whereas Osiris
          was slain by Typhon, his divine spouse Isis survived  span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202] a name="Pg202" id="Pg202"
          class="tei tei-anchor"> and brought him to life again. This
          feature of the myth seems to indicate that in the beginning Isis
          was, what Astarte and Cybele always continued to be, the stronger
          divinity of the pair. Now the superiority thus assigned to the
          goddess over the god is most naturally explained as the result of a
          social system in which maternity counted for more than paternity,
          descent being traced and property handed down through women rather
          than through men. At all events this explanation cannot be deemed
          intrinsically improbable if we can show that the supposed cause has
          produced the very same effect among existing peoples, about whose
          institutions we possess accurate information. This I will now
          endeavour to do.

              Mother-kin and father-kin. The
              Khasis of Assam have mother-kin, and among them goddesses
              predominate over gods and priestesses over priests.
            
          

          The social
          system which traces descent and transmits property through the
          mother alone may be called mother-kin, while the converse system
          which traces descent and transmits property through the father
          alone may be called father-kin. a id="noteref_505" name=

          business of the women alone. “This cardinal

          seems clear that in any agricultural people who, like the Pelew

          women, the conception of a great Mother Goddess, the divine source
          of all fertility, might easily originate. Perhaps the same social
          and industrial conditions may have combined to develop the great

          manner which are believed to be characteristic of the indwelling
          divinity. These inspired men ( span class=

          priests is more and more in the ascendant and threatens, if
          unchecked, to develop before long into an absolute theocracy which

              Parallel between the Pelew Islands
              of to-day and the religious and social state of Western Asia
              and Egypt in antiquity.
            
          

          Thus the
          present, or at least the recent, state of society and religion in
          the Pelew Islands presents some interesting parallels to the social
          and religious condition of Western Asia and Egypt in early days, if
          the conclusions reached in this work are correct. In both regions
          we see a society based on mother-kin developing a religion in which
          goddesses of the clan originally occupied the foremost place,
          though in later times, as the clans coalesced into states, the old
          goddesses have been rivalled and to some extent supplanted by the
          new male gods of the enlarged pantheon. But in the religion of the
          Pelew Islanders, as in that of the Khasis and the ancient
          Egyptians, the balance of power has never wholly shifted from the
          female to the male line, because society has never passed from
          mother-kin to father-kin. And in the Pelew Islands as in the
          ancient East we see the tide of political power running strongly in
          the direction of theocracy, the people resigning the conduct of
          affairs into the hands of men who claimed to rule them in the name
          of the gods. In the Pelew Islands such men might have developed
          into divine kings like those of Babylon and Egypt, if the natural
          course of evolution had not been cut short by the intervention of
          Europe. a id="noteref_525" name="noteref_525" href=

              Mother-kin does not imply that the
              government is in the hands of women.
            
          

          The evidence of
          the Khasis and the Pelew Islanders, two peoples very remote and
          very different from each other, suffices to prove that the
          influence which mother-kin may exert on religion is real and deep.
          But in order [pg
          209]
          to dissipate misapprehensions, which appear to be rife on this
          subject, it may be well to remind or inform the reader that the
          ancient and widespread custom of tracing descent and inheriting
          property through the mother alone does not by any means imply that
          the government of the tribes which observe the custom is in the
          hands of women; in short, it should always be borne in mind that
          mother-kin does not mean mother-rule. On the contrary, the practice
          of mother-kin prevails most extensively amongst the lowest savages,
          with whom woman, instead of being the ruler of man, is always his
          drudge and often little better than his slave. Indeed, so far is
          the system from implying any social superiority of women that it
          probably took its rise from what we should regard as their deepest
          degradation, to wit, from a state of society in which the relations
          of the sexes were so loose and vague that children could not be
          fathered on any particular man. a id="noteref_526" name=
          "noteref_526" href="#note_526"> span class=

              The inheritance of property,
              especially of landed property, through the mother certainly
              tends to raise the social importance of women, but this
              tendency is never carried so far as to subordinate men
              politically to women.
            
          

          When we pass
          from the purely savage state to that higher plane of culture in
          which the accumulation of property, and especially of landed
          property, has become a powerful instrument of social and political
          influence, we naturally find that wherever the ancient preference
          for the female line of descent has been retained, it tends to
          increase the importance and enhance the dignity of woman; and her
          aggrandizement is most marked in princely families, where she
          either herself holds royal authority as well as private property,
          or at least transmits them both to her consort or her children. But
          this social advance of women has never been carried so far as to
          place men as a whole in a position of political subordination to
          them. Even where the system of mother-kin in regard to descent and
          property has prevailed most fully, the actual government has
          generally, if not invariably, remained in the hands of men.
          Exceptions have no doubt occurred; women have occasionally arisen
          [pg 210] a name=
          "Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"> who by sheer force
          of character have swayed for a time the destinies of their people.
          But such exceptions are rare and their effects transitory; they do
          not affect the truth of the general rule that human society has
          been governed in the past and, human nature remaining the same, is
          likely to be governed in the future, mainly by masculine force and
          masculine intelligence.

          

          
            
              Thus while the Khasis and Pelew
              Islanders have mother-kin, they are governed by men, not by
              women.
            
          

          To this rule the
          Khasis, with their elaborate system of mother-kin, form no
          exception. For among them, while landed property is both
          transmitted through women and held by women alone, political power
          is transmitted indeed through women, but is held by men; in other
          words, the Khasi tribes are, with a single exception, governed by
          kings, not by queens. And even in the one tribe, which is nominally
          ruled by women, the real power is delegated by the reigning queen
          or High Priestess to her son, her nephew, or a more distant male
          relation. In all the other tribes the kingship may be held by a
          woman only on the failure of all male heirs in the female
          line. a id="noteref_527" name="noteref_527" href=
          "#note_527"> span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">527 So
          far is mother-kin from implying mother-rule. A Khasi king inherits
          power in right of his mother, but he exercises it in his own.
          Similarly the Pelew Islanders, in spite of their system of
          mother-kin, are governed by chiefs, not by chieftainesses. It is
          true that there are chieftainesses, and that they indirectly
          exercise much influence; but their direct authority is limited to
          the affairs of women, especially to the administration of the
          women's clubs or associations, which  span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          to take another example, the Melanesians, like the Khasis and the

          divided into exogamous clans with descent in the female line;
          “but it must be understood that the mother
          is in no way the head of the family. The house of the family is the
          father's, the garden is his, the rule and government are

              The theory of a gynaecocracy and
              of the predominance of the female imagination in religion is an
              idle dream.
            
          

          We may safely
          assume that the practice has been the same among all the many
          peoples who have retained the ancient system of mother-kin under a
          monarchical constitution. In Africa, for example, the chieftainship
          or kingship often descends in the female line, but it is men, not
          women, who inherit it. a id="noteref_530" name="noteref_530" href=
          "#note_530"> span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">530 The
          theory of a gynaecocracy is in truth a dream of visionaries and
          pedants. And equally chimerical is the idea that the predominance
          of goddesses under a system of mother-kin like that of the Khasis
          is a creation of the female mind. If women ever created gods, they
          would be more likely to give them masculine than feminine features.
          In point of fact the great religious ideals which have permanently
          impressed themselves on the world seem always to have been a
          product of the male imagination. Men make gods and women worship
          them. The combination of ancestor-worship with mother-kin furnishes
          a simple and sufficient explanation of the superiority of goddesses
          over gods in a state of society where these conditions prevail. Men
          naturally assign the first place in their devotions to the
          ancestress from whom they trace their descent. We need not resort
          to a fantastic hypothesis of the preponderance of the feminine
          fancy in order to account for the facts.

          

          
            
              But mother-kin is a solid fact,
              which can hardly have failed to modify the religion of the
              peoples who practise it.
            
          

          The theory that
          under a system of mother-kin the women rule the men and set up
          goddesses for them to [pg
          212]
          worship is indeed so improbable in itself, and so contrary to
          experience, that it scarcely deserves the serious attention which
          it appears to have received. a id="noteref_531" name="noteref_531"
          href="#note_531"> span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">531 But
          when we have brushed aside these cobwebs, as we must do, we are
          still left face to face with the solid fact of the wide prevalence
          of mother-kin, that is, of a social system which traces descent and
          transmits property through women and not through men. That a social
          system so widely spread and so deeply rooted should have affected
          the religion of the peoples who practise it, may reasonably be
          inferred, especially when we remember that in primitive communities
          the social relations of the gods commonly reflect the social
          relations of their worshippers. How the system of mother-kin may
          mould religious ideas and customs, creating goddesses and assigning
          at least a nominal superiority to priestesses over priests, is
          shown with perfect lucidity by the example of the Khasis, and
          hardly less clearly by the example of the Pelew Islanders. It
          cannot therefore be rash to hold that what the system has certainly
          done for these peoples, it may well have done for many more. But
          unfortunately through lack of documentary evidence we are seldom
          able to trace its influence so clearly.

          While the
          combination of mother-kin in society with a preference for
          goddesses in religion is to be found as a matter of fact among the
          Khasis and Pelew Islanders of to-day, the former prevalence of
          mother-kin in the lands where the great goddesses Astarte and
          Cybele were worshipped is a matter of inference only. In later
          times father-kin had certainly displaced mother-kin among the
          Semitic worshippers of Astarte, and probably the same change had
          taken place among the Phrygian worshippers of Cybele. Yet the older

          we may conjecture that in former times it was widely spread through
          Asia Minor. The secluded situation and rugged mountains of Lycia
          favoured the survival of a native language and of native
          institutions long after these had disappeared from the wide plains
          and fertile valleys which lay on the highroads of war and commerce.
          Lycia was to Asia Minor what the highlands of Wales and of Scotland
          have been to Britain, the last entrenchments where the old race
          stood at bay. And even among the Semites of antiquity, though
          father-kin finally prevailed in matters of descent and property,
          traces of an older system of mother-kin, with its looser sexual
          relations, appear to have long survived in the sphere of religion.
          At all events one of the most learned and acute of Semitic scholars
          adduced what he regarded as evidence sufficient to prove
          “that in old Arabian religion gods and
          goddesses often occurred in pairs, the goddess being the greater,
          so that the god cannot be her Baal, that the goddess is often a
          mother without being a wife, and the god her son, and that the
          progress of things was towards changing goddesses into gods or
          lowering them beneath the male deity.” a id="noteref_533"

          In Egypt the

          times, and it was traditionally  span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          her husband's murder and had continued to reign after his decease,
          conferring benefits on mankind. “For these
          reasons,” says Diodorus Siculus, “it
          was appointed that the queen should enjoy greater power and honour
          than the king, and that among private people the wife should rule
          over her husband, in the marriage contract the husband agreeing to

              Marriages of brothers with sisters
              in ancient Egypt.
            
          

          The same legal
          superiority of women over men accounts for the most remarkable
          feature in the social system of the ancient Egyptians, to wit, the
          marriage of full brothers with full sisters. That marriage, which
          to us seems strange and unnatural, was by no means a whim of the
          reigning Ptolemies; on the contrary, these Macedonian conquerors
          appear, with characteristic prudence, to have borrowed the custom
          from their Egyptian predecessors for the express purpose of
          conciliating native prejudice. In the eyes of the Egyptians
          “marriage between brother and sister was
          the best of marriages, and it acquired an ineffable degree of
          sanctity when the brother and sister who contracted it were
          themselves born of a brother and sister, who had in their turn also
          sprung from a union of the same sort.” a id="noteref_536"

          that such unions were the rule, not the exception, in ancient
          Egypt, and that they continued to form the majority of marriages
          long after the Romans had obtained a firm footing in the country.
          As we cannot suppose that Roman influence was used to promote a
          custom which must have been abhorrent to Roman instincts, we may
          safely assume that the proportion of brother and sister marriages
          in Egypt had been still greater in the days when the country was
          free. a id="noteref_538" name="noteref_538" href=

              Such marriages were based on a
              wish to keep the property in the family.
            
          

          It would
          doubtless be a mistake to treat these marriages as a relic of
          savagery, as a survival of a tribal communism which knew no bar to
          the intercourse of the sexes. For such a theory would not explain
          why union with a sister was not only allowed, but preferred to all
          others. The true motive of that preference was most probably the
          wish of brothers to obtain for their own use the family property,
          which belonged of right to their sisters, and which otherwise they
          would have seen in the enjoyment of strangers, the husbands of
          their sisters. This is the system which in Ceylon is known as
           span style=

          daughter, not the son, is the heir. She stays at home, and her
          husband comes and lives with her in the house; but her brother goes
          away and dwells in his wife's home, inheriting nothing from his
          parents. a id="noteref_539" name="noteref_539" href=

          a system could not fail in time to prove irksome. Men would be loth
          to quit the old home, resign the ancestral property to a stranger,
          and go out to seek their fortune empty-handed in the world. The
          remedy was obvious. A man had nothing to do but to marry his sister
          himself instead of handing her over to another. Having done so he
          stayed at home and enjoyed the family estate in virtue of his
          marriage with the heiress. This simple and perfectly effective

              Thus the traditional marriage of
              Osiris with his sister Isis reflected a real social custom. The
              passing of the old world in Egypt.
            
          

          Thus the union
          of Osiris with his sister Isis was not a freak of the
          story-teller's fancy: it reflected a social custom which was itself
          based on practical considerations of the most solid kind. When we
          reflect that this practice of mother-kin as opposed to father-kin
          survived down to the latest times of antiquity, not in an obscure
          and barbarous tribe, but in a nation whose immemorial civilization
          was its glory and the wonder of the world, we may without being
          extravagant suppose that a similar practice formerly prevailed in
          Syria and Phrygia, and that it accounts for the superiority of the
          goddess over the god in the divine partnerships of Adonis and
          Astarte, of Attis and Cybele. But the ancient system both of
          society and of religion had undergone far more change in these
          countries than in Egypt, where to the last the main outlines of the
          old structure could be traced in the national institutions to which
          the Egyptians clung with a passionate, a fanatical devotion.
          Mother-kin, the divinity of kings and queens, a sense of the
          original connexion of the gods with nature—these things outlived
          the Persian, the Macedonian, the Roman conquest, and only perished
          under the more powerful solvent of Christianity. But the old order
          did not vanish at once with the official establishment of the new
          religion. In the age of Constantine the Greeks of Egypt still
          attributed the rise of the Nile to Serapis, the later form of
          Osiris, alleging [pg
          217]
          that the inundation could not take place if the standard cubit,
          which was used to measure it, were not deposited according to
          custom in the temple of the god. The emperor ordered the cubit to
          be transferred to a church; and next year, to the general surprise,
          the river rose just as usual. a id="noteref_541" name="noteref_541"

          at a later time Athanasius himself had to confess with sorrow and

          have vied with each other in mutual atrocities. After its fall the
          temples were levelled with the ground or converted into churches,
          and the images of the old gods went to the melting-pot to be

              Egyptian conservatism partly an
              effect of natural conditions and habits of life.
            
          

          The singular
          tenacity with which the Egyptian people maintained their
          traditional beliefs and customs for thousands of years sprang no
          doubt from the stubborn conservatism of the national character. Yet
          that conservatism was itself in great measure an effect of
          geographical and climatic conditions and of the ways of life which
          they favoured. Surrounded on every side by deserts or almost
          harbourless seas, the Egyptians occupied a position of great
          natural strength which for long ages together protected them from
          invasion and allowed their native habits to set and harden,
          undisturbed by the subversive influence of foreign conquest. The
          wonderful regularity of nature in Egypt also conduced to a
          corresponding stability in the minds of the people. Year in, year
          out, the immutable succession of the seasons brought with it the
          same unvarying round of agricultural toil. What the fathers had
          done, the sons did in the same manner at the same season, and so it
          went on from [pg
          218]
          generation to generation. This monotonous routine is common indeed
          to all purely agricultural communities, and everywhere tends to
          beget in the husbandman a settled phlegmatic habit of mind very
          different from the mobility, the alertness, the pliability of
          character which the hazards and uncertainties of commerce and the
          sea foster in the merchant and the sailor. The saturnine
          temperament of the farmer is as naturally averse to change as the
          more mercurial spirit of the trader and the seaman is predisposed
          to it. But the stereotyping of ideas and of customs was carried
          further in Egypt than in most lands devoted to husbandry by reason
          of the greater uniformity of the Egyptian seasons and the more
          complete isolation of the country.

          

          
            
              The old type of Osiris better
              preserved than those of Adonis and Attis.
            
          

          The general
          effect of these causes was to create a type of national character
          which presented many points of resemblance to that of the Chinese.
          In both we see the same inflexible strength of will, the same
          astonishing industry, the same strange blend of humanity and
          savagery, the same obstinate adherence to tradition, the same pride
          of race and of ancient civilization, the same contempt for
          foreigners as for upstarts and barbarians, the same patient outward
          submission to an alien rule combined with an unshakeable inward
          devotion to native ideals. It was this conservative temper of the
          people, bred in great measure of the physical nature of their land,
          which, so to say, embalmed the memory of Osiris long after the
          corresponding figures of Adonis and Attis had suffered decay. For
          while Egypt enjoyed profound repose, the tides of war and conquest,
          of traffic and commerce, had for centuries rolled over Western
          Asia, the native home of Adonis and Attis; and if the shock of
          nationalities in this great meeting-ground of East and West was
          favourable to the rise of new faiths and new moralities, it was in
          the same measure unfavourable to the preservation of the old.

              The sacrifices to Moloch may have
              been intended to prolong the king's life. Vicarious sacrifices
              for a king or queen in Sweden, Persia, and Madagascar.
            
          

          If, however,
          these sacrifices were originally offered to or in behalf of the
          human king, it is possible that they were intended to prolong his
          life and strengthen his hands for the performance of those magical
          functions which he was expected to discharge for the good of his
          people. The old kings of Sweden answered with their heads for the
          fertility of the ground, a id="noteref_549" name="noteref_549"

          we read that one of them, Aun or On by name, sacrificed nine of his
          sons to Odin at Upsala in order that his own life might be spared.
          After the sacrifice of his second son he received from the god an
          oracle that he should live as long as he gave him one of his sons
          every tenth year. When he had thus sacrificed seven sons, the
          ruthless father still lived, but was so feeble that he could no
          longer walk and had to be carried in a chair. Then he offered up
          his eighth son and lived ten years more, bedridden. After that he
          sacrificed his ninth son, and lived ten years more, drinking out of
          a horn like a weaned child. He now wished to sacrifice his last
          remaining son to Odin, but the Swedes would not let him, so he died
          and was buried in a mound at Upsala. a id="noteref_550" name=

          the story is true—and it rests on the authority of Herodotus, a
          nearly contemporary witness—we may surmise that the aged queen
          acted thus with an eye to the future rather than to the past; she
          hoped that the grim god of the nether-world would accept the young
          victims in her stead, and let her live for many years. The same
          idea of vicarious suffering comes out in a tradition told of a
          certain Hova king of Madagascar, who bore the sonorous name of
          Andriamasinavalona. When he had grown sickly and feeble, the oracle
          was consulted as to the best way of restoring him to health.
          “The following result was the consequence
          of the directions of the oracle. A speech was first delivered to
          the people, offering great honours and rewards to the family of any
          individual who would freely offer himself to be sacrificed, in
          order to the king's recovery. The people shuddered at the idea, and
          ran away in different directions. One man, however, presented
          himself for the purpose, and his offer was accepted. The sacrificer
          girded up his loins, sharpened his knife, and bound the victim.
          After which, he was laid down with his head towards the east, upon
          a mat spread for the purpose, according to the custom with animals
          on such occasions, when the priest appeared, to proceed with all
          solemnity in slaughtering the victim by cutting his throat. A
          quantity of red liquid, however, which had been prepared from a
          native dye, was spilled in the ceremony; and, to the amazement of
          those who looked on, blood seemed to be flowing all around. The
          man, as might be supposed, was unhurt; but the king rewarded him
          and his descendants with the perpetual privilege of exemption from
          capital punishment for any violation of the laws. The descendants
          of the man to this day form a particular class, called  span class=

              Custom in the Niger delta.
            
          

          Sometimes,
          however, the practices intended to prolong the king's life seem to
          rest on a theory of nutrition rather than of substitution; in other
          words, the life of the victims, instead of being offered
          vicariously to a god, is apparently supposed to pass directly into
          the body of the sacrificer, thus refreshing his failing strength
          and prolonging his existence. So regarded, the custom is magical
          rather than religious in character, since the desired effect is
          thought to follow directly without the intervention of a deity. At
          all events, it can be shown that sacrifices of this sort have been
          offered to prolong the life of kings in other parts of the world.
          Thus in regard to [pg
          222]
          some of the negroes who inhabit the delta of the Niger we read
          that: “A custom which formerly was
          practised by the Ibani, and is still prevalent among all the
          interior tribes, consists in prolonging the life of a king or
          ancestral representative by the daily, or possibly weekly,
          sacrifice of a chicken and egg. Every morning, as soon as the
          patriarch has risen from his bed, the sacrificial articles are
          procured either by his mother, head wife, or eldest daughter, and
          given to the priest, who receives them on the open space in front
          of the house. When this has been reported to the patriarch, he
          comes outside and, sitting down, joins in the ceremony. Taking the
          chicken in his hand, the priest first of all touches the
          patriarch's face with it, and afterwards passes it over the whole
          of his body. He then cuts its throat and allows the blood to drop
          on the ground. Mixing the blood and the earth into a paste, he rubs
          it on the old man's forehead and breast, and this is not to be
          washed off under any circumstances until the evening. The chicken
          and the egg, also a piece of white cloth, are now tied on to a
          stick, which, if a stream is in the near vicinity, is planted in
          the ground at the water-side. During the carriage of these articles
          to the place in question, all the wives and many members of the
          household accompany the priest, invoking the deity as they go to
          prolong their father's life. This is done in the firm conviction
          that through the sacrifice of each chicken his life will be
          accordingly prolonged.” a id="noteref_554" name=

          The ceremony
          thus described is, like so many other rites, a combination of magic
          and religion; for whereas the prayers to the god are religious, the
          passing of the victim over the king's body and the smearing of him
          with its blood are magical, being plainly intended to convey to him
          directly, without the mediation of any deity, the life of the fowl.
          In the following instances the practices for prolonging the king's
          life seem to be purely magical. Among the Zulus, at one of the
          annual feasts of first-fruits, a bull is killed by a particular
          regiment. In slaughtering the beast they may not use spears or
          sticks, but must break its neck or choke it with their bare hands.
          “It is then burned, and the strength of the
          bull is supposed to enter into the king, thereby prolonging his
          life.” a id="noteref_555" name="noteref_555" href=

          Again, in an early Portuguese historian we read of a Caffre king of
          East Africa that “it is related of this
          Monomotapa that he has a house where he commands bodies of men who
          have died at the hands of the law to be hung up, and where thus
          hanging all the humidity [pg

          has dropped from them and they shrink and dry up he commands them
          to be taken down and buried, and with the fat and moisture in the
          vases they say he makes ointments with which he anoints himself in
          order to enjoy long life—which is his belief—and also to be proof
          against receiving harm from sorcerers.” a id="noteref_556"

          The Baganda of
          Central Africa used to kill men on various occasions for the
          purpose of prolonging the king's life; in all cases it would seem
          to be thought that the life of the murdered man was in some
          mysterious fashion transferred to the king, so that the monarch
          received thereby a fresh accession of vital energy. For example,
          whenever a particular royal drum had a new skin put on it, not only
          was a cow killed to furnish the skin and its blood run into the
          drum, but a man was beheaded and the spouting blood from the
          severed neck was allowed to gush into the drum,  span class=

          Again, at the coronation of a new king, a royal chamberlain was
          chosen to take charge of the king's inner court and to guard his
          wives. From the royal presence the chamberlain was conducted, along
          with eight captives, to one of the human shambles; there he was
          blindfolded while seven of the men were clubbed to death, only the
          dull thud and crashing sound telling him of what was taking place.
          But when the seven had been thus despatched, the bandages were
          removed from the chamberlain's eyes and he witnessed the death of
          the eighth. As each man was killed, his belly was ripped open and
          his bowels pulled out and hung round the chamberlain's neck. These
          deaths were said to add to the King's vigour and to make the
          chamberlain strong and faithful. a id="noteref_558" name=

          were these the only human sacrifices offered at a king's coronation
          for the purpose of strengthening the new monarch. When the king had
          reigned two or three months, he was expected to hunt first a
          leopard and then a bushbuck. On the night after the hunt of the
          bushbuck, one of the ministers of State caught a man and brought
          him before the king in the dark; the king speared him slightly,
          then the man was strangled and the body thrown into a papyrus
          swamp, that it might never be found again. Another ceremony
          performed about this time to confirm the king in his kingdom was to
          catch a man, bind him, and bring him before the king, who wounded
          him slightly with a spear. Then the man was put to death. These men
          were killed to invigorate the king. a id="noteref_559" name=

              Chief's son killed to provide the
              king with anklets.
            
          

          When a king of
          Uganda had reigned some time, apparently several years, a ceremony
          was performed for the sake of prolonging his life. For this purpose
          the king paid a visit—a fatal visit—to a chief of the Lung-fish
          clan, who bore the title of Nankere and resided in the district of
          Busiro, where the tombs and temples of the kings were situated.
          When the time for the ceremony had been appointed, the chief chose
          one of his own sons, who was to die that the king might live. If
          the chief had no son, a near relation was compelled to serve as a
          substitute. The hapless youth was fed and clothed and treated in
          all respects like a prince, and taken to live in a particular house
          near the place where the king was to lodge for the ceremony. When
          the destined victim had been feasted and guarded for a month, the
          king set out on his progress from the capital. On the way he
          stopped at the temple of the great god Mukasa; there he changed his
          garments, leaving behind him in the temple those which he had been
          wearing. Also he left behind him all his anklets, and did not put
          on any fresh ones, for he was shortly to receive new anklets of a
          remarkable kind. When the king arrived at his destination, the
          chief met him, and the two exchanged a gourd of beer. At this
          interview the king's mother was present to see her son for the last
          time; for from that moment the two were never allowed to look upon
          each other again. The chief addressed the king's mother informing
          her of this final separation; then turning to the king he said,
          “You are now of age; go and live longer
          than your forefathers.” Then the chief's son was introduced.
          The chief took him by the hand and presented him to the king, who
          passed him on to the body-guard; they led him outside and killed
          him by beating him with their clenched fists. The muscles from the
          back of the body of the murdered youth were removed and made into
          two anklets for the king, and a strip of skin cut from the corpse
          was made into a whip, which was kept in the royal enclosure for
          special feasts. The dead body was thrown on waste land and guarded
          against wild beasts, but not buried. a id="noteref_560" name=

          When that
          ceremony was over, the king departed to go to another chief in
          Busiro; but on the way thither he stopped at a place called Baka
          and sat down under a great tree to play a game of spinning
          fruit-stones. It is a children's game, but it was no child's play
          to the man who ran to fetch the fruit-stones for the king to play
          with; for he was caught and speared to death on the spot for the
          purpose of prolonging the king's life. After the game had been
          played the king with his train passed on and lodged with a certain
          princess till the anklets made from the muscles of the chief's

              The whip of human skin.
            
          

          When all these
          ceremonies were over, the king made a great feast. At this feast a
          priest went about carrying under his mantle the whip that had been
          made from the skin of the murdered young man. As he passed through
          the crowd of merrymakers, he would flick a man here and there with
          the whip, and it was believed that the man on whom the lash lighted
          would be childless and might die, unless he made an offering of
          either nine or ninety cowrie shells to the priest who had struck
          him. Naturally he hastened to procure the shells and take them to
          the striker, who, on receiving them, struck the man on the shoulder
          with his hand, thus restoring to him the generative powers of which
          the blow of the whip had deprived him. At the end of the feast the
          drummers removed all the drums but one, which they left as if they
          had forgotten it. Somebody in the crowd would notice the apparent
          oversight and run after the drummers with the drum, saying,
          “You have left one behind.” The
          thanks he received was that he was caught and killed and the bones
          of his upper arm made into drumsticks for that particular drum. The
          drum was never afterwards brought out during the whole of the
          king's reign, but was kept covered up till the time came to bring
          it out on the corresponding feast of his successor. Yet from time
          to time the priest, who had flicked the revellers with the whip of
          human skin, would dress himself up in a mantle of cow-hide from
          neck to foot, and concealing the drumstick of human bones under his
          robe would go into the king's presence, and suddenly whipping out
          the bones from his bosom would brandish them in the king's face.
          Then he would as suddenly hide them again, but only to repeat the
          manoeuvre. After that he retired and restored the bones to their
          usual place. They were decorated with cowrie shells and little
          bells, which jingled as he shook them at the king. a id=

          that just as the human blood poured into a drum was thought to pass
          into the king's veins in the booming notes of the drum, so the
          clicking of the human bones and the jingling of their bells were
          supposed to infuse into the royal person the vigour of the murdered
          man. The purpose of flicking commoners with the whip made of human
          skin is even more obscure; but we may conjecture that the life or
          virility of every man struck with the whip was supposed to be
          transmitted in some way to the king, who thus recruited his vital,
          and especially his reproductive, energies at this solemn feast. If
          I am right in my interpretation, all these Baganda  span class=

          prolonging his life belonged to the nutritive rather than to the
          vicarious type of sacrifice, from which it will follow that they
          were magical rather than religious in character.

          

          
            
              Massacres perpetrated when a king
              of Uganda was ill.
            
          

          The same thing
          may perhaps be said of the wholesale massacres which used to be
          perpetrated when a king of Uganda was ill. At these times the
          priests informed the royal patient that persons marked by a certain
          physical peculiarity, such as a cast of the eye, a particular gait,
          or a distinctive colouring, must be put to death. Accordingly the
          king sent out his catchpoles, who waylaid such persons in the roads
          and dragged them to the royal enclosure, where they were kept until
          the tale of victims prescribed by the priest was complete. Before
          they were led away to one of the eight places of execution, which
          were regularly appointed for this purpose in different parts of the
          kingdom, the victims had to drink medicated beer with the king out
          of a special pot, in order that he might have power over their
          ghosts, lest they should afterwards come back to torment him. They
          were killed, sometimes by being speared to death, sometimes by
          being hacked to pieces, sometimes by being burned alive. Contrary
          to the usual custom of the Baganda, the bodies, or what remained of
          the bodies, of these unfortunates were always left unburied on the
          place of execution. a id="noteref_563" name="noteref_563" href=

          what way precisely the sick king was supposed to benefit by these
          massacres of his subjects does not appear, but we may surmise that
          somehow the victims were believed to give their lives for him or to
          him.

          

          
            
              Yet the sacrifices of children to
              Moloch may be otherwise explained.
            
          

          Thus it is
          possible that in Israel also the sacrifices of children to Moloch
          were in like manner intended to prolong the life of the human king

          substitutes for him or by recruiting his failing energies with
          their vigorous young life. But it is equally possible, and perhaps
          more probable, that the sacrifice of the first-born children was
          only a particular application of the ancient law which devoted to
          the deity the first-born of every womb, whether of cattle or of
          human beings. a id="noteref_564" name="noteref_564" href=

                Theory that the resignation of
                the widowed Flamen Dialis was caused by the pollution of
                death.
              
            

            A different
            explanation of the rule which obliged the Flamen Dialis to resign
            the priesthood on the death of his wife a id="noteref_565" name=

            been suggested by my friend Dr. L. R. Farnell. He supposes that
            such a bereavement would render the Flamen ceremonially impure,

            is true that the ceremonial pollution caused by death commonly
            disqualifies a man for the discharge of sacred functions, but as
            a rule the disqualification is only temporary and can be removed
            by seclusion and the observance of purificatory rites, the length
            of the seclusion and the nature of the purification varying with
            the degree of relationship in which the living stand to the dead.
            Thus, for example, if one of the sacred eunuchs at
            Hierapolis-Bambyce saw the dead body of a stranger, he was
            unclean for that day and might not enter the sanctuary of the
            goddess; but next day after purifying himself he was free to
            enter. But if the corpse happened to be that of a relation he was
            unclean for thirty days and had to shave his head before he might
            set foot within the holy precinct. a id="noteref_567" name=

            Again, in the Greek island of Ceos persons who had offered the
            annual sacrifices to their departed friends were unclean for two
            days afterwards and might not enter a sanctuary; they had to
            purify themselves with water. a id="noteref_568" name=

            the analogy of these and similar cases we should expect to find
            the widowed Flamen temporarily debarred from the exercise of his
            office, not permanently relieved of it.

            

            
              
                Apparent parallel among the
                Todas.
              
            

            However, in
            support of Dr. Farnell's view I would cite an Indian parallel
            which was pointed out to me by Dr. W. H. R. Rivers. Among the
            Todas of the Neilgherry Hills in Southern India the priestly
            dairyman ( span style=
            "font-style: italic">palol) is a sacred personage,
            and his life, like that of the Flamen Dialis, is hedged in by
            many taboos. Now when a death occurs in his clan, the dairyman
            may not attend any of the funeral ceremonies unless he gives up
            office, but he may be re-elected after the second funeral
            ceremonies have been completed. In the interval his place must be
            taken by a man of another clan. Some eighteen or nineteen years
            ago a man named Karkievan resigned the office of dairyman when
            his wife died, but two years later he was re-elected and has held
            office ever since. There have meantime been many deaths in his
            clan, but he has not attended a funeral, and has not therefore
            had to resign his post again. Apparently in old times a more
            stringent rule prevailed, and the dairyman was obliged to vacate
            office whenever a death occurred in his clan. For, according to
            tradition, the clan of Keadrol was divided into its two existing
            divisions for the express purpose of ensuring that there might
            still be men to undertake the office of dairyman when a death
            occurred in the clan, the men of the one division taking office
            whenever there was a death in the other. a id="noteref_571" name=

            At first sight
            this case may seem exactly parallel to the case of the Flamen
            Dialis and the Flaminica on Dr. Farnell's theory; for here there
            can be no doubt whatever that it is the pollution of death which
            disqualifies the sacred dairyman from holding office, since, if
            he only avoids that pollution by not attending the funeral, he is
            allowed at the present day to retain his post. On this analogy we
            might suppose that it was not so much the death of his wife as
            the attendance at her funeral which compelled the Flamen Dialis
            to resign, especially as we know that he was expressly forbidden
            to touch a dead body or to enter the place where corpses were
            burned. a id="noteref_572" name="noteref_572" href=

                But on inspection the analogy
                breaks down.
              
            

            But a closer
            inspection of the facts proves that the analogy breaks down at
            some important points. For though the Flamen Dialis was forbidden
            to touch a dead body or to enter a place where corpses were
            burned, he was permitted to attend a funeral; a id="noteref_573"
            name="noteref_573" href="#note_573"> span class=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">573 so
            that there could hardly be any objection to his attending the
            funeral of [pg
            229]
            his wife. This permission clearly tells against the view that it
            was the mere pollution of death which obliged him to resign
            office when his wife died. Further, and this is a point of
            fundamental difference between the two cases, whereas the Flamen
            Dialis was bound to be married, and married too by a rite of
            special solemnity, a id="noteref_574" name="noteref_574" href=

            there is no such obligation on the sacred dairyman of the Todas;
            indeed, if he is married, he is bound to live apart from his wife
            during his term of office. a id="noteref_575" name="noteref_575"

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">575
            Surely the obligation laid on the Flamen Dialis to be married of
            itself implies that with the death of his wife he necessarily
            ceased to hold office: there is no need to search for another
            reason in the pollution of death which, as I have just shown,
            does not seem to square with the permission granted to the Flamen
            to attend a funeral. That this is indeed the true explanation of
            the rule in question is strongly suggested by the further and
            apparently parallel rule which forbade the Flamen to divorce his
            wife; nothing but death might part them. a id="noteref_576" name=

            the rule which enjoined that a Flamen must be married, and the
            rule which forbade him to divorce his wife, have obviously
            nothing to do with the pollution of death, yet they can hardly be
            separated from the other rule that with the death of his wife he
            vacated office. All three rules are explained in the most natural
            way on the hypothesis which I have adopted, namely, that this
            married priest and priestess had to perform in common certain
            rites which the husband could not perform without his wife. The
            same obvious solution of the problem was suggested long ago by
            Plutarch, who, after asking why the Flamen Dialis had to lay down
            office on the death of his wife, says, amongst other things, that
            “perhaps it is because she performs
            sacred rites along with him (for many of the rites may not be
            performed without the presence of a married woman), and to marry
            another wife immediately  span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            This simple explanation of the rule seems quite sufficient, and
            it would clearly hold good whether I am right or wrong in further
            supposing that the human husband and wife in this case
            represented a divine husband and wife, a god and goddess, to wit
            Jupiter and Juno, or rather Dianus (Janus) and Diana; a id=

            that supposition in its turn might still hold good even if I were
            wrong in further conjecturing that of this divine pair the
            goddess (Juno or rather Diana) was originally the more important
            partner.

            However it is
            to be explained, the Roman rule which forbade the Flamen Dialis
            to be a widower has its parallel among the Kotas, a tribe who,
            like the Todas, inhabit the Neilgherry Hills of Southern India.
            For the higher Kota priests are not allowed to be widowers; if a
            priest's wife dies while he is in office, his appointment lapses.
            At the same time priests “should avoid
            pollution, and may not attend a Toda or Badaga funeral, or
            approach the seclusion hut set apart for Kota

            Jewish priests were specially permitted to contract the pollution

            daughter, and unmarried sister are particularly enumerated; but
            they were forbidden to contract the pollution for strangers.

                The marriage of Orcus.
              
            

            Again, the
            learned Servius, whose commentary on Virgil is a gold mine of
            Roman religious lore, informs us that the pontiffs celebrated the
            marriage of the infernal deity Orcus with very great
            solemnity; a id="noteref_585" name="noteref_585" href=
            "#note_585"> span style=

            for this statement he would seem to have had the authority of the
            pontifical books themselves, for he refers to them in the same
            connexion only a few lines before. As it is in the highest degree
            unlikely that the pontiffs would solemnize any foreign rites, we
            may safely assume that the marriage of Orcus was not borrowed
            from Greek mythology, but was a genuine old Roman ceremony, and
            this is all the more probable because Servius, our authority for
            the custom, has recorded some curious and obviously ancient
            taboos which were observed at the marriage and in the ritual of
            Ceres, the goddess who seems to have been joined in wedlock to
            Orcus. One of these taboos forbade the use of wine, the other
            forbade persons to name their father or daughter. a id=

            More than that he proves conclusively by quotations from Plautus,
            the annalist Cn. Gellius, and Licinius Imbrex that these old
            writers certainly regarded one at least of the pairs (Mars and

            should be dismissed as a late product of the mythical fancy
            working under Greek influence, the same objection can hardly be
            urged against the story of the birth of another Roman king,
            Servius Tullius, who is said to have been a son of the fire-god
            and a slave woman; his mother conceived him beside the royal

            would scarcely be possible to express the physical fatherhood of

            we may suspect that this was an older form of the story than the
            legend which fathered the twins on Mars. Similarly, Caeculus, the
            founder of Praeneste, passed for a son of the fire-god Vulcan. It
            was said that his mother was impregnated by a spark which leaped
            from the fire and struck her as she sat by the hearth. In later
            life, when Caeculus boasted of his divine parentage to a crowd,
            and they refused to believe him, he prayed to his father to give
            the unbelievers a sign, and straightway a lambent flame
            surrounded the whole multitude. The proof was conclusive, and
            henceforth Caeculus passed for a true son of the fire-god. a id=

            Such tales of kings or heroes begotten by the fire-god on mortal
            women appear to be genuine old Italian myths, which may well go
            back far beyond the foundation of Rome to the common fountain of
            Aryan mythology; for the marriage customs observed by various
            branches of the Aryan family point clearly to a belief in the
            power of fire to impregnate women. a id="noteref_606" name=

                We must conclude that the Roman
                gods were thought to be married and to beget children.
              
            

            On the whole,
            if we follow the authority of the ancients themselves, we seem
            bound to conclude that the Roman gods, like those of many other
            early peoples, were believed to be married and to beget children.
            It is true that, compared with the full-blooded gods of Greece,
            the deities of Rome appear to us shadowy creatures, pale
            abstractions garbed in little that can vie with the gorgeous pall
            of myth and story which Grecian fancy threw around its divine
            creations. Yet the few specimens of Roman mythology which have

            writers as to a point of fundamental importance in their own
            religion about which they could hardly be mistaken. It should
            never be forgotten that on this subject the ancients had access

            § 3. Children of Living Parents in
            Ritual.

            

            
              
                Rule of Greek and Roman ritual
                that certain offices could only be held by boys whose parents
                were both alive.
              
            

            But Dr.
            Farnell adduces another argument in support of his view that it
            was the pollution of death which obliged the widowed Flamen
            Dialis to resign the priesthood. He points to what he considers
            the analogy of the rule of Greek ritual which required that
            certain sacred offices should be discharged only by a boy whose
            parents were both alive. a id="noteref_609" name="noteref_609"

            This rule he would explain in like manner by supposing that the
            death of one or both of his parents would render a boy
            ceremonially impure and therefore unfit to perform religious
            functions. Dr. Farnell might have apparently strengthened his
            case by observing that the Flamen Dialis and the Flaminica Dialis
            were themselves assisted in their office, the one by a boy, the
            other by a girl, both of whose parents must be alive. a id=

            "page237">[pg 237] a name="Pg237" id="Pg237" class=

            Flaminica, and their youthful ministers were all rendered
            incapable of performing their sacred duties by the taint or
            corruption of death.

            

            
              
                But the rule which excludes
                orphans from certain sacred offices cannot be based on a
                theory that they are ceremonially unclean through the death
                of their parents.
              
            

            But a closer
            scrutiny of the argument reveals a flaw. It proves too much. For
            observe that in these Greek and Roman offices held by boys and
            girls the disqualification caused by the death of a parent is
            necessarily lifelong, since the bereavement is irreparable.
            Accordingly, if Dr. Farnell's theory is right, the ceremonial
            pollution which is the cause of the disqualification must also be
            lifelong; in other words, every orphan is ceremoniously unclean
            for life and thereby excluded for ever from the discharge of
            sacred duties. So sweeping a rule would at a stroke exclude a
            large, if not the larger, part of the population of any country
            from the offices of religion, and lay them permanently under all
            those burdensome restrictions which the pollution of death
            entails among many nations; for obviously a large, if not the
            larger, part of the population of any country at any time has
            lost one or both of its parents by death. No people, so far as I
            know, has ever carried the theory of the ceremonial pollution of
            death to this extremity in practice. And even if it were supposed
            that the taint wore off or evaporated with time from common folk
            so as to let them go about their common duties in everyday life,
            would it not still cleave to priests? If it incapacitated the
            Flamen's minister, would it not incapacitate the Flamen himself?
            In other words, would not the Flamen Dialis be obliged to vacate
            office on the death of his father or mother? There is no hint in
            ancient writers that he had to do so. And while it is generally
            unsafe to argue from the silence of our authorities, I think that
            we may do so in this case without being rash; for Plutarch not
            only mentions but discusses the rule which obliged the Flamen
            Dialis to resign office on the death of his wife, a id=

            if he had known of a parallel rule which compelled him to retire
            on the death of a parent, he would surely have mentioned it. But
            if the ceremonial pollution which would certainly be caused by
            the death of a parent did not compel the Flamen Dialis to vacate
            office, we may safely conclude that neither did the similar
            pollution caused by the death of his wife. Thus the argument
            adduced by Dr. Farnell in favour of his view proves on analysis
            to tell strongly against it.

            At the time of

            chosen from every tribe assembled at the sanctuary of Dionysus,

            grapes were given to them, and holding them in their hands they
            raced to the sanctuary of Athena Sciras. The winner received and
            drained a cup containing a mixture of olive-oil, wine, honey,
            cheese, and barley-groats. It was necessary that both the parents

            fruits of many kinds, while a chorus sang that the branch bore
            figs, fat loaves, honey, oil, and wine. Thus they went in
            procession to a temple of Apollo, at the door of which the boy
            deposited the holy bough. The ceremony is said to have been

                Boys of living parents employed
                in the rites of the Arval Brothers.
              
            

            The rites thus
            far described, in which boys and girls of living parents took
            part, were clearly ceremonies intended specially to ensure the
            fertility of the soil. This is indicated not merely by the nature
            of the rites and of the prayers or verses which accompanied them,
            but also by the seasons at which they were observed; for these
            were the vintage, the harvest-home, and the beginning of sowing.
            We may therefore compare a custom practised by the Roman Brethren
            of the Ploughed Fields ( span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="la">Fratres
            Arvales), a college of priests whose business it
            was to perform the rites deemed necessary for the growth of the
            corn. As a badge of office they wore wreaths of corn-ears, and
            paid their devotions to an antique goddess of fertility, the Dea
            Dia. Her home was in a grove of ancient evergreen oaks and
            laurels out in the Campagna, five miles from Rome. Hither every
            year in the month of May, when the fields were ripe or ripening
            to the sickle, reaped ears of the new corn were brought and
            hallowed by the Brethren with quaint rites, that a blessing might
            rest on the coming harvest. The first or preliminary consecration
            of the ears, however, took place, not in the grove, but in the
            house of the Master of the Brethren at Rome. Here the Brethren
            were waited upon by four free-born boys, the children of living
            fathers and mothers. While the Brethren reclined on couches, the
            boys were allowed to sit on chairs and partake of the feast, and
            when it was over they carried the rest of the now hallowed corn
            and laid it on the altar. a id="noteref_617" name="noteref_617"

                In fertility rites the
                employment of such children is intelligible on the principle
                of sympathetic magic.
              
            

            In these and
            all other rites intended to ensure the fertility of the ground,
            of cattle, or of human beings, the employment of children of
            living parents seems to be intelligible on the principle of
            sympathetic magic; for such children might be deemed fuller of
            life than orphans, either because they  span class=
            "tei tei-q">“flourished on both sides,” as the Greeks put
            it, or because the very survival of their parents might be taken
            as a proof that the stock of which the children came was vigorous
            and therefore able to impart of its superabundant energy to
            others.

            

            
              
                Sons of living parents employed
                to cut the olive-wreath at Olympia and the laurel-wreath at
                Tempe.
              
            

            But the rites
            in which the children of living parents are required to officiate
            do not always aim at promoting the growth of the crops. At
            Olympia the olive-branches which formed the victors' crowns had
            to be cut from a sacred tree with a golden sickle by a lad whose
            father and mother must be both alive. a id="noteref_618" name=

            Delphi every eighth year a sacred drama or miracle-play was acted
            which drew crowds of spectators from all parts of Greece. It set
            forth the slaying of the Dragon by Apollo. The principal part was
            sustained by a lad, the son of living parents, who seems to have
            personated the god himself. In an open space the likeness of a
            lordly palace, erected for the occasion, represented the Dragon's
            den. It was attacked and burned by the lad, aided by women who
            carried blazing torches. When the Dragon had received his deadly
            wound, the lad, still acting the part of the god, fled far away
            to be purged of the guilt of blood in the beautiful Vale of
            Tempe, where the Peneus flows in a deep wooded gorge between the
            snowy peaks of Olympus and Ossa, its smooth and silent tide
            shadowed by overhanging trees and tall white cliffs. In places
            these great crags rise abruptly from the stream and approach each
            other so near that only a narrow strip of sky is visible
            overhead; but where they recede a little, the meadows at their
            foot are verdant with evergreen shrubs, among which Apollo's own
            laurel may still be seen. In antiquity the god himself, stained
            with the Dragon's blood, is said to have come, a haggard footsore
            wayfarer, to this wild secluded glen and there plucked branches
            from one of the laurels that grew in its green thickets beside
            the rippling river. Some of them he used to twine a wreath for
            his brows, one of them he carried in his hand, doubtless in order
            that, guarded by the sacred plant, he might escape the hobgoblins
            which [pg
            241]
            dogged his steps. So the boy, his human representative, did the
            same, and brought back to Delphi wreaths of laurel from the same
            tree to be awarded to the victors in the Pythian games. Hence the
            whole festival of the Slaying of the Dragon at Delphi went by the
            name of the Festival of Crowning. a id="noteref_620" name=

            From this it appears that at Delphi as well as at Olympia the
            boughs which were used to crown the victors had to be cut from a
            sacred tree by a boy whose parents must be both alive.

            At Thebes a
            festival called the Laurel-bearing was held once in every eight
            years, when branches of laurel were carried in procession to the
            temple of Apollo. The principal part in the procession was taken
            by a boy who held a laurel bough and bore the title of the
            Laurel-bearer: he seems to have personated the god himself. His
            hair hung down on his shoulders, and he wore a golden crown, a
            bright-coloured robe, and shoes of a special shape: both his
            parents must be alive. a id="noteref_621" name="noteref_621"

            may suppose that the golden crown which he wore was fashioned in
            the shape of laurel leaves and replaced a wreath of real laurel.
            Thus the boy with the laurel wreath on his head and the laurel
            bough in his hand would resemble the traditional equipment of
            Apollo when he purified himself for the slaughter of the dragon.
            We may conjecture that at Thebes the Laurel-bearer originally
            personated not Apollo but the local hero Cadmus, who slew the
            dragon and had like Apollo to purify himself for the slaughter.
            The conjecture is confirmed by vase-paintings which represent
            Cadmus crowned with laurel preparing to attack the dragon or
            actually in combat with the monster, while goddesses bend over

                If wreaths were originally
                amulets, we could understand why children of living parents
                were chosen to cut and wear them.
              
            

            Why a boy of
            living parents should be chosen for such an office is not at
            first sight clear; the reason might be more obvious if we
            understood the ideas in which the custom of wearing wreaths and
            crowns had its origin. Probably in many cases wreaths and crowns
            were amulets before they were ornaments; in other words, their
            first intention may have been not so much to adorn the head as to
            protect it from harm by surrounding it with a plant, a metal, or
            any other thing which was supposed to possess the magical virtue
            of banning baleful influences. Thus the Arabs of Moab will put a
            circlet of copper on the head of a man who is suffering from
            headache, for they believe that this will banish the pain; and if
            the pain is in an arm or a leg, they will treat the ailing limb
            in like manner. They think that red beads hung before the eyes of
            children who are afflicted with ophthalmia will rid them of the
            malady, and that a red ribbon tied to the foot will prevent it
            from stumbling on a stony path. a id="noteref_625" name=

            at festivals but on other occasions which to the European might
            seem inappropriate for such gay ornaments. But in truth the
            bright blossoms and verdant foliage are not intended to decorate
            the wearer but to endow him with certain magical virtues, which
            are supposed to inhere in the flowers and leaves. Thus one man
            may be seen strutting about with a wreath of greenery which
            passes round his neck and droops over his shoulders, back, and
            breast. He is not a mere dandy, but a lover who hopes that the
            wreath will work as a charm on a woman's heart. Again, another
            may be observed with a bunch of the red dracaena leaves knotted
            round his neck and the long stalk hanging down his back. He is a
            soldier, and these leaves are supposed to make him invulnerable.
            But if the lover should fail to win the affections of his swarthy
            mistress, if the warrior should be wounded in battle, it never
            occurs to either of them to question the magical virtue of the
            charm; they ascribe the failure either to the more potent charm

            Further, on this hypothesis we may perhaps perceive why children
            of living parents were specially chosen to cut or wear sacred
            wreaths. Since such children were apparently supposed to be
            endowed with a more than common share of vital energy, they might
            be deemed peculiarly fitted to make or wear amulets which were
            designed to protect the wearer from injury and death: the current
            of life which circulated in their own veins overflowed, as it
            were, and reinforced the magic virtue of the wreath. For the same
            reason such children would naturally be chosen to personate gods,
            as they seemingly were at Delphi and Thebes.

            

            
              
                Children of living parents
                acting as priest and priestess of Apollo and Artemis. At Rome
                the Vestals and the Salii must be the children of parents who
                were alive at the date of the election. Children of living
                parents employed in expiatory rites at Rome.
              
            

            At Ephesus, if
            we may trust the evidence of the Greek romance-writer,
            Heliodorus, a boy and girl of living parents used to hold for a
            year the priesthood of Apollo and Artemis respectively. When
            their [pg
            244]
            period of office was nearly expired, they led a sacred embassy to
            Delos, the birthplace of the divine brother and sister, where
            they superintended the musical and athletic contests and laid
            down the priesthood. a id="noteref_628" name="noteref_628" href=

            there is no evidence or probability that a Vestal vacated office

            This alone may suffice to prove that the custom of entrusting
            certain sacred duties to children of living parents was not based
            on any notion that orphans as such were ceremonially unclean.

            as in the case of the Vestals this condition probably only
            applied at the date of their election, for they seem like the
            Vestals to have held office for life. At all events we read of a
            lively old gentleman who still skipped and capered about as a

            escort the images of the gods in their sacred cars, and it was a

            Again, when the Capitol had been sacked and burned by the
            disorderly troops of Vitellius, solemn preparations were made to
            rebuild it. The whole area was enclosed by a cordon of fillets
            and wreaths. Then soldiers chosen for their auspicious names
            entered within the barriers holding branches of lucky trees in
            their hands; and afterwards the Vestal Virgins, aided by boys and

            this ceremony the choice of such children seems to be based on
            the same idea as the choice of such water; for as running water
            is deemed to [pg

            the vital current might be thought to flow without interruption
            in the children of living parents but to stagnate in orphans.
            Hence the children of living parents rather than orphans would
            naturally be chosen to pour the living water over the
            foundations, and so to lend something of their own vitality or
            endurance to a building that was designed to last for ever.

            On the same
            principle we can easily understand why the children of living
            parents should be especially chosen to perform certain offices at
            marriage. The motive of such a choice may be a wish to ensure by
            sympathetic magic the life of the newly wedded pair and of their
            offspring. Thus at Roman marriages the bride was escorted to her
            new home by three boys whose parents were all living. Two of the
            boys held her, and the third carried a torch of buckthorn or

            sends to the bride the wedding cake by the hands of a boy, both

            not to stumble or to injure the cake, for to do either would be a
            very bad omen. He may not enter the bride's house till she has

            threshold of the door, and then both of them, the boy and the

            go in procession to the well or spring from which they are

            drinks of the water from the hollow of her hand, and throws money
            and food into it. Then follows a dance, accompanied by a song,
            round about the spring. Lastly, a lad whose parents are both

            carries it to the house of the bridal pair without speaking a

            In the Somali
            custom just described the part played by the child of living
            parents is unambiguous and helps to throw light on the obscurer
            cases which precede. Such a child is clearly supposed to impart
            the virtue of longevity to the milk of which it partakes, and so
            to transmit it to the newly married pair who afterwards drink of
            the milk. Similarly, we may suppose that in all marriage rites at
            least, if not in religious rites generally, the employment of
            children of living parents is intended to diffuse by sympathy the
            blessings of life and longevity among all who participate in the
            ceremonies. This intention seems to underlie the use which the
            Malagasy make of the children of living parents in ritual. Thus,
            when a child is a week old, it is dressed up in the finest
            clothes that can be got, and is then carried out of the house by
            some person whose parents are both still living; afterwards it is
            brought back to the mother. In the act of being carried out and
            in, the infant must be twice carefully lifted over the fire,
            which is placed near the door. If the child is a boy, the axe,
            knife, and spear of the family, together with any building tools
            that may be in the house, are taken out of it at the same time.
            “The implements are perhaps used chiefly
            as emblems of the occupations in which it is expected the infant
            will engage when it arrives at maturer years; and the whole may
            be regarded as expressing the hopes cherished of his activity,
            wealth, and enjoyments.” a id="noteref_645" name=

            fruitfulness of women, or to avert the danger of death and other
            calamities. Yet it might be a mistake to suppose that this notion
            is always clearly apprehended by the persons who practise the
            customs. In their minds the definite conception of superabundant
            and overflowing vitality may easily dissolve into a vague idea

          III. A Charm To Protect a
          Town.

          

          
            
              The Bechuanas use the hide of a
              sacrificial ox at founding a new town.
            
          

          The tradition
          that a Lydian king tried to make the citadel of Sardes impregnable
          by carrying round it a lion a id="noteref_652" name="noteref_652"
          href="#note_652"> span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">652 may
          perhaps be illustrated by a South African custom. When the
          Bechuanas are about to found a new town, they observe an elaborate
          ritual. They choose a bull from the herd, sew up its eyelids with
          sinew, and then allow the blinded animal to wander at will for four
          days. On the fifth day they track it down and sacrifice it at
          sunset on the spot where it happens to be standing. The carcase is
          then roasted whole and divided among the people. Ritual requires
          that every particle of the flesh should be consumed on the spot.
          When the sacrificial meal is over, the medicine-men take the hide
          and mark it with appropriate medicines, the composition of which is
          a professional secret. Then with one long spiral cut they convert
          the whole hide into a single thong. Having done so they cut up the
          thong into lengths of about two feet and despatch messengers in all
          directions to peg down one of those strips in each of the paths
          leading to the new town. “After
          this,” it is said, “if a foreigner
          approaches the new town to destroy it with his charms, he will find
          that the town has prepared itself for his coming.” a id=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">653 Thus
          it would seem that the pastoral Bechuanas attempt to place a new
          town under the protection of one of their sacred cattle a id=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">654 by
          distributing pieces of its hide at all points where an enemy could
          approach it, just as the Lydian king thought to place the citadel
          of his capital under the protection of the lion-god by carrying the
          animal round the boundaries.

          

          
            
              The custom may explain the legend
              of the foundation of Carthage and similar tales.
            
          

          Further, the
          Bechuana custom may throw light on a widespread legend which
          relates how a wily settler in a new country bought from the natives
          as much land as could be covered with a hide, and how he then
          proceeded to cut the hide into thongs and to claim as much land as
          could be enclosed by the thongs. It was thus,  span class=

          wide diffusion of such stories confirms the conjecture of Jacob
          Grimm that in them we have a reminiscence of a mode of land

          designation is still retained in the English  em class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">659 The
          Bechuana custom suggests that the mode of measuring by a hide may
          have originated in a practice of encompassing a piece of land with
          thongs cut from the hide of a sacrificial victim in order to place
          the ground under the guardianship of the sacred animal.

          

          
            
              The ox whose hide is used is
              blinded in order that the new town may be invisible to its
              enemies.
            
          

          But why do the
          Bechuanas sew up the eyelids of the bull which is to be used for
          this purpose? The answer appears to be given by the ceremonies
          which the same people observe when they are going out to war. On
          that occasion a woman rushes up to the army with her eyes shut and
          shakes a winnowing-fan, while she cries out,  span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The army is not seen! The army is not seen!”
          And a medicine-man at the same time sprinkles medicine over the
          spears, crying out in like manner, “The
          army is not seen! The army is not seen!” After that they
          seize a bull, sew up its eyelids with a hair of its tail, and drive
          it for some distance along the road which the army is to take. When
          it has preceded the army a little way, the bull is sacrificed,
          roasted whole, and eaten by the warriors. All the flesh must be
          consumed on the spot. Such parts as cannot be eaten are burnt with
          fire. Only the contents of the stomach are carefully preserved
          [pg 251] a name=
          "Pg251" id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"> as a charm which is
          to lead the warriors to victory. Chosen men carry the precious guts
          in front of the army, and it is deemed most important that no one
          should precede them. When they stop, the army stops, and it will
          not resume the march till it sees that the men with the bull's guts
          have gone forward. a id="noteref_660" name="noteref_660" href=
          "#note_660"> span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">660 The
          meaning of these ceremonies is explained by the cries of the woman
          and the priest, “The army is not seen! The
          army is not seen!” Clearly it is desirable that the army
          should not be perceived by the enemies until it is upon them.
          Accordingly on the principles of homoeopathic magic the Bechuanas
          apparently imagine that they can make themselves invisible by
          eating of the flesh of a blind bull, blindness and invisibility
          being to their simple minds the same thing. For the same reason the
          bowels of the blind ox are carried in front of the army to hide its
          advance from hostile eyes. In like manner the custom of sacrificing
          and eating a blind ox on the place where a new town is to be built
          may be intended to render the town invisible to enemies. At all
          events the Bawenda, a South African people who belong to the same
          Bantu stock as the Bechuanas, take great pains to conceal their
          kraals from passers-by. The kraals are built in the forest or bush,
          and the long winding footpaths which lead to them are often kept
          open only by the support of a single pole here and there. Indeed
          the paths are so low and narrow that it is very difficult to bring
          a horse into such a village. In time of war the poles are removed
          and the thorny creepers fall down, forming a natural screen or
          bulwark which the enemy can neither penetrate nor destroy by fire.
          The kraals are also surrounded by walls of undressed stones with a
          filling of soil; and to hide them still better from the view of the
          enemy the tops of the walls are sown with Indian corn or planted
          with tobacco. Hence travellers passing through the country seldom
          come across a Bawenda kraal. To see where the Bawenda dwell you
          must climb to the tops of mountains and look down on the roofs of
          their round huts peeping out of the surrounding green like clusters
          of mushrooms in the woods. a id="noteref_661" name="noteref_661"
          href="#note_661"> span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">661 The
          object which the Bawenda attain by these perfectly rational means,
          the Bechuanas seek to compass by the sacrifice and consumption of a
          blind bull.

          

          
            
              This explanation of the use of a
              blinded ox is confirmed by a Caffre custom.
            
          

          This explanation
          of the use of a blinded ox in sacrifice is confirmed by the reasons
          alleged by a Caffre for the observance of a somewhat similar custom
          in purificatory ceremonies after a battle. On these occasions the
          Bechuanas and other Caffre tribes of South Africa kill a black ox
          and cut out the tip of its tongue, an eye, a piece of the
          ham-string, and a piece of the principal sinew of the  span class=

          certain herbs and rubbed into the joints of the warriors. By
          cutting out the tongue of the ox they think to prevent the enemy
          from wagging his tongue against them; by severing the sinews of the
          ox they hope to cause the enemy's sinews to fail him in the battle;
          and by removing the eye of the ox they imagine that they prevent
          the enemy from casting a covetous eye on their cattle. a id=

          IV. Some Customs Of The Pelew
          Islanders.

          We have seen
          that the state of society and religion among the Pelew Islanders in
          modern times presents several points of similarity to the condition
          of the peoples about the Eastern Mediterranean in antiquity. a id=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">663 Here
          I propose briefly to call attention to certain other customs of the
          Pelew Islanders which may serve to illustrate some of the
          institutions discussed in this volume.

          
             

            
            § 1. Priests dressed as
            Women.

            

            
              
                In the Pelew Islands a man who
                is inspired by a goddess wears female attire and is treated
                as a woman. This pretended change of sex under the
                inspiration of a female spirit may explain a widespread
                custom whereby men dress and live like women.
              
            

            In the Pelew
            Islands it often happens that a goddess chooses a man, not a
            woman, for her minister and inspired mouthpiece. When that is so,
            the favoured man is thenceforth regarded and treated as a woman.
            He wears female attire, he carries a piece of gold on his neck,
            he labours like a woman in the taro fields, and he plays his new
            part so well that he earns the hearty contempt of his
            fellows. a id="noteref_664" name="noteref_664" href=
            "#note_664"> span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">664 The
            pretended change of sex under the inspiration of a female spirit
            perhaps explains a custom widely spread among savages, in
            accordance with which some men dress as women and act as women
            through life. These unsexed creatures often, perhaps generally,
            profess the arts of sorcery and healing, they communicate with
            spirits, and are regarded sometimes with awe and sometimes with
            contempt, as beings of a higher or lower order than common folk.
            Often they are dedicated and trained to their vocation from
            childhood. Effeminate sorcerers or priests of this sort are found

            him justice he appears commonly to have taken full advantage of
            this benefit of clergy. When he died, his fortunate successor
            dissected the body of the deceased Grandmother, extracting his
            heart and other vital organs, and amputating his fingers and
            toes, which he kept as priceless relics, and sold as sovereign

                Such transformations seem to
                have been often carried out in obedience to intimations
                received in dreams or in ecstasy. Transformed medicine-men

            We may
            conjecture that in many of these cases the call to this strange
            form of the religious life came in the shape of a dream or
            vision, in which the dreamer or visionary imagined himself to be
            a woman or to be possessed by a female spirit; for with many
            savage races the disordered fancies of sleep or ecstasy are
            accepted as oracular admonitions which it would be perilous to
            disregard. At all events we are told that a dream or a revelation
            of some sort was the reason which in North America these
            men-women commonly alleged for the life they led; it had been
            thus brought home to them, they said, that their medicine or
            their salvation lay in living as women, and when once they had
            got this notion into their head nothing could drive it out again.

            violence, to deter his son from obeying the mysterious call, but

            Among the Sauks, an Indian tribe of North America, these
            effeminate beings were always despised, but sometimes they were
            pitied “as labouring under an unfortunate
            destiny which they cannot avoid, being supposed to be impelled to

            the bow and arrows, thereby fixing his lot in after life. In such

            supposed change of sex. The call to transform himself into a
            woman is said to come as a supernatural command thrice repeated
            in dreams; to disregard the command would mean death. Accordingly
            he makes a feast, sacrifices a pig or two to avert evil
            consequences from the tribe, and then assumes the garb of a
            woman. Thenceforth he is treated as a woman and occupies himself
            in feminine pursuits. His chief aim is to copy female manners and
            habits as accurately as possible. He is employed for the same
            purposes as an ordinary medicine-man and his methods are similar,
            but he is paid much higher fees and is often called in when
            others have been unable to effect a cure. a id="noteref_676"

            Similarly among the Chukchees of North-Eastern Asia there are
            shamans or medicine-men who assimilate themselves as far as
            possible to women, and who are believed to be called to this
            vocation by spirits in a dream. The call usually comes at the
            critical age of early youth when the shamanistic inspiration, as
            it is called, first manifests itself. But the call is much
            dreaded by the youthful adepts, and some of them prefer death to
            obedience. There are, however, various stages or degrees of
            transformation. In the first stage the man apes a woman only in
            the manner of braiding and arranging the hair of his head. In the
            second he dons female attire; in the third stage he adopts as far
            as possible the life and characteristics of the female sex. A
            young man who is undergoing this final transformation abandons
            all masculine occupations and manners. He throws away the rifle
            and the lance, the lasso of the reindeer herdsman, and the
            harpoon of the seal-hunter, and betakes himself to the needle and
            the skin-scraper instead. He learns the use of them quickly,
            [pg 257] a name=
            "Pg257" id="Pg257" class="tei tei-anchor"> because the
            spirits are helping him all the time. Even his pronunciation
            changes from the male to the female mode. At the same time his
            body alters, if not in outward appearance, at least in its
            faculties and forces. He loses masculine strength, fleetness of
            foot, endurance in wrestling, and falls into the debility and
            helplessness of a woman. Even his mental character undergoes a
            change. His old brute courage and fighting spirit are gone; he
            grows shy and bashful before strangers, fond of small talk and of
            dandling little children. In short he becomes a woman with the
            appearance of a man, and as a woman he is often taken to wife by
            another man, with whom he leads a regular married life.
            Extraordinary powers are attributed to such transformed shamans.
            They are supposed to enjoy the special protection of spirits who
            play the part of supernatural husbands to them. Hence they are
            much dreaded even by their colleagues in the profession who
            remain mere men; hence, too, they excel in all branches of magic,

            Among the Teso of Central Africa medicine-men often dress as

            And just as a

            a woman inspired by a god may adopt male costume. In Uganda the

            life dressed like the rest of her sex in a bark cloth wrapped
            round the body and fastened with a girdle, so as to leave the
            arms and shoulders bare; but when she prophesied under the
            inspiration of the god, she wore two bark cloths knotted in

                The theory of inspiration by a

                have been thought to be possessed by the great Asiatic

            mother-kin. Wherever a goddess is revered and the theory of
            inspiration is held, a man may be thought to be possessed by a
            female spirit, whether society be organized on mother-kin or on
            father-kin. Still the chances of such a transformation of sex
            will be greater under mother-kin than under father-kin if, as we

            favourable to the development and multiplication of goddesses
            than of gods. It is therefore, perhaps, no mere accident that we
            meet with these effeminate priests in regions like the Pelew

            actually prevails or has at least left traces of it behind in

                But the exchange of costume
                between men and women has probably been practised also from
                other motives, for example, from a wish to avert the Evil

            women is an obscure and complex problem, and it is unlikely that
            any single solution would apply to all the cases. Probably the
            custom has been practised from many different motives. For

            which he wears are intended to protect the bridegroom against
            demons or the evil eye at this critical moment of his life, the
            protection apparently consisting in a disguise which enables him
            to elude the unwelcome attentions of malignant beings. a id=

                The same explanation may account
                for the interchange of male and female costume between other
                persons at marriage.
              
            

            A similar
            explanation probably accounts for the similar exchange of costume
            between other persons than the bride and bridegroom at marriage.
            For example, after a Bharia wedding, “the
            girl's mother gets the dress of the boy's father and puts it on,
            together with a false beard and moustaches, and dances holding a
            wooden ladle in one hand and a packet of ashes in the other.
            Every time she approaches the bridegroom's father on her rounds
            she spills some of the ashes over him and occasionally gives him
            a crack on the head with her ladle, these actions being
            accompanied by bursts of laughter from the party and frenzied
            playing by the musicians. When the party reach the bridegroom's
            house on their return, his mother and the other women come out,
            and burn a little mustard and human hair in a lamp, the
            unpleasant smell emitted by these articles being considered
            potent to drive away evil spirits.” a id="noteref_702"
            name="noteref_702" href="#note_702"> span class=

            Again, after a Khangar wedding the father of the bridegroom,
            dressed in women's clothes, dances with the mother of the bride,
            while the two throw turmeric mixed with water on each
            other. a id="noteref_703" name="noteref_703" href=

            Similarly after a [pg
            262]
            wedding of the Bharbhunjas, another Hindustani caste of the
            Central Provinces, the bridegroom's father dances before the
            family in women's clothes which have been supplied by the bride's
            father. a id="noteref_704" name="noteref_704" href=

            Such disguises and dances may be intended either to protect the
            disguised dancer himself against the evil eye or perhaps rather
            to guard the principal personages of the ceremony, the bride and
            bridegroom, by diverting the attention of demons from them to the
            guiser. a id="noteref_705" name="noteref_705" href=

            However, when at marriage the bride alone assumes the costume and
            appearance of the other sex, the motive for the disguise may
            perhaps be a notion that on the principle of homoeopathic magic
            she thereby ensures the birth of a male heir. Similarly in Sweden
            there is a popular superstition that “on
            the night preceding her nuptials the bride should have a baby-boy
            to sleep with her, in which case her first-born will be a
            son”; a id="noteref_706" name="noteref_706" href=

            among the Kabyles, when a bride dismounts from her mule at her
            husband's house, a young lad leaps into the saddle before she
            touches the ground, in order that her first child may be a
            boy. a id="noteref_707" name="noteref_707" href=

                Women's dress assumed by men for
                the purpose of deceiving demons and ghosts.
              
            

            Be that as it
            may, there is no doubt that the assumption of woman's dress is
            sometimes intended to disguise a man for the purpose of deceiving
            a demon. Thus among the Boloki or Bangala on the Upper Congo a
            man was long afflicted with an internal malady. When all other
            remedies had failed, a witch-doctor informed the sufferer that
            the cause of his trouble was an evil spirit, and that the best
            thing he could do was to go far away where the devil could not
            get at him, and to remain there till he had recovered his health.
            The patient followed the prescription. At dead of night he left
            his house, taking only two of his wives with him and telling no
            one of his destination, lest the demon should hear it and follow
            him. So he went far away from his town, donned a woman's dress,
            and speaking in a woman's voice he pretended to be other than he
            was, in order that the devil should not be able to find him at
            his new address. Strange to say, these sage measures failed to
            [pg 263] a name=
            "Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"> effect a cure, and
            wearying of exile he at last returned home, where he continued to

            Again, the Kuki-Lushai of Assam believe that if a man kills an
            enemy or a wild beast, the ghost of the dead man or animal will
            haunt him and drive him mad. The only way of averting this
            catastrophe is to dress up as a woman and pretend to be one. For
            example, a man who had shot a tiger and was in fear of being
            haunted by the animal's ghost, dressed himself up in a woman's
            petticoat and cloth, wore ivory earrings, and wound a mottled
            cloth round his head like a turban. Then smoking a woman's pipe,
            carrying a little basket, and spinning a cotton spindle, he
            paraded the village followed by a crowd roaring and shrieking
            with laughter, while he preserved the gravity of a judge, for a
            single smile would have been fatal. To guard against the
            possibility of unseasonable mirth, he carried a porcupine in his
            arms, and if ever, tickled beyond the pitch of endurance, he
            burst into a guffaw, the crowd said, “It
            was the porcupine that laughed.” All this was done to
            mortify the pride of the tiger's ghost by leading him to believe
            that he had been shot by a woman. a id="noteref_709" name=

                Exchange of costume between the
                sexes at circumcision.
              
            

            The same dread
            of attracting the attention of dangerous spirits at critical
            times perhaps explains the custom observed by some East African
            tribes of wearing the costume of the opposite sex at
            circumcision. Thus, when Masai boys have been circumcised they
            dress as women, wearing earrings in their ears and long garments
            that reach to the ground. They also whiten their swarthy faces
            with chalk. This costume they retain till their wounds are
            healed, whereupon they are shaved and assume the skins and
            ornaments of warriors. a id="noteref_710" name="noteref_710"

            Among the Nandi, a tribe of British East Africa, before boys are
            circumcised they receive a visit from young girls, who give them
            some of their own garments and ornaments. These the boys put on
            and wear till the operation of circumcision is over, when they
            exchange the girls' clothes for the garments of women, which,
            together with necklaces, are provided for them by their mothers;
            and these women's garments the newly circumcised lads must
            continue to wear for months afterwards. Girls are also
            circumcised among the Nandi, and before they submit to the
            operation they attire themselves in men's garments and carry
            clubs in their hands. a id="noteref_711" name="noteref_711" href=

            the boys as girls, cut their hair after the girlish fashion, and
            hang necklaces round their necks. On the contrary, when they have

                Conclusion.
              
            

            On the whole
            we conclude that the custom of men dressing as women and of women
            dressing as men has been practised from a variety of
            superstitious motives, among which the principal would seem to be
            the wish to please certain powerful spirits or to deceive
            others.
          

          
             

            
            § 2. Prostitution of Unmarried
            Girls.

            

            
              
                The systematic prostitution of
                unmarried girls for hire in the Pelew Islands seems to be a
                form of sexual communism and of group-marriage.
              
            

            Like many
            peoples of Western Asia in antiquity, the Pelew Islanders
            systematically prostitute their unmarried girls for hire. Hence,
            just as in Lydia and Cyprus of old, the damsels are a source of
            income to their family, and women wait impatiently for the time
            when their young daughters will be able to help the household by
            their earnings. Indeed the mother regularly anticipates the time
            by depriving the girl of her virginity with her own hands. a id=
            "noteref_715" name="noteref_715" href="#note_715"> span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"> span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">715
            Hence the theory that the prostitution of unmarried girls is a
            device to destroy their virginity without risk to their husbands
            is just as inapplicable to the Pelew Islanders as we have seen it
            to be to the peoples of Western Asia in antiquity. When a Pelew
            girl has thus been prepared for her vocation by her mother, she
            sells her favours to all the men of her village who can pay for
            them and who do not belong to her own exogamous clan; but she
            never grants her favours to the same man twice. Accordingly in
            every village of the Pelew Islands it may be taken as certain
            that the men and women know each other carnally, except that
            members of the same clan are debarred from each other by the rule
            of exogamy. a id="noteref_716" name="noteref_716" href=
            "#note_716"> span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">716
            Thus a well-marked form of sexual communism, limited only by the
            exogamous prohibitions which attach to the clans, prevails among
            these people. Nor is this communism restricted to the inhabitants
            [pg 265] a name=
            "Pg265" id="Pg265" class="tei tei-anchor"> of the same
            village, for the girls of each village are regularly sent away to
            serve as prostitutes ( span style=

            There they live with the men of one of the many clubs or
            associations ( span style=

            ( span style=

            consorting freely with the men, and receiving pay for their
            services. A girl leading this life in the clubhouse of another
            village is well treated by the men: a wrong done to her is a
            wrong done to the whole club; and in her own village her value is
            increased, not diminished, by the time she thus spends as a
            prostitute in a neighbouring community. After her period of
            service is over she may marry either in the village where she has
            served or in her own. Sometimes many or all of the young women of
            a village go together to act as prostitutes ( span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"> span style=
            "font-style: italic">armengols) in a neighbouring
            village, and for this they are well paid by the community which
            receives them. The money so earned is divided among the chiefs of
            the village to which the damsels belong. Such a joint expedition
            of the unmarried girls of a village is called a  span class=

                The custom supports by analogy
                the derivation of the similar Asiatic custom from a similar
                state of society.
              
            

            Thus, while
            the Pelew custom of prostituting the unmarried girls to all the
            men of their own village, but not of their own clan, is a form of
            sexual communism practised within a local group, the custom of
            prostituting them to men of other villages is a form of sexual
            communism practised between members of different local groups; it
            is a kind of group-marriage. These customs of the Pelew Islanders
            therefore support by analogy the hypothesis that among the
            ancient peoples of Western Asia also the systematic prostitution
            of unmarried women may have been derived from an earlier period
            of sexual communism. a id="noteref_718" name="noteref_718" href=

                Somewhat similar custom observed
                in Yap, one of the Caroline Islands.
              
            

            A somewhat
            similar custom prevails in Yap, one of the western group of the
            Caroline Islands, situated to the north of the Pelew group. In
            each of the men's clubhouses “are kept

            § 3. Custom of slaying
            Chiefs.

            

            
              
                In the Pelew Islands the heir to
                the chieftainship of a clan has a formal right to slay his
                predecessor.
              
            

            In the Pelew
            Islands when the chief of a clan has reigned too long or has made
            himself unpopular, the heir has a formal right to put him to
            death, though for reasons which will appear this right is only
            exercised in some of the principal clans. The practice of
            regicide, if that word may be extended to the assassination of
            chiefs, is in these islands a national institution regulated by
            exact rules, and every high chief must lay his account with it.
            Indeed so well recognized is the custom that when the
            heir-apparent, who under the system of mother-kin must be a
            brother, a nephew, or a cousin on the mother's side, proves
            himself precocious and energetic, the people say,  span class=
            "tei tei-q">“The cousin is a grown man. The chief's  span class=

                The plot of death and its
                execution.
              
            

            In such cases
            the plot of death is commonly so well hushed up that it seldom
            miscarries. The first care of the conspirators is to discover
            where the doomed man keeps his money. For this purpose an old
            woman will sleep for some nights in the house and make inquiries
            quietly, till like a sleuth-hound she has nosed the hoard. Then
            the conspirators come, and the candidate for the chieftainship
            despatches his predecessor either with his own hand or by the
            hand of a young cousin. Having done the deed he takes possession
            of the official residence, and applies to the widow  span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267] a name="Pg267" id=
            "Pg267" class="tei tei-anchor"> of the deceased the form of
            persuasion technically known as  span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"> span style=
            "font-style: italic">meleket. This consists of
            putting a noose round her neck, and drawing it tighter and
            tighter till she consents to give up her late husband's money.
            After that the murderer and his friends have nothing further to
            do for the present, but to remain quietly in the house and allow
            events to take their usual course.

            

            
              
                Ceremonies observed before the
                assassin is recognized as chief in room of his victim.
              
            

            Meantime the
            chiefs assemble in the council-house, and the loud droning notes
            of the triton-shell, which answers the purpose of a tocsin,
            summon the whole population to arms. The warriors muster, and
            surrounding the house where the conspirators are ensconced they
            shower spears and stones at it, as if to inflict condign
            punishment on the assassins. But this is a mere blind, a sham, a
            legal fiction, intended perhaps to throw dust in the eyes of the
            ghost and make him think that his death is being avenged. In
            point of fact the warriors take good care to direct their
            missiles at the roof or walls of the house, for if they threw
            them at the windows they might perhaps hurt the murderer. After
            this formality has been satisfactorily performed, the regicide
            steps out of the house and engages in the genial task of paying
            the death duties to the various chiefs assembled. When he has
            observed this indispensable ceremony, the law is satisfied: all
            constitutional forms have been carried out: the assassin is now
            the legitimate successor of his victim and reigns in his stead
            without any further trouble.

            

            
              
                But the formalities which a
                chief has to observe at his accession are much more
                complicated and tedious if he has not murdered his
                predecessor.
              
            

            But if he has
            omitted to massacre his predecessor and has allowed him to die a
            natural death, he suffers for his negligence by being compelled
            to observe a long series of complicated and irksome formalities
            before he can make good his succession in the eyes of the law.
            For in that case the title of chief has to be formally withdrawn
            from the dead man and conferred on his successor by a curious
            ceremony, which includes the presentation of a coco-nut and a
            taro plant to the new chief. Moreover, at first he may not enter
            the chief's house, but has to be shut up in a tiny hut for thirty
            or forty days during all the time of mourning, and even when that
            is over he may not come out till he has received and paid for a
            human head brought him by the people of a friendly state. After
            that he still may not go to the sea-shore until more formalities
            have been fully observed. These comprise a very costly fishing
            expedition, which is conducted by the inhabitants of another
            district and lasts for weeks. At the end of it a net full of fish
            is brought to the chief's house, and the people of the
            neighbouring communities are summoned by the blast of trumpets.
            As soon as the stranger fishermen have been publicly paid for
            their services, a relative of the new chief steps across the net
            and solemnly splits a coco-nut in two with an old-fashioned knife
            made of a Tridacna shell, while at the same time he bans all the
            evils that might befall his kinsman. Then, without looking at the
            nut, he throws the pieces on the ground, and if they  span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268] a name="Pg268" id=
            "Pg268" class="tei tei-anchor"> fall so that the two halves
            lie with the opening upwards, it is an omen that the chief will
            live long. The pieces of the nut are then tied together and taken
            to the house of another chief, the friend of the new ruler, and
            there they are kept in token that the ceremony has been duly
            performed. Thereupon the fish are divided among the people, the
            strangers receiving half. This completes the legal ceremonies of
            accession, and the new chief may now go about freely. But these
            tedious formalities and others which I pass over are dispensed
            with when the new chief has proved his title by slaying his
            predecessor. In that case the procedure is much simplified, but
            on the other hand the death duties are so very heavy that only
            rich men can afford to indulge in the luxury of regicide. Hence
            in the Pelew Islands of to-day, or at least of yesterday, the
            old-fashioned mode of succession by slaughter is now restricted
            to a few families of the bluest blood and the longest
            purses. a id="noteref_723" name="noteref_723" href=
            "#note_723"> span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">723

            

            
              
                The Pelew custom shows how
                regicide may be regarded as an ordinary incident of
                constitutional government.
              
            

            If this
            account of the existing or recent usage of the Pelew Islanders
            sheds little light on the motives for putting chiefs to death, it
            well illustrates the business-like precision with which such a
            custom may be carried out, and the public indifference, if not
            approval, with which it may be regarded as an ordinary incident
            of constitutional government. So far, therefore, the Pelew custom
            bears out the view that a systematic practice of regicide,
            however strange and revolting it may seem to us, is perfectly
            compatible with a state of society in which human conduct and
            human life are estimated by a standard very different from ours.
            If we would understand the early history of institutions, we must
            learn to detach ourselves from the prepossessions of our own time
            and country, and to place ourselves as far as possible at the
            standpoint of men in distant lands and distant ages.

          The first series of the texts was discovered in 1880 when
          Mariette's workmen penetrated into the pyramid of King Pepi the
          First. Till then it had been thought by modern scholars that the
          pyramids were destitute of inscriptions. The first to edit the
          Pyramid Texts was Sir Gaston Maspero.

          The birth of the five deities on the
          five supplementary days is mentioned by Diodorus Siculus (i. 13. 4)
          as well as by Plutarch ( span style=
          "font-style: italic">Isis et Osiris, 12). The memory
          of the five supplementary days seems to survive in the modern
          Coptic calendar of Egypt. The days from the first to the sixth of
          Amshir (February) are called “the days
          outside the year” and they are deemed unlucky.  span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Any child begotten during these days will infallibly
          be misshapen or abnormally tall or short. This also applies to
          animals so that cattle and mares are not covered during these days;
          moreover, some say (though others deny) that neither sowing nor
          planting should be undertaken.” However, these unlucky days
          are not the true intercalary days of the Coptic calendar, which
          occur in the second week of September at the end of the Coptic
          year. See C. G. Seligmann, “Ancient

          Plutarch but are known to us from Egyptian sources. The barbarous
          legend of the begetting of Horus by the dead Osiris is told in
          unambiguous language in the Pyramid Texts, and it is illustrated by
          a monument which represents the two sister goddesses hovering in
          the likeness of hawks over the god, while Hathor sits at his head
          and the Frog-goddess Heqet squats in the form of a huge frog at his
          feet. See J. H. Breasted,  span style=

          distinguish him from Horus, says that Harpocrates was begotten by
          the dead Osiris on Isis, and that he was born untimely and was weak
          in his lower limbs ( span style=

          he tells us that Harpocrates “was born,

          early flowers and blossoms” ( span class=

          ‘Opening of the Mouth’ the deceased
          was temporarily placed in a bull's skin, which was probably that of
          one of the bulls which were offered up during the celebration of
          the service. From this skin the deceased obtained further power,

          appears to be now generally held that the original seat of the
          worship of Osiris was at Busiris, but that at Abydos the god found
          a second home, which in time eclipsed the old one in glory.
          According to Professors Ed. Meyer and A. Erman, the god whom Osiris
          displaced at Abydos was Anubis.

          White Crown, worn by Osiris, was the symbol of the king's dominion
          over Upper Egypt; the flat Red Crown, with a high backpiece and a
          projecting spiral, was the symbol of his dominion over Lower Egypt.
          On the monuments the king is sometimes represented wearing a
          combination of the White and the Red Crown to symbolize his
          sovereignty over both the South and the North. White was the
          distinctive colour of Upper, as red was of Lower, Egypt. The
          treasury of Upper Egypt was called “the
          White House”; the treasury of Lower Egypt was called
          “the Red House.” See Ed. Meyer,

          royal clan. This view is rejected by Prof. Ed. Meyer, who, however,
          holds that Horus, whose emblem was the hawk, was the oldest
          national god of Egypt ( span style=

          prefers to suppose that the hawk, or rather the falcon, was the
          emblem of a god of light because the bird flies high in the sky
          (op.
          cit. p. 73; according to him the bird is not the
          sparrow-hawk but the falcon, ib. p. 75). A similar view is adopted
          by Professor A. Wiedemann ( span style=
          "font-style: italic">Religion of the Ancient
          Egyptians, p. 26). Compare A. Erman,  span class=

          According to the legend the four sons
          of Horus were set by Anubis to protect the burial of Osiris. They
          washed his dead body, they mourned over him, and they opened his
          cold lips with their fingers. But they disappeared, for Isis had
          caused them to grow out of a lotus flower in a pool of water. In
          that position they are sometimes represented in Egyptian art before
          the seated effigy of Osiris. See A. Erman,  span class=

          In demotic the fixed Alexandrian year
          is called “the year of the Ionians,”
          while the old movable year is styled “the
          year of the Egyptians.” Documents have been found which are
          dated by the day and the month of both years. See H. Brugsch,

          L. Ideler,  span class=

          cit. i. 149-152. Macrobius thought that the Egyptians
          had always employed a solar year of 365-¼ days ( span class=
          "tei tei-hi">Saturn.
          i. 12. 2, i. 14. 3). The ancient calendar of the Mexicans resembled
          that of the Egyptians except that it was divided into eighteen
          months of twenty days each (instead of twelve months of thirty days
          each), with five supplementary days added at the end of the year.
          These supplementary days ( span class=
          "tei tei-foreign">nemontemi)
          were deemed unlucky: nothing was done on them: they were dedicated
          to no deity; and persons born on them were considered unfortunate.

          calendar, however, the Mexican appears to have been regularly
          corrected by intercalation so as to bring it into harmony with the
          solar year. But as to the mode of intercalation our authorities
          differ. According to the positive statement of Sahagun, one of the
          earliest and best authorities, the Mexicans corrected the
          deficiency of their year by intercalating one day in every fourth
          year, which is precisely the correction adopted in the Alexandrian
          and the Julian calendar. See B. de Sahagun,  span class=

          the falsehood of the view that the bissextile year was unknown to
          the Mexicans. This weighty statement is confirmed by the practice
          of the Indians of Yucatan. Like the Aztecs, they reckoned a year to
          consist of 360 days divided into 18 months of 20 days each, with 5
          days added so as to make a total of 365 days, but every fourth year
          they intercalated a day so as to make a total of 366 days. See

          the Nile rises in Egypt about the summer solstice (June 21) and
          reaches its greatest height by the autumnal equinox (September 22).
          This agrees exactly with the statement of Diodorus Siculus (i. 36.

          (De die
          natali, xxi. 10), Sirius regularly rose in Egypt on
          the twentieth of July (Julian calendar); and this was true of
          latitude 30° in Egypt (the latitude nearly of Heliopolis and
          Memphis) for about three thousand years of Egyptian history. See L.
          Ideler,  span style=

          date of the rising of the star is not the same throughout Egypt; it
          varies with the latitude, and the variation within the limits of
          Egypt amounts to seven days or more. Roughly speaking, Sirius rises
          nearly a whole day earlier for each degree of latitude you go
          south. Thus, whereas near Alexandria in the north Sirius does not
          rise till the twenty-second of July, at Syene in the south it rises
          on the sixteenth of July. See R. Lepsius,  span class=

          that the rising of the Nile, as well as the rising of Sirius, is
          observed earlier and earlier the further south you go. The
          coincident variation of the two phenomena could hardly fail to
          confirm the Egyptians in their belief of a natural or supernatural
          connexion between them.

            proves that, besides the shifting festivals of the shifting
            official year, the Egyptians celebrated other festivals, which
            were dated by direct observation of natural phenomena, namely,
            the annual inundation, the rise of Sirius, and the phases of the
            moon. The same distinction of the fixed from the movable
            festivals is indicated in one of the Hibeh papyri, but the

            The rise of
            Sirius was carefully observed by the islanders of Ceos, in the
            Aegean. They watched for it with arms in their hands and
            sacrificed on the mountains to the star, drawing from its aspect
            omens of the salubrity or unhealthiness of the coming year. The
            sacrifice was believed to secure the advent of the cool North
            winds (the Etesian winds as the Greeks call them), which
            regularly begin to blow about this time of the year, and mitigate
            the oppressive heat of summer in the Aegean. See Apollonius

            the first of Thoth coincided with the heliacal rising of Sirius
            on July 20 (Julian calendar) in the year 139  span class=

            that the civil or vague Egyptian year of 365 days was instituted
            in one of these years. In favour of supposing that it was

             span style=

            that in both these years the rising of Sirius nearly coincided

            solstice, and with it the rising of the Nile, fell nineteen days
            before the rising of Sirius and the first of Thoth. Now when we
            consider the close causal connexion which the Egyptians traced
            between the rising of Sirius and the rising of the Nile, it seems
            probable that they started the new calendar on the first of Thoth
            in a year in which the two natural phenomena coincided rather
            than in one in which they diverged from each other by nineteen
            days. Prof. Ed. Meyer decides in favour of the year 4241

            The period of 1460 solar or 1461 movable Egyptian years was
            variously called a Sothic period (Clement of Alexandria,
             span style=
            "font-style: italic">Strom. i. 21. 136, p. 401 ed.
            Potter), a Canicular year (from  span class=

            "font-style: italic">Canicula,  span class=
            "tei tei-q">“the Dog-star,” that is, Sirius), a heliacal
            year, and a year of God (Censorinus,  span class=
            "tei tei-hi">De die
            natali, xviii. 10). But there is no evidence or
            probability that the period was recognized by the Egyptian
            astronomers who instituted the movable year of 365 days. Rather,
            as Ideler pointed out ( span style=
            "font-style: italic">op. cit. i. 132), it must have
            been a later discovery based on continued observations of the
            heliacal rising of Sirius and of its gradual displacement through
            the whole length of the official calendar. Brugsch, indeed, went
            so far as to suppose that the period was a discovery of
            astronomers of the second century  span class=
            "tei tei-hi"> span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d., to which they were

            fail to be made as soon as astronomers estimated the length of
            the solar year at 365-¼ days, and that they did so at least as
            early as 238  span style=

          Thus with regard to the Egyptian month
          of Athyr he tells us that the sun was then in the sign of the
          Scorpion ( span style=
          "font-style: italic">Isis et Osiris, 13), that Athyr
          corresponded to the Athenian month Pyanepsion and the Boeotian
          month Damatrius ( span style=
          "font-style: italic">op. cit. 69), that it was the
          month of sowing ( span style=
          "font-style: italic">ib.), that in it the Nile sank,
          the earth was laid bare by the retreat of the inundation, the
          leaves fell, and the nights grew longer than the days ( span class=
          "tei tei-hi">op.
          cit. 39). These indications agree on the whole with
          the date of Athyr in the Alexandrian calendar, namely October
          28-November 26. Again, he says ( span class=
          "tei tei-hi">op.
          cit. 43) that the festival of the beginning of spring
          was held at the new moon of the month Phamenoth, which, in the
          Alexandrian calendar, corresponded to February 24-March 26.
          Further, he tells us that a festival was celebrated on the 23rd of
          Phaophi after the autumn equinox ( span class=
          "tei tei-hi">op.
          cit. 52), and in the Alexandrian calendar Phaophi
          began on September 28, a few days after the autumn equinox. Once
          more, he observes that another festival was held after the spring
          equinox ( span style=
          "font-style: italic">op. cit. 65), which implies the
          use of a fixed solar year. See G. Parthey in his edition of

          cit. i. 304. A similar attempt to reform religion by
          diverting the devotion of the people from the spirits of their dead
          appears to have been made in antiquity by the doctors of the
          Persian faith. For that faith “in its most
          finished and purest form, in the  span class=
          "tei tei-hi">Gathas,
          does not recognize the dead as objects worthy of worship and
          sacrifice. But the popular beliefs were too firmly rooted, and the
          Mazdeans, like the sectaries of many other ideal and lofty forms of
          religion, were forced to give way. As they could not suppress the
          worship and get rid of the primitive and crude ideas involved in
          it, they set about the reform in another way: they interpreted the
          worship in a new manner, and thus the worship of the dead became a
          worship of the gods or of a god in favour of the loved and lost
          ones, a pious commemoration of their names and their
          virtues.” See N. Söderblom,  span class=

          So it was reckoned at the time. But,
          strictly speaking, Thoth in that year began on August 31. The
          miscalculation originated in a blunder of the ignorant Roman
          pontiffs who, being charged with the management of the new Julian
          calendar, at first intercalated a day every third, instead of every
          fourth, year. See Solinus,  span style=

            Theoretically
            the shift should have been 40, or rather 42 days, that being the
            interval between July 20 and August 29 or 31 (see the preceding
            note). If that shift was actually made, the calendar date of any
            festival in the old vague Egyptian year could be found by adding
            40 or 42 days to its date in the Alexandrian year. Thus if the
            death of Osiris fell on the 17th of Athyr in the Alexandrian
            year, it should have fallen on the 27th or 29th of Khoiak in the
            old vague year; and if his resurrection fell on the 19th of Athyr
            in the Alexandrian year, it should have fallen on the 29th of
            Khoiak or the 1st of Tybi in the old vague year. These
            calculations agree nearly, but not exactly, with the somewhat
            uncertain indications of the Denderah calendar (above, p.
            88), and also with the
            independent evidence which we possess that the resurrection of
            Osiris was celebrated on the 30th of Khoiak (below, pp.  a href=
            "#Pg108" class="tei tei-ref">108  span class=
            "tei tei-hi">sq.).
            These approximate agreements to some extent confirm my theory
            that, with the adoption of the fixed Alexandrian year, the dates
            of the official Egyptian festivals were shifted from their
            accidental places in the calendar to their proper places in the
            natural year.

            Since I
            published in the first edition of this book (1906) my theory that
            with the adoption of the fixed Alexandrian year in 30
             span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">b.c. the Egyptian
            festivals were shifted about a month backward in the year,
            Professor Ed. Meyer has shown independent grounds for holding
            “that the festivals which gave rise to
            the later names of the (Egyptian) months were demonstrably held a
            month later in earlier ages, under the twentieth, eighteenth,
            indeed partly under the twelfth dynasty; in other words, that
            after the end of the New Kingdom the festivals and the
            corresponding names of the months were displaced one month
            backwards. It is true that this displacement can as yet be proved
            for only five months; but as the names of these months and the
            festivals keep their relative position towards each other, the
            assumption is inevitable that the displacement affected not
            merely particular festivals but the whole system equally.”
            See Ed. Meyer,  span style=
            "font-style: italic">Nachträge zur ägyptischen
            Chronologie (Berlin, 1908), pp. 3  span class=

            "font-style: italic">Abhandlungen der königl. Preuss. Akademie
            der Wissenschaften vom Jahre 1907). Thus it is
            possible that the displacement of the festivals by a month
            backward in the calendar took place a good deal earlier than I
            had supposed. In the uncertainty of the whole question I leave my
            theory as it stood.

          If the results of the foregoing
          inquiry be accepted, the resurrection of Osiris was regularly
          celebrated in Egypt on the 15th of November from the year 30
           span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c. onward, since the
          15th of November corresponded to the 19th of Athyr (the
          resurrection day) in the fixed Alexandrian year. This agrees with
          the indications of the Roman Rustic Calendars, which place the
          resurrection ( span style=
          "font-style: italic">heuresis, that is, the discovery
          of Osiris) between the 14th and the 30th of November. Yet according
          to the calendar of Philocalus, the official Roman celebration of
          the resurrection seems to have been held on the 1st of November,
          not on the 15th. How is the discrepancy to be explained? Th.
          Mommsen supposed that the festival was officially adopted at Rome
          at a time when the 19th of Athyr of the vague Egyptian year
          corresponded to the 31st of October or the 1st of November of the
          Julian calendar, and that the Romans, overlooking the vague or
          shifting character of the Egyptian year, fixed the resurrection of
          Osiris permanently on the 1st of November. Now the 19th of Athyr of
          the vague year corresponded to the 1st of November in the years
          32-35  span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">a.d. and to the 31st of
          October in the years 36-39; and it appears that the festival was
          officially adopted at Rome some time before 65  span class=

          "font-style: italic">sqq.). It is unlikely that the
          adoption took place in the reign of Tiberius, who died in 37
           span style=

          Jud. xviii. 3. 4); hence Mommsen concluded that the
          great festival of Osiris was officially adopted at Rome in the
          early years of the reign of Caligula, that is, in 37, 38, or 39

          Egypt the festivals were still regulated by the old vague year in
          the first century of our era. It cannot, therefore, be reconciled

          Dionysus was torn in pieces at Thebes, the very place of which

          suggests that the human victim was tied or hung to a pine-tree
          before being rent to pieces. We are reminded of the effigy of Attis
          which hung on the sacred pine (above, vol. i. p. 267), and of the
          image of Osiris which was made out of a pine-tree and then buried
          in the hollow of the trunk (below, p. 108). The pine-tree on which
          Pentheus was pelted by the Bacchanals before they tore him limb
          from limb is said to have been worshipped as if it were the god
          himself by the Corinthians, who made two images of Dionysus out of
          it (Pausanias, ii. 2. 7). The tradition points to an intimate
          connexion between the tree, the god, and the human victim.

          me (dated 8th December, 1910) my colleague Professor P. E. Newberry
          tells me that he believes Osiris to have been originally a
          cedar-tree god imported into Egypt from the Lebanon, and he regards
          the  span style=
          "font-style: italic">ded pillar as a lopped
          cedar-tree. The flail, as a symbol of Osiris, he believes to be the

          peasants in Crete to extract the ladanum gum from the shrubs. See

          We may compare a belief of some of the
          Californian Indians that the owl is the guardian spirit and deity
          of the “California big tree,” and
          that it is equally unlucky to fell the tree or to shoot the bird.
          See S. Powers,  span style=
          "font-style: italic">Tribes of California
          (Washington, 1877), p. 398. When a Maori priest desires to protect
          the life or soul ( span style=
          "font-style: italic">hau) of a tree against the
          insidious arts of magicians, he sets a bird-snare in the tree, and
          the first bird caught in the snare, or its right wing, embodies the
          life or soul of the tree. Accordingly the priest recites
          appropriate spells over the bird or its wing and hides it away in
          the forest. After that no evil-disposed magician can hurt the tree,
          since its life or soul is not in it but hidden away in the forest.

          The divine partner of Isis in later times, especially outside of

          "font-style: italic">Asar-Ḥāpi), the sacred Apis bull
          of Memphis, identified after death with Osiris. His oldest
          sanctuary was at Memphis (Pausanias, i. 18. 4), and there was one
          at Babylon in the time of Alexander the Great (Plutarch,
           span style=

           span style=

          or II. built a great and famous temple in his honour at Alexandria,
          where he set up an image of the god which was commonly said to have
          been imported from Sinope in Pontus. See Tacitus,  span class=

          Potter. In after ages the institution of the worship of Serapis was
          attributed to this Ptolemy, but all that the politic Macedonian
          monarch appears to have done was to assimilate the Egyptian Osiris
          to the Greek Pluto, and so to set up a god whom Egyptians and
          Greeks could unite in worshipping. Serapis gradually assumed the
          attributes of Aesculapius, the Greek god of healing, in addition to
          those of Pluto, the Greek god of the dead. See G. Lafaye,

          by Professor J. H. Breasted ( span style=
          "font-style: italic">Development of Religion and Thought in Ancient
          Egypt, pp. 319-343). Amenophis IV. reigned from about
          1375 to 1358  span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c. His new capital,
          Akhetaton, the modern Tell-el-Amarna, was on the right bank of the
          Nile, between Memphis and Thebes. The king has been described as
          “of all the Pharaohs the most curious and
          at the same time the most enigmatic figure.” To explain his
          bodily and mental peculiarities some scholars conjectured that
          through his mother, Queen Tii, he might have had Semitic blood in
          his veins. But this theory appears to have been refuted by the
          discovery in 1905 of the tomb of Queen Tii's parents, the contents
          of which are of pure Egyptian style. See A. Moret,  span class=

          The late eminent scholar C. P. Tiele,
          who formerly interpreted Osiris as a sun-god ( span class=
          "tei tei-hi">History of Egyptian
          Religion, pp. 43  span class=
          "tei tei-hi">sqq.),
          afterwards adopted a view of his nature which approaches more
          nearly to the one advocated in this book. See his  span class=

          Religion im Altertum, i. 35  span class=
          "tei tei-hi">sq.,
          123. Professor Ed. Meyer also formerly regarded Osiris as a
          sun-god; he now interprets him as a great vegetation god, dwelling
          in the depths of the earth and causing the plants and trees to
          spring from it. The god's symbol, the  span class=

          that Osiris was the sun; he now supposes that the deity originally
          personified the Nile. See his  span style=

          relations of Egypt to Byblus were very ancient and close; he even
          suggests that there may have been from early times an Egyptian
          colony, or at all events an Egyptian military post, in the city.
          The commercial importance of Byblus arose from its possession of
          the fine cedar forests on the Lebanon; the timber was exported to
          Egypt, where it was in great demand. See Ed. Meyer,  span class=

          The rule that the grafting of trees should be done at the waxing of
          the moon is laid down by Pliny ( span class=
          "tei tei-hi">Nat.
          Hist. xvii. 108). At Deutsch-Zepling in Transylvania,
          by an inversion of the usual custom, seed is generally sown at the
          waning of the moon (A. Heinrich,  span class=

          Gebräuche unter den Sachsen Siebenbürgens,
          Hermannstadt, 1880, p. 7). Some French peasants also prefer to sow
          in the wane (F. Chapiseau,  span style=
          "font-style: italic">Folk-lore de la Beauce et du
          Perche, Paris, 1902, i. 291). In the Abruzzi also
          sowing and grafting are commonly done when the moon is on the wane;
          timber that is to be durable must be cut in January during the
          moon's decrease (G. Finamore,  span style=

            lead primitive man to trace the growth of plants to the influence

            Payne suggests that the custom of naming the months after the
            principal natural products that ripen in them may have
            contributed to the same result. The custom is certainly very
            common among savages, as I hope to show elsewhere, but whether it
            has contributed to foster the fallacy in question seems
            doubtful.

            The Indians of
            Brazil are said to pay more attention to the moon than to the
            sun, regarding it as a source both of good and ill. See J. B. von

          Flinders Petrie. That the festival occurred, theoretically at
          least, at intervals of thirty years, appears to be unquestionable;
          for in the Greek text of the Rosetta Stone Ptolemy V. is called
          “lord of periods of thirty years,”
          and though the corresponding part of the hieroglyphic text is lost,
          the demotic version of the words is “master
          of the years of the Sed festival.” See R. Lepsius,

            In support of the view that the king of Egypt was deemed to be
            born again at the Sed festival it has been pointed out that on
            these solemn occasions, as we learn from the monuments, there was
            carried before the king on a pole an object shaped like a
            placenta, a part of the human body which many savage or barbarous
            peoples regard as the twin brother or sister of the new-born
            child. See C. G. Seligmann and Margaret A. Murray,  span class=

             span style=
            "font-style: italic">Man, xi. (1911) pp. 165-171.
            The object which these writers take to represent a human placenta
            is interpreted by M. Alexandre Moret as the likeness of a human
            embryo. As to the belief that the afterbirth is a twin brother or
            sister of the infant, see above, vol. i. p. 93, and below, pp.

            Professor J.
            H. Breasted thinks that the Sed festival is probably  span class=
            "tei tei-q">“the oldest religious feast of which any trace has
            been preserved in Egypt”; he admits that on these
            occasions “the king assumed the costume
            and insignia of Osiris, and undoubtedly impersonated him,”
            and further that “one of the ceremonies
            of this feast symbolized the resurrection of Osiris”; but
            he considers that the significance of the festival is as yet
            obscure. See J. H. Breasted,  span class=

          note that the most common name for the Supreme Being on the Congo

          Africa reaching from 6° north of the Equator away to extreme South

          the principal Creator of the world, and the Maker of all things....
          But the Supreme Being is believed by the natives to have withdrawn
          Himself to a great distance after performing His creative works;
          that He has now little or no concern in mundane affairs; and
          apparently no power over spirits and no control over the lives of
          men, either to protect them from malignant spirits or to help them
          by averting danger. They also consider the Supreme Being
          ( span style=

          kind that there is no need to appease Him by rites, ceremonies or

          This consideration is rightly urged by

          King Khent. See H. Schäfer,  span style=

          One of the commonest and oldest titles
          of Osiris was Chent (Khent)-Ament or Chenti (Khenti)-Amenti, as the
          name is also written. It means “Chief of
          those who are in the West” and refers to the Egyptian belief
          that the souls of the dead go westward. See R. V. Lanzone,

          gods of Abydos, and was certainly connected with the dead, being
          probably the ancient local god of the dead of Abydos and its
          neighbourhood. Now, in the Pyramid Texts, which were written under
          the VIth dynasty, there are several mentions of Khenti-Amenti, and
          in a large number of instances the name is preceded by that of
          Osiris. It is quite clear, therefore, that the chief attributes of
          the one god must have resembled those of the other, and that Osiris
          Khenti-Amenti was assumed to have absorbed the powers of
          Khenti-Amenti. In the representations of the two gods which are
          found at Abydos there is usually no difference, at least not under
          the XVIIIth and XIXth dynasties” (E. A. Wallis Budge,
          op.
          cit. i. 31). However, it would be unsafe to infer
          that the resemblance between the name of the god and the name of
          the king is more than accidental.

          J. Kubary,  span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Die Religion der Pelauer,” in A. Bastian's
          Allerlei
          aus Volks- und Menschenkunde (Berlin, 1888), i.
          20-22. The writer says that the family or clan gods of the Pelew
          Islanders are too many to be enumerated, but he gives as a specimen
          a list of the family deities of one particular district
          (Ngarupesang). Having done so he observes that they are all
          goddesses, and he adds that “this is
          explained by the importance of the woman for the clan. The deity of
          the mother is inherited, that of the father is not”
          (op.
          cit. p. 22). As he says nothing to indicate that the
          family deities of this particular district are exceptional, we may
          infer, as I have done, that the deities of all the families or
          clans are goddesses. Yet a few pages previously (pp. 16
           span style=
          "font-style: italic">sq.) he tells us that a village
          which contains twenty families will have at least forty deities, if
          not more, “for some houses may have two
           span style=
          "font-style: italic">kalids [deities], and every
          house has also a goddess.” This seems to imply that the
          families or clans have gods as well as goddesses. The seeming
          discrepancy is perhaps to be explained by another statement of the
          writer that “in the family only the
           span style=

          count” (“ span lang="de" class=

          The Lycians traced their descent
          through women, not through men; and among them it was the
          daughters, not the sons, who inherited the family property. See

          Inscriptions found at Dalisandos, in Isauria, seem to prove that it

          testimony to the existence of a true gynaecocracy in ancient Egypt,
          I am of opinion that the alleged superiority of the queen to the
          king and of the wife to her husband must have been to a great
          extent only nominal. Certainly we know that it was the king and not
          the queen who really governed the country; and we can hardly doubt

          This is in substance the explanation
          which Miss Rachel Evelyn White (Mrs. Wedd) gives of the Egyptian

          Egypt,”  span style=
          "font-style: italic">Journal of Hellenic Studies,
          xviii. (1898) p. 265. Similarly Mr. J. Nietzold observes that
          “economical considerations, especially in
          the case of great landowners, may often have been the occasion of
          marriages with sisters, the intention being in this way to avoid a
          division of the property” ( span class=
          "tei tei-hi">Die Ehe in
          Ägypten, p. 13). The same explanation of the custom
          has been given by Prof. W. Ridgeway. See his  span class=

          understand from Professor W. M. Flinders Petrie that the theory has
          been a commonplace with Egyptologists for many years. McLennan
          explained the marriage of brothers and sisters in royal families as
          an expedient for shifting the succession from the female to the
          male line; but he did not extend the theory so as to explain

          their husbands in the performance of sacred rites is mentioned by
          Dionysius of Halicarnassus, who attributes the institution of these

          The epithet Dialis, which was applied
          to the Flaminica as well as to the Flamen (Aulus Gellius, x. 15.
          26; Servius, on Virgil,  span style=
          "font-style: italic">Aen. iv. 137), would of itself
          prove that husband and wife served the same god or pair of gods;
          and while the word was doubtfully derived by Varro from Jove
          (De
          lingua Latina, v. 84), we are expressly told that the
          Flamen was the priest and the Flaminica the priestess of that god
          (Plutarch,  span style=

          accept the statement of Plutarch ( span class=

          who says that “Orcus was obviously one of
          those old Roman gods who occupied the thoughts of the people in the

          supposes that Orcus is merely a borrowed form of the Greek Horkos

          und Kultus der Römer, span class=
          "tei tei-hi">2 p.
          310). But Horkos was not a god of death and the dead; he was simply
          a personified oath (ὅρκος; see Hesiod,  span class=

          Days, 804 Ὅρκον γεινόμενον, τὸν Ἔρις τέκε πῆμ᾽

          mythology and religion. That such a rare and thin Greek abstraction
          should through a gross misunderstanding be transformed into a
          highly popular Roman god of death, who not only passed muster with
          the people but was admitted by the pontiffs themselves to the
          national pantheon and honoured by them with a solemn ritual, is in
          the last degree improbable.

            only to prove that the Romans commonly applied the titles
            “father” and  span class=
            "tei tei-q">“mother” to their deities. The inference that
            these titles implied paternity or maternity is my own, but in the
            text I have given some reasons for thinking that the Romans
            themselves accepted the implication. Mr. W. Warde Fowler, on the
            other hand, prefers to suppose that the titles were employed in a
            merely figurative sense to “imply the
            dependence of the human citizen upon his divine
            protector”; but he admits that what exactly the Romans
            understood by  span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la">pater and
            mater applied
            to deities is not easy to determine ( span class=
            "tei tei-hi">The Religious
            Experience of the Roman People, pp. 155-157). He
            makes at the same time the important observation that the Romans
            never, so far as he is aware, applied the terms Father and Mother
            to foreign gods, but “always to
            di indigetes,
            those on whom the original Roman stock looked as their
            fellow-citizens and guardians.” The limitation is
            significant and seems more naturally explicable on my hypothesis
            than on that of my learned friend.

          On an Etruscan mirror the scene of Cadmus's combat with the dragon
          is surrounded with a wreath of laurel (O. Crusius,  span class=
          "tei tei-hi">op.
          cit. ii. 862). My learned friend Mr. A. B. Cook was
          the first to call attention to these vase-paintings in confirmation
          of my view that the Festival of the Laurel-bearing celebrated the
          destruction of the dragon by Cadmus. See A. B. Cook,  span class=

          I have examined both festivals more
          closely in a former part of this work ( span class=
          "tei tei-hi">The Dying
          God, pp. 78  span style=
          "font-style: italic">sqq.), and have shown grounds
          for holding that the old octennial cycle in Greece, based on an
          attempt to harmonize solar and lunar time, gave rise to an
          octennial festival at which the mythical marriage of the sun and
          moon was celebrated by the dramatic marriage of human actors, who
          appear sometimes to have been the king and queen. In the
          Laurel-bearing at Thebes a clear reference to the astronomical
          character of the festival is contained in the emblems of the sun,
          moon, stars, and days of the year which were carried in procession
          (Proclus,  span style=
          "font-style: italic">l.c.); and another reference to
          it may be detected in the legendary marriage of Cadmus and
          Harmonia. Dr. L. R. Farnell supposes that the festival of the
          Laurel-bearing “belongs to the maypole
          processions, universal in the peasant-religion of Europe, of which
          the object is to quicken the vitalizing powers of the year in the
          middle of spring or at the beginning of summer”
          (The
          Cults of the Greek States, iv. 285). But this
          explanation appears to be inconsistent with the octennial period of
          the festival.

          We may conjecture that the Olympic,
          like the Delphic and the Theban, festival was at first octennial,
          though in historical times it was quadrennial. Certainly it seems
          to have been based on an octennial cycle. See the Scholiast on

          The Pythian games, which appear to have been at first identical

          mention these cases because they seem to conflict with the theory

          amulets to protect the wearer against ghosts and the pollution of
          blood.

          Wherever men regularly dress as women, we may suspect that a
          superstitious motive underlies the custom even though our
          authorities do not mention it. The custom is thus reported among
          the Italmenes of Kamtschatka (G. W. Steller,  span class=
          "tei tei-hi">Beschreibung von dem
          Lande Kamtschatka, Frankfort and Leipsic, 1774, pp.

          sometimes dress like women and consort and work with them (T. H.
          Lewin,  span style=
          "font-style: italic">l.c.), but, on the other hand,
          women sometimes dress and live like men, adopting masculine habits
          in all respects. When one of these unsexed women was asked her
          reasons for adopting a masculine mode of life, she at first denied
          that she was a woman, but finally confessed  span class=

          For this information I have to thank

          tradition Mukasa used to give his oracles by the mouth of a man,
          not of a woman. To wear two bark cloths, one on each shoulder, is a
          privilege of royalty and of priests. The ordinary man wears a
          single bark cloth knotted on one shoulder only. With the single
          exception mentioned in the text, women in Uganda never wear bark
          cloths fastened over the shoulders.

          In Cyprus there was a bearded and

          Elsewhere I have conjectured that the
          wearing of female attire by the bridegroom at marriage may mark a
          transition from mother-kin to father-kin, the intention of the
          custom being to transfer to the father those rights over the
          children which had previously been enjoyed by the mother alone. See

                that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

              Project Gutenberg™

              Project
              Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
              electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
              computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new
              computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of
              volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.

              Volunteers
              and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance
              they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s goals
              and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain
              freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
              Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a
              secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
              generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
              Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help,

              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.

              The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit  a href=

              "tei tei-xref">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

              While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.

              
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.

              Please check
              the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods
              and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways
              including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

              General Information About Project
              Gutenberg™ electronic works.

               span class=
              "tei tei-name">Professor Michael S. Hart is the
              originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of
              electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For
              thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™
              eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

              Project
              Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
              editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
              U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
              necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
              edition.

              Each eBook
              is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook
              number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
              compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

              Corrected
               span style=
              "font-style: italic">editions of our eBooks replace
              the old file and take over the old filename and etext number.
              The replaced older file is renamed.  em class=

              "font-style: italic">Versions based on separate
              sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and
              etext numbers.
