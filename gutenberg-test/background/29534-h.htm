<p><i>Dear Sir</i>&mdash;Along with this I send you the first installment of the
papers, entitled "The Myxomycetes of the Miami Valley, Ohio."</p>

<p>The work in these papers is based upon my ample collection of
Myxomycetes growing in this region, comprising more than one hundred
species; these have been diligently compared with specimens obtained
from correspondents elsewhere in this country and in Europe.</p>

<p>At the same time, I have also included many extra limital species. This
has been done chiefly to more clearly elucidate the subject in places
where the local material is not sufficient.</p>

<p>The only apology I can make for the arrangement which I present, is that
I have been obliged to choose from several different systems. I have
aimed not to hamper myself, by attaching paramount importance to some
particular character throughout.</p>

<p>I purpose to furnish a synopsis of the whole at the end of the work.</p>

<p>

<h2><a name="MYXOMYCETES_Wallr" id="MYXOMYCETES_Wallr"></a>MYXOMYCETES, Wallr.</h2>


<p>Fructification essentially a minute membranaceous vesicle, the
SPORANGIUM inclosing the SPORES, the product of a motile protoplasmic
body called the PLASMODIUM.</p>

<p>Microscopic organisms with the habit of the Fungi. The ripe spore of the
Myxomycetes is globose or ellipsoidal in shape, with the epispore
colorless or colored, and smooth or marked by characteristic
surface&mdash;sculpture according to the species; the spore in germination
gives rise to an elongated protoplasmic body, which exhibits amoeboid
movements, and is known by the name of <i>swarm-cell</i>. The swarm-cells
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>multiply by bipartition, which may be repeated through several
generations; they then unite together to form the large motile
protoplasmic bodies named <i>plasmodia</i>. The newly-formed plasmodium is
distinguished by its greater size from the swarm-cells, while it
exhibits essentially the same movements and changes of shape. The
plasmodia gradually increase in size, and as they grow assume commonly
the form of branched strands; these spread over the surface of the
substratum, which is usually the decaying parts of plants, in the form
of veins and net-works of veins, giving rise to a copiously-branched
reticulated or frill-like expansion, which covers surfaces varying in
extent from a few to several centimeters. They are chiefly composed of a
soft protoplasm of the consistence of cream, which may be readily spread
out into a shapeless smear, and is usually colorless, but sometimes
exhibits brilliant colors of yellow, orange, rose, purple, etc. The
development of the plasmodium ceases with the formation of the <i>spores</i>
within their <i>sporangia</i>.</p>

<p>The formation of the sporangia out of the plasmodium appears under three
general forms, which, however, pass into each other and are, therefore,
not strictly limited.</p>

<p><i>First:</i> An entire plasmodium spread out on its substratum becomes
transformed into a sporangium, or it divides into a variable number of
unequal and irregular pieces, each of which undergoes transformation.
Such a sporangium lying flat on the substratum, more or less elongated
and flexuous, often branched and reticulate, is termed a
<i>plasmodiocarp</i>.</p>

<p><i>Second:</i> Erect sporangia on a narrow or stalk-like base, begin as
node-like swellings on the branches of the plasmodium, and gradually
rise to their ultimate form as the surrounding protoplasm flows into
them and assumes an upward direction. These sporangia are nearly always
perfectly regular in shape; they may be globose, obovoid, somewhat
depressed, or more or less elongated, and are either stipitate or
sessile.</p>

<p><i>Third:</i> A number of plasmodia collect together from every side and
become fused into a single body, often of considerable dimensions; from
these combinations originate the large spore-receptacles which are
called <i>æthalia</i>. The component sporangia may be regular in shape,
standing close together, in a single stratum, with entire connate walls;
more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> often, being elongated and flexuous, they branch and anastomose
freely, their walls becoming perforated and more or less defective; in
other cases, the æthalium is a compound plasmodiocarp, the narrow
sinuous sporangia branched and anastomosing in all directions, forming
an intricate network, closely packed together and inseparable. The
surface of the æthalium is often covered by a continuous layer of some
excreted substance, which is called the <i>common cortex</i>.</p>

<p>The wall of the sporangium, typically, is a thin, firm membrane,
colorless and pellucid, or colored in various shades of violet, brown,
yellow, etc.; it is sometimes extremely delicate, as in Lamproderma, or
is scarcely evident, as in Stemonitis; in other instances it is
thickened by deposits on the inner surface, as in Tubulina, or by
incrustations on the outer surface, as in Chondrioderma. The stipes are
tubes usually with a thick wall, which is often wrinkled and folded
lengthwise, and is confluent above with the wall of the sporangium; in
some cases the stipe also enters the sporangium, and is more or less
prolonged within it as a <i>columella</i>. The stipe commonly expands at the
base into a membrane, which fastens it to the substratum, and is called
the <i>hypothallus</i>; when all the stipes of the same group of sporangia
stand upon a single continuous membrane, it is called a <i>common
hypothallus</i>.</p>

<p>In the simplest forms, the cavity of the sporangium is filled
exclusively with the numerous spores; but in most all of the genera,
tubules or threads of different forms occur among the spores and
constitute the <i>capillitium</i>. The capillitium first makes its appearance
in Reticularia, in which upon the inner surface of the walls of the
sporangia there are abundant fibrous thickenings; next in Cribraria it
is spread over the inner surface of the wall, and is early separated
from it; here, also, it first assumes a more definite form and
arrangement; in Physarum it is in connection with the wall of the
sporangium only by its extremities while it traverses the interior with
a complicated network; in Stemonitis and its allies the capillitium
originates wholly from the columella; in most species of Arcyria it
issues from the interior of the stipe. The capillitium in Trichia
consists of numerous slender threads which are <i>free</i>, that is, are not
attached in any way; they are usually simple and pointed at each
extremity; the surface of these threads exhibits beautiful spiral
markings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>Sporangia always sessile, simple and regular or plasmodiocarp, sometimes
united into an æthalium. The wall a thin, firm, persistent membrane,
often granulose-thickened, usually rupturing irregularly. Spores
globose, usually some shade of umber or olivaceous, rarely violaceous.</p>

<p>The species of this order are the simplest of the Myxomycetes; the
sporangium, with a firm, persistent wall contains only the spores. There
is no trace of a capillitium, unless a few occasional threads in the
wall of Tubulina prefigure such a structure. To the genera of this order
is appended the anomalous genus Lycogala, which seems to me better
placed here than elsewhere.</p>

prismatic, distinct or more or less connate and æthalioid, seated upon a
common hypothallus.</li>

<li>3. <span class="smcap"><ins title="Lycogola in original">Lycogala</ins>.</span> Æthalium with a firm membranaceous wall; from the inner
surface of the wall proceed numerous slender tubules, which are
intermingled with the spores.</li>
</ul>

<p class="break">I. LICEA, Schrad. Sporangia sessile, simple and regular or
plasmodiocarp, gregarious, close or scattered; hypothallus none; the
wall a thin, firm membrane, sometimes thickened with scales or granules,
breaking up irregularly and falling away or dehiscent in a regular
manner. Spores globose, variously colored.</p>

<p>The sporangia are not seated on a common hypothallus; they are,
consequently, more or less irregularly scattered about on the
substratum.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">1. Licea variabilis</span>, Schrad. Plasmodiocarp not much elongated, usually
scattered, sometimes closer and confluent, somewhat depressed, the
surface uneven or a little roughened and not shining, reddish-brown or
blackish in color; the wall a thin, firm pellucid membrane, covered by a
dense outer layer of thick brown or blackish scales, rupturing
irregularly. Spores in mass pale ochraceous, globose or oval, even or
nearly so, 13&ndash;16 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old wood. Plasmodiocarp 1&ndash;1.5 mm. in length, though sometimes
confluent and longer. The wall is thick and rough, not at all shining.
It is evidently the species of Schweinitz referred to by Fries under
this name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">2. Licea Lindheimeri</span>, Berk. Sporangia sessile, regular, globose,
gregarious, scattered or sometimes crowded, dark bay in color, smooth
and shining; the wall a thin membrane with a yellow-brown outer layer,
opaque, rupturing irregularly. Spores in mass bright bay, globose,
minutely warted, opaque, 5&ndash;6 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on herbaceous stems sent from Texas. Sporangia about .4 mm. in
diameter. The bright bay mass of spores within will serve to distinguish
the species. The thin brown wall appears dark bay with the inclosed
spores.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">3. Licea biforis</span>, Morgan, n. sp. Sporangia regular, compressed, sessile
on a narrow base, gregarious; the wall thin, firm, smooth, yellow-brown
in color and nearly opaque, with minute scattered granules on the inner
surface, at maturity opening along the upper edge into two equal parts,
which remain persistent by the base. Spores yellow-brown in mass,
globose or oval, even, 9&ndash;12 mic. in diameter. <a href="#i019">See Plate III, Fig. 1.</a></p>

<p>Growing on the inside bark of Liriodendron. Sporangia .25-.40 mm. in
length, shaped exactly like a bivalve shell and opening in a similar
manner. I have also received specimens of this curious species from
Prof. J. Dearness, London, Canada.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">4. Licea Pusilla</span>, Schrad. Sporangia regular, sessile, hemispheric, the
base depressed, gregarious, chestnut-brown, shining; the wall thin,
smooth, dark-colored and nearly opaque, dehiscent at the apex into
regular segments. Spores in the mass blackish-brown, globose, even,
16&ndash;18 mic. in diameter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>Growing on old wood, Sporangium about 1 mm. in diameter. On account of
the color of the spores the genus <i>Protoderma</i> was created for this
species by Rostafinski. It is number 2,316 of Schweinitz's N. A. Fungi.</p>


<p class="break">II. TUBULINA. Pers. Sporangia cylindric, or by mutual pressure becoming
prismatic, distinct or more or less connate and æthalioid, the apex
convex, seated upon a common hypothallus; the wall a thin membrane,
minutely granulose, firm and quite persistent, gradually breaking away
from the apex downward. Spores abundant, globose, umber or olivaceous.</p>

<p>The sporangia usually stand erect in a single stratum, with their walls
separate or grown together: in the more compact æthalioid forms,
however, the sporangia, becoming elongated and flexuous, pass upward and
outward in various directions, branching and anastomosing freely. <a href="#i019">See
Plate III, Figs. 2, 3, 4.</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">1. Tubulina cylindrica</span>, Bull. Sporangia cylindric, more or less
elongated, closely crowded, distinct or connate, pale umber to
rusty-brown in color, seated on a well developed hypothallus; the wall
thin, firm, with minute veins and granules, semi-opaque, pale umber,
often iridescent. Spores in mass pale umber to rusty-brown, globose,
most of the surface reticulate, 6&ndash;8 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old wood, mosses, etc. Æthalium circular or irregular in
shape, from one to several centimeters in extent, the individual
sporangia 2&ndash;4 mm. in height. Plasmodium at first milky-white, soon
changing to bright red, then to umber, becoming paler when mature and
dry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">2. Tubulina casparyi</span>, Rost. Sporangia more or less elongated, closely
crowded and prismatic, connate, pale umber to brown in color, seated on
a conspicuous hypothallus; the wall thin, firm, minutely granulose,
semi-opaque, pale umber, iridescent when well matured; all or many of
the sporangia traversed by a central columella, from which a few narrow
bands of the membrane stretch to the adjacent walls. Spores in the mass
pale umber to brown, globose, the surface reticulate, 7&ndash;9 mic. in
diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old prostrate trunks. Æthalium two or three to several
centimeters in extent, the individual sporangia 3&ndash;5<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> mm. in height.
Plasmodium white, the immature sporangia dull-gray tinged with sienna
color. The columella, with its radiating bits of membrane, is the same
substance as the wall; it may be a reëntrant edge of the prismatic
sporangium, caused by excessive crowding together; at least, this may be
regarded as its origin; there may have arisen some further adaptation.
The species is <i>Siphoptychium Casparyi</i>, Rost. I am indebted to Dr.
George A. Rex for the specimens I have examined.</p>

<p class="break">III. LYCOGALA. Mich. Æthalium with a firm membranaceous wall; from the
inner surface of the wall proceed numerous slender tubules, which are
intermingled with the spores. The material of the wall appears under
three different forms: the inner layer is a thin membrane, uniform in
structure, of a yellow-brown color, and semi-pellucid; the outer layer
consists of large flat roundish or irregular vesicles, brown in color,
filled with minute granules, and arranged in one or more strata; from
these vesicles originate the tubules, which traverse the wall for a
certain distance, and then enter the interior among the spores; the
tubules are more or less compressed, simple or branched, and the surface
is ornamented with warts and ridges, which sometimes form irregular
rings and reticulations.</p>

<p>If the sporophores in this genus be regarded as simple sporangia, which
is the view that Rostafinski takes of one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> the species, the tubules
are simply the peculiar threads of a capillitium. If, however, the
æthalium is a compound plasmodiocarp, the tubules stand for the original
plasmodial strands and, consequently, represent the component sporangia.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Lycogala conicum</span>. Pers. Æthalia small, ovoid-conic, gregarious,
sometimes close together with the bases confluent, the surface pale
umber or olivaceous marked with short brown lines, regularly dehiscent
at the apex. The wall thin; the outer layer not continuous, the
irregular brown vesicles disposed in angular patches and elongated
bands, which have a somewhat reticulate arrangement. The tubules appear
as a thin stratum upon the inner membrane; they do not branch, and they
send long slender simple extremities inward among the spores. Spores in
mass pale ochraceous, globose, minutely warted, 5&ndash;6 mic. in diameter.
<a href="#i019">See Plate III, Fig. 5.</a></p>

<p>Growing on old wood. Æthalium 2&ndash;5 mm. in height, the tubules 3&ndash;8 mic. in
thickness. This is <i>Dermodium conicum</i> of Rostafinski's monograph, but
the structure is essentially the same as in the other species. Massee
evidently did not have specimens of this species. I have never seen any
branching of the tubules either in the wall or in the free extremities
of the interior.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Lycogala exiguum</span>, Morg. n. sp. Æthalia small, globose, gregarious,
the surface dark brown or blackish, minutely scaly, irregularly
dehiscent. The wall thin; the vesicles with a dark polygonal outline,
disposed in thin irregular reticulate patches, which are more or less
confluent. The tubules appear as an interwoven fibrous stratum upon the
inner membrane; they send long slender branched extremities inward among
the spores. Spores in mass pale ochraceous, globose, nearly smooth, 5&ndash;6
mic. in diameter. <a href="#i019">See Plate III, Fig. 6.</a></p>

<p>Growing on old wood. Æthalium 2&ndash;5 mm. in diameter, the threads 2&ndash;10 mic.
in thickness, with very slight thickenings of the membrane. The
polygonal vesicles give a reticulate appearance to the dark-brown
patches which ornament the surface of the wall.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Lycogala epidendrum</span>, Buxb. Æthalia subglobose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> gregarious, sometimes
closely crowded and irregular, the surface umber, brown or olivaceous,
minutely warted, at length, irregularly dehiscent at or about the apex.
The wall thick, the brown vesicles loosely aggregated and densely
agglutinated together, traversed in all directions by the much-branched
tubules, which send long-branched extremities inward among the spores;
the main branches thick and flat, with wide expansions, especially at
the angles, the ultimate branchlets more slender and obtuse at the apex.
Spores in the mass from pale to reddish ochre, globose, minutely warted,
5&ndash;6 mic. in diameter. <a href="#i019">See Plate III, Fig. 7.</a></p>

<p>Growing on old wood. Æthalium 5&ndash;12 mm. in diameter, the width of the
tubules varying from 12&ndash;25 mic. in the main branches, with broader
expansions at the angles, to 6&ndash;12 mic. in the more slender final
branchlets. This is one of the most common of the Myxomycetes; it grows
in all countries, and in this region may be found on old trunks at all
seasons of the year.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Lycogala flavofuscum</span>, Ehr. Æthalia large, subglobose or somewhat
pulvinate, solitary or gregarious, the surface at first silvery-shining,
becoming yellow-brown, minutely areolate, irregularly dehiscent. The
wall very thick and firm, hard and rigid; the thick outer layer of
roundish brown vesicles closely compacted in numerous strata; from the
vesicles of the lower strata the long and broad much-branched tubules
proceed into the interior among the spores; the ultimate branchlets
clavate and obtuse at the apex. Spores in the mass pale ochre, cinerous
or brownish, globose, minutely warted, 5&ndash;6 mic. in diameter. <a href="#i019">See Plate
III, Figs. 8, 9.</a></p>

<p>Growing on old trunks. Æthalium 1 to several centimeters in diameter,
the width of the tubules varying from 25&ndash;60 mic. in the main branches,
with sometimes much broader expansions at the angles, to 10&ndash;25 mic. in
the ultimate branchlets. The brown vesicles of the outer wall are easily
separated from each other and emptied of their contents by maceration;
it is then seen that a thin pellucid membrane incloses numerous roundish
granules, much resembling the spores, but usually a little larger, 5&ndash;8
mic. in diameter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>Sporangia simple, regular and stipitate, or compound, forming an
æthalium; the wall a thin membrane with distinct fibrous thickenings
upon the inner surface, the membrane, or at least certain portions of
it, disappearing usually at the maturity of the spores, leaving behind
the more permanent fibrous thickenings as a more or less definite
capillitium. Spores globose, purple, brown, ochraceous, rarely
violaceous.</p>

<p>In this order the threads of a capillitium first make their appearance;
but they are confined to the inner surface of the wall of the
sporangium, being set at liberty by the early decay of the outer
membrane.</p>

branches coherent at the surface, and naked or covered by an additional
corticate layer. Walls of the sporangia consisting of a thin membrane,
with abundant fibrous thickenings, presenting broad expansions,
narrowing to thin flat bands, and reduced in many places to slender
fibrous threads. Spores abundant, globose, umber or violaceous.</p>

<p>After the maturity of the spores disintegration of the sporangial wall
begins, the thin membrane disappearing more rapidly than the fibrous
thickenings or the portions of the sporangial walls near the base, which
are more compactly grown together; there is thus left at each stage an
increasing number of the shreddy fibers mingled with the spores.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Reticularia Splendens</span>, Morg. n. sp. Æthalium pulvinate, circular or
more or less elongated and irregular, seated on a conspicuous silvery
hypothallus; the surface naked, bright umber, smooth and shining. Walls
of the sporangia firm and quite persistent, pale umber, slowly
disintegrating, consisting for the most part of wide expansions, with
their angles tapering to narrow bands and slender threads. Spores in the
mass pale umber, globose, most of the surface reticulate, 7&ndash;9 mic. in

rozeana</i>, Rost., but it varies greatly from the account given of that
species in the Journal of Botany for September, 1891.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Reticularia Umbrina.</span> Fr. Æthalium pulvinate, roundish, more or less
irregular, the surface covered by a thin, silvery, shining, common

<p>Growing on old trunks. Æthalium one to several centimeters in extent,
and 5&ndash;15 mm. in thickness. The walls of the sporangia are much more
reduced to the shreddy fibrous condition than in the preceding species,
and on this account they much more rapidly disintegrate, causing the
æthalium soon to collapse. It is <i>Reticularia Lycoperdon</i>, Bull.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Reticularia atra</span>, A. &amp; S. Æthalium pulvinate, variable in form and

the sporangia violaceous, next the base with broad expansions, in places
more thickly grown together, toward the surface becoming narrow with
more abundant fibrous threads, sometimes presenting a loose irregular
network, the whole structure, however, quite variable, according to the
stage of the disintegration. Spores globose, violet, minutely warted,
14&ndash;16 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on wood and bark, especially of pine. Æthalium 2 or 3 to several
centimeters in extent. This is <i>Amaurochæte atra</i> of Rostafinski's
monograph, but the structure appears to be altogether similar to that of
<i>Reticularia umbrina</i>.</p>


<p class="break">II. CLATHROPTYCHIUM, Rost. Æthalium composed of numerous regular erect
sporangia, seated in a single compact stratum, on a well-developed
hypothallus, the surface formed by the coherent apices. Sporangia at
first cylindric, with the apex convex and the wall entire; soon, by
mutual pressure, they become prismatic and the lateral faces disappear,
leaving the edges and the apex permanent. Spores globose, ochraceous.</p>

lateral faces disappear, leaving at the edges six simple triangular
threads, extending from the angles of the hexagonal apex downward to the
base. Spores in the mass ochraceous, yellowish or brownish, globose,

sporangia nearly 1 mm. in height, but scarcely .1 mm. in thickness.
Deviations from the typical form of the sporangia sometimes occur, they
are not seldom pentangular, and I have seen the apices quadrangular,
with only four threads, or even triangular, and with but three; the
threads, too, are said occasionally to branch and anastomose.

<p class="break">III. CRIBRARIA, Pers. Sporangia simple, globose or obovoid, stipitate,
often cernuous; the wall regularly thickened on the inner surface in two
ways, the lower basal portion by radiating ribs consisting of minute
brown granules, the upper part by slender threads combined into a
network of polygonal meshes; the basal portion of the membrane is
commonly persistent with its thickening and is called the <i>calyculus</i>,
the upper part nearly always disappears from the network at maturity;
there are usually nodules of the brown granules at the angles of the
network. Spores globose, purple, brown, ochraceous.</p>

hypothallus; the wall quite firm, silvery-shining, the greater portion
persistent, breaking away about the apex; calyculus small, the brown
radiating ribs soon passing into a network of polygonal meshes, the
threads with irregular granulose-thickened portions at intervals
throughout their whole extent. Stipe very short, erect, brown. Spores in
the mass argillaceous, globose, 5&ndash;7 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing in large irregular patches on rotten trunks. Sporangia .6-.8 mm.

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Cribraria vulgaris</span>, Schrad. Sporangium large, globose, stipitate,
somewhat cernuous; the calyculus brown, finely ribbed and granulose
within, occupying but a small part of the sporangium; the network of
slender threads, with very small nodules at the angles, each with
several (3&ndash;7) radiating threads, sometimes with one or two free
extremities, the meshes triangular or rhombic. Stipe rather short,
stout, tapering upward, usually a little bent or curved at the apex,
dark purplish brown in color. Spores in the mass pale ochraceous,
globose, even, 5&ndash;7 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old wood. Sporangium .5-.7 mm. in diameter, the stipe two or
three times the diameter of the sporangium in length. Recognized by the
large sporangium and the very small nodules with their few radiating
threads.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Cribraria dictydioides</span>, C. &amp; B. Sporangium large, globose, stipitate,
cernuous; the calyculus small, with thickish brown ribs, from which the
outer thin membrane often disappears soon after maturity; the network of
slender threads, with large brown nodules at the angles, more or less
elongated and irregular in shape, each with numerous (5&ndash;15) radiating
threads, usually some with free extremities, the meshes largely
triangular. Stipe long, tapering upward, flexuous, curved at the apex,
dark purplish-brown in color. Spores in mass pale ochraceous, globose,

triangular or quadrilateral meshes, and with large irregular dark
copper-colored nodules, each having several (4&ndash;7) radiating threads,

basal portion of the membrane sometimes persists as a calyculus, the
upper part disappears at maturity. Spores globose; purplish.</p>

<p>The ribs run from base to apex like the meridians on a globe; they are

<p class="break">III. TRICHIA, Haller. Sporangia regular and stipitate or sessile and
somewhat irregular; the wall, at maturity, irregularly ruptured. The
stipe more or less elongated or often wanting, usually resting on a
hypothallus. Capillitium consisting of numerous short slender tubules,
called <i>elaters</i>, intermingled with the spores and wholly free; elaters
simple or rarely branched a time or two, each extremity terminating in a
smooth tapering point; the spiral ridges parallel and conspicuous, 2&ndash;5
in number, smooth or spinulose. Spores globose, yellow, ochraceous,
olivaceous.</p>

<p>The genus Trichia is unique among the Myxomycetes in having its
capillitium composed of tubules, which are entirely free from the wall
of the sporangium. The length of these free tubes varies usually between
.3 mm. and .5 mm., being sometimes shorter, but seldom longer; they are
typically cylindric, or equally thickened from end to end, or quite
rarely they are thickened in the middle, and taper gradually to each
extremity; the extremities terminate in a smooth tapering point,
straight or sometimes a little curved or flexuous, which maintains an
average length in each species. The spiral ridges wind around the thread
almost invariably to the left, or with the hands of a watch; they are
always more or less prominent and conspicuous, and usually maintain a
regular curve and uniform interval between each other in the same
species; their surface is either smooth, or sometimes it is invested
with minute warts or spinules.</p>

<p>In all the species of this genus, however, irregular and abnormal
elaters are occasionally met with among the typical ones. As these
abnormal forms always arrest attention, and have been conceived to
possess specific value, it may be well to note the principal of them.</p>

<p>1. The elater is sometimes branched. In two or three species the
branching appears to be quite regular and not abnormal; still, even in
these species, most of the elaters in the sporangia are not branched. In
some cases the branching arises from confluence of two or more elaters.</p>

<p>2. Ellipsoidal swellings, or enlargements of the elater, sometimes
occur, at one or both extremities, or at points intermediate between
them; these always occur irregularly, and are essentially abnormal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>3. The smooth tapering point is rarely wanting, in which case the
extremity presents a blunt end, the spiral ridges running to the end.
More frequently the tapering points are multiplied, the elaters bearing
two or three spines at the extremities; this often occurs in the species
of Trichia, and also of Hemiarcyria with spinulose elaters.</p>

<p>4. The spiral ridges are sometimes defective, there being less than the
typical number; sometimes they are merely displaced, there being a much
wider interval between them than usual; rarely do they habitually wind
about the thread in an irregular manner.</p>

<p>5. Under high magnifying power, fine ridges are sometimes seen running
lengthwise of the elaters, bridging the intervals between the spirals.
These were first observed by DeBary, in <i>Trichia chrysosperma</i>, but they
have since been seen in the elaters of nearly every other species of
Trichia, and also in species of Hemiarcyria.</p>

<p>The few species with elaters, so far as yet known, habitually irregular,
defective and abnormal, are referred to the genus Oligonema.</p>

<p>The normal species of Trichia arrange themselves quite naturally into
three sections.</p>

<p>Sporangia globose or ovoid to oblong and cylindrical, stipitate; the
wall very thin and fragile, soon disappearing. Stipe tapering upward and
continued within the sporangium as a more or less elongated columella.
Capillitium of slender brown threads, arising from numerous points of
the columella, repeatedly branching and usually anastomosing to form a
network, persistent and rigidly preserving the outline of the
sporangium. Spores globose, brown or violaceous.</p>

<p>This order is readily distinguished by the brown persistent capillitium,
arising from a lengthened columella, and rigidly maintaining the form of
the sporangium.</p>

<p class="break">I. CLASTODERMA, Blytt. Sporangium regular, globose, stipitate; the wall
very thin and fragile. Stipe elongated, tapering upward, entering the
sporangium as a very short or nearly obsolete columella. Capillitium
arising by a few branches from the apex of the columella, these branches
forking several times at a sharp angle, but not combined into a network,
the ultimate branchlets long and free, or only connected together at
their tips by persistent fragments of the sporangial wall. Spores
globose, violaceous.</p>

<p>The claim of this genus to be distinguished from Lamproderma must rest
upon the fact that the branchlets of the capillitium do not anastomose
and form a network. It is the same as the genus Orthotricha of Wingate.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Clastoderma De Baryanum</span>, Blytt. Sporangium very small, globose; the
wall early disappearing, except the minute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> fragments which persist at
the extremities of the capillitium, and a narrow collar at the base of
the columella. Stipe very long, thick and brown below, tapering upward
to a pellucid oblong swelling, thence abruptly narrowed to the apex; the
columella extremely short, capillitium of very slender pale-brown
semi-pellucid threads, divergently forking, the ultimate branchlets
often joined 2&ndash;4 together at their tips by fragments of the sporangial
wall. Spores globose, even, violaceous, 8&ndash;9 mic. in diameter. <a href="#i077">See Plate
XI, Fig. 25.</a></p>

<p>Growing in rather a scattered way on old rotten wood. Sporangium .20-.25
mm. in diameter, the stipe .7&ndash;1.3 mm. long. <i>Orthotricha microcephala</i>,
Wingate. Blytt's species was found in Norway, Wingate's in Pennsylvania;
I have met with it several times in this locality. It is possibly more
common than it appears, as by reason of the difficulty of seeing the
minute sporangium it is passed by as some mold. Blytt's spore
measurements are 9.5&ndash;11 mic.; in some specimens I have seen a few spores
of this size, but they are abnormal.</p>


<p class="break">II. LAMPRODERMA, Rost. Sporangia regular, globose, stipitate; the wall
thin and fragile, rugulose, shining with metallic tints, breaking up
irregularly and gradually falling away. Stipe more or less elongated,
smooth, brown or black in color, arising from a hypothallus, tapering
upward and entering the sporangium as a short columella scarcely
reaching the center. Capillitium of numerous threads radiating from the
columella, usually forking several times and combined into a net by
lateral anastomosing branchlets. Spores globose, brown or violaceous.</p>

<p>Lamproderma is distinguished by the shining metallic tints of the
sporangial wall, and by the short columella scarcely reaching half the
height of the sporangium.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Lamproderma physaroides</span>, A. &amp; S. Sporangium globose; the wall with a
silvery metallic luster, at length breaking up and falling away. Stipe
long, slender, brown or blackish, arising from a small circular
hypothallus; columella clavate, obtuse, not reaching the center of the
sporangium. Cap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>illitium of brownish-violet threads, arising from the
upper part of the columella; these branch repeatedly at a sharp angle,
form an intricate network of elongated meshes, terminating at the wall
in numerous short free branchlets. Spores globose, minutely warted,
bright brown, 12&ndash;14 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old wood, moss, etc., New York, <i>Chas. H. Peck</i>.
Distinguished by the pale silvery sporangial wall and the clear brown
spores.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Lamproderma arcyrionema</span>, Rost. Sporangium small, globose; the wall
dark bronze, with a silvery sheen when loosened from the spores, soon
breaking into scales and falling away. Stipe long and slender, smooth,
shining and black, rising from a thin hypothallus; the columella short
cylindric, variable in length, but not attaining the center of the
sporangium. Capillitium arising by division of the apex of the columella
into several primary branches; these immediately separate into numerous
slender flexuous brown threads, which unite and form a dense network of
small arcuate meshes, the ultimate branchlets not free. Spores globose,
even, violaceous, 6&ndash;7 mic. in diameter. <a href="#i077">See plate XI, Fig. 26.</a></p>

<p>Growing on old wood of Juglans and Carya. Sporangium .3-.5 mm. in
diameter, the stipe three or four times as long. The columella is
somewhat variable, it sometimes forks or divides immediately on entering
the sporangium, at other times it is longer and cylindric, with more
slender primary branches. The meshes of the capillitium resemble those
of Arcyria, whence the name. This is the <i>Stemonitis physaroides</i>, A. &amp;
S. var. <i>sub&oelig;neus</i> of Lea's Catalogue.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Lamproderma violaceum</span>, Fr. Sporangium depressed-globose, convex above
and more or less flattened and umbilicate beneath; the wall shining with
steel or violet, blue and purple tints, deciduous. Stipe short, stout,
brown or blackish in color, arising from a thin, brown, common
hypothallus; columella cylindric, or tapering slightly to an obtuse
apex, attaining the center of the sporangium. Capillitium of numerous
slender threads, radiating from the upper part of the columella; these
threads are brown below, with a vari<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>able outer portion colorless; they
branch a few times and form an interior network of elongated meshes,
outwardly arching and freely anastomosing they give rise to an external
network of small irregular meshes, they then attain the wall by
innumerable short, simple, or forked free branchlets. Spores globose,
minutely spinulose, violaceous, 9&ndash;11 mic. in diameter. <a href="#i077">See plate XI, Fig
27.</a></p>

<p>Growing on old wood, mosses, etc., late in Autumn. Sporangium .5-.8 mm.
in diameter, the stipe about the same length. The capillitium is
sometimes most of it colorless and flaccid; sometimes it is all brown
and rigid except the minute free extremities.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Lamproderma arcyrioides</span>, Somm. Sporangium globose or ellipsoid, and
somewhat elongated; the wall with tints of violet, purple, and blue,
deciduous. Stipe usually short, or sometimes nearly obsolete, brown or
blackish in color, arising from a strongly-developed hypothallus; the
columella cylindric or slightly tapering upward, and obtuse, reaching
nearly to the center of the sporangium. Capillitium of numerous
pale-brown threads, radiating from the apex of the columella; these fork
directly from the base, are bent and flexuous, and are combined into a
dense, intricate net, with abundant free extremities. Spores globose,
spinulose, violaceous, 13&ndash;16 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old leaves, wood, etc. Sporangium .5-.8 mm. in diameter, the
stipe variable in length from very short to 1 mm. long or beyond.
<i>Lamproderma columbinum</i>, Pers. is a doubtful species, the forms of that
name being easily distributed between the present species and <i>L.
physaroides</i>.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Lamproderma scintillans</span>, B. &amp; Br. Sporangium globose; the wall
shining with colors of blue, purple, and bronze, deciduous. Stipe long,
slender, smooth, and shining, brown or blackish, rising from a thin,
brown, common hypothallus; columella cylindric or slightly tapering to
the obtuse apex, not reaching the center of the sporangium. Capillitium
of numerous brown threads, originating about the apex of the columella;
these fork several times, with few anastomosing branchlets, and
terminate at the wall in long, free extremities. Spores globose,
minutely warted, violaceous, 7&ndash;9 mic. in diameter. <a href="#i077">See Plate XI, Fig.
28.</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>Growing on old leaves, moss, etc., in early Spring. Sporangium .3-.5 mm.
in diameter, the stipe from once to twice as long. This is <i>Lamproderma
irideum</i> of Massee's Monograph. I am indebted to Arthur Lister, Esq., of
London, for the identification of my specimens with <i><ins title="Stermonitis in original">Stemonitis</ins>
scintillans</i>, B. &amp; Br., and with <i>Lamproderma irideum</i>, Cke.</p>


<p class="break">III. COMATRICHA, Preuss. Sporangia various in shape, from globose or
ovoid to oblong and cylindric, stipitate; the wall very thin and
fugacious. Stipe more or less elongated, smooth and black, arising from
a common hypothallus, tapering upward, entering the sporangium and
prolonged nearly or quite to the apex as a columella. Capillitium
arising from numerous points of the columella throughout its entire
length; the threads immediately branching and anastomosing to form an
interior network, attaining the wall by numerous more or less elongated
free extremities. Spores globose, brown or violaceous.</p>

<p>This genus is not sharply limited from Stemonitis. The species with very
short free ends, and consequently with superficial meshes approximate to
the wall, are near the form of Stemonitis. But it may be observed that
in these species, the meshes of the capillitium become smaller gradually
outward, the sides of the superficial meshes are arched away from the
wall, and they are in contact with it only by the free extremities.</p>

<p>§1. <span class="smcap">Typhoides.</span> Threads of the capillitium repeatedly branching and
anastomosing, to form a dense network of small meshes, with innumerable

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Comatricha typhina</span>, Roth. Sporangia short, erect or a little curved,
cylindric or usually narrowing slightly upward, the base quite blunt,
the apex more rounded, growing together on a thin hypothallus. Stipe and
columella brown or blackish, tapering upward and vanishing near the apex
of the sporangium, the stipe much shorter than the columella.
Capillitium of slender flexuous tawny-brown threads; these branch
repeatedly, forming an intricate network of small irregular meshes,
ending in very short free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> extremities. Spores globose, violaceous, very
minutely warted, 6&ndash;8 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old wood, mosses, etc. Sporangium with the stipe 2&ndash;4 mm. in
height, the stipe much the shorter, the sporangium .35-.40 mm. in
thickness. <i>Stemonitis typhoides</i>, Fries, S. M.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Comatricha æqualis</span>, Pk. Sporangia usually more or less inclined or
curved and nodding, cylindric, obtuse at each end, growing together on a
thin hypothallus. Stipe and columella slender, smooth, black, extending
nearly or quite to the apex of the sporangium, the stipe longer than the
columella. Capillitium of very slender flexuous tawny-brown threads;
these branch repeatedly, forming an intricate network of small irregular
meshes, ending in very short free extremities. Spores globose, minutely
warted, dark violaceous, 7&ndash;9 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old wood. Sporangium 1.5&ndash;3 mm. in height by .35-.40 mm. in
thickness, the stipe usually about the same length as the sporangium,
but sometimes nearly twice as long. The capillitium is rather looser
than in <i>C. typhina</i>, whence the drooping habit. Peck, Thirty-first
Report, p. 42.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Comatricha nigra</span>, Pers. Sporangia globose or ovoid to ellipsoid or
oblong, erect or sometimes inclined or even nodding. The stipe very
long, smooth and black, tapering upward, expanding at the base into a
small circular hypothallus; the columella short, reaching from one-half
to three-fourths the height of the sporangium. Capillitium of slender
flexuous brown threads, which branch repeatedly, forming a dense
intricate network of small meshes, ending in very short free
extremities. Spores globose, even, dark violaceous, 8&ndash;10 mic. in
diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old wood, leaves, etc. Sporangium .5&ndash;1.5 mm. in height, .5-.8
mm. in diameter, the stipe 1.5&ndash;3 mm. long or sometimes considerably
longer. This species seems to be rare in this country. I have preferred
the name adopted by Schroeter to Rostafinski's <i>Comatricha Friesiana</i>.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Comatricha Ellisii</span>, Morgan, n. sp. Sporangia short, erect, oval or

capillitium toward the apex of the sporangium, the stipe usually longer
than the columella. Capillitium of slender pale brown threads; these
branch several times with lateral anastomosing branchlets, forming a
rather open network of small meshes, ending with very short free
extremities. Spores globose, even, pale ochraceous, 6&ndash;7 mic. in
diameter. <a href="#i077">See Plate XI, Fig. 29.</a></p>

<p>Growing on old pine wood. Sporangium .3-.6 mm. in height by .3-.5 mm. in
width, the stipe usually a little longer than the sporangium. This
elegant little species I have from Mr. J. B. Ellis, of Newfield, N. J.
It is said to be mingled in some of the specimens with <i>Lamproderma
Ellisiana</i>, Cke.</p>

<p>§2. <span class="smcap">Larvella.</span> Threads of the capillitium branching a few times and
anastomosing to form a network of large meshes, attaining the wall by
numerous long, free extremities.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Comatricha crypta</span>, Schw. Sporangia cylindric, bent or flexuous and
more or less inclined, growing close together on a conspicuous
purplish-brown hypothallus. Stipe and columella smooth and black,
tapering upward and reaching the apex of the sporangium, the columella
bent and flexuous or spirally twisted, about as long as the stipe.
Capillitium composed of irregular, bent and uneven threads, which are
brown below, becoming colorless outwardly; the threads branch a few
times, forming a network of large irregular meshes, sometimes much
defective; the free extremities irregular and unequal, simple or
branched. Spores globose, brown, minutely warted, 7&ndash;9 mic. in diameter.
<a href="#i077">See Plate XI, Fig. 30.</a></p>

<p>Growing out of fissures of the bark and wood of Hickory, Acer, etc.
Sporangium with the stipe 4&ndash;7 mm. in height, the stipe a little shorter,
or sometimes much longer than the sporangium, the latter .25-.30 mm. in
thickness. The exterior colorless portion of the capillitium is
exceedingly delicate, easily breaking away and leaving the capillitium
quite irregular and defective. <i>Stemonitis crypta</i>, Schweinitz's N. A.
Fungi, 2351. <i>Comatricha irregularis</i>, Rex, is the same thing.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">Comatricha cæspitosa</span>, Sturgis. Sporangia short, clavate, densely
crowded or cæspitose upon a delicate hypothallus; the wall
subpersistent, silvery, shining with tints of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> purple and blue. Stipe
very short or nearly obsolete, the columella rising to two-thirds or
three-fourths the height of the sporangium. Capillitium of slender
dark-brown threads, which branch and anastomose quite irregularly,
forming a network of intermingled large and small meshes, ending in
long, tapering, free extremities. Spores globose, minutely spinulose,
dark violaceous, 10&ndash;12 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on moss and lichens, at Wood's Holl, Massachusetts. Sporangium
1&ndash;1.5 mm. in height, the stipe very short or sometimes apparently
wanting. I am indebted to Dr. W. C. Sturgis, of New Haven, Conn., for a
specimen of this unique species.</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap">Comatricha longa</span>, Peck. Sporangia very slender and much elongated,
tapering gradually upward, weak and prostrate or pendulous, growing
close together on a well-developed purplish-black hypothallus. Stipe and
columella capillary, smooth and black, reaching to the apex of the
sporangium or often vanishing in the network far below it, the stipe
very short, the columella long and flexible. Capillitium of long,
slender, dark-brown threads; these are reticulately connected near the
base, forming a network of large irregular meshes in a series along the
columella; outwardly they are terminated by very long free branchlets,
which vary from simple to two or three times forked or branched. Spores
globose, minutely warted, dark brown, 8&ndash;10 mic. in diameter. <a href="#i077">See Plate
XI, Fig. 31.</a></p>

<p>Growing on old wood and bark of Elm, Willow, etc., in Autumn. Sporangium
with the stipe 15&ndash;40 mm. in length, the stipe 3&ndash;8 mm. long, the
sporangium .25-.40 mm. in thickness. This is the most characteristic
species of the genus, being farthest removed from Stemonitis.</p>

<p>8. <span class="smcap">Comatricha flaccida</span>, Lister. Sporangia growing closely crowded
together and more or less confluent, on a purplish-brown hypothallus,
the walls fugacious. Columellas rising simply from the common
hypothallus, or sometimes grown together below and then apparently
branching, running through to the apex, and there often confluent with
each other, or joined together by portions of membrane. Capillitium of
slender brown threads, which branch and anasto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>mose very irregularly,
forming a ragged network with large irregular meshes, and long free
extremities; the capillitium of adjoining columellas being much
entangled, and often confluent or grown together. Spores globose, very
minutely warted, brown, 7&ndash;9 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old wood and bark of Oak, Willow, etc. The component
sporangia 5&ndash;10 mm. in length. The early appearance is much like that of
species of Stemonitis, but the mature stage is a great mass of spores
with scanty capillitium, as in Reticularia; the columellas, however, are
genuine and not adjacent portions of wall grown together. Arthur Lister
calls this <i>Stemonitis splendens</i>, var. <i>flaccida</i>.</p>


<p class="break">IV. STEMONITIS, Gled. Sporangia subcylindric, elongated, stipitate,
standing close together on a well-developed common hypothallus, the wall
very thin and evanescent. Stipe brown or black, smooth and shining,
tapering upward, entering the sporangium and prolonged nearly to the
apex as a slender columella, the stipe shorter than the columella.
Capillitium arising from numerous points of the columella throughout its
entire length; the threads immediately branch and anastomose to form an
interior network of large meshes, they then spread out next the wall of
the sporangium into a superficial network of smaller meshes. Spores
globose, brown or violaceous.</p>

<p>In this genus there are two distinctly differentiated series in the
capillitium, the one an interior supporting network of large meshes, the
other a superficial network of smaller meshes; sometimes the superficial
network disappears or is wanting toward the upper part of the
capillitium, there is then an approach to Comatricha. Very minute
scattered branchlets usually connect the superficial network with the
wall of the sporangium.</p>

<p>§1. <span class="smcap">Dictynna.</span> Threads of the capillitium arising from numerous points of
the columella, immediately branching several times and anastomosing to
form the interior network of large meshes; the superficial network
consisting of small irregular and unequal meshes, varying from smaller
than the spores to two or three times their diameter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Stemonitis fusca</span>, Roth. Sporangia elongated, subcylindric, tapering
and obtuse at the apex, tapering gradually downward, growing closely
crowded together on a strongly-developed brown hypothallus. Stipe and
columella smooth and black, tapering gradually upward and disappearing
near the apex of the sporangium, the stipe shorter than the columella.
Capillitium of slender brown or blackish threads, which immediately
branch and anastomose, forming a dense interior network of large
irregular meshes, the ultimate branchlets of which support a superficial
network of small polygonal meshes. Spores globose, dark violaceous, the
surface minutely warted, the warts with a reticulate arrangement, 7&ndash;9
mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old wood, bark, leaves, etc.; common everywhere. Sporangium
with the stipe 6&ndash;15 mm. in height, the sporangium .3-.4 mm. in
thickness, the stipe variable in length, but always shorter than the
sporangium. The meshes of the superficial net vary in size in the same
sporangium, being usually 5&ndash;25 mic. in width, but sometimes they are
larger, ranging from 10&ndash;40 mic. in extent. The name <i>Stemonitis maxima</i>
was given by Schweinitz to some unusually large specimens which grew on
a Polyporus. <i>Stemonitis dictyospora</i> of Rostafinski's monograph, with
spores 12 mic. in diameter, is said to occur in South Carolina; I have
seen no specimens.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Stemonitis tenerrima</span>, B. &amp; C. Sporangia small, subcylindric, tapering

smooth, tapering gradually upward and vanishing toward the apex of the
sporangium, the stipe shorter than the columella. Capillitium of very
slender pale violet threads, which branch and anastomose to form a dense
interior network of large irregular meshes, and then spread out into a
superficial network of small polygonal meshes. Spores globose, even,
pale brownish-violet, 6&ndash;8 mic. in diameter. <a href="#i077">See Plate XI, Fig. 32.</a></p>

<p>Growing on old wood, mosses, etc. Sporangium with the stipe 5&ndash;9 mm. in

superficial network varying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> usually from 3&ndash;15 mic. in width, but
sometimes larger from 8&ndash;25 mic. The species grows scantily in this

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Stemonitis microspora</span>, Lister. Plasmodium white. Sporangia elongated,
subcylindric, tapering and obtuse at the apex, tapering gradually
downward, growing closely crowded together on a strongly-developed brown
hypothallus. Stipe and columella brown and smooth, tapering gradually
upward and reaching nearly to the apex of the sporangium, the stipe
shorter than the columella. Capillitium of slender tawny-brown threads;
the primary branches simple or only branched above, or with a few
lateral anastomosing branchlets, forming a rather loose network of large
irregular meshes; these support a superficial network of very small
polygonal meshes. Spores globose, even, tawny-brown, 5&ndash;6 mic. in
diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old wood, bark, leaves, etc.; very common in this region.
Sporangium with the stipe 7&ndash;15 mm. in height, the sporangium .3-.4 mm.
in thickness, the stipe shorter than the sporangium. Meshes of the
superficial network 4&ndash;20 mic. in width. I am indebted to Arthur Lister,
Esq., of London, for pointing out to me the difference between this
species and the <i>Stemonitis ferruginea</i> of Fries and Rostafinski.</p>

subcylindric, the apex obtuse, growing closely crowded together on a
thin, brown hypothallus. Stipe and columella brown and smooth, tapering
gradually upward and vanishing beneath the apex of the sporangium, the
stipe much shorter than the columella. Capillitium of slender,
tawny-brown threads, which immediately branch and anastomose, forming a
dense interior network of large irregular meshes, supporting a
superficial network of small polygonal meshes. Spores globose, very
minutely warted, tawny-brown in color, 7&ndash;9 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old wood, leaves, grasses, etc. Sporangium with the stipe

to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> specimen. The species is certainly rare in this country, and my
description is drawn up from British specimens. But I am unable to
distinguish authentic specimens of <i>Stemonitis herbatica</i>, Peck, from
these British specimens.</p>

<p>§2. <span class="smcap">Megalodictys.</span> Threads of the capillitium arising from rather distant
points of the columella, branching and anastomosing but a few times,
thus forming an interior network of very large meshes; the superficial

flexuous brown threads; these immediately branch and anastomose several
times, forming an interior network of very large meshes; the superficial
network consisting of large irregular meshes, sometimes much elongated.
Spores globose, very minutely warted, brown, 7&ndash;9 mic. in diameter. <a href="#i077">See

thickness; meshes of the superficial net of the capillitium 40&ndash;100&ndash;150
mic. in extent. This is a much smaller species than <i>Stemonitis
splendens</i>, and the structure of the interior network of the capillitium
is entirely different.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">Stemonitis splendens</span>, Rost. Sporangia linear-cylindric, obtuse at the
apex, growing close together on a conspicuous hypothallus. Stipe and
columella black and shining, the stipe very short, the columella

Peck.</p>


<p class="break">V. ENERTHENEMA, Bowm. Sporangium regular, globose, stipitate; the wall
thin and fragile, fugacious. Stipe stout, thick, tapering upward,
entering the sporangium and prolonged to its apex, there expanding into
a discoid membrane. Capillitium originating from the lower surface of
the apical disk of the columella; the threads branched a few times and
hanging downward, their extremities free. Spores globose, violaceous.</p>

<p>A well-marked genus, by reason of the peculiar origin of the
capillitium.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Enerthenema papillatum</span>, Pers. Sporangium globose, stipitate; the wall
brown or blackish, soon disappearing. Stipe black, rugulose, thick
below, tapering above into the slender columella, which, at its apex,
expands into a thin membranaceous disk. Capillitium of long brown
threads suspended from the apical disk, the threads branched a few
times, occasionally anastomosing by a short, transverse branchlet, the
free ends often forked. Spores globose, very minutely warted,

myself, and have received only a few specimens from elsewhere.</p>


<p class="break">VI. DIACHÆA, Fr. Sporangia globose to oblong, stipitate, arising from a
common hypothallus; the wall thin, rugulose, iridescent with metallic
tints, breaking up irregularly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> gradually falling away. Stipe and
columella thick, erect, rigid, tapering upward, filled with minute,
roundish granules of lime, white or yellowish in color. Capillitium
arising from numerous points of the columella, the threads repeatedly
branching and anastomosing to form an intricate network, attaining the
wall by numerous short free extremities. Spores globose, violaceous.</p>

<p>This genus is scarcely to be distinguished from Lamproderma, except by
the white mass of lime which fills the tube of the stipe and columella.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Diachæa leucopoda</span>, Bull. Sporangia ovoid-oblong to short cylindric,
the base obtuse or slightly umbilicate, the apex more rounded; the wall
with bronze, blue, purple, and violet tints, gradually falling away.
Stipe short, thick, white, arising from a white, venulose, hypothallus,

depressed, with the base umbilicate; the wall steel-blue with tints of
purple and violet, quite persistent, rupturing irregularly. Stipe short,
thick, white, arising from a white, reticulate hypothallus, tapering
upward; the columella oblong or short cylindric, extending beyond the
center of the sporangium. Capillitium of slender, brown threads, which
branch several times and form a loose network of rather large meshes.
Spores subglobose, with very large warts, dark violet, 8&ndash;10 mic. in
diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old leaves and twigs. Sporangium .4-.6 mm. in diameter, the
stipe about the same length. This is a beautiful species.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Diachæa Thomasii</span>, Rex. Sporangia globose, or sometimes a little
depressed; the wall gold-bronze, with tints of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> purple and blue,
subpersistent, rupturing irregularly. Stipe thick, dull ochre-yellow in
color, variable in length, usually very short and sometimes quite
obsolete, arising from an ochre-yellow hypothallus; the columella
varying from bluntly-conical to cylindric-clavate, attaining the center
of the sporangium. Capillitium of slender, brown threads, radiating from
all points of the columella, branching several times and forming a loose
network of elongated meshes. Spores globose, minutely warted,

<p>Growing on sticks, leaves, etc. Sporangium .5-.7 mm. in diameter, the
stipe usually shorter or sometimes wanting. This species has been found
only in the mountains of North Carolina. I am indebted to Dr. George A.
Rex for my example. In its structure the species is essentially a
Lamproderma, but the stipe and columella are stuffed with granules of
lime.</p>

<p>Sporangia simple and subglobose, or plasmodiocarp, rarely combined into
an æthalium. Wall of the sporangium a thin membrane with an outer layer
composed of minute stellate crystals, or of minute roundish granules of
lime; these either lie singly upon the surface, or are compacted into a
crustaceous coat. Stipe present or often wanting; the columella usually
conspicuous and well-developed. Capillitium consisting of very slender,
often sinuous threads, which extend from the base of the sporangium or
from the columella to the walls, either simple or outwardly branching a
few times at a sharp angle, combined into a loose irregular net by a few
transverse branchlets, which are situated chiefly at the extremities.
Spores globose, violaceous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>This order is readily distinguished from the Physaraceæ by the absence
of lime from the threads of the capillitium.</p>

diameter, the stipe about as long as the diameter of the sporangium or
sometimes much longer, usually, however, much shorter than the diameter

numerous roundish vesicles, composed of a brownish membrane, inclosing a
yellow coloring matter, the vesicles 30&ndash;50 mic. in diameter. Spores
globose, very minutely warted, violaceous, 7&ndash;8 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old leaves, bark, etc. The plasmodiocarp .6-.8 mm. in

irregularly-branched sporangia, more or less closely compacted together
and confluent, seated upon a well-developed common hypothallus; the
walls of the sporangia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> a thin membrane with an outer layer of minute,
stellate crystals of lime. Each sporangium traversed by a central
subcylindric hollow columella, which extends also to the branches, but
does not reach to their apices. Capillitium of slender threads, more or
less branched, and combined into a network. Spores globose, violaceous.</p>

<p>Spumaria is essentially related to Didymium by the crystals of lime upon
the walls of the sporangia. Rostafinski's figure 158 can only be
regarded as ideal or diagrammatic. I am disposed to question the
existence of the central columella altogether; if it does exist, it must
be extremely defective.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Spumaria alba</span>, Bull. Plasmodium white, amplectant. Æthalium variable
in form and size, resting upon a white, membranaceous hypothallus, and
usually covered by a white, friable, common cortex composed of minute
crystals of lime. The component sporangia elongated, irregular, more or
less branched, the branches rude, deformed, compressed, laterally
confluent, obtuse or pointed at the apex; the walls of the sporangia
thin and delicate, rugulose, pellucid, with a tinge of violet,
iridescent when divested of the crystals of lime. Capillitium of slender
threads, more or less branched and combined into a net; the threads dark
colored, with pellucid extremities, and furnished with occasional rings
or roundish swellings throughout their length. Spores globose, densely
spinulose, dark violaceous, 10&ndash;14 mic. in diameter. <a href="#i079">Plate XII, Fig. 43.</a></p>

<p>Climbing up and surrounding the stems of small shrubs, herbaceous
plants, culms of grasses, etc., especially those of living plants,
rarely effused upon old wood, bark, leaves, etc. The æthalium from two
or three to several centimeters in length, and with a radial thickness
of two or three to several millimeters. The following forms or varieties
have been distinguished as species at different times:</p>

<p>Var. 1. <span class="smcap lowercase">DIDYMIUM</span>. Sporangia irregular, simple or lobed and branched,
lifted up on narrow, flat extensions of the hypothallus, as if furnished
with short white stipes; the common cortex wanting. This is <i>Didymium
spumarioides</i>, Fr.; it is probably a dwarf form of the next variety.
<a href="#i079">Plate XII, Fig. 42.</a></p>

<p>Var. 2. <span class="smcap lowercase">CORNUTA</span>. Æthalium large and rugged in outline, cinerous from the
scanty cortex; the sporangia loosely com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>pacted, the branches running
out into numerous free-pointed extremities. Capillitium of rather thick
threads, forming a dense net, with broad expansions at the angles.
Spores 11&ndash;14 mic. in diameter. This is <i>Spumaria cornuta</i>, Schum. It is
evidently the form so elaborately figured by Rostafinski, and which
Fries says abounds in Northern Europe.</p>

<p>Var. 3. <span class="smcap lowercase">MUCILAGO</span>. Æthalium large, even and uniform in outline, covered
by a thick, white, common cortex; the sporangia laterally confluent and
densely compacted together throughout. Capillitium of rather slender
threads, forming a loose net, scarcely expanded at the angles. Spores
10&ndash;13 mic. in diameter. This is <i>Spumaria mucilago</i>, Nees, as figured by
Greville in the Scottish Cryptogamic Flora. The capillitium is figured
by McBride in The Myxomycetes of Iowa. This is the only form I have met
with in this country.</p>


<p class="break">III. DIDERMA, Pers. Sporangia subglobose and stipitate or more often
sessile, sometimes plasmodiocarp; the wall a thin membrane, with an
outer layer composed of minute roundish granules of lime, which are
usually compacted into a smooth continuous crust. Stipe present or
mostly absent; the columella usually well developed. Capillitium of very
slender threads, stretching from the columella to the wall of the
sporangium, more or less branched, and combined into a loose net by
short lateral branchlets. Spores globose, violaceous.</p>

<p>This genus is easily recognized by the smooth crustaceous layer of lime
on the outer surface of the sporangium; in many cases this easily shells
off or breaks away. Such a coating occurs in a few species of Physarum,
but here the vesicles of lime attached to the threads distinguish them.
This is Chondrioderma of Rostafinski's monograph; the reason for coining
a new name and entirely discarding the old one is not apparent.</p>

<p>§1. <span class="smcap">Leangium</span>. Sporangium usually stipitate; the wall at maturity
separating from the inner mass of spores and capillitium and splitting
in a stellate manner, the segments becoming reflexed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Diderma radiatum</span>, Linn. Sporangium depressed-globose, the base
flattened or umbilicate, stipitate or nearly sessile; the wall smooth,
whitish or pale brown, splitting from the apex downward into a few
reflexed irregular segments. Stipe short, thick, erect, tapering
downward, standing on a thin membranaceous hypothallus; the columella
large, convex, globose or obovoid, roughened. Capillitium of slender
dark-colored threads, radiating from the columella, simple or branching
outwardly. Spores globose, minutely warted, dark violaceous, 8&ndash;10 mic.
in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old bark and wood. Sporangium .8&ndash;1.2 mm. in diameter, the
stipe shorter than the diameter, sometimes nearly obsolete. Apparently
rare in this country.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Diderma floriforme</span>, Bull. Sporangium globose or obovoid, stipitate,
growing closely crowded together on a thin brown membranaceous
hypothallus; the wall smooth, varying in color from whitish or yellowish
to bright brown, splitting into irregular segments, which become
reflexed and revolute. Stipe long, erect, white or yellowish to brown;
the columella elongated, obovoid to clavate, roughened, colored as the
stipe. Capillitium of dark-colored threads, radiating from the columella
and sparingly branched. Spores globose, with minute scattered warts,
dark violaceous, 9&ndash;11 mic. in diameter. <a href="#i079">Plate XII, Fig. 44.</a></p>

<p>Growing on old wood of oak, hickory, etc., late in Autumn. Sporangium
.7&ndash;1.0 mm. in diameter before dehiscence, the stipe usually longer than
the sporangium. The color of stipe, columella and sporangium varies from
white through yellowish to brown; the spores are quite peculiar by
reason of their prominent scattered warts. I do not think <i>Chondrioderma
Lyallii</i>, Massee, can be maintained as a separate species.</p>

<p>§2. <span class="smcap">Stromnidium</span>. Sporangia growing closely crowded together upon a thick
highly-developed calcareous common hypothallus, either seated upon it or
partially imbedded in its substance; the wall rupturing irregularly.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Diderma spumarioides</span>, Fr. Sporangia rather small, irregularly
subglobose, sessile, seated close together on a strongly-developed
whitish or yellowish common hypothallus; the wall white, rugulose,
covered by a dense farinaceous layer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> of lime. Columella convex,
roughened, white or yellowish, sometimes scarcely developed. Capillitium
rather scanty, of slender colorless threads, sparingly branched,
ascending from the columella. Spores globose, minutely warted,
violaceous, 8&ndash;10 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old leaves, bark, moss, etc. Sporangia .4-.6 mm. in diameter,
irregular and rugulose. On account of the pulverulent coat of lime on
the sporangium, Massee refers the species back to Didymium, where it was
placed by Fries.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Diderma stromateum</span>, Link. Sporangia large, subglobose, depressed,
irregular and angular from mutual pressure, closely crowded together on
a thick yellowish or pinkish common hypothallus; the wall smooth and
even, grayish-white or cinereous, with a thin closely connate outer
layer of minute granules of lime. Columella considerably elevated or
much depressed, convex, subglobose or quite irregular, white or colored,
as the hypothallus, especially at the base. Capillitium of abundant
colored threads, more or less branched and combined into a loose net.
Spores globose, minutely warted, violaceous, 8&ndash;10 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on Hickory bark. The sporangia .5-.8 mm. in diameter, the
surface smooth. Rostafinski, in his Monograph, places this species as a
variety of <i>D. spumarioides</i>, but in the Appendix it is separated as a
species. The sporangia are quite different from those of <i>D.
spumarioides</i>, but I can see no difference in the spores.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Diderma globosum</span>, Pers. Sporangia subglobose, more or less irregular
from mutual pressure, closely crowded together on a thick, white
hypothallus, seated upon it or usually sunk into its substance at the
base; the wall with a white, smooth, and polished crustaceous outer
layer of lime, distinct and separable from the inner membrane, easily
breaking into fragments, and falling away: the inner membrane very thin,
rugulose, cinereous with granules of lime or free from them and
iridescent. Columella white, small, irregular, subglobose or
ellipsoidal, rarely wanting. Capillitium of slender, dark colored
threads, more or less branched and combined into a loose net. Spores
globose, very minutely warted, violaceous, 8&ndash;10 mic. in diameter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>Growing on old leaves. Sporangia .5-.8 mm. in diameter, the surface
smooth and polished.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">Diderma crustaceum</span>, Peck. Sporangia subglobose, irregular from mutual
pressure, closely crowded together on a thick, yellowish-white common
hypothallus, and at the base confluent with its substance; the wall with
a creamy white, smooth, crustaceous outer layer of lime, distinct and
separable from the inner membrane, and easily breaking up and falling
away; the inner membrane very thin, rugulose, cinereous and iridescent.
Columella whitish or cream colored, small, irregular, subglobose or
ellipsoidal, often wanting. Capillitium of slender, uneven, dark colored
threads, branched and combined into a loose net. Spores globose,
minutely warted, violet-black, opaque, 12&ndash;15 mic. in diameter. <a href="#i079">Plate
XII, Fig. 45.</a></p>

<p>Growing on old leaves, sticks, etc. A common species in this country.
Sporangia .7&ndash;1.0 mm. in diameter, the surface even but finely
pulverulent rather than polished. <i>Chondrioderma affine</i>, Rost., is said
to be the same species. It is readily distinguished from <i>D. globosum</i>,
by the much larger spores.</p>

<p>§3. <span class="smcap">Astrotium</span>. Sporangia gregarious, scattered, or sometimes crowded and
confluent, often much depressed, sessile, rarely stipitate; the
hypothallus none or very scanty.</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap">Diderma Michelii</span>, Lib. Sporangia orbicular, very much depressed,
often umbilicate above and concave underneath, stipitate or sessile,
gregarious, with the margins of the sporangia sometimes confluent. The
wall with a white crustaceous layer of lime, which soon ruptures around
the edges, allowing the upper part to break in pieces and fall away; the
inner membrane cinereous, rupturing irregularly. Stipe short, stout,
erect, arising from a small, circular hypothallus, whitish or
alutaceous, longitudinally rugulose, expanding at the apex, the wrinkles
running out as veins on the under side of the sporangium; the columella
much flattened, lenticular or discoid, alutaceous or pinkish.
Capillitium of very slender, colorless threads, simple or forking a time
or two, and connected by short branchlets at the extremities. Spores
globose, even, violaceous, 7&ndash;9 mic. in diameter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>Growing on sticks, leaves, herbaceous stems, etc. Sporangium .8&ndash;1.2 mm.
in diameter, the stipe shorter than the diameter, sometimes very short
or quite obsolete.</p>

<p>8. <span class="smcap">Diderma testaceum</span>, Schr. Sporangia circular or oval, much depressed,
sessile, without any hypothallus, gregarious, irregularly scattered,
sometimes close and even confluent. The outer calcareous layer of the
wall thick, smooth, crustaceous, separate and distinct from the inner
membrane, white or pinkish-white to rose-red in color, gradually
breaking up in pieces and falling away; the inner membrane thin,
pellucid, cinereous from the adherent granules of lime, irregularly
dehiscent from the apex downward. Columella hemispheric or depressed,
granulose-roughened, white, pinkish, or fleshy-red. Capillitium of very
slender, nearly colorless threads, more or less branched. Spores
globose, very minutely warted, 8&ndash;10 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old leaves, wood, mosses, etc. Very common in this country.
Sporangium .6&ndash;1.0 mm. in diameter, sometimes a little irregular,
especially the form growing on mosses, and occasionally confluent.</p>

<p>9. <span class="smcap">Diderma cinereum</span>, Morgan, n. sp. Sporangia subglobose, more or less
irregular, somewhat depressed, sessile, usually close or crowded,
sometimes confluent; the hypothallus a thin membrane, pellucid or with
occasional patches of lime granules, sometimes not apparent. The wall
very thin, even or rugulose, cinereous, the thin membrane covered by a
single layer of closely-adherent granules of lime, rupturing
irregularly. Columella white, hemispheric or depressed and irregular,
the surface granulose. Capillitium of very slender, colored threads, the
extremities pellucid, more or less branched. Spores globose, minutely
warted, violaceous, 9&ndash;11 mic. in diameter. <a href="#i079">Plate XII, Fig. 46.</a></p>

<p>Growing on old wood, leaves, etc. The sporangium .3-.5 mm. in diameter,
thin and smooth or rugulose. The species superficially greatly resembles
<i>Physarum cinereum</i>.</p>

<p>10. <span class="smcap">Diderma difforme</span>, Pers. Plasmodiocarp roundish, oblong, or more or
less elongated and flexuous, scattered or seriately disposed; the
hypothallus a thin brownish membrane, or commonly not apparent. The

from the inner membrane, breaking into pieces and falling away; the
inner membrane thin, opaque and bluish or pellucid and iridescent.
Columella reduced to a thin layer of scales and granules upon the
brownish basal membrane. Capillitium scanty, consisting of short nearly
colorless threads, which are simple, or fork a time or two. Spores
globose, even, dark violaceous, 10&ndash;13 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on bark, leaves, twigs, herbaceous stems, etc. Plasmodiocarp
.3-.5 mm. in thickness and variable in length, sometimes elongated
several millimeters.</p>

<p>11. <span class="smcap">Diderma reticulatum</span>, Rost. Plasmodiocarp very much depressed,
roundish, oblong, much elongated and flexuous, closely crowded together
and confluent; the hypothallus a thin white granulose layer of lime,
scarcely broader than the plasmodiocarp. The outer calcareous layer of
the wall white, distinct, very fragile and easily shelling off; the
inner membrane much shrunken and withdrawn from the outer coat,
rugulose, cinereous, with a dense closely-adherent layer of granules of

<p>Growing on old wood, leaves, twigs, etc. Plasmodiocarp .5-.8 mm. in
width, much flattened and usually closely crowded. The rough calcareous
base of the plasmodiocarp might be considered as either all columella or
all hypothallus, with the upper surface leather-colored. I am indebted
to Arthur Lister, of London, for the determination of my specimens.</p>

<p>12. <span class="smcap">Diderma effusum</span>, Schw. Plasmodiocarp very much flattened,
longitudinally creeping and reticulate or altogether widely effused;

I am indebted to Dr. Geo. A. Rex, of Philadelphia, for the
identification of my specimens, with those in the herbarium of
Schweinitz, under the name of <i>Physarum effusum</i>.</p>


<p class="break">IV. LEPIDODERMA, DeB. Sporangium stipitate or sessile, sometimes
plasmodiocarp; the wall a thin, firm, colorless membrane, with an outer
layer of large scales consisting of bicarbonate of lime, the scales
either lying upon the wall or inclosed in lenticular cavities of the

<p>Sporangia simple and stipitate or sessile, sometimes plasmodiocarp,
rarely combined into an aethalium; the wall a thin membrane, usually
with an outer layer of minute roundish granules of lime. Stipe present
or often wanting, seldom prolonged within the sporangium as a columella.
Capillitium consisting of slender tubules, which branch repeatedly in
every direction and anastomose to form an intricate network, the
extremities attached on all sides to the wall of the sporangium; the
tubules more or less expanded at the angles of the network and inclosing
minute roundish granules of lime, these granules either aggregated into
nodules with intervening empty spaces or more rarely distributed
throughout their entire length. Spores globose, very rarely ellipsoidal,
violaceous.</p>

<p>This order is at once distinguished from the Didymiaceæ by the presence
of the granules of lime in the capillitium.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>Growing on old leaves, sticks, mosses, etc. Plasmodiocarp commonly about
1 mm. in height and 1&ndash;5 mm. in length, but the size is variable. The
color appears to depend upon the thickening of the membrane; when it is
thin and pellucid, the color is white or cinereous from the inner layer
of lime and the contained spores; with a more thickened membrane, the
color becomes ochraceous or brownish. <i>Physarum bivalve</i> Pers. <i>Physarum
sinuosum</i> of Rostafinski's monograph. <a href="#i119">See Plate XIII. Fig. 49.</a></p>

areas and with thicker yellow-brown or red-brown spots; the outer
surface without any lime, smooth, and shining; the inner surface with a
dense layer of yellow granules raised at intervals into transverse
ridges, these are connected with broad thin flat plates of lime which
traverse the capillitium, forming imperfect septa to the sporangium.
Capillitium consisting of slender yellow tubules, forming a network of
irregular meshes, with slight expansions at the angles and bearing along
the sides short pointed or uncinate free branchlets; the tubules

<p class="break">IV. PHYSARELLA Peck. Sporangium oblong, stipitate; the apex re-entrant
and confluent with the hollow columella; the wall a thin membrane
covered with small scales and minute granules of lime, at maturity torn
away at the apex and stellately splitting into a few segments. Stipe
elongated, tapering upward, entering the sporangium and prolonged to the
apex as a tubaeform columella. Capillitium distinguished by two distinct
sets of tubules; the first consisting of long, thick tubules filled with
lime, rising at regular intervals from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> the wall of the sporangium and
extending to the columella; the second, of very slender threads,
scarcely branched, and nearly destitute of lime, stretching between the
wall and the columella. Spores globose, violaceous.</p>

<p>A genus founded upon the one remarkable species, and more distinct than
any other from the typical genus of the Physaraceae. In fact, the
structure of the sporangium is unique among the Myxomycetes.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Physarella oblonga</span> B. &amp; C. Sporangium oblong, the apex re-entrant and
confluent with the summit of the columella, the base obtuse or slightly
umbilicate, stipitate, cernuous. The wall of the sporangium a firm,
yellowish membrane, covered with minute granules and with scattered,
small, yellow scales of lime; after maturity the apex is torn away more
or less irregularly from the summit of the columella and the wall splits
into a few segments, which become reflexed and are subpersistent about
the base of the sporangium. Stipe long, erect or flexuous, the apex bent
or curved, red-brown, rising from a small hypothallus, entering the
sporangium and prolonged to the apex as a hollow tubaeform columella.
Capillitium of thick, spiniform tubules filled with lime and slender,
violet threads, extending between the wall and the columella. The
tubules elongated, terete, tapering gradually from wall to columella,
containing yellow granules of lime; the threads very slender, outwardly
branched a time or two, the further extremities connected by short,
lateral branches, often furnished with minute, free branchlets, and
containing a few small, fusiform nodules of lime. Spores globose, nearly
smooth, violaceous, 7&ndash;9 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old wood, bark, leaves, etc. Sporangium commonly .8&ndash;1.0 mm.
in length by .5-.6 mm. in diameter, the stipe 1&ndash;2 mm. long; the
spiniform tubules measure 150&ndash;200 × 15&ndash;20 mic. <a href="#i119">See Plate XIII. Fig. 53.</a></p>

<p>The abnormal forms of this species which sometimes manifest themselves
are very singular; the sporangium has a tendency to dilate, becoming
funnel-form or even salver-shaped, the stipe shortening and even
disappearing. I have a large specimen which superficially resembles some
lichen, a <i>Physcia</i>, for example; the sporangia are pressed down,
flattened out, extremely irregular, and in many places confluent;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> the
rudimentary stipes are hidden beneath the leafy expansions. In all the
forms, however, may be uncovered the spiniform tubules mingled with the
slender threads. This is <i>Trichamphora oblonga</i> B. &amp; C. <i>Tilmadoche

nodules of lime. Spores globose, violaceous.</p>

<p>This genus is readily distinguished from <i>Physarum</i> by the columella,

defined, the species includes <i>Physarum aurantium</i> var. <i>rufipes</i> A. &amp;

yellow-brown membrane, the outer surface of the cup entirely naked,
smooth and shining, varying greatly in color from alutaceous or
ochraceous to various shades of brown; the lid usually whitened by a
thin layer of granules of lime. Stipe short, erect or bent, and slightly
curved at the apex, varying in color from rusty yellow to reddish brown,

in the color of the granules of lime; the form of the sporangium and the

Mont., the yellow-green form <i>D. gyrocephalum</i> Mont. Sprengel considered
this species the same as <i>Physarum compactum</i> Ehr., and it appears under

sometimes entirely filled with lime, so that the species approaches
Badhamia in the structure of its capillitium.</p>

<p>18. <span class="smcap">Physarum leucopus</span> Link. Sporangium globose, the base slightly
flattened, stipitate; the wall a thin, violaceous membrane, with a
white, pulverulent outer coat of minute granules of lime. Stipe short,
thick, erect, snow-white, longitudinally rugulose, tapering upward,
expanding at the base into small, white hypothallus. Capillitium a loose
net-work of tubules, with wide expansions at the angles; the nodules of
lime large, white, numerous, irregularly lobed and branched. Spores
globose, very minutely warted, violaceous, 8&ndash;10 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old wood, leaves, etc. Sporangium .3-.4 mm. in diameter, the
stipe about the same length as the diameter. Our specimens are a smaller
form than the European, with smaller and smoother spores. Superficially
the species resembles <i>Didymium squamulosum</i>, and it is <i>Didymium
leucopus</i> of Fries, S. M.</p>

<p>19. <span class="smcap">Physarum glaucum</span> Phillips. Sporangium globose, or the base slightly
depressed, stipitate; the wall a thin, violaceous membrane, covered with
minute, white granules and small roundish or irregular scales of lime.
Stipe short, stout, erect, black, longitudinally wrinkled, expanding at
the base into a small hypothallus. Capillitium of much-flattened
tubules, forming a loose net-work, widely expanded at the angles; the
nodules of lime numerous, large, white, irregular, with pointed angles
and lobes. Spores globose, very minutely warted, dark violaceous, 12&ndash;14
mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old leaves: California. Sporangium .5-.7 mm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> in diameter,
the stipe not longer than the diameter. This is quite a robust species,
both externally and in the broad, flat tubules of the capillitium. <a href="#i123">See Plate XV. Fig. 64.</a></p>

<p>20. <span class="smcap">Physarum relatum</span> Morgan, n. sp. Sporangium globose, the base
umbilicate, stipitate, often cernuous; the wall a thin, violaceous
membrane, rugulose and iridescent, covered with small, roundish or
irregular white scales of lime. Stipe long, erect or inclined, rising
from a thin hypothallus, tapering upward, white or cream color to
ochraceous. Capillitium a dense net-work of tubules, more or less
expanded at the angles, and almost entirely filled with white granules
of lime, leaving only here and there short, slender empty spaces. Spores
globose, nearly smooth, violaceous, 8&ndash;9 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old wood. Sporangium .5-.6 mm. in diameter, the stipe about
twice this length. The capillitium is rigid, with the abundance of lime
almost as in the genus <i>Badhamia</i>. Superficially the species much
resembles <i>Cytidium globuliferum</i> or <i>Physarum compactum</i>, but the
disposition of the lime on the wall and in the capillitium is altogether
different. <a href="#i121">See Plate XIV. Fig. 63.</a></p>

<p>21. <span class="smcap">Physarum auriscalpium</span> Cke. Sporangia subglobose, depressed,
substipitate; the wall a hyaline membrane with a thin, closely adherent
layer of minute granules of lime, over which are scattered large,
irregular, orange-red scales of lime. Stipe very short, sometimes almost
obsolete. Capillitium of tubules forming a loose net-work, with widely
expanded angles, and mostly filled with orange granules of lime, only
here and there short, slender, empty spaces. Spores globose, minutely
warted, dark violaceous, 11&ndash;13 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on rotten wood; South Carolina, Ravenel. Sporangia .6-.8 mm. in
diameter, the stipe very short. Described in <i>Annals of the Lyceum of
Natural History of New York</i>, June, 1877. So fine a species ought to be
found again. Cooke's specimen was examined by Lister, <i>Mycetozoa</i>, p.
61.</p>

<p class="center"><i>B. Sporangia sessile.</i></p>

<p>22. <span class="smcap">Physarum plumbeum</span> Fr. Sporangia small, globose or obovoid, sessile,
on a narrow base, gregarious, sometimes close but seldom confluent; the
wall a thin violaceous mem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>brane, with a very thin layer of small white
scales and minute granules of lime, sometimes naked. Capillitium a loose
net-work of slender tubules, with slight expansions at the angles; the
nodules of lime white, numerous, more or less elongated, irregularly
lobed and branched. Spores globose, even, violaceous, 7&ndash;9 mic. in
diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old leaves, sticks, etc. Sporangia .3-.4 mm. in diameter,
quite regular in shape, attached by a narrow base, sometimes by a mere
point, rarely confluent. The lime on the wall of the sporangium is
rather scanty, sometimes altogether absent, and the nodules of lime in
the capillitium are rather small. The species is figured by Micheli N.
P. G. Tab. 96, Fig. 9. It is named by Fries S. M., III, p. 142. It is
figured again by De Bary, <i>Die Mycetozoen</i>, Tafel I.</p>

<p>23. <span class="smcap">Physarum atrum</span> Schw. Sporangia sessile, subglobose or oblong, by
confluence, more or less elongated, bent or flexuous and branched; the
wall a thin violaceous membrane, rugulose, covered by a wrinkled and
reticulate layer of white granules of lime, which sometimes become thin
or disappear. Capillitium a loose net-work of tubules, more or less
expanded at the angles; the nodules of lime white, numerous, large,
irregularly lobed and branched. Spores globose, very minutely warted,
violaceous, 8&ndash;10 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old leaves, bark, grasses, etc.; apparently the most common
of these three cinereous species. Sporangia .3-.5 mm. in thickness, some
of them roundish or oblong, others elongated to several millimeters. The
sporangium is often elegantly reticulate as observed by Schweinitz even
when the lime is quite scanty. In Saccardo's <i>Sylloge</i> Berlese changed
the name to <i>Physarum reticulatum</i>, but this is unnecessary, as the
<i>Physarum atrum</i> of Fries is not a Myxomyces.</p>

<p>24. <span class="smcap">Physarum cinereum</span> Batsch. Sporangia large, subglobose, sessile,
gregarious, sometimes close and confluent; the wall a thin violaceous
membrane, with a closely adherent layer of minute granules, over which
are scattered irregular white scales of lime. Capillitium of tubules
forming a loose net-work, with wide expansions at the angles; the
nodules of lime numerous, white, very large, with pointed angles and
lobes, by confluence often branched and reticulate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> and occasionally
forming a pseudo-columella in the center of the sporangium. Spores
globose, minutely warted, dark violaceous, 10&ndash;13 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old wood, leaves, etc. The sporangia .4-.6 mm. in diameter,
more or less irregular. The great abundance of lime in the capillitium
and the large distinctly warted spores distinguish this species.
<i>Physarum cinereum</i> of Persoon's Synopsis, <i>Didymium cinereum</i> of Fries'
<i>Systema.</i> The only American specimens I have of this species are from
Iowa (<i>McBride</i>) and from Nebraska (<i>Webber</i>).</p>

<p>25. <span class="smcap">Physarum virescens</span> Ditm. Sporangia large, subglobose, irregular and
unequal, sessile, gregarious, sometimes crowded, but not often
confluent; the wall a thin membrane, violaceous, or in places yellowish,
with a dense layer of yellow or greenish-yellow scales and granules of
lime. Capillitium a loose net-work of tubules, with wide expansions at
the angles; the nodules of lime large, numerous, yellow or
greenish-yellow, more or less elongated, lobed, and branched. Spores
globose or somewhat irregular, very minutely warted, violaceous, 9&ndash;11
mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old leaves, mosses, etc. Sporangia .5-.8 mm. in diameter,
occasionally by confluence more elongated. Though found in all parts of
the country, the species seems rare. This is not the <i>Physarum
virescens</i> described by Rostafinski.</p>

<p>26. <span class="smcap">Physarum rubiginosum</span> Fr. Sporangia subglobose, sessile, gregarious;
the wall a thin hyaline membrane, thickly covered with large irregular
scales of lime, orange to red or dark red in color, breaking up
irregularly. Capillitium of hyaline tubules, forming a loose irregular
net-work, more or less expanded at the angles; the nodules of lime
large, angular, and irregular, sometimes confluent, orange to dark red
in color. Spores globose, very minutely warted, dark violaceous, 9&ndash;11
mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old wood, leaves, mosses, etc. Sporangia .6-.8 mm. in
diameter. <i>Physarum fulvum</i> Fries S. M., III, p. 143. A rare species. It
should not be confounded with <i>Physarum lateritium</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>27. <span class="smcap">Physarum serpula</span> Morgan, <i>n. nom.</i> Plasmodiocarp roundish or oblong
to much elongated, bent, annular and flexuous, sometimes by confluence
branched and reticulate; the wall a firm yellowish membrane, with a
thin, rough, closely adherent coat of granules of lime, dull ochre to
lemon-yellow and orange in color. Capillitium a dense net-work of
tubules, for the most part filled with lime, only here and there short,
slender, empty spaces; the nodules large, numerous, white or yellow,
angular and with pointed lobes and branchlets. Spores globose, minutely
warted, dark violaceous, 9&ndash;11 mic. in diameter. <a href="#i123">See Plate XV. Fig. 65.</a></p>

<p>Growing on leaves, bark, lichens, etc. Plasmodiocarp .3-.4 mm. in
thickness and of varying length. This species is in the herbarium of
Schweinitz, at Philadelphia, with the name <i>Physarum reticulatum</i>; it is
described by George Massee as <i>Physarum gyrosum</i>; by Lister it is
incorporated with several other species under <i>Badhamia decipiens</i>.</p>

<p>28. <span class="smcap">Physarum contextum</span> Pers. Sporangia sessile and closely crowded
together, roundish or more or less elongated, flexuous and complicate,
the apex plane or impressed; the wall a firm yellowish membrane, covered
by a thick pulveraceous layer of lime, white, ochraceous or yellow,
easily crumbling and breaking up. Capillitium a loose net-work of
tubules, much expanded at the angles; the nodules of lime very large,
white or yellow, numerous, angular, and irregular, by confluence lobed
and branched, sometimes massed together in the center of the sporangium.
Spores globose, minutely warted, dark violaceous, 10&ndash;13 mic. in
diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on bark, leaves, mosses, etc. Sporangia with a width of .3-.5
mm. and varying in length from .5 mm. to 1 or 2 mm. The sporangia are
often so much crowded as to appear to be grown together. <i>Diderma
ochroleucum</i> B. &amp; C. belongs to this species. <i>Physarum conglomeratum</i>
Fr. is a closely related species, with smaller and smoother spores. I
have not met with this.</p>

<p>29. <span class="smcap">Physarum diderma</span> Rost. Sporangia large, irregularly globose or
oblong, sessile, but without a hypothallus, closely crowded together and
sometimes confluent. The wall composed of two distinct and separate
layers; the outer a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> thick, uneven, crustaceous, snow-white layer of
lime; the inner a thin, violaceous membrane, cinereous from the adherent
granules of lime, or free from them, and iridescent. Capillitium of
tubules forming a loose net-work, with wide expansions at the angles;
the nodules of lime numerous, snow-white, large, irregular, with pointed
angles and lobes, sometimes confluent in the center of the sporangium.
Spores globose, minutely warted, dark violaceous, 9&ndash;10 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on wood, bark, and mosses. Sporangia .8&ndash;1.0 mm. in diameter,
more or less irregular. The wall of the sporangium is exactly like that
of certain species of <i>Diderma</i>. This species must be rare, as I have
met with it but twice in ten years, and I am not aware that it has ever
been found by any one else.</p>


<p class="break">VIII. FULIGO Haller. Aethalium a compound plasmodiocarp; the component
sporangia branching and anastomosing in every direction, complicate and
grown together; the walls of the sporangia a thin membrane, coated with
minute, roundish granules of lime. Capillitium of tubules forming a
net-work of irregular meshes, more or less expanded at the angles, the
tubules containing in greater or less abundance irregular nodules of
lime. Spores globose or sometimes ellipsoidal, violaceous.</p>

<p>The genus is readily distinguished from <i>Spumaria</i> by the round granules
of lime upon the walls of the sporangia.</p>

<p>§1. <span class="smcap">Aethalium</span> Link. Aethalia large; the lime in the capillitium scanty,
the nodules small, ellipsoidal, or fusiform.</p>

<p class="center"><i>a. Aethalium with a thick fragile common cortex.</i></p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Fuligo rufa</span> Pers. Plasmodium a large soft mass with a peculiar odor

sporangia closely compacted, entirely grown together and inseparable,
covered by a thick common cortex, and seated on a much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> thickened
hypothallus; walls of the sporangia a thin pellucid membrane, coated by
a thin layer of white granules of lime. Capillitium of very slender
tubules, extending across from wall to wall, sparingly branched and
scarcely forming a network, not at all or only slightly expanded at the
angles; the tubules for the most part empty, here and there with slight
fusiform or elongated swellings containing granules of lime,
occasionally bearing roundish or ellipsoidal nodules of larger size.
Spores globose, nearly smooth, violaceous, 6&ndash;9 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old trunks in woods in great abundance from early Spring to
Winter. Aethalium 3&ndash;6 or sometimes many centimeters in extent and 1&ndash;2
cm. in thickness. The common cortex and the hypothallus are a millimeter
or more in thickness; they are composed of successive layers of thin
plates of membrane coated with granules of lime.</p>

<p class="center"><i>b. Aethalium naked, i. e., without a common cortex.</i></p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Fuligo violacea</span> Pers. Plasmodium a soft effused mass, dark red or
wine-colored. Aethalium large, pulvinate or effused, orbicular or more
or less elongated and irregular, the surface minutely pitted and
perforate, furnished with a scanty layer of lime, whitish or yellowish
to brick-red in color, leaving naked purple and violet spots and
patches, seated on a thin membranaceous brick-red hypothallus. Sporangia
long, narrow, and sinuous, closely packed together; the walls a thin
violaceous membrane, rugulose and iridescent, with scattered granules,
or nearly destitute of lime. Capillitium of slender violet tubules,
forming a loose net-work, with slight expansions at the angles; the
tubules with numerous rather large vesicular expansions, ellipsoid or
fusiform in shape, and scantily furnished with lime. Spores globose,
nearly smooth, pale vinous, 6&ndash;8 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old trunks in woods; not uncommon in this region. Aethalium
1&ndash;3 or more centimeters in extent, and 5&ndash;10 mm. in thickness. The
vesicles of the capillitium vary from 15&ndash;30 or sometimes to 50 mic. in
diameter, their inner surface is usually coated by a single layer of
granules of lime, they are rarely filled with lime and sometimes are
naked entirely; when dry many of them are to be found collapsed. <a href="#i123">See Plate XV. Fig. 66.</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Fuligo flava</span> Pers. Plasmodium effused lemon-yellow. Aethalium mostly
effused, irregular, the surface reticulate, pitted and perforate,
entirely naked, pale yellow to lemon-yellow and greenish-yellow, the
hypothallus thin or scarcely evident. Sporangia laterally much
compressed, flexuous, and gyrose, not everywhere grown together, but
forming a dense reticulum; the walls a thin, pellucid membrane, with a
dense layer of lemon-yellow granules of lime. Capillitium of short and
very slender tubules, sparingly branched and scarcely forming a
net-work, not expanded at the angles; the tubules very scantily
furnished with lime, in scattered, small, fusiform nodules, white or
lemon-yellow. Spores globose, very minutely warted, violaceous, 7&ndash;9 mic.
in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on mosses, old leaves, sticks, etc.; not common. Aethalia in
irregular patches 2&ndash;4 cm. or more in extent, sometimes almost reduced to
a simple plasmodiocarp. This species furnishes a clear notion of the
structure of the aethalium in the other species, on account of the
sporangia being but loosely compacted and not entirely grown together.
The <i>Fuligo vaporaria</i> Pers., of the green-houses and gardens I have
never seen; the <i>Mucor septicus</i> Linn., was thought to be the plasmodium
of this. Linnæus's description is simply "<i>Mucor unctuosus flavus.</i>" <a href="#i123">See Plate XV. Fig. 67.</a></p>

<p>§2. <span class="smcap">Aethaliopsis</span> Zopf. Aethalium small; lime abundant in the

<p>Growing on leaves, twigs, mosses, etc. Aethalium from 2 or 3 mm. to a
centimeter or more in extent. I have a specimen of <i>Fuligo simulans</i>
Karsten, from Karsten himself; it is identical with my specimens of
<i>Fuligo ochracea</i> Peck. There could be no better representation of these

<p>Growing on old leaves, herbaceous stems, etc. I find it most abundantly
about the horse barn, upon the old straw and manure, sometimes running
out onto the green herbage. Aethalium from a few millimeters to several
centimeters in extent. Upon the testimony of Dr. Geo. A. Rex this is
both <i>Enteridium cinereum</i> and <i>Lachnobolus cinereus</i> of Schweinitz's
<i>North American Fungi</i> as represented in his herbarium. It is <i>Physarum
ellipsosporum</i> of Rostafinski. It is no doubt also <i>Aethaliopsis
stercoriformis</i> Zopf. <a href="#i123">See Plate XV. Fig. 68.</a></p>


<p class="break">IX. BADHAMIA Berk. Sporangia large, subglobose or obovoid, sometimes
depressed, substipitate or sessile; the wall a thin membrane, with an
outer layer of minute roundish granules of lime, irregularly dehiscent.
Stipe poorly developed, sometimes a mere strip of the hypothallus, often
wanting. Capillitium of thick tubules, attached on all sides to the wall
of the sporangium, combined into a net-work of large meshes, more or
less expanded at the angles; the tubules containing minute roundish
granules of lime throughout their whole extent. Spores large,
subglobose, dark violaceous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>The peculiar character of this genus is that the granules of lime are
distributed along the whole interior of the tubules of the capillitium;
this makes the net-work rigid, and on this account a firmer support for
the wall of the sporangium.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Badhamia capsulifera</span> Bull. Sporangia subglobose or obovoid, sessile,
on a thin pallid or yellowish hypothallus, which sometimes sends out
narrow bands or strings of membrane of variable length, bearing
sporangia singly or in clusters. Wall of the sporangium a thin pellucid
membrane, mostly even or somewhat rugulose and iridescent, coated by a
very thin layer of white granules of lime. Capillitium of rather slender
tubules, forming an open net-work of very large meshes, only slightly
expanded at the angles; the tubules coated within by a very thin layer
of white granules of lime. Spores subglobose or obovoid, adhering
together in clusters of six to twenty or more, distinctly warted on the
outer exposed surface, dark violaceous, 10&ndash;13 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old bark, leaves, etc. Sporangia .8&ndash;1.4 mm. in diameter.
<i>Badhamia hyalina</i> and <i>B. capsulifera</i> of Rostafinski's monograph are
here included together; he distinguished the former by the "sporangia in
clusters always exactly globose," a distinction first made by
Chevallier; otherwise the characters are the same in both.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Badhamia utricularis</span> Bull. Sporangia subglobose or obovoid, sessile,
on a thin pallid or yellowish hypothallus, which often separates into
narrow strips and strings of membrane of variable length, bearing the

violaceous membrane, rugulose and iridescent, shining with purple, blue,

Capillitium of thick tubules, forming an open net-work of large meshes,
more or less expanded at the angles, the tubules coated within by a thin

<p>Growing on old wood, bark, herbaceous stems, etc. Sporangia .5&ndash;1.0 mm.

preceding species in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> regard to the spores holds good so far as my
specimens are concerned. <i>Badhamia magna</i> Peck, I have never seen.

reduced to merely a thickened blackish base to the sporangium.
Capillitium of thick tubules, forming an open net-work of large meshes,
more or less expanded at the angles; the tubules with an inner lining of
very minute white granules of lime. Spores adhering together in clusters
of six to twenty, each spore subobovoid, the free portion more
distinctly warted, 10&ndash;12 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old wood, bark, etc. Sporangia .6&ndash;1.0 mm. in diameter.
Readily distinguished by its black base or black stipe and the elegant
clusters of its spores, which stick together most persistently. <a href="#i123">See Plate XV. Fig. 69.</a></p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Badhamia orbiculata</span> Rex. Sporangia much depressed, orbicular or
somewhat irregular, umbilicate often both above and below, gregarious,
sometimes growing close together and confluent, stipitate or sessile.
The wall a thin pellucid membrane, with a thin layer of minute granules
of lime, which are sometimes raised into small scales and fine ridges.
Stipe very short, black, sometimes reduced to merely a blackish base to
the sporangium. Capillitium of thick tubules, forming a scanty irregular
net-work, with wide expansions at the angles; the tubules filled with
white granules of lime. Spores subglobose, very minutely warted, dark
violaceous, 12&ndash;15 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old bark, herbaceous stems, etc. Sporangia .4-.8 mm. in
diameter, sometimes by confluence larger. This species seems near
<i>Badhamia verna</i> Smfdt, but the latter everywhere is described as
sessile, while in the former the short black stipe is nearly always
distinguishable.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Badhamia affinis</span> Rost. Sporangium hemispherical, or much depressed,
the base flattened or umbilicate, stipitate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> erect or often cernuous;
the wall a thin pellucid membrane, coated with minute white granules of
lime, which are frequently raised into scales and ridges. Stipe short,
erect or bent at the apex, black, expanding at the base into a small
hypothallus. Capillitium of thick tubules, forming an open net-work of
large meshes, more or less expanded at the angles; the tubules filled
with white granules of lime. Spores subglobose, minutely warted, dark
violaceous, 14&ndash;18 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on mosses and upon the bark of maple trunks. Sporangium .6&ndash;1.0
mm. in diameter, the stipe about the same length. Rostafinski's
description is based upon a specimen found in Chili, South America, by
Bertero; it is recorded in this country by Peck. I find it in some
seasons quite abundant. The spores are very large, in some specimens
averaging 17 mic. <a href="#i123">See Plate XV. Fig. 70.</a></p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">Badhamia decipiens</span> Curtis. Sporangia gregarious, sessile, globose,
oval or oblong, by confluence sometimes more elongated; the wall a
somewhat thickened and firm yellow or yellow-brown membrane, covered
with large, thick scales of lime, tawny to golden yellow or orange in
color. Capillitium of thick tubules, forming an open network, more or
less expanded at the angles; the tubules filled throughout with yellow
granules of lime. Spores globose, very minutely warted, lilac, 10&ndash;12
mic. in diameter. <a href="#i123">See Plate XV. Fig. 71.</a></p>

<p>Growing on old wood and bark. Sporangia .6&ndash;1.0 mm. in length by .6-.7
mm. in thickness. My specimens were determined by Dr. George A. Rex by
comparison with a specimen from Curtis in the herbarium of the
Philadelphia Academy of Sciences. This species should not be confused
with what we have described as <i>Physarum serpula</i>. <i>Physarum
chrysotrichum</i> B. &amp; C., is no doubt the same thing. <i>Badhamia nitens</i>
Berk., which is also golden yellow, has not yet been found in this
country; it will readily be distinguished from the present species by
its clustered spores.</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap">Badhamia panicea</span> Fr. Sporangia sessile, subglobose or oblong, more or
less irregular, gregarious; the wall a thin, pellucid membrane, covered
with large, irregular, very thick, white scales of lime. Capillitium of
thick tubules, forming a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> loose net-work of rather small meshes, with
wide expansions at the angles; the tubules filled with white granules of
lime, sometimes confluent toward the base of the sporangium. Spores
subglobose, very minutely warted, dark violaceous, 11&ndash;14 mic. in
diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old wood, bark, leaves, etc. Sporangia .8&ndash;1.6 mm. in length,
with a thickness of .7&ndash;1.0 mm. This species appears to be rare; the only
specimens known to me in this country I have from Professor Thos. A.
Williams, of South Dakota; they are identical with European specimens
received from Lister. <i>Physarum paniceum</i> Fries, S. M., III, p. 141; it
approaches <i>Physarum cinereum</i> Batsch.</p>

<p>8. <span class="smcap">Badhamia lilacina</span> Fr. Sporangia globose or obovoid, sessile or rarely
substipitate, closely crowded together on a thin, brownish hypothallus;
the wall a firm, hyaline membrane, with a thick, smooth, continuous
outer-layer of lime, varying in color from gray-white or drab to lilac
and flesh color. Capillitium of very thick tubules, forming a dense
net-work of small meshes; the tubules stuffed with granules of lime,
which are white or colored somewhat as those in the wall, often
confluent in the center of the sporangium. Spores globose, minutely
warted, dark violaceous, 11&ndash;14 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on wood, leaves, mosses, etc. Sporangium .5-.7 mm. in diameter.
The outer crustaceous layer of lime on the wall crumbles and falls away,
as in some species of <i>Diderma</i>. The white form is <i>Diderma concinnum</i>
B. &amp; C.; the lilac or flesh-colored form is <i>Physarum lilacinum</i> of
Fries, S. M., p. 141. I have seen it colored only white and drab. Under
a high magnifying power the sculpturing of the spores is seen to be
peculiar.</p>


<p class="break">X. SCYPHIUM Rost. Sporangium obovoid to oblong-obovoid, stipitate or
subsessile; the wall a thickened, brownish membrane, the surface
entirely naked or only the upper portion covered with granules of lime,
breaking up irregularly about the apex. Stipe variable in length,
arising from a common hypothallus and prolonged within the sporangium as
a columella. Capillitium of thick tubules, proceeding from numerous
points of the columella and forming a dense net<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>work; the tubules filled
with lime throughout their whole extent. Spores large, subglobose, dark
reddish-brown.</p>

<p>This genus differs from <i>Badhamia</i> by the columella which gives origin
to the capillitium. The sporangia in the species composing it, resemble
those of <i>Craterium</i>, and to this genus they are referred by Massee, but
the capillitium is that of <i>Badhamia</i>.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Scyphium rubiginosum</span> Chev. Sporangia gregarious, obovoid, stipitate;
the wall a thickened reddish-brown membrane, the upper part covered by a
thin layer of white granules of lime, the lower basal portion naked,
strongly venulose and more persistent. Stipe long, erect, reddish-brown,
expanding at the base into a brown hypothallus, prolonged within the
sporangium to more than half its height as a columella. Capillitium of
thick tubules, forming a dense net-work of small meshes; the tubules
stuffed with white granules of lime. Spores irregularly globose,
minutely warted, dark reddish-brown, 12&ndash;15 mic. in diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old wood, mosses, etc. Sporangia .6-.8 mm. in height by .5-.6
mm. in diameter, the stipe from once to twice the height of the
sporangium. This is <i>Physarum rubiginosum</i> Chevallier, <i>Flor de Paris</i>.
It is also <i>Craterium obovatum</i> Peck. <a href="#i123">See Plate XV. Fig. 72.</a></p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Scyphium curtisii</span> Berk. Sporangia oblong-obovoid, stipitate or
subsessile, usually growing in clusters; the wall a thick, firm,
reddish-brown membrane, venulose and reticulate, nearly destitute of
lime. Stipes variable, commonly very short, sometimes confluent, arising
from a brown hypothallus, prolonged within the sporangium to about half
its height. Capillitium of thick tubules, forming a dense network of
small meshes; the tubules stuffed with white granules of lime. Spores
irregularly globose, minutely warted, dark reddish-brown, 12&ndash;15 mic. in
diameter.</p>

<p>Growing on old wood, leaves, grass, etc. Sporangium .4-.7 mm. in height
by .3-.4 mm. in diameter, the stipe often reduced to a mere point or
cushion on the hypothallus, and varying thence to nearly the length of
the sporangium. The sporangium is narrower than in the preceding
species, and the brown wall is usually without granules of lime. It is
<i>Didymium curtisii</i> Berk. Rostafinski and Massee both preserve it
distinct from <i>S. rubiginosum</i>. <a href="#i123">See Plate XV. Fig. 73.</a></p>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
