<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SCENE</span>.&mdash;<i>Room next to</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL'S</span> <i>studio. At the back of the
stage to the L. is a glass door with portière towards the
stage. When this door is opened one can see the studio.
Bach of the stage to the R. a fireplace with burning
fire. Round the fireplace an elevation about half a yard
high reaching into the middle of the room. This elevation
is bordered by a wooden railing with an opening on each
side&mdash;in the middle of the railing an ancient Gothic chair,
with back towards the public; the back of the chair must be
so high that a person sitting in it cannot be seen by the
public. On the R. a door leading into the entrance hall of
the apartment. There is a little invisible door covered as
the rest of the room, with wall paper, on the L. near the
footlights. About a yard from this door, a settee with the
head end towards the glass door of the studio. Next to this
settee a small, ancient table, about one yard high. On the
L. a curio cabinet (small); next to it a hall stand with
some shawls of different colors. On L. next the settee a
large, gilded, stand-up candelabra, as used in churches.</i></p>

<p><i>There are many sketches, framed and unframed, about the
room&mdash;some statues, some heads, and a very elegant electric
candelabra hanging in the middle of the room. The whole
thing unharmonious but artistic. Down stage on the R. a
medium-sized table littered with books, magazines and
bric-à-brac; a large palette lies on the top of some books
and scattered among the other things some tubes of paint
and paint brushes.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>When the Curtain rises the stage is empty for a
few minutes.</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span>, <i>comes in with hat and overcoat which he takes off</i></p>

<p>Heinrich! Heinrich!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HEINRICH</span></span>, <i>coming from studio</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>Where were you?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HEINRICH</span></p>

<p>Nowhere, sir.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>The door is wide open; anybody could have walked in.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HEINRICH</span> <i>goes into the studio and comes out
with a velvet house-jacket. Calling after him:</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Where's today's paper?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He finds the newspaper.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Well, hurry up.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HEINRICH</span> <i>comes back and helps</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span> <i>put on his
jacket.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span>, <i>lights a cigarette</i></p>

<p>Did you take my dress suit to be pressed?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HEINRICH</span></p>

<p>Yes, sir: he will bring it back in an hour.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Starts R.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>Good! Here's a crown. Get me a white tie, same as the last
one.</p>

<p>[<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HEINRICH</span> <i>starts R.</i></p>

<p>Hold on! Put out a dress shirt on the bed, then look for my
pearl buttons&mdash;they are probably in the top drawer&mdash;in a
match-box. Stop! Give me that crown. Take this.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Gives him a bill.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Get me a pair of white gloves, seven and a half. Oh! and
Heinrich, before you go, put the Venetian chair next to the
window. At three o'clock Mrs. Zanden will be here to have
her portrait painted, and I shall be at home to nobody.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Reclines on the settee.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Give me an ash tray.</p>

<p>[<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HEINRICH</span> <i>gives it to him.</i></p>

<p>All right; go along.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HEINRICH</span></p>

<p>Beg your pardon, sir&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span>, <i>seated on couch L.</i></p>

<p>What is it?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HEINRICH</span></p>

<p>Mimi is here.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>Where?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HEINRICH</span></p>

<p>Waiting in the studio.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span>, <i>indifferent, reading newspaper</i></p>

<p>Send her away.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HEINRICH</span>, <i>goes to the glass door</i></p>

<p>Fräulein, Herr Marler does not need you today.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Exit L.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MIMI</span>, <i>coming in</i></p>

<p>Hallo.</p>

<p>[<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span> <i>is silent, continues reading his paper.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MIMI</span> <i>comes down L.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Don't you want to work today?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Continues reading paper.</i></p>

<p>[<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HEINRICH</span> <i>goes into the studio.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MIMI</span>, <i>in bad humor, crosses to C.</i></p>

<p>Good-bye.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Turns around.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>And tomorrow?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MIMI</span>, <i>sad</i></p>

<p>Good-bye. (<i>Wipes her eyes.</i>) You don't love me any more
... you don't love me any more.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>Oh! It's going to start again!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MIMI</span></p>

<p>Ever since last fall you've been different. I knew it right
away when you started to paint landscapes. When you are in
love you paint Venuses. I know what it means when you start
to paint trees.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>You're silly, Mimi.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MIMI</span></p>

<p>I know it. With her hat and coat on every model is silly.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>Go home, Mimi.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MIMI</span>, <i>goes to head of couch</i></p>

<p>Yes, yes. Go home! Be a good girl. For a week now you've
sent me home without my even taking my gloves off. I'm no
use any more.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Begins to cry but stops it at once.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Look here: I know everything.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>Really?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MIMI</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>From behind him, raises his head.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Look at me! Look at me! You want to get married? Tell me
No&mdash;you don't dare.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MIMI</span>, <i>comes to L. of him</i></p>

<p>Oh, you tell me anything you want to my face; but I know
you're going to marry a girl named Elsa&mdash;the wife of your
friend Mr. Zanden has arranged everything&mdash;look at me
and deny it, if you dare. After all, what's the use! you
wouldn't tell me the truth anyway.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>You little mind-reader.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MIMI</span></p>

<p>She's a nice one, Mrs. Zanden! Instead of taking you on
herself, she marries you to a friend of hers. But I don't
care; you don't love me any more&mdash;doing landscapes all the
time.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>Well, what do you want?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MIMI</span>, <i>crosses to R. of him and kneels</i></p>

<p>Tell me you do love me. (<i>Pouting</i>.)</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span>, <i>bored</i></p>

<p>Yes, yes&mdash;of course.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MIMI</span>, <i>imitating him</i></p>

<p>Yes, yes, of course. Is that the best you can do?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>Well, what shall I say?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MIMI</span></p>

<p>Oh! You painters! It's always the same. First you say:
"What an angel! What a Madonna! What a Venus! What color!
What hair! What lines!" Then all of a sudden, it's: "Oh, my
dear! Why, you've gone yellow." The next day you're green,
and then it's: "I have no time today." And, first thing you
know, you're&mdash;pooh! Landscapes. (<i>Scornfully</i>.)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>She goes to him above table at head of couch,
takes his head in her hands.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Don't you <i>like</i> me?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span>, smiling</p>

<p>Why, yes.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MIMI</span></p>

<p>If you were really nice, you would at least promise to
marry me. All the other artists promised. They weren't so
mean as you are! Oh yes, I know I am annoying you. I'm
absolutely boring you.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>If you were not such a dear little nuisance&mdash; [<i>Reaches up
and draws her down to him.</i> &mdash;I would have done with you a
long time ago.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Kisses her.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>And now, run away, little girl: go home.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MIMI</span></p>

<p>Don't you want me tomorrow? or the day after tomorrow?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MIMI</span>, <i>crossing to him at couch</i></p>

<p>You will never have me pose any more for you at all?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span>, <i>rises; crosses with her to door R.</i></p>

<p>I'll look in on you this evening on my way to the Zandens'.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MIMI</span></p>

<p>But you can't work in my house. I've only a lamp!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>Ha! Ha! Ha! Well, we'll put that out!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Has taken her to the door.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MIMI</span></p>

<p>Oh, will we!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Laughing.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Maybe <i>you'll</i> get put out.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>Bye, bye!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MIMI</span> <i>exits</i>.</p>

<p>[<i>Lights another cigarette&mdash;the bell rings
sharply. Calls, somewhat excited.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Heinrich! Heinrich!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HEINRICH</span>, <i>comes in from studio</i></p>

<p>Yes, sir.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Runs through the door on the R., which he
leaves open, and goes off to open the hall door.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Fixes his tie nervously, puts away newspaper,
puts out his cigarette in ash tray, and arranges
his hair. He goes towards the door through which</i>
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMAN</span> <i>and</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span> <i>enter</i>, <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HEINRICH</span> <i>closes the
door from the outside</i>, <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span> <i>bows</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Madame!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Bows silently to</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMAN</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMAN</span>, <i>in a hurry</i></p>

<p>I only came to bring Olga, my boy: I must go back at once.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span> <i>has been looking around.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span>, <i>going to C. and over to L.</i></p>

<p>So this is the famous studio.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span>, <i>looking around</i></p>

<p>Funny, isn't it? More like a junk shop.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMAN</span></p>

<p>We might have chosen another day to begin Olga's
portrait&mdash;we have waited six years, so we could just as
well have waited until tomorrow; but the preparations for
tonight's ball made Olga so nervous that I thought it
best to bring her here. You know this ball is a kind of
house-warming.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Crosses over to C.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>We were obliged to invite such a <i>lot</i> of people, to clear
off our social obligations.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMAN</span></p>

<p>I wish it was over. I hate these functions. Old Freebody,
in whose business I started, was worth ninety millions, and
he never gave a party in his life&mdash;or anything else, for
that matter. When do you want me to call for Olga?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span>, <i>R. C.</i></p>

<p>Well, it gets dark very early now: in three quarters of an
hour we won't be able to see any more.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMAN</span></p>

<p>Well, then&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span>, <i>looking at his watch</i></p>

<p>Let's say four o'clock.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span>, <i>after looking at a picture L. very closely</i></p>

<p>Who is that?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>Oh, some model.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>Wasn't that the girl we just met on the stairs?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMAN</span> <i>crosses quickly to L.</i></p>

<p>You're not jealous?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMAN</span>, <i>at door</i></p>

<p>Nothing&mdash;nothing at all.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span>, <i>tenderly</i></p>

<p>Are you frightened?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span> <i>does not answer.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Tell me.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span>, <i>nervous, confused, as if she was afraid of him</i></p>

<p>I don't know, but&mdash;I feel as if&mdash;as if&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>What do you mean?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span>, <i>trying to laugh, but very nervously</i></p>

<p>I had the same feeling once in Dresden, when my mother took
me to a boarding-school and left me there. I felt as if I
were quite alone in this wide, strange world&mdash;and now&mdash;you
know yourself. I have fought against coming here for six
years.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Looks around.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>What a queer place. I don't think I like it. [<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span> <i>crosses
C. and up laughing.</i> Strange monsters, cut off heads, and
you in the middle of all this like a wizard. While my
husband was here I did not feel it, but now these heads
seem to stare at me.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>She shivers.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>Don't be nervous&mdash;every woman I paint comes here.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span>, <i>seated on couch, quietly</i></p>

<p>And do you paint every woman that comes here?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Silence.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>Did you understand my husband just now?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>I think I did.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>He has often pretended to be jealous, but this time there
was a ring in his voice that made me feel that there was
something behind it.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>You don't really think he's jealous?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span>, <i>crosses to chair</i></p>

<p>No. But this is the first time I've been alone with you.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>Now we can talk things over. I've wanted to for a long time.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span>, <i>leans against R. back of chair</i></p>

<p>We've done well to avoid it all these years. A good
conscience is like a warm bath&mdash;one feels so comfortable in
it.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>Last Thursday, when we spoke about my painting your
portrait, you seemed embarrassed.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span>, <i>looks at him; their eyes meet</i></p>

<p>Don't let us talk about it. I don't want to.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>Don't be afraid of me. If I were not I, your fear might be
justified; but as it is, surely we can trust ourselves to
talk things over quietly. To think that seven years ago I
was a teacher in Herman's family&mdash;and I was there the day
your engagement was announced&mdash;it was the evening of the
day we&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span>, <i>puts her hand on his, softly reproaching him</i></p>

<p>Karl.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>&mdash;We kissed each other for the first time. Oh, I know. I
was only a drawing teacher&mdash;but you&mdash;what were you? Just
a poor little friend of Herman's sisters. Sometimes you
were asked to tea in their grand house. And there we met&mdash;a
beggar boy and a beggar girl at the rich man's table. Do
you wonder? And then, just as we realized what we were to
each other, one fine day Herman up and proposed to you.
Such a dazzling offer&mdash;who could blame you?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span>, <i>hurt</i></p>

<p>Please&mdash;please, Karl.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>We were two poor little souls who found one another in the
wilderness of wealth&mdash;only to lose each other. Even the
memory of that one little kiss....</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>Dear Karl, don't. We have grown up to be sensible
people&mdash;we have put it out of our thoughts.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>Oh, I know it's all over. To-day I'm&mdash;(<i>humorously</i>) the
famous painter, your husband is my friend, and though we
see one another every day, we have never spoken of it
again. I wouldn't even have the courage to ask you to sit
for your portrait. I was afraid, and I think you were
afraid. And so was your husband. And that is why until this
day&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span>, <i>steps down one pace from chair, gives him her hand</i></p>

<p>You <i>are</i> a real friend.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span>, <i>goes to her, gently</i></p>

<p>There's nothing to be afraid of.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>Oh, it was only my husband's voice&mdash;something in his manner
that frightened me. He must know what we were to one
another, though he has never made the slightest allusion
to it, not one single word in all these years. But when he
left us here alone, he seemed to feel&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Breaks off.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But there is no reason for it, is there? We are not in love
with one another, are we? And it's just lovely to think
that we have not entirely forgotten old times. Don't you
think so, Karl?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span>, <i>goes to chair</i></p>

<p>Of course I do.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>Because if we still loved one another, you would not marry,
would you?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Taking off gloves.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>Of course not.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>So you will be married and you will be very, very
happy&mdash;and I shall be happy, too, because it is my own
idea, and I have picked out a nice girl for you&mdash;pretty and
clever&mdash;</p>

<p>Last night I made a sketch of you from memory.... Oh, I've

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

motif&mdash;you are a revelation...? there is something in your
eyes....</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>Please, please, Karl, we agreed that&mdash;that&mdash;</p>

<p>I was just thinking&mdash;didn't your husband say an evening
frock?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>Yes. Herman wants me painted décolletée&mdash;in an evening
gown; just a head and shoulders, you know. I would have
preferred a street dress.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>I'm afraid I agree with Herman on that point. But have
you?... Didn't you?... Where is the dress?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

sitting.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

than the head in the first sketch.</p>

had seen you next to the croupier, and I thought I heard
you laugh when I lost. But now I remember&mdash;you stood behind
me, and when I had lost everything, you offered me, a total
stranger, a handful of louis d'or.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>You refused&mdash;beggingly.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>Yes, but&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span>, <i>continuing</i></p>

<p>You took them&mdash;protestingly.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>In five minutes I had won everything back, and 20,000
francs besides. Your gold seemed to have magic power, I
remember. When you gave it to me it seemed to burn.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>But you paid me back and invited me to supper. I had to
refuse, because I was obliged to leave for Spain the same
evening, but I promised to look you up the next time you
needed me&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>Well, if you think that I have insulted you, I should say

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>Why not?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>If I were to go now, it would be as much as to say: "Pardon
me, I fear I intrude." But if I remain, I show that I
suspect nothing.</p>

<p>How do I know? The way she turned to you just now when she
fancied herself insulted&mdash;it didn't escape me.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span> <i>takes up the ash tray and throws it
angrily on table.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>No; she doesn't love her husband. He must be either a
genius or a very common man. Marriage with them is always
unlucky. Believe me, common men live so low that women are
afraid somebody will steal in at night through the window
which they forgot to lock. And Genius, well! That lives on
the top floor&mdash;so many stairs, no elevator. Her ideal is&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>A motion of the hand, wanting to express an

<p>&mdash;the second floor.</p>

<p>This is the second time I have seen her shoulders.</p>

<p>What do you mean?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>The first time I saw them was in Paris&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Start from</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>at the Louvre&mdash;only they were on the <i>Aphrodite</i>. Am I
right?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span>, <i>crossing to large chair R. C. In bad humor</i></p>

<p>How should I know?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span>, <i>lifting himself upright, cynically</i></p>

<p>Which shoulders have you not seen?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span>, <i>angry</i></p>

<p>I've seen the Aphrodite.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span>, <i>seated on couch</i></p>

<p>Well, you may take my word. I have seen them both. And,
believe me, since Alcamenes, I have only known one sculptor
who could model such shoulders.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>Who's that?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>Good living. Such tender, soft lines are only possible for
a woman who lives exquisitely well. I take it she is the
wife of a millionaire?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span> <i>goes again towards door of studio

<p>Is she dressing?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span>, <i>nervously</i></p>

<p>I suppose so.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>Is there a looking-glass in your studio?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span>, <i>comes down L. of couch</i></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>She must be very respectable.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span> <i>looks at him astonished.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>If a lady takes as long as that to dress before a
looking-glass, she's not a&mdash;model&mdash;anyway.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span>, <i>crosses around foot of couch to table L. C.</i></p>

<p>Look here! I think your remarks are, to say the least, in
very bad taste.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span>, <i>standing erect</i></p>

<p>Do you mean that?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span>, <i>aggressively</i></p>

<p>I do.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span>, <i>patting</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL'S</span> <i>cheek</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Crosses to big chair, <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span> stares at him

<p>In a situation like this, only a very respectable man can
be so infernally stupid.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span>, <i>angry</i></p>

<p>Who?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>Your husband.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>Oh! So you weren't asleep after all.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes, I was.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Rises.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But "What's the time?" always means the husband. A woman's
intuition invariably anticipates her husband's coming by
ten minutes. If it wasn't for that ten minutes, there would
be more divorced women&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He goes and unlocks the door of the hall.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>&mdash;and less locked doors.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span> <i>crosses to L. C.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span>, <i>taking her hat</i></p>

<p>Will this never stop!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>I tried to change the subject. I started to speak about the
weather&mdash;the Exhibition&mdash;but Karl wouldn't have it.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>Karl!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>I? I haven't said a single word.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span>, <i>crosses to big chair</i></p>

<p>But your actions fairly shouted. The way you jumped up,
looked at your watch, went to the door&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span>:</p></blockquote>

<p>He was afraid, the poor fellow.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>Afraid of what?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span>, <i>to</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>That your husband would come before you had finished
dressing. I don't blame him.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span>, <i>R.</i></p>

<p>What, again!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Goes up to hat.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span>, <i>L. C.</i></p>

<p>Can't you&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>Come now! Let us be logical&mdash;let us look the situation in
the face. Enter your husband&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span> <i>comes down R.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>"Well, here I am: where is the picture?" "The picture?"</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Shrugs his shoulders.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>"There is no picture. Karl hasn't even touched a brush."
Your husband is astonished&mdash;he tries to speak&mdash;the words
stick in his throat&mdash;he gasps: "Well, if you didn't
paint, why is she dressing?" Imagine the situation! You
look at one another horribly embarrassed; Karl stammers
something, but that only makes it worse. Nothing has
happened&mdash;and yet the mischief is done. What mischief?
Appearances&mdash;appearances. They're like fly-paper. There's
no getting away from them.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Speaking to <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span>:</i></p></blockquote>

<p>You go home with your husband, and he doesn't speak&mdash;and if
you ask him: "Why don't you say something?" his blood seems
to boil. If you ask him to take a cab, he suspects that you
want to avoid meeting somebody&mdash;every word that you utter
tortures him. And if&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span>, <i>C.</i></p>

<p>And if it <i>were</i> so, we are not alone, you are here.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span>, <i>icy and cynical</i></p>

<p>Just so, I am here&mdash;one word from me would save the
situation&mdash;but&mdash;I know myself&mdash;I'm a strange, whimsical,
almost cruel man&mdash;and I'm afraid I won't say the word.
Tableau! Embarrassing silence! Then I say: "I regret that
I should have come at such an inopportune moment." I take
my hat and walk out discreetly. If necessary, I can even
stammer my excuses.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>If this is a jest, it's a cruel one.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span>, <i>bowing low</i></p>

<p>Possible, Madame&mdash;but I can do better still. Of course, if
you prefer it, I can make conversation&mdash;when your husband
comes in, I can tell him that the portrait has not been
touched and ask his pardon&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>Pardon? Pardon for what?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span>, <i>bowing</i> For having&mdash;quite accidentally&mdash;seen your

<p>Who are you?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

your fingers at my throat.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>That's because I like you. With most pretty women I take

<p>How do you know I want a new dress?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>You have a new hat&mdash;a very pretty one&mdash;and you will
certainly want a new dress to wear with it.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>You must be married.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>Married? Not the least&mdash;but I have an eye for feminine
vanities. Oh, no! A wife is like a single eyeglass&mdash;it
looks very nice, but one is better off without it.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span>, <i>R.</i></p>

<p>You seem to have strong views against marriage. May I ask
why?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span>, <i>shaking his finger</i></p>

<p>Because you are plotting matrimony against Karl, and I want
to save him.</p>

<p>I beg your pardon&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>An artist ought never to marry&mdash;his wife will swear on the
wedding day to stand by his side all through life. The day
after the wedding she will stand in his way.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>Not the real wife.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>The real wife is always the other man's wife.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>You're a cynic.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>Oh, no, not cynical, only careful. A tigress who has
married&mdash;I mean eaten&mdash;a man, is no longer dangerous&mdash;you
can ride on her back through the jungle. But, you must wait
till she has married&mdash;I mean eaten&mdash;somebody; then she is
quite safe.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>Better to keep away from the tigress&mdash;and stay at home.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>Then why didn't <i>you</i> stay at home P Why did you refuse
a legitimate position&mdash;good, everyday morals&mdash;a decent
occupation at so much a week? You wanted to go into the
jungle&mdash;and there you are. Now fight your battle&mdash;hunt
tigers&mdash;but don't get married!</p>

<p>It's not a base thought: it's a great thought&mdash;a thought
that brings joy and warmth and light into your wretched
little lives. But joy has its price&mdash;and you must pay it,
you misers! The drunkard dies of drink, but while he is
drunk angels in heaven sing to him. The poet dies in the
ecstasy of his sweetest song. It is a coward's bravery that
turns away from the wine, the song&mdash;and the lips of woman.
The smallest candle-end shows you it is worth while to burn
up for the sake of a little warmth&mdash;a little light. The
only end of life is to burn&mdash;to burn yourself up. You must
flame and blaze like a torch and toss the fire about you.
I know: your moralists tell you to love one another&mdash;don't
believe them&mdash;your grubby little earth with its paltry
million years is not ripe for such a love as that. It can
only breed monks, madmen, Methodists. Don't be a fool, be
a rogue&mdash;but be a jolly rogue&mdash;and the world is yours!
Look at me! I own the earth. Here is the key of life&mdash;Love
yourself&mdash;only yourself. Dress yourself in the softest
garments&mdash;kiss the sweetest lips&mdash;drink of the wine of
Life&mdash;Drink! Drink! Drink!</p>

to come to our house this evening?</p>

<p>Well, but if pressing business....</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span>, <i>L. C.</i></p>

<p>It is not so very pressing. Of course, it would mean a

the most famous portrait painter in all Europe.</p>

Mimi. What do you say?</p>

<p>Last fall, on the sixth of September&mdash;I shall never forget
the date&mdash;something strange happened to me. I put on an old
suit I hadn't worn for a long time, and as I picked up the
waistcoat, a sovereign fell out. God knows how long it had
been there. As I turned this sovereign over to look at it,
it suddenly slipped through my fingers and rolled away.
I looked and looked, but my sovereign was gone. I become
nervous: I can't find the sovereign. I search around for
half an hour, three quarters of an hour, still I can't find
it. I get angry, I get furious. I shift the furniture&mdash;no
sovereign. I call my man&mdash;we both look everywhere until
it's dark. I'm perspiring and trembling&mdash;I have but one
idea: I must get that sovereign back. Suddenly a suspicion
comes into my mind&mdash;I get up from my knees. I scream at the
top of my voice to my servant: "You thief, you have found
the sovereign and put it into your pocket." The man gets
angry and answers me disrespectfully. I am about to strike
him when I see the blade of a knife shining in his hands. I
draw my revolver&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Takes a shining revolver out of his pocket and
rises.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>&mdash;and with this revolver I nearly killed a man for a
sovereign&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Look from <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span>.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>&mdash;I didn't need and had never missed&mdash;just a found
sovereign.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Puts revolver on table.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span>, <i>embarrassed</i></p>

<p>I give found money away.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Turns on couch from him.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>I would have given it away, but&mdash;it slipped through my
fingers, and whatever slips through our fingers, that is
just the one thing we want.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Goes to</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>We break our necks for it: that's human nature. And if it
once slips through your fingers, you will run after your
found sovereign. And then, when it is too late, you will
discover it was worth having.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>To draw a revolver for a found sovereign?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span>, <i>sitting by him</i></p>

<p>And that little woman will become dearer and more precious
to you every day&mdash;you will realize that she could have
given you wings&mdash;that her temperament, her beauty, her
passion, would have been the inspiration of your work&mdash; all
this you'll realize when she has slipped away. You could
have become a master&mdash;a giant! Not by loving your art,
but by loving her&mdash;but you won't know it till it is too
late&mdash;too late.</p>

<h4>CURTAIN</h4>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3><a name="ACT_II" id="ACT_II">ACT II</a></h3>


<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SCENE</span>.&mdash;<i>A conservatory in Zanden's house. The L. side of
the stage as well as the whole back of the stage is taken
up by large bay windows, through which one sees into the
garden. In the distance the wall surrounding the house, and
some trees in the garden. It is winter. Bright weather,
but it has been snowing. In the garden as well as in the
street, electric lamps. On the R. side of the stage there
are two doors, one quite near to the footlights, leading
into the apartment&mdash;one in the rear, leading to the hall.
There is a platform about two yards long and two yards
wide, between these two doors. Five steps lead from this
platform towards the footlights, and five steps on the
side of the platform to the middle of the stage. On the
top of the platform a door leading to the ball-room. When
this door is opened, one generally hears the ball music.
At the foot of the stairs, about three yards from the
footlights, two square columns having a brass ornament with
eight electric lamps attached. There are heaps of plants
and flowers about the room. Two chairs and a table stand
on the R. side of the stage, about three yards from the
footlights, two chairs and a table on the L. side of the
stage, about five yards from the footlights. There are two
settees, L. and R. On the table L. writing material. It is
about one o'clock at night.</i></p>

the Curtain goes up.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Who is the dark man you left so suddenly in the ball room?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SECOND LADY GUEST</span>, <i>enters and comes down stairs to back of
table L.</i></p>

<p>I don't know his name.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FIRST LADY GUEST</span></p>

<p>A most disagreeable man.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SECOND LADY GUEST</span>, <i>crosses to group L. C.</i></p>

<p>Oh, dreadful! He behaved shockingly to my husband. He told
him that it will be so cold tonight that his teeth will
shiver in their box.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FIRST LADY GUEST</span></p>

<p>Olga tells me he is a friend of Herr Karl's, and she only
invited him as a compliment to him.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SECOND LADY GUEST</span> (<i>stout</i>)</p>

<p>He insisted on telling me of a remedy for obesity. I don't
consider myself stout&mdash;do you?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ELSA</span>, <i>C., laughingly</i></p>

<p>No! I think I'm just right. He sounds interesting&mdash;I'd like
to meet him.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FIRST LADY GUEST</span></p>

<p>You'll be sorry if you do.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ELSA</span></p>

<p>Oh, indeed.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SECOND LADY GUEST</span></p>

<p>He'll be very disagreeable, I assure you.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ELSA</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SECOND LADY GUEST</span></p>

<p>If Miss Elsa wants to speak to him let her do so. I think
she is the only one really capable of putting him in his
place.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THIRD LADY GUEST</span>, <i>seated L. of table R.</i></p>

<p>Oh, she'll make him sit up.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ELSA</span></p>

<p>Thanks, awfully. Oh, I know what you call me&mdash;the
blue-stocking&mdash;sassy Elsa&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SECOND LADY GUEST</span></p>

<p>Elsa, I never said you were a blue-stocking.</p>

<p>I never called you Sassy Elsa.</p>

<p>You must show a bold front&mdash;you will perhaps feel that it
is hard for a young girl to fight a woman&mdash;your weapons are
not quite so numerous as those of the married woman&mdash;who
knows love already&mdash;who understands&mdash;may I say something

<p>Well, I won't. But remember, you have one weapon which will
deal the death blow to the most attractive woman&mdash;to the
woman who knows every card in the game of love&mdash;that one
weapon is purity.</p>

<p>All the same&mdash;it may do you some good. And now&mdash;go dance

man as if you were only waiting for a pirate to steal you
away from girl-land&mdash;and show you the way into Woman's

dares to call you saucy again, tell him that you once met a
gentleman at a ball to whom you thought to give a piece of
your mind, that would make him feel very, very small&mdash;and

pride in the success of your scheme. Am I right?</p>

<p>Karl shall tell us himself which was the real thing
&mdash;the attempted murder of this afternoon, or this
little&mdash;flirtation with Elsa.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>You don't mean to ask him&mdash;</p>

<p>[<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span> <i>shakes his head slowly, smiling.</i></p>

<p>you don't mean to <i>listen</i>?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>Certainly not.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>What then?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>Very simple. But you must take my advice
unconditionally&mdash;ask for no reasons&mdash;do exactly what I tell
you.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span>, <i>after careful reflection, slowly</i></p>

<p>Y-e-s.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>I think I remember having seen you once at the Opera in a
very beautiful cloak&mdash;fur&mdash;was it not?&mdash;and cloth&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>With a long train? You must put that cloak on&mdash;close it as
high as you can&mdash;and wrap yourself in it as if you were
feeling cold. Only show the tips of your shoes&mdash;then come
back here&mdash;</p>

<p>There is a lady, sir.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>What kind of a lady?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HEINRICH</span></p>

<p>A real lady, sir.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>What does she want?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HEINRICH</span></p>

<p>She wants to see my master. I told her he was not up yet,
but she said she would wait.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>Do you know who the lady is? Have you seen her before?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HEINRICH</span></p>

<p>Never.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>Ah!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ELSA</span></p>

<p>You seem to be everywhere. What are you doing here? Are you
his secretary?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>No, merely a good friend. Nothing else. I just happened in.
By the way, how do you do?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ELSA</span></p>

<p>How do you do?</p>

<p>Karl is expecting you, then?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ELSA</span></p>

<p>Oh, no.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>Will you permit me to prepare him for this pleasant
surprise?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ELSA</span></p>

<p>No, thank you. Don't disturb him. I can look around while
I'm waiting. I have never been here before.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>I know it.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ELSA</span></p>

<p>Who told you?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>The man&mdash;a lady might come every day and escape notice&mdash;but
coming for the first time she would be sure to attract his
attention.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ELSA</span></p>

<p>I feel embarrassed coming here alone.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>I know that, too.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ELSA</span></p>

<p>From the same source?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>Yes; he said you were a real lady.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ELSA</span></p>

<p>He is the only one here who has spoken to me like a
gentleman.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>He must have thought you were a model.</p>

<p>How dare you?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>A servant can only speak like a gentleman to&mdash;his equals.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ELSA</span>, <i>sits down again; sarcastically</i></p>

<p>Then I was mistaken&mdash;it is not Heinrich who is the servant.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>Who knows&mdash;perhaps he is a clergyman.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ELSA</span></p>

<p>I don't understand you.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>Only two people in the world may open the door of a
bachelor's apartment to a young lady&mdash;the man servant, or a
clergyman with a marriage certificate &mdash;you can take your
choice.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ELSA</span></p>

<p>Let me tell you I was once left alone with a gentleman who
tried to kiss me, and I slapped his face.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>Indeed? I was once left alone with a lady who tried to slap
me and I <i>kissed</i> her face.</p>

<p>Don't be afraid. This is not my day for crying.</p>

<p>It's when a girl laughs that I'm most afraid.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ELSA</span></p>

<p>I intend to sit for my portrait&mdash;to do that, I must come
every day.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>You intend to come here every day, and to do that you must
have your portrait painted.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ELSA</span></p>

<p>You are clever at twisting words.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>Perhaps you know there is another lady coming every day to
have her portrait painted?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ELSA</span></p>

<p>Yes, I know. That's why I want mine painted&mdash;we'll see
which will be the better likeness.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>Come now&mdash;you must let me sit down&mdash;this time I want you to
be right.</p>

<p>This is awful&mdash;you question me like a judge.</p>

<p>And you still mean to fight?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ELSA</span></p>

<p>Yes, I mean to fight&mdash;you gave me good advice.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>That was yesterday.</p>

<p>Well&mdash;this is to-day.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span>, <i>impressively</i></p>

<p>Yesterday was your winning day. Yesterday it was written

your mind to do, with the whole strength of your will.</p>

<p>I know your name. I've heard it often. You belong to a very

<p>Yes, indeed it does. But that's all over now</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ELSA</span></p>

<p>Why so?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MIMI</span></p>

<p>Because he is going to get married</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ELSA</span></p>

<p>But he will paint just the same&mdash;he will want models.</p>

<p>Does he paint you now?</p>

<p>Then you did not come to pose to-day?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MIMI</span></p>

her fault&mdash;and&mdash;</p>

people are all refined&mdash;I wasn't born a model.</p>

<p>Come over here, Mimi; I want to talk to you.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MIMI</span>, goes over and sits on the couch</p>

<p>You can talk to me about everything, I'm not a bad sort,
really I'm not. I've known all along about Herr Karl
and&mdash;and you&mdash;he's such a kind man. I was crying when
I went away yesterday, and he felt sorry for me and he
came to see me on his way to the ball&mdash;in his evening
clothes&mdash;but I didn't receive him. If it's over, it may as
well be over.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ELSA</span></p>

<p>Was he fond of you?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MIMI</span></p>

<p>I loved him, but what's the use? It's like the railway
&mdash;the station is there and the train comes and then the
train goes away, and the station cannot run after it; if
the station is small, the train only stops a minute, and&mdash;</p>

<p>You loved him and can speak like that?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MIMI</span></p>

<p>Yes, I loved him, but it's all over now. I was foolish to
come here again when I'd made up my mind I wouldn't, but
now I'm sensible again; I'll go away and try to forget him,
I hope he will be&mdash;hap-hap&mdash;happy!</p>

<p>It's almost three o'clock.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MIMI</span></p>

<p>Three o'clock! Then I must hurry. I have an appointment at
half past&mdash;he's an illustrator&mdash;such a talented boy; he's
just had a picture accepted by the <i>Fleigende Blatter</i>.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ELSA</span></p>

<p>And you are posing for him?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MIMI</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes; but tonight he goes to the artists' dinner, and I
have to find his dress studs, and iron a tie for him, and
trim his cuffs.</p>

<p>Yes, sir.</p>

<p>I'll have some with my tea. Is your master getting up?</p>

<p>Mrs. Zanden's maid has been here three times.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>What did she want?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HEINRICH</span></p>

<p>She inquired whether Mrs. Zanden could see my master. I
told her I had strict orders not to call him before three.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>Hurry with the tea.</p>

<p>My maid told me I could not see him until three&mdash;it is
three o'clock now.</p>

<p>I am very sorry, Madame, but you will have to wait a few

<p>No, Madame.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>Didn't anyone leave a letter for him?</p>

will tell the doctor&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>What doctor?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HEINRICH</span></p>

<p>The gentleman who was here with you yesterday.</p>

<p>Dr. Miller? <i>He</i>&mdash;is&mdash;in&mdash;there?</p>

<p>Yes, Madame.</p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HEINRICH</span>, <i>reluctantly</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Did you see Dr. Miller give a letter to your master? A
piece of paper?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HEINRICH</span></p>

<p>Possibly, Madame, but I don't remember.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>Tell Dr. Miller to come at once. Say a lady wishes to speak
to him, but don't give him my name.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HEINRICH</span> <i>goes out</i>.</p>

<p>Are you the lady who wishes to see me at once?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>Oh, tell me&mdash;did you&mdash;have you...?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>[<i>Is busy with his tea.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Now standing behind <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span>, tea cup in his hand.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>After he read it, he buried his face in the pillow and
cried.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>He cried?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>I hate men who cry.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>I did not want him to have that letter. I wanted to speak
to him first. I wanted to ask him to give me my letter back
unopened I am too late.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>You were not too late. It's I that was too early.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>He cried?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>From joy.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>I haven't the courage to speak to him, and yet I feel that
I must. I would like to go away, but something holds me;
something I cannot&mdash;I cannot&mdash;oh, what will become of me?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HEINRICH</span>, <i>at door</i></p>

<p>My master will be here in a moment, sir.</p>

<p>[<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HEINRICH</span> <i>goes out.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>I must be going.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>Don't go! Please stay. I don't want to be alone with him.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEVIL</span></p>

<p>But if I am here you cannot speak to him about the letter.
I shall only be in the way.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span>, <i>very weak</i></p>

<p>Very well, then, I shall speak to him quite frankly. I

<p>Please stay.</p>

what I did last night.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>Speak low&mdash;Dr. Miller is in there.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>Olga&mdash;can you ever&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>No, no; it is I who should ask forgiveness I was to blame.
I lost control of myself. After what happened, I wanted to
know&mdash;I wanted to make sure&mdash;but, you understand now, my
letter has told you everything.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>What letter?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span>, <i>reproachfully</i></p>

<p>Karl, I understand. You want to spare me&mdash;you're being
discreet; but you don't know me; I mean every word of that
letter, I'm glad I wrote it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>But I didn't get any letter.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OLGA</span></p>

<p>Didn't Doctor Miller give you a letter?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KARL</span></p>

<p>No, no; really. </p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
