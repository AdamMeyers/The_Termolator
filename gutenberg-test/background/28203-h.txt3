CHAPTER I.

IN A YEAR.


The room fronted the west, but a black cloud, barred[7]
with red, robbed the hour of twilight's tranquil charm.
Shadows haunted it, lurking in corners like spies set there
to watch the man who stood among them mute and motionless
as if himself a shadow. His eye turned often to the
window with a glance both vigilant and eager, yet saw
nothing but a tropical luxuriance of foliage scarcely stirred
by the sultry air heavy with odors that seemed to oppress
not refresh. He listened with the same intentness, yet
heard only the clamor of voices, the tramp of feet, the
chime of bells, the varied turmoil of a city when night is
defrauded of its peace by being turned to day. He watched
and waited for something; presently it came. A viewless
visitant, welcomed by longing soul and body as the man,
with extended arms and parted lips received the voiceless
greeting of the breeze that came winging its way across
the broad Atlantic, full of healthful cheer for a home-sick
heart. Far out he leaned; held back the thick-leaved
boughs already rustling with a grateful stir, chid the shrill[8]
bird beating its flame-colored breast against its prison bars,
and drank deep draughts of the blessed wind that seemed
to cool the fever of his blood and give him back the vigor
he had lost.

A sudden light shone out behind him filling the room
with a glow that left no shadow in it. But he did not see
the change, nor hear the step that broke the hush, nor turn
to meet the woman who stood waiting for a lover's welcome.
An indefinable air of sumptuous life surrounded her, and
made the brilliant room a fitting frame for the figure standing
there with warm-hued muslins blowing in the wind.
A figure full of the affluent beauty of womanhood in its
prime, bearing unmistakable marks of the polished pupil
of the world in the grace that flowed through every motion,
the art which taught each feature to play its part with the
ease of second nature and made dress the foil to loveliness.
The face was delicate and dark as a fine bronze, a low forehead
set in shadowy waves of hair, eyes full of slumberous
fire, and a passionate yet haughty mouth that seemed
shaped alike for caresses and commands.

A moment she watched the man before her, while over
her countenance passed rapid variations of pride, resentment,
and tenderness. Then with a stealthy step, an assured
smile, she went to him and touched his hand, saying,
in a voice inured to that language which seems made for
lovers' lips       

"Only a month betrothed, and yet so cold and gloomy,
Adam!"

With a slight recoil, a glance of soft detestation veiled
and yet visible, Warwick answered like a satiric echo       

"Only a month betrothed, and yet so fond and jealous,
Ottila!"[9]

Unchilled by the action, undaunted by the look, the
white arm took him captive, the beautiful face drew nearer,
and the persuasive voice asked wistfully       

"Was it of me you thought when you turned with that
longing in your eye?"

"No."

"Was it of a fairer or a dearer friend than I?"

"Yes."

The black brows contracted ominously, the mouth grew
hard, the eyes glittered, the arm became a closer bond, the
entreaty a command.

"Let me know the name, Adam."

"Self-respect."

She laughed low to herself, and the mobile features softened
to their former tenderness as she looked up into that
other face so full of an accusing significance which she
would not understand.

"I have waited two long hours; have you no kinder
greeting, love?"

"I have no truer one. Ottila, if a man has done unwittingly
a weak, unwise, or wicked act, what should he
do when he discovers it?"

"Repent and mend his ways; need I tell you that?"

"I have repented; will you help me mend my ways?"

"Confess, dear sinner; I will shrive you and grant absolution
for the past, whatever it may be."

"How much would you do for love of me?"

"Anything for you, Adam."

"Then give me back my liberty."

He rose erect and stretched his hands to her with a gesture
of entreaty, an expression of intense desire. Ottila
fell back as if the forceful words and action swept her from[10]
him. The smile died on her lips, a foreboding fear looked
out at her eyes, and she asked incredulously       

"Do you mean it?"

"Yes; now, entirely, and forever!"

If he had lifted his strong arm and struck her, it would
not have daunted with such pale dismay. An instant she
stood like one who saw a chasm widening before her, which
she had no power to cross. Then as if disappointment was
a thing impossible and unknown, she seized the imploring
hands in a grasp that turned them white with its passionate
pressure as she cried       

"No, I will not! I have waited for your love so long
I cannot give it up; you shall not take it from me!"

But as if the words had made the deed irrevocable, Warwick
put her away, speaking with the stern accent of one
who fears a traitor in himself.

"I cannot take from you what you never had. Stand
there and hear me. No; I will have no blandishments to
keep me from my purpose, no soft words to silence the hard
ones I mean to speak, no more illusions to hide us from
each other and ourselves."

"Adam, you are cruel."

"Better seem cruel than be treacherous; better wound
your pride now than your heart hereafter, when too late you
discover that I married you without confidence, respect, or
love. For once in your life you shall hear the truth as
plain as words can make it. You shall see me at my best
as at my worst; you shall know what I have learned to find
in you; shall look back into the life behind us, forward into
the life before us, and if there be any candor in you I will
wring from you an acknowledgment that you have led me
into an unrighteous compact. Unrighteous, because you[11]
have deceived me in yourself, appealed to the baser, not the
nobler instincts in me, and on such a foundation there can
be no abiding happiness."

"Go on, I will hear you." And conscious that she could
not control the will now thoroughly aroused, Ottila bent
before it as if meekly ready to hear all things for love's
sake.

A disdainful smile passed over Warwick's face, as with
an eye that fixed and held her own, he rapidly went on,
never pausing to choose smooth phrases or soften facts, but
seeming to find a relish in the utterance of bitter truths
after the honeyed falsehood he had listened to so long. Yet
through all the harshness glowed the courage of an upright
soul, the fervor of a generous heart.

"I know little of such things and care less; but I think
few lovers pass through a scene such as this is to be, because
few have known lives like ours, or one such as we. You a
woman stronger for good or ill than those about you, I a
man untamed by any law but that of my own will. Strength
is royal, we both possess it; as kings and queens drop their
titles in their closets, let us drop all disguises and see each
other as God sees us. This compact must be broken; let
me show you why. Three months ago I came here to take
the chill of an Arctic winter out of blood and brain. I
have done so and am the worse for it. In melting frost I
have kindled fire; a fire that will burn all virtue out of me
unless I quench it at once. I mean to do so, because I will
not keep the ten commandments before men's eyes and break
them every hour in my heart."

He paused a moment, as if hotter words rose to his lips
than generosity would let him utter, and when he spoke
again there was more reproach than anger in his voice.[12]

"Ottila, till I knew you I loved no woman but my
mother; I wooed no wife, bought no mistress, desired no
friend, but led a life austere as any monk's, asking only
freedom and my work. Could you not let me keep my
independence? Were there not men enough who would
find no degradation in a spiritual slavery like this? Would
nothing but my subjection satisfy your unconquerable appetite
for power?"

"Did I seek you, Adam?"

"Yes! Not openly, I grant, your art was too fine for
that; you shunned me that I might seek you to ask why.
In interviews that seemed to come by chance, you tried
every wile a woman owns, and they are many. You wooed
me as such as you alone can woo the hearts they know are
hardest to be won. You made your society a refreshment
in this climate of the passions; you hid your real self and
feigned that for which I felt most honor. You entertained
my beliefs with largest hospitality; encouraged my ambitions
with a sympathy so genial that I thought it genuine;
professed my scorn for shammery, and seemed an earnest
woman, eager to find the true, to do the right; a fit wife
for any man who desired a helpmate, not a toy. It showed
much strength of wit and will to conceive and execute the
design. It proved your knowledge of the virtues you could
counterfeit so well, else I never should have been where I
am now."

"Your commendation is deserved, though so ungently
given, Adam."

"There will be no more of it. If I am ungentle, it is
because I despise deceit, and you possess a guile that has
given me my first taste of self-contempt, and the draught is
bitter. Hear me out; for this reminiscence is my justifica[13]tion;
you must listen to the one and accept the other.
You seemed all this, but under the honest friendliness you
showed lurked the purpose you have since avowed, to conquer
most entirely the man who denied your right to rule
by the supremacy of beauty or of sex alone. You saw the
unsuspected fascination that detained me here when my
better self said 'Go.' You allured my eye with loveliness,
my ear with music; piqued curiosity, pampered pride, and
subdued will by flatteries subtly administered. Beginning
afar off, you let all influences do their work till the moment
came for the effective stroke. Then you made a crowning
sacrifice of maiden modesty and owned you loved me."

Shame burned red on Ottila's dark cheek, and ire flamed
up in her eyes, as the untamable spirit of the woman
answered against her will       

"It was not made in vain; for, rebellious as you are, it
subdued you, and with your own weapon, the bare truth."

He had said truly, "You shall see me at my best as at
worst." She did, for putting pride underneath his feet he
showed her a brave sincerity, which she could admire but
never imitate, and in owning a defeat achieved a victory.

"You think I shall deny this. I do not, but acknowledge
to the uttermost that, in spite of all resistance, I was
conquered by a woman. If it affords you satisfaction to
hear this, to know that it is hard to say, harder still to
feel, take the ungenerous delight; I give it to you as an
alms. But remember that if I have failed, no less have
you. For in that stormy heart of yours there is no sentiment
more powerful than that you feel for me, and through
it you will receive the retribution you have brought upon
yourself. You were elated with success, and forgot too
soon the character you had so well supported. You thought[14]
love blinded me, but there was no love; and during this
month I have learned to know you as you are. A woman
of strong passions and weak principles; hungry for power
and intent on pleasure; accomplished in deceit and reckless
in trampling on the nobler instincts of a gifted but
neglected nature. Ottila, I have no faith in you, feel no
respect for the passion you inspire, own no allegiance to
the dominion you assert."

"You cannot throw it off; it is too late."

It was a rash defiance; she saw that as it passed her
lips, and would have given much to have recalled it. The
stern gravity of Warwick's face flashed into a stern indignation.
His eye shone like steel, but his voice dropped
lower and his hand closed like a vice as he said, with the
air of one who cannot conceal but can control sudden wrath
at a taunt to which past weakness gives a double sting       

"It never is too late. If the priest stood ready, and I
had sworn to marry you within the hour, I would break the
oath, and God would pardon it, for no man has a right to
embrace temptation and damn himself by a life-long lie.
You choose to make it a hard battle for me; you are
neither an honest friend nor a generous foe. No matter, I
have fallen into an ambuscade and must cut my way out
as I can, and as I will, for there is enough of this Devil's
work in the world without our adding to it."

"You cannot escape with honor, Adam."

"I cannot remain with honor. Do not try me too hardly,
Ottila. I am not patient, but I do desire to be just.
I confess my weakness; will not that satisfy you? Blazon
your wrong as you esteem it; ask sympathy of those who
see not as I see; reproach, defy, lament. I will bear it
all, will make any other sacrifice as an atonement, but I[15]
will 'hold fast mine integrity' and obey a higher law than
your world recognizes, both for your sake and my own."

She watched him as he spoke, and to herself confessed a
slavery more absolute than any he had known, for with a
pang she felt that she had indeed fallen into the snare she
spread for him, and in this man, who dared to own his
weakness and her power, she had found a master. Was it
too late to keep him? She knew that soft appeals were
vain, tears like water on a rock, and with the skill that
had subdued him once she endeavored to retrieve her blunder
by an equanimity which had more effect than prayers
or protestations. Warwick had read her well, had shown
her herself stripped of all disguises, and left her no defence
but tardy candor. She had the wisdom to see this, the wit
to use it and restore the shadow of the power whose substance
she had lost. Leaving her beauty to its silent work,
she fixed on him eyes whose lustre was quenched in unshed
tears, and said with an earnest, humble voice       

"I, too, desire to be just. I will not reproach, defy, or
lament, but leave my fate to you. I am all you say, yet
in your judgment remember mercy, and believe that at
twenty-five there is still hope for the noble but neglected
nature, still time to repair the faults of birth, education,
and orphanhood. You say, I have a daring will, a love of
conquest. Can I not will to overcome myself and do it?
Can I not learn to be the woman I have seemed? Love
has worked greater miracles, may it not work this? I
have longed to be a truer creature than I am; have seen
my wasted gifts, felt my capacity for better things, and
looked for help from many sources, but never found it till
you came. Do you wonder that I tried to make it mine?
Adam, you are a self-elected missionary to the world's[16]
afflicted; you can look beyond external poverty and see the
indigence of souls. I am a pauper in your eyes; stretch
out your hand and save me from myself."

Straight through the one vulnerable point in the man's
pride went this appeal to the man's pity. Indignation
could not turn it aside, contempt blunt its edge, or wounded
feeling lessen its force; and yet it failed: for in Adam
Warwick justice was stronger than mercy, reason than impulse,
head than heart. Experience was a teacher whom
he trusted; he had weighed this woman and found her
wanting; truth was not in her; the patient endeavor, the
hard-won success so possible to many was hardly so to her,
and a union between them could bring no lasting good to
either. He knew this; had decided it in a calmer hour
than the present, and by that decision he would now abide
proof against all attacks from without or from within.
More gently, but as inflexibly as before, he said       

"I do put out my hand and offer you the same bitter
draught of self-contempt that proved a tonic to my own
weak will. I can help, pity, and forgive you heartily, but
I dare not marry you. The tie that binds us is a passion
of the senses, not a love of the soul. You lack the moral
sentiment that makes all gifts and graces subservient to
the virtues that render womanhood a thing to honor as well
as love. I can relinquish youth, beauty, worldly advantages,
but I must reverence above all others the woman
whom I marry, and feel an affection that elevates me by
quickening all that is noblest and manliest in me. With
you I should be either a tyrant or a slave. I will be
neither, but go solitary all my life rather than rashly mortgage
the freedom kept inviolate so long, or let the impulse
of an hour mar the worth of coming years."[17]

Bent and broken by the unanswerable accusations of
what seemed a conscience in human shape, Ottila had sunk
down before him with an abandonment as native to her as
the indomitable will which still refused to relinquish hope
even in despair.

"Go," she said, "I am not worthy of salvation. Yet
it is hard, very hard, to lose the one motive strong enough
to save me, the one sincere affection of my life."

Warwick had expected a tempestuous outbreak at his
decision; this entire submission touched him, for in the
last words of her brief lament he detected the accent of
truth, and longed to answer it. He paused, searching for
the just thing to be done. Ottila, with hidden face, watched
while she wept, and waited hopefully for the relenting sign.
In silence the two, a modern Samson and Delilah, waged
the old war that has gone on ever since the strong locks
were shorn and the temple fell; a war which fills the world
with unmated pairs and the long train of evils arising from
marriages made from impulse, and not principle. As usual,
the most generous was worsted. The silence pleaded well
for Ottila, and when Warwick spoke it was to say impetuously       

"You are right! It is hard that when two err one alone
should suffer. I should have been wise enough to see the
danger, brave enough to fly from it. I was not, and I owe
you some reparation for the pain my folly brings you. I
offer you the best, because the hardest, sacrifice that I can
make. You say love can work miracles, and that yours is
the sincerest affection of your life; prove it. In three
months you conquered me; can you conquer yourself in
twelve?"

"Try me!"[18]

"I will. Nature takes a year for her harvests; I give
you the same for yours. If you will devote one half the
energy and care to this work that you devoted to that other,       will
earnestly endeavor to cherish all that is womanly
and noble in yourself, and through desire for another's
respect earn your own,       I, too, will try to make myself a
fitter mate for any woman, and keep our troth unbroken for
a year. Can I do more?"

"I dared not ask so much! I have not deserved it, but
I will. Only love me, Adam, and let me save myself
through you."

Flushed and trembling with delight she rose, sure the
trial was safely passed, but found that for herself a new
one had begun. Warwick offered his hand.

"Farewell, then."

"Going? Surely you will stay and help me through
my long probation?"

"No; if your desire has any worth you can work it out
alone. We should be hindrances to one another, and the
labor be ill done."

"Where will you go? Not far, Adam."

"Straight to the North. This luxurious life enervates
me; the pestilence of slavery lurks in the air and infects
me; I must build myself up anew and find again the man
I was."

"When must you go? Not soon."

"At once."

"I shall hear from you?"

"Not till I come."

"But I shall need encouragement, shall grow hungry
for a word, a thought from you. A year is very long to
wait and work alone."[19]

Eloquently she pleaded with voice and eyes and tender
lips, but Warwick did not yield.

"If the test be tried at all it must be fairly tried. We
must stand entirely apart and see what saving virtue lies
in self-denial and self-help."

"You will forget me, Adam. Some woman with a
calmer heart than mine will teach you to love as you desire
to love, and when my work is done it will be all in vain."

"Never in vain if it be well done, for such labor is its
own reward. Have no fear; one such lesson will last a
lifetime. Do your part heartily, and I will keep my
pledge until the year is out."

"And then, what then?"

"If I see in you the progress both should desire, if this
tie bears the test of time and absence, and we find any
basis for an abiding union, then, Ottila, I will marry you."

"But if meanwhile that colder, calmer woman comes to
you, what then?"

"Then I will not marry you."

"Ah, your promise is a man's vow, made only to be
broken. I have no faith in you."

"I think you may have. There will be no time for
more folly; I must repair the loss of many wasted days,       nay,
not wasted if I have learned this lesson well. Rest
secure; it is impossible that I should love."

"You believed that three months ago and yet you are a
lover now."

Ottila smiled an exultant smile, and Warwick acknowledged
his proven fallibility by a haughty flush and a frank
amendment.

"Let it stand, then, that if I love again I am to wait in
silence till the year is out and you absolve me from my
pledge. Does that satisfy you?"[20]

"It must. But you will come, whatever changes may
befall you? Promise me this."

"I promise it."

"Going so soon? Oh, wait a little!"

"When a duty is to be done, do it at once; delay is
dangerous. Good night."

"Give me some remembrance of you. I have nothing,
for you are not a generous lover."

"Generous in deeds, Ottila. I have given you a year's
liberty, a dear gift from one who values it more than life.
Now I add this."

He drew her to him, kissed the red mouth and looked
down upon her with a glance that made his man's face as
pitiful as any woman's as he let her lean there happy in
the hope given at such cost. For a moment nothing stirred
in the room but the soft whisper of the wind. For a moment
Warwick's austere life looked hard to him, love seemed
sweet, submission possible; for in all the world this was
the only woman who clung to him, and it was beautiful to
cherish and be cherished after years of solitude. A long
sigh of desire and regret broke from him, and at the sound
a stealthy smile touched Ottila's lips as she whispered,
with a velvet cheek against his own       

"Love, you will stay?"

"I will not stay!"

And like one who cries out sharply within himself, "Get
thee behind me!" he broke away.

"Adam, come back to me! Come back!"

He looked over his shoulder, saw the fair woman in the
heart of the warm glow, heard her cry of love and longing,
knew the life of luxurious ease that waited for him, but
steadily went out into the night, only answering       

"In a year."




CHAPTER II.

WHIMS.


"Come, Sylvia, it is nine o'clock! Little slug-a-bed, don't[21]
you mean to get up to-day?" said Miss Yule, bustling
into her sister's room with the wide-awake appearance of
one to whom sleep was a necessary evil, to be endured and
gotten over as soon as possible.

"No, why should I?" And Sylvia turned her face away
from the flood of light that poured into the room as Prue
put aside the curtains and flung up the window.

"Why should you? What a question, unless you are
ill; I was afraid you would suffer for that long row yesterday,
and my predictions seldom fail."

"I am not suffering from any cause whatever, and your
prediction does fail this time; I am only tired of everybody
and everything, and see nothing worth getting up for; so I
shall just stay here till I do. Please put the curtain down
and leave me in peace."

Prue had dropped her voice to the foreboding tone so
irritating to nervous persons whether sick or well, and
Sylvia laid her arm across her eyes with an impatient gesture
as she spoke sharply.

"Nothing worth getting up for," cried Prue, like an
aggravating echo. "Why, child, there are a hundred
pleasant things to do if you would only think so. Now[22]
don't be dismal and mope away this lovely day. Get up
and try my plan; have a good breakfast, read the papers,
and then work in your garden before it grows too warm;
that is wholesome exercise and you've neglected it sadly of
late."

"I don't wish any breakfast; I hate newspapers, they are
so full of lies; I'm tired of the garden, for nothing goes
right this year; and I detest taking exercise merely because
it's wholesome. No, I'll not get up for that."

"Then stay in the house and draw, read, or practise.
Sit with Mark in the studio; give Miss Hemming directions
about your summer things, or go into town about your
bonnet. There is a matinée, try that; or make calls, for
you owe fifty at least. Now I'm sure there's employment
enough and amusement enough for any reasonable person."

Prue looked triumphant, but Sylvia was not a "reasonable
person," and went on in her former despondingly
petulant strain.

"I'm tired of drawing; my head is a jumble of other
people's ideas already, and Herr Pedalsturm has put the
piano out of tune. Mark always makes a model of me if
I go to him, and I don't like to see my eyes, arms, or hair
in all his pictures. Miss Hemming's gossip is worse than
fussing over new things that I don't need. Bonnets are my
torment, and matinées are wearisome, for people whisper
and flirt till the music is spoiled. Making calls is the
worst of all; for what pleasure or profit is there in running
from place to place to tell the same polite fibs over and over
again, and listen to scandal that makes you pity or despise
your neighbors. I shall not get up for any of these
things."

Prue leaned on the bedpost meditating with an anxious[23]
face till a forlorn hope appeared which caused her to
exclaim       

"Mark and I are going to see Geoffrey Moor, this morning,
just home from Switzerland, where his poor sister died,
you know. You really ought to come with us and welcome
him, for though you can hardly remember him, he's been
so long away, still, as one of the family, it is a proper compliment
on your part. The drive will do you good, Geoffrey
will be glad to see you, it is a lovely old place, and as
you never saw the inside of the house you cannot complain
that you are tired of that yet."

"Yes I can, for it will never seem as it has done, and I
can no longer go where I please now that a master's presence
spoils its freedom and solitude for me. I don't know
him, and don't care to, though his name is so familiar.
New people always disappoint me, especially if I've heard
them praised ever since I was born. I shall not get up for
any Geoffrey Moor, so that bait fails."

Sylvia smiled involuntarily at her sister's defeat, but
Prue fell back upon her last resource in times like this.
With a determined gesture she plunged her hand into an
abysmal pocket, and from a miscellaneous collection of
treasures selected a tiny vial, presenting it to Sylvia with
a half pleading, half authoritative look and tone.

"I'll leave you in peace if you'll only take a dose of
chamomilla. It is so soothing, that instead of tiring yourself
with all manner of fancies, you'll drop into a quiet
sleep, and by noon be ready to get up like a civilized
being. Do take it, dear; just four sugar-plums, and I'm
satisfied."

Sylvia received the bottle with a docile expression; but
the next minute it flew out of the window, to be shivered[24]
on the walk below, while she said, laughing like a wilful
creature as she was       

"I have taken it in the only way I ever shall, and the
sparrows can try its soothing effects with me; so be satisfied."

"Very well. I shall send for Dr. Baum, for I'm convinced
that you are going to be ill. I shall say no more,
but act as I think proper, because it's like talking to the
wind to reason with you in one of these perverse fits."

As Prue turned away, Sylvia frowned and called after
her       

"Spare yourself the trouble, for Dr. Baum will follow
the chamomilla, if you bring him here. What does he
know about health, a fat German, looking lager beer and
talking sauer-kraut? Bring me bona fide sugar-plums and
I'll take them; but arsenic, mercury, and nightshade are
not to my taste."

"Would you feel insulted if I ask whether your breakfast
is to be sent up, or kept waiting till you choose to come
down?"

Prue looked rigidly calm, but Sylvia knew that she felt
hurt, and with one of the sudden impulses which ruled her
the frown melted to a smile, as drawing her sister down she
kissed her in her most loving manner.

"Dear old soul, I'll be good by-and-by, but now I'm
tired and cross, so let me keep out of every one's way and
drowse myself into a cheerier frame of mind. I want
nothing but solitude, a draught of water, and a kiss."

Prue was mollified at once, and after stirring fussily
about for several minutes gave her sister all she asked, and
departed to the myriad small cares that made her happiness.
As the door closed, Sylvia sighed a long sigh of re[25]lief,
and folding her arms under her head drifted away into
the land of dreams, where ennui is unknown.

All the long summer morning she lay wrapt in sleeping
and waking dreams, forgetful of the world about her, till
her brother played the Wedding March upon her door on
his way to lunch. The desire to avenge the sudden downfall
of a lovely castle in the air roused Sylvia, and sent her
down to skirmish with Mark. Before she could say a word,
however, Prue began to talk in a steady stream, for the
good soul had a habit of jumbling news, gossip, private
opinions and public affairs into a colloquial hodge-podge,
that was often as trying to the intellects as the risibles of
her hearers.

"Sylvia, we had a charming call, and Geoffrey sent his
love to you. I asked him over to dinner, and we shall dine
at six, because then my father can be with us. I shall
have to go to town first, for there are a dozen things suffering
for attention. You can't wear a round hat and lawn
jackets without a particle of set all summer. I want some
things for dinner,       and the carpet must be got. What a
lovely one Geoffrey had in the library! Then I must see
if poor Mrs. Beck has had her leg comfortably off, find out
if Freddy Lennox is dead, and order home the mosquito
nettings. Now don't read all the afternoon, and be ready
to receive any one who may come if I should get belated."

The necessity of disposing of a suspended mouthful produced
a lull, and Sylvia seized the moment to ask in a
careless way, intended to bring her brother out upon his
favorite topic,       

"How did you find your saint, Mark?"

"The same sunshiny soul as ever, though he has had[26]
enough to make him old and grave before his time. He is
just what we need in our neighborhood, and particularly in
our house, for we are a dismal set at times, and he will do
us all a world of good."

"What will become of me, with a pious, prosy, perfect
creature eternally haunting the house and exhorting me on
the error of my ways!" cried Sylvia.

"Don't disturb yourself; he is not likely to take much
notice of you; and it is not for an indolent, freakish midge
to scoff at a man whom she does not know, and couldn't
appreciate if she did," was Mark's lofty reply.

"I rather liked the appearance of the saint, however,"
said Sylvia, with an expression of naughty malice, as she
began her lunch.

"Why, where did you see him!" exclaimed her brother.

"I went over there yesterday to take a farewell run in
the neglected garden before he came. I knew he was expected,
but not that he was here; and when I saw the
house open, I slipped in and peeped wherever I liked. You
are right, Prue; it is a lovely old place."

"Now I know you did something dreadfully unladylike
and improper. Put me out of suspense, I beg of you."

Prue's distressful face and Mark's surprise produced an
inspiring effect upon Sylvia, who continued, with an air of
demure satisfaction       

"I strolled about, enjoying myself, till I got into the
library, and there I rummaged, for it was a charming place,
and I was happy as only those are who love books, and feel
their influence in the silence of a room whose finest ornaments
they are."

"I hope Moor came in and found you trespassing."

"No, I went out and caught him playing. When I'd[27]
stayed as long as I dared, and borrowed a very interesting
old book       

"Sylvia! did you really take one without asking?"
cried Prue, looking almost as much alarmed as if she had
stolen the spoons.

"Yes; why not? I can apologize prettily, and it will
open the way for more. I intend to browse over that library
for the next six months."

"But it was such a liberty,       so rude, so       - dear, dear;
and he as fond and careful of his books as if they were his
children! Well, I wash my hands of it, and am prepared
for anything now!"

Mark enjoyed Sylvia's pranks too much to reprove, so he
only laughed while one sister lamented and the other placidly
went on       

"When I had put the book nicely in my pocket, Prue, I
walked into the garden. But before I'd picked a single
flower, I heard little Tilly laugh behind the hedge and some
strange voice talking to her. So I hopped upon a roller to
see, and nearly tumbled off again; for there was a man lying
on the grass, with the gardener's children rioting over him.
Will was picking his pockets, and Tilly eating strawberries
out of his hat, often thrusting one into the mouth of her long
neighbor, who always smiled when the little hand came
fumbling at his lips. You ought to have seen the pretty
picture, Mark."

"Did he see the interesting picture on your side of the
wall?"

"No, I was just thinking what friendly eyes he had,
listening to his pleasant talk with the little folks, and
watching how they nestled to him as if he were a girl,
when Tilly looked up and cried, 'I see Silver!' So I ran[28]
away, expecting to have them all come racing after. But
no one appeared, and I only heard a laugh instead of the
'stop thief' that I deserved."

"If I had time I should convince you of the impropriety
of such wild actions; as I haven't, I can only implore you
never to do so again on Geoffrey's premises," said Prue,
rising as the carriage drove round.

"I can safely promise that," answered Sylvia, with a
dismal shake of the head, as she leaned listlessly from the
window till her brother and sister were gone.

At the appointed time Moor entered Mr. Yule's hospitably
open door; but no one came to meet him, and the house
was as silent as if nothing human inhabited it. He divined
the cause of this, having met Prue and Mark going downward
some hours before, and saying to himself, "The boat
is late," he disturbed no one, but strolled into the drawing-rooms
and looked about him. Being one of those who seldom
find time heavy on their hands, he amused himself
with observing what changes had been made during his
absence. His journey round the apartments was not a long
one, for, coming to an open window, he paused with an
expression of mingled wonder and amusement.

A pile of cushions, pulled from chair and sofa, lay
before the long window, looking very like a newly deserted
nest. A warm-hued picture lifted from the wall stood in
a streak of sunshine; a half-cleared leaf of fruit lay on a
taboret, and beside it, with a red stain on its title-page,
appeared the stolen book. At sight of this Moor frowned,
caught up his desecrated darling and put it in his pocket.
But as he took another glance at the various indications of
what had evidently been a solitary revel very much after
his own heart, he relented, laid back the book, and, putting[29]
aside the curtain floating in the wind, looked out into the
garden, attracted thither by the sound of a spade.

A lad was at work near by, and wondering what new
inmate the house had gained, the neglected guest waited to
catch a glimpse of the unknown face. A slender boy, in a
foreign-looking blouse of grey linen; a white collar lay
over a ribbon at the throat, stout half boots covered a trim
pair of feet, and a broad-brimmed hat flapped low on the
forehead. Whistling softly he dug with active gestures;
and, having made the necessary cavity, set a shrub, filled
up the hole, trod it down scientifically, and then fell back
to survey the success of his labors. But something was
amiss, something had been forgotten, for suddenly up came
the shrub, and seizing a wheelbarrow that stood near by,
away rattled the boy round the corner out of sight. Moor
smiled at his impetuosity, and awaited his return with interest,
suspecting from appearances that this was some
protégé of Mark's employed as a model as well as gardener's
boy.

Presently up the path came the lad, with head down and
steady pace, trundling a barrow full of richer earth, surmounted
by a watering-pot. Never stopping for breath he
fell to work again, enlarged the hole, flung in the loam,
poured in the water, reset the shrub, and when the last
stamp and pat were given performed a little dance of
triumph about it, at the close of which he pulled off his
hat and began to fan his heated face. The action caused
the observer to start and look again, thinking, as he recognized
the energetic worker with a smile, "What a changeful
thing it is! haunting one's premises unseen, and stealing
one's books unsuspected; dreaming one half the day and
masquerading the other half. What will happen next?[30]
Let us see but not be seen, lest the boy turn shy and run
away before the pretty play is done!"

Holding the curtain between the window and himself,
Moor peeped through the semi-transparent screen, enjoying
the little episode immensely. Sylvia fanned and rested a
few minutes, then went up and down among the flowers,
often pausing to break a dead leaf, to brush away some
harmful insect, or lift some struggling plant into the light;
moving among them as if akin to them, and cognizant of
their sweet wants. If she had seemed strong-armed and
sturdy as a boy before, now she was tender fingered as a
woman, and went humming here and there like any happy-hearted
bee.

"Curious child!" thought Moor, watching the sunshine
glitter on her uncovered head, and listening to the air she
left half sung. "I've a great desire to step out and see
how she will receive me. Not like any other girl, I fancy."

But, before he could execute his design, the roll of a carriage
was heard in the avenue, and pausing an instant, with
head erect like a startled doe, Sylvia turned and vanished,
dropping flowers as she ran. Mr. Yule, accompanied by
his son and daughter, came hurrying in with greetings, explanations,
and apologies, and in a moment the house was
full of a pleasant stir. Steps went up and down, voices
echoed through the rooms, savory odors burst forth from
below, and doors swung in the wind, as if the spell was
broken and the sleeping palace had wakened with a word.

Prue made a hasty toilet and harassed the cook to the
verge of spontaneous combustion, while Mark and his father
devoted themselves to their guest. Just as dinner was announced
Sylvia came in, as calm and cool as if wheelbarrows
[31]were myths and linen suits unknown. Moor was
welcomed with a quiet hand-shake, a grave salutation, and
a look that seemed to say, "Wait a little, I take no friends
on trust."

All through dinner, though she sat as silent as a well-bred
child, she looked and listened with an expression of
keen intelligence that children do not wear, and sometimes
smiled to herself, as if she saw or heard something that
pleased and interested her. When they rose from table she
followed Prue up stairs, quite forgetting the disarray in
which the drawing-room was left. The gentlemen took
possession before either sister returned, and Mark's annoyance
found vent in a philippic against oddities in general
and Sylvia in particular; but his father and friend sat in
the cushionless chairs, and pronounced the scene amusingly
novel. Prue appeared in the midst of the laugh, and having
discovered other delinquencies above, her patience was exhausted,
and her regrets found no check in the presence of
so old a friend as Moor.

"Something must be done about that child, father, for
she is getting entirely beyond my control. If I attempt
to make her study she writes poetry instead of her exercises,
draws caricatures instead of sketching properly, and bewilders
her music teacher by asking questions about Beethoven
and Mendelssohn, as if they were personal friends of
his. If I beg her to take exercise, she rides like an Amazon
all over the Island, grubs in the garden as if for her
living, or goes paddling about the bay till I'm distracted
lest the tide should carry her out to sea. She is so wanting
in moderation she gets ill, and when I give her proper
medicines she flings them out of the window, and threatens
to send that worthy, Dr. Baum, after them. Yet she must
need something to set her right, for she is either overflow[32]ing
with unnatural spirits or melancholy enough to break
one's heart."

"What have you done with the little black sheep of my
flock,       not banished her, I hope?" said Mr. Yule, placidly,
ignoring all complaints.

"She is in the garden, attending to some of her disagreeable
pets, I fancy. If you are going out there to smoke,
please send her in, Mark; I want her."

As Mr. Yule was evidently yearning for his after-dinner
nap, and Mark for his cigar, Moor followed his friend, and
they stepped through the window into the garden, now
lovely with the fading glow of summer sunset.

"You must know that this peculiar little sister of mine
clings to some of her childish beliefs and pleasures in spite
of Prue's preaching and my raillery," began Mark, after a
refreshing whiff or two. "She is overflowing with love
and good will, but being too shy or too proud to offer it to
her fellow-creatures, she expends it upon the necessitous
inhabitants of earth, air, and water with the most charming
philanthropy. Her dependants are neither beautiful nor
very interesting, nor is she sentimentally enamored of
them; but the more ugly and desolate the creature, the
more devoted is she. Look at her now; most young
ladies would have hysterics over any one of those pets
of hers."

Moor looked, and thought the group a very pretty one,
though a plump toad sat at Sylvia's feet, a roly-poly caterpillar
was walking up her sleeve, a blind bird chirped on
her shoulder, bees buzzed harmlessly about her head, as if
they mistook her for a flower, and in her hand a little field
mouse was breathing its short life away. Any tender-hearted
girl might have stood thus surrounded by helpless[33]
things that pity had endeared, but few would have regarded
them with an expression like that which Sylvia wore.
Figure, posture, and employment were so childlike in their
innocent unconsciousness, that the contrast was all the more
strongly marked between them and the sweet thoughtfulness
that made her face singularly attractive with the charm of
dawning womanhood. Moor spoke before Mark could dispose
of his smoke.

"This is a great improvement upon the boudoir full of
lap-dogs, worsted-work and novels, Miss Sylvia. May I
ask if you feel no repugnance to some of your patients;
or is your charity strong enough to beautify them all?"

"I dislike many people, but few animals, because however
ugly I pity them, and whatever I pity I am sure to
love. It may be silly, but I think it does me good; and
till I am wise enough to help my fellow-beings, I try to do
my duty to these humbler sufferers, and find them both
grateful and affectionate."

There was something very winning in the girl's manner
as she spoke, touching the little creature in her hand almost
as tenderly as if it had been a child. It showed the newcomer
another phase of this many-sided character; and
while Sylvia related the histories of her pets at his request,
he was enjoying that finer history which every ingenuous
soul writes on its owner's countenance for gifted eyes to
read and love. As she paused, the little mouse lay stark
and still in her gentle hand; and though they smiled at
themselves, both young men felt like boys again as they
helped her scoop a grave among the pansies, owning the
beauty of compassion, though she showed it to them in
such a simple shape.

Then Mark delivered his message, and Sylvia went away[34]
to receive Prue's lecture, with outward meekness, but such
an absent mind that the words of wisdom went by her like
the wind.

"Now come and take our twilight stroll, while Mark
keeps Mr. Moor in the studio and Prue prepares another
exhortation," said Sylvia, as her father woke, and taking
his arm, they paced along the wide piazza that encircled
the whole house.

"Will father do me a little favor?"

"That is all he lives for, dear."

"Then his life is a very successful one;" and the girl
folded her other hand over that already on his arm. Mr.
Yule shook his head with a regretful sigh, but asked benignly       

"What shall I do for my little daughter?"

"Forbid Mark to execute a plot with which he threatens
me. He says he will bring every gentleman he knows (and
that is a great many) to the house, and make it so agreeable
that they will keep coming; for he insists that I need
amusement, and nothing will be so entertaining as a lover
or two. Please tell him not to, for I don't want any lovers
yet."

"Why not?" asked her father, much amused at her
twilight confidences.

"I'm afraid. Love is so cruel to some people, I feel as
if it would be to me, for I am always in extremes, and continually
going wrong while trying to go right. Love bewilders
the wisest, and it would make me quite blind or
mad, I know; therefore I'd rather have nothing to do with
it, for a long, long while."

"Then Mark shall be forbidden to bring a single specimen.
I very much prefer to keep you as you are. And[35]
yet you may be happier to do as others do; try it, if you
like, my dear."

"But I can't do as others do; I've tried, and failed.
Last winter, when Prue made me go about, though people
probably thought me a stupid little thing, moping in corners,
I was enjoying myself in my own way, and making
discoveries that have been very useful ever since. I know
I'm whimsical, and hard to please, and have no doubt the
fault was in myself, but I was disappointed in nearly every
one I met, though I went into what Prue calls 'our best
society.' The girls seemed all made on the same pattern;
they all said, did, thought, and wore about the same things,
and knowing one was as good as knowing a dozen. Jessie
Hope was the only one I cared much for, and she is so
pretty, she seems made to be looked at and loved."

"How did you find the young gentlemen, Sylvia?"

"Still worse; for, though lively enough among themselves
they never found it worth their while to offer us any
conversation but such as was very like the champagne and
ice-cream they brought us,       sparkling, sweet, and unsubstantial.
Almost all of them wore the superior air they put
on before women, an air that says as plainly as words, 'I
may ask you and I may not.' Now that is very exasperating
to those who care no more for them than so many grasshoppers,
and I often longed to take the conceit out of them
by telling some of the criticisms passed upon them by the
amiable young ladies who looked as if waiting to say meekly,
'Yes, thank you.'"

"Don't excite yourself, my dear; it is all very lamentable
and laughable, but we must submit till the world learns
better. There are often excellent young persons among the
'grasshoppers,' and if you cared to look you might find a[36]
pleasant friend here and there," said Mr. Yule, leaning
a little toward his son's view of the matter.

"No, I cannot even do that without being laughed at;
for no sooner do I mention the word friendship than people
nod wisely and look as if they said, 'Oh, yes, every one
knows what that sort of thing amounts to.' I should like
a friend, father; some one beyond home, because he would
be newer; a man (old or young, I don't care which), because
men go where they like, see things with their own
eyes, and have more to tell if they choose. I want a person
simple, wise, and entertaining; and I think I should make
a very grateful friend if such an one was kind enough to
like me."

"I think you would, and perhaps if you try to be more
like others you will find friends as they do, and so be happy,
Sylvia."

"I cannot be like others, and their friendships would
not satisfy me. I don't try to be odd; I long to be quiet
and satisfied, but I cannot; and when I do what Prue calls
wild things, it is not because I am thoughtless or idle, but
because I am trying to be good and happy. The old ways
fail, so I attempt new ones, hoping they will succeed; but
they don't, and I still go looking and longing for happiness,
yet always failing to find it, till sometimes I think I am a
born disappointment."

"Perhaps love would bring the happiness, my dear?"

"I'm afraid not; but, however that may be, I shall
never go running about for a lover as half my mates do.
When the true one comes I shall know him, love him at
once, and cling to him forever, no matter what may happen.
Till then I want a friend, and I will find one if I can.
Don't you believe there may be real and simple friendships[37]
between men and women without falling into this everlasting
sea of love?"

Mr. Yule was laughing quietly under cover of the darkness,
but composed himself to answer gravely       

"Yes, for some of the most beautiful and famous friendships
have been such, and I see no reason why there may
not be again. Look about, Sylvia, make yourself happy;
and, whether you find friend or lover, remember there is
always the old Papa glad to do his best for you in both
capacities."

Sylvia's hand crept to her father's shoulder, and her voice
was full of daughterly affection, as she said       

"I'll have no lover but 'the old Papa' for a long while
yet. But I will look about, and if I am fortunate enough
to find and good enough to keep the person I want, I shall
be very happy; for, father, I really think I need a friend."

Here Mark called his sister in to sing to them, a demand
that would have been refused but for a promise to Prue to
behave her best as an atonement for past pranks. Stepping
in she sat down and gave Moor another surprise, as from
her slender throat there came a voice whose power and
pathos made a tragedy of the simple ballad she was singing.

"Why did you choose that plaintive thing, all about
love, despair, and death? It quite breaks one's heart to
hear it," said Prue, pausing in a mental estimate of her
morning's shopping.

"It came into my head, and so I sung it. Now I'll try
another, for I am bound to please you       if I can." And
she broke out again with an airy melody as jubilant as if a
lark had mistaken moonlight for the dawn and soared skyward,
singing as it went. So blithe and beautiful were
both voice and song they caused a sigh of pleasure, a sen[38]sation
of keen delight in the listener, and seemed to gift
the singer with an unsuspected charm. As she ended
Sylvia turned about, and seeing the satisfaction of their
guest in his face, prevented him from expressing it in words
by saying, in her frank way       

"Never mind the compliments. I know my voice is
good, for that you may thank nature; that it is well trained,
for that praise Herr Pedalsturm; and that you have heard
it at all, you owe to my desire to atone for certain trespasses
of yesterday and to-day, because I seldom sing before
strangers."

"Allow me to offer my hearty thanks to Nature, Pedalsturm,
and Penitence, and also to hope that in time I may
be regarded, not as a stranger, but a neighbor and a friend."

Something in the gentle emphasis of the last word struck
pleasantly on the girl's ear, and seemed to answer an unspoken
longing. She looked up at him with a searching
glance, appeared to find some 'assurance given by looks,'
and as a smile broke over her face she offered her hand as
if obeying a sudden impulse, and said, half to him, half to
herself       

"I think I have found the friend already."




CHAPTER III.

AFLOAT.


Sylvia sat sewing in the sunshine with an expression on[39]
her face half mirthful, half melancholy, as she looked
backward to the girlhood just ended, and forward to the
womanhood just beginning, for on that midsummer day, she
was eighteen. Voices roused her from her reverie, and, looking
up, she saw her brother approaching with two friends,
their neighbor Geoffrey Moor and his guest Adam Warwick.
Her first impulse was to throw down her work and run to
meet them, her second to remember her new dignity and sit
still, awaiting them with well-bred composure, quite unconscious
that the white figure among the vines added a picturesque
finish to the quiet summer scene.

They came up warm and merry, with a brisk row across
the bay, and Sylvia met them with a countenance that gave
a heartier welcome than her words, as she greeted the
neighbor cordially, the stranger courteously, and began to
gather up her work when they seated themselves in the bamboo
chairs scattered about the wide piazza.

"You need not disturb yourself," said Mark, "we are only
making this a way-station, en route for the studio. Can
you tell me where my knapsack is to be found? after one
of Prue's stowages, nothing short of a divining-rod will
discover it, I'm afraid."[40]

"I know where it is. Are you going away again so soon,
Mark?"

"Only a two days' trip up the river with these mates of
mine. No, Sylvia, it can't be done."

"I did not say anything."

"Not in words, but you looked a whole volley of 'Can't
I goes?' and I answered it. No girl but you would dream
of such a thing; you hate picnics, and as this will be a long
and rough one, don't you see how absurd it would be for
you to try it?"

"I don't quite see it, Mark, for this would not be an ordinary
picnic; it would be like a little romance to me, and
I had rather have it than any birthday present you could
give me. We used to have such happy times together
before we were grown up, I don't like to be so separated now.
But if it is not best, I'm sorry that I even looked a wish."

Sylvia tried to keep both disappointment and desire out
of her voice as she spoke, though a most intense longing had
taken possession of her when she heard of a projected pleasure
so entirely after her own heart. But there was an
unconscious reproach in her last words, a mute appeal in
the wistful eyes that looked across the glittering bay to the
green hills beyond. Now, Mark was both fond and proud of
the young sister, who, while he was studying art abroad,
had studied nature at home, till the wayward but winning
child had bloomed into a most attractive girl. He remembered
her devotion to him, his late neglect of her, and
longed to make atonement. With elevated eyebrows and
inquiring glances, he turned from one friend to another.
Moor nodded and smiled, Warwick nodded, and sighed privately,
and having taken the sense of the meeting by a new
style of vote, Mark suddenly announced[41]       

"You can go if you like, Sylvia."

"What!" cried his sister, starting up with a characteristic
impetuosity that sent her basket tumbling down the
steps, and crowned her dozing cat with Prue's nightcap
frills. "Do you mean it, Mark? Wouldn't it spoil your
pleasure, Mr. Moor? Shouldn't I be a trouble, Mr. Warwick?
Tell me frankly, for if I can go I shall be happier
than I can express."

The gentlemen smiled at her eagerness, but as they saw
the altered face she turned toward them, each felt already
repaid for any loss of freedom they might experience hereafter,
and gave unanimous consent. Upon receipt of which
Sylvia felt inclined to dance about the three and bless them
audibly, but restrained herself, and beamed upon them in
a state of wordless gratitude pleasant to behold. Having
given a rash consent, Mark now thought best to offer a few
obstacles to enhance its value and try his sister's mettle.

"Don't ascend into the air like a young balloon, child,
but hear the conditions upon which you go, for if you fail
to work three miracles it is all over with you. Firstly, the
consent of the higher powers, for father will dread all sorts
of dangers       you are such a freakish creature,       and Prue will
be scandalized because trips like this are not the fashion for
young ladies."

"Consider that point settled and go on to the next," said
Sylvia, who, having ruled the house ever since she was
born, had no fears of success with either father or sister.

"Secondly, you must do yourself up in as compact a
parcel as possible; for though you little women are very
ornamental on land, you are not very convenient for transportation
by water. Cambric gowns and French slippers
are highly appropriate and agreeable at the present moment,[42]
but must be sacrificed to the stern necessities of the case.
You must make a dowdy of yourself in some usefully short,
scant, dingy costume, which will try the nerves of all
beholders, and triumphantly prove that women were never
meant for such excursions."

"Wait five minutes and I'll triumphantly prove to the
contrary," answered Sylvia, as she ran into the house.

Her five minutes was sufficiently elastic to cover fifteen,
for she was ravaging her wardrobe to effect her purpose
and convince her brother, whose artistic tastes she consulted,
with a skill that did her good service in the end.
Rapidly assuming a gray gown, with a jaunty jacket of the
same, she kilted the skirt over one of green, the pedestrian
length of which displayed boots of uncompromising thickness.
Over her shoulder, by a broad ribbon, she slung a
prettily wrought pouch, and ornamented her hat pilgrim-wise
with a cockle shell. Then taking her brother's alpen-stock
she crept down, and standing in the door-way presented
a little figure all in gray and green, like the earth
she was going to wander over, and a face that blushed and
smiled and shone as she asked demurely       

"Please, Mark, am I picturesque and convenient enough
to go?"

He wheeled about and stared approvingly, forgetting
cause in effect till Warwick began to laugh like a merry
bass viol, and Moor joined him, saying       

"Come, Mark, own that you are conquered, and let us
turn our commonplace voyage into a pleasure pilgrimage,
with a lively lady to keep us knights and gentlemen
wherever we are."

"I say no more; only remember, Sylvia, if you get
burnt, drowned, or blown away, I'm not responsible for the[43]
damage, and shall have the satisfaction of saying, 'There,
I told you so.'"

"That satisfaction may be mine when I come home quite
safe and well," replied Sylvia, serenely. "Now for the last
condition."

Warwick looked with interest from the sister to the
brother; for, being a solitary man, domestic scenes and
relations possessed the charm of novelty to him.

"Thirdly, you are not to carry a boat-load of luggage,
cloaks, pillows, silver forks, or a dozen napkins, but are to
fare as we fare, sleeping in hammocks, barns, or on the
bare ground, without shrieking at bats or bewailing the
want of mosquito netting; eating when, where, and what is
most convenient, and facing all kinds of weather regardless
of complexion, dishevelment, and fatigue. If you can
promise all this, be here loaded and ready to go off at six
o'clock to-morrow morning."

After which cheerful picture of the joys to come, Mark
marched away to his studio, taking his friends with him.

Sylvia worked the three miracles, and at half past five,
A. M. was discovered sitting on the piazza, with her hammock
rolled into a twine sausage at her feet, her hat firmly
tied on, her scrip packed, and her staff in her hand.
"Waiting till called for," she said, as her brother passed
her, late and yawning as usual. As the clock struck six
the carriage drove round, and Moor and Warwick came up
the avenue in nautical array. Then arose a delightful
clamor of voices, slamming of doors, hurrying of feet and
frequent peals of laughter; for every one was in holiday
spirits, and the morning seemed made for pleasuring.

Mr. Yule regarded the voyagers with an aspect as benign
as the summer sky overhead; Prue ran to and fro pouring[44]
forth a stream of counsels, warnings, and predictions; men
and maids gathered on the lawn or hung out of upper windows;
and even old Hecate, the cat, was seen chasing imaginary
rats and mice in the grass till her yellow eyes
glared with excitement. "All in," was announced at last,
and as the carriage rolled away its occupants looked at one
another with faces of blithe satisfaction that their pilgrimage
was so auspiciously begun.

A mile or more up the river the large, newly-painted
boat awaited them. The embarkation was a speedy one,
for the cargo was soon stowed in lockers and under seats,
Sylvia forwarded to her place in the bow; Mark, as commander
of the craft, took the helm; Moor and Warwick,
as crew, sat waiting orders; and Hugh, the coachman,
stood ready to push off at word of command. Presently it
came, a strong hand sent them rustling through the flags,
down dropped the uplifted oars, and with a farewell cheer
from a group upon the shore the Kelpie glided out into the
stream.

Sylvia, too full of genuine content to talk, sat listening
to the musical dip of well-pulled oars, watching the green
banks on either side, dabbling her hands in the eddies as
they rippled by, and singing to the wind, as cheerful and
serene as the river that gave her back a smiling image of
herself. What her companions talked of she neither heard
nor cared to know, for she was looking at the great picture-book
that always lies ready for the turning of the youngest
or the oldest hands; was receiving the welcome of the playmates
she best loved, and was silently yielding herself to
the power which works all wonders with its benignant
magic. Hour after hour she journeyed along that fluent
road. Under bridges where early fishers lifted up their[45]
lines to let them through; past gardens tilled by unskilful
townsmen who harvested an hour of strength to pay the
daily tax the city levied on them; past honeymoon cottages
where young wives walked with young husbands in the
dew, or great houses shut against the morning. Lovers
came floating down the stream with masterless rudder and
trailing oars. College race-boats shot by with modern
Greek choruses in full blast and the frankest criticisms from
their scientific crews. Fathers went rowing to and fro with
argosies of pretty children, who gave them gay good morrows.
Sometimes they met fanciful nutshells manned by
merry girls, who made for shore at sight of them with most
erratic movements and novel commands included in their
Art of Navigation. Now and then some poet or philosopher
went musing by, fishing for facts or fictions, where
other men catch pickerel or perch.

All manner of sights and sounds greeted Sylvia, and she
felt as if she were watching a Panorama painted in water
colors by an artist who had breathed into his work the
breath of life and given each figure power to play its part.
Never had human faces looked so lovely to her eye, for
morning beautified the plainest with its ruddy kiss; never
had human voices sounded so musical to her ear, for daily
cares had not yet brought discord to the instruments tuned
by sleep and touched by sunshine into pleasant sound;
never had the whole race seemed so near and dear to her,
for she was unconsciously pledging all she met in that
genuine Elixir Vitæ which sets the coldest blood aglow
and makes the whole world kin; never had she felt so
truly her happiest self, for of all the costlier pleasures she
had known not one had been so congenial as this, as she
rippled farther and farther up the stream and seemed to[46]
float into a world whose airs brought only health and peace.
Her comrades wisely left her to her thoughts, a smiling
Silence for their figure-head, and none among them but
found the day fairer and felt himself fitter to enjoy it for
the innocent companionship of maidenhood and a happy
heart.

At noon they dropped anchor under a wide-spreading
oak that stood on the river's edge, a green tent for wanderers
like themselves; there they ate their first meal spread
among white clovers, with a pair of squirrels staring at
them as curiously as human spectators ever watched royalty
at dinner, while several meek cows courteously left their
guests the shade and went away to dine at a side-table
spread in the sun. They spent an hour or two talking or
drowsing luxuriously on the grass; then the springing up
of a fresh breeze roused them all, and weighing anchor they
set sail for another port.

Now Sylvia saw new pictures, for, leaving all traces of the
city behind them, they went swiftly countryward. Sometimes
by hayfields, each an idyl in itself, with white-sleeved
mowers all arow; the pleasant sound of whetted scythes;
great loads rumbling up lanes, with brown-faced children
shouting atop; rosy girls raising fragrant winrows or bringing
water for thirsty sweethearts leaning on their rakes. Often
they saw ancient farm-houses with mossy roofs, and long
well-sweeps suggestive of fresh draughts, and the drip of
brimming pitchers; orchards and cornfields rustling on either
hand, and grandmotherly caps at the narrow windows, or stout
matrons tending babies in the doorway as they watched
smaller selves playing keep house under the "laylocks"
by the wall. Villages, like white flocks, slept on the hillsides;
martinbox schoolhouses appeared here and there,[47]
astir with busy voices, alive with wistful eyes; and more
than once they came upon little mermen bathing, who dived
with sudden splashes, like a squad of turtles tumbling off a
sunny rock.

Then they went floating under vernal arches, where
a murmurous rustle seemed to whisper, "Stay!" along
shadowless sweeps, where the blue turned to gold and dazzled
with its unsteady shimmer; passed islands so full of
birds they seemed green cages floating in the sun, or doubled
capes that opened long vistas of light and shade, through
which they sailed into the pleasant land where summer
reigned supreme. To Sylvia it seemed as if the inhabitants
of these solitudes had flocked down to the shore to greet
her as she came. Fleets of lilies unfurled their sails on
either hand, and cardinal flowers waved their scarlet flags
among the green. The sagittaria lifted its blue spears from
arrowy leaves; wild roses smiled at her with blooming
faces; meadow lilies rang their flame-colored bells; and
clematis and ivy hung garlands everywhere, as if hers were
a floral progress, and each came to do her honor.

Her neighbors kept up a flow of conversation as steady
as the river's, and Sylvia listened now. Insensibly the
changeful scenes before them recalled others, and in the
friendly atmosphere that surrounded them these reminiscences
found free expression. Each of the three had been
fortunate in seeing much of foreign life; each had seen a
different phase of it, and all were young enough to be still
enthusiastic, accomplished enough to serve up their recollections
with taste and skill, and give Sylvia glimpses of the
world through spectacles sufficiently rose-colored to lend it
the warmth which even Truth allows to her sister Romance.

The wind served them till sunset, then the sail was low[48]ered
and the rowers took to their oars. Sylvia demanded
her turn, and wrestled with one big oar while Warwick sat
behind and did the work. Having blistered her hands and
given herself as fine a color as any on her brother's palette,
she professed herself satisfied, and went back to her seat
to watch the evening-red transfigure earth and sky, making
the river and its banks a more royal pageant than
splendor-loving Elizabeth ever saw along the Thames.

Anxious to reach a certain point, they rowed on into the
twilight, growing stiller and stiller as the deepening hush
seemed to hint that Nature was at her prayers. Slowly the
Kelpie floated along the shadowy way, and as the shores
grew dim, the river dark with leaning hemlocks or an overhanging
cliff, Sylvia felt as if she were making the last
voyage across that fathomless stream where a pale boatman
plies and many go lamenting.

The long silence was broken first by Moor's voice, saying       

"Adam, sing."

If the influences of the hour had calmed Mark, touched
Sylvia, and made Moor long for music, they had also softened
Warwick. Leaning on his oar he lent the music of a
mellow voice to the words of a German Volkslied, and
launched a fleet of echoes such as any tuneful vintager
might have sent floating down the Rhine. Sylvia was no
weeper, but as she listened, all the day's happiness which
had been pent up in her heart found vent in sudden tears,
that streamed down noiseless and refreshing as a warm
south rain. Why they came she could not tell, for neither
song nor singer possessed the power to win so rare a
tribute, and at another time, she would have restrained all
visible expression of this indefinable yet sweet emotion.
Mark and Moor had joined in the burden of the song, and[49]
when that was done took up another; but Sylvia only
sat and let her tears flow while they would, singing at
heart, though her eyes were full and her cheeks wet faster
than the wind could kiss them dry.

After frequent peerings and tackings here and there,
Mark at last discovered the haven he desired, and with
much rattling of oars, clanking of chains, and splashing
of impetuous boots, a landing was effected, and Sylvia
found herself standing on a green bank with her hammock
in her arms and much wonderment in her mind whether the
nocturnal experiences in store for her would prove as agreeable
as the daylight ones had been. Mark and Moor unloaded
the boat and prospected for an eligible sleeping-place.
Warwick, being an old campaigner, set about building a
fire, and the girl began her sylvan housekeeping. The
scene rapidly brightened into light and color as the blaze
sprang up, showing the little kettle slung gipsywise on
forked sticks, and the supper prettily set forth in a leafy
table-service on a smooth, flat stone. Soon four pairs of
wet feet surrounded the fire; an agreeable oblivion of meum
and tuum concerning plates, knives, and cups did away with
etiquette, and every one was in a comfortable state of weariness,
which rendered the thought of bed so pleasant that
they deferred their enjoyment of the reality, as children
keep the best bite till the last.

"What are you thinking of here all by yourself?" asked
Mark, coming to lounge on his sister's plaid, which she had
spread somewhat apart from the others, and where she sat
watching the group before her with a dreamy aspect.

"I was watching your two friends. See what a fine study
they make with the red flicker of the fire on their faces and
the background of dark pines behind them."[50]

They did make a fine study, for both were goodly men
yet utterly unlike, one being of the heroic type, the other
of the poetic. Warwick was a head taller than his tall
friend, broad-shouldered, strong-limbed, and bronzed by
wind and weather. A massive head, covered with rings of
ruddy brown hair, gray eyes, that seemed to pierce through
all disguises, an eminent nose, and a beard like one of
Mark's stout saints. Power, intellect, and courage were
stamped on face and figure, making him the manliest man
that Sylvia had ever seen. He leaned against the stone,
yet nothing could have been less reposeful than his attitude,
for the native unrest of the man asserted itself in spite of
weariness or any soothing influence of time or place. Moor
was much slighter, and betrayed in every gesture the unconscious
grace of the gentleman born. A most attractive
face, with its broad brow, serene eyes, and the cordial smile
about the mouth. A sweet, strong nature, one would say,
which, having used life well had learned the secret of a
true success. Inward tranquillity seemed his, and it was
plain to see that no wave of sound, no wandering breath,
no glimpse of color, no hint of night or nature was without
its charm and its significance for him.

"Tell me about that man, Mark. I have heard you speak
of him since you came home, but supposing he was some
blowzy artist, I never cared to ask about him. Now I've
seen him, I want to know more," said Sylvia, as her brother
laid himself down after an approving glance at the group
opposite.

"I met him in Munich, when I first went abroad, and
since then we have often come upon each other in our wanderings.
He never writes, but goes and comes intent upon
his own affairs; yet one never can forget him, and is always[51]
glad to feel the grip of his hand again, it seems to put such
life and courage into one."

"Is he good?" asked Sylvia, womanlike, beginning with
the morals.

"Violently virtuous. He is a masterful soul, bent on
living out his beliefs and aspirations at any cost. Much
given to denunciation of wrong-doing everywhere, and eager
to execute justice upon all offenders high or low. Yet he
possesses great nobility of character, great audacity of mind,
and leads a life of the sternest integrity."

"Is he rich?"

"In his own eyes, because he makes his wants so few."

"Is he married?"

"No; he has no family, and not many friends, for he
says what he means in the bluntest English, and few stand
the test his sincerity applies."

"What does he do in the world?"

"Studies it, as we do books; dives into everything, analyzes
character, and builds up his own with materials which
will last. If that's not genius it's something better."

"Then he will do much good and be famous, won't he?"

"Great good to many, but never will be famous, I fear.
He is too fierce an iconoclast to suit the old party, too individual
a reformer to join the new, and being born a century
too soon must bide his time, or play out his part before stage
and audience are ready for him."

"Is he learned?"

"Very, in uncommon sorts of wisdom; left college after
a year of it, because it could not give him what he wanted,
and taking the world for his university, life for his tutor,
says he shall not graduate till his term ends with days."

"I know I shall like him very much."[52]

"I hope so, for my sake. He is a grand man in the rough,
and an excellent tonic for those who have courage to try
him."

Sylvia was silent, thinking over all she had just heard
and finding much to interest her in it, because, to her imaginative
and enthusiastic nature, there was something
irresistibly attractive in the strong, solitary, self-reliant
man. Mark watched her for a moment, then asked with
lazy curiosity       

"How do you like this other friend of mine?"

"He went away when I was such a child that since he
came back I've had to begin again; but if I like him at the
end of another month as much as I do now, I shall try to
make your friend my friend, because I need such an one
very much."

Mark laughed at the innocent frankness of his sister's
speech but took it as she meant it, and answered soberly       

"Better leave Platonics till you're forty. Though Moor
is twelve years older than yourself he is a young man still,
and you are grown a very captivating little woman."

Sylvia looked both scornful and indignant.

"You need have no fears. There is such a thing as
true and simple friendship between men and women, and
if I can find no one of my own sex who can give me the help
and happiness I want, why may I not look for it anywhere
and accept it in whatever shape it comes?"

"You may, my dear, and I'll lend a hand with all my
heart, but you must be willing to take the consequences in
whatever shape they come," said Mark, not ill pleased with
the prospect his fancy conjured up.

"I will," replied Sylvia loftily, and fate took her at her
word.[53]

Presently some one suggested bed, and the proposition
was unanimously accepted.

"Where are you going to hang me?" asked Sylvia, as
she laid hold of her hammock and looked about her with
nearly as much interest as if her suspension was to be of
the perpendicular order.

"You are not to be swung up in a tree to-night but laid
like a ghost, and requested not to walk till morning. There
is an unused barn close by, so we shall have a roof over us
for one night longer," answered Mark, playing chamberlain
while the others remained to quench the fire and secure the
larder.

An early moon lighted Sylvia to bed, and when shown
her half the barn, which, as she was a Marine, was very
properly the bay, Mark explained, she scouted the idea of
being nervous or timid in such rude quarters, made herself
a cosy nest and bade her brother a merry good night.

More weary than she would confess, Sylvia fell asleep at
once, despite the novelty of her situation and the noises
that fill a summer night with fitful rustlings and tones.
How long she slept she did not know, but woke suddenly and
sat erect with that curious thrill which sometimes
startles one out of deepest slumber, and is often the forerunner
of some dread or danger. She felt this hot tingle
through blood and nerves, and stared about her thinking of
fire. But everything was dark and still, and after waiting
a few moments she decided that her nest had been too warm,
for her temples throbbed and her cheeks were feverish with
the close air of the barn half filled with new-made hay.

Creeping up a fragrant slope she spread her plaid again
and lay down where a cool breath flowed through wide
chinks in the wall. Sleep was slowly returning when the[54]
rustle of footsteps scared it quite away and set her heart
beating fast, for they came toward the new couch she had
chosen. Holding her breath she listened. The quiet tread
drew nearer and nearer till it paused within a yard of her,
then some one seemed to throw themselves down, sigh heavily
a few times and grow still as if falling asleep.

"It is Mark," thought Sylvia, and whispered his name, but
no one answered, and from the other corner of the barn she
heard her brother muttering in his sleep. Who was it,
then? Mark had said there were no cattle near, she was
sure neither of her comrades had left their bivouac, for
there was her brother talking as usual in his dreams; some
one seemed restless and turned often with decided motion,
that was Warwick, she thought, while the quietest sleeper
of the three betrayed his presence by laughing once with
the low-toned merriment she recognized as Moor's. These
discoveries left her a prey to visions of grimy strollers,
maudlin farm-servants, and infectious emigrants in dismal
array. A strong desire to cry out possessed her for a moment,
but was checked; for with all her sensitiveness Sylvia
had much common sense, and that spirit which hates to be
conquered even by a natural fear. She remembered her
scornful repudiation of the charge of timidity, and the
endless jokes she would have to undergo if her mysterious
neighbor should prove some harmless wanderer or an imaginary
terror of her own, so she held her peace, thinking
valiantly as the drops gathered on her forehead, and every
sense grew painfully alert       

"I'll not call if my hair turns gray with fright, and I
find myself an idiot to-morrow. I told them to try me, and
I won't be found wanting at the first alarm. I'll be still,
if the thing does not touch me till dawn, when I shall[55]
know how to act at once, and so save myself from ridicule
at the cost of a wakeful night."

Holding fast to this resolve Sylvia lay motionless; listening
to the cricket's chirp without, and taking uncomfortable
notes of the state of things within, for the new comer stirred
heavily, sighed long and deeply, and seemed to wake often,
like one too sad or weary to rest. She would have been wise
to have screamed her scream and had the rout over, for she
tormented herself with the ingenuity of a lively fancy, and
suffered more from her own terrors than at the discovery of
a dozen vampires. Every tale of diablerie she had ever
heard came most inopportunely to haunt her now, and
though she felt their folly she could not free herself from
their dominion. She wondered till she could wonder no
longer what the morning would show her. She tried to
calculate in how many springs she could reach and fly over
the low partition which separated her from her sleeping
body-guard. She wished with all her heart that she had
stayed in her nest which was nearer the door, and watched
for dawn with eyes that ached to see the light.

In the midst of these distressful sensations the far-off crow
of some vigilant chanticleer assured her that the short summer
night was wearing away and relief was at hand. This
comfortable conviction had so good an effect that she lapsed
into what seemed a moment's oblivion, but was in fact an
hour's restless sleep, for when her eyes unclosed again the
first red streaks were visible in the east, and a dim light
found its way into the barn through the great door which
had been left ajar for air. An instant Sylvia lay collecting
herself, then rose on her arm, looked resolutely behind her,
stared with round eyes a moment, and dropped down again,
laughing with a merriment, which coming on the heels of[56]
her long alarm was rather hysterical. All she saw was a
little soft-eyed Alderney, which lifted its stag-like head, and
regarded her with a confiding aspect that won her pardon
for its innocent offence.

Through the relief of both mind and body which she
experienced in no small degree, the first thought that came
was a thankful "what a mercy I didn't call Mark, for I
should never have heard the last of this;" and having
fought her fears alone she enjoyed her success alone, and
girl-like resolved to say nothing of her first night's adventures.
Gathering herself up she crept nearer and caressed
her late terror, which stretched its neck toward her with a
comfortable sound, and munched her shawl like a cosset
lamb. But before this new friendship was many minutes
old, Sylvia's heavy lids fell together, her head dropped
lower and lower, her hand lay still on the dappled neck,
and with a long sigh of weariness she dropped back upon
the hay, leaving little Alderney to watch over her much
more tranquilly than she had watched over it.




CHAPTER IV.

THROUGH FLOOD AND FIELD AND FIRE.


Very early were they afloat again, and as they glided[57]
up the stream Sylvia watched the earth's awakening, seeing
in it what her own should be. The sun was not yet visible
above the hills, but the sky was ready for his coming, with
the soft flush of color dawn gives only to her royal lover.
Birds were chanting matins as if all the jubilance of their
short lives must be poured out at once. Flowers stirred
and brightened like children after sleep. A balmy wind
came whispering from the wood, bringing the aroma of
pines, the cool breath of damp nooks, the healthful kiss
that leaves a glow behind. Light mists floated down the
river like departing visions that had haunted it by night,
and every ripple breaking on the shore seemed to sing a
musical good morrow.

Sylvia could not conceal the weariness her long vigil left
behind; and after betraying herself by a drowsy lurch that
nearly took her overboard, she made herself comfortable,
and slept till the grating of the keel on a pebbly shore woke
her to find a new harbor reached under the lee of a cliff,
whose deep shadow was very grateful after the glare of
noon upon the water.

"How do you intend to dispose of yourself this after[58]noon,
Adam?" asked Mark, when dinner was over and his
sister busy feeding the birds.

"In this way," answered Warwick, producing a book
and settling himself in a commodious cranny of the rock.

"Moor and I want to climb the cliff and sketch the
view; but it is too rough a road for Sylvia. Would you
mind mounting guard for an hour or two? Read away, and
leave her to amuse herself; only pray don't let her get into
any mischief by way of enjoying her liberty, for she fears
nothing and is fond of experiments."

"I'll do my best," replied Warwick, with an air of resignation.

Having slung the hammock and seen Sylvia safely into
it, the climbers departed, leaving her to enjoy the luxury
of motion. For half an hour she swung idly, looking up
into the green pavilion overhead, where many insect families
were busy with their small joys and cares, or out over
the still landscape basking in the warmth of a cloudless
afternoon. Then she opened a book Mark had brought for
his own amusement, and began to read as intently as her
companion, who leaned against the boulder slowly turning
his pages, with leafy shadows flickering over his uncovered
head and touching it with alternate sun and shade. The
book proved interesting, and Sylvia was rapidly skimming
into the heart of the story, when an unguarded motion
caused her swing to slope perilously to one side, and in
saving herself she lost her book. This produced a predicament,
for being helped into a hammock and getting out
alone are two very different things. She eyed the distance
from her nest to the ground, and fancied it had been made
unusually great to keep her stationary. She held fast with
one hand and stretched downward with the other, but the[59]
book insolently flirted its leaves just out of reach. She
took a survey of Warwick; he had not perceived her plight,
and she felt an unwonted reluctance to call for help, because
he did not look like one used to come and go at a
woman's bidding. After several fruitless essays she decided
to hazard an ungraceful descent; and, gathering herself up,
was about to launch boldly out, when Warwick cried,
"Stop!" in a tone that nearly produced the catastrophe
he wished to avert. Sylvia subsided, and coming up he
lifted the book, glanced at the title, then keenly at the
reader.

"Do you like this?"

"So far very much."

"Are you allowed to read what you choose?"

"Yes, sir. That is Mark's choice, however; I brought
no book."

"I advise you to skim it into the river; it is not a book
for you."

Sylvia caught a glimpse of the one he had been reading
himself, and impelled by a sudden impulse to see what
would come of it, she answered with a look as keen as his
own       

"You disapprove of my book; would you recommend
yours?"

"In this case, yes; for in one you will find much falsehood
in purple and fine linen, in the other some truth in fig-leaves.
Take your choice."

He offered both; but Sylvia took refuge in civility.

"I thank you, I'll have neither; but if you will please
steady the hammock, I will try to find some more harmless
amusement for myself."

He obeyed with one of the humorous expressions which[60]
often passed over his face. Sylvia descended as gracefully
as circumstances permitted, and went roving up and down
the cliffs. Warwick resumed his seat and the "barbaric
yawp," but seemed to find Truth in demi-toilet less interesting
than Youth in a gray gown and round hat, for which
his taste is to be commended. The girl had small scope
for amusement, and when she had gathered moss for pillows,
laid out a white fungus to dry for a future pin-cushion,
harvested penny-royal in little sheaves tied with
grass-blades, watched a battle between black ants and red,
and learned the landscape by heart; she was at the end of
her resources, and leaning on a stone surveyed earth and
sky with a somewhat despondent air.

"You would like something to do, I think."

"Yes, sir; for being rather new to this sort of life, I
have not yet learned how to dispose of my time."

"I see that, and having deprived you of one employment
will try to replace it by another."

Warwick rose, and going to the single birch that glimmered
among the pines like a delicate spirit of the wood,
he presently returned with strips of silvery bark.

"You were wishing for baskets to hold your spoils, yesterday;
shall we make some now?" he asked.

"How stupid in me not to think of that! Yes, thank
you, I should like it very much;" and producing her housewife,
Sylvia fell to work with a brightening face.

Warwick sat a little below her on the rock, shaping his
basket in perfect silence. This did not suit Sylvia, for feeling
lively and loquacious she wanted conversation to occupy
her thoughts as pleasantly as the birch rolls were occupying
her hands, and there sat a person who, she was sure, could
do it perfectly if he chose. She reconnoitered with covert[61]
glances, made sundry overtures, and sent out envoys in the
shape of scissors, needles, and thread. But no answering
glance met hers; her remarks received the briefest replies,
and her offers of assistance were declined with an absent
"No, thank you." Then she grew indignant at this seeming
neglect, and thought, as she sat frowning over her work,
behind his back       

"He treats me like a child,       very well, then, I'll
behave like one, and beset him with questions till he is
driven to speak; for he can talk, he ought to talk, he shall
talk."

"Mr. Warwick, do you like children?" she began, with
a determined aspect.

"Better than men or women."

"Do you enjoy amusing them?"

"Exceedingly, when in the humor."

"Are you in the humor now?"

"Yes, I think so."

"Then why don't you amuse me?"

"Because you are not a child."

"I fancied you thought me one."

"If I had, I probably should have put you on my knee,
and told you fairy tales, or cut dolls for you out of this
bark, instead of sitting respectfully silent and making a
basket for your stores."

There was a curious smile about Warwick's mouth as he
spoke, and Sylvia was rather abashed by her first exploit.
But there was a pleasure in the daring, and choosing another
topic she tried again.

"Mark was telling me last night about the great college
you had chosen; I thought it must be a very original and
interesting way to educate one's self, and wanted very much[62]
to know what you had been studying lately. May I ask
you now?"

"Men and women," was the brief answer.

"Have you got your lesson, sir?"

"A part of it very thoroughly, I believe."

"Would you think me rude if I asked which part?"

"The latter."

"And what conclusions do you arrive at concerning this
branch of the subject?" asked Sylvia, smiling and interested.

"That it is both dangerous and unsatisfactory."

He spoke so gravely, looked so stern, that Sylvia obeyed
a warning instinct and sat silent till she had completed a
canoe-shaped basket, the useful size of which produced
a sudden longing to fill it. Her eye had already spied a
knoll across the river covered with vines, and so suggestive
of berries that she now found it impossible to resist the desire
for an exploring trip in that direction. The boat was
too large for her to manage alone, but an enterprising spirit
had taken possession of her, and having made one voyage
of discovery with small success she resolved to try again,
hoping a second in another direction might prove more
fruitful.

"Is your basket done, sir?" she asked.

"Yes; will you have it?"

"Why, you have made it as an Indian would, using
grass instead of thread. It is much more complete than
mine, for the green stitches ornament the white bark, but
the black ones disfigure it. I should know a man made
your basket and a woman mine."

"Because one is ugly and strong, the other graceful but
unable to stand alone?" asked Warwick, rising, with a[63]
gesture that sent the silvery shreds flying away on the
wind.

"One holds as much as the other, however; and I fancy
the woman would fill hers soonest if she had the wherewithal
to do it. Do you know there are berries on that
hillside opposite?"

"I see vines, but consider fruit doubtful, for boys and
birds are thicker than blackberries."

"I've a firm conviction that they have left some for us;
and as Mark says you like frankness, I think I shall venture
to ask you to row me over and help me fill the baskets on
the other side."

Sylvia looked up at him with a merry mixture of doubt
and daring in her face, and offered him his hat.

"Very good, I will," said Warwick, leading the way to
the boat with an alacrity which proved how much pleasanter
to him was action than repose.

There was no dry landing-place just opposite, and as he
rowed higher, Adam fixed his eyes on Sylvia with a look
peculiar to himself, a gaze more keen than soft, which
seemed to search one through and through with its rapid
discernment. He saw a face full of contradictions,       youthful,
maidenly, and intelligent, yet touched with the unconscious
melancholy which is born of disappointment and
desire. The mouth was sweet and tender as a woman's
should be, the brow spirited and thoughtful; but the eyes
were by turns eager, absent, or sad, and there was much
pride in the carriage of the small head with its hair of wavy
gold gathered into a green snood, whence little tendrils kept
breaking loose to dance upon her forehead, or hang about
her neck. A most significant but not a beautiful face, because
of its want of harmony. The dark eyes, among their[64]
fair surroundings, disturbed the sight as a discord in music
jars upon the ear; even when the lips smiled the sombre
shadow of black lashes seemed to fill them with a gloom
that was never wholly lost. The voice, too, which should
have been a girlish treble, was full and low as a matured
woman's, with now and then a silvery ring to it, as if another
and a blither creature spoke.

Sylvia could not be offended by the grave penetration of
this glance, though an uncomfortable consciousness that
she was being analyzed and tested made her meet it with
a look intended to be dignified, but which was also somewhat
defiant, and more than one smile passed over Warwick's
countenance as he watched her. The moment the
boat glided with a soft swish among the rushes that
fringed the shore, she sprang up the bank, and leaving a
basket behind her by way of hint, hurried to the sandy
knoll, where, to her great satisfaction, she found the vines
heavy with berries. As Warwick joined her she held up
a shining cluster, saying with a touch of exultation in her
voice       

"My faith is rewarded; taste and believe."

He accepted them with a nod, and said pleasantly       

"As my prophecy has failed, let us see if yours will be
fulfilled."

"I accept the challenge." And down upon her knees
went Sylvia among the vines, regardless of stains, rents, or
wounded hands.

Warwick strolled away to leave her "claim" free, and
silence fell between them; for one was too busy with
thorns, the other with thoughts, to break the summer stillness.
Sylvia worked with as much energy as if a silver
cup was to be the reward of success. The sun shone fer[65]vently
and the wind was cut off by the hill, drops gathered
on her forehead and her cheeks glowed; but she only
pushed off her hat, thrust back her hair, and moved on to a
richer spot. Vines caught at her by sleeve and skirt as if
to dishearten the determined plunderer, but on she went
with a wrench and a rip, an impatient "Ah!" and a hasty
glance at damaged fabrics and fingers. Lively crickets
flew up in swarms about her, surly wasps disputed her
right to the fruit, and drunken bees blundered against
her as they met zigzagging homeward much the worse for
blackberry wine. She never heeded any of them, though
at another time she would gladly have made friends with
all, but found compensation for her discomforts in the busy
twitter of sand swallows perched on the mullein-tops, the
soft flight of yellow butterflies, and the rapidity with which
the little canoe received its freight of "Ethiop sweets." As
the last handful went in she sprung up crying "Done!"
with a suddenness that broke up the Long Parliament and
sent its members skimming away as if a second "Noll"
had appeared among them. "Done!" came back Warwick's
answer like a deep echo from below, and hurrying
down to meet him she displayed her success, saying
archly       

"I am glad we both won, though to be perfectly candid
I think mine is decidedly the fullest." But as she swung up
her birch pannier the handle broke, and down went basket,
berries and all, into the long grass rustling at her feet.

Warwick could not restrain a laugh at the blank dismay
that fell upon the exultation of Sylvia's face, and for a
moment she was both piqued and petulant. Hot, tired,
disappointed, and, hardest of all, laughed at, it was one of
those times that try girls' souls. But she was too old to[66]
cry, too proud to complain, too well-bred to resent, so the
little gust passed over unseen, she thought, and joining in
the merriment she said, as she knelt down beside the
wreck       

"This is a practical illustration of the old proverb, and
I deserve it for my boasting. Next time I'll try to combine
strength and beauty in my work."

To wise people character is betrayed by trifles. Warwick
stopped laughing, and something about the girlish
figure in the grass, regathering with wounded hands the
little harvest lately lost, seemed to touch him. His face
softened suddenly as he collected several broad leaves,
spread them on the grass, and sitting down by Sylvia,
looked under her hat-brim with a glance of mingled penitence
and friendliness.

"Now, young philosopher, pile up your berries in that
green platter while I repair the basket. Bear this in mind
when you work in bark: make your handle the way of the
grain, and choose a strip both smooth and broad."

Then drawing out his knife he fell to work, and while
he tied green withes, as if the task were father to the
thought, he told her something of a sojourn among the
Indians, of whom he had learned much concerning their
woodcraft, arts, and superstitions; lengthening the legend
till the little canoe was ready for another launch. With
her fancy full of war-trails and wampum, Sylvia followed
to the river-side, and as they floated back dabbled her
stained fingers in the water, comforting their smart with
its cool flow till they swept by the landing-place, when she
asked, wonderingly       

"Where are we going now? Have I been so troublesome
that I must be taken home?"[67]

"We are going to get a third course to follow the berries,
unless you are afraid to trust yourself to me."

"Indeed, I'm not; take me where you like, sir."

Something in her frank tone, her confiding look, seemed
to please Warwick; he sat a moment looking into the
brown depths of the water, and let the boat drift, with no
sound but the musical drip of drops from the oars.

"You are going upon a rock, sir."

"I did that three months ago."

He spoke as if to himself, his face darkened, and he
shook the hair off his forehead with an impatient gesture.
A swift stroke averted the shock, and the boat shot down
the stream, leaving a track of foam behind it as Warwick
rowed with the energy of one bent on outstripping some
importunate remembrance or dogging care. Sylvia marvelled
greatly at the change which came upon him, but
held fast with flying hair and lips apart to catch the
spray, enjoying the breezy flight along a path tessellated
with broad bars of blue and gold. The race ended as
abruptly as it began, and Warwick seemed the winner,
for when they touched the coast of a floating lily-island,
the cloud was gone. As he shipped his oars he turned,
saying, with very much the look and manner of a pleasant
boy       

"You were asleep when we passed this morning; but I
know you like lilies, so let us go a fishing."

"That I do!" cried Sylvia, capturing a great white
flower with a clutch that nearly took her overboard. Warwick
drew her back and did the gathering himself.

"Enough, sir, quite enough. Here are plenty to trim
our table and ourselves with; leave the rest for other voyagers
who may come this way."[68]

As Warwick offered her the dripping nosegay he looked
at the white hand scored with scarlet lines.

"Poor hand! let the lilies comfort it. You are a true
woman, Miss Sylvia, for though your palm is purple there's
not a stain upon your lips, and you have neither worked
nor suffered for yourself it seems."

"I don't deserve that compliment, because I was only
intent on outdoing you if possible; so you are mistaken
again you see."

"Not entirely, I think. Some faces are so true an index
of character that one cannot be mistaken. If you doubt
this look down into the river, and such an one will inevitably
smile back at you."

Pleased, yet somewhat abashed, Sylvia busied herself in
knotting up the long brown stems and tinging her nose
with yellow pollen as she inhaled the bitter-sweet breath of
the lilies. But when Warwick turned to resume the oars,
she said       

"Let us float out as we floated in. It is so still and
lovely here I like to stay and enjoy it, for we may never
see just such a scene again."

He obeyed, and both sat silent, watching the meadows
that lay green and low along the shore, feeding their eyes
with the beauty of the landscape, till its peaceful spirit
seemed to pass into their own, and lend a subtle charm to
that hour, which henceforth was to stand apart, serene and
happy, in their memories forever. A still August day, with
a shimmer in the air that veiled the distant hills with the
mellow haze, no artist ever truly caught. Midsummer
warmth and ripeness brooded in the verdure of field and
forest. Wafts of fragrance went wandering by from new-mown
meadows and gardens full of bloom. All the sky[69]
wore its serenest blue, and up the river came frolic winds,
ruffling the lily leaves until they showed their purple linings,
sweeping shadowy ripples through the long grass, and
lifting the locks from Sylvia's forehead with a grateful
touch, as she sat softly swaying with the swaying of the
boat. Slowly they drifted out into the current, slowly
Warwick cleft the water with reluctant stroke, and slowly
Sylvia's mind woke from its trance of dreamy delight, as
with a gesture of assent she said       

"Yes, I am ready now. That was a happy little moment,
and I am glad to have lived it, for such times return
to refresh me when many a more stirring one is quite forgotten."
A moment after she added, eagerly, as a new
object of interest appeared: "Mr. Warwick, I see smoke.
I know there is a wood on fire; I want to see it; please
land again."

He glanced over his shoulder at the black cloud trailing
away before the wind, saw Sylvia's desire in her face, and
silently complied; for being a keen student of character,
he was willing to prolong an interview that gave him
glimpses of a nature in which the woman and the child
were curiously blended.

"I love fire, and that must be a grand one, if we could
only see it well. This bank is not high enough; let us go
nearer and enjoy it," said Sylvia, finding that an orchard
and a knoll or two intercepted the view of the burning
wood.

"It is too far."

"Not at all. I am no helpless, fine lady. I can walk,
run, and climb like any boy; so you need have no fears for
me. I may never see such a sight again, and you know
you'd go if you were alone. Please come, Mr. Warwick."[70]

"I promised Mark to take care of you, and for the very
reason that you love fire, I'd rather not take you into that
furnace, lest you never come out again. Let us go back
immediately."

The decision of his tone ruffled Sylvia, and she turned
wilful at once, saying in a tone as decided as his own       

"No; I wish to see it. I am always allowed to do what
I wish, so I shall go;" with which mutinous remark she
walked straight away towards the burning wood.

Warwick looked after her, indulging a momentary desire
to carry her back to the boat, like a naughty child. But
the resolute aspect of the figure going on before him, convinced
him that the attempt would be a failure, and with
an amused expression he leisurely followed her.

Sylvia had not walked five minutes before she was satisfied
that it was too far; but having rebelled, she would
not own herself in the wrong, and being perverse, insisted
upon carrying her point, though she walked all night. On
she went over walls, under rails, across brooks, along the
furrows of more than one ploughed field, and in among the
rustling corn, that turned its broad leaves to the sun,
always in advance of her companion, who followed with
exemplary submission, but also with a satirical smile, that
spurred her on as no other demonstration could have done.
Six o'clock sounded from the church behind the hill; still
the wood seemed to recede as she pursued, still close behind
her came the steady footfalls, with no sound of weariness
in them, and still Sylvia kept on, till, breathless, but successful,
she reached the object of her search.

Keeping to the windward of the smoke, she gained a
rocky spot still warm and blackened by the late passage of
the flames, and pausing there, forgot her own pranks in[71]
watching those which the fire played before her eyes.
Many acres were burning, the air was full of the rush and
roar of the victorious element, the crash of trees that fell
before it, and the shouts of men who fought it unavailingly.

"Ah, this is grand! I wish Mark and Mr. Moor were
here. Aren't you glad you came, sir?"

Sylvia glanced up at her companion, as he stood regarding
the scene with the intent, alert expression one often
sees in a fine hound when he scents danger in the air. But
Warwick did not answer, for as she spoke a long, sharp cry
of human suffering rose above the tumult, terribly distinct
and full of ominous suggestion.

"Someone was killed when that tree fell! Stay here
till I come back;" and Adam strode away into the wood
as if his place were where the peril lay.

For ten minutes Sylvia waited, pale and anxious; then
her patience gave out, and saying to herself, "I can go
where he does, and women are always more helpful than
men at such times," she followed in the direction whence
came the fitful sound of voices. The ground was hot underneath
her feet, red eyes winked at her from the blackened
sod, and fiery tongues darted up here and there, as if
the flames were lurking still, ready for another outbreak.
Intent upon her charitable errand, and excited by the novel
scene, she pushed recklessly on, leaping charred logs, skirting
still burning stumps, and peering eagerly into the dun
veil that wavered to and fro. The appearance of an impassable
ditch obliged her to halt, and pausing to take
breath, she became aware that she had lost her way. The
echo of voices had ceased, a red glare was deepening in
front, and clouds of smoke enveloped her in a stifling atmosphere.
A sense of bewilderment crept over her; she[72]
knew not where she was; and after a rapid flight in what
she believed a safe direction had been cut short by the fall
of a blazing tree before her, she stood still, taking counsel
with herself. Darkness and danger seemed to encompass
her, fire flickered on every side, and suffocating vapors
shrouded earth and sky. A bare rock suggested one hope
of safety, and muffling her head in her skirt, she lay down
faint and blind, with a dull pain in her temples, and a fear
at her heart fast deepening into terror, as her breath grew
painful and her head began to swim.

"This is the last of the pleasant voyage! Oh, why does
no one think of me?"

As the regret rose, a cry of suffering and entreaty broke
from her. She had not called for help till now, thinking
herself too remote, her voice too feeble to overpower the
din about her. But some one had thought of her, for as
the cry left her lips steps came crashing through the wood,
a pair of strong arms caught her up, and before she could
collect her scattered senses she was set down beyond all
danger on the green bank of a little pool.

"Well, salamander, have you had fire enough?" asked
Warwick, as he dashed a handful of water in her face with
such energetic goodwill that it took her breath away.

"Yes, oh yes,       and of water, too! Please stop, and let
me get my breath!" gasped Sylvia, warding off a second
baptism and staring dizzily about her.

"Why did you quit the place where I left you?" was
the next question, somewhat sternly put.

"I wanted to know what had happened."

"So you walked into a bonfire to satisfy your curiosity,
though you had been told to keep out of it? You'd never
make a Casabianca."[73]

"I hope not, for of all silly children, that boy was the
silliest, and he deserved to be blown up for his want of
common sense," cried the girl, petulantly.

"Obedience is an old-fashioned virtue, which you would
do well to cultivate along with your common sense, young
lady."

Sylvia changed the subject, for Warwick stood regarding
her with an irate expression that was somewhat alarming.
Fanning herself with the wet hat, she asked abruptly       

"Was the man hurt, sir?"

"Yes."

"Very much?"

"Yes."

"Can I not do something for him? He is very far from
any house, and I have some experience in wounds."

"He is past all help, above all want now."

"Dead, Mr. Warwick?"

"Quite dead."

Sylvia sat down as suddenly as she had risen, and covered
her face with a shiver, remembering that her own wilfulness
had tempted a like fate, and she too, might now
have been 'past help, above all want.' Warwick went
down to the pool to bathe his hot face and blackened hands;
as he returned Sylvia met him with a submissive       

"I will go back now if you are ready, sir."

If the way had seemed long in coming it was doubly so
in returning, for neither pride nor perversity sustained her
now, and every step cost an effort. "I can rest in the boat,"
was her sustaining thought; great therefore was her dismay
when on reaching the river no boat was to be seen.

"Why, Mr. Warwick, where is it?"

"A long way down the river by this time, probably.[74]
Believing that we landed only for a moment, I did not fasten
it, and the tide has carried it away."

"But what shall we do?"

"One of two things,       spend the night here, or go round
by the bridge."

"Is it far?"

"Some three or four miles, I think."

"Is there no shorter way? no boat or carriage to be
had?"

"If you care to wait, I can look for our runaway, or get
a wagon from the town."

"It is growing late and you would be gone a long time, I
suppose?"

"Probably."

"Which had we better do?"

"I should not venture to advise. Suit yourself, I will
obey orders."

"If you were alone what would you do?"

"Swim across."

Sylvia looked disturbed, Warwick impenetrable, the river
wide, the road long, and the cliffs the most inaccessible
of places. An impressive pause ensued, then she said
frankly       

"It is my own fault and I'll take the consequences. I
choose the bridge and leave you the river. If I don't appear
till dawn, tell Mark I sent him a good night," and
girding up her energies she walked bravely off with much
external composure and internal chagrin.

As before, Warwick followed in silence. For a time
she kept in advance, then allowed him to gain upon her,
and presently fell behind, plodding doggedly on through
thick and thin, vainly trying to conceal the hunger and[75]
fatigue that were fast robbing her of both strength and
spirits. Adam watched her with a masculine sense of the
justice of the retribution which his wilful comrade had
brought upon herself. But as he saw the elasticity leave
her steps, the color fade from her cheeks, the resolute
mouth relax, and the wistful eyes dim once or twice with
tears of weariness and vexation, pity got the better of pique,
and he relented. His steady tramp came to a halt, and
stopping by a wayside spring, he pointed to a mossy stone,
saying with no hint of superior powers       

"We are tired, let us rest."

Sylvia dropped down at once, and for a few minutes
neither spoke, for the air was full of sounds more pertinent
to the summer night than human voices. From the copse
behind them, came the coo of wood-pigeons, from the grass
at their feet the plaintive chirp of crickets; a busy breeze
whispered through the willow, the little spring dripped
musically from the rock, and across the meadows came the
sweet chime of a bell. Twilight was creeping over forest,
hill, and stream, and seemed to drop refreshment and repose
upon all weariness of soul and body, more grateful to
Sylvia, than the welcome seat and leafy cup of water Warwick
brought her from the spring.

The appearance of a thirsty sparrow gave her thoughts a
pleasant turn, for, sitting motionless, she watched the little
creature trip down to the pool, drink and bathe, then flying
to a willow spray, dress its feathers, dry its wings, and sit
chirping softly as if it sang its evening hymn. Warwick
saw her interest, and searching in his pocket, found the
relics of a biscuit, strewed a few bits upon the ground before
him, and began a low, sweet whistle, which rose gradually
to a varied strain, alluring, spirited, and clear as any[76]
bird voice of the wood. Little sparrow ceased his twitter,
listened with outstretched neck and eager eye, hopping
restlessly from twig to twig, until he hung just over the
musician's head, agitated with a small flutter of surprise,
delight, and doubt. Gathering a crumb or two into his
hand, Warwick held it toward the bird, while softer, sweeter,
and more urgent rose the invitation, and nearer and
nearer drew the winged guest, fascinated by the spell.

Suddenly a belated blackbird lit upon the wall, surveyed
the group and burst into a jubilant song, that for a
moment drowned his rival's notes. Then, as if claiming
the reward, he fluttered to the grass, ate his fill, took a sip
from the mossy basin by the way, and flew singing over the
river, leaving a trail of music behind him. There was a
dash and daring about this which fired little sparrow with
emulation. His last fear seemed conquered, and he flew
confidingly to Warwick's palm, pecking the crumbs with
grateful chirps and friendly glances from its quick, bright
eye. It was a pretty picture for the girl to see; the man,
an image of power, in his hand the feathered atom, that,
with unerring instinct, divined and trusted the superior
nature which had not yet lost its passport to the world of
innocent delights that Nature gives to those who love her
best. Involuntarily Sylvia clapped her hands, and, startled
by the sudden sound, little sparrow skimmed away.

"Thank you for the pleasantest sight I've seen for many
a day. How did you learn this gentle art, Mr. Warwick?"

"I was a solitary boy, and found my only playmates in
the woods and fields. I learned their worth, they saw my
need, and when I asked their friendship, gave it freely.
Now we should go; you are very tired, let me help you."

He held his hand to her, and she put her own into it with[77]
a confidence as instinctive as the bird's. Then, hand in
hand they crossed the bridge and struck into the wilderness
again; climbing slopes still warm and odorous, passing
through dells full of chilly damps, along meadows spangled
with fire-flies, and haunted by sonorous frogs; over rocks
crisp with pale mosses, and between dark firs, where shadows
brooded, and melancholy breezes rocked themselves to sleep.
Speaking seldom, yet feeling no consciousness of silence, no
sense of restraint, for they no longer seemed like strangers
to one another, and this spontaneous friendliness lent an
indefinable charm to the dusky walk. Warwick found satisfaction
in the knowledge of her innocent faith in him, the
touch of the little hand he held, the sight of the quiet figure
at his side. Sylvia felt that it was pleasant to be the
object of his care, fancied that they would learn to know
each other better in three days of this free life than in as
many months at home, and rejoiced over the discovery of
unsuspected traits in him, like the soft lining of the chestnut
burr, to which she had compared him more than once
that afternoon. So, mutually and unconsciously yielding
to the influence of the hour and the mood it brought
them, they walked through the twilight in that eloquent
silence which often proves more persuasive than the most
fluent speech.

The welcome blaze of their own fire gladdened them at
length, and when the last step was taken, Sylvia sat down
with an inward conviction she never could get up again.
Warwick told their mishap in the fewest possible words,
while Mark, in a spasm of brotherly solicitude, goaded the
fire to a roar that his sister's feet might be dried, administered
a cordial as a preventive against cold, and prescribed
her hammock the instant supper was done. She went[78]
away with him, but a moment after she came to Warwick
with a box of Prue's ointment and a soft handkerchief stripped
into bandages.

"What now?" he asked.

"I wish to dress your burns, sir."

"They will do well enough with a little water; go you
and rest."

"Mr. Warwick, you know you ate your supper with
your left hand, and put both behind you when you saw me
looking at them. Please let me make them easier; they
were burnt for me, and I shall get no sleep till I have had
my way."

There was a curious mixture of command and entreaty
in her manner, and before their owner had time to refuse or
comply, the scorched hands were taken possession of, the
red blisters covered with a cool bandage, and the frown of
pain smoothed out of Warwick's forehead by the prospect
of relief. As she tied the last knot, Sylvia glanced up
with a look that mutely asked pardon for past waywardness,
and expressed gratitude for past help; then, as if her
heart were set at rest, she was gone before her patient could
return his thanks.

She did not reappear, Mark went to send a lad after the
lost boat, and the two friends were left alone; Warwick
watching the blaze, Moor watching him, till, with a nod
toward a pair of diminutive boots that stood turning out
their toes before the fire, Adam said       

"The wearer of those defiant-looking articles is the most
capricious piece of humanity it was ever my fortune to see.
You have no idea of the life she has led me since you left."

"I can imagine it."

"She is as freakish, and wears as many shapes as Puck;[79]
a gnat, a will-o'-the-wisp, a Sister of Charity, a meek-faced
child; and one does not know in which guise she pleases
most. Hard the task of him who has and tries to hold
her."

"Hard yet happy; for a word will tame the high spirit,
a look touch the warm heart, a kind act be repaid with one
still kinder. She is a woman to be studied well, taught
tenderly, and, being won, cherished with an affection that
knows no shadow of a change."

Moor spoke low, and on his face the fire-light seemed to
shed a ruddier glow than it had done before. Warwick
eyed him keenly for a moment, then said, with his usual
abruptness       

"Geoffrey, you should marry."

"Set me the example by mortgaging your own heart,
Adam."

"I have."

"I thought so. Tell me the romance."

"It is the old story       a handsome woman, a foolish man;
a few weeks of doubt, a few of happiness; then the two
stand apart to view the leap before they take it; after that,
peace or purgatory, as they choose well or ill."

"When is the probation over, Adam?"

"In June, God willing."

The hope of deliverance gave to Warwick's tone the
fervor of desire, and led his friend to believe in the existence
of a passion deep and strong as the heart he knew so
well. No further confessions disturbed his satisfaction, for
Warwick scorned complaint; pity he would not receive,
sympathy was powerless to undo the past, time alone would
mend it, and to time he looked for help. He rose presently
as if bedward bound, but paused behind Moor, turned his[80]
face upward, and said, bending on it a look given to this
friend alone       

"If my confidence were a good gift, you should have it.
But my experience must not mar your faith in womankind.
Keep it as chivalrous as ever, and may God send you the
mate whom you deserve. Geoffrey, good night."

"Good night, Adam."

And with a hand-shake more expressive of affection than
many a tenderer demonstration, they parted       Warwick to
watch the stars for hours, and Moor to muse beside the fire
till the little boots were dry.




CHAPTER V.

A GOLDEN WEDDING.


Hitherto they had been a most decorous crew, but the[81]
next morning something in the air seemed to cause a general
overflow of spirits, and they went up the river like a party
of children on a merry-making. Sylvia decorated herself
with garlands till she looked like a mermaid; Mark, as
skipper, issued his orders with the true Marblehead twang;
Moor kept up a fire of pun-provoking raillery; Warwick
sung like a jovial giant; while the Kelpie danced over the
water as if inspired with the universal gayety, and the very
ripples seemed to laugh as they hurried by.

"Mark, there is a boat coming up behind us with three
gentlemen in it, who evidently intend to pass us with a
great display of skill. Of course you won't let it," said
Sylvia, welcoming the prospect of a race.

Her brother looked over his shoulder, took a critical survey,
and nodded approvingly.

"They are worth a lesson, and shall have it. Easy, now,
till they pass; then hard all, and give them a specimen of
high art."

A sudden lull ensued on board the Kelpie while the blue
shirts approached, caught, and passed with a great display
of science, as Sylvia had prophesied, and as good an imitation
of the demeanor of experienced watermen as could be[82]
assumed by a trio of studious youths not yet out of their
teens. As the foam of their wake broke against the other
boat's side, Mark hailed them       

"Good morning, gentlemen! We'll wait for you above
there, at the bend."

"All serene," returned the rival helmsman, with a bow
in honor of Sylvia, while the other two caused a perceptible
increase in the speed of the "Juanita," whose
sentimental name was not at all in keeping with its rakish
appearance.

"Short-sighted infants, to waste their wind in that style;
but they pull well for their years," observed Mark, paternally,
as he waited till the others had gained sufficient
advantage to make the race a more equal one. "Now,
then!" he whispered a moment after; and, as if suddenly
endowed with life, the Kelpie shot away with the smooth
speed given by strength and skill. Sylvia watched both
boats, yearning to take an oar herself, yet full of admiration
for the well-trained rowers, whose swift strokes set the
river in a foam and made the moment one of pleasure and
excitement. The blue shirts did their best against competitors
who had rowed in many crafts and many waters.
They kept the advantage till near the bend, then Mark's
crew lent their reserved strength to a final effort, and bending
to their oars with a will, gained steadily, till, with a
triumphant stroke, they swept far ahead, and with oars at
rest waited in magnanimous silence till the Juanita came
up, gracefully confessing her defeat by a good-humored
cheer from her panting crew.

For a moment the two boats floated side by side, while
the young men interchanged compliments and jokes, for a
river is a highway where all travellers may salute each[83]
other, and college boys are "Hail fellow! well met" with
all the world.

Sylvia sat watching the lads, and one among them struck
her fancy. The helmsman who had bowed to her was slight
and swarthy, with Southern eyes, vivacious manners, and a
singularly melodious voice. A Spaniard, she thought, and
pleased herself with this picturesque figure till a traitorous
smile about the young man's mouth betrayed that he was
not unconscious of her regard. She colored as she met the
glance of mingled mirth and admiration that he gave her,
and hastily began to pull off the weedy decorations which
she had forgotten. But she paused presently, for she heard
a surprised voice exclaim       

"Why, Warwick! is that you or your ghost?"

Looking up Sylvia saw Adam lift the hat he had pulled
over his brows, and take a slender brown hand extended over
the boat-side with something like reluctance, as he answered
the question in Spanish. A short conversation ensued, in
which the dark stranger seemed to ask innumerable questions,
Warwick to give curt replies, and the names Gabriel
and Ottila to occur with familiar frequency. Sylvia knew
nothing of the language, but received an impression that
Warwick was not overjoyed at the meeting; that the youth
was both pleased and perplexed by finding him there; and
that neither parted with much regret as the distance slowly
widened between the boats, and with a farewell salute parted
company, each taking a different branch of the river, which
divided just there.

For the first time Warwick allowed Mark to take his
place at the oar, and sat looking into the clear depths below
as if some scene lay there which other eyes could not discover.[84]

"Who was the olive-colored party with the fine eyes and
foreign accent?" asked Mark, lazily rowing.

"Gabriel André."

"Is he an Italian?"

"No; a Cuban."

"I forgot you had tried that mixture of Spain and Alabama.
How was it?"

"As such climates always are to me,       intoxicating to-day,
enervating to-morrow."

"How long were you there?"

"Three months."

"I feel tropically inclined, so tell us about it."

"There is nothing to tell."

"I'll prove that by a catechism. Where did you stay?"

"In Havana."

"Of course, but with whom?"

"Gabriel André."

"The father of the saffron youth?"

"Yes."

"Of whom did the family consist?"

"Four persons."

"Mark, leave Mr. Warwick alone."

"As long as he answers I shall question. Name the
four persons, Adam."

"Gabriel, sen., Dolores his wife, Gabriel, jun., Catalina,
his sister."

"Ah! now we progress. Was señorita Catalina as
comely as her brother?"

"More so."

"You adored her, of course?"

"I loved her."

"Great heavens! what discoveries we make. He likes[85]
it, I know by the satirical glimmer in his eye; therefore I
continue. She adored you, of course?"

"She loved me."

"You will return and marry her?"

"No."

"Your depravity appalls me."

"Did I volunteer its discovery?"

"I demand it now. You left this girl believing that you
adored her?"

"She knew I was fond of her."

"The parting was tender?"

"On her part."

"Iceberg! She wept in your arms?"

"And gave me an orange."

"You cherished it, of course?"

"I ate it immediately."

"What want of sentiment! You promised to return?"

"Yes."

"But will never keep the promise?"

"I never break one."

"Yet will not marry her?"

"By no means."

"Ask how old the lady was, Mark?"

"Age, Warwick?"

"Seven."

Mark caught a crab of the largest size at this reply, and
remained where he fell, among the ruins of the castle in
Spain, which he had erected with the scanty materials
vouchsafed to him, while Warwick went back to his meditations.

A drop of rain roused Sylvia from the contemplation of
an imaginary portrait of the little Cuban girl, and looking[86]
skyward she saw that the frolicsome wind had prepared a
practical joke for them in the shape of a thunder-shower.
A consultation was held, and it was decided to row on till a
house appeared, in which they would take refuge till the
storm was over. On they went, but the rain was in greater
haste than they, and a summary drenching was effected
before the toot of a dinner-horn guided them to shelter.
Landing they marched over the fields, a moist and mirthful
company, toward a red farm-house standing under venerable
elms, with a patriarchal air which promised hospitable
treatment and good cheer. A promise speedily fulfilled by
the lively old woman, who appeared with an energetic
"Shoo!" for the speckled hens congregated in the porch,
and a hearty welcome for the weather-beaten strangers.

"Sakes alive!" she exclaimed; "you be in a mess, ain't
you? Come right in and make yourselves to home. Abel,
take the men folks up chamber, and fit 'em out with anything
dry you kin lay hands on. Phebe, see to this poor
little creeter, and bring her down lookin' less like a drownded
kitten. Nat, clear up your wittlin's, so's't they kin toast
their feet when they come down; and, Cinthy, don't dish
up dinner jest yet."

These directions were given with such vigorous illustration,
and the old face shone with such friendly zeal, that
the four submitted at once, sure that the kind soul was
pleasing herself in serving them, and finding something
very attractive in the place, the people, and their own position.
Abel, a staid farmer of forty, obeyed his mother's
order regarding the "men folks;" and Phebe, a buxom
girl of sixteen, led Sylvia to her own room, eagerly offering
her best.

As she dried and redressed herself Sylvia made sundry[87]
discoveries, which added to the romance and the enjoyment
of the adventure. A smart gown lay on the bed in the low
chamber, also various decorations upon chair and table,
suggesting that some festival was afloat; and a few questions
elicited the facts. Grandpa had seven sons and three
daughters, all living, all married, and all blessed with flocks
of children. Grandpa's birthday was always celebrated by
a family gathering; but to-day, being the fiftieth anniversary
of his wedding, the various households had resolved
to keep it with unusual pomp; and all were coming for a
supper, a dance, and a "sing" at the end. Upon receipt
of which intelligence Sylvia proposed an immediate departure;
but the grandmother and daughter cried out at this,
pointed to the still falling rain, the lowering sky, the wet
heap on the floor, and insisted on the strangers all remaining
to enjoy the festival, and give an added interest by their
presence.

Half promising what she wholly desired, Sylvia put on
Phebe's second best blue gingham gown for the preservation
of which she added a white apron, and completing the
whole with a pair of capacious shoes, went down to find her
party and reveal the state of affairs. They were bestowed
in the prim, best parlor, and greeted her with a peal of
laughter, for all were en costume. Abel was a stout man,
and his garments hung upon Moor with a melancholy air;
Mark had disdained them, and with an eye to effect laid
hands on an old uniform, in which he looked like a volunteer
of 1812; while Warwick's superior height placed
Abel's wardrobe out of the question; and grandpa, taller
than any of his seven goodly sons, supplied him with a sober
suit,       roomy, square-flapped, and venerable,       which became
him, and with his beard produced the curious effect[88]
of a youthful patriarch. To Sylvia's relief it was unanimously
decided to remain, trusting to their own penetration
to discover the most agreeable method of returning the
favor; and regarding the adventure as a welcome change,
after two days' solitude, all went out to dinner prepared to
enact their parts with spirit.

The meal being despatched, Mark and Warwick went to
help Abel with some out-door arrangements; and begging
grandma to consider him one of her own boys, Moor tied
on an apron and fell to work with Sylvia, laying the long
table which was to receive the coming stores. True breeding
is often as soon felt by the uncultivated as by the
cultivated; and the zeal with which the strangers threw
themselves into the business of the hour won the family,
and placed them all in friendly relations at once. The old
lady let them do what they would, admiring everything, and
declaring over and over again that her new assistants "beat
her boys and girls to nothin' with their tastiness and smartness."
Sylvia trimmed the table with common flowers till
it was an inviting sight before a viand appeared upon it,
and hung green boughs about the room, with candles here
and there to lend a festal light. Moor trundled a great
cheese in from the dairy, brought milk-pans without mishap,
disposed dishes, and caused Nat to cleave to him by
the administration of surreptitious titbits and jocular suggestions;
while Phebe tumbled about in every one's way,
quite wild with excitement; and grandma stood in her
pantry like a culinary general, swaying a big knife for a
baton, as she issued orders and marshalled her forces, the
busiest and merriest of them all.

When the last touch was given, Moor discarded his apron
and went to join Mark. Sylvia presided over Phebe's[89]
toilet, and then sat herself down to support Nat through
the trying half hour before, as he expressed it, "the party
came in." The twelve years' boy was a cripple, one of
those household blessings which, in the guise of an affliction,
keep many hearts tenderly united by a common love
and pity. A cheerful creature, always chirping like a
cricket on the hearth as he sat carving or turning bits
of wood into useful or ornamental shapes for such as cared
to buy them of him, and hoarding up the proceeds like a
little miser for one more helpless than himself.

"What are these, Nat?" asked Sylvia, with the interest
that always won small people, because their quick instincts
felt that it was sincere.

"Them are spoons       'postle spoons, they call 'em. You
see I've got a cousin what reads a sight, and one day he
says to me, 'Nat, in a book I see somethin' about a set of
spoons with a 'postle's head on each of 'em; you make
some and they'll sell, I bet.' So I got gramper's Bible,
found the picters of the 'postles, and worked and worked
till I got the faces good; and now it's fun, for they do sell,
and I'm savin' up a lot. It ain't for me, you know, but
mother, 'cause she's wuss'n I be."

"Is she sick, Nat?"

"Oh, ain't she! Why she hasn't stood up this nine
year. We was smashed in a wagon that tipped over when
I was three years old. It done somethin' to my legs, but it
broke her back, and made her no use, only jest to pet me,
and keep us all kind of stiddy, you know. Ain't you seen
her? Don't you want to?"

"Would she like it?"

"She admires to see folks, and asked about you at dinner;
so I guess you'd better go see her. Look ahere, you[90]
like them spoons, and I'm agoin' to give you one; I'd
give you all on 'em if they wasn't promised. I can make
one more in time, so you jest take your pick, 'cause I like
you, and want you not to forgit me."

Sylvia chose Saint John, because it resembled Moor, she
thought; bespoke and paid for a whole set, and privately
resolved to send tools and rare woods to the little artist that
he might serve his mother in his own pretty way. Then
Nat took up his crutches and hopped nimbly before her to
the room, where a plain, serene-faced woman lay knitting,
with her best cap on, her clean handkerchief and large
green fan laid out upon the coverlet. This was evidently the
best room of the house; and as Sylvia sat talking to the invalid
her eye discovered many traces of that refinement
which comes through the affections. Nothing seemed too
good for "daughter Patience;" birds, books, flowers, and
pictures were plentiful here though visible nowhere else.
Two easy-chairs beside the bed showed where the old
folks oftenest sat; Abel's home corner was there by the
antique desk covered with farmers' literature and samples
of seeds; Phebe's work-basket stood in the window; Nat's
lathe in the sunniest corner; and from the speckless carpet
to the canary's clear water-glass all was exquisitely neat,
for love and labor were the handmaids who served the helpless
woman and asked no wages but her comfort.

Sylvia amused her new friends mightily, for finding that
neither mother nor son had any complaints to make, any
sympathy to ask, she exerted herself to give them what
both needed, and kept them laughing by a lively recital of
her voyage and its mishaps.

"Ain't she prime, mother?" was Nat's candid commentary
when the story ended, and he emerged red and shiny[91]
from the pillows where he had burrowed with boyish explosions
of delight.

"She's very kind, dear, to amuse two stay-at-home folks
like you and me, who seldom see what's going on outside
four walls. You have a merry heart, miss, and I hope
will keep it all your days, for it's a blessed thing to own."

"I think you have something better, a contented one,"
said Sylvia, as the woman regarded her with no sign of
envy or regret.

"I ought to have; nine years on a body's back can
teach a sight of things that are wuth knowin'. I've learnt
patience pretty well I guess, and contentedness ain't fur
away, for though it sometimes seems ruther long to look
forward to, perhaps nine more years layin' here, I jest
remember it might have been wuss, and if I don't do
much now there's all eternity to come."

Something in the woman's manner struck Sylvia as she
watched her softly beating some tune on the sheet with her
quiet eyes turned toward the light. Many sermons had
been less eloquent to the girl than the look, the tone, the
cheerful resignation of that plain face. She stooped and
kissed it, saying gently       

"I shall remember this."

"Hooray! There they be; I hear Ben!"

And away clattered Nat to be immediately absorbed into
the embraces of a swarm of relatives who now began to
arrive in a steady stream. Old and young, large and
small, rich and poor, with overflowing hands or trifles humbly
given, all were received alike, all hugged by grandpa,
kissed by grandma, shaken half breathless by Uncle Abel,
welcomed by Aunt Patience, and danced round by Phebe
and Nat till the house seemed a great hive of hilarious and[92]
affectionate bees. At first the strangers stood apart, but
Phebe spread their story with such complimentary additions
of her own that the family circle opened wide and took
them in at once.

Sylvia was enraptured with the wilderness of babies, and
leaving the others to their own devices followed the matrons
to "Patience's room," and gave herself up to the pleasant
tyranny of the small potentates, who swarmed over her as
she sat on the floor, tugging at her hair, exploring her
eyes, covering her with moist kisses, and keeping up a
babble of little voices more delightful to her than the discourse
of the flattered mammas who benignly surveyed her
admiration and their offspring's prowess.

The young people went to romp in the barn; the men,
armed with umbrellas, turned out en masse to inspect the
farm and stock, and compare notes over pig pens and garden
gates. But Sylvia lingered where she was, enjoying a
scene which filled her with a tender pain and pleasure, for
each baby was laid on grandma's knee, its small virtues,
vices, ailments, and accomplishments rehearsed, its beauties
examined, its strength tested, and the verdict of the family
oracle pronounced upon it as it was cradled, kissed, and
blessed on the kind old heart which had room for every
care and joy of those who called her mother. It was a
sight the girl never forgot, because just then she was ready
to receive it. Her best lessons did not come from books,
and she learned one then as she saw the fairest success of
a woman's life while watching this happy grandmother with
fresh faces framing her withered one, daughterly voices
chorusing good wishes, and the harvest of half a century of
wedded life beautifully garnered in her arms.

The fragrance of coffee and recollections of Cynthia's[93]
joyful aberrations at such periods caused a breaking up of
the maternal conclave. The babies were borne away to
simmer between blankets until called for. The women
unpacked baskets, brooded over teapots, and kept up an
harmonious clack as the table was spread with pyramids of
cake, regiments of pies, quagmires of jelly, snow-banks of
bread, and gold mines of butter; every possible article of
food, from baked beans to wedding cake, finding a place on
that sacrificial altar.

Fearing to be in the way, Sylvia departed to the barn,
where she found her party in a chaotic Babel; for the offshoots
had been as fruitful as the parent tree, and some
four dozen young immortals were in full riot. The bashful
roosting with the hens on remote lofts and beams; the bold
flirting or playing in the full light of day; the boys whooping,
the girls screaming, all effervescing as if their spirits
had reached the explosive point and must find vent in noise.
Mark was in his element, introducing all manner of new
games, the liveliest of the old and keeping the revel at its
height; for rosy, bright-eyed girls were plenty, and the
ancient uniform universally approved. Warwick had a
flock of lads about him absorbed in the marvels he was
producing with knife, stick, and string; and Moor a rival
flock of little lasses breathless with interest in the tales he
told. One on each knee, two at each side, four in a row
on the hay at his feet, and the boldest of all with an arm
about his neck and a curly head upon his shoulder, for
Uncle Abel's clothes seemed to invest the wearer with a
passport to their confidence at once. Sylvia joined this
group and partook of a quiet entertainment with as childlike
a relish as any of them, while the merry tumult went
on about her.[94]

The toot of the horn sent the whole barnful streaming
into the house like a flock of hungry chickens, where, by
some process known only to the mothers of large families,
every one was wedged close about the table, and the feast
began. This was none of your stand-up, wafery, bread and
butter teas, but a thorough-going, sit-down supper, and
all settled themselves with a smiling satisfaction, prophetic
of great powers and an equal willingness to employ them.
A detachment of half-grown girls was drawn up behind
grandma, as waiters; Sylvia insisted on being one of them,
and proved herself a neat-handed Phillis, though for a time
slightly bewildered by the gastronomic performances she
beheld. Babies ate pickles, small boys sequestered pie with
a velocity that made her wink, women swam in the tea, and
the men, metaphorically speaking, swept over the table like
a swarm of locusts, while the host and hostess beamed upon
one another and their robust descendants with an honest
pride, which was beautiful to see.

"That Mr. Wackett ain't eat scursely nothin', he jest
sets lookin' round kinder 'mazed like. Do go and make
him fall to on somethin', or I shan't take a mite of comfort
in my vittles," said grandma, as the girl came with an
empty cup.

"He is enjoying it with all his heart and eyes, ma'am,
for we don't see such fine spectacles every day. I'll take
him something that he likes and make him eat it."

"Sakes alive! be you to be Mis' Wackett? I'd no idee
of it, you look so young."

"Nor I; we are only friends, ma'am."

"Oh!" and the monosyllable was immensely expressive,
as the old lady confided a knowing nod to the teapot, into
whose depths she was just then peering. Sylvia walked[95]
away wondering why persons were always thinking and saying
such things.

As she paused behind Warwick's chair with a glass of
cream and a round of brown bread, he looked up at her
with his blandest expression, though a touch of something
like regret was in his voice.

"This is a sight worth living eighty hard years to see, and
I envy that old couple as I never envied any one before.
To rear ten virtuous children, put ten useful men and
women into the world, and give them health and courage to
work out their own salvation as these honest souls will do,
is a better job done for the Lord, than winning a battle, or
ruling a State. Here is all honor to them. Drink it with
me."

He put the glass to her lips, drank what she left, and
rising, placed her in his seat with the decisive air which
few resisted.

"You take no thought for yourself and are doing too
much; sit here a little, and let me take a few steps where
you have taken many."

He served her, and standing at her back, bent now and
then to speak, still with that softened look upon the face
so seldom stirred by the gentler emotions that lay far
down in that deep heart of his; for never had he felt so
solitary.

All things must have an end, even a family feast, and
by the time the last boy's buttons peremptorily announced,
'Thus far shalt thou go and no farther,' all professed themselves
satisfied, and a general uprising took place. The
surplus population were herded in parlor and chambers,
while a few energetic hands cleared away, and with much
clattering of dishes and wafting of towels, left grandma's[96]
spandy clean premises as immaculate as ever. It was dark
when all was done, so the kitchen was cleared, the candles
lighted, Patience's door set open, and little Nat established
in an impromptu orchestra, composed of a table and a
chair, whence the first squeak of his fiddle proclaimed that
the ball had begun.

Everybody danced; the babies stacked on Patience's bed,
or penned behind chairs, sprawled and pranced in unsteady
mimicry of their elders. Ungainly farmers, stiff with labor,
recalled their early days and tramped briskly as they swung
their wives about with a kindly pressure of the hard hands
that had worked so long together. Little pairs toddled
gravely through the figures, or frisked promiscuously in a
grand conglomeration of arms and legs. Gallant cousins
kissed pretty cousins at exciting periods, and were not rebuked.
Mark wrought several of these incipient lovers to a
pitch of despair, by his devotion to the comeliest damsels,
and the skill with which he executed unheard-of evolutions
before their admiring eyes; Moor led out the poorest and
the plainest with a respect that caused their homely faces
to shine, and their scant skirts to be forgotten. Warwick
skimmed his five years partner through the air in a way
that rendered her speechless with delight; and Sylvia danced
as she never danced before. With sticky-fingered boys,
sleepy with repletion, but bound to last it out; with rough-faced
men who paid her paternal compliments; with smart
youths who turned sheepish with that white lady's hand in
their big brown ones, and one ambitious lad who confided
to her his burning desire to work a sawmill, and marry a
girl with black eyes and yellow hair. While, perched aloft,
Nat bowed away till his pale face glowed, till all hearts
warmed, all feet beat responsive to the good old tunes which[97]
have put so much health into human bodies, and so much
happiness into human souls.

At the stroke of nine the last dance came. All down the
long kitchen stretched two breathless rows; grandpa and
grandma at the top, the youngest pair of grandchildren at
the bottom, and all between fathers, mothers, uncles, aunts,
and cousins, while such of the babies as were still extant,
bobbed with unabated vigor, as Nat struck up the Virginia
Reel, and the sturdy old couple led off as gallantly as the
young one who came tearing up to meet them. Away they
went, grandpa's white hair flying in the wind, grandma's
impressive cap awry with excitement, as they ambled down
the middle, and finished with a kiss when their tuneful
journey was done, amid immense applause from those who
regarded this as the crowning event of the day.

When all had had their turn, and twirled till they were
dizzy, a short lull took place, with refreshments for such as
still possessed the power of enjoying them. Then Phebe
appeared with an armful of books, and all settled themselves
for the family "sing."

Sylvia had heard much fine music, but never any that
touched her like this, for, though often discordant, it was
hearty, with that under-current of feeling which adds sweetness
to the rudest lay, and is often more attractive than the
most florid ornament or faultless execution. Every one
sang as every one had danced, with all their might; shrill
children, soft-voiced girls, lullaby-singing mothers, gruff
boys, and strong-lunged men; the old pair quavered, and
still a few indefatigable babies crowed behind their little
coops. Songs, ballads, comic airs, popular melodies, and
hymns, came in rapid succession. And when they ended
with that song which should be classed with sacred music[98]
for association's sake, and standing hand in hand about the
room with the golden bride and bridegroom in their midst,
sang "Home," Sylvia leaned against her brother with dim
eyes and a heart too full to sing.

Still standing thus when the last note had soared up and
died, the old man folded his hands and began to pray. It
was an old-fashioned prayer, such as the girl had never
heard from the Bishop's lips; ungrammatical, inelegant, and
long. A quiet talk with God, manly in its straightforward
confession of short-comings, childlike in its appeal for
guidance, fervent in its gratitude for all good gifts, and the
crowning one of loving children. As if close intercourse
had made the two familiar, this human father turned to the
Divine, as these sons and daughters turned to him, as free
to ask, as confident of a reply, as all afflictions, blessings,
cares, and crosses, were laid down before him, and the work
of eighty years submitted to his hand. There were no
sounds in the room but the one voice often tremulous with
emotion and with age, the coo of some dreaming baby, or the
low sob of some mother whose arms were empty, as the old
man stood there, rugged and white atop as the granite hills,
with the old wife at his side, a circle of sons and daughters
girdling them round, and in all hearts the thought that as
the former wedding had been made for time, this golden
one at eighty must be for eternity.

While Sylvia looked and listened a sense of genuine devotion
stole over her; the beauty and the worth of prayer
grew clear to her through the earnest speech of that unlettered
man, and for the first time she fully felt the nearness
and the dearness of the Universal Father, whom she had
been taught to fear, yet longed to love.

"Now, my children, you must go before the little folks[99]
are tuckered out," said Grandpa, heartily. "Mother and
me can't say enough toe thank you for the presents you
have fetched us, the dutiful wishes you have give us, the
pride and comfort you have allers ben toe us. I ain't no
hand at speeches, so I shan't make none, but jest say ef
any 'fliction falls on any on you, remember mother's here
toe help you bear it; ef any worldly loss comes toe you,
remember father's house is yourn while it stans, and so the
Lord bless and keep us all."

"Three cheers for gramper and grammer!" roared a
six-foot scion as a safety valve for sundry unmasculine
emotions, and three rousing hurras made the rafters ring,
struck terror to the heart of the oldest inhabitant of the
rat-haunted garret, and summarily woke all the babies.

Then the good-byes began, the flurry of wrong baskets,
pails and bundles in wrong places; the sorting out of small
folk too sleepy to know or care what became of them; the
maternal cluckings, and paternal shouts for Kitty, Cy,
Ben, Bill, or Mary Ann; the piling into vehicles with
much ramping of indignant horses unused to such late
hours; the last farewells, the roll of wheels, as one by one
the happy loads departed, and peace fell upon the household
for another year.

"I declare for't, I never had sech an out an out good
time sense I was born intoe the world. Ab'ram, you are
fit to drop, and so be I; now let's set and talk it over along
of Patience fore we go toe bed."

The old couple got into their chairs, and as they sat there
side by side, remembering that she had given no gift, Sylvia
crept behind them, and lending the magic of her voice
to the simple air, sang the fittest song for time and place       "John
Anderson my Jo." It was too much for grandma,[100]
the old heart overflowed, and reckless of the cherished cap
she laid her head on her "John's" shoulder, exclaiming
through her tears       

"That's the cap sheaf of the hull, and I can't bear no
more to-night. Ab'ram, lend me your hankchif, for I dunno
where mine is, and my face is all of a drip."

Before the red bandana had gently performed its work
in grandpa's hand, Sylvia beckoned her party from the
room, and showing them the clear moonlight night which
followed the storm, suggested that they should both save
appearances and enjoy a novel pleasure by floating homeward
instead of sleeping. The tide against which they had
pulled in coming up would sweep them rapidly along, and
make it easy to retrace in a few hours the way they had
loitered over for three days.

The pleasant excitement of the evening had not yet subsided,
and all applauded the plan as a fit finale to their
voyage. The old lady strongly objected, but the young
people overruled her, and being re-equipped in their damaged
garments they bade the friendly family a grateful
adieu, left their more solid thanks under Nat's pillow, and
re-embarked upon their shining road.

All night Sylvia lay under the canopy of boughs her
brother made to shield her from the dew, listening to the
soft sounds about her, the twitter of a restless bird, the
bleat of some belated lamb, the ripple of a brook babbling
like a baby in its sleep. All night she watched the changing
shores, silvery green or dark with slumberous shadow,
and followed the moon in its tranquil journey through the
sky. When it set, she drew her cloak about her, and, pillowing
her head upon her arm, exchanged the waking for a
sleeping dream.[101]

A thick mist encompassed her when she awoke. Above
the sun shone dimly, below rose and fell the billows of the
sea, before her sounded the city's fitful hum, and far behind
her lay the green wilderness where she had lived and
learned so much. Slowly the fog lifted, the sun came dazzling
down upon the sea, and out into the open bay they
sailed with the pennon streaming in the morning wind.
But still with backward glance the girl watched the misty
wall that rose between her and the charmed river, and still
with yearning heart confessed how sweet that brief experience
had been, for though she had not yet discovered it,
like


"The fairy Lady of Shalott,
She had left the web and left the loom,
Had seen the water lilies bloom,
Had seen the helmet and the plume,
And had looked down to Camelot."



CHAPTER VI.

WHY SYLVIA WAS HAPPY.


"I never did understand you, Sylvia; and this last[102]
month you have been a perfect enigma to me."

With rocking-chair in full action, suspended needle and
thoughtful expression, Miss Yule had watched her sister
for ten minutes as she sat with her work at her feet, her
hands folded on her lap, and her eyes dreamily fixed on
vacancy.

"I always was to myself, Prue, and am more so than
ever now," answered Sylvia, waking out of her reverie with
a smile that proved it had been a pleasant one.

"There must be some reason for this great change in
you. Come, tell me, dear."

With a motherly gesture Miss Yule drew the girl to her
knee, brushed back the bright hair, and looked into the face
so freely turned to hers. Through all the years they had
been together, the elder sister had never seen before the
expression which the younger's face now wore. A vague
expectancy sat in her eyes, some nameless content sweetened
her smile, a beautiful repose replaced the varying enthusiasm,
listlessness, and melancholy that used to haunt her
countenance and make it such a study. Miss Yule could
not read the secret of the change, yet felt its novel charm;
Sylvia could not explain it, though penetrated by its power;[103]
and for a moment the sisters looked into each other's faces,
wondering why each seemed altered. Then Prue, who never
wasted much time in speculations of any kind, shook her
head, and repeated       

"I don't understand it, but it must be right, because
you are so improved in every way. Ever since that wild
trip up the river you have been growing quiet, lovable, and
cheerful, and I really begin to hope that you will become
like other people."

"I only know that I am happy, Prue. Why it is so I
cannot tell; but now I seldom have the old dissatisfied and
restless feeling. Everything looks pleasant to me, every
one seems kind, and life begins to be both sweet and earnest.
It is only one of my moods, I suppose; but I am grateful
for it, and pray that it may last."

So earnestly she spoke, so cheerfully she smiled, that
Miss Yule blessed the mood and echoed Sylvia's wish,
exclaiming in the next breath, with a sudden inspiration       

"My, dear, I've got it! You are growing up."

"I think I am. You tried to make a woman of me at
sixteen, but it was impossible until the right time came.
That wild trip up the river, as you call it, did more for me
than I can ever tell, and when I seemed most like a child
I was learning to be a woman."

"Well, my dear, go on as you've begun, and I shall be
more than satisfied. What merry-making is on foot to-night?
Mark and these friends of his keep you in constant
motion with their riding, rowing, and rambling excursions,
and if it did not agree with you so excellently, I really
should like a little quiet after a month of bustle."

"They are only coming up as usual, and that reminds
me that I must go and dress."[104]

"There is another new change, Sylvia. You never used
to care what you wore or how you looked, no matter how
much time and trouble I expended on you and your wardrobe.
Now you do care, and it does my heart good to see
you always charmingly dressed, and looking your prettiest,"
said Miss Yule, with the satisfaction of a woman who
heartily believed in costume as well as all the other elegances
and proprieties of fashionable life.

"Am I ever that, Prue?" asked Sylvia, pausing on the
threshold with a shy yet wistful glance.

"Ever what, dear?"

"Pretty?"

"Always so to me; and now I think every one finds you
very attractive because you try to please, and seem to succeed
delightfully."

Sylvia had never asked that question before, had never
seemed to know or care, and could not have chosen a more
auspicious moment for her frank inquiry than the present.
The answer seemed to satisfy her, and smiling at some
blithe anticipation of her own, she went away to make a
lampless toilet in the dusk, which proved how slight a hold
the feminine passion for making one's self pretty had yet
taken upon her.

The September moon was up and shining clearly over
garden, lawn, and sea, when the sound of voices called her
down. At the stair-foot she paused with a disappointed
air, for only one hat lay on the hall table, and a glance
showed her only one guest with Mark and Prue. She
strolled irresolutely through the breezy hall, looked out at
either open door, sung a little to herself, but broke off in
the middle of a line, and, as if following a sudden impulse,
went out into the mellow moonlight, forgetful of uncovered[105]
head or dewy damage to the white hem of her gown.
Half way down the avenue she paused before a shady nook,
and looked in. The evergreens that enclosed it made the
seat doubly dark to eyes inured to the outer light, and seeing
a familiar seeming figure sitting with its head upon its
hand, Sylvia leaned in, saying, with a daughterly caress       

"Why, what is my romantic father doing here?"

The sense of touch was quicker than that of sight, and
with an exclamation of surprise she had drawn back before
Warwick replied       

"It is not the old man, but the young one, who is romancing
here."

"I beg your pardon! We have been waiting for you;
what thought is so charming that you forgot us all?"

Sylvia was a little startled, else she would scarcely have
asked so plain a question. But Warwick often asked much
blunter ones, always told the naked truth without prevarication
or delay, and straightway answered       

"The thought of the woman whom I hope to make my
wife."

Sylvia stood silent for a moment as if intent on fastening
in her hair the delicate spray of hop-bells just gathered
from the vine that formed a leafy frame for the graceful
picture which she made standing, with uplifted arms, behind
the arch. When she spoke it was to say, as she
moved on toward the house       

"It is too beautiful a night to stay in doors, but Prue is
waiting for me, and Mark wants to plan with you about
our ride to-morrow. Shall we go together?"

She beckoned, and he came out of the shadow showing
her an expression which she had never seen before. His
face was flushed, his eye unquiet, his manner eager yet[106]
restrained. She had seen him intellectually excited many
times; never emotionally till now. Something wayward,
yet warm, in this new mood attracted her, because so like
her own. But with a tact as native as her sympathy she
showed no sign of this, except in the attentive look she
fixed upon him as the moonlight bathed him in its splendor.
He met the glance, seemed to interpret it aright, but
did not answer its unconscious inquiry; for pausing, he
asked abruptly       

"Should a rash promise be considered binding when it
threatens to destroy one's peace?"

Sylvia pondered an instant before she answered slowly       

"If the promise was freely given, no sin committed in its
keeping, and no peace troubled but one's own, I should say
yes."

Still pausing, he looked down at her with that unquiet
glance as she looked up with her steady one, and with the
same anxiety he asked       

"Would you keep such a promise inviolate, even though
it might cost you the sacrifice of something dearer to you
than your life?"

She thought again, and again looked up, answering with
the sincerity that he had taught her       

"It might be unwise, but if the sacrifice was not one of
principle or something that I ought to love more than life,
I think I should keep the promise as religiously as an
Indian keeps a vow of vengeance."

As she spoke, some recollection seemed to strike Warwick
like a sudden stab. The flush died out of his face, the fire
from his eyes, and an almost grim composure fell upon him
as he said low to himself, with a forward step as if eager
to leave some pain behind him[107]       

"It is better so; for his sake I will leave all to time."

Sylvia saw his lips move, but caught no sound till he
said with a gravity that was almost gloom       

"I think you would; therefore, beware how you bind
yourself with such verbal bonds. Let us go in."

They went; Warwick to the drawing-room, but Sylvia
ran up stairs for the Berlin wools, which in spite of heat
and the sure staining of fingers were to be wound that
night according to contract, for she kept a small promise
as sacredly as she would have done a greater one.

"What have you been doing to give yourself such an
uplifted expression, Sylvia?" said Mark, as she came in.

"Feasting my eyes on lovely colors. Does not that look
like a folded rainbow?" she answered, laying her brilliant
burden on the table where Warwick sat examining a broken
reel, and Prue was absorbed in getting a carriage blanket
under way.

"Come, Sylvia, I shall soon be ready for the first shade,"
she said, clashing her formidable needles. "Is that past
mending, Mr. Warwick?"

"Yes, without better tools than a knife, two pins, and a
bodkin."

"Then you must put the skeins on a chair, Sylvia. Try
not to tangle them, and spread your handkerchief in your
lap, for that maroon color will stain sadly. Now don't
speak to me, for I must count my stitches."

Sylvia began to wind the wools with a swift dexterity as
natural to her hands as certain little graces of gesture
which made their motions pleasant to watch. Warwick
never rummaged work-baskets, gossipped, or paid compliments
for want of something to do. If no little task appeared
for them, he kept his hands out of mischief, and if noth[108]ing
occurred to make words agreeable or necessary, he
proved that he understood the art of silence, and sat with
those vigilant eyes of his fixed upon whatever object attracted
them. Just then the object was a bright band slipping
round the chair-back, with a rapidity that soon produced a
snarl, but no help till patient fingers had smoothed and
wound it up. Then, with the look of one who says to himself,
"I will!" he turned, planted himself squarely before
Sylvia, and held out his hands.

"Here is a reel that will neither tangle nor break your
skeins, will you use it?"

"Yes, thank you, and in return I'll wind your color first."

"Which is my color?"

"This fine scarlet, strong, enduring, and martial, like
yourself."

"You are right."

"I thought so; Mr. Moor prefers blue, and I violet."

"Blue and red make violet," called Mark from his corner,
catching the word "color," though busy with a sketch for a
certain fair Jessie Hope.

Moor was with Mr. Yule in his study, Prue mentally
wrapped in her blanket, and when Sylvia was drawn into
an artistic controversy with her brother, Warwick fell into
deep thought.

      



      


With the pride of a proud man once deceived, he had
barred his heart against womankind, resolving that no second
defeat should oppress him with that distrust of self and
others, which is harder for a generous nature to bear, than
the pain of its own wound. He had yet to learn that the
shadow of love suggests its light, and that they who have
been cheated of the food, without which none can truly live,
long for it with redoubled hunger. Of late he had been
[109]discovering this, for a craving, stronger than his own strong
will, possessed him. He tried to disbelieve and silence it;
attacked it with reason, starved it with neglect, and chilled it
with contempt. But when he fancied it was dead, the longing
rose again, and with a clamorous cry, undid his work. For
the first time, this free spirit felt the master's hand, confessed
a need its own power could not supply, and saw that
no man can live alone on even the highest aspirations without
suffering for the vital warmth of the affections. A
month ago he would have disdained the hope that now was
so dear to him. But imperceptibly the influences of domestic
life had tamed and won him. Solitude looked barren,
vagrancy had lost its charm; his life seemed cold and bare,
for, though devoted to noble aims, it was wanting in the
social sacrifices, cares, and joys, that foster charity, and
sweeten character. An impetuous desire to enjoy the rich
experience which did so much for others, came over him to-night
as it had often done while sharing the delights of this
home, where he had made so long a pause. But with the
desire came a memory that restrained him better than his
promise. He saw what others had not yet discovered, and
obeying the code of honor which governs a true gentleman,
loved his friend better than himself and held his
peace.

The last skein came, and as she wound it, Sylvia's glance
involuntarily rose from the strong hands to the face above
them, and lingered there, for the penetrating gaze was averted,
and an unwonted mildness inspired confidence as its
usual expression of power commanded respect. His silence
troubled her, and with curious yet respectful scrutiny, she
studied his face as she had never done before. She found
it full of a noble gravity and kindliness; candor and cour[110]age
spoke in the lines of the mouth, benevolence and intellect
in the broad arch of the forehead, ardor and energy in
the fire of the eye, and on every lineament the stamp of that
genuine manhood, which no art can counterfeit. Intent
upon discovering the secret of the mastery he exerted over
all who approached him, Sylvia had quite forgotten herself,
when suddenly Warwick's eyes were fixed full upon her own.
What spell lay in them she could not tell, for human eye
had never shed such sudden summer over her. Admiration
was not in it, for it did not agitate; nor audacity, for it did
not abash; but something that thrilled warm through blood
and nerves, that filled her with a glad submission to some
power, absolute yet tender, and caused her to turn her innocent
face freely to his gaze, letting him read therein a
sentiment for which she had not yet found a name.

It lasted but a moment; yet in that moment, each saw
the other's heart, and each turned a new page in the romance
of their lives. Sylvia's eyes fell first, but no blush
followed, no sign of anger or perplexity, only a thoughtful
silence, which continued till the last violet thread dropped
from his hands, and she said almost regretfully       

"This is the end."

"Yes, this is the end."

As he echoed the words Warwick rose suddenly and went
to talk with Mark, whose sketch was done. Sylvia sat a
moment as if quite forgetful where she was, so absorbing
was some thought or emotion. Presently she seemed to
glow and kindle with an inward fire; over face and forehead
rushed an impetuous color, her eyes shone, and her lips
trembled with the fluttering of her breath. Then a panic
appeared to seize her, for, stealing noiselessly away, she
hurried to her room, and covering up her face as if to hide[111]
it even from herself, whispered to that full heart of hers,
with quick coming tears that belied the words       

"Now I know why I am happy!"

How long she lay there weeping and smiling in the moonlight
she never knew. Her sister's call broke in upon the
first love dream she had ever woven for herself, and she
went down to bid the friends good night. The hall was
only lighted by the moon, and in the dimness of the shadow
where she stood, no one saw traces of that midsummer
shower on her cheeks, or detected the soft trouble in her
eye, but for the first time Moor felt her hand tremble in
his own and welcomed the propitious omen.

Being an old-fashioned gentleman, Mr. Yule preserved in
his family the pleasant custom of hand-shaking, which
gives such heartiness to the morning and evening greetings
of a household. Moor liked and adopted it; Warwick
had never done so, but that night he gave a hand to Prue
and Mark with his most cordial expression, and Sylvia felt
both her own taken in a warm lingering grasp, although he
only said "good by!" Then they went; but while the
three paused at the door held by the beauty of the night,
back to them on the wings of the wind came Warwick's
voice singing the song that Sylvia loved. All down the
avenue, and far along the winding road they traced his progress,
till the strain died in the distance leaving only the
echo of the song to link them to the singer.

When evening came again Sylvia waited on the lawn
to have the meeting over in the dark, for love made her
very shy. But Moor came alone, and his first words were,

"Comfort me, Sylvia, Adam is gone. He went as unexpectedly
as he came, and when I woke this morning a
note lay at my door, but my friend was not there."[112]

She murmured some stereotyped regret, but there was a
sharp pain at her heart till there came to her the remembrance
of Warwick's question, uttered on the spot where she
was standing. Some solace she must have, and clinging to
this one thought hopefully within herself       

"He has made some promise, has gone to get released
from it, and will come back to say what he looked last
night. He is so true I will believe in him and wait."

She did wait, but week after week went by and Warwick
did not come.




CHAPTER VII.

DULL BUT NECESSARY.


Whoever cares only for incident and action in a book[113]
had better skip this chapter and read on; but those who
take an interest in the delineation of character will find the
key to Sylvia's here.

John Yule might have been a poet, painter, or philanthropist,
for Heaven had endowed him with fine gifts; he was a
prosperous merchant with no ambition but to leave a fortune
to his children and live down the memory of a bitter past.
On the threshold of his life he stumbled and fell; for as
he paused there, waiting for the first step to appear, Providence
tested and found him wanting. On one side, Poverty
offered the aspiring youth her meagre hand; but he was not
wise enough to see the virtues hidden under her hard
aspect, nor brave enough to learn the stern yet salutary
lessons which labor, necessity, and patience teach, giving to
those who serve and suffer the true success. On the other
hand Opulence allured him with her many baits, and, silencing
the voice of conscience, he yielded to temptation and
wrecked his nobler self.

A loveless marriage was the price he paid for his ambition;
not a costly one, he thought, till time taught him that
whosoever mars the integrity of his own soul by transgressing
the great laws of life, even by so much as a hair's[114]
breadth, entails upon himself and heirs the inevitable
retribution which proves their worth and keeps them sacred.
The tie that bound and burdened the unhappy twain, worn
thin by constant friction, snapped at last, and in the solemn
pause death made in his busy life, there rose before him
those two ghosts who sooner or later haunt us all, saying
with reproachful voices,       "This I might have been," and
"This I am." Then he saw the failure of his life. At
fifty he found himself poorer than when he made his momentous
choice; for the years that had given him wealth,
position, children, had also taken from him youth, self-respect,
and many a gift whose worth was magnified by loss.
He endeavored to repair the fault so tardily acknowledged,
but found it impossible to cancel it when remorse, embittered
effort, and age left him powerless to redeem the rich inheritance
squandered in his prime.

If ever man received punishment for a self-inflicted
wrong it was John Yule. A punishment as subtle as the
sin; for in the children growing up about him every relinquished
hope, neglected gift, lost aspiration, seemed to live
again; yet on each and all was set the direful stamp of
imperfection, which made them visible illustrations of the
great law broken in his youth.

In Prudence, as she grew to womanhood, he saw his own
practical tact and talent, nothing more. She seemed the
living representative of the years spent in strife for profit,
power, and place; the petty cares that fret the soul, the
mercenary schemes that waste a life, the worldly formalities,
frivolities, and fears, that so belittle character. All these
he saw in this daughter's shape; and with pathetic patience
bore the daily trial of an over active, over anxious, affectionate
but most prosaic child.[115]

In Mark he saw his ardor for the beautiful, his love of
the poetic, his reverence for genius, virtue, heroism. But
here too the subtle blight had fallen. This son, though
strong in purpose was feeble in performance; for some
hidden spring of power was wanting, and the shadow of
that earlier defeat chilled in his nature the energy which is
the first attribute of all success. Mark loved poetry, and
"wrote in numbers for the numbers came;" but, whether
tragic, tender, or devout, in each attempt there was enough
of the divine fire to warm them into life, yet not enough to
gift them with the fervor that can make a line immortal,
and every song was a sweet lament for the loftier lays that
might have been. He loved art and gave himself to it;
but though studying all forms of beauty he never reached
its soul, and every effort tantalized him with fresh glimpses
of the fair ideal which he could not reach. He loved the
true, but high thoughts seldom blossomed into noble deeds;
for when the hour came the man was never ready, and disappointment
was his daily portion. A sad fate for the son,
a far sadder one for the father who had bequeathed it to
him from the irrecoverable past.

In Sylvia he saw, mysteriously blended, the two natures
that had given her life, although she was born when the
gulf between regretful husband and sad wife was widest.
As if indignant Nature rebelled against the outrage done
her holiest ties, adverse temperaments gifted the child with
the good and ill of each. From her father she received
pride, intellect, and will; from her mother passion, imagination,
and the fateful melancholy of a woman defrauded
of her dearest hope. These conflicting temperaments, with
all their aspirations, attributes, and inconsistencies, were
woven into a nature fair and faulty; ambitious, yet not[116]
self-reliant; sensitive, yet not keen-sighted. These two
masters ruled soul and body, warring against each other,
making Sylvia an enigma to herself and her life a train of
moods.

A wise and tender mother would have divined her nameless
needs, answered her vague desires, and through the
medium of the most omnipotent affection given to humanity,
have made her what she might have been. But Sylvia had
never known mother-love, for her life came through death;
and the only legacy bequeathed her was a slight hold upon
existence, a ceaseless craving for affection, and the shadow
of a tragedy that wrung from the pale lips, that grew cold
against her baby cheek, the cry, "Free at last, thank God
for that!"

Prudence could not fill the empty place, though the
good-hearted housewife did her best. Neither sister understood
the other, and each tormented the other through her
very love. Prue unconsciously exasperated Sylvia, Sylvia
unconsciously shocked Prue, and they hitched along together
each trying to do well and each taking diametrically opposite
measures to effect her purpose. Mark briefly but
truly described them when he said, "Sylvia trims the
house with flowers, but Prudence dogs her with a dust-pan."

Mr. Yule was now a studious, melancholy man, who,
having said one fatal "No" to himself, made it the satisfaction
of his life to say a never varying "Yes" to his
children. But though he left no wish of theirs ungratified,
he seemed to have forfeited his power to draw and hold
them to himself. He was more like an unobtrusive guest
than a master in his house. His children loved, but never
clung to him, because unseen, yet impassible, rose the bar[117]rier
of an instinctive protest against the wrong done their
dead mother, unconscious on their part but terribly significant
to him.

Mark had been years away; and though the brother and
sister were tenderly attached, sex, tastes, and pursuits kept
them too far apart, and Sylvia was solitary even in this
social seeming home. Dissatisfied with herself, she endeavored
to make her life what it should be with the energy
of an ardent, aspiring nature; and through all experiences,
sweet or bitter, all varying moods, successes and defeats, a
sincere desire for happiness the best and highest, was
the little rushlight of her soul that never wavered or went
out.

She never had known friendship in its truest sense, for
next to love it is the most abused of words. She had
called many "friend," but was still ignorant of that sentiment,
cooler than passion, warmer than respect, more just
and generous than either, which recognizes a kindred spirit
in another, and claiming its right, keeps it sacred by the
wise reserve that is to friendship what the purple bloom is
to the grape, a charm which once destroyed can never be
restored. Love she had desired, yet dreaded, knowing her
own passionate nature, and when it came to her, making
that brief holiday the fateful point of her life, she gave
herself to it wholly. Before that time she had rejoiced
over a more tranquil pleasure, and believed that she had
found her friend in the neighbor who after long absence
had returned to his old place.

Nature had done much for Geoffrey Moor, but the wise
mother also gave him those teachers to whose hard lessons
she often leaves her dearest children. Five years spent in
the service of a sister, who, through the sharp discipline of[118]
pain was fitting her meek soul for heaven, had given him an
experience such as few young men receive. This fraternal
devotion proved a blessing in disguise; it preserved him
from any profanation of his youth, and the companionship
of the helpless creature whom he loved had proved an
ever present stimulant to all that was best and sweetest in
the man. A single duty faithfully performed had set the
seal of integrity upon his character, and given him grace to
see at thirty the rich compensation he had received for the
ambitions silently sacrificed at twenty-five. When his
long vigil was over he looked into the world to find his place
again. But the old desires were dead, the old allurements
had lost their charm, and while he waited for time to show
him what good work he should espouse, no longing was so
strong as that for a home, where he might bless and be
blessed in writing that immortal poem a virtuous and
happy life.

Sylvia soon felt the power and beauty of this nature,
and remembering how well he had ministered to a physical
affliction, often looked into the face whose serenity was a
perpetual rebuke, longing to ask him to help and heal the
mental ills that perplexed and burdened her. Moor soon
divined the real isolation of the girl, read the language of
her wistful eyes, felt that he could serve her, and invited
confidence by the cordial alacrity with which he met her
least advance.

But while he served he learned to love her, for Sylvia,
humble in her own conceit, and guarded by the secret passion
that possessed her, freely showed the regard she felt,
with no thought of misapprehension, no fear of consequences.
Unconscious that such impulsive demonstration
made her only more attractive, that every manifestation of[119]
her frank esteem was cherished in her friend's heart of
hearts, and that through her he was enjoying the blossom
time of life. So peacefully and pleasantly the summer
ripened into autumn and Sylvia's interest into an enduring
friendship.




CHAPTER VIII.

NO.


Drawn curtains shut out the frosty night, the first fire[120]
of the season burned upon the hearth, and basking in its
glow sat Sylvia, letting her thoughts wander where they
would. As books most freely open at pages oftenest read,
the romance of her summer life seldom failed to unclose at
passages where Warwick's name appeared. Pleasant as
were many hours of that time, none seemed so full of
beauty as those passed with him, and sweetest of them all
the twilight journey hand in hand. It now returned to
her so freshly that she seemed to hear again the evening
sounds, to feel the warm, fern-scented wind blow over her,
to see the strong hand offered helpfully, and with an impulse
past control she stretched her own to that visionary
Warwick as the longing of her heart found vent in an
eager

"Come!"

"I am here."

A voice replied, a hand pressed hers, and springing up
she saw, not Adam, but Moor, standing beside her with a
beaming face. Concealing the thrill of joy, the pang of
pain he had brought her, she greeted him cordially, and
reseating herself, instinctively tried to turn the current of
her thoughts.

      



      


"I am glad you came, for I have built castles in the air[121]
long enough, and you will give me more substantial entertainment,
as you always do."

The broken dream had left tokens of its presence in the
unwonted warmth of Sylvia's manner; Moor felt it, and
for a moment did not answer. Much of her former shyness
had crept over her of late; she sometimes shunned him,
was less free in conversation, less frank in demonstration,
and once or twice had colored deeply as she caught his eye
upon her. These betrayals of Warwick's image in her
thoughts seemed to Moor the happy omens he had waited
eagerly to see, and each day his hope grew more assured.
He had watched her unseen while she was busied with her
mental pastime, and as he looked his heart had grown unspeakably
tender, for never had her power over him been
so fully felt, and never had he so longed to claim her in
the name of his exceeding love. A pleasant peace reigned
through the house, the girl sat waiting at his side, the moment
looked auspicious, the desire grew irresistible, and he
yielded to it.

"You are thinking of something new and pleasant to tell
me, I hope,       something in keeping with this quiet place
and hour," said Sylvia, glancing up at him with the traitorous
softness still in her eyes.

"Yes, and hoping you would like it."

"Then I have never heard it before?"

"Never from me."

"Go on, please; I am ready."

She folded her hands together on her knee, turned her
face attentively to his, and unwittingly composed herself to
listen to the sweet story so often told, and yet so hard to
tell. Moor meant to woo her very gently, for he believed[122]
that love was new to her. He had planned many graceful
illustrations for his tale, and rounded many smoothly-flowing
sentences in which to unfold it. But the emotions are
not well bred, and when the moment came nature conquered
art. No demonstration seemed beautiful enough to
grace the betrayal of his passion, no language eloquent
enough to tell it, no power strong enough to hold in check
the impulse that mastered him. He went to her, knelt
down upon the cushion at her feet, and lifting to her a face
flushed and fervent with the ardor of a man's first love,
said impetuously       

"Sylvia, read it here!"

There was no need for her to look; act, touch, and tone
told the story better than the most impassioned speech.
The supplication of his attitude, the eager beating of his
heart, the tender pressure of his hand, dispelled her blindness
in the drawing of a breath, and showed her what she
had done. Now neglected warnings, selfish forgetfulness,
and the knowledge of an unconscious but irremediable
wrong frightened and bewildered her; she hid her face
and shrunk back trembling with remorse and shame.
Moor, seeing in her agitation only maiden happiness or
hesitancy, accepted and enjoyed a blissful moment while
he waited her reply. It was so long in coming that he
gently tried to draw her hands away and look into her
face, whispering like one scarcely doubtful of assent       

"You love me, Sylvia?"

"No."

Only half audible was the reluctant answer, yet he
heard it, smiled at what he fancied a shy falsehood, and
said tenderly       

"Will you let me love you, dear?"[123]

"No."

Fainter than before was the one word, but it reached and
startled him. Hurriedly he asked       

"Am I nothing to you but a friend?"

"No."

With a quick gesture he put down her hands and looked
at her. Grief, regret, and pity, filled her face with trouble,
but no love was there. He saw, yet would not believe the
truth, felt that the sweet certainty of love had gone, yet
could not relinquish the fond hope.

"Sylvia, do you understand me?"

"I do, I do! but I cannot say what you would have me,
and I must tell the truth, although it breaks my heart.
Geoffrey, I do not love you."

"Can I not teach you?" he pleaded eagerly.

"I have no desire to learn."

Softly she spoke, remorseful she looked, but the words
wounded like a blow. All the glad assurance died, the
passionate glow faded, the caress, half tender, half timid,
fell away, and nothing of the happy lover remained in face
or figure. He rose slowly as if the heavy disappointment
oppressed both soul and body. He fixed on her a glance of
mingled incredulity, reproach, and pain, and said, like one
bent on ending suspense at once       

"Did you not see that I loved you? Can you have been
trifling with me? Sylvia, I thought you too simple and
sincere for heartless coquetry."

"I am! You shall not suspect me of that, though I deserve
all other reproaches. I have been very selfish, very
blind. I should have remembered that in your great kindness
you might like me too well for your own peace. I
should have believed Mark, and been less candid in my[124]
expressions of esteem. But I wanted a friend so much; I
found all I could ask in you; I thought my youth, my
faults, my follies, would make it impossible for you to see
in me anything but a wayward girl, who frankly showed
her regard, and was proud of yours. It was one of my sad
mistakes; I see it now; and now it is too late for anything
but penitence. Forgive me if you can; I've taken all the
pleasure, and left you all the pain."

Sylvia spoke in a paroxysm of remorseful sorrow. Moor
listened with a sinking heart, and when she dropped her
face into her hands again, unable to endure the pale expectancy
of his, he turned away, saying with an accent of
quiet despair       

"Then I have worked and waited all this summer to see
my harvest fail at last. Oh, Sylvia, I so loved, so trusted
you."

He leaned his arm on the low chimney piece, laid down
his head upon it and stood silent, trying to forgive.

It is always a hard moment for any woman, when it demands
her bravest sincerity to look into a countenance of
eager love, and change it to one of bitter disappointment by
the utterance of a monosyllable. To Sylvia it was doubly
hard, for now her blindness seemed as incredible as cruel;
her past frankness unjustifiable; her pleasure selfish; her
refusal the blackest ingratitude, and her dream of friendship
forever marred. In the brief pause that fell, every
little service he had rendered her, rose freshly in her memory;
every hour of real content and genuine worth that he
had given her, seemed to come back and reproach her;
every look, accent, action, of both happy past and sad present
seemed to plead for him. Her conscience cried out
against her, her heart overflowed with penitence and pity.[125]
She looked at him, longing to say something, do something
that should prove her repentance, and assure him of the affection
which she felt. As she looked, two great tears fell
glittering to the hearth, and lay there such eloquent reproaches,
that, had Sylvia's heart been hard and cold as
the marble where they shone, it would have melted then.
She could not bear it, she went to him, took in both her
own the rejected hand that hung at his side, and feeling
that no act could too tenderly express her sorrow, lifted it
to her lips and softly kissed it.

An instant she was permitted to lay her cheek against it
as a penitent child mutely imploring pardon might have
done. Then it broke from her hold, and gathering her to
himself, Moor looked up exclaiming with renewed hope, unaltered
longing       

"You do care for me, then? You give yourself to me in
spite of that hard No? Ah, Sylvia, you are capricious
even in your love."

She could not answer, for if that first No had been hard
to utter, this was impossible. It seemed like turning the
knife in the wound, to disappoint the hope that had gathered
strength from despair, and she could only lay her head
down on his breast, weeping the saddest tears she had ever
shed. Still happy in his new delusion, Moor softly stroked
the shining hair, smiling so tenderly, so delightedly, that
it was well for her she did not see the smile, the words were
enough.

"Dear Sylvia, I have tried so hard to make you love me,
how could you help it?"

The reason sprung to her lips, but maiden pride and
shame withheld it. What could she tell except that she
had cherished a passion, based only on a look. She had[126]
deceived herself in her belief that Moor was but a friend,
might she not also have deceived herself in believing Warwick
was a lover? She could not own this secret, its betrayal
could not alter her reply, nor heal Moor's wound,
but the thought of Warwick strengthened her. It always
did, as surely as the influence of his friend always soothed
her, for one was an embodiment of power, the other of tenderness.

"Geoffrey, let me be true to you and to myself," she
said, so earnestly that it gave weight to her broken words.
"I cannot be your wife, but I can be your dear friend forever.
Try to believe this,       make my task easier by giving
up your hope,       and oh, be sure that while I live I cannot
do enough to show my sorrow for the great wrong I have
done you."

"Must it be so? I find it very hard to accept the truth
and give up the hope that has made my happiness so long.
Let me keep it, Sylvia; let me wait and work again. I
have a firm belief that you will love me yet, because I
cleave to you with heart and soul, long for you continually,
and think you the one woman of the world."

"Ah, if it were only possible!" she sighed.

"Let me make it so! In truth, I think I should not
labor long. You are so young, dear, you have not learned
to know your own heart yet. It was not pity nor penitence
alone that brought you here to comfort me. Was it,
Sylvia?"

"Yes. Had it been love, could I stand as I am now and
not show it?"

She looked up at him, showed him that though her cheeks
were wet there was no rosy dawn of passion there; though
her eyes were as full of affection as of grief, there was no[127]
shy avoidance of his own, no dropping of the lids, lest they
should tell too much; and though his arm encircled her,
she did not cling to him as loving women cling when they
lean on the strength which, touched by love, can both
cherish and sustain. That look convinced him better than
a flood of words. A long sigh broke from his lips, and,
turning from her the eyes that had so wistfully searched
and found not, they went wandering drearily hither and
thither as if seeking the hope whose loss made life seem
desolate. Sylvia saw it, groaned within herself, but still
held fast to the hard truth, and tried to make it kinder.

"Geoffrey, I once heard you say to Mark, 'Friendship
is the best college character can graduate from. Believe in
it, seek for it, and when it comes keep it as sacredly as
love.' All my life I have wanted a friend, have looked for
one, and when he came I welcomed him. May I not keep
him, and preserve the friendship dear and sacred still, although
I cannot offer love?"

Softly, seriously, she spoke, but the words sounded cold
to him; friendship seemed so poor now, love so rich, he
could not leave the blessed sunshine which transfigured the
whole earth and sit down in the little circle of a kindly
fire without keen regret.

"I should say yes, I will try to do it if nothing easier
remains to me. Sylvia, for five years I have longed and
waited for a home. Duty forbade it then, because poor
Marion had only me to make her sad life happy, and my
mother left her to my charge. Now the duty is ended, the
old house very empty, my heart very hungry for affection.
You are all in all to me, and I find it so difficult to relinquish
my dream that I must be importunate. I have
spoken too soon, you have had no time to think, to look in[128]to
yourself and question your own heart. Go, now, recall
what I have said, remember that I will wait for you
patiently, and when I leave, an hour hence, come down and
give me my last answer."

Sylvia was about to speak, but the sound of an approaching
step brought over her the shyness she had not felt before,
and without a word she darted from the room. Then romance
also fled, for Prue came bustling in, and Moor was
called to talk of influenzas, while his thoughts were full of
love.

Alone in her chamber Sylvia searched herself. She pictured
the life that would be hers with Moor. The old
house so full of something better than its opulence, an
atmosphere of genial tranquillity which made it home-like
to whoever crossed its threshold. Herself the daily companion
and dear wife of the master who diffused such
sunshine there; whose serenity soothed her restlessness;
whose affection would be as enduring as his patience; whose
character she so truly honored. She felt that no woman
need ask a happier home, a truer or more tender lover.
But when she looked into herself she found the cordial, unimpassioned
sentiment he first inspired still unchanged, and
her heart answered       

"This is friendship."

She thought of Warwick, and the other home that might
be hers. Fancy painted in glowing colors the stirring life,
the novelty, excitement, and ever new delight such wanderings
would have for her. The joy of being always with
him; the proud consciousness that she was nearest and
dearest to such a man; the certainty that she might share
the knowledge of his past, might enjoy his present, help to
shape his future. There was no time to look into her heart,[129]
for up sprung its warm blood to her cheek, its hope to her
eye, its longing to her lips, its answer glad and ready       

"Ah, this is love!"

The clock struck ten, and after lingering a little Sylvia
went down. Slowly, because her errand was a hard one;
thoughtfully, because she knew not where nor how she could
best deliver it. No need to look for him or linger for his
coming; he was already there. Alone in the hall, absently
smoothing a little silken shawl she often wore, and waiting
with a melancholy patience that smote her to the heart.
He went to meet her, took both her hands in his, and looked
into her face so tenderly, so wistfully!       

"Sylvia, is it good night or good by?"

Her eyes filled, her hands trembled, her color paled, but
she answered steadily       

"Forgive me; it is good by."




CHAPTER IX.

HOLLY.


"Another gift for you, Sylvia. I don't know the writing,[130]
but it smells like flowers," said Mark, as a smiling maid
brought in a package on Christmas morning.

Sylvia tore off the wrapper, lifted a cover, and exclaimed
with pleasure, though it was the simplest present she had
received that day. Only an osier basket, graceful in design
and shape, lined with moss, and filled with holly sprays,
the scarlet berries glowing beautifully among the polished
green. No note, no card, no hint of its donor anywhere
appeared, for none of them recognized the boldly written
address. Presently a thought came to Sylvia; in a moment
the mystery seemed to grow delightfully clear, and
she said to herself with a glow of joy, "This is so like
Adam I know he sent it."

"I must say it is the most peculiar present I ever saw,
and it is my belief that the boy who brought it stole whatever
article of value it contained, for it was very carelessly
done up. No person in their senses would send a few
sprigs of common holly to a young lady in this odd way,"
said Prue, poking here and there in hopes of finding some
clue.

"It is not common, but very beautiful; we seldom see[131]
any so large and green, and full of berries. Nor is it odd,
but very kind, because from the worn look of the wrapper
I know it has been sent a long way to please me. Look at
the little ferns in the moss, and smell the sweet moist odor
that seems to take us into summer woods in spite of a snowstorm.
Ah, he knew what I should like."

"Who knew?" asked Mark, quickly.

"You must guess." And fearing that she had betrayed
herself, Sylvia hurried across the room to put the holly in
water.

"Ah, ha, I see," said Mark, laughing.

"Who is it?" asked Prue, looking mystified.

"Geoffrey," whispered Mr. Yule, with an air of satisfaction.

Then all three looked at one another, all three nodded
sagely, and all three glanced at the small person bending
over the table with cheeks almost as rosy as the berries in
her hand.

Every one knows what a Christmas party is when a general
friendliness pervades the air, and good wishes fly about
like confetti during Carnival. To such an one went Sylvia
and Mark that night, the brother looking unusually blithe
and debonair, because the beloved Jessie had promised to be
there if certain aunts and uncles would go away in time;
the sister in a costume as pretty as appropriate, for snow
and holly made her a perfect Yule. Sylvia loved dancing,
and knew "wall flowers" only by sight; therefore she was
busy; her lover's gift shone greenly in bosom, hair, and
fleecy skirts; therefore she was beautiful, and the thought
that Adam had not forgotten her lay warm at her heart;
therefore she was supremely happy. Mark was devoted,
but disappointed, for Jessie did not come, and having[132]
doomed the detaining aunts and uncles to a most unblessed
fate, he sought consolation among less fair damsels.

"Now go and enjoy yourself. I shall dance no more
round dances, for I'd rather not with any one but you, and
you have been a martyr long enough."

Mark roamed away, and finding a cool corner Sylvia watched
the animated scene before her till her wandering glance was
arrested by the sight of a new comer, and her mind busied
with trying to recollect where she had seen him. The
slender figure, swarthy face, and vivacious eyes all seemed
familiar, but she could find no name for their possessor till
he caught her eye, when he half bowed and wholly smiled.
Then she remembered, and while still recalling that brief
interview one of their young hosts appeared with the
stranger, and Gabriel André was duly presented.

"I could hardly expect to be remembered, and am much
flattered, I assure you. Did you suffer from the shower
that day, Miss Yule?"

The speech was nothing, but the foreign accent gave a
softness to the words, and the southern grace of manner
gave an air of romance to the handsome youth. Sylvia
was in the mood to be pleased with everybody, everything,
and was unusually gracious as they merrily pursued the
subject suggested by his question. Presently he asked       

"Is Warwick with you now?"

"He was not staying with us, but with his friend, Mr.
Moor."

"He was the gentleman who pulled so well that day?"

"Yes."

"Is Warwick with him still?"

"Oh, no, he went away three months ago."

"I wonder where!"[133]

"So do I!"

The wish had been impulsively expressed, and was as
impulsively echoed. Young André smiled, and liked Miss
Yule the better for forgetting that somewhat lofty air of
hers.

"You have no conjecture, then? I wish to find him,
much, very much, but cannot put myself upon his trail.
He is so what you call peculiar that he writes no letters,
leaves no address, and roves here and there like a born
gitano."

"Have you ill news for him?"

"I have the best a man could desire; but fear that while
I look for him he has gone to make a disappointment for
himself. You are a friend, I think?"

"I am."

"Then you know much of him, his life, his ways?"

"Yes, both from himself and Mr. Moor."

"Then you know of his betrothal to my cousin, doubtless,
and I may speak of it, because if you will be so kind
you may perhaps help us to find him."

"I did not know       perhaps he did not wish it       " began
Sylvia, folding one hand tightly in the other, with a
quick breath and a momentary sensation as if some one had
struck her in the face.

"He thinks so little of us I shall not regard his wish
just now. If you will permit me I would say a word for
my cousin's sake, as I know you will be interested for her,
and I do not feel myself strange with you."

Sylvia bowed, and standing before her with an air half
mannish, half boyish, Gabriel went on in the low, rapid
tone peculiar to him.

"See, then, my cousin was betrothed in May. A month[134]
after Adam cries out that he loves too much for his peace,
that he has no freedom of his heart or mind, that he must
go away and take his breath before he is made a happy
slave forever. Ottila told me this. She implored him to
stay; but no, he vows he will not come again till they
marry, in the next June. He thinks it a weakness to adore
a woman. Impertinente! I have no patience for him."

Gabriel spoke indignantly, and pressed his foot into the
carpet with a scornful look. But Sylvia took no heed of
his petulance, she only kept her eyes fixed upon him with
an intentness which he mistook for interest. The eyes
were fine, the interest was flattering, and though quite
aware that he was both taking a liberty and committing a
breach of confidence, the impulsive young gentleman chose
to finish what he had begun, and trust that no harm would
follow.

"He has been gone now more than half a year, but has
sent no letter, no message, nothing to show that he still
lives. Ottila waits, she writes, she grows too anxious to
endure, she comes to look for him. I help her, but we do
not find him yet, and meantime I amuse her. My friends
are kind, and we enjoy much as we look about us for this
truant Adam."

If Sylvia could have doubted the unexpected revelation,
this last trait was so like Warwick it convinced her at once.
Though the belief to which she had clung so long was suddenly
swept from under her, she floated silently with no
outward sign of shipwreck as her hope went down. Pride
was her shield, and crowding back all other emotions she
kept herself unnaturally calm behind it till she was alone.
If Gabriel had been watching her he would only have discovered
that she was a paler blonde than he had thought[135]
her; that her address was more coldly charming than before;
and that her eye no longer met his, but rested
steadily on the folded fan she held. He was not watching
her, however, but glancing frequently over her head at
something at the far end of the rooms which a crowd of
assiduous gentlemen concealed. His eye wandered, but his
thoughts did not; for still intent on the purpose that seemed
to have brought him to her, he said, as if reluctant to be
importunate, yet resolved to satisfy himself       

"Pardon me that I so poorly entertain you, and let me
ask one other question in Ottila's name. This Moor, would
he not give us some clue to Adam's haunts?"

"He is absent, and will be till spring, I think. Where
I do not know, else I could write for you. Did Mr. Warwick
promise to return in June?"

"Yes."

"Then, if he lives, he will come. Your cousin must
wait; it will not be in vain."

"It shall not!"

The young man's voice was stern, and a passionate glitter
made his black eyes fierce. Then the former suavity
returned, and with his most gallant air he said       

"You are kind, Miss Yule; I thank you, and put away
this so troublesome affair. May I have the honor?"

If he had proposed to waltz over a precipice Sylvia felt
as if she could have accepted, provided there was time to
ask a question or two before the crash came. A moment
afterward Mark was surprised to see her floating round the
room on the arm of "the olive-colored party," whom he
recognized at once. His surprise soon changed to pleasure,
for his beauty-loving eye as well as his brotherly pride was
gratified as the whirling couples subsided and the young[136]
pair went circling slowly by, giving to the graceful pastime
the enchantment few have skill to lend it, and making it a
spectacle of life-enjoying youth to be remembered by the
lookers on.

"Thank you! I have not enjoyed such a waltz since I
left Cuba. It is the rudest of rude things to say, but to
you I may confide it, because you dance like a Spaniard.
The ladies here seem to me as cold as their own snow, and
they make dancing a duty, not a pleasure. They should
see Ottila; she is all grace and fire. I could kill myself
dancing with her. Adam used to say it was like wine to
watch her."

"I wish she was here to give us a lesson."

"She is, but will not dance to-night."

"Here!" cried Sylvia, stopping abruptly.

"Why not? Elyott is mad for her, and gave me no
peace till I brought her. She is behind that wall of men;
shall I make a passage for you? She will be glad to talk
with you of Adam, and I to show you the handsomest
woman in Habana."

"Let us wait a little; I should be afraid to talk before
so many. She is very beautiful, then."

"You will laugh and call me extravagant, as others do,
if I say what I think; so I will let you judge for yourself.
See, your brother stands on tiptoe to peep at her. Now
he goes in, and there he will stay. You do not like that,
perhaps. But Ottila cannot help her beauty, nor the power
she has of making all men love her. I wish she could!"

"She is gifted and accomplished, as well as lovely?"
asked Sylvia, glancing at her companion's gloomy face.

"She is everything a woman should be, and I could
shoot Adam for his cruel neglect."[137]

Gabriel's dark face kindled as he spoke, and Sylvia
drearily wished he would remember how ill-bred it was to
tire her with complaints of her friend, and raptures over
his cousin. He seemed to perceive this, turned a little
haughty at her silence, and when he spoke was all the
stranger again.

"This is a contra danza; shall we give the snow-ladies
another lesson? First, may I do myself the pleasure of
getting you an ice?"

"A glass of water, please; I am cool enough without
more ice."

He seated her and went upon his errand. She was cool
now; weary-footed, sick at heart, and yearning to be alone.
But in these days women do not tear their hair and make
scenes, though their hearts may ache and burn with the
same sharp suffering as of old. Till her brother came she
knew she must bear it, and make no sign. She did bear
it, drank the water with a smile, danced the dance with
spirit, and bore up bravely till Mark appeared. She was
alone just then, and his first words were       

"Have you seen her?"

"No; take me where I can, and tell me what you know
of her."

"Nothing, but that she is André's cousin, and he adores
her, as boys always do a charming woman who is kind to
them. Affect to be admiring these flowers, and look without
her knowing it, or she will frown at you like an insulted
princess, as she did at me."

Sylvia looked, saw the handsomest woman in Havana,
and hated her immediately. It was but natural, for Sylvia
was a very human girl, and Ottila one whom no woman
would love, however much she might admire.[138]

Hers was that type of character which every age has
reproduced, varying externally with climates and conditions,
but materially the same from fabled Circe down to
Lola Montes, or some less famous syren whose subjects are
not kings. The same passions that in ancient days broke
out in heaven-defying crimes; the same power of beauty,
intellect, or subtlety; the same untamable spirit and lack
of moral sentiment are the attributes of all; latent or alert
as the noble or ignoble nature may predominate. Most of
us can recall some glimpse of such specimens of Nature's
work in a daring mood. Many of our own drawing-rooms
have held illustrations of the nobler type, and modern men
and women have quailed before royal eyes whose possessors
ruled all spirits but their own. Born in Athens, and endowed
with a finer intellect, Ottila might have been an
Aspasia; or cast in that great tragedy the French Revolution,
have played a brave part and died heroically like
Roland and Corday. But set down in uneventful times,
the courage, wit, and passion that might have served high
ends dwindled to their baser counterparts, and made her
what she was,       a fair allurement to the eyes of men, a
born rival to the peace of women, a rudderless nature absolute
as fate.

Sylvia possessed no knowledge that could analyze for her
the sentiment which repelled, even while it attracted her
toward Warwick's betrothed. That he loved her she did
not doubt, because she felt that even his pride would yield
to the potent fascination of this woman. As Sylvia looked,
her feminine eye took in every gift of face and figure, every
grace of attitude or gesture, every daintiness of costume,
and found no visible flaw in Ottila, from her haughty head
to her handsome foot. Yet when her scrutiny ended, the[139]
girl felt a sense of disappointment, and no envy mingled
with her admiration.

As she stood, forgetting to assume interest in the camellias
before her, she saw Gabriel join his cousin, saw her
pause and look up at him with an anxious question. He
answered it, glancing toward that part of the room where
she was standing. Ottila's gaze was fixed upon her instantly;
a rapid, but keen survey followed, and then the
lustrous eyes turned away with such supreme indifference,
that Sylvia's blood tingled as if she had received an insult.

"Mark, I am going home," she said, abruptly.

"Very well, I'm ready."

When safe in her own room Sylvia's first act was to take
off the holly wreath, for her head throbbed with a heavy
pain that forbade hope of sleep that night. Looking at the
little chaplet so happily made, she saw that all the berries
had fallen, and nothing but the barbed leaves remained.
A sudden gesture crushed it in both her hands, and standing
so, she gathered many a scattered memory to confirm
that night's discovery.

Warwick had said, with such a tender accent in his voice,
"I thought of the woman I would make my wife." That
was Ottila. He had asked so anxiously, "If one should
keep a promise when it disturbed one's peace?" That was
because he repented of his hasty vow to absent himself till
June. It was not love she saw in his eyes the night they
parted, but pity. He read her secret before that compassionate
glance revealed it to herself, and he had gone away
to spare her further folly. She had deceived herself, had
blindly cherished a baseless hope, and this was the end.
Even for the nameless gift she found a reason, with a woman's
skill, in self-torture. Moor had met Adam, had told[140]
his disappointment, and still pitying her Warwick had sent
the pretty greeting to console her for the loss of both friend
and lover.

This thought seemed to sting her into sudden passion.
As if longing to destroy every trace of her delusion, she
tore away the holly wreaths and flung them in the fire;
took down the bow and arrow Warwick had made her from
above the étagère, where she had arranged the spoils of her
happy voyage, snapped them across her knee and sent them
after the holly; followed by the birch canoe, and every
pebble, moss, shell, or bunch of headed grass he had given
her then. The osier basket was not spared, the box went
next, and even the wrapper was on its way to immolation,
when, as she rent it apart, with a stern pleasure in the
sacrifice it was going to complete, from some close fold of
the paper hitherto undisturbed a card dropped at her feet.

She caught it up and read in handwriting almost as
familiar as her own: "To Sylvia,       A merry Christmas
and best wishes from her friend, Geoffrey Moor." The word
"friend" was underscored, as if he desired to assure her
that he still cherished the only tie permitted him, and sent
the green token to lighten her regret that she could give no
more.

Warm over Sylvia's sore heart rushed the tender thought
and longing, as her tears began to flow. "He cares for
me! he remembered me! I wish he would come back and
comfort me!"




CHAPTER X.

YES.


It is easy to say, "I will forget," but perhaps the hardest[141]
task given us is to lock up a natural yearning of the heart,
and turn a deaf ear to its plaint, for captive and jailer
must inhabit the same small cell. Sylvia was proud, with
that pride which is both sensitive and courageous, which
can not only suffer but wring strength from suffering.
While she struggled with a grief and shame that aged her
with their pain, she asked no help, made no complaint; but
when the forbidden passion stretched its arms to her, she
thrust it back and turned to pleasure for oblivion.

Those who knew her best were troubled and surprised by
the craving for excitement which now took possession of
her, the avidity with which she gratified it, regardless of
time, health, and money. All day she hurried here and
there, driving, shopping, sight-seeing, or entertaining guests
at home. Night brought no cessation of her dissipation,
for when balls, masquerades, and concerts failed, there still
remained the theatre. This soon became both a refuge and
a solace, for believing it to be less harmful than other excitements,
her father indulged her new whim. But, had she
known it, this was the most dangerous pastime she could
have chosen. Calling for no exertion of her own, it left
her free to passively receive a stimulant to her unhappy love[142]
in watching its mimic semblance through all phases of
tragic suffering and sorrow, for she would see no comedies,
and Shakespeare's tragedies became her study.

This lasted for a time, then the reaction came. A black
melancholy fell upon her, and energy deserted soul and
body. She found it a weariness to get up in the morning
and weariness to lie down at night. She no longer cared
even to seem cheerful, owned that she was spiritless, hoped
she should be ill, and did not care if she died to-morrow.
When this dark mood seemed about to become chronic she
began to mend, for youth is wonderfully recuperative, and
the deepest wounds soon heal even against the sufferer's
will. A quiet apathy replaced the gloom, and she let the
tide drift her where it would, hoping nothing, expecting
nothing, asking nothing but that she need not suffer any
more.

She lived fast; all processes with her were rapid; and the
secret experience of that winter taught her many things.
She believed it had only taught her to forget, for now the
outcast love lay very still, and no longer beat despairingly
against the door of her heart, demanding to be taken in
from the cold. She fancied that neglect had killed it, and
that its grave was green with many tears. Alas for Sylvia!
how could she know that it had only sobbed itself to sleep,
and would wake beautiful and strong at the first sound of
its master's voice.

Mark became eventful. In his fitful fashion he had
painted a picture of the Golden Wedding, from sketches
taken at the time. Moor had suggested and bespoken it,
that the young artist might have a motive for finishing it,
because, though he excelled in scenes of that description, he
thought them beneath him, and tempted by more ambitious[143]
designs, neglected his true branch of the art. In April it
was finished, and at his father's request Mark reluctantly
sent it with his Clytemnestra to the annual exhibition. One
morning at breakfast Mr. Yule suddenly laughed out behind
his paper, and with a face of unmixed satisfaction
passed it to his son, pointing to a long critique upon the
Exhibition. Mark prepared himself to receive with becoming
modesty the praises lavished upon his great work, but
was stricken with amazement to find Clytemnestra disposed
of in a single sentence, and the Golden Wedding lauded in
a long enthusiastic paragraph.

"What the deuce does the man mean!" he ejaculated,
staring at his father.

"He means that the work which warms the heart is
greater than that which freezes the blood, I suspect. Moor
knew what you could do and has made you do it, sure that
if you worked for fame unconsciously you should achieve it.
This is a success that I can appreciate, and I congratulate
you heartily, my son."

"Thank you, sir. But upon my word I don't understand
it, and if this wasn't written by the best Art critic
in the country I should feel inclined to say the writer was
a fool. Why that little thing was a daub compared to the
other."

He got no farther in his protest against this unexpected
freak of fortune, for Sylvia seized the paper and read the
paragraph aloud with such happy emphasis amid Prue's
outcries and his father's applause, that Mark began to feel
that he really had done something praiseworthy, and that
the "daub" was not so despicable after all.

"I'm going to look at it from this new point of sight,"
was his sole comment as he went away.[144]

Three hours afterward he appeared to Sylvia as she sat
sewing alone, and startled her with the mysterious announcement.

"I've done it!"

"Done what? Have you burnt poor Clytemnestra?"

"Hang Clytemnestra! I'll begin at the beginning and
prepare you for the grand finale. I went to the Exhibition,
and stared at Father Blake and his family for an hour.
Decided that wasn't bad, though I still admire the other
more. Then people began to come and crowd up, so that I
slipped away for I couldn't stand the compliments. Dahlmann,
Scott, and all the rest of my tribe were there, and,
as true as my name is Mark Yule, every man of them
ignored the Greek party and congratulated me upon the
success of that confounded Golden Wedding."

"My dearest boy, I am so proud! so glad! What is the
matter? Have you been bitten by a tarantula?"

She might well ask, for Mark was dancing all over the
carpet in a most extraordinary style, and only stopped long
enough to throw a little case into Sylvia's lap, asking as a
whole faceful of smiles broke loose       

"What does that mean?"

She opened it, and a suspicious circlet of diamonds appeared,
at sight of which she clapped her hands, and cried
out       

"You're going to ask Jessie to wear it!"

"I have! I have!" sung Mark, dancing more wildly
than ever. Sylvia chased him into a corner and held him
there, almost as much excited as he, while she demanded a
full explanation, which he gave her, laughing like a boy,
and blushing like a girl.

"You have no business to ask, but of course I'm dying[145]
to tell you. I went from that Painter's Purgatory as we
call it, to Mr. Hope's, and asked for Miss Jessie. My angel
came down; I told her of my success, and she smiled as
never a woman did before; I added that I'd only waited to
make myself more worthy of her, by showing that I had
talent, as well as love and money to offer her, and she began
to cry, whereat I took her in my arms and ascended
straight into heaven."

"Please be sober, Mark, and tell me all about it. Was
she glad? Did she say she would? And is everything
as we would have it?"

"It is all perfect, divine, and rapturous, to the last degree.
Jessie has liked me ever since she was born, she
thinks; adores you and Prue for sisters; yearns to call my
parent father; allowed me to say and do whatever I liked;
and gave me a ravishing kiss just there. Sacred spot; I
shall get a mate to it when I put this on her blessed little
finger. Try it for me, I want it to be right, and your hands
are of a size. That fits grandly. When shall I see a joyful
sweetheart doing this on his own behalf, Sylvia?"

"Never!"

She shook off the ring as if it burned her, watching it roll
glittering away, with a somewhat tragical expression. Then
she calmed herself, and sitting down to her work, enjoyed
Mark's raptures for an hour.

The distant city bells were ringing nine that night as a
man paused before Mr. Yule's house, and attentively scrutinized
each window. Many were alight, but on the drawn
curtain of one a woman's shadow came and went. He
watched it a moment, passed up the steps, and noiselessly
went in. The hall was bright and solitary; from above
came the sound of voices, from a room to the right, the stir[146]
of papers and the scratch of a pen, from one on the left, a
steady rustle as of silk, swept slowly to and fro. To the
threshold of this door the man stepped and looked in.

Sylvia was just turning in her walk, and as she came
musing down the room, Moor saw her well. With some
women dress has no relation to states of mind; with Sylvia
it was often an indication of the mental garb she wore.
Moor remembered this trait, and saw in both countenance
and costume the change that had befallen her in his long
absence. Her face was neither gay nor melancholy, but
serious and coldly quiet, as if some inward twilight reigned.
Her dress, a soft, sad grey, with no decoration but a
knot of snowdrops in her bosom. On these pale flowers her
eyes were fixed, and as she walked with folded arms and
drooping head, she sang low to herself       


'Upon the convent roof, the snows
Lie sparkling to the moon;
My breath to heaven like incense goes,
May my soul follow soon.
Lord, make my spirit pure and clear,
As are the frosty skies,
Or this first snowdrop of the year,
That in my bosom lies.'


"Sylvia!"

Very gentle was the call, but she started as if it had been
a shout, looked an instant while light and color flashed into
her face, then ran to him exclaiming joyfully       

"Oh, Geoffrey! I am glad! I am glad!"

There could be but one answer to such a welcome, and
Sylvia received it as she stood there, not weeping now, but
smiling with the sincerest satisfaction, the happiest surprise.
Moor shared both emotions, feeling as a man might feel[147]
when, parched with thirst, he stretches out his hand for a
drop of rain, and receives a brimming cup of water. He
drank a deep draught gratefully, then, fearing that it might
be as suddenly withdrawn, asked anxiously       

"Sylvia, are we friends or lovers?"

"Anything, if you will only stay."

She looked up as she spoke, and her face betrayed that a
conflict between desire and doubt was going on within her.
Impulse had sent her there, and now it was so sweet to
know herself beloved, she found it hard to go away. Her
brother's happiness had touched her heart, roused the old
craving for affection, and brought a strong desire to fill the
aching void her lost love had left with this recovered one.
Sylvia had not learned to reason yet, she could only feel,
because, owing to the unequal development of her divided
nature, the heart grew faster than the intellect. Instinct
was her surest guide, and when she followed it unblinded
by a passion, unthwarted by a mood, she prospered. But
now she was so blinded and so thwarted, and now her great
temptation came. Ambition, man's idol, had tempted the
father; love, woman's god, tempted the daughter; and, as
if the father's atonement was to be wrought out through his
dearest child the daughter also made the fatal false step of
her life.

"Then you have learned to love me, Sylvia?"

"No, the old feeling has not changed except to grow
more remorseful, more eager to prove its truth. Once you
asked me if I did not wish to love you; then I did not,
now I sincerely do. If you still want me with my many
faults, and will teach me in your gentle way to be all I
should to you, I will gladly learn, because I never needed
love as I do now. Geoffrey, shall I stay or go?"[148]

"Stay, Sylvia. Ah, thank God for this!"

If she had ever hoped that Moor would forget her for his
own sake, she now saw how vain such hope would have been,
and was both touched and troubled by the knowledge of
her supremacy which that hour gave her. She was as much
the calmer as friendship is than love, and was the first to
speak again, still standing there content although her words
expressed a doubt.

"Are you very sure you want me? Are you not tired of
the thorn that has fretted you so long? Remember, I am
so young, so ignorant, and unfitted for a wife. Can I give
you real happiness? make home what you would have it?
and never see in your face regret that some wiser, better
woman was not in my place?"

"I am sure of myself, and satisfied with you, as you are
no wiser, no better, nothing but my Sylvia."

"It is very sweet to hear you say that with such a look.
I do not deserve it but I will. Is the pain I once gave you
gone now, Geoffrey?"

"Gone forever."

"Then I am satisfied, and will begin my life anew by
trying to learn well the lesson my kind master is to teach
me."

When Moor went that night Sylvia followed him, and as
they stood together this happy moment seemed to recall that
other sad one, for taking her hands again he asked, smiling
now       

"Dear, is it good night or good by?"

"It is good by and come to-morrow."




CHAPTER XI.

WOOING.


Nothing could have been more unlike than the two pairs[149]
of lovers who from April to August haunted Mr. Yule's
house. One pair was of the popular order, for Mark was
tenderly tyrannical, Jessie adoringly submissive, and at all
hours of the day they were to be seen making tableaux of
themselves. The other pair were of the peculiar order,
undemonstrative and unsentimental, but quite as happy.
Moor knew his power, but used it generously, asking little
while giving much. Sylvia as yet found nothing to regret,
for so gently was she taught, the lesson could not seem
hard, and when her affection remained unchanged in kind,
although it deepened in degree, she said within herself       

"That strong and sudden passion was not true love, but
an unwise, unhappy delusion of my own. I should be glad
that it is gone, because I know I am not fit to be Warwick's
wife. This quiet feeling which Geoffrey inspires must be
a safer love for me, and I should be grateful that in making
his happiness I may yet find my own."

She tried heartily to forget herself in others, unconscious
that there are times when the duty we owe ourselves is
greater than that we owe to them. In the atmosphere of
cheerfulness that now surrounded her she could not but be
cheerful, and soon it would have been difficult to find a[150]
more harmonious household than this. One little cloud
alone remained to mar the general sunshine. Mark was
in a frenzy to be married, but had set his heart on a double
wedding, and Sylvia would not fix the time, always pleading       

"Let me be quite sure of myself before I take this step,
and do not wait."

Matters stood thus till Mark, having prepared his honeymoon
cottage, as a relief to his impatience, found it so irresistible
that he announced his marriage for the first of
August, and declared no human power should change his
purpose. Sylvia promised to think of it, but gave no decided
answer, for though she would hardly own it to
herself she longed to remain free till June was past. It
came and went without a sign, and July began before the
longing died a sudden death, and she consented to be
married.

Mark and Jessie came in from the city one warm morning
and found Sylvia sitting idly in the hall. She left her
preparations all to Prue, who revelled in such things, and
applied herself diligently to her lesson as if afraid she
might not learn it as she should. Half way up stairs Mark
turned and said, laughing       

"Sylvia, I saw Searle to-day,       one of the fellows whom
we met on the river last summer,       and he began to tell
me something about André and the splendid cousin, who is
married and gone abroad it seems. I did not hear much,
for Jessie was waiting; but you remember the handsome
Cubans we saw at Christmas, don't you?"

"Yes, I remember."

"Well, I thought you'd like to know that the lad had
gone home to Cleopatra's wedding, so you cannot have him[151]
to dance at yours. Have you forgotten how you waltzed
that night?"

"No, I've not forgotten."

Mark went off to consult Prue, and Jessie began to display
her purchases before eyes that only saw a blur of
shapes and colors, and expatiate upon their beauties to ears
that only heard the words       "The splendid cousin is married
and gone abroad."

"I should enjoy these pretty things a thousand times
more if you would please us all by being married when we
are," sighed Jessie, looking at her pearls.

"I will."

"What, really? Sylvia, you are a perfect darling!
Mark! Prue! she says she will!"

Away flew Jessie to proclaim the glad tidings, and Sylvia,
with a curious expression of relief, regret, and resolve, repeated
to herself that decided       

"I will."

Every one took care that Miss Caprice should not have
time to change her mind. The whole house was soon in a
bustle, for Prue ruled supreme. Mr. Yule fled from the
din of women's tongues, the bridegrooms were kept on a
very short allowance of bride, and Sylvia and Jessie were
almost invisible, for milliners and mantua-makers swarmed
about them till they felt like animated pin-cushions. The
last evening came at length, and Sylvia was just planning
an escape into the garden when Prue, whose tongue wagged
as rapidly as her hands worked, exclaimed       

"How can you stand staring out of window when there
is so much to do? Here are all these trunks to pack,
Maria in her bed with every tooth in a frightful state of
inflammation, and that capable Jane What's-her-name gone[152]
off while I was putting a chamomile poultice on her face.
If you are tired sit down and try on all your shoes, for though
Mr. Peggit has your measure, those absurd clerks seem to
think it a compliment to send children's sizes to grown
women. I'm sure my rubbers were a perfect insult."

Sylvia sat down, tugged on one boot and fell into a
reverie with the other in her hand, while Prue clacked on
like a wordmill in full operation.

"How I'm ever to get all these gowns into that trunk
passes my comprehension. There's a tray for each, of
course; but a ball dress is such a fractious thing. I could
shake that Antoinette Roche for disappointing you at the
last minute; and what you are to do for a maid, I don't
know. You'll have so much dressing to do you will be
quite worn out; and I want you to look your best on all
occasions, for you will meet everybody. This collar won't
wear well; Clara hasn't a particle of judgment, though
her taste is sweet. These hose, now, are a good, firm
article; I chose them myself. Do be sure you get all your
things from the wash. At those great hotels there's a deal
of pilfering, and you are so careless."

Here Sylvia came out of her reverie with a sigh that was
almost a groan.

"Don't they fit? I knew they wouldn't!" said Prue,
with an air of triumph.

"The boots suit me, but the hotels do not; and if it was
not ungrateful, after all your trouble, I should like to make
a bonfire of this roomful of haberdashery, and walk quietly
away to my new home by the light of it."

As if the bare idea of such an awful proceeding robbed
her of all strength, Miss Yule sat suddenly down in the
trunk by which she was standing. Fortunately it was[153]
nearly full, but her appearance was decidedly ludicrous as
she sat with the collar in one uplifted hand, the hose in the
other, and the ball dress laid over her lap like a fainting
lady; while she said, with imploring solemnity, which
changed abruptly from the pathetic to the comic at the end
of her speech       

"Sylvia, if I ever cherished a wish in this world of disappointment,
it is that your wedding shall have nothing
peculiar about it, because every friend and relation you've
got expects it. Do let me have the comfort of knowing
that every one was surprised and pleased; for if the expression
was elegant (which it isn't, and only suggested by
my trials with those dressmakers), I should say I was on
pins and needles till it's all over. Bless me! and so I am,
for here are three on the floor and one in my shoe." Prue
paused to extract the appropriate figure of speech which she
had chosen, and Sylvia said       

"If we have everything else as you wish it, would you
mind if we didn't go the journey?"

"Of course I should. Every one goes a wedding trip,
it's part of the ceremony; and if two carriages and two
bridal pairs don't leave here to-morrow, I shall feel as if all
my trouble had been thrown away."

"I'll go, Prue, I'll go; and you shall be satisfied. But
I thought we might go from here in style, and then slip off
on some quieter trip. I am so tired I dread the idea of
frolicking for a whole month, as Mark and Jessie mean
to do."

It was Prue's turn to groan now, and she did so dismally.
But Sylvia had never asked a favor in vain, and
this was not the moment to refuse to her anything, so
worldly pride yielded to sisterly affection, and Prue said[154]
with resignation, as she fell to work more vigorously than
ever, because she had wasted five good minutes       

"Do as you like, dear, you shall not be crossed on your
last day at home. Ask Geoffrey, and if you are happy I'm
satisfied."

Before Sylvia could thank her sister there came a tap
and a voice asking       

"Might I come in?"

"If you can get in," answered Prue, as, reversing her
plan in her hurry, she whisked the collar into a piecebag
and the hose into a bandbox.

Moor paused on the threshold in a masculine maze, that
one small person could need so much drapery.

"May I borrow Sylvia for a little while? A breath of
air will do her good, and I want her bright and blooming
for to-morrow, else young Mrs. Yule will outshine young
Mrs. Moor."

"What a thoughtful creature you are, Geoffrey. Take
her and welcome, only pray put on a shawl, Sylvia, and
don't stay out late, for a bride with a cold in her head is
the saddest of spectacles."

Glad to be released Sylvia went away, and, dropping the
shawl as soon as she was out of Prue's sight, paced up and
down the garden walks upon her lover's arm. Having
heard her wish and given a hearty assent Moor asked       

"Where shall we go? Tell me what you would like
best and you shall have it. You will not let me give you
many gifts, but this pleasure you will accept from me I
know."

"You give me yourself, that is more than I deserve.
But I should like to have you take me to the place you like
best. Don't tell me beforehand, let it be a surprise."[155]

"I will, it is already settled, and I know you will like
it. Is there no other wish to be granted, no doubt to be
set at rest, or regret withheld that I should know? Tell
me, Sylvia, for if ever there should be confidence between
us it is now."

As he spoke the desire to tell him of her love for Adam
rose within her, but with the desire came a thought that
modified the form in which impulse prompted her to make
confession. Moor was both sensitive and proud, would not
the knowledge of the fact mar for him the friendship that
was so much to both? From Warwick he would never
learn it, from her he should have only a half confidence,
and so love both friend and wife with an untroubled heart.
Few of us can always control the rebellious nature that so
often betrays and then reproaches, few always weigh the
moment and the act that bans or blesses it, and where is
the life that has not known some turning-point when a
fugitive emotion has decided great issues for good or ill?
Such an emotion came to Sylvia then, and another temptation,
wearing the guise of generosity, urged her to another
false step, for when the first is taken a second inevitably
follows.

"I have no wish, no regret, nothing but the old doubt
of my unstable self, and the fear that I may fail to make
you happy. But I should like to tell you something. I
don't know that you will care for it, or that there is any
need to tell it, but when you said there should be confidence
between us, I felt that I wanted you to know that I
had loved some one before I loved you."

He did not see her face, he only heard her quiet voice.
He had no thought of Adam, whom she had known so short
a time, who was already bound; he only fancied that she[156]
spoke of some young lover who had touched her heart, and
while he smiled at the nice sense of honor that prompted
the innocent confession, he said, with no coldness, no curiosity
in voice or face       

"No need to tell it, dear. I have no jealousy of any one
who has gone before me. Rest assured of this, for if I
could not share so large a heart with one who will never
claim my share I should not deserve it."

"That is so like you! Now I am quite at ease."

He looked down at her as she went beside him, thinking
that of all the brides he had ever seen his own looked least
like one.

"I always thought that you would make a very ardent
lover, Sylvia. That you would be excited, gay, and brilliant
at a time like this. But you are so quiet, so absorbed,
and so unlike your former self that I begin to think I do
not know you yet."

"You will in time. I am passionate and restless by
nature, but I am also very sensitive to all influences, personal
or otherwise, and were you different from your tranquil,
sunshiny self, I too should change. I am quiet because
I seem in a pleasant state, half-waking, half dreaming,
from which I never wish to wake. I am tired of the
past, contented with the present, and to you I leave the
future."

"It shall be a happy one if I can make it so, and to-morrow
you will give me the dear right to try."

"Yes," she said, and thinking of the solemn promises to
be then made, she added, thoughtfully, "I think I love, I
know I honor, I will try to obey. Can I do more?"

      



      



Well for them both if they could have known that friendship
is love's twin, and the gentle sisters are too often mistaken[157]
for each other. That Sylvia was innocently deceiving
both her lover and herself, by wrapping her friendship
in the garb her lost love had worn, forgetting that the wanderer
might return and claim its own, leaving the other to
suffer for the borrowed warmth. They did not know it,
and walked tranquilly together in the summer night, planning
the new life as they went, and when they parted Moor
pointed to a young moon hanging in the sky.

"See, Sylvia, our honeymoon has risen."

"May it be a happy one!"

"It will be, and when the anniversary of this glad night
comes round it shall be shining still. God bless my little
wife."




CHAPTER XII.

WEDDING.


Sylvia was awakened on her wedding morning by a[158]
curious choking sound, and starting up found Prue crying
over her as if her heart were broken.

"What has happened? Is Geoffrey ill? Is all the
silver stolen? Can't the Bishop come?" she asked, wondering
what calamity could move her sister to tears at such
a busy time.

Prue took Sylvia in her arms, and rocking to and fro as
if she were still a baby, poured forth a stream of words
and tears together.

"Nothing has happened; I came to call you, and broke
down because it was the last time I should do it. I've
been awake all night, thinking of you and all you've
been to me since I took you in my arms nineteen years ago,
and said you should be mine. My little Sylvia, I've been
neglectful of so many things, and now I see them all; I've
fretted you with my ways, and haven't been patient enough
with yours; I've been selfish even about your wedding, and
it won't be as you like it; you'll reproach me in your heart,
and I shall hate myself for it when you are gone never to
be my care and comfort any more. And       oh, my dear,
my dear, what shall I do without you?"

This unexpected demonstration from her prosaic sister[159]
touched Sylvia more than the most sentimental lamentations
from another. It brought to mind all the past devotion,
the future solitude of Prue's life, and she clung about
her neck tearless but very tender.

"I never shall reproach you, never cease to love and
thank you for all you've been to me, my dear old girl.
You mustn't grieve over me, or think I shall forget you, for
you never shall be forsaken; and very soon I shall be back,
almost as much your Sylvia as ever. Mark will live on one
side, I shall live on the other, and we'll be merry and cosy
together. And who knows but when we are both out of
your way you will learn to think of yourself and marry
also."

At this Prue began to laugh hysterically, and exclaimed,
with more than her usual incoherency       

"I must tell you, it was so very odd! I didn't mean
to do so, because you children would tease me; but now I
will to make you laugh, for it's a bad omen to cry over
a bride, they say. My dear, that gouty Mr. MacGregor,
when I went in with some of my nice broth last week
(Hugh slops so, and he's such a fidget, I took it myself),
after he had eaten every drop before my eyes, wiped his
mouth and asked me to marry him."

"And you would not, Prue?"

"Bless me, child, how could I? I must take care of my
poor dear father, and he isn't pleasant in the least, you
know, but would wear my life out in a week. I really
pitied him, however, when I refused him, with a napkin
round his neck, and he tapped his waistcoat with a spoon
so comically, when he offered me his heart, as if it were
something good to eat."

"How very funny! What made him do it, Prue?"[160]

"He said he'd watched the preparations from his window,
and got so interested in weddings that he wanted one
himself, and felt drawn to me I was so sympathetic. That
means a good nurse and cook, my dear. I understand these
invalid gentlemen, and will be a slave to no man so fat and
fussy as Mr. Mac, as my brother calls him. It's not respectful,
but I like to refresh myself by saying it just now."

"Never mind the old soul, Prue, but go and have your
breakfast comfortably, for there's much to be done, and
no one is to dress me but your own dear self."

At this Prue relapsed into the pathetic again, and cried
over her sister as if, despite the omen, brides were plants
that needed much watering.

The appearance of the afflicted Maria, with her face still
partially eclipsed by the chamomile comforter, and an announcement
that the waiters had come and were "ordering
round dreadful," caused Prue to pocket her handkerchief
and descend to turn the tables in every sense of the word.

The prospect of the wedding breakfast made the usual
meal a mere mockery. Every one was in a driving hurry,
every one was very much excited, and nobody but Prue and
the colored gentlemen brought anything to pass. Sylvia
went from room to room bidding them good-by as the child
who had played there so long. But each looked unfamiliar
in its state and festival array, and the old house seemed
to have forgotten her already. She spent an hour with her
father, paid Mark a little call in the studio where he was
bidding adieu to the joys of bachelorhood, and preparing
himself for the jars of matrimony by a composing smoke,
and then Prue claimed her.

The agonies she suffered during that long toilet are beyond
the powers of language to portray, for Prue surpassed[161]
herself and was the very essence of fussiness. But Sylvia
bore it patiently as a last sacrifice, because her sister was
very tender-hearted still, and laughed and cried over her
work till all was done, when she surveyed the effect with
pensive satisfaction.

"You are very sweet, my dear, and so delightfully calm,
you really do surprise me. I always thought you'd have
hysterics on your wedding-day, and got my vinaigrette all
ready. Keep your hands just as they are, with the handkerchief
and bouquet, it looks very easy and rich. Dear me,
what a spectacle I've made of myself! But I shall cry no
more, not even during the ceremony as many do. Such
displays of feeling are in very bad taste, and I shall be firm,
perfectly firm, so if you hear any one sniff you'll know it
isn't me. Now I must go and scramble on my dress;
first, let me arrange you smoothly in a chair. There, my
precious, now think of soothing things, and don't stir
till Geoffrey comes for you."

Too tired to care what happened just then, Sylvia sat as
she was placed, feeling like a fashion-plate of a bride, and
wishing she could go to sleep. Presently the sound of steps
as fleet as Mark's but lighter, waked her up, and forgetting
orders, she rustled to the door with an expression which
fashion-plates have not yet attained.

"Good morning, little bride."

"Good morning, bonny bridegroom."

Then they looked at one another, and both smiled. But
they seemed to have changed characters, for Moor's usually
tranquil face was full of pale excitement; Sylvia's usually
vivacious one, full of quietude, and her eyes wore the unquestioning
content of a child who accepts some friendly
hand, sure that it will lead it right.[162]

"Prue desires me to take you out into the upper hall, and
when Mr. Deane beckons, we are to go down at once. The
rooms are full, and Jessie is ready. Shall we go?"

"One moment: Geoffrey, are you quite happy now?"

"Supremely happy!"

"Then it shall be the first duty of my life to keep you
so," and with a gesture soft yet solemn, Sylvia laid her
hand in his, as if endowing him with both gift and giver.
He held it fast and never let it go until it was his own.

In the upper hall they found Mark hovering about Jessie
like an agitated bee, about a very full-blown flower, and
Clara Deane flapping him away, lest he should damage the
effect of this beautiful white rose. For ten minutes, ages
they seemed, the five stood together listening to the stir below,
looking at one another, till they were tired of the sight
and scent of orange blossoms, and wishing that the whole
affair was safely over. But the instant a portentous "Hem!"
was heard, and a white glove seen to beckon from the stair
foot, every one fell into a flutter. Moor turned paler still,
and Sylvia felt his heart beat hard against her hand. She
herself was seized with a momentary desire to run away and
say "No" again; Mark looked as if nerving himself for
immediate execution, and Jessie feebly whispered       

"Oh, Clara, I'm going to faint!"

"Good heavens, what shall I do with her? Mark, support
her! My darling girl, smell this and bear up. For
mercy sake do something, Sylvia, and don't stand there
looking as if you'd been married every day for a year."

In his excitement, Mark gave his bride a little shake. Its
effect was marvellous. She rallied instantly, with a reproachful
glance at her crumpled veil and a decided       

"Come quick, I can go now."[163]

Down they went, through a wilderness of summer silks,
black coats, and bridal gloves. How they reached their
places none of them ever knew; Mark said afterward, that
the instinct of self preservation led him to the only means
of extrication that circumstances allowed. The moment
the Bishop opened his book, Prue took out her handkerchief
and cried steadily through the entire ceremony, for
dear as were the proprieties, the "children" were dearer
still.

At Sylvia's desire, Mark was married first, and as she stood
listening to the sonorous roll of the service falling from the
Bishop's lips, she tried to feel devout and solemn, but failed
to do so. She tried to keep her thoughts from wandering,
but continually found herself wondering if that sob
came from Prue, if her father felt it very much, and when
it would be done. She tried to keep her eyes fixed timidly
upon the carpet as she had been told to do, but they would
rise and glance about against her will.

One of these derelictions from the path of duty, nearly
produced a catastrophe. Little Tilly, the gardener's pretty
child, had strayed in from among the servants peeping at a
long window in the rear, and established herself near the
wedding group, looking like a small ballet girl in her full
white frock and wreath pushed rakishly askew on her curly
pate. As she stood regarding the scene with dignified
amazement, her eye met Sylvia's. In spite of the unusual
costume, the baby knew her playmate, and running to her,
thrust her head under the veil with a delighted "Peep
a bo!" Horror seized Jessie, Mark was on the brink of a
laugh, and Moor looked like one fallen from the clouds.
But Sylvia drew the little marplot close to her with a warning
[164]word, and there she stayed, quietly amusing herself
with "pooring" the silvery dress, smelling the flowers and
staring at the Bishop.

After this, all prospered. The gloves came smoothly off,
the rings went smoothly on; no one cried but Prue, no one
laughed but Tilly; the brides were admired, the grooms
envied; the service pronounced impressive, and when it
ended, a tumult of congratulations arose.

Sylvia always had a very confused idea of what happened
during the next hour. She remembered being kissed till
her cheeks burned, and shaken hands with till her fingers
tingled; bowing in answer to toasts, and forgetting to reply
when addressed by the new name; trying to eat and drink,
and discovering that everything tasted of wedding cake;
finding herself up stairs hurrying on her travelling dress,
then down stairs saying good by; and when her father
embraced her last of all, suddenly realizing with a pang,
that she was married and going away, never to be little
Sylvia any more.

Prue was gratified to her heart's content, for, when the
two bridal carriages had vanished with handkerchiefs flying
from their windows, in answer to the white whirlwind
on the lawn, Mrs. Grundy, with an approving smile on
her aristocratic countenance, pronounced this the most
charming affair of the season.




CHAPTER XIII.

SYLVIA'S HONEYMOON.


It began with a pleasant journey. Day after day they[165]
loitered along country roads that led them through many
scenes of summer beauty; pausing at old-fashioned inns
and wayside farmhouses, or gipsying at noon in some green
nook where their four-footed comrades dined off their tablecloth
while they made merry over the less simple fare their
last hostess had provided for them. When the scenery was
uninteresting, as was sometimes the case, for Nature will
not disturb her domestic arrangements for any bridal pair,
one or the other read aloud, or both sang, while conversation
was a never-failing pastime and silence had charms which
they could enjoy. Sometimes they walked a mile or two,
ran down a hillside, rustled through a grain field, strolled
into an orchard, or feasted from fruitful hedges by the way,
as care-free as the squirrels on the wall, or the jolly brown
bees lunching at the sign of "The Clover-top." They
made friends with sheep in meadows, cows at the brook,
travellers morose or bland, farmers full of a sturdy sense
that made their chat as wholesome as the mould they delved
in; school children barefooted and blithe, and specimens of
womankind, from the buxom housewife who took them
under her motherly wing at once, to the sour, snuffy, shoe-[166]binding
spinster with "No Admittance" written all over
her face.

To Moor the world was glorified with the purple light
which seldom touches it but once for any of us; the journey
was a wedding march, made beautiful by summer,
victorious by joy; his young wife the queen of women, and
himself an equal of the gods because no longer conscious
of a want. Sylvia could not be otherwise than happy, for
finding unbounded liberty and love her portion, she had
nothing to regret, and regarded marriage as an agreeable
process which had simply changed her name and given her
protector, friend, and lover all in one. She was therefore her
sweetest and sincerest self, miraculously docile, and charmingly
gay; interested in all she saw, and quite overflowing
with delight when the last days of the week betrayed the
secret that her destination was the mountains.

Loving the sea so well, her few flights from home had
given her only marine experiences, and the flavor of entire
novelty was added to the feast her husband had provided
for her. It came to her not only when she could enjoy it
most, but when she needed it most, soothing the unquiet,
stimulating the nobler elements which ruled her life by
turns and fitting her for what lay before her. Choosing the
quietest roads, Moor showed her the wonders of a region
whose wild grandeur and beauty make its memory a life-long
satisfaction. Day after day they followed mountain
paths, studying the changes of an ever-varying landscape,
watching the flush of dawn redden the granite fronts of
these Titans scarred with centuries of storm, the lustre of
noon brood over them until they smiled, the evening purple
wrap them in its splendor, or moonlight touch them with its
magic; till Sylvia, always looking up at that which filled[167]
her heart with reverence and awe, was led to look beyond,
and through the medium of the friend beside her learned
that human love brings us nearer to the Divine, and is the
surest means to that great end.

The last week of the honeymoon came all too soon, for
then they had promised to return. The crowning glory of
the range was left until the last, and after a day of memorable
delights Sylvia sat in the sunset feasting her eyes upon
the wonders of a scene which is indescribable, for words
have limits and that is apparently illimitable. Presently
Moor came to her asking       

"Will you join a party to the great ice palace, and see
three acres of snow in August, worn by a waterfall into a
cathedral, as white if not as durable as any marble?"

"I sit so comfortably here I think I had rather not.
But you must go because you like such wonders, and I
shall rest till you come back."

"Then I shall take myself off and leave you to muse
over the pleasures of the day, which for a few hours has
made you one of the most eminent women this side the Rocky
Mountains. There is a bugle at the house here with which
to make the echoes, I shall take it with me, and from time
to time send up a sweet reminder that you are not to stray
away and lose yourself."

Sylvia sat for half an hour, then wearied by the immensity
of the wide landscape she tried to rest her mind by
examining the beauties close at hand. Strolling down the
path the sight-seers had taken, she found herself in a rocky
basin, scooped in the mountain side like a cup for a little
pool, so clear and bright it looked a diamond set in jet. A
fringe of scanty herbage had collected about its brim,
russet mosses, purple heath, and delicate white flowers,[168]
like a band of tiny hill people keeping their revels by some
fairy well. The spot attracted her, and remembering that
she was not to stray away, she sat down beside the path to
wait for her husband's return.

In the act of bending over the pool to sprinkle the thirsty
little company about it, her hand was arrested by the
tramp of approaching feet, and looking up to discover who
was the disturber of her retreat, she saw a man pausing
at the top of the path opposite to that by which she had
come. He seemed scrutinizing the solitary occupant of the
dell before descending; but as she turned her face to him
he flung away knapsack, hat, and staff, and then with a
great start she saw no stranger, but Adam Warwick. Coming
down to her so joyfully, so impetuously, she had only
time to recognise him, and cry out, when she was swept up
in an embrace as tender as irresistible, and lay there conscious
of nothing, but that happiness like some strong swift
angel had wrapt her away into the promised land so long
believed in, hungered for, and despaired of, as forever lost.
Soon she heard his voice, breathless, eager, but so fond it
seemed another voice than his.

"My darling! did you think I should never come?"

"I thought you had forgotten me, I knew you were married.
Adam, put me down."

But he only held her closer, and laughed such a happy
laugh that Sylvia felt the truth before he uttered it.

"How could I marry, loving you? How could I forget
you even if I had never come to tell you this? Sylvia, I
know much that has passed. Geoffrey's failure gave me
courage to hope for success, and that the mute betrothal
made with a look so long ago had been to you all it has
been to me."[169]

"Adam, you are both right and wrong,       you do not
know all,       let me tell you,"       began Sylvia, as these
proofs of ignorance brought her to herself with a shock of
recollection and dismay. But Warwick was as absolute
in his happiness as he had been in his self-denial, and took
possession of her mentally as well as physically with a despotism
too welcome and entire to be at once resisted.

"You shall tell me nothing till I have shown the cause
of my hard-seeming silence. I must throw off that burden
first, then I will listen to you until morning if you
will. I have earned this moment by a year of effort, let
me keep you here and enjoy it without alloy."

The old charm had lost none of its power, for absence
seemed to have gifted it with redoubled potency, the confirmation
of that early hope to grace it with redoubled warmth.
Sylvia let him keep her, feeling that he had earned that
small reward for a year's endeavor, resolving to grant all
now left her to bestow, a few moments more of blissful ignorance,
then to show him his loss and comfort him, sure
that her husband would find no disloyalty in a compassion
scarcely less deep and self-forgetful than his own would
have been had he shared their secret. Only pausing to
place himself upon the seat she had left, Warwick put off
her hat, and turning her face to his regarded it with such
unfeigned and entire content her wavering purpose was fixed
by a single look. Then as he began to tell the story of the
past she forgot everything but the rapid words she listened
to, the countenance she watched, so beautifully changed and
softened, it seemed as if she had never seen the man
before, or saw him now as we sometimes see familiar figures
glorified in dreams. In the fewest, kindest words Warwick
told her of Ottila, the promise and the parting; then, as if[170]
the dearer theme deserved less brevity, he lingered on it as
one lingers at a friend's door, enjoying in anticipation the
welcome he is sure awaits him.

"The night we walked together by the river       such a
wilful yet winning comrade as I had that day, and how I
enjoyed it all!       that night I suspected that Geoffrey loved
you, Sylvia, and was glad to think it. A month later I
was sure of it, and found in that knowledge the great hardship
of my life, because I loved you myself. Audacious
thing! how dared you steal into my heart and take possession
when I had turned my last guest out and barred the
door? I thought I had done with the sentiment that had
so nearly wrecked me once, but see how blind I was       the
false love only made me readier for the true. You never
seemed a child to me, Sylvia, because you have an old soul
in a young body, and your father's trials and temptations
live again in you. This first attracted me. I liked to
watch, to question, to study the human enigma to which I
had found a clue from its maker's lips. I liked your candor
and simplicity, your courage and caprice. Even your
faults found favor in my eyes; for pride, will, impetuosity
were old friends of mine, and I liked to see them working
in another shape. At first you were a curiosity, then an
amusement, then a necessity. I wanted you, not occasionally,
but constantly. You put salt and savor into life for
me; for whether you spoke or were silent, were sweet or
sour, friendly or cold, I was satisfied to feel your nearness,
and always took away an inward content which nothing
else could give me. This affection was so unlike the other
that I deceived myself for a time       not long. I soon knew
what had befallen me, soon felt that this sentiment was
good to feel, because I forgot my turbulent and worser self[171]
and felt the nobler regenerated by the innocent companionship
you gave me. I wanted you, but it was not the touch
of hands or lips, the soft encounter of eyes, the tones of
tenderness, I wanted most. It was that something beyond
my reach, vital and vestal, invisible, yet irresistible; that
something, be it heart, soul, or mind, which drew me to
you by an attraction genial and genuine as itself. My Sylvia,
that was love, and when it came to me I took it in,
sure that whether its fruition was granted or denied I
should be a manlier man for having harbored it even for an
hour. Why turn your face away? Well, hide it if you
will, but lean here as you did once so long ago."

She let him lay it on his shoulder, still feeling that
Moor was one to look below the surface of these things and
own that she did well in giving so pure a love a happy
moment before its death, as she would have cherished
Warwick had he laid dying.

"On that September evening, as I sat alone, I had been
thinking of what might be and what must be. Had decided
that I would go away for Geoffrey's sake. He was
fitter than I to have you, being so gentle, and in all ways
ready to possess a wife. I was so rough, such a vagrant,
so full of my own purposes and plans, how could I dare
to take into my keeping such a tender little creature as
yourself? I thought you did not care for me; I knew
any knowledge of my love would only mar his own; so it
was best to go at once and leave him to the happiness he
so well deserved. Just then you came to me, as if the
wind had blown my desire to my arms. Such a loving
touch that was! it nearly melted my resolve, it seemed
hard not to take the one thing I wanted, when it came to
me so opportunely. I yearned to break that idle promise,[172]
made when I was vain in my own conceit, and justly punished
for its folly; but you said keep it, and I did. You
could not understand my trouble, and when I sat before
you so still, perhaps looking grim and cold, you did not
know how I was wrestling with my unruly self. I am not
truly generous, for the relinquishment of any cherished
object always costs a battle, and I too often find I am
worsted. For the first time I dared not meet your eyes till
you dived into mine with that expression wistful and guileless,
which has often made me feel as if we stood divested
of our bodies, soul to soul.

"Tongue I could control, heart I could not. Up it
sprung stronger than will, swifter than thought, and answered
you. Sylvia, had there been one ray of self-consciousness
in those steady eyes of yours, one atom of maiden
shame, or fear, or trouble, I should have claimed you as my
own. There was not; and though you let me read your
face like an open book, you never dreamed what eloquence
was in it. Innocent heart, that loved and had not learned
to know it. I saw this instantly, saw that a few more such
encounters would show it to you likewise, and felt more
strongly than before that if ever the just deed to you, the
generous one to Geoffrey were done, it should be then. For
that was the one moment when your half-awakened heart
could fall painlessly asleep again, if I did not disturb it,
and dream on till Geoffrey woke it, to find a gentler master
than I could be to it."

"It could not, Adam; you had wholly roused it, and
it cried for you so long, so bitterly, oh, why did you not
come to answer it before?"

"How could I till the year was over? Was I not obeying
you in keeping that accursed promise? God knows I[173]
have made many blunders, but I think the most senseless
was that promise; the most short-sighted, that belief.
What right had I to fetter my tongue, or try to govern
love? Shall I ever learn to do my own work aright, and
not meddle with the Lord's? Sylvia, take this presumptuous
and domineering devil out of me in time, lest I blunder
as blindly after you are mine as I have before. Now
let me finish before Mark comes to find us. I went away,
you know, singing the farewell I dared not speak, and for
nine months kept myself sane and steady with whatever
my hands found to do. If ever work of mine is blessed it
will be that, for into it I put the best endeavor of my life.
Though I had renounced you, I kept my love; let it burn
day and night, fed it with labor and with prayer, trusting
that this selfish heart of mine might be recast and made a
fitter receptacle for an enduring treasure. In May, far at
the West, I met a woman who knew Geoffrey; had seen
him lately, and learned that he had lost you. She was his
cousin, I his friend, and through our mutual interest in him
this confidence naturally came about. When she told me
this hope blazed up, and all manner of wild fancies haunted
me. Love is arrogant, and I nourished a belief that even
I might succeed where Geoffrey failed. You were so young,
you were not likely to be easily won by any other, if such
a man had asked in vain, and a conviction gradually took
possession of me that you had understood, had loved, and
were yet waiting for me. A month seemed an eternity to
wait, but I left myself no moment for despair, and soon
turned my face to Cuba, finding renewed hope on the way.
Gabriel went with me, told me how Ottila had searched for
me, and failing to find me had gone back to make ready
for my coming. How she had tried to be all I desired, and[174]
how unworthy I was of her. This was well, but the mention
of your name was better, and much close questioning
gave me the scene which he remembered, because Ottila had
chidden him sharply for his disclosures to yourself. Knowing
you so well, I gathered much from trifles which were
nothing in Gabriel's eyes. I felt that regard for me, if
nothing warmer, had prompted your interest in them; and
out of the facts given me by Faith and Gabriel I built
myself a home, which I have inhabited as a guest till now,
when I know myself its master, and welcome its dear mistress,
so my darling."

He bent to give her tender greeting, but Sylvia arrested
him.

"Not yet, Adam! not yet! Go on, before it is too late
to tell me as you wish."

He thought it was some maidenly scruple, and though
he smiled at it he respected it, for this same coyness in the
midst of all her whims had always been one of her attractions
in his eye.

"Shy thing! I will tame you yet, and draw you to me
as confidingly as I drew the bird to hop into my hand and
eat. You must not fear me, Sylvia, else I shall grow tyrannical;
for I hate fear, and like to trample on whatever dares
not fill its place bravely, sure that it will receive its due as
trustfully as these little mosses sit among the clouds and
find a spring to feed them even in the rock. Now I will
make a speedy end of this, pleasant as it is to sit here feeling
myself no longer a solitary waif. I shall spare you the
stormy scenes I passed through with Ottila, because I do
not care to think of my Cleopatra while I hold 'my fine
spirit Ariel' in my arms. She had done her best, but had
I been still heart-free I never could have married her. She[175]
is one of those tameless natures which only God can govern;
I dared not, even when I thought I loved her, for much as I
love power I love truth more. I told her this, heard
prayers, reproaches, threats, and denunciations; tried to
leave her kindly, and then was ready for my fate with you.
But I was not to have my will so easily. I had fallen into
the net, and was not to leave it till the scourging had been
given. So like that other wandering Christian, I cried out,
submitted, and was the meeker for it. I had to wait a little
before the ship sailed; I would not stay at El Labarinto,
Gabriel's home, for Ottila was there; and though the fever
raged at Havana, I felt secure in my hitherto unbroken
health. I returned there, and paid the penalty; for weeks
of suffering taught me that I could not trifle with this body
of mine, sturdy as it seemed."

"Oh, Adam, who took care of you? Where did you lie
and suffer all that time?"

"Never fret yourself concerning that; I was not neglected.
A sister of the 'Sacred Heart' took excellent
care of me, and a hospital is as good as a palace when one
neither knows nor cares where he is. It went hardly with
me, I believe; but being resolved to live, I fought it
through. Death looked at me, had compassion, and passed
by. There is a Haytien proverb which must comfort you if I
am a gaunt ghost of my former self: 'A lean freeman is
better than a fat slave.' There comes the first smile I have
seen; but my next bit of news will bring a frown, I think.
When I was well enough to creep out, I learned that Ottila
was married. You heard the rumor, doubtless, but not the
name, for Gabriel's and mine were curiously blended in
many minds by the suddenness of my disappearance and his
appearance as the bridegroom. It was like her,       she had[176]
prepared for me as if sure I was to fill the place I had left,
hoping that this confidence of hers would have its due
effect upon me. It did try me sorely, but an experience
once over is as if it had never been, as far as regret or indecision
is concerned; therefore wedding gowns and imperious
women failed to move me. To be left a groomless
bride stung that fiery pride of hers more than many an
actual shame or sin would have done. People would pity
her, would see her loss, deride her wilful folly. Gabriel
loved her as she desired to be loved, blindly and passionately;
few knew of our later bond, many of our betrothal,
why not let the world believe me the rejected party come
back for a last appeal? I had avoided all whom I once
knew, for I loathed the place; no one had discovered me at
the hospital, she thought me gone, she boldly took the step,
married the poor boy, left Cuba before I was myself again,
and won herself an empty victory which I never shall disturb."

"How strange! Yet I can believe it of her, she looked
a woman who would dare do anything. Then you came
back, Adam, to find me? What led you here, hoping so
much and knowing so little?"

"Did you ever know me do anything in the accustomed
way? Do I not always aim straight at the thing I want
and pursue it by the shortest road? It fails often, and I
go back to the slower surer way; but my own is always
tried first, as involuntarily as I hurled myself down that
slope, as if storming a fort instead of meeting my sweetheart.
That is a pretty old word beloved of better men
than I, so let me use it once. Among the first persons I
met on landing was a friend of your father's; he was just
driving away in hot haste, but catching a glimpse of the[177]
familiar face, I bethought me that it was the season for
summer travel, you might be away, and no one else would
satisfy me; he might know, and time be saved. I asked one
question, 'Where are the Yules?' He answered, as he
vanished, 'The young people are all at the mountains.'
That was enough, and congratulating myself on the forethought
which would save me some hundred miles of needless
delay, away I went, and for days have been searching
for you every where on that side of these hills which I know
so well. But no Yules had passed, and feeling sure you
were on this side I came, not around, but straight over, for
this seemed a royal road to my love, and here I found her
waiting for me by the way. Now Sylvia, are your doubts
all answered, your fears all laid, your heart at rest on mine?"

As the time drew nearer Sylvia's task daunted her.
Warwick was so confident, so glad and tender over her, it
seemed like pronouncing the death doom to say those hard
words, "It is too late." While she struggled to find some
expression that should tell all kindly yet entirely, Adam,
seeming to read some hint of her trouble, asked, with that
gentleness which now overlaid his former abruptness, and
was the more alluring for the contrast       

"Have I been too arrogant a lover? too sure of happiness,
too blind to my small deserts? Sylvia, have I misunderstood
the greeting you have given me?"

"Yes, Adam, utterly."

He knit his brows, his eye grew anxious, his content
seemed rudely broken, but still hopefully he said       

"You mean that absence has changed you, that you do
not love me as you did, and pity made you kind? Well,
I receive the disappointment, but I do not relinquish my
desire. What has been may be; let me try again to earn[178]
you; teach me to be humble, patient, all that I should be
to make myself more dear to you. Something disturbs you,
be frank with me; I have shown you all my heart, what
have you to show me in return?"

"Only this."

She freed herself entirely from his hold and held up her
hand before him. He did not see the ring; he thought she
gave him all he asked, and with a glow of gratitude extended
both his own to take it. Then she saw that delay was worse
than weak, and though she trembled she spoke out bravely
ending his suspense at once.

"Adam, I do not love you as I did, nor can I wish or try
to bring it back, because       I am married."

He sprung up as if shot through the heart, nor could a
veritable bullet from her hand have daunted him with a
more intense dismay than those three words. An instant's
incredulity, then conviction came to him, and he met it like
a man, for though his face whitened and his eye burned
with an expression that wrung her heart, he demanded
steadily,       

"To whom?"

This was the hardest question of all, for well she knew
the name would wound the deeper for its dearness, and
while it lingered pitifully upon her lips its owner answered
for himself. Clear and sweet came up the music of the
horn, bringing them a familiar air they all loved, and
had often sung together. Warwick knew it instantly, felt
the hard truth but rebelled against it, and put out his arm
as if to ward it off as he exclaimed, with real anguish in
countenance and voice       

"Oh, Sylvia! it is not Geoffrey?"

"Yes."[179]

Then, as if all strength had gone out of her, she dropped
down upon the mossy margin of the spring and covered up
her face, feeling that the first sharpness of a pain like this
was not for human eyes to witness. How many minutes
passed she could not tell, the stillness of the spot remained
unbroken by any sound but the whisper of the wind, and
in this silence Sylvia found time to marvel at the calmness
which came to her. Self had been forgotten in surprise
and sympathy, and still her one thought was how to comfort
Warwick. She had expected some outburst of feeling,
some gust of anger or despair, but neither sigh nor sob,
reproach nor regret reached her, and soon she stole an
anxious glance to see how it went with him. He was standing
where she left him, both hands locked together till they
were white with the passionate pressure. His eyes fixed on
some distant object with a regard as imploring as unseeing,
and through those windows of the soul he looked out darkly,
not despairingly; but as if sure that somewhere there was
help for him, and he waited for it with a stern patience
more terrible to watch than the most tempestuous grief.
Sylvia could not bear it, and remembering that her confession
had not yet been made, seized that instant for the
purpose, prompted by an instinct which assured her that the
knowledge of her pain would help him to bear his own.

She told him all, and ended saying       

"Now, Adam, come to me and let me try to comfort
you."

Sylvia was right; for through the sorrowful bewilderment
that brought a brief eclipse of hope and courage, sympathy
reached him like a friendly hand to uphold him till he
found the light again. While speaking, she had seen the
immobility that frightened her break up, and Warwick's[180]
whole face flush and quiver with the rush of emotions
controllable no longer. But the demonstration which followed
was one she had never thought to see from him, for
when she stretched her hands to him with that tender invitation,
she saw the deep eyes fill and overflow. Then he
threw himself down before her, and for the first time in her
short life showed her that sad type of human suffering, a
man weeping like a woman.

Warwick was one of those whose passions, as his virtues,
were in unison with the powerful body they inhabited, and
in such a crisis as the present but one of two reliefs were
possible to him; either wrathful denunciation, expostulation
and despair, or the abandon of a child. Against the former
he had been struggling dumbly till Sylvia's words had
turned the tide, and too entirely natural to feel a touch of
shame at that which is not a weakness but a strength,
too wise to reject so safe an outlet for so dangerous a grief,
he yielded to it, letting the merciful magic of tears quench
the fire, wash the first bitterness away, and leave reproaches
only writ in water. It was better so, and Sylvia acknowledged
it within herself as she sat mute and motionless,
softly touching the brown hair scattered on the moss, her
poor consolation silenced by the pathos of the sight, while
through it all rose and fell the fitful echo of the horn, in
very truth "a sweet reminder not to stray away and lose
herself." An hour ago it would have been a welcome sound,
for peak after peak gave back the strain, and airy voices
whispered it until the faintest murmur died. But now she
let it soar and sigh half heard, for audible to her alone still
came its sad accompaniment of bitter human tears. To
Warwick it was far more; for music, the comforter, laid her
balm on his sore heart as no mortal pity could have done,[181]
and wrought the miracle which changed the friend who
seemed to have robbed him of his love to an unconscious
Orpheus, who subdued the savage and harmonized the man.
Soon he was himself again, for to those who harbor the
strong virtues with patient zeal, no lasting ill can come,
no affliction can wholly crush, no temptation wholly vanquish.
He rose with eyes the clearer for their stormy rain,
twice a man for having dared to be a child again. Humbler
and happier for the knowledge that neither vain resentment
nor unjust accusation had defrauded of its dignity, the
heavy hour that left him desolate but not degraded.

"I am comforted, Sylvia, rest assured of that. And
now there is little more to say, but one thing to do. I
shall not see your husband yet, and leave you to tell him
what seems best, for, with the instinct of an animal, I
always go away to outlive my hurts alone. But remember
that I acquit you of blame, and believe that I will yet be
happy in your happiness. I know if Geoffrey were here, he
would let me do this, because he has suffered as I suffer
now."

Bending, he gathered her to an embrace as different from
that other as despair is from delight, and while he held her
there, crowding into one short minute, all the pain and passion
of a year, she heard a low, but exceeding bitter
cry       "Oh, my Sylvia! it is hard to give you up."
Then with a solemn satisfaction, which assured her as it
did himself, he spoke out clear and loud       

"Thank God for the merciful Hereafter, in which we
may retrieve the blunders we make here."

With that he left her, never turning till the burden so
joyfully cast down had been resumed. Then, staff and hat
in hand, he paused on the margin of that granite cup, to[182]
him a cup of sorrow, and looked into its depths again.
Clouds were trooping eastward, but in that pause the sun
glanced full on Warwick's figure, lifting his powerful
head into a flood of light, as he waved his hand to Sylvia
with a gesture of courage and good cheer. The look, the
act, the memories they brought her, made her heart ache
with a sharper pang than pity, and filled her eyes with tears
of impotent regret, as she turned her head as if to chide
the blithe clamor of the horn. When she looked again, the
figure and the sunshine were both gone, leaving her alone
and in the shadow.




CHAPTER XIV.

A FIRESIDE FETE.


"No cousin Faith to-night. The rain has prevented her[183]
from taking this boat, and she is not likely to come later as
she comes alone," said Moor, returning from a fruitless
drive to meet his expected guest one October evening.

"It always rains when I want anything very much. I
seem to have a great deal of bad weather in my life," answered
Sylvia, despondingly.

"Never mind the rain; let us make sunshine for ourselves,
and forget it as children do."

"I wish I was a child again, they are always happy."

"Let us play at being children, then. Let us sit down
upon the rug, parch corn, crack nuts, roast apples, and be
merry in spite of wind or weather."

Sylvia's face brightened, for the fancy pleased her, and
she wanted something new and pleasant to divert her
thoughts from herself. Glancing at her dress, which was
unusually matronly in honor of the occasion, she said smiling       

"I don't look much like a child, but I should like to try
and feel like one again if I can."

"Let us both look and feel so as much as possible. You
like masquerading; go make a little girl of yourself, while I
turn boy, and prepare for our merry making."[184]

No lad could have spoken with a blither face, for Moor
had preserved much of the boy in spite of his thirty years.
His cheerfulness was so infectious, that Sylvia already began
to forget her gloom, and hurried away to do her part.
Putting on a short, girlish gown, kept for scrambles among
the rocks, she improvised a pinafore, and braided her long
hair a la Morlena Kenwigs, with butterfly bows at the ends.
When she went down, she found her husband in garden
jacket, collar turned over a ribbon, hair in a curly tumble,
and jackknife in hand, seated on the rug before a roaring
fire, and a semicircle of apples, whittling and whistling
like a very boy. They examined one another with mirthful
commendations, and Moor began his part by saying       

"Isn't this jolly? Now come and cuddle down here
beside me, and see which will keep it up the longest."

"What would Prue say? and who would recognize the
elegant Mr. Moor in this big boy? Putting dignity and
broadcloth aside makes you look about eighteen, and very
charming I find you," said Sylvia, looking about twelve
herself, and also very charming.

"Here is a wooden fork for you to tend the roast with,
while I see to the corn laws and prepare a vegetable snowstorm.
What will you have, little girl, you look as if you
wanted something?"

"I was only thinking that I should have a doll to match
your knife. I feel as if I should enjoy trotting a staring
fright on my knee, and singing Hush-a-by. But I fancy
even your magic cannot produce such a thing,       can it, my
lad?"

"In exactly five minutes a lovely doll will appear,
though such a thing has not been seen in my bachelor establishment
for years."[185]

With which mysterious announcement Moor ran off, blundering
over the ottomans and slamming the doors as a true
boy should. Sylvia pricked chestnuts, and began to forget
her bosom trouble as she wondered what would appear with
the impatient curiosity appropriate to the character she had
assumed. Presently her husband reappeared with much
breeziness of aspect, rain drops in his hair, and a squirming
bundle in his arms. Triumphantly unfolding many
wraps, he displayed little Tilly in her night-gown.

"There is sorcery for you, and a doll worth having; being
one of the sort that can shut its eyes; it was going to bed,
but its mamma relented and lends it to us for the night.
I told Mrs. Dodd you wanted her, and couldn't wait, so she
sent her clothes; but the room is so warm let the dear play
in her pretty bed-gown."

Sylvia received her lovely plaything with enthusiasm,
and Tilly felt herself suddenly transported to a baby's Paradise,
where beds were unknown and fruit and freedom were
her welcome portion. Merrily popped the corn, nimbly
danced the nuts upon the shovel, lustily remonstrated the
rosy martyrs on the hearth, and cheerfully the minutes
slipped away. Sylvia sung every jubilant air she knew,
Moor whistled astonishing accompaniments, and Tilly danced
over the carpet with nut-shells on her toes, and tried to fill
her little gown with "pitty flowers" from its garlands and
bouquets. Without the wind lamented, the sky wept, and
the sea thundered on the shore; but within, youth, innocence,
and love held their blithe revel undisturbed.

"How are the spirits now?" asked one playmate of the
other.

"Quite merry, thank you; and I should think I was
little Sylvia again but for the sight of this."[186]

She held up the hand that wore a single ornament; but
the hand had grown so slender since it was first put on, that
the ring would have fallen had she not caught it at her
finger-tip. There was nothing of the boy in her companion's
face, as he said, with an anxious look       

"If you go on thinning so fast I shall begin to fear that
the little wife is not happy with her old husband. Is she,
dear?"

"She would be a most ungrateful woman if she were not.
I always get thin as winter comes on, but I'm so careless
I'll find a guard for my ring to-morrow."

"No need to wait till then; wear this to please me, and
let Marion's cipher signify that you are mine."

With a gravity that touched her more than the bestowal
of so dear a relic, Moor unslung a signet ring from his
watchguard, and with some difficulty pressed it to its
place on Sylvia's finger, a most effectual keeper for that
other ring whose tenure seemed so slight. She shrunk a
little and glanced up at him, because his touch was more
firm than tender, and his face wore a masterful expression
seldom seen there; for instinct, subtler than perception,
prompted both act and aspect. Then her eye fell and fixed
upon the dark stone with the single letter engraved upon
its tiny oval, and to her it took a double significance as her
husband held it there, claiming her again, with that emphatic
"Mine." She did not speak, but something in her
manner caused the fold between his brows to smooth itself
away as he regarded the small hand lying passively in his,
and said, half playfully, half earnestly       

"Forgive me if I hurt you, but you know my wooing is
not over yet; and till you love me with a perfect love I cannot
feel that my wife is wholly mine."[187]

"I am so young, you know; when I am a woman grown
I can give you a woman's love; now it is a girl's, you say.
Wait for me, Geoffrey, a little longer, for indeed I do my
best to be all you would have me."

Something brought tears into her eyes and made her lips
tremble, but in a breath the smile came back, and she added
gayly       

"How can I help being grave sometimes, and getting
thin, with so many housekeeping cares upon my shoulders,
and such an exacting, tyrannical husband to wear upon my
nerves. Don't I look like the most miserable of wives?"

She did not certainly as she shook the popper laughingly,
and looked over her shoulder at him, with the bloom of fire-light
on her cheeks, its cheerfulness in her eyes.

"Keep that expression for every day wear, and I am
satisfied. I want no tame Griselda, but the little girl who
once said she was always happy with me. Assure me of
that, and, having won my Leah, I can work and wait still
longer for my Rachel. Bless the baby! what has she done
to herself now?"

Tilly had retired behind the sofa, after she had swarmed
over every chair and couch, examined everything within her
reach, on étagère and table, embraced the Hebe in the corner,
played a fantasia on the piano, and choked herself with
the stopper of the odor bottle. A doleful wail betrayed
her hiding place, and she now emerged with a pair of nutcrackers,
ditto of pinched fingers, and an expression of
great mental and bodily distress. Her woes vanished instantaneously,
however, when the feast was announced, and
she performed an unsteady pas seul about the banquet,
varied by skirmishes with her long night-gown and darts at
any unguarded viand that tempted her.[188]

No ordinary table service would suit the holders of this
fireside fête. The corn was heaped in a bronze urn, the
nuts in a graceful basket, the apples lay on a plate of curiously
ancient china, and the water turned to wine through
the medium of a purple flagon of Bohemian glass. The
refection was spread upon the rug as on a flowery table, and
all the lustres were lighted, filling the room with a festal
glow. Prue would have held up her hands in dismay, like
the benighted piece of excellence she was, but Mark would
have enjoyed the picturesque group and sketched a mate to
the Golden Wedding. For Moor, armed with the wooden
fork, did the honors; Sylvia, leaning on her arm, dropped
corn after corn into a baby mouth that bird-like always
gaped for more; and Tilly lay luxuriously between them,
warming her little feet as she ate and babbled to the flames.

The clock was on the stroke of eight, the revel at its
height, when the door opened and a servant announced       

"Miss Dane and Mr. Warwick."

An impressive pause followed, broken by a crow from
Tilly, who seized this propitious moment to bury one hand
in the nuts and with the other capture the big red apple
which had been denied her. The sound seemed to dissipate
the blank surprise that had fallen on all parties, and
brought both host and hostess to their feet, the former exclaiming,
heartily       

"Welcome, friends, to a modern saturnalia and the bosom
of the Happy Family!"

"I fear you did not expect me so late," said Miss Dane.
"I was detained at the time fixed upon and gave it up, but
Mr. Warwick came, and we set off together. Pray don't
disturb yourselves, but let us enjoy the game with you."

"You and Adam are guests who never come too early or[189]
too late. We are playing children to-night, so just put
yourselves back a dozen years and let us all be merry together.
Sylvia, this our cousin, Faith here is your new
kinswoman. Please love one another as little people are
commanded to do."

A short stir ensued while hands were shaken, wraps put
off, and some degree of order restored to the room, then
they all sat down and began to talk. With well bred oblivion
of the short gown and long braids of her bashful-looking
hostess, Miss Dane suggested and discussed various
subjects of mutual interest, while Sylvia tried to keep her
eyes from wandering to the mirror opposite, which reflected
the figures of her husband and his friend.

Warwick sat erect in the easy-chair, for he never lounged;
and Moor, still supporting his character, was perched upon
the arm, talking with boyish vivacity. Every sense being
unwontedly alert, Sylvia found herself listening to both
guests at once, and bearing her own part in one conversation
so well that occasional lapses were only attributed to
natural embarrassment. What she and Miss Dane said she
never remembered; what the other pair talked of she never
forgot. The first words she caught were her husband's.

"You see I have begun to live for myself, Adam."

"I also see that it agrees with you excellently."

"Better than with you, for you are not looking like your
old self, though June made you happy, I hope?"

"If freedom is happiness it did."

"Are you still alone?"

"More so than ever."

Sylvia lost the next words, for a look showed her Moor's
hand on Adam's shoulder, and that for the first time within
her memory Warwick did not meet his friend's glance with[190]
one as open, but bent his eyes upon the ground, while his
hand went to and fro across his lips as if to steady them.
It was a gesture she remembered well, for though self-control
could keep the eye clear, the voice firm, that half-hidden
mouth of his sometimes rebelled and grew tremulous as a
woman's. The sight and the answer set her heart beating
with the thought, "Why has he come?" The repetition
of a question by Miss Dane recalled her from a dangerous
memory, and when that friendly lady entered upon another
long sentence to relieve her young hostess, she heard Moor
say       

"You have had too much solitude, Adam; I am sure of
it, for no man can live long alone and not get the uncanny
look you have. What have you been at?"

"Fighting the old fight with this unruly self of mine,
and getting ready for another tussle with the Adversary, in
whatever shape he may appear."

"And now you are come to your friend for the social
solace which the haughtiest heart hungers for when most
alone. You shall have it. Stay with us, Adam, and remember
that whatever changes come to me my home is
always yours."

"I know it, Geoffrey. I wanted to see your happiness
before I go away again, and should like to stay with
you a day or so if you are sure that       that she would
like it."

Moor laughed and pulled a lock of the brown mane, as
if to tease the lion into a display of the spirit he seemed
to have lost.

"How shy you are of speaking the new name! 'She'
will like it, I assure you, for she makes my friends hers.
Sylvia, come here, and tell Adam he is welcome; he dares[191]
to doubt it. Come and talk over old times, while I do the
same with Faith."

She went, trembling inwardly, but outwardly composed,
for she took refuge in one of those commonplace acts which
in such moments we gladly perform, and bless in our secret
souls. She had often wondered where they would next
meet, and how she should comport herself at such a trying
time. She had never imagined that he would come in this
way, or that a hearth-brush would save her from the
betrayal of emotion. So it was, however, and an involuntary
smile passed over her face as she managed to say
quite naturally, while brushing the nutshells tidily out of
sight       

"You know you are always welcome, Mr. Warwick.
'Adam's Room,' as we call it, is always ready, and
Geoffrey was wishing for you only yesterday."

"I am sure of his satisfaction at my coming, can I be
equally sure of yours. May I, ought I to stay?"

He leaned forward as he spoke, with an eager yet submissive
look, that Sylvia dared not meet, and in her anxiety
to preserve her self-possession, she forgot that to this listener
every uttered word became a truth, because his own were
always so.

"Why not, if you can bear our quiet life, for we are
a Darby and Joan already, though we do not look so to-night,
I acknowledge."

Men seldom understand the subterfuges women instinctively
use to conceal many a natural emotion which they are
not strong enough to control, not brave enough to confess.
To Warwick, Sylvia seemed almost careless, her words a
frivolous answer to the real meaning of his question, her
smile one of tranquil welcome. Her manner wrought an[192]
instant change in him, and when he spoke again he was the
Warwick of a year ago.

"I hesitated, Mrs. Moor, because I have sometimes heard
young wives complain that their husbands' friends were
marplots, and I have no desire to be one."

This speech, delivered with frosty gravity, made Sylvia
as cool and quiet as itself. She put her ally down, looked
full at Warwick, and said with a blending of dignity and
cordiality which even the pinafore could not destroy       

"Please to consider yourself a specially invited guest,
now and always. Never hesitate, but come and go as freely
as you used to do, for nothing need be changed between us
three because two of us have one home to offer you."

"Thanks; and now that the hearth is scrupulously clean
may I offer you a chair?"

The old keenness was in his eye, the old firmness about
the mouth, the old satirical smile on his lips as Warwick
presented the seat, with an inclination that to her seemed
ironical. She sat down, but when she cast about her mind
for some safe and easy topic to introduce, every idea had
fled; even memory and fancy turned traitors; not a lively
sally could be found, not a pleasant remembrance returned
to help her, and she sat dumb. Before the dreadful pause
grew awkward, however, rescue came in the form of Tilly.
Nothing daunted by the severe simplicity of her attire she
planted herself before Warwick, and shaking her hair out
of her eyes stared at him with an inquiring glance and
cheeks as red as her apple. She seemed satisfied in a
moment, and climbing to his knee established herself there,
coolly taking possession of his watch, and examining the
brown beard curiously as it parted with the white flash of
teeth, when Warwick smiled his warmest smile.[193]

"This recalls the night you fed the sparrow in your
hand. Do you remember, Adam?" and Sylvia looked and
spoke like her old self again.

"I seldom forget anything. But pleasant as that hour
was this is more to me, for the bird flew away, the baby
stays and gives me what I need."

He wrapt the child closer in his arms, leaned his dark
head on the bright one, and took the little feet into his
hand with a fatherly look that caused Tilly to pat his
cheek and begin an animated recital of some nursery
legend, which ended in a sudden gape, reminding Sylvia
that one of her guests was keeping late hours.

"What comes next?" asked Warwick.

"Now I lay me and byelow in the trib," answered Tilly,
stretching herself over his arm with a great yawn.

Warwick kissed the rosy half-open mouth and seemed
loth to part with the pious baby, for he took the shawl
Sylvia brought and did up the drowsy bundle himself.
While so busied she stole a furtive glance at him, having
looked without seeing before. Thinner and browner, but
stronger than ever was the familiar face she saw, yet
neither sad nor stern, for the grave gentleness which had
been a fugitive expression before now seemed habitual.
This, with the hand at the lips and the slow dropping of
the eyes, were the only tokens of the sharp experience he
had been passing through. Born for conflict and endurance,
he seemed to have manfully accepted the sweet uses
of adversity and grown the richer for his loss.

Those who themselves are quick to suffer, are also quick
to see the marks of suffering in others; that hasty scrutiny
assured Sylvia of all she had yearned to know, yet wrung
her heart with a pity the deeper for its impotence. Tilly's[194]
heavy head drooped between her bearer and the light as
they left the room, but in the dusky hall a few hot tears
fell on the baby's hair, and her new nurse lingered long
after the lullaby was done. When she reappeared the
girlish dress was gone, and she was Madam Moor again, as
her husband called her when she assumed her stately air.
All smiled at the change, but he alone spoke of it.

"I win the applause, Sylvia; for I sustain my character
to the end, while you give up before the curtain falls. You
are not so good an actress as I thought you."

Sylvia's smile was sadder than her tears as she briefly
answered       

"No, I find I cannot be a child again."




CHAPTER XV.

EARLY AND LATE.


One of Sylvia's first acts when she rose was most significant.[195]
She shook down her abundant hair, carefully
arranged a part in thick curls over cheeks and forehead,
gathered the rest into its usual coil, and said to herself, as
she surveyed her face half hidden in the shining cloud       

"It looks very sentimental, and I hate the weakness that
drives me to it, but it must be done, because my face is such
a traitor. Poor Geoffrey! he said I was no actress; I am
learning fast."

Why every faculty seemed sharpened, every object assumed
an unwonted interest, and that quiet hour possessed
an excitement that made her own room and countenance
look strange to her, she would not ask herself, as she paused
on the threshold of the door to ascertain if her guests were
stirring. Nothing was heard but the sound of regular footfalls
on the walk before the door, and with an expression of
relief she slowly went down. Moor was taking his morning
walk bareheaded in the sun. Usually Sylvia ran to join
him, but now she stood musing on the steps, until he saw
and came to her. As he offered the flower always ready
for her, he said smiling       

"Did the play last night so captivate you, that you go
back to the curls, because you cannot keep the braids?"[196]

"A sillier whim than that, even. I am afraid of those
two people; and as I am so quick to show my feelings in
my face, I intend to hide behind this veil if I get shy or
troubled. Did you think I could be so artful?"

"Your craft amazes me. But, dearest child, you need
not be afraid of Faith and Adam. Both already love you
for my sake, and soon will for your own. Both are so much
older, that they can easily overlook any little short-coming,
in consideration of your youth. Sylvia, I want to tell you
something about Adam. I never spoke of it before, because,
although no promise of silence was asked or given,
I knew he considered it a confidence. Now that it is all
over, I know that I may tell my wife, and she will help me
comfort him."

"Tell on, Geoffrey, I hear you."

"Well, dear, when we went gypsying long ago, on the
night you and Adam lost the boat, as I sat drying your
boots, and privately adoring them in spite of the mud, I
made a discovery. Adam loved, was on some sort of probation,
and would be married in June. He was slow to speak
of it, but I understood, and last night when I went to his
room with him, I asked how he had fared. Sylvia, it would
have made your heart ache to have seen his face, as he said
in that brief way of his       'Geoffrey, the woman I loved is
married, ask me nothing more.' I never shall; but I know,
by the change I see in him, that the love was very dear, the
wound very deep."

"Poor Adam! how can we help him?"

"Let him do as he likes. I will take him to his old
haunts, and busy him with my affairs till he forgets his
own. In the evenings we will have Prue, Mark, and Jessie
over here, will surround him with social influences, and[197]
make the last hours of the day the cheerfullest; then he
won't lie awake and think all night, as I suspect he has been
doing of late. Sylvia, I should like to see that woman;
though I could find it in my heart to hate her for her perfidy
to such a man."

Sylvia's head was bent as if to inhale the sweetness of
the flower she held, and all her husband saw was the bright
hair blowing in the wind.

"I pity her for her loss as well as hate her. Now, let
us talk of something else, or my tell-tale face will betray
that we have been talking of him, when we meet Adam."

They did so, and when Warwick put up his curtain, the
first sight he saw, was his friend walking with his young
wife under the red-leaved maples, in the sunshine. The
look Moor had spoken of, came into his eyes, darkening
them with the shadow of despair. A moment it gloomed
there, then passed, for Honor said reproachfully to Love       
"They are happy, should not that content you?"

"It shall!" answered the master of both, as he dropped
the curtain and turned away.

In pursuance of his kindly plan, Moor took Adam out
for a long tramp soon after breakfast, and Sylvia and Miss
Dane sat down to sew. In the absence of the greater fear,
Sylvia soon forgot the lesser one, and began to feel at ease
to study her new relative and covet her esteem.

Faith was past thirty, shapely and tall, with much natural
dignity of carriage, and a face never beautiful, but always
singularly attractive from its mild and earnest
character. Looking at her, one felt assured that here was
a right womanly woman, gentle, just, and true; possessed of
a well-balanced mind, a self-reliant soul, and that fine gift
which is so rare, the power of acting as a touchstone to all[198]
who approached, forcing them to rise or fall to their true
level, unconscious of the test applied. Her presence was
comfortable, her voice had motherly tones in it, her eyes a
helpful look. Even the soft hue of her dress, the brown
gloss of her hair, the graceful industry of her hands, had
their attractive influence. Sylvia saw and felt these things
with the quickness of her susceptible temperament, and
found herself so warmed and won, that soon it cost her an
effort to withhold anything that tried or troubled her, for
Faith was a born consoler, and Sylvia's heart was full.

However gloomy her day might have been she always
brightened in the evening as naturally as moths begin to
flutter when candles come. On the evening of this day the
friendly atmosphere about her, and the excitement of Warwick's
presence so affected her, that though the gayety of
girlhood was quite gone she looked as softly brilliant as
some late flower that has gathered the summer to itself
and gives it out again in the bloom and beauty of a single
hour.

When tea was over, for heroes and heroines must eat if
they are to do anything worth the paper on which their
triumphs and tribulations are recorded, the women gathered
about the library table, work in hand, as female tongues go
easier when their fingers are occupied. Sylvia left Prue
and Jessie to enjoy Faith, and while she fabricated some
trifle with scarlet silk and an ivory shuttle, she listened to
the conversation of the gentlemen who roved about the room
till a remark of Prue's brought the party together.

"Helen Chesterfield has run away from her husband in
the most disgraceful manner."

Mark and Moor drew near, Adam leaned on the chimney-piece,
the workers paused, and having produced her sensa[199]tion,
Prue proceeded to gratify their curiosity as briefly as
possible, for all knew the parties in question and all waited
anxiously to hear particulars.

"She married a Frenchman old enough to be her father,
but very rich. She thought she loved him, but when she
got tired of her fine establishment, and the novelties of
Paris, she found she did not, and was miserable. Many of
her new friends had lovers, so why should not she; and
presently she began to amuse herself with this Louis
Gustave Isadore Theodule de Roueville       There's a name
for a Christian man! Well, she began in play, grew in
earnest, and when she could bear her domestic trouble no
longer she just ran away, ruining herself for this life, and
really I don't know but for the next also."

"Poor soul! I always thought she was a fool, but upon
my word I pity her," said Mark.

"Remember she was very young, so far away from her
mother, with no real friend to warn and help her, and love
is so sweet. No wonder she went."

"Sylvia, how can you excuse her in that way? She
should have done her duty whether she loved the old
gentleman or not, and kept her troubles to herself in a
proper manner. You young girls think so much of love, so
little of moral obligations, decorum, and the opinions of the
world, you are not fit judges of the case. Mr. Warwick
agrees with me, I am sure."

"Not in the least."

"Do you mean to say that Helen should have left her
husband?"

"Certainly, if she could not love him."

"Do you also mean to say that she did right to run off
with that Gustave Isadore Theodule creature?"[200]

"By no means. It is worse than folly to attempt the
righting of one wrong by the commission of another."

"Then what in the world should she have done?"

"She should have honestly decided which she loved, have
frankly told the husband the mistake both had made, and
demanded her liberty. If the lover was worthy, have
openly married him and borne the world's censures. If
not worthy, have stood alone, an honest woman in God's
eyes, whatever the blind world might have thought."

Prue was scandalized to the last degree, for with her
marriage was more a law than a gospel; a law which ordained
that a pair once yoked should abide by their bargain,
be it good or ill, and preserve the proprieties in public no
matter how hot a hell their home might be for them and
for their children.

"What a dreadful state society would be in if your ideas
were adopted! People would constantly be finding out
that they were mismatched, and go running about as if
playing that game where every one changes places. I'd
rather die at once than live to see such a state of things as
that," said the worthy spinster.

"So would I, and recommend prevention rather than a
dangerous cure."

"I really should like to hear your views, Mr. Warwick,
for you quite take my breath away."

Much to Sylvia's surprise Adam appeared to like the
subject, and placed his views at Prue's disposal with
alacrity.

"I would begin at the beginning, and teach young people
that marriage is not the only aim and end of life, yet would
fit them for it, as for a sacrament too high and holy to be
profaned by a light word or thought. Show them how to[201]
be worthy of it and how to wait for it. Give them a law of
life both cheerful and sustaining; a law that shall keep them
hopeful if single, sure that here or hereafter they will find
that other self and be accepted by it; happy if wedded, for
their own integrity of heart will teach them to know the
true god when he comes, and keep them loyal to the last."

"That is all very excellent and charming, but what are
the poor souls to do who haven't been educated in this
fine way?" asked Prue.

"Unhappy marriages are the tragedies of our day, and
will be, till we learn that there are truer laws to be obeyed
than those custom sanctions, other obstacles than inequalities
of fortune, rank, and age. Because two persons love,
it is not always safe or wise for them to marry, nor need
it necessarily wreck their peace to live apart. Often what
seems the best affection of our hearts does more for us by
being thwarted than if granted its fulfilment and prove a
failure which embitters two lives instead of sweetening one."

He paused there, but Prue wanted a clearer answer, and
turned to Faith, sure that the woman would take her own
view of the matter.

"Which of us is right, Miss Dane, in Helen's case?"

"I cannot venture to judge the young lady, knowing so
little of her character or the influences that have surrounded
her, and believing that a certain divine example is best
for us to follow at such times. I agree with Mr. Warwick,
but not wholly, for his summary mode of adjustment would
not be quite just nor right in all cases. If both find that
they do not love, the sooner they part the wiser; if one
alone makes the discovery the case is sadder still, and
harder for either to decide. But as I speak from observation
only my opinions are of little worth."[202]

"Of great worth, Miss Dane; for to women like yourself
observation often does the work of experience, and despite
your modesty I wait to hear the opinions."

Warwick spoke, and spoke urgently, for the effect of all
this upon Sylvia was too absorbing a study to be relinquished
yet. As he turned to her, Faith gave him an
intelligent glance, and answered like one speaking with
intention and to some secret but serious issue       

"You shall have them. Let us suppose that Helen was
a woman possessed of a stronger character, a deeper nature;
the husband a younger, nobler man; the lover truly
excellent, and above even counselling the step this pair have
taken. In a case like that the wife, having promised to
guard another's happiness, should sincerely endeavor to do
so, remembering that in making the joy of others we often
find our own, and that having made so great a mistake the
other should not bear all the loss. If there be a strong
attachment on the husband's part, and he a man worthy of
affection and respect, who has given himself confidingly,
believing himself beloved by the woman he so loves, she
should leave no effort unmade, no self-denial unexacted,
till she has proved beyond all doubt that it is impossible to
be a true wife. Then, and not till then, has she the right
to dissolve the tie that has become a sin, because where no
love lives inevitable suffering and sorrow enter in, falling
not only upon guilty parents, but the innocent children
who may be given them."

"And the lover, what of him?" asked Adam, still intent
upon his purpose, for, though he looked steadily at
Faith, he knew that Sylvia drove the shuttle in and out
with a desperate industry that made her silence significant
to him.[203]

"I would have the lover suffer and wait; sure that, however
it may fare with him, he will be the richer and the
better for having known the joy and pain of love."

"Thank you." And to Mark's surprise Warwick bowed
gravely, and Miss Dane resumed her work with a preoccupied
air.

"Well, for a confirmed celibate, it strikes me you take a
remarkable interest in matrimony," said Mark. "Or is it
merely a base desire to speculate upon the tribulations of
your fellow-beings, and congratulate yourself upon your
escape from them?"

"Neither; I not only pity and long to alleviate them,
but have a strong desire to share them, and the wish
and purpose of my life for the last year has been to
marry."

Outspoken as Warwick was at all times and on all subjects,
there was something in this avowal that touched
those present, for with the words a quick rising light and
warmth illuminated his whole countenance, and the energy
of his desire tuned his voice to a key which caused one
heart to beat fast, one pair of eyes to fill with sudden tears.
Moor could not see his friend's face, but he saw Mark's,
divined the indiscreet inquiry hovering on his lips, and
arrested it with a warning gesture.

A pause ensued, during which each person made some
mental comment on the last speech, and to several of the
group that little moment was a memorable one. Remembering
the lost love Warwick had confessed to him, Moor
thought with friendliest regret       "Poor Adam, he finds it
impossible to forget." Reading the truth in the keen delight
the instant brought her, Sylvia cried out within herself,
"Oh, Geoffrey, forgive me, for I love him!" and[204]
Warwick whispered to that impetuous heart of his, "Be
still, we have ventured far enough."

Prue spoke first, very much disturbed by having her
prejudices and opinions opposed, and very anxious to prove
herself in the right.

"Mark and Geoffrey look as if they agreed with Mr.
Warwick in his       excuse me if I say, dangerous ideas; but
I fancy the personal application of them would change their
minds. Now, Mark, just look at it; suppose some one of
Jessie's lovers should discover an affinity for her, and she
for him, what would you do?"

"Shoot him or myself, or all three, and make a neat
little tragedy of it."

"There is no getting a serious answer from you, and I
wonder I ever try. Geoffrey, I put the case to you; if
Sylvia should find she adored Julian Haize, who fell sick
when she was married, you know, and should inform you
of that agreeable fact some fine day, should you think it
quite reasonable and right to say, 'Go, my dear, I'm very
sorry, but it can't be helped.'"

The way in which Prue put the case made it impossible
for her hearers not to laugh. But Sylvia held her breath
while waiting for her husband's answer. He was standing
behind her chair, and spoke with the smile still on his lips,
too confident to harbor even a passing fancy.

"Perhaps I ought to be generous enough to do so, but
not being a Jaques, with a convenient glacier to help me
out of the predicament, I am afraid I should be hard to
manage. I love but few, and those few are my world; so
do not try me too hardly, Sylvia."

"I shall do my best, Geoffrey."

She dropped her shuttle as she spoke, and stooping to[205]
pick it up, down swept the long curls over either cheek;
thus, when she fell to work again, nothing of her face was
visible but a glimpse of forehead, black lashes and faintly
smiling mouth. Moor led the conversation to other topics,
and was soon deep in an art discussion with Mark and Miss
Dane, while Prue and Jessie chatted away on that safe subject,
dress. But Sylvia worked silently, and Warwick still
leaned there watching the busy hand as if he saw something
more than a pretty contrast between the white fingers
and the scarlet silk.

When the other guests had left, and Faith and himself
had gone to their rooms, Warwick, bent on not passing another
sleepless night full of unprofitable longings, went
down again to get a book. The library was still lighted,
and standing there alone he saw Sylvia, wearing an expression
that startled him. Both hands pushed back and held
her hair away as if she scorned concealment from herself.
Her eyes seemed fixed with a despairing glance on some invisible
disturber of her peace. All the light and color
that made her beautiful were gone, leaving her face worn
and old, and the language of both countenance and attitude
was that of one suddenly confronted with some hard fact,
some heavy duty, that must be accepted and performed.

This revelation lasted but a moment, Moor's step came
down the hall, the hair fell, the anguish passed, and nothing
but a wan and weary face remained. But Warwick
had seen it, and as he stole away unperceived he pressed
his hands together, saying mournfully within himself, "I
was mistaken. God help us all."




CHAPTER XVI.

IN THE TWILIGHT.


If Sylvia needed another trial to make that hard week[206]
harder, it soon came to her in the knowledge that Warwick
watched her. She well knew why, and vainly endeavored
to conceal from him that which she had succeeded in concealing
entirely from others. But he possessed the key to
her variable moods; he alone knew that now painful forethought,
not caprice dictated many of her seeming whims,
and ruled her simplest action. To others she appeared busy,
gay, and full of interest in all about her; to him, the industry
was a preventive of forbidden thoughts; the gayety a
daily endeavor to forget; the interest, an anxiety concerning
the looks and words of her companions, because she must
guard her own.

Sylvia felt something like terror in the presence of this
penetrating eye, this daring will, for the vigilance was unflagging
and unobtrusive, and with all her efforts she could
not read his heart as she felt her own was being read.
Adam could act no part, but bent on learning the truth
for the sake of all, he surmounted the dangers of the situation
by no artifice, no rash indulgence, but by simply shunning
solitary interviews with Sylvia as carefully as the
courtesy due his hostess would allow. In walks and drives,
and general conversation, he bore his part, surprising and[207]
delighting those who knew him best by the genial change
which seemed to have softened his rugged nature. But the
instant the family group fell apart and Moor's devotion to
his cousin left Sylvia alone, Warwick was away into the
wood or out upon the sea, lingering there till some meal,
some appointed pleasure, or the evening lamp brought all
together. Sylvia understood this, and loved him for it even
while she longed to have it otherwise. But Moor reproached
him for his desertion, doubly felt since the gentler acquirements
made him dearer to his friend. Hating all
disguises, Warwick found it hard to withhold the fact
which was not his own to give, and sparing no blame to
himself, answered Moor's playful complaint with a sad
sincerity that freed him from all further pleadings.

"Geoffrey, I have a heavy heart which even you cannot
heal. Leave it to time, and let me come and go as of old,
enjoying the social hour when I may, flying to solitude
when I must."

Much as Sylvia had longed to see these friends, she
counted the hours of their stay, for the presence of one was
a daily disquieting, because spirits would often flag, conversation
fail, and an utter weariness creep over her when
she could least account for or yield to it. More than once
during that week she longed to lay her head on Faith's
kind bosom and ask help. Deep as was her husband's love
it did not possess the soothing power of a woman's sympathy,
and though it cradled her as tenderly as if she had
been a child, Faith's compassion would have been like
motherly arms to fold and foster. But friendly as they
soon became, frank as was Faith's regard for Sylvia, earnest
as was Sylvia's affection for Faith, she never seemed
to reach that deeper place where she desired to be. Always[208]
when she thought she had found the innermost that each of
us seek for in our friend, she felt that Faith drew back,
and a reserve as delicate as inflexible barred her approach
with chilly gentleness. This seemed so foreign to Faith's
nature that Sylvia pondered and grieved over it till the
belief came to her that this woman, so truly excellent and
loveworthy, did not desire to receive her confidence, and
sometimes a bitter fear assailed her that Warwick was not
the only reader of her secret trouble.

All things have an end, and the last day came none too
soon for one dweller under that hospitable roof. Faith
refused all entreaties to stay, and looked somewhat anxiously
at Warwick as Moor turned from herself to him with the
same urgency.

"Adam, you will stay? Promise me another week?"

"I never promise, Geoffrey."

Believing that, as no denial came, his request was granted,
Moor gave his whole attention to Faith, who was to leave
them in an hour.

"Sylvia, while I help our cousin to select and fasten up
the books and prints she likes to take with her, will you
run down into the garden and fill your prettiest basket with
our finest grapes? You will like that better than fumbling
with folds and string; and you know one's servants should
not perform these pleasant services for one's best friends."

Glad to be away, Sylvia ran through the long grape
walk to its sunniest nook, and standing outside the arch,
began to lay the purple clusters in her basket. Only a
moment was she there alone; Warwick's shadow, lengthened
by the declining sun, soon fell black along the path. He
did not see her, nor seem intent on following her; he walked
slowly, hat in hand, so slowly that he was but midway down[209]
the leafy lane when Faith's voice arrested him. She was
in haste, as her hurried step and almost breathless words
betrayed; and losing not an instant, she cried before they
met       

"Adam, you will come with me? I cannot leave you
here."

"Do you doubt me, Faith?"

"No; but loving women are so weak."

"So strong, you mean; men are weakest when they
love."

"Adam, will you come?"

"I will follow you; I shall speak with Geoffrey first."

"Must you tell him so soon?"

"I must."

Faith's hand had been on Warwick's arm; as he spoke
the last words she bent her head upon it for an instant,
then without another word turned and hurried back as
rapidly as she had come, while Warwick stood where she left
him, motionless as if buried in some absorbing thought.

All had passed in a moment, a moment too short, too full
of intense surprise to leave Sylvia time for recollection and
betrayal of her presence. Half hidden and wholly unobserved
she had seen the unwonted agitation of Faith's
countenance and manner, had heard Warwick's softly spoken
answers to those eager appeals, and with a great pang had
discovered that some tender confidence existed between these
two of which she had never dreamed. Sudden as the discovery
was its acceptance and belief; for, knowing her own
weakness, Sylvia found something like relief in the hope
that a new happiness for Warwick had ended all temptation,
and in time perhaps all pain for herself. Impulsive as ever
she leaned upon the seeming truth, and making of the fancy[210]
a fact, passed into a perfect passion of self-abnegation,
thinking, in the brief pause that followed Faith's departure       

"This is the change we see in him; this made him watch
me, hoping I had forgotten, as I once said and believed. I
should be glad, I will be glad, and let him see that even
while I suffer I can rejoice in that which helps us both."

Full of her generous purpose, yet half doubtful how to
execute it, Sylvia stepped from the recess where she had
stood, and slowly passed toward Warwick, apparently intent
on settling her fruity burden as she went. At the
first sound of her light step on the gravel he turned, feeling
at once that she must have heard, and eager to learn what
significance that short dialogue possessed for her. Only a
hasty glance did she give him as she came, but it showed
him flushed cheeks, excited eyes, and lips a little tremulous
as they said       

"These are for Faith; will you hold the basket while I
cover it with leaves?"

He took it, and as the first green covering was deftly
laid, he asked, below his breath       

"Sylvia, did you hear us?"

To his unutterable amazement she looked up clearly, and
all her heart was in her voice, as she answered with a fervency
he could not doubt       

"Yes; and I was glad to hear, to know that a nobler
woman filled the place I cannot fill. Oh, believe it, Adam;
and be sure that the knowledge of your great content will
lighten the terrible regret which you have seen as nothing
else ever could have done."

Down fell the basket at their feet, and taking her face
between his hands, Warwick bent and searched with a glance[211]
that seemed to penetrate to her heart's core. For a moment
she struggled to escape, but the grasp that held her was
immovable. She tried to oppose a steadfast front and baffle
that perilous inspection, but quick and deep rushed the
traitorous color over cheek and forehead with its mute betrayal.
She tried to turn her eyes away, but those other eyes,
dark and dilated with intensity of purpose, fixed her own,
and the confronting countenance wore an expression which
made its familiar features look awfully large and grand to
her panic-stricken sight. A sense of utter helplessness fell
on her, courage deserted her, pride changed to fear, defiance
to despair; as the flush faded, the fugitive glance was arrested
and the upturned face became a pale blank, ready to receive
the answer that strong scrutiny was slowly bringing to the
light, as invisible characters start out upon a page when fire
passes over them. Neither spoke, but soon through all opposing
barriers the magnetism of an indomitable will drew
forth the truth, set free the captive passion pent so long,
and wrung from those reluctant lineaments a full confession
of that power which heaven has gifted with eternal youth.

The instant this assurance was his own beyond a doubt,
Warwick released her, snatched up his hat, and hurrying
down the path vanished in the wood. Spent as with an
hour's excitement, and bewildered by emotions which she
could no longer master, Sylvia lingered in the grape walk
till her husband called her. Then hastily refilling her
basket, she shook her hair about her face and went to bid
Faith good by. Moor was to accompany her to the city,
and they left early, that Faith might pause for adieux to
Mark and Prudence.

"Where is Adam? Has he gone before, or been inveigled
into staying?"[212]

Moor spoke to Sylvia, but busied in fastening the basket-lid,
she seemed not to hear, and Faith replied for her.

"He will take a later boat, we need not wait for him."

When Faith embraced Sylvia, all the coldness had melted
from her manner, and her voice was tender as a mother's as
she whispered low in her ear       

"Dear child, if ever you need any help that Geoffrey
cannot give, remember cousin Faith."

For two hours Sylvia sat alone, not idle, for in the first
real solitude she had enjoyed for seven days she looked
deeply into herself, and putting by all disguises owned the
truth, and resolved to repair the past if possible, as Faith
had counselled in the case which she had now made her
own. Like so many of us, Sylvia often saw her errors too
late to avoid committing them, and failing to do the right
thing at the right moment, kept herself forever in arrears
with that creditor who must inevitably be satisfied. She
had been coming to this decision all that weary week, and
these quiet hours left her both resolute and resigned.

As she sat there while the early twilight began to gather,
her eye often turned to Warwick's travelling bag, which
Faith, having espied it ready in his chamber, had brought
down and laid in the library, as a reminder of her wish.
As she looked at it, Sylvia's heart yearned toward it in the
fond, foolish way which women have of endowing the possessions
of those they love with the attractions of sentient
things, and a portion of their owner's character or claim
upon themselves. It was like Warwick, simple and strong,
no key, and every mark of the long use which had tested
its capabilities and proved them durable. A pair of gloves
lay beside it on the chair, and though she longed to touch
anything of his, she resisted the temptation till, pausing[213]
near them in one of her journeys to the window, she saw a
rent in the glove that lay uppermost,       that appeal was
irresistible,       "Poor Adam! there has been no one to care
for him so long, and Faith does not yet know how; surely
I may perform so small a service for him if he never knows
how tenderly I do it?"

Standing ready to drop her work at a sound, Sylvia
snatched a brief satisfaction which solaced her more than
an hour of idle lamentation, and as she kissed the glove
with a long, sad kiss, and put it down with eyes that dimly
saw where it should be, perhaps there went as much real
love and sorrow into that little act as ever glorified some
greater deed. Then she went to lie in the "Refuge," as
she had named an ancient chair, with her head on its embracing
arm. Not weeping, but quietly watching the flicker
of the fire, which filled the room with warm duskiness,
making the twilight doubly pleasant, till a sudden blaze
leaped up, showing her that her watch was over and Warwick
come. She had not heard him enter, but there he was
close before her, his face glowing with the frosty air, his
eye clear and kind, and in his aspect that nameless charm
which won for him the confidence of whosoever read his countenance.
Scarce knowing why, Sylvia felt reassured that
all was well, and looked up with more welcome in her heart
than she dared betray in words.

"Come at last! where have you been so long, Adam?"

"Round the Island I suspect, for I lost my way, and had
no guide but instinct to lead me home again. I like to say
that word, for though it is not home it seems so to me now.
May I sit here before I go, and warm myself at your fire,
Sylvia?"

Sure of his answer he established himself on the stool at[214]
her feet, stretched his hands to the grateful blaze, and went
on with some inward resolution lending its power and depth
to his voice.

"I had a question to settle with myself and went to find
my best counsellors in the wood. Often when I am harassed
by some perplexity or doubt to which I can find no
wise or welcome answer, I walk myself into a belief that it
will come; then it appears. I stoop to break a handsome
flower, to pick up a cone, or watch some little creature happier
than I, and there lies my answer, like a good luck
penny, ready to my hand."

"Faith has gone, but Geoffrey hopes to keep you for
another week," said Sylvia, ignoring the unsafe topic.

"Shall he have his wish?"

"Faith expects you to follow her."

"And you think I ought?"

"I think you will."

"When does the next boat leave?"

"An hour hence."

"I'll wait for it here. Did I wake you coming in?"

"I was not asleep; only lazy, warm, and quiet."

"And deadly tired;       dear soul, how can it be otherwise,
leading the life you lead."

There was such compassion in his voice, such affection in
his eye, such fostering kindliness in the touch of the hand
he laid upon her own, that Sylvia cried within herself,       "Oh,
if Geoffrey would only come!" and hoping for that
help to save her from herself, she hastily replied       

"You are mistaken, Adam,       my life is easier than I
deserve,       my husband makes me very       "

"Miserable,       the truth to me, Sylvia."

Warwick rose as he spoke, closed the door and came back[215]
wearing an expression which caused her to start up with a
gesture of entreaty       

"No no, I will not hear you! Adam, you must not
speak!"

He paused opposite her, leaving a little space between
them, which he did not cross through all that followed, and
with that look, inflexible yet pitiful, he answered steadily       

"I must speak and you will hear me. But understand
me, Sylvia, I desire and design no French sentiment nor sin
like that we heard of, and what I say now I would say if
Geoffrey stood between us. I have settled this point after
long thought and the heartiest prayers I ever prayed; and
much as I have at stake, I speak more for your sake than
my own. Therefore do not entreat nor delay, but listen and
let me show you the wrong you are doing yourself, your
husband, and your friend."

"Does Faith know all the past? does she desire you to do
this that her happiness may be secure?" demanded Sylvia.

"Faith is no more to me, nor I to Faith, than the friendliest
regard can make us. She suspected that I loved you
long ago; she now believes that you love me; she pities
her cousin tenderly, but will not meddle with the tangle we
have made of our three lives. Forget that folly, and let
me speak to you as I should. When we parted I thought
that you loved Geoffrey; so did you. When I came here
I was sure of it for a day; but on that second night I saw
your face as you stood here alone, and then I knew what I
have since assured myself of. God knows, I think my gain
dearly purchased by his loss. I see your double trial; I
know the tribulations in store for all of us; yet, as an
honest man, I must speak out, because you ought not to
delude yourself or Geoffrey another day."[216]

"What right have you to come between us and decide
my duty, Adam?" Sylvia spoke passionately, roused to
resistance by his manner and the turmoil of emotions warring
within her.

"The right of a sane man to save the woman he loves
from destroying her own peace forever, and undermining
the confidence of the friend dearest to them both. I know
this is not the world's way in such matters; but I care not;
because I believe one human creature has a right to speak
to another in times like these as if they two stood alone.
I will not command, I will appeal to you, and if you are
the candid soul I think you, your own words shall prove
the truth of what I say. Sylvia, do you love your husband?"

"Yes, Adam, dearly."

"More than you love me?"

"I wish I did! I wish I did!"

"Are you happy with him?"

"I was till you came; I shall be when you are gone."

"Never! It is impossible to go back to the blind tranquillity
you once enjoyed. Now a single duty lies before
you; delay is weak, deceit is wicked; utter sincerity
alone can help us. Tell Geoffrey all; then, whether you
live your life alone, or one day come to me, there is no
false dealing to repent of, and looking the hard fact in
the face robs it of one half its terrors. Will you do this,
Sylvia?"

"No, Adam. Remember what he said that night: 'I
love but few, and those few are my world,'       I am chief in
that world; shall I destroy it, for my selfish pleasure? He
waited for me very long, is waiting still; can I for a second
time disappoint the patient heart that would find it easier[217]
to give up life than the poor possession which I am? No,
I ought not, dare not do it yet."

"If you dare not speak the truth to your friend, you do
not deserve him, and the name is a lie. You ask me to remember
what he said that night,       I ask you to recall the
look with which he begged you not to try him too hardly.
Put it to yourself,       which is the kinder justice, a full confession
now, or a late one hereafter, when longer subterfuge
has made it harder for you to offer, bitterer for him to receive?
I tell you, Sylvia, it were more merciful to murder
him outright than to slowly wear away his faith, his peace,
and love by a vain endeavor to perform as a duty what
should be your sweetest pleasure, and what will soon become
a burden heavier than you can bear."

"You do not see as I see; you cannot understand what
I am to him, nor can I tell you what he is to me. It is
not as if I could dislike or despise him for any unworthiness
of his own; nor as if he were a lover only. Then I
could do much which now is worse than impossible, for
I have married him, and it is too late."

"Oh, Sylvia! why could you not have waited?"

"Why? because I am what I am, too easily led by circumstances,
too entirely possessed by whatever hope, belief,
or fear rules me for the hour. Give me a steadfast nature
like your own and I will be as strong. I know I am weak,
but I am not wilfully wicked; and when I ask you to be
silent, it is because I want to save him from the pain of
doubt, and try to teach myself to love him as I should. I
must have time, but I can bear much and endeavor more
persistently than you believe. If I forgot you once, can I
not again? and should I not? I am all in all to him,
while you, so strong, so self-reliant, can do without my love[218]
as you have done till now, and will soon outlive your sorrow
for the loss of that which might have made us happy had
I been more patient."

"Yes, I shall outlive it, else I should have little faith in
myself. But I shall not forget; and if you would remain
forever what you now are to me, you will so act that nothing
may mar this memory, if it is to be no more. I doubt your
power to forget an affection which has survived so many
changes and withstood assaults such as Geoffrey must unconsciously
have made upon it. But I have no right to
condemn your beliefs, to order your actions, or force you
to accept my code of morals if you are not ready for it.
You must decide, but do not again deceive yourself, and
through whatever comes hold fast to that which is better
worth preserving than husband, happiness, or friend."

His words fell cold on Sylvia's ear, for with the inconsistency
of a woman's heart she thought he gave her up too
readily, yet honored him more truly for sacrificing both
himself and her to the principle that ruled his life and
made him what he was. His seeming resignation steadied
her, for now he waited her decision, while before he was
only bent on executing the purpose wherein he believed salvation
lay. She girded up her strength, collected her
thoughts, and tried to show him what she believed to be
her duty.

"Let me tell you how it is with me, Adam, and be patient
if I am not wise and brave like you, but far too young,
too ignorant to bear such troubles well. I am not leaning
on my own judgment now, but on Faith's, and though you
do not love her as I hoped, you feel she is one to trust. She
said the wife, in that fictitious case which was so real to us,
the wife should leave no effort unmade, no self-denial[219]
unexacted, till she had fairly proved that she could not be
what she had promised. Then, and then only, had she a
right to undo the tie that had bound her. I must do this
before I think of your love or my own, for on my marriage
morning I made a vow within myself that Geoffrey's happiness
should be the first duty of my life. I shall keep that
vow as sacredly as I will those I made before the world,
until I find that it is utterly beyond my power, then I will
break all together."

"You have tried that once, and failed."

"No, I have never tried it as I shall now. At first, I
did not know the truth, then I was afraid to believe, and
struggled blindly to forget. Now I see clearly, I confess it,
I resolve to conquer it, and I will not yield until I have
done my best. You say you must respect me. Could you
do so if I no longer respected myself? I should not, if I
forgot all Geoffrey had borne and done for me, and could
not bear and do this thing for him. I must make the effort,
and make it silently; for he is very proud with all his gentleness,
and would reject the seeming sacrifice though he would
make one doubly hard for love of me. If I am to stay with
him, it spares him the bitterest pain he could suffer; if I am
to go, it gives him a few more months of happiness, and I
may so prepare him that the parting will be less hard.
How others would act I cannot tell, I only know that this
seems right to me; and I must fight my fight alone, even if
I die in doing it."

She was so earnest, yet so humble; so weak in all but
the desire to do well; so young to be tormented with such
fateful issues, and withal so steadfast in the grateful yet
remorseful tenderness she bore her husband, that though
sorely disappointed and not one whit convinced, Warwick[220]
could only submit to this woman-hearted child, and love
her with redoubled love, both for what she was and what
she aspired to be.

"Sylvia, what would you have me do?"

"You must go away, and for a long time, Adam; because
when you are near me my will is swayed by yours, and
what you desire I long to give you. Go quite away, and
through Faith you may learn whether I succeed or fail. It
is hard to say this, yet you know it is a truer hospitality
in me to send you from my door than to detain and offer
you temptation for your daily bread."

How strangely Ottila came back to him, and all the
scenes he had passed through with her!       a perilous contrast
just then. Yet, despite his pride in the loving little
creature who put him from her that she might be worthy of
him, one irrepressible lament swelled his heart and passed
his lips       

"Ah, Sylvia! I thought that parting on the mountain
was the hardest I could ever know, but this is harder; for
now I have but to say come to me, and you would come."

But the bitter moment had its drop of honey, whose
sweetness nourished him when all else failed. Sylvia
answered with a perfect confidence in that integrity which
even her own longing could not bribe       

"Yes, Adam, but you will not say it, because feeling as
I feel, you know I must not come to you."

He did know it, and confessed his submission by folding
fast the arms half opened for her, and standing dumb with
the words trembling on his lips. It was the bravest action
of a life full of real valor, for the sacrifice was not made
with more than human fortitude. The man's heart clamored
for its right, patience was weary, hope despaired, and all[221]
natural instincts mutinied against the command that bound
them. But no grain of virtue ever falls wasted to the
ground; it drops back upon its giver a regathered strength,
and cannot fail of its reward in some kindred soul's approval,
imitation, or delight. It was so then, as Sylvia went
to him; for though she did not touch nor smile upon him,
he felt her nearness; and the parting assured him that its
power bound them closer than the happiest union. In her
face there shone a look half fervent, half devout, and her
voice had no falter in it now.

"You show me what I should be. All my life I have
desired strength of heart and stability of soul; may I not
hope to earn for myself a little of the integrity I love in
you? If courage, self-denial, and self-help, make you
what you are, can I have a more effectual guide? You
say you shall outlive this passion; why should not I imitate
your brave example, and find the consolations you shall
find? Oh, Adam, let me try."

"You shall."

"Then go; go now, while I can say it as I should."

"The good Lord bless and help you, Sylvia."

She gave him both her hands, but though he only pressed
them silently, that pressure nearly destroyed the victory
she had won, for the strong grasp snapped the slender
guard-ring Moor had given her a week ago. She heard it
drop with a golden tinkle on the hearth, saw the dark
oval, with its doubly significant character, roll into the
ashes, and felt Warwick's hold tighten as if he echoed the
emphatic word uttered when the ineffectual gift was first
bestowed. Superstition flowed in Sylvia's blood, and was
as unconquerable as the imagination which supplied its
food. This omen startled her. It seemed a forewarning[222]
that endeavor would be vain, that submission was wisdom,
and that the husband's charm had lost its virtue when the
stronger power claimed her. The desire to resist began to
waver as the old passionate longing sprang up more eloquent
than ever; she felt the rush of a coming impulse, knew
that it would sweep her into Warwick's arms, there to
forget her duty, to forfeit his respect. With the last effort
of a sorely tried spirit she tore her hands away, fled up to
the room which had never needed lock or key till now, and
stifling the sound of those departing steps among the cushions
of the little couch where she had wept away childish
woes and dreamed girlish dreams, she struggled with the
great sorrow of her too early womanhood, uttering with
broken voice that petition oftenest quoted from the one
prayer which expresses all our needs       

"Lead me not into temptation, but deliver me from evil."




CHAPTER XVII.

ASLEEP AND AWAKE.


March winds were howling round the house, the clock[223]
was striking two, the library lamp still burned, and Moor
sat writing with an anxious face. Occasionally, he paused
to look backward through the leaves of the book in which
he wrote; sometimes he sat with suspended pen, thinking
deeply; and once or twice he laid it down, to press his hand
over eyes more weary than the mind that compelled them to
this late service.

Returning to his work after one of these pauses, he was a
little startled to see Sylvia standing on the threshold of the
door. Rising hastily to ask if she were ill, he stopped half
way across the room, for, with a thrill of apprehension and
surprise, he saw that she was asleep. Her eyes were open,
fixed and vacant, her face reposeful, her breathing regular,
and every sense apparently wrapt in the profoundest unconsciousness.
Fearful of awakening her too suddenly, Moor
stood motionless, yet full of interest, for this was his first
experience of somnambulism, and it was a strange, almost
an awful sight, to witness the blind obedience of the body
to the soul that ruled it.

For several minutes she remained where she first appeared.
Then, as if the dream demanded action, she stooped,
and seemed to take some object from a chair beside the door,[224]
held it an instant, kissed it softly and laid it down. Slowly
and steadily she went across the room, avoiding all obstacles
with the unerring instinct that often leads the sleepwalker
through dangers that appall his waking eyes, and sat
down in the great chair he had left, leaned her cheek upon
its arm, and rested tranquilly for several minutes. Soon
the dream disturbed her, and lifting her head, she bent forward,
as if addressing or caressing some one seated at her
feet. Involuntarily her husband smiled; for often when
they were alone he sat there reading or talking to her, while
she played with his hair, likening its brown abundance to
young Milton's curling locks in the picture overhead. The
smile had hardly risen when it was scared away, for Sylvia
suddenly sprung up with both hands out, crying in a voice
that rent the silence with its imploring energy       

"No, no, you must not speak! I will not hear you!"

Her own cry woke her. Consciousness and memory returned
together, and her face whitened with a look of terror,
as her bewildered eyes showed her not Warwick, but her
husband. This look, so full of fear, yet so intelligent,
startled Moor more than the apparition or the cry had
done, for a conviction flashed into his mind that some unsuspected
trouble had been burdening Sylvia, and was now
finding vent against her will. Anxious to possess himself
of the truth, and bent on doing so, he veiled his purpose
for a time, letting his unchanged manner reassure and compose
her.

"Dear child, don't look so lost and wild. You are quite
safe, and have only been wandering in your sleep. Why,
Mrs. Macbeth, have you murdered some one, that you go
crying out in this uncanny way, frightening me as much as
I seem to have frightened you?"[225]

"I have murdered sleep. What did I do? what did I
say?" she asked, trembling and shrinking as she dropped
into her chair.

Hoping to quiet her, he took his place on the footstool,
and told her what had passed. At first, she listened with a
divided mind, for so strongly was she still impressed with
the vividness of the dream, she half expected Warwick to
rise like Banquo, and claim the seat that a single occupancy
seemed to have made his own. An expression of intense
relief replaced that of fear, when she had heard all, and
she composed herself with the knowledge that her secret
was still hers. For, dreary bosom-guest as it was, she had
not yet resolved to end her trial.

"What set you walking, Sylvia?"

"I recollect hearing the clock strike one, and thinking I
would come down to see what you were doing so late, but
must have dropped off and carried out my design asleep.
You see I put on wrapper and slippers as I always do,
when I take nocturnal rambles awake. How pleasant the
fire feels, and how cosy you look here; no wonder you like
to stay and enjoy it."

She leaned forward warming her hands in unconscious
imitation of Adam, on the night which she had been recalling
before she slept. Moor watched her with increasing
disquiet; for never had he seen her in a mood like this.
She evaded his question, she averted her eyes, she half hid
her face, and with a gesture that of late had grown habitual,
seemed to try to hide her heart. Often had she baffled
him, sometimes grieved him, but never before showed that
she feared him. This wounded both his love and pride,
and this fixed his resolution, to wring from her an
explanation of the changes which had passed over her[226]
within those winter months, for they had been many and
mysterious. As if she feared silence, Sylvia soon spoke
again.

"Why are you up so late? This is not the first time I
have seen your lamp burning when I woke. What are you
studying so deeply?"

"My wife."

Leaning on the arm of her chair he looked up wistfully,
tenderly, as if inviting confidence, sueing for affection.
The words, the look, smote Sylvia to the heart, and but for
the thought, "I have not tried long enough," she would
have uttered the confession that leaped to her lips. Once
spoken, it would be too late for secret effort or success, and
this man's happiest hopes would vanish in a breath. Knowing
that his nature was almost as sensitively fastidious as a
woman's, she also knew that the discovery of her love for
Adam, innocent as it had been, self-denying as it tried to
be, would forever mar the beauty of his wedded life for
Moor. No hour of it would seem sacred, no act, look, or
word of hers entirely his own, nor any of the dear delights
of home remain undarkened by the shadow of his friend.
She could not speak yet, and turning her eyes to the fire,
she asked       

"Why study me? Have you no better book?"

"None that I love to read so well or have such need to
understand; because, though nearest and dearest as you are
to me, I seem to know you less than any friend I have. I
do not wish to wound you, dear, nor be exacting; but since
we were married you have grown more shy than ever, and
the act which should have drawn us tenderly together seems
to have estranged us. You never talk now of yourself, or
ask me to explain the working of that busy mind of yours;[227]
and lately you have sometimes shunned me, as if solitude
were pleasanter than my society. Is it, Sylvia?"

"Sometimes; I always liked to be alone, you know."

She answered as truly as she could, feeling that his love
demanded every confidence but the one cruel one which
would destroy its peace past help.

"I knew I had a most tenacious heart, but I hoped it
was not a selfish one," he sorrowfully said. "Now I see
that it is, and deeply regret that my hopeful spirit, my impatient
love, has brought disappointment to us both. I
should have waited longer, should have been less confident
of my own power to win you, and never let you waste your
life in vain endeavors to be happy when I was not all to you
that you expected. I should not have consented to your
wish to spend the winter here so much alone with me. I
should have known that such a quiet home and studious
companion could not have many charms for a young girl
like you. Forgive me, I will do better, and this one-sided
life of ours shall be changed; for while I have been supremely
content you have been miserable."

It was impossible to deny it, and with a tearless sob she
laid her arm about his neck, her head on his shoulder, and
mutely confessed the truth of what he said. The trouble
deepened in his face, but he spoke out more cheerfully, believing
that he had found the secret sorrow.

"Thank heaven, nothing is past mending, and we will
yet be happy. An entire change shall be made; you shall
no longer devote yourself to me, but I to you. Will you
go abroad, and forget this dismal home until its rest grows
inviting, Sylvia?"

"No, Geoffrey, not yet. I will learn to make the home
pleasant, I will work harder, and leave no time for ennui[228]
and discontent. I promised to make your happiness, and
I can do it better here than anywhere. Let me try
again."

"No, Sylvia, you work too hard already; you do everything
with such vehemence you wear out your body before
your will is weary, and that brings melancholy. I am very
credulous, but when I see that acts belie words I cease to
believe. These months assure me that you are not happy;
have I found the secret thorn that frets you?"

She did not answer, for truth she could not, and falsehood
she would not, give him. He rose, went walking to
and fro, searching memory, heart, and conscience for any
other cause, but found none, and saw only one way out of his
bewilderment. He drew a chair before her, sat down, and
looking at her with the masterful expression dominant in
his face, asked briefly       

"Sylvia, have I been tyrannical, unjust, unkind, since
you came to me?"

"Oh, Geoffrey, too generous, too just, too tender!"

"Have I claimed any rights but those you gave me, entreated
or demanded any sacrifices knowingly and wilfully?"

"Never."

"Now I do claim my right to know your heart; I do
entreat and demand one thing, your confidence."

Then she felt that the hour had come, and tried to prepare
to meet it as she should by remembering that she had
endeavored prayerfully, desperately, despairingly, to do her
duty, and had failed. Warwick was right, she could not
forget him. There was such vitality in the man and in the
sentiment he inspired, that it endowed his memory with a
power more potent than the visible presence of her husband.
The knowledge of his love now undid the work that igno[229]rance
had helped patience and pride to achieve before. The
more she struggled to forget, the deeper, dearer, grew the
yearning that must be denied, till months of fruitless effort
convinced her that it was impossible to outlive a passion
more indomitable than will, or penitence, or perseverance.
Now she saw the wisdom of Adam's warning, and felt that
he knew both his friend's heart and her own better than
herself. Now she bitterly regretted that she had not
spoken out when he was there to help her, and before the
least deceit had taken the dignity from sorrow. Nevertheless,
though she trembled she resolved; and while Moor
spoke on, she made ready to atone for past silence by a perfect
loyalty to truth.

"My wife, concealment is not generosity, for the heaviest
trouble shared together could not so take the sweetness from
my life, the charm from home, or make me more miserable
than this want of confidence. It is a double wrong, because
you not only mar my peace but destroy your own by
wasting health and happiness in vain endeavors to bear
some grief alone. Your eye seldom meets mine now, your
words are measured, your actions cautious, your innocent
gayety all gone. You hide your heart from me, you hide
your face; I seem to have lost the frank girl whom I loved,
and found a melancholy woman, who suffers silently till her
honest nature rebels, and brings her to confession in her
sleep. There is no page of my life which I have not freely
shown you; do I do not deserve an equal candor? Shall
I not receive it?"

"Yes."

"Sylvia, what stands between us?"

"Adam Warwick."

Earnest as a prayer, brief as a command had been the[230]
question, instantaneous was the reply, as Sylvia knelt down
before him, put back the veil that should never hide her
from him any more, looked up into her husband's face without
one shadow in her own, and steadily told all.

The revelation was too utterly unexpected, too difficult of
belief to be at once accepted or understood. Moor started
at the name, then leaned forward, breathless and intent, as
if to seize the words before they left her lips; words that
recalled incidents and acts dark and unmeaning till the
spark of intelligence fired a long train of memories and
enlightened him with terrible rapidity. Blinded by his
own devotion, the knowledge of Adam's love and loss
seemed gages of his fidelity; the thought that he loved
Sylvia never had occurred to him, and seemed incredible
even when her own lips told it. She had been right in
fearing the effect this knowledge would have upon him. It
stung his pride, wounded his heart, and forever marred his
faith in love and friendship. As the truth broke over him,
cold and bitter as a billow of the sea, she saw gathering in
his face the still white grief and indignation of an outraged
spirit, suffering with all a woman's pain, with all a man's
intensity of passion. His eye grew fiery and stern, the
veins rose dark upon his forehead, the lines about the
mouth showed hard and grim, the whole face altered terribly.
As she looked, Sylvia thanked heaven that Warwick
was not there to feel the sudden atonement for an innocent
offence which his friend might have exacted before this natural
but unworthy temptation had passed by.

"Now I have given all my confidence though I may have
broken both our hearts in doing it. I do not hope for pardon
yet, but I am sure of pity, and I leave my fate in your
hands. Geoffrey, what shall I do?"[231]

"Wait for me," and putting her away, Moor left the
room.

Suffering too much in mind to remember that she had a
body, Sylvia remained where she was, and leaning her head
upon her hands tried to recall what had passed, to nerve
herself for what was to come. Her first sensation was one
of unutterable relief. The long struggle was over; the
haunting care was gone; there was nothing now to conceal;
she might be herself again, and her spirit rose with something
of its old elasticity as the heavy burden was removed.
A moment she enjoyed this hard-won freedom, then the
memory that the burden was not lost but laid on other
shoulders, filled her with an anguish too sharp to find vent
in tears, too deep to leave any hope of cure except in action.
But how act? She had performed the duty so long, so
vainly delayed, and when the first glow of satisfaction
passed, found redoubled anxiety, regret, and pain before
her. Clear and hard the truth stood there, and no power
of hers could recall the words that showed it to her husband,
could give them back the early blindness, or the later
vicissitudes of hope and fear. In the long silence that filled
the room she had time to calm her perturbation and comfort
her remorse by the vague but helpful belief which seldom
deserts sanguine spirits, that something, as yet unseen and
unsuspected, would appear to heal the breach, to show what
was to be done, and to make all happy in the end.

Where Moor went or how long he stayed Sylvia never
knew, but when at length he came, her first glance showed
her that pride is as much to be dreaded as passion. No
gold is without alloy, and now she saw the shadow of a
nature which had seemed all sunshine. She knew he was
very proud, but never thought to be the cause of its saddest[232]
manifestation; one which showed her that its presence
could make the silent sorrow of a just and gentle man a
harder trial to sustain than the hottest anger, the bitterest
reproach. Scarcely paler than when he went, there was no
sign of violent emotion in his countenance. His eye shone
keen and dark, an anxious fold crossed his forehead, and a
melancholy gravity replaced the cheerful serenity his face
once wore. Wherein the alteration lay Sylvia could not
tell, but over the whole man some subtle change had passed.
The sudden frost which had blighted the tenderest affection
of his life seemed to have left its chill behind, robbing his
manner of its cordial charm, his voice of its heartsome ring,
and giving him the look of one who sternly said       "I must
suffer, but it shall be alone."

Cold and quiet, he stood regarding her with a strange
expression, as if endeavoring to realize the truth, and see
in her not his wife but Warwick's lover. Oppressed by the
old fear, now augmented by a measureless regret, she could
only look up at him feeling that her husband had become
her judge. Yet as she looked she was conscious of a momentary
wonder at the seeming transposition of character
in the two so near and dear to her. Strong-hearted Warwick
wept like any child, but accepted his disappointment
without complaint and bore it manfully. Moor, from
whom she would sooner have expected such demonstration,
grew stormy first, then stern, as she once believed his friend
would have done. She forgot that Moor's pain was the
sharper, his wound the deeper, for the patient hope cherished
so long; the knowledge that he never had been, never could
be loved as he loved; the sense of wrong that could not but
burn even in the meekest heart at such a late discovery,
such an entire loss.[233]

Sylvia spoke first, not audibly, but with a little gesture of
supplication, a glance of sorrowful submission. He answered
both, not by lamentation or reproach, but by just enough of
his accustomed tenderness in touch and tone to make her
tears break forth, as he placed her in the ancient chair so
often occupied together, took the one opposite, and sweeping
a clear space on the table between them, looked across
it with the air of a man bent on seeing his way and following
it at any cost.

"Now Sylvia, I can listen as I should."

"Oh, Geoffrey, what can I say?"

"Repeat all you have already told me. I only gathered
one fact then, now I want the circumstances, for I find this
confession difficult of belief."

Perhaps no sterner expiation could have been required of
her than to sit there, face to face, eye to eye, and tell again
that little history of thwarted love and fruitless endeavor.
Excitement had given her courage for the first confession,
now it was torture to carefully repeat what had poured
freely from her lips before. But she did it, glad to prove
her penitence by any test he might apply. Tears often
blinded her, uncontrollable emotion often arrested her; and
more than once she turned on him a beseeching look, which
asked as plainly as words, "Must I go on?"

Intent on learning all, Moor was unconscious of the trial
he imposed, unaware that the change in himself was the
keenest reproach he could have made, and still with a persistency
as gentle as inflexible, he pursued his purpose to
the end. When great drops rolled down her cheeks he
dried them silently; when she paused, he waited till she
calmed herself; and when she spoke he listened with few
interruptions but a question now and then. Occasionally a[234]
sudden flush of passionate pain swept across his face, as
some phrase, implying rather than expressing Warwick's
love or Sylvia's longing, escaped the narrator's lips, and
when she described their parting on that very spot, his eye
went from her to the hearth her words seemed to make
desolate, with a glance she never could forget. But when
the last question was answered, the last appeal for pardon
brokenly uttered, nothing but the pale pride remained; and
his voice was cold and quiet as his mien.

"Yes, it is this which has baffled and kept me groping in
the dark so long, for I wholly trusted what I wholly loved."

"Alas, it was that very confidence that made my task seem
so necessary and so hard. How often I longed to go to you
with my great trouble as I used to do with lesser ones.
But here you would suffer more than I; and having done
the wrong, it was for me to pay the penalty. So like
many another weak yet willing soul, I tried to keep you
happy at all costs."

"One frank word before I married you would have spared
us this. Could you not foresee the end and dare to speak
it, Sylvia?"

"I see it now, I did not then, else I would have spoken
as freely as I speak to-night. I thought I had outlived my
love for Adam; it seemed kind to spare you a knowledge
that would disturb your friendship, so though I told the
truth, I did not tell it all. I thought temptations came
from without; I could withstand such, and I did, even
when it wore Adam's shape. This temptation came so suddenly,
seemed so harmless, generous and just, that I yielded
to it unconscious that it was one. Surely I deceived myself
as cruelly as I did you, and God knows I have tried to
atone for it when time taught me my fatal error."[235]

"Poor child, it was too soon for you to play the perilous
game of hearts. I should have known it, and left you to
the safe and simple joys of girlhood. Forgive me that I
have kept you a prisoner so long; take off the fetter I put
on, and go, Sylvia."

"No, do not put me from you yet; do not think that I
can hurt you so, and then be glad to leave you suffering
alone. Look like your kind self if you can; talk to me
as you used to; let me show you my heart and you will see
how large a place you fill in it. Let me begin again, for
now the secret is told there is no fear to keep out love; and
I can give my whole strength to learning the lesson you
have tried so patiently to teach."

"You cannot, Sylvia. We are as much divorced as if
judge and jury had decided the righteous but hard separation
for us. You can never be a wife to me with an unconquerable
affection in your heart; I can never be your husband
while the shadow of a fear remains. I will have all or
nothing."

"Adam foretold this. He knew you best, and I should
have followed the brave counsel he gave me long ago. Oh,
if he were only here to help us now!"

The desire broke from Sylvia's lips involuntarily as she
turned for strength to the strong soul that loved her. But
it was like wind to smouldering fire; a pang of jealousy
wrung Moor's heart, and he spoke out with a flash of the
eye that startled Sylvia more than the rapid change of
voice and manner.

"Hush! Say anything of yourself or me, and I can
bear it, but spare me the sound of Adam's name to-night.
A man's nature is not forgiving like a woman's, and the
best of us harbor impulses you know nothing of. If I am[236]
to lose wife, friend, and home, for God's sake leave me my
self-respect."

All the coldness and pride passed from Moor's face as
the climax of his sorrow came; with an impetuous gesture
he threw his arms across the table, and laid down his head
in a paroxysm of tearless suffering such as men only know.

How Sylvia longed to speak! But what consolation
could the tenderest words supply? She searched for some
alleviating suggestion, some happier hope; none came.
Her eye turned imploringly to the pictured Fates above her
as if imploring them to aid her. But they looked back at
her inexorably dumb, and instinctively her thought passed
beyond them to the Ruler of all fates, asking the help which
never is refused. No words embodied her appeal, no sound
expressed it, only a voiceless cry from the depths of a contrite
spirit, owning its weakness, making known its want.
She prayed for submission, but her deeper need was seen,
and when she asked for patience to endure, Heaven sent her
power to act, and out of this sharp trial brought her a better
strength and clearer knowledge of herself than years of
smoother experience could have bestowed. A sense of security,
of stability, came to her as that entire reliance assured
her by its all-sustaining power that she had found what
she most needed to make life clear to her and duty sweet.
With her face in her hands, she sat, forgetful that she was
not alone, as in that brief but precious moment she felt the
exceeding comfort of a childlike faith in the one Friend
who, when we are deserted by all, even by ourselves, puts
forth His hand and gathers us tenderly to Himself.

Her husband's voice recalled her, and looking up she
showed him such an earnest, patient countenance, it touched
him like an unconscious rebuke. The first tears she had[237]
seen rose to his eyes, and all the old tenderness came back
into his voice, softening the dismissal which had been more
coldly begun.

"Dear, silence and rest are best for both of us to-night.
We cannot treat this trouble as we should till we are calmer;
then we will take counsel how soonest to end what never
should have been begun. Forgive me, pray for me, and in
sleep forget me for a little while."

He held the door for her, but as she passed Sylvia lifted
her face for the good night caress without which she had
never left him since she became his wife. She did not
speak, but her eye humbly besought this token of forgiveness;
nor was it denied. Moor laid his hand upon her lips,
saying, "these are Adam's now," and kissed her on the
forehead.

Such a little thing: but it overcame Sylvia with the
sorrowful certainty of the loss which had befallen both, and
she crept away, feeling herself an exile from the heart
and home whose happy mistress she could never be again.

Moor watched the little figure going upward, and weeping
softly as it went, as if he echoed the sad "never any
more," which those tears expressed, and when it vanished
with a backward look, shut himself in alone with his great
sorrow.




CHAPTER XVIII.

WHAT NEXT?


Sylvia laid her head down on her pillow, believing that[238]
this night would be the longest, saddest she had ever known.
But before she had time to sigh for sleep it wrapt her in its
comfortable arms, and held her till day broke. Sunshine
streamed across the room, and early birds piped on the budding
boughs that swayed before the window. But no morning
smile saluted her, no morning flower awaited her, and
nothing but a little note lay on the unpressed pillow at her
side.

"Sylvia, I have gone away to Faith, because this proud,
resentful spirit of mine must be subdued before I meet you.
I leave that behind me which will speak to you more kindly,
calmly than I can now, and show you that my effort has
been equal to my failure. There is nothing for me to do
but submit; manfully if I must, meekly if I can; and this
short exile will prepare me for the longer one to come.
Take counsel with those nearer and dearer to you than myself,
and secure the happiness which I have so ignorantly
delayed, but cannot wilfully destroy. God be with you,
and through all that is and is to come, remember that you
remain beloved forever in the heart of Geoffrey Moor."

Sylvia had known many sad uprisings, but never a sadder
one than this, and the hours that followed aged her more than[239]
any year had done. All day she wandered aimlessly to and
fro, for the inward conflict would not let her rest. The
house seemed home no longer when its presiding genius was
gone, and everywhere some token of his former presence
touched her with its mute reproach.

She asked no counsel of her family, for well she knew the
outburst of condemnation, incredulity, and grief that would
assail her there. They could not help her yet; they would
only augment perplexities, weaken convictions, and distract
her mind. When she was sure of herself she would tell
them, endure their indignation and regret, and steadily execute
the new purpose, whatever it should be.

To many it might seem an easy task to break the bond
that burdened and assume the tie that blessed. But Sylvia
had grown wise in self-knowledge, timorous through self-delusion;
therefore the greater the freedom given her the
more she hesitated to avail herself of it. The nobler each
friend grew as she turned from one to the other, the more
impossible seemed the decision, for generous spirit and loving
heart contended for the mastery, yet neither won. She
knew that Moor had put her from him never to be recalled
till some miracle was wrought that should make her truly
his. This renunciation showed her how much he had become
to her, how entirely she had learned to lean upon him,
and how great a boon such perfect love was in itself. Even
the prospect of a life with Warwick brought forebodings
with its hope. Reason made her listen to many doubts
which hitherto passion had suppressed. Would she never
tire of his unrest? Could she fill so large a heart and give
it power as well as warmth? Might not the two wills
clash, the ardent natures inflame one another, the stronger
intellect exhaust the weaker, and disappointment come[240]
again? And as she asked these questions, conscience, the
monitor whom no bribe can tempt, no threat silence, invariably
answered "Yes."

But chief among the cares that beset her was one that
grew more burdensome with thought. By her own will she
had put her liberty into another's keeping; law confirmed
the act, gospel sanctioned the vow, and it could only be
redeemed by paying the costly price demanded of those who
own that they have drawn a blank in the lottery of marriage.
Public opinion is a grim ghost that daunts the
bravest, and Sylvia knew that trials lay before her from
which she would shrink and suffer, as only a woman sensitive
and proud as she could shrink and suffer. Once apply
this remedy and any tongue would have the power to wound,
any eye to insult with pity or contempt, any stranger to
criticise or condemn, and she would have no means of redress,
no place of refuge, even in that stronghold, Adam's
heart.

All that dreary day she wrestled with these stubborn
facts, but could neither mould nor modify them as she
would, and evening found her spent, but not decided. Too
excited for sleep, yet too weary for exertion, she turned
bedward, hoping that the darkness and the silence of night
would bring good counsel, if not rest.

Till now she had shunned the library as one shuns the
spot where one has suffered most. But as she passed the
open door the gloom that reigned within seemed typical of
that which had fallen on its absent master, and following
the impulse of the moment Sylvia went in to light it with
the little glimmer of her lamp. Nothing had been touched,
for no hand but her own preserved the order of this room,
and all household duties had been neglected on that day.[241]
The old chair stood where she had left it, and over its arm
was thrown the velvet coat, half dressing-gown, half blouse,
that Moor liked to wear at this household trysting-place.
Sylvia bent to fold it smoothly as it hung, and feeling that
she must solace herself with some touch of tenderness, laid
her cheek against the soft garment, whispering "Good
night." Something glittered on the cushion of the chair,
and looking nearer she found a steel-clasped book, upon
the cover of which lay a dead heliotrope, a little key.

It was Moor's Diary, and now she understood that passage
of the note which had been obscure before. "I leave
that behind me which will speak to you more kindly, calmly,
than I can now, and show you that my effort has been
equal to my failure." She had often begged to read it,
threatened to pick the lock, and felt the strongest curiosity
to learn what was contained in the long entries that he
daily made. Her requests had always been answered with
the promise of entire possession of the book when the year
was out. Now he gave it, though the year was not gone,
and many leaves were yet unfilled. He thought she would
come to this room first, would see her morning flower laid
ready for her, and, sitting in what they called their Refuge,
would draw some comfort for herself, some palliation for his
innocent offence, from the record so abruptly ended.

She took it, went away to her own room, unlocked the
short romance of his wedded life, and found her husband's
heart laid bare before her.

It was a strange and solemn thing to look so deeply into
the private experience of a fellow-being; to trace the birth
and progress of purposes and passions, the motives of action,
the secret aspirations, the besetting sins that made up the
inner life he had been leading beside her. Moor wrote[242]
with an eloquent sincerity, because he had put himself into
his book, as if feeling the need of some confidante he had
chosen the only one that pardons egotism. Here, too,
Sylvia saw her chameleon self, etched with loving care, endowed
with all gifts and graces, studied with unflagging
zeal, and made the idol of a life.

Often a tuneful spirit seemed to assert itself, and passing
from smooth prose to smoother poetry, sonnet, song, or
psalm, flowed down the page in cadences stately, sweet, or
solemn, filling the reader with delight at the discovery of a
gift so genuine, yet so shyly folded up within itself, unconscious
that its modesty was the surest token of its worth.
More than once Sylvia laid her face into the book, and
added her involuntary comment on some poem or passage
made pathetic by the present; and more than once paused
to wonder, with exceeding wonder, why she could not give
such genius and affection its reward. Had she needed any
confirmation of the fact so hard to teach herself, this opening
of his innermost would have given it. For while she
bitterly grieved over the death-blow she had dealt his happy
hope, it no longer seemed a possibility to change her stubborn
heart, or lessen by a fraction the debt which she sadly
felt could only be repaid in friendship's silver, not love's
gold.

All night she lay there like some pictured Magdalene,
purer but as penitent as Correggio's Mary, with the book,
the lamp, the melancholy eyes, the golden hair that painters
love. All night she read, gathering courage, not consolation,
from those pages, for seeing what she was not showed
her what she might become; and when she turned the little
key upon that story without an end, Sylvia the girl was
dead, but Sylvia the woman had begun to live.[243]

Lying in the rosy hush of dawn, there came to her a
sudden memory       

"If ever you need help that Geoffrey cannot give, remember
cousin Faith."

This was the hour Faith foresaw; Moor had gone to her
with his trouble, why not follow, and let this woman, wise,
discreet, and gentle, show her what should come next?

The newly risen sun saw Sylvia away upon her journey to
Faith's home among the hills. She lived alone, a cheerful,
busy, solitary soul, demanding little of others, yet giving
freely to whomsoever asked an alms of her.

Sylvia found the gray cottage nestled in a hollow of the
mountain side; a pleasant hermitage, secure and still. Mistress
and maid composed the household, but none of the
gloom of isolation darkened the sunshine that pervaded it;
peace seemed to sit upon its threshold, content to brood
beneath its eaves, and the atmosphere of home to make it
beautiful.

When some momentous purpose or event absorbs us we
break through fears and formalities, act out ourselves forgetful
of reserve, and use the plainest phrases to express
emotions which need no ornament and little aid from language.
Sylvia illustrated this fact, then; for, without hesitation
or embarrassment, she entered Miss Dane's door,
called no servant to announce her, but went, as if by instinct,
straight to the room where Faith sat alone, and with
the simplest greeting asked       

"Is Geoffrey here?"

"He was an hour ago, and will be an hour hence. I
sent him out to rest, for he cannot sleep. I am glad you
came to him; he has not learned to do without you yet."

With no bustle of surprise or sympathy Faith put away[244]
her work, took off the hat and cloak, drew her guest beside
her on the couch before the one deep window looking down
the valley, and gently chafing the chilly hands in warm
ones, said nothing more till Sylvia spoke.

"He has told you all the wrong I have done him?"

"Yes, and found a little comfort here. Do you need consolation
also?"

"Can you ask? But I need something more, and no
one can give it to me so well as you. I want to be set
right, to hear things called by their true names, to be taken
out of myself and made to see why I am always doing
wrong while trying to do well."

"Your father, sister, or brother are fitter for that task
than I. Have you tried them?"

"No, and I will not. They love me, but they could not
help me; for they would beg me to conceal if I cannot forget,
to endure if I cannot conquer, and abide by my mistake
at all costs. That is not the help I want. I desire to
know the one just thing to be done, and to be made brave
enough to do it, though friends lament, gossips clamor, and
the heavens fall. I am in earnest now. Rate me sharply,
drag out my weaknesses, shame my follies, show no mercy
to my selfish hopes; and when I can no longer hide from
myself put me in the way I should go, and I will follow it
though my feet bleed at every step."

She was in earnest now, terribly so, but still Faith drew
back, though her compassionate face belied her hesitating
words.

"Go to Adam; who wiser or more just than he?"

"I cannot. He, as well as Geoffrey, loves me too well
to decide for me. You stand between them, wise as the
one, gentle as the other, and you do not care for me enough[245]
to let affection hoodwink reason. Faith, you bade me come;
do not cast me off, for if you shut your heart against me I
know not where to go."

Despairing she spoke, disconsolate she looked, and Faith's
reluctance vanished. The maternal aspect returned, her
voice resumed its warmth, her eye its benignity, and Sylvia
was reassured before a word was spoken.

"I do not cast you off, nor shut my heart against you.
I only hesitated to assume such responsibility, and shrunk
from the task because of compassion, not coldness. Sit
here, and tell me all your trouble, Sylvia?"

"That is so kind! It seems quite natural to turn to you
as if I had a claim upon you. Let me have, and if you
can, love me a little, because I have no mother, and need
one very much."

"My child, you shall not need one any more."

"I feel that, and am comforted already. Faith, if you
were me, and stood where I stand, beloved by two men,
either of whom any woman might be proud to call husband,
putting self away, to which should you cleave?"

"To neither."

Sylvia paled and trembled, as if the oracle she had invoked
was an unanswerable voice pronouncing the inevitable.
She watched Faith's countenance a moment, groping
for her meaning, failed to find it, and whispered below
her breath       

"Can I know why?"

"Because your husband is, your lover should be your friend
and nothing more. You have been hardly taught the lesson
many have to learn, that friendship cannot fill love's place,
yet should be kept inviolate, and served as an austerer mistress
who can make life very beautiful to such as feel her[246]
worth and deserve her delights. Adam taught me this,
for though Geoffrey took you from him, he still held fast
his friend, letting no disappointment sour, no envy alienate,
no resentment destroy the perfect friendship years of mutual
fidelity have built up between them."

"Yes!" cried Sylvia, "how I have honored Adam for
that steadfastness, and how I have despised myself, because
I could not be as wise and faithful in the earlier, safer sentiment
I felt for Geoffrey."

"Be wise and faithful now; cease to be the wife, but remain
the friend; freely give all you can with honesty, not
one jot more."

"Never did man possess a truer friend than I will be to
him       if he will let me. But, Faith, if I may be that to
Geoffrey, may I not be something nearer and dearer to
Adam? Would not you dare to hope it, were you me?"

"No, Sylvia, never."

"Why not?"

"If you were blind, a cripple, or cursed with some incurable
infirmity of body, would not you hesitate to bind
yourself and your affliction to another?"

"You know I should not only hesitate, but utterly refuse."

"I do know it, therefore I venture to show you why, according
to my belief, you should not marry Adam. I cannot
tell you as I ought, but only try to show you where to
seek the explanation of my seeming harsh advice. There
are diseases more subtle and dangerous than any that vex
our flesh; diseases that should be as carefully cured if curable,
as inexorably prevented from spreading as any malady
we dread. A paralyzed will, a morbid mind, a mad temper,
a tainted heart, a blind soul, are afflictions to be as[247]
much regarded as bodily infirmities. Nay, more, inasmuch
as souls are of greater value than perishable flesh.
Where this is religiously taught, believed, and practised,
marriage becomes in truth a sacrament blessed of God;
children thank parents for the gift of life; parents see in
children living satisfactions and rewards, not reproaches or
retributions doubly heavy to be borne, for the knowledge
that where two sinned, many must inevitably suffer."

"You try to tell me gently, Faith, but I see that you
consider me one of the innocent unfortunates, who have no
right to marry till they be healed, perhaps never. I have
dimly felt this during the past year, now I know it, and
thank God that I have no child to reproach me hereafter,
for bequeathing it the mental ills I have not yet outlived."

"Dear Sylvia, you are an exceptional case in all respects,
because an extreme one. The ancient theology of two contending
spirits in one body, is strangely exemplified in you,
for each rules by turns, and each helps or hinders as moods
and circumstances lead. Even in the great event of a woman's
life, you were thwarted by conflicting powers; impulse
and ignorance, passion and pride, hope and despair.
Now you stand at the parting of the ways, looking wistfully
along the pleasant one where Adam seems to beckon, while
I point down the rugged one where I have walked, and
though my heart aches as I do it, counsel you as I would a
daughter of my own."

"I thank you, I will follow you, but my life looks very
barren if I must relinquish my desire."

"Not as barren as if you possessed your desire, and
found in it another misery and mistake. Could you have
loved Geoffrey, it might have been safe and well with you;
loving Adam, it is neither. Let me show you why. He is[248]
an exception like yourself; perhaps that explains your attraction
for each other. In him the head rules, in Geoffrey
the heart. The one criticises, the other loves mankind.
Geoffrey is proud and private in all that lies nearest him,
clings to persons, and is faithful as a woman. Adam has
only the pride of an intellect which tests all things, and
abides by its own insight. He clings to principles; persons
are but animated facts or ideas; he seizes, searches, uses
them, and when they have no more for him, drops them like
the husk, whose kernel he has secured; passing on to find
and study other samples without regret, but with unabated
zeal. For life to him is perpetual progress, and he obeys
the law of his nature as steadily as sun or sea. Is not this
so?"

"All true; what more, Faith?"

"Few women, if wise, would dare to marry this man,
noble and love-worthy as he is, till time has tamed and
experience developed him. Even then the risk is great, for
he demands and unconsciously absorbs into himself the
personality of others, making large returns, but of a kind
which only those as strong, sagacious, and steadfast as
himself can receive and adapt to their individual uses,
without being overcome and possessed. That none of us
should be, except by the Spirit stronger than man, purer
than woman. You feel, though you do not understand this
power. You know that his presence excites, yet wearies
you; that, while you love, you fear him, and even when
you long to be all in all to him, you doubt your ability to
make his happiness. Am I not right?"

"I must say, yes."

"Then, it is scarcely necessary for me to tell you that I
think this unequal marriage would be but a brief one for[249]
you; bright at its beginning, dark at its end. With him
you would exhaust yourself in passionate endeavors to follow
where he led. He would not know this, you would not
confess it, but too late you might both learn that you were
too young, too ardent, too frail in all but the might of love,
to be his wife. It is like a woodbird mating with an eagle,
straining its little wings to scale the sky with him, blinding
itself with gazing at the sun, striving to fill and warm
the wild eyrie which becomes its home, and perishing in
the stern solitude the other loves. Yet, too fond and faithful
to regret the safer nest among the grass, the gentler
mate it might have had, the summer life and winter flitting
to the south for which it was designed."

"Faith, you frighten me; you seem to see and show me all
the dim forebodings I have hidden away within myself,
because I could not understand or dared not face them.
How have you learned so much? How can you read me so
well? and who told you these things of us all?"

"I had an unhappy girlhood in a discordant home; early
cares and losses made me old in youth, and taught me to
observe how others bore their burdens. Since then solitude
has led me to study and reflect upon the question toward
which my thoughts inevitably turned. Concerning yourself
and your past Geoffrey told me much but Adam more."

"Have you seen him? Has he been here? When,
Faith, when?"

Light and color flashed back into Sylvia's face, and the
glad eagerness of her voice was a pleasant sound to hear
after the despairing accents gone before. Faith sighed, but
answered fully, carefully, while the compassion of her look
deepened as she spoke.

"I saw him but a week ago, vehement and vigorous as[250]
ever. He has come hither often during the winter, has
watched you unseen, and brought me news of you which
made Geoffrey's disclosure scarcely a surprise. He said
you bade him hear of you through me, that he preferred to
come, not write, for letters were often false interpreters,
but face to face one gets the real thought of one's friend by
look, as well as word, and the result is satisfactory."

"That is Adam! But what more did he say? How did
you advise him? I know he asked counsel of you, as we
all have done."

"He did, and I gave it as frankly as to you and Geoffrey.
He made me understand you, judge you leniently,
see in you the virtues you have cherished despite drawbacks
such as few have to struggle with. Your father made
Adam his confessor during the happy month when you first
knew him. I need not tell you how he received and preserved
such a trust. He betrayed no confidence, but in
speaking of you I saw that his knowledge of the father
taught him to understand the daughter. It was well and
beautifully done, and did we need anything to endear him
to us this trait of character would do it, for it is a rare endowment,
the power of overcoming all obstacles of pride,
age, and the sad reserve self-condemnation brings us, and
making confession a grateful healing."

"I know it; we tell our sorrows to such as Geoffrey, our
sins to such as Adam. But, Faith, when you spoke of me,
did you say to him what you have been saying to me about
my unfitness to be his wife because of inequality, and my
unhappy inheritance?"

"Could I do otherwise when he fixed that commanding
eye of his upon me asking, 'Is my love as wise as it is
[251]warm?' He is one of those who force the hardest truths
from us by the simple fact that they can bear it, and would
do the same for us. He needed it then, for though instinct
was right,       hence his anxious question,       his heart, never
so entirely roused as now, made it difficult for him to judge
of your relations to one another, and there my woman's insight
helped him."

"What did he do when you told him? I see that you
will yet hesitate to tell me. I think you have been preparing
me to hear it. Speak out. Though my cheeks
whiten and my hands tremble I can bear it, for you shall
be the law by which I will abide."

"You shall be a law to yourself, my brave Sylvia. Put
your hands in mine and hold fast to the friend who loves
and honors you for this. I will tell you what Adam did
and said. He sat in deep thought many minutes; but with
him to see is to do, and soon he turned to me with the
courageous expression which in him signifies that the fight
is fought, the victory won. 'It is necessary to be just, it
is not necessary to be happy. I shall never marry Sylvia,
even if I may,'       and with that paraphrase of words,
whose meaning seemed to fit his need, he went away. I
think he will not come again either to me       or you."

How still the room grew as Faith's reluctant lips uttered
the last words! Sylvia sat motionless looking out into the
sunny valley, with eyes that saw nothing but the image of
that beloved friend leaving her perhaps forever. Well she
knew that with this man to see was to do, and with a woeful
sense of desolation falling cold upon her heart, she felt
that there was nothing more to hope for but a brave submission
like his own. Yet in that pause there came a feeling
of relief after the first despair. The power of choice was no
longer left her, and the help she needed was bestowed by[252]
one who could decide against himself, inspired by a sentiment
which curbed a strong man's love of power, and made
it subject to a just man's love of right. Great examples
never lose their virtue; what Pompey was to Warwick that
Warwick became to Sylvia, and in the moment of supremest
sorrow she felt the fire of a noble emulation kindling within
her from the spark he left behind.

"Faith, what comes next?"

"This," and she was gathered close while Faith confessed
how hard her task had been by letting tears fall fast upon
the head which seemed to have found its proper resting-place,
as if despite her courage and her wisdom the woman's
heart was half broken with its pity. Better than any words
was the motherly embrace, the silent shower, the blessed
balm of sympathy which soothed the wounds it could not
heal. Leaning against each other the two hearts talked
together in the silence, feeling the beauty of the tie kind
Nature weaves between the hearts that should be knit.
Faith often turned her lips to Sylvia's forehead, brushed
back her hair with a lingering touch, and drew her nearer
as if it was very pleasant to see and feel the little creature
in her arms. Sylvia lay there, tearless and tranquil;
thinking thoughts for which she had no words, and trying
to prepare herself for the life to come, a life that now looked
very desolate. Her eye still rested on the valley where the
river flowed, the elms waved their budding boughs in the
bland air, and the meadows wore their earliest tinge of
green. But she was not conscious of these things till
the sight of a solitary figure coming slowly up the hill
recalled her to the present and the duties it still held
for her.

[253]"Here is Geoffrey! How wearily he walks,       how
changed and old he looks,       oh, why was I born to be a
curse to all who love me!"

"Hush, Sylvia, say anything but that, because it casts
reproach upon your father. Your life is but just begun;
make it a blessing, not a curse, as all of us have power to
do; and remember that for every affliction there are two
helpers, who can heal or end the heaviest we know       Time
and Death. The first we may invoke and wait for; the
last God alone can send when it is better not to live."

"I will try to be patient. Will you meet and tell
Geoffrey what has passed? I have no strength left but for
passive endurance."

Faith went; Sylvia heard the murmur of earnest conversation;
then steps came rapidly along the hall, and
Moor was in the room. She rose involuntarily, but for a
moment neither spoke, for never had they met as now.
Each regarded the other as if a year had rolled between
them since they parted, and each saw in the other the
changes that one day had wrought. Neither the fire of resentment
nor the frost of pride now rendered Moor's face
stormy or stern. Anxious and worn it was, with newly
graven lines upon the forehead and melancholy curves about
the mouth, but the peace of a conquered spirit touched it
with a pale serenity, and some perennial hope shone in the
glance he bent upon his wife. For the first time in her life
Sylvia was truly beautiful,       not physically, for never had
she looked more weak and wan, but spiritually, as the inward
change made itself manifest in an indescribable
expression of meekness and of strength. With suffering
came submission, with repentance came regeneration, and
the power of the woman yet to be, touched with beauty the
pathos of the woman now passing through the fire.[254]

"Faith has told you what has passed between us, and
you know that my loss is a double one," she said. "Let
me add that I deserve it, that I clearly see my mistakes,
will amend such as I can, bear the consequences of such as
are past help, try to profit by all, and make no new ones.
I cannot be your wife, I ought not to be Adam's; but I
may be myself, may live my life alone, and being friends
with both wrong neither. This is my decision; in it I believe,
by it I will abide, and if it be a just one God will
not let me fail."

"I submit, Sylvia; I can still hope and wait."

So humbly he said it, so heartily he meant it, she felt
that his love was as indomitable as Warwick's will, and the
wish that it were right and possible to accept and reward it
woke with all its old intensity. It was not possible; and
though her heart grew heavier within her, Sylvia answered
steadily       

"No, Geoffrey, do not hope, do not wait; forgive me and
forget me. Go abroad as you proposed; travel far and stay
long away. Change your life, and learn to see in me only
the friend I once was and still desire to be."

"I will go, will stay till you recall me, but while you
live your life alone I shall still hope and wait."

This invincible fidelity, so patient, so persistent, impressed
the listener like a prophecy, disturbed her conviction,
arrested the words upon her lips and softened them.

"It is not for one so unstable as myself to say, 'I shall never
change.' I do not say it, though I heartily believe it, but
will leave all to time. Surely I may do this; may let
separation gently, gradually convince you or alter me; and
as the one return which I can make for all you have given
me, let this tie between us remain unbroken for a little[255]
longer. Take this poor consolation with you; it is the best
that I can offer now. Mine is the knowledge that however
I may thwart your life in this world, there is a beautiful
eternity in which you will forget me and be happy."

She gave him comfort, but he robbed her of her own as
he drew her to him, answering with a glance brighter than
any smile       

"Love is immortal, dear, and even in the 'beautiful
eternity' I shall still hope and wait."



How soon it was all over! the return to separate homes,
the disclosures, and the storms; the preparations for the
solitary voyage, the last charges and farewells.

Mark would not, and Prue could not, go to see the traveller
off; the former being too angry to lend his countenance
to what he termed a barbarous banishment, the latter,
being half blind with crying, stayed to nurse Jessie, whose
soft heart was nearly broken at what seemed to her the most
direful affliction under heaven.

But Sylvia and her father followed Moor till his foot
left the soil, and still lingered on the wharf to watch the
steamer out of port. An uncongenial place in which to
part; carriages rolled up and down, a clamor of voices filled
the air, the little steamtug snorted with impatience, and
the waves flowed seaward with the ebbing of the tide.
But father and daughter saw only one object, heard only
one sound, Moor's face as it looked down upon them from
the deck, Moor's voice as he sent cheery messages to those
left behind. Mr. Yule was endeavoring to reply as cheerily,
and Sylvia was gazing with eyes that saw very dimly
through their tears, when both were aware of an instantaneous
change in the countenance they watched. Something[256]
beyond themselves seemed to arrest Moor's eye; a moment
he stood intent and motionless, then flushed to the forehead
with the dark glow Sylvia remembered well, waved
his hand to them and vanished down the cabin stairs.

"Papa, what did he see?"

There was no need of any answer; Adam Warwick came
striding through the crowd, saw them, paused with both
hands out, and a questioning glance as if uncertain of his
greeting. With one impulse the hands were taken; Sylvia
could not speak, her father could, and did approvingly       

"Welcome, Warwick; you are come to say good by to
Geoffrey?"

"Rather to you, sir; he needs none, I go with him."

"With him!" echoed both hearers.

"Ay, that I will. Did you think I would let him go
away alone feeling bereaved of wife, and home, and
friend?"

"We should have known you better. But, Warwick,
he will shun you; he hid himself just now as you approached;
he has tried to forgive, but he cannot so soon
forget."

"All the more need of my helping him to do both. He
cannot shun me long with no hiding-place to fly to but the
sea, and I will so gently constrain him by the old-time love
we bore each other, that he must relent and take me back
into his heart again."

"Oh, Adam! go with him, stay with him, and bring
him safely back to me when time has helped us all."

"I shall do it, God willing."

Unmindful of all else Warwick bent and took her to him
as he gave the promise, seemed to put his whole heart into
a single kiss and left her trembling with the stress of his[257]
farewell. She saw him cleave his way through the throng,
leap the space left by the gangway just withdrawn, and
vanish in search of that lost friend. Then she turned her
face to her father's shoulder, conscious of nothing but the
fact that Warwick had come and gone.

A cannon boomed, the crowd cheered, the last cable was
flung off, and the steamer glided from her moorings with
the surge of water and the waft of wind like some sea-monster
eager to be out upon the ocean free again.

"Look up, Sylvia; she will soon pass from sight."

"Are they there?"

"No."

"Then I do not care to see. Look for me, father, and
tell me when they come."

"They will not come, dear; both have said good by,
and we have seen the last of them for many a long day."

"They will come! Adam will bring Geoffrey to show
me they are friends again. I know it; you shall see it.
Lift me to that block and watch the deck with me that we
may see them the instant they appear."

Up she sprung, eyes clear now, nerves steady, faith
strong. Leaning forward so utterly forgetful of herself,
she would have fallen into the green water tumbling there
below, had not her father held her fast. How slowly the
minutes seemed to pass, how rapidly the steamer seemed to
glide away, how heavily the sense of loss weighed on her
heart as wave after wave rolled between her and her heart's
desire.

"Come down, Sylvia, it is giving yourself useless pain
to watch and wait. Come home, my child, and let us comfort
one another."

She did not hear him, for as he spoke the steamer swung[258]
slowly round to launch itself into the open bay, and with a
cry that drew many eyes upon the young figure with its
face of pale expectancy, Sylvia saw her hope fulfilled.

"I knew they would come! See, father, see! Geoffrey
is smiling as he waves his handkerchief, and Adam's hand
is on his shoulder. Answer them! oh, answer them! I
can only look."

The old man did answer them enthusiastically, and Sylvia
stretched her arms across the widening space as if to
bring them back again. Side by side the friends stood
now; Moor's eye upon his wife, while from his hand the
little flag of peace streamed in the wind. But Warwick's
glance was turned upon his friend, and Warwick's hand
already seemed to claim the charge he had accepted.

Standing thus they passed from sight, never to come
sailing home together as the woman on the shore was praying
God to let her see them come.




CHAPTER XIX.

SIX MONTHS.


The ensuing half year seemed fuller of duties and events[259]
than any Sylvia had ever known. At first she found it
very hard to live her life alone; for inward solitude oppressed
her, and external trials were not wanting. Only to the
few who had a right to know, had the whole trouble been
confided. They were discreet from family pride, if from no
tenderer feeling; but the curious world outside of that small
circle was full of shrewd surmises, of keen eyes for discovering
domestic breaches, and shrill tongues for proclaiming
them. Warwick escaped suspicion, being so little known,
so seldom seen; but for the usual nine days matrons and
venerable maids wagged their caps, lifted their hands, and
sighed as they sipped their dish of scandal and of tea       

"Poor young man! I always said how it would be, she
was so peculiar. My dear creature, haven't you heard that
Mrs. Moor isn't happy with her husband, and that he has
gone abroad quite broken-hearted?"

Sylvia felt this deeply, but received it as her just punishment,
and bore herself so meekly that public opinion soon
turned a somersault, and the murmur changed to       

"Poor young thing! what could she expect? My dear,
I have it from the best authority, that Mr. Moor has made
her miserable for a year, and now left her broken-hearted."[260]
After that, the gossips took up some newer tragedy, and left
Mrs. Moor to mend her heart as best she could, a favor very
gratefully received.

As Hester Prynne seemed to see some trace of her own
sin in every bosom, by the glare of the Scarlet Letter
burning on her own; so Sylvia, living in the shadow of a
household grief, found herself detecting various phases of
her own experience in others. She had joined that sad
sisterhood called disappointed women; a larger class than
many deem it to be, though there are few of us who have
not seen members of it. Unhappy wives; mistaken or forsaken
lovers; meek souls, who make life a long penance for
the sins of others; gifted creatures kindled into fitful brilliancy
by some inward fire that consumes but cannot warm.
These are the women who fly to convents, write bitter books,
sing songs full of heartbreak, act splendidly the passion they
have lost or never won. Who smile, and try to lead brave
uncomplaining lives, but whose tragic eyes betray them,
whose voices, however sweet or gay, contain an undertone
of hopelessness, whose faces sometimes startle one with
an expression which haunts the observer long after it is
gone.

Undoubtedly Sylvia would have joined the melancholy
chorus, and fallen to lamenting that ever she was born, had
she not possessed a purpose that took her out of herself and
proved her salvation. Faith's words took root and blossomed.
Intent on making her life a blessing, not a reproach
to her father, she lived for him entirely. He had
taken her back to him, as if the burden of her unhappy
past should be upon his shoulders, the expiation of her
faults come from him alone. Sylvia understood this now,
and nestled to him so gladly, so confidingly, he seemed to[261]
have found again the daughter he had lost and be almost
content to have her all his own.

How many roofs cover families or friends who live years
together, yet never truly know each other; who love, and
long and try to meet, yet fail to do so till some unexpected
emotion or event performs the work. In the weeks that
followed the departure of the friends, Sylvia discovered this
and learned to know her father. No one was so much to her
as he; no one so fully entered into her thoughts and feelings;
for sympathy drew them tenderly together, and sorrow
made them equals. As man and woman they talked, as
father and daughter they loved; and the beautiful relation
became their truest solace and support.

Miss Yule both rejoiced at and rebelled against this;
was generous, yet mortally jealous; made no complaint, but
grieved in private, and one fine day amazed her sister by
announcing, that, being of no farther use at home, she had
decided to be married. Both Mr. Yule and Sylvia had
desired this event, but hardly dared to expect it in spite
of sundry propitious signs and circumstances.

A certain worthy widower had haunted the house of late,
evidently on matrimonial thoughts intent. A solid gentleman,
both physically and financially speaking; possessed of
an ill-kept house, bad servants, and nine neglected children.
This prospect, however alarming to others, had great
charms for Prue; nor was the Reverend Gamaliel Bliss repugnant
to her, being a rubicund, bland personage, much
given to fine linen, long dinners, and short sermons. His
third spouse had been suddenly translated, and though the
years of mourning had not yet expired, things went so hardly
with Gamaliel, that he could no longer delay casting his
pastoral eyes over the flock which had already given three[262]
lambs to his fold, in search of a fourth. None appeared
whose meek graces were sufficiently attractive, or whose
dowries were sufficiently large. Meantime the nine olive-branches
grew wild, the servants revelled, the ministerial
digestion suffered, the sacred shirts went buttonless, and
their wearer was wellnigh distraught. At this crisis he
saw Prudence, and fell into a way of seating himself before
the well-endowed spinster, with a large cambric pocket-handkerchief
upon his knee, a frequent tear meandering
down his florid countenance, and volcanic sighs agitating
his capacious waistcoat as he poured his woes into her ear.
Prue had been deeply touched by these moist appeals, and
was not much surprised when the reverend gentleman went
ponderously down upon his knee before her in the good
old-fashioned style which frequent use had endeared to him,
murmuring with an appropriate quotation and a subterranean
sob       

"Miss Yule, 'a good wife is a crown to her husband;'
be such an one to me, unworthy as I am, and a mother to
my bereaved babes, who suffer for a tender woman's care."

She merely upset her sewing-table with an appropriate
start, but speedily recovered, and with a maidenly blush
murmured in return       

"Dear me, how very unexpected! pray speak to papa,       oh,
rise, I beg."

"Call me Gamaliel, and I obey!" gasped the stout lover,
divided between rapture and doubts of his ability to perform
the feat alone.

"Gamaliel," sighed Prue, surrendering her hand.

"My Prudence, blessed among women!" responded the
blissful Bliss. And having saluted the fair member, allowed
it to help him rise; when, after a few decorous endearments,[263]
he departed to papa, and the bride elect rushed up to
Sylvia with the incoherent announcement       

"My dearest child, I have accepted him! It was such
a surprise, though so touchingly done. I was positively
mortified; Maria had swept the room so ill, his knees were
white with lint, and I'm a very happy woman, bless you,
love!"

"Sit down, and tell me all about it," cried her sister.
"Don't try to sew, but cry if you like, and let me pet you,
for indeed I am rejoiced."

But Prue preferred to rock violently, and boggle down a
seam as the best quietus for her fluttered nerves, while she
told her romance, received congratulations, and settled a
few objections made by Sylvia, who tried to play the prudent
matron.

"I am afraid he is too old for you, my dear."

"Just the age; a man should always be ten years older
than his wife. A woman of thirty-five is in the prime of
life, and if she hasn't arrived at years of discretion then,
she never will. Shall I wear pearl-colored silk and a white
bonnet, or just a very handsome travelling dress?"

"Whichever you like. But, Prue, isn't he rather stout,
I won't say corpulent?"

"Sylvia, how can you! Because papa is a shadow, you
call a fine, manly person like Gam       Mr. Bliss, corpulent.
I always said I would not marry an invalid, (Macgregor
died of apoplexy last week, I heard, at a small dinner
party; fell forward with his head upon the cheese, and
expired without a groan,) and where can you find a more
robust and healthy man than Mr. Bliss? Not a gray hair,
and gout his only complaint. So aristocratic. You know
I've loads of fine old flannel, just the thing for him."[264]

Sylvia commanded her countenance with difficulty, and
went on with her maternal inquiries.

"He is a personable man, and an excellent one, I believe,
yet I should rather dread the responsibility of nine small
children, if I were you."

"They are my chief inducement to the match. Just
think of the state those dears must be in, with only a young
governess, and half a dozen giddy maids to see to them. I
long to be among them, and named an early day, because
measles and scarlatina are coming round again, and only
Fanny, and the twins, Gus and Gam, have had either. I
know all their names and ages, dispositions, and characters,
and love them like a mother already. He perfectly
adores them, and that is very charming in a learned man
like Mr. Bliss."

"If that is your feeling it will all go well I have
no doubt. But, Prue,       I don't wish to be unkind, dear,       do
you quite like the idea of being the fourth Mrs.
Bliss?"

"Bless me, I never thought of that! Poor man, it only
shows how much he must need consolation, and proves how
good a husband he must have been. No, Sylvia, I don't
care a particle. I never knew those estimable ladies, and
the memory of them shall not keep me from making Gamaliel
happy if I can. What he goes through now is almost
beyond belief. My child, just think!       the coachman
drinks; the cook has tea-parties whenever she likes, and
supports her brother's family out of her perquisites, as she
calls her bare-faced thefts; the house maids romp with the
indoor man, and have endless followers; three old maids
set their caps at him, and that hussy, (I must use a strong
expression,) that hussy of a governess makes love to him[265]
before the children. It is my duty to marry him; I shall
do it, and put an end to this fearful state of things."

Sylvia asked but one more question       

"Now, seriously, do you love him very much? Will he
make you as happy as my dear old girl should be?"

Prue dropped her work, and hiding her face on Sylvia's
shoulder, answered with a plaintive sniff or two, and much
real feeling       

"Yes, my dear, I do. I tried to love him, and I did not
fail. I shall be happy, for I shall be busy. I am not
needed here any more, and so I am glad to go away into a
home of my own, feeling sure that you can fill my place; and
Maria knows my ways too well to let things go amiss. Now,
kiss me, and smooth my collar, for papa may call me down."

The sisters embraced and cried a little, as women usually
find it necessary to do at such interesting times; then
fell to planning the wedding outfit, and deciding between
the "light silk and white bonnet," or the "handsome travelling
suit."

Miss Yule made a great sacrifice to the proprieties by
relinquishing her desire for a stately wedding, and much
to Sylvia's surprise and relief, insisted that, as the family
was then situated, it was best to have no stir or parade,
but to be married quietly at church and slip unostentatiously
out of the old life into the new. Her will was law,
and as the elderly bridegroom felt that there was no time
to spare, and the measles continued to go about seeking
whom they might devour, Prue did not keep him waiting
long. "Three weeks is very little time, and nothing will
be properly done, for one must have everything new when
one is married of course, and mantua-makers are but mortal
women (exorbitant in their charges this season, I assure[266]
you), so be patient, Gamaliel, and spend the time in teaching
my little ones to love me before I come."

"My dearest creature, I will." And well did the enamored
gentleman perform his promise.

Prue kept hers so punctually that she was married with
the bastings in her wedding gown and two dozen pocket-handkerchiefs
still unhemmed; facts which disturbed her
even during the ceremony. A quiet time throughout; and
after a sober feast, a tearful farewell, Mrs. Gamaliel Bliss
departed, leaving a great void behind and carrying joy to
the heart of her spouse, comfort to the souls of the excited
nine, destruction to the "High Life Below Stairs," and
order, peace, and plenty to the realm over which she was
to know a long and prosperous reign.

Hardly had the excitement of this event subsided when
another occurred to keep Sylvia from melancholy and bring
an added satisfaction to her lonely days. Across the sea
there came to her a little book, bearing her name upon its
title-page. Quaintly printed, and bound in some foreign
style, plain and unassuming without, but very rich within,
for there she found Warwick's Essays, and between each
of these one of the poems from Moor's Diary. Far away
there in Switzerland they had devised this pleasure for her,
and done honor to the woman whom they both loved, by
dedicating to her the first fruits of their lives. "Alpen
Rosen" was its title, and none could have better suited it
in Sylvia's eyes, for to her Warwick was the Alps and
Moor the roses. Each had helped the other; Warwick's
rugged prose gathered grace from Moor's poetry, and
Moor's smoothly flowing lines acquired power from Warwick's
prose. Each had given her his best, and very
proud was Sylvia of the little book, over which she pored[267]
day after day, living on and in it, eagerly collecting all
praises, resenting all censures, and thinking it the one perfect
volume in the world.

Others felt and acknowledged its worth as well, for
though fashionable libraries were not besieged by inquiries
for it, and no short-lived enthusiasm welcomed it, a place
was found for it on many study tables, where real work was
done. Innocent girls sang the songs and loved the poet,
while thoughtful women, looking deeper, honored the man.
Young men received the Essays as brave protests against
the evils of the times, and old men felt their faith in honor
and honesty revive. The wise saw great promise in it, and
the most critical could not deny its beauty and its power.

Early in autumn arrived a fresh delight; and Jessie's
little daughter became peacemaker as well as idol. Mark
forgave his enemies, and swore eternal friendship with all
mankind the first day of his baby's life; and when his sister
brought it to him he took both in his arms, making
atonement for many hasty words and hard thoughts by the
broken whisper       

"I have two little Sylvias now."

This wonderful being absorbed both households, from
grandpapa to the deposed sovereign Tilly, whom Sylvia
called her own, and kept much with her; while Prue threatened
to cause a rise in the price of stationery by the daily
and copious letters full of warning and advice which she
sent, feeling herself a mother in Israel among her tribe of
nine, now safely carried through the Red Sea of scarlatina.
Happy faces made perpetual sunshine round the little Sylvia,
but to none was she so dear a boon as to her young
god-mother. Jessie became a trifle jealous of "old Sylvia,"
as she now called herself, for she almost lived in baby's[268]
nursery; hurrying over in time to assist at its morning
ablutions, hovering about its crib when it slept, daily discovering
beauties invisible even to its mother's eyes, and
working early and late on dainty garments, rich in the embroidery
which she now thanked Prue for teaching her
against her will. The touch of the baby hands seemed to
heal her sore heart; the sound of the baby voice, even
when most unmusical, had a soothing effect upon her nerves;
the tender cares its helplessness demanded absorbed her
thoughts, and kept her happy in a new world whose delights
she had never known till now.

From this time a restful expression replaced the patient
hopelessness her face had worn before, and in the lullabys
she sang the listeners caught echoes of the cheerful voice
they had never thought to hear again. Gay she was not,
but serene. Quiet was all she asked; and shunning society
seemed happiest to sit at home with baby and its gentle
mother, with Mark, now painting as if inspired, or with her
father, who relinquished business and devoted himself to
her. A pleasant pause seemed to have come after troublous
days; a tranquil hush in which she sat waiting for what
time should bring her. But as she waited the woman
seemed to bloom more beautifully than the girl had done.
Light and color revisited her countenance clearer and deeper
than of old; fine lines ennobled features faulty in themselves;
and the indescribable refinement of a deep inward
life made itself manifest in look, speech, and gesture, giving
promise of a gracious womanhood.

Mr. Yule augured well from this repose, and believed the
dawning loveliness to be a herald of returning love. He
was thinking hopeful thoughts one day as he sat writing to
Moor, whose faithful correspondent he had become, when[269]
Sylvia came in with one of the few notes she sent her husband
while away.

"Just in time. God bless me, child! what is it?"

Well might he exclaim, for in his daughter's face he saw
an expression which caused his hope to suddenly become a
glad belief. Her lips smiled, though in her eyes there lay
a shadow which he could not comprehend, and her answer
did not enlighten him as she put her arm about his neck
and laid her slip of paper in his hand.

"Enclose my note, and send the letter; then, father, we
will talk."




CHAPTER XX.

COME.


In a small Italian town not far from Rome, a traveller[270]
stood listening to an account of a battle lately fought near
by, in which the town had suffered much, yet been forever
honored in the eyes of its inhabitants, by having been the
headquarters of the Hero of Italy. An inquiry of the traveller's
concerning a countryman of whom he was in search,
created a sensation at the little inn, and elicited the story
of the battle, one incident of which was still the all-absorbing
topic with the excited villagers. This was the incident
which one of the group related with the dramatic
effects of a language composed almost as much of gesture
as of words, and an audience as picturesque as could well
be conceived.

While the fight was raging on the distant plain, a troop
of marauding Croats dashed into the town, whose defenders,
although outnumbered, contested every inch of ground, while
slowly driven back toward the convent, the despoiling of
which was the object of the attack. This convent was both
hospital and refuge, for there were gathered women and
children, the sick, the wounded, and the old. To secure
the safety of these rather than of the sacred relics, the
Italians were bent on holding the town till the reinforcement
for which they had sent could come up. It was a[271]
question of time, and every moment brought nearer the destruction
of the helpless garrison, trembling behind the
convent walls. A brutal massacre was in store for them if
no help came; and remembering this the red-shirted Garibaldians
fought as if they well deserved their sobriquet of
"Scarlet Demons."

Help did come, not from below, but from above. Suddenly
a cannon thundered royally, and down the narrow
street rushed a deathful defiance, carrying disorder and
dismay to the assailants, joy and wonder to the nearly exhausted
defenders. Wonder, for well they knew the gun
had stood silent and unmanned since the retreat of the
enemy two days before, and this unexpected answer to their
prayers seemed Heaven-sent. Those below looked up as
they fought, those above looked down as they feared, and
midway between all saw that a single man held the gun.
A stalwart figure, bareheaded, stern faced, sinewy armed,
fitfully seen through clouds of smoke and flashes of fire,
working with a silent energy that seemed almost superhuman
to the eyes of the superstitious souls, who believed they
saw and heard the convent's patron saint proclaiming their
salvation with a mighty voice.

This belief inspired the Italians, caused a panic among
the Croats, and saved the town. A few rounds turned the
scale, the pursued became the pursuers, and when the reinforcement
arrived there was little for it to do but join in
the rejoicing and salute the brave cannoneer, who proved to
be no saint, but a stranger come to watch the battle, and
thus opportunely lend his aid.

Enthusiastic were the demonstrations; vivas, blessings,
tears, handkissing, and invocation of all the saints in the
calendar, till it was discovered that the unknown gentleman[272]
had a bullet in his breast and was in need of instant help.
Whereupon the women, clustering about him like bees, bore
him away to the wounded ward, where the inmates rose up
in their beds to welcome him, and the clamorous crowd
were with difficulty persuaded to relinquish him to the
priest, the surgeon, and the rest he needed. Nor was this
all; the crowning glory of the event to the villagers was the
coming of the Chief at nightfall, and the scene about the
stranger's bed. Here the narrator glowed with pride, the
women in the group began to sob, and the men took off
their caps, with black eyes glittering through their tears.

"Excellenza, he who had fought for us like a tempest,
an angel of doom, lay there beside my cousin Beppo, who
was past help and is now in holy Paradise       Speranza was
washing the smoke and powder from him, the wound was
easy       death of my soul! may he who gave it die unconfessed!
See you, I am there, I watch him, the friend of
Excellenza, the great still man who smiled but said no word
to us. Then comes the Chief,       silenzio, till I finish!       he
comes, they have told him, he stays at the bed, he looks
down, the fine eye shines, he takes the hand, he says low       'I
thank you,'       he lays his cloak,       the gray cloak
we know and love so well       over the wounded breast,
and so goes on. We cry out, but what does the friend?
Behold! he lifts himself, he lays the cloak upon my Beppo,
he says in that so broken way of his       'Comrade, the
honor is for you who gave your life for him, I give but a
single hour.' Beppo saw, heard, comprehended; thanked
him with a glance, and rose up to die crying, 'Viva Italia!
Viva Garibaldi!'"

      



      


The cry was caught up by all the listeners in a whirlwind
of enthusiastic loyalty, and the stranger joined in it, thrilled
with an equal love and honor for the Patriot Soldier, whose[273]
name upon Italian lips means liberty.

"Where is he now, this friend of mine, so nearly lost,
so happily found?"

A dozen hands pointed to the convent, a dozen brown
faces lighted up, and a dozen eager voices poured out directions,
messages, and benedictions in a breath. Ordering his
carriage to follow presently, the traveller rapidly climbed
the steep road, guided by signs he could not well mistake.
The convent gate stood open, and he paused for no permission
to enter, for looking through it, down the green
vista of an orchard path, he saw his friend and sprang to
meet him.

"Adam!"

"Geoffrey!"

"Truant that you are, to desert me for ten days, and
only let me find you when you have no need of me."

"I always need you, but am not always needed. I went
away because the old restlessness came upon me in that
dead city Rome. You were happy there, but I scented
war, followed and found it by instinct, and have had enough
of it. Look at my hands."

He laughed as he showed them, still bruised and blackened
with the hard usage they had received; nothing else
but a paler shade of color from loss of blood, showed that
he had passed through any suffering or danger.

"Brave hands, I honor them for all their grime. Tell
me about it, Adam; show me the wound; describe the scene,
I want to hear it in calm English."

But Warwick was slow to do so being the hero of the
tale, and very brief was the reply Moor got.

"I came to watch, but found work ready for me. It is[274]
not clear to me even now what I did, nor how I did it. One
of my Berserker rages possessed me I fancy; my nerves
and muscles seemed made of steel and gutta percha; the
smell of powder intoxicated, and the sense of power was
grand. The fire, the smoke, the din were all delicious, and
I felt like a giant, as I wielded that great weapon, dealing
many deaths with a single pair of hands."

"The savage in you got the mastery just then; I've seen
it, and have often wondered how you managed to control it
so well. Now it has had a holiday and made a hero of you."

"The savage is better out than in, and any man may be
a hero if he will. What have you been doing since I left
you poring over pictures in a mouldy palace?"

"You think to slip away from the subject, do you? and
after facing death at a cannon's breach expect me to be
satisfied with an ordinary greeting? I won't have it; I
insist upon asking as many questions as I like, hearing about
the wound and seeing if it is doing well. Where is it?"

Warwick showed it, a little purple spot above his heart.
Moor's face grew anxious as he looked, but cleared again
as he examined it, for the ball had gone upward and the
wholesome flesh was already healing fast.

"Too near, Adam, but thank God it was no nearer. A
little lower and I might have looked for you in vain."

"This heart of mine is a tough organ, bullet-proof, I dare
say, though I wear no breastplate."

"But this!" Involuntarily Moor's eye asked the question
his lips did not utter as he touched a worn and faded
case hanging on the broad breast before him. Silently
Warwick opened it, showing not Sylvia's face but that of an
old woman, rudely drawn in sepia; the brown tints bringing
out the marked features as no softer hue could have[275]
done, and giving to each line a depth of expression that
made the serious countenance singularly lifelike and attractive.

Now Moor saw where Warwick got both keen eyes and
tender mouth, as well as all the gentler traits that softened
his strong character; and felt that no other woman ever
had or ever would hold so dear a place as the old mother
whose likeness he had drawn and hung where other men
wear images of mistress or of wife. With a glance as full
of penitence as the other had been of disquiet, Moor laid
back the little case, drew bandage and blouse over both
wound and picture, and linked his arm in Warwick's as he
asked       

"Who shot you?"

"How can I tell? I knew nothing of it till that flock
of women fell to kissing these dirty hands of mine; then I
was conscious of a stinging pain in my shoulder, and a
warm stream trickling down my side. I looked to see
what was amiss, whereat the good souls set up a shriek,
took possession of me, and for half an hour wept and
wailed over me in a frenzy of emotion and good-will that
kept me merry in spite of the surgeon's probes and the
priest's prayers. The appellations showered upon me would
have startled even your ears, accustomed to soft words.
Were you ever called 'core of my heart,' 'sun of my soul,'
or 'cup of gold'?"

"Cannonading suits your spirits excellently; I remember
your telling me that you had tried and liked it. But
there is to be no more of it, I have other plans for you.
Before I mention them tell me of the interview with Garibaldi."

"That now is a thing to ask one about; a thing to talk[276]
of and take pride in all one's days. I was half asleep and
thought myself dreaming till he spoke. A right noble face,
Geoffrey       full of thought and power; the look of one
born to command others because master of himself. A
square strong frame; no decorations, no parade; dressed
like his men, yet as much the chief as if he wore a dozen
orders on his scarlet shirt."

"Where is the cloak? I want to see and touch it; surely
you kept it as a relic?"

"Not I. Having seen the man, what do I care for the
garment that covered him. I keep the hand shake, the
'Grazia, grazia,' for my share. Poor Beppo lies buried in
the hero's cloak."

"I grudge it to him, every inch of it, for not having
seen the man I do desire the garment. Who but you would
have done it?"

Warwick smiled, knowing that his friend was well pleased
with him for all his murmuring. They walked in silence
till Moor abruptly asked       

"When can you travel, Adam?"

"I was coming back to you to-morrow."

"Are you sure it is safe?"

"Quite sure; ten days is enough to waste upon a scratch
like this."

"Come now, I cannot wait till to-morrow."

"Very good. Can you stop till I get my hat?"

"You don't ask me why I am in such haste."

Moor's tone caused Warwick to pause and look at him.
Joy, impatience, anxiety, contended with each other in his
countenance; and as if unable to tell the cause himself, he
put a little paper into the other's hand. Only three words
were contained in it, but they caused Warwick's face to[277]
kindle with all the joy betrayed in that of his friend, none
of the impatience nor anxiety.

"What can I say to show you my content? The months
have seemed very long to you, but now comes the reward.
The blessed little letter! so like herself; the slender slip,
the delicate handwriting, the three happy words,       'Geoffrey,
come home.'"

Moor did not speak, but still looked up anxiously, inquiringly;
and Warwick answered with a glance he could
not doubt.

"Have no fears for me. I share the joy as heartily as
I shared the sorrow; neither can separate us any more."

"Thank heaven for that! But, Adam, may I accept
this good gift and be sure I am not robbing you again?
You never speak of the past, how is it with you now?"

"Quite well and happy; the pain is gone, the peace remains.
I would not have it otherwise. Six months have
cured the selfishness of love, and left the satisfaction which
nothing can change or take away."

"But Sylvia, what of her, Adam?"

"Henceforth, Sylvia and Ottila are only fair illustrations
of the two extremes of love. I am glad to have known
both; each has helped me, and each will be remembered
while I live. But having gained the experience I can
relinquish the unconscious bestowers of it, if it is not best
to keep them. Believe that I do this without regret,
and freely enjoy the happiness that comes to you."

"I will, but not as I once should; for though I feel that
you need neither sympathy nor pity, still, I seem to take so
much and leave you nothing."

"You leave me myself, better and humbler than before.
In the fierce half hour I lived not long ago, I think a great[278]
and needful change was wrought in me. All lives are full
of such, coming when least looked for, working out the end
through unexpected means. The restless, domineering devil
that haunted me was cast out then; and during the quiet time
that followed a new spirit entered in and took possession."

"What is it, Adam?"

"I cannot tell, yet I welcome it. This peaceful mood
may not last perhaps, but it brings me that rare moment       pity
that it is so rare, and but a moment       when we seem
to see temptation at our feet; when we are conscious of a
willingness to leave all in God's hand, ready for whatever
He may send; feeling that whether it be suffering or joy
we shall see the Giver in the gift, and when He calls can
answer cheerfully 'Lord here am I.'"

It was a rare moment, and in it Moor for the first time
clearly saw the desire and design of his friend's life; saw
it because it was accomplished, and for the instant Adam
Warwick was what he aspired to be. A goodly man, whose
stalwart body seemed a fit home for a strong soul, wise with
the wisdom of a deep experience, genial with the virtues of
an upright life, devout with that humble yet valiant piety
which comes through hard-won victories over "the world,
the flesh, and the devil." Despite the hope that warmed
his heart, Moor felt poor beside him, as a new reverence
warmed the old affection. His face showed it though he
did not speak, and Warwick laid an arm about his shoulders
as he had often done of late when they were alone, drawing
him gently on again, as he said, with a touch of playfulness
to set both at ease       

"Tell me your plans, 'my cup of gold,' and let me lend
a hand toward filling you brimful of happiness. You are
going home?"[279]

"At once; you also."

"Is it best?"

"Yes; you came for me, I stay for you, and Sylvia waits
for both."

"She says nothing of me in this short, sweet note of
hers;" and Warwick smoothed it carefully in his large
hand, eyeing it as if he wished there were some little word
for him.

"True, but in the few letters she has written there always
comes a message to you, though you never write a
line; nor would you go to her now had she sent for you
alone; she knew that, and sends for me, sure that you will
follow."

"Being a woman she cannot quite forgive me for loving
her too well to make her miserable. Dear soul, she will
never know how much it cost me, but I knew that my only
safety lay in flight. Tell her so a long while hence."

"You shall do it yourself, for you are coming home with
me."

"What to do there?"

"All you ever did; walk up and down the face of the
earth, waxing in power and virtue, and coming often to us
when we get fairly back into our former ways, for you are
still the house friend."

"I was wondering, as I walked here, what my next summons
would be, when lo, you came. Go on, I'll follow
you; one could hardly have a better guide."

"You are sure you are able, Adam?"

"Shall I uproot a tree or fling you over the wall to convince
you, you motherly body? I am nearly whole again,
and a breath of sea air will complete the cure. Let me cover
my head, say farewell to the good Sisters, and I shall be[280]
glad to slip away without further demonstrations from the
volcanoes below there."

Laying one hand on the low wall, Warwick vaulted over
with a backward glance at Moor, who followed to the gateway,
there to wait till the adieux were over. Very brief
they were, and presently Warwick reappeared, evidently
touched yet ill-pleased at something, for he both smiled and
frowned as he paused on the threshold as if loth to go. A
little white goat came skipping from the orchard, and seeing
the stranger took refuge at Warwick's knee. The act
of the creature seemed to suggest a thought to the man.
Pulling off the gay handkerchief some grateful woman had
knotted round his neck, he fastened it about the goat's,
having secured something in one end, then rose as if
content.

"What are you doing?" called Moor, wondering at this
arrangement.

"Widening the narrow entrance into heaven set apart for
rich men unless they leave their substance behind, as I am
trying to do. The kind creatures cannot refuse it now; so
trot away to your mistress, little Nanna, and tell no tales
as you go."

As the goat went tapping up the steps a stir within announced
the dreaded demonstration. Warwick did not
seem to hear it; he stood looking far across the trampled
plain and ruined town toward the mountains shining white
against the deep Italian sky. A rapt, far-reaching look, as
if he saw beyond the purple wall, and seeing forgot the
present in some vision of the future.

"Come, Adam! I am waiting."

His eye came back, the lost look passed, and cheerily he
answered[281]       

"I am ready."

A fortnight later in that dark hour before the dawn,
with a murky sky above them, a hungry sea below them,
the two stood together the last to leave a sinking ship.

"Room for one more, choose quick!" shouted a hoarse
voice from the boat tossing underneath, freighted to the
water's edge with trembling lives.

"Go, Geoffrey, Sylvia is waiting."

"Not without you, Adam."

"But you are exhausted; I can bear a rough hour better
than yourself, and morning will bring help."

"It may not. Go, I am the lesser loss."

"What folly! I will force you to it; steady there, he
is coming."

"Push off, I am not coming."

In times like that, few pause for pity or persuasion; the
instinct of self-preservation rules supreme, and each is for
himself, except those in whom love of another is stronger
than love of life. Even while the friends generously contended
the boat was swept away, and they were left alone
in the deserted ship, swiftly making its last voyage downward.
Spent with a day of intense excitement, and sick
with hope deferred, Moor leaned on Warwick, feeling that
it was adding bitterness to death to die in sight of shore.
But Warwick never knew despair; passive submission was
not in his power while anything remained to do or dare,
and even then he did not cease to hope. It was certain
death to linger there; other boats less heavily laden had
put off before, and might drift across their track; wreckers
waiting on the shore might hear and help; at least it were
better to die bravely and not "strike sail to a fear." About
his waist still hung a fragment of the rope which had low[282]ered
more than one baby to its mother's arms; before them
the shattered taffrail rose and fell as the waves beat over it.
Wrenching a spar away he lashed Moor to it, explaining his
purpose as he worked. There was only rope enough for
one, and in the darkness Moor believed that Warwick had
taken equal precautions for himself.

"Now Geoffrey your hand, and when the next wave
ebbs let us follow it. If we are parted and you see her
first tell her I remembered, and give her this."

In the black night with only Heaven to see them the
men kissed tenderly as women, then hand in hand sprang
out into the sea. Drenched and blinded they struggled up
after the first plunge, and struck out for the shore, guided
by the thunder of the surf they had listened to for twelve
long hours, as it broke against the beach, and brought no
help on its receding billows. Soon Warwick was the only
one who struggled, for Moor's strength was gone, and he
clung half conscious to the spar, tossing from wave to wave,
a piteous plaything for the sea.

"I see a light!       they must take you in       hold fast,
I'll save you for the little wife at home."

Moor heard but two words, "wife" and "home;" strained
his dim eyes to see the light, spent his last grain of
strength to reach it, and in the act lost consciousness, whispering       "She
will thank you," as his head fell against
Warwick's breast and lay there, heavy and still. Lifting
himself above the spar, Adam lent the full power of his
voice to the shout he sent ringing through the storm. He
did not call in vain, a friendly wind took the cry to human
ears, a relenting wave swept them within the reach of human
aid, and the boat's crew, pausing involuntarily, saw a
hand clutch the suspended oar, a face flash up from the[283]
black water, and heard a breathless voice issue the command       

"Take in this man! he saved you for your wives, save
him for his."

One resolute will can sway a panic-stricken multitude;
it did so then. The boat was rocking in the long swell of
the sea; a moment and the coming wave would sweep them
far apart. A woman sobbed, and as if moved by one impulse
four sturdy arms clutched and drew Moor in. While
loosening his friend Warwick had forgotten himself, and
the spar was gone. He knew it, but the rest believed that
they left the strong man a chance of life equal to their own
in that overladen boat. Yet in the memories of all who
caught that last glimpse of him there long remained the
recollection of a dauntless face floating out into the night,
a steady voice calling through the gale, "A good voyage,
comrades!" as he turned away to enter port before them.

Wide was the sea and pitiless the storm, but neither
could dismay the unconquerable spirit of the man who
fought against the elements as bravely as if they were adversaries
of mortal mould, and might be vanquished in the
end. But it was not to be; soon he felt it, accepted it,
turned his face upward toward the sky, where one star
shone, and when Death whispered "Come!" answered as
cheerily as to that other friend, "I am ready." Then with
a parting thought for the man he had saved, the woman
he had loved, the promise he had kept, a great and tender
heart went down into the sea.



Sometimes the Sculptor, whose workshop is the world,
fuses many metals and casts a noble statue; leaves it for
humanity to criticise, and when time has mellowed both[284]
beauties and blemishes, removes it to that inner studio,
there to be carved in enduring marble.

Adam Warwick was such an one; with much alloy and
many flaws; but beneath all defects the Master's eye saw the
grand lines that were to serve as models for the perfect man,
and when the design had passed through all necessary processes,       the
mould of clay, the furnace fire, the test of
time,       He washed the dust away, and pronounced it ready
for the marble.




CHAPTER XXI.

OUT OF THE SHADOW.


They had been together for an hour, the husband and[285]
the wife. The first excitement was now over, and Sylvia
stood behind him tearless and tranquil, while Moor, looking
like a man out of whom the sea had drenched both strength
and spirit, leaned his weary head against her, trying to
accept the great loss, enjoy the great gain which had befallen
him. Hitherto all their talk had been of Warwick,
and as Moor concluded the history of the months so tragically
ended, for the first time he ventured to express wonder
at the calmness with which his hearer received the sad
story.

"How quietly you listen to words which it wrings my
heart to utter. Have you wept your tears dry, or do you
still cling to hope?"

"No, I feel that we shall never see him any more; but
I have no desire to weep, for tears and lamentations do not
belong to him. He died a beautiful, a noble death; the
sea is a fitting grave for him, and it is pleasant to think of
him asleep there, quiet at last."

"I cannot feel so; I find it hard to think of him as dead;
he was so full of life, so fit to live."

"And therefore fit to die. Imagine him as I do, enjoying
the larger life he longed for, and growing to be the[286]
strong, sweet soul whose foreshadowing we saw and loved
so here."

"Sylvia, I have told you of the beautiful change which
befell him in those last days, and now I see the same in
you. Are you, too, about to leave me when I have just
recovered you?"

"I shall stay with you all my life."

"Then Adam was less to you than you believed, and I
am more?"

"Nothing is changed. Adam is all he ever was to me,
you are all you ever can be; but I       "

"Then why send for me? Why say you will stay with
me all your life? Sylvia, for God's sake, let there be no
more delusion or deceit!"

"Never again! I will tell you; I meant to do it at
once, but it is so hard       "

She turned her face away, and for a moment neither
stirred. Then drawing his head to its former resting-place
she touched it very tenderly, seeing how many white threads
shone among the brown; and as her hand went to and fro
with an inexpressibly soothing gesture, she said, in a tone
whose quietude controlled his agitation like a spell       

"Long ago, in my great trouble, Faith told me that for
every human effort or affliction there were two friendly
helpers, Time and Death. The first has taught me more
gently than I deserved; has made me humble, and given
me hope that through my errors I may draw virtue from
repentance. But while I have been learning the lessons
time can teach, that other helper has told me to be ready
for its coming. Geoffrey, I sent for you because I knew
you would love to see me again before we must say the long
good by."[287]

"Oh, Sylvia! not that; anything but that. I cannot
bear it now!"

"Dear heart, be patient; lean on me, and let me help
you bear it, for it is inevitable."

"It shall not be! There must be some help, some hope.
God would not be so pitiless as to take both."

"I shall not leave you yet. He does not take me; it is
I, who, by wasting life, have lost the right to live."

"But is it so? I cannot make it true. You look so
beautiful, so blooming, and the future seemed so sure.
Sylvia, show it to me, if it must be."

She only turned her face to him, only held up her transparent
hand, and let him read the heavy truth. He did
so, for now he saw that the beauty and the bloom were
transitory as the glow of leaves that frost makes fairest as
they fall, and felt the full significance of the great change
which had come. He clung to her with a desperate yet
despairing hold, and she could only let the first passion of
his grief have way, soothing and sustaining, while her heart
bled and the draught was very bitter to her lips.

"Hush, love; be quiet for a little; and when you can
bear it better, I will tell you how it is with me."

"Tell me now; let me hear everything at once. When
did you know? How are you sure? Why keep it from
me all this time?"

"I have only known it for a little while, but I am very
sure, and I kept it from you that you might come happily
home, for knowledge of it would have lengthened every
mile, and made the journey one long anxiety. I could not
know that Adam would go first, and so make my task
doubly hard."

"Come to me, Sylvia; let me keep you while I may. I[288]
will not be violent; I will listen patiently, and through
everything remember you."

He did remember her, so thoughtfully, so tenderly, that
her little story flowed on uninterrupted by sigh or sob; and
while he held his grief in check, the balm of submission
comforted his sore heart. Sitting by him, sustaining and
sustained, she told the history of the last six months, till
just before the sending of the letter. She paused there a
moment, then hurried on, gradually losing the consciousness
of present emotion in the vivid memory of the past.

"You have no faith in dreams; I have; and to a dream
I owe my sudden awakening to the truth. Thank and respect
it, for without its warning I might have remained in
ignorance of my state until it was too late to find and
bring you home."

"God bless the dream and keep the dreamer!"

"This was a strange and solemn vision; one to remember
and to love for its beautiful interpretation of the prophecy
that used to awe and sadden me, but never can again.
I dreamed that the last day of the world had come. I
stood on a shadowy house-top in a shadowy city, and all
around me far as eye could reach thronged myriads of people,
till the earth seemed white with human faces. All were
mute and motionless, as if fixed in a trance of expectation,
for none knew how the end would come. Utter silence
filled the world, and across the sky a vast curtain of the
blackest cloud was falling, blotting out face after face and
leaving the world a blank. In that universal gloom and
stillness, far above me in the heavens I saw the pale outlines
of a word stretching from horizon to horizon. Letter
after letter came out full and clear, till all across the sky,
burning with a ruddy glory stronger than the sun, shone[289]
the great word Amen. As the last letter reached its bright
perfection, a long waft of wind broke over me like a universal
sigh of hope from human hearts. For far away on
the horizon's edge all saw a line of light that widened
as they looked, and through that rift, between the dark
earth and the darker sky, rolled in a softly flowing sea.
Wave after wave came on, so wide, so cool, so still. None
trembled at their approach, none shrunk from their embrace,
but all turned toward that ocean with a mighty rush, all
faces glowed in its splendor, and million after million vanished
with longing eyes fixed on the arch of light through
which the ebbing sea would float them when its work was
done. I felt no fear, only the deepest awe, for I seemed
such an infinitesimal atom of the countless host that I forgot
myself. Nearer and nearer came the flood, till its breath
blew on my cheeks, and I, too, leaned to meet it, longing
to be taken. A great wave rolled up before me, and through
its soft glimmer I saw a beautiful, benignant face regarding
me. Then I knew that each and all had seen the same,
and losing fear in love were glad to go. The joyful yearning
woke me as the wave seemed to break at my feet, and
ebbing leave me still alive."

"And that is all? Only a dream, a foreboding fancy,
Sylvia?"

"When I woke my hair was damp on my forehead, my
breath quite still, my heart so cold I felt as if death had
indeed been near me and left its chill behind. So strong
was the impression of the dream, so perfect was the similitude
between the sensations I had experienced then, and
more than once awake, that I felt that something was seriously
wrong with me."

"You had been ill then?"[290]

"Not consciously, not suffering any pain, but consumed
with an inward fever that would not burn itself away.
I used to have a touch of it in the evenings, you remember;
but now it burned all day, making me look strong and rosy,
yet leaving me so worn out at night that no sleep seemed
to restore me. A few weak and weary hours, then the fire
was rekindled and the false strength, color, spirits, returned
to deceive myself, and those about me, for another day."

"Did you tell no one of this, Sylvia?"

"Not at first, because I fancied it a mental ill. I had
thought so much, so deeply, it seemed but natural that I
should be tired. I tried to rest myself by laying all my
cares and sorrows in God's hand, and waiting patiently to
be shown the end. I see it now, but for a time I could
only sit and wait; and while I did so my soul grew strong
but my ill-used body failed. The dream came, and in the
stillness of that night I felt a strange assurance that I
should see my mother soon."

"Dear, what did you do?"

"I determined to discover if I had deceived myself with
a superstitious fancy, or learned a fateful fact in my own
mysterious way. If it were false, no one would be made
anxious by it; if true, possessing the first knowledge of it
would enable me to comfort others. I went privately to
town and consulted the famous physician who has grown
gray in the study of disease."

"Did you go alone, Sylvia?"

"Yes, alone. I am braver than I used to be, and have
learned never to feel quite alone. I found a grave, stern-looking
man; I told him that I wished to know the entire
truth whatever it might be, and that he need not fear to
tell me because I was prepared for it. He asked many[291]
questions, thought a little, and was very slow to speak.
Then I saw how it would be, but urged him to set my mind
at rest. His stern old face grew very pitiful as he took my
hand and answered gently       'My child, go home and prepare
to die.'"

"Good God, how cruel! Sylvia, how did you bear it?"

"At first the earth seemed to slip away from under me,
and time to stand still. Then I was myself again, and could
listen steadily to all he said. It was only this,       I had
been born with a strong nature in a feeble frame, had lived
too fast, wasted health ignorantly, and was past help."

"Could he do nothing for you?"

"Nothing but tell me how to husband my remaining
strength, and make the end easy by the care that would
have kept me longer had I known this sooner."

"And no one saw your danger; no one warned you of it;
and I was away!"

"Father could not see it, for I looked well and tried to
think I felt so. Mark and Jessie were absorbed in baby
Sylvia, and Prue was gone. You might have seen and
helped me, for you have the intuitions of a woman in many
things, but I could not send for you then because I could
not give you what you asked. Was it wrong to call you
when I did, and try to make the hard fact easier to bear by
telling it myself?"

"Heaven bless you for it, Sylvia. It was truly generous
and kind. I never could have forgiven you had you denied
me the happiness of seeing you again, and you have robbed
the truth of half its bitter pain by telling it yourself."

A restful expression came into her face, and a sigh of
satisfaction proved how great was the relief of feeling that
for once her heart had prompted her aright. Moor let her[292]
rest a little, then asked with a look more pathetic than his
words       

"What am I to you now? Where is my home to be?"

"My friend forever, no more, no less; and your home is
here with us until I leave my father to your care. All this
pain and separation were in vain if we have not learned
that love can neither be forced nor feigned. While I endeavored
to do so, God did not help me, and I went deeper
and deeper into sorrow and wrong doing. When I dropped
all self-delusion and desperate striving, and stood still,
asking to be shown the right, then he put out his hand and
through much tribulation led me to convictions that I dare
not disobey. Our friendship may be a happy one if we
accept and use it as we should. Let it be so, and for the
little while that I remain, let us live honestly before heaven
and take no thought for the world's opinion."

Adam might have owned the glance she bent upon her
husband, so clear, so steadfast was it; but the earnestness
was all her own, and blended with it a new strength
that seemed a late compensation for lost love and waning
life. Remembering the price both had paid for it, Moor
gratefully accepted the costly friendship offered him, and
soon acknowledged both its beauty and its worth.

"One question more; Sylvia, how long?"

It was very hard to answer, but folding the sharp fact
in the gentlest fancy that appeared to her she gave him the
whole truth.

"I shall not see the spring again, but it will be a pleasant
time to lay me underneath the flowers."

Sylvia had not known how to live, but now she proved
that she did know how to die. So beautifully were the two
made one, the winning girl, the deep-hearted woman, that[293]
she seemed the same beloved Sylvia, yet Sylvia strengthened,
purified, and perfected by the hard past, the solemn
present. Those about her felt and owned the unconscious
power, which we call the influence of character, and which
is the noblest that gives sovereignty to man or woman.

So cheerfully did she speak of it, so tranquilly did she
prepare to meet it, that death soon ceased to be an image of
grief or fear to those about her, and became a benignant
friend, who, when the mortal wearies, blesses it with a brief
sleep, that it may wake immortal. She would have no sad
sick-chamber, no mournful faces, no cessation of the wholesome
household cares and joys, that do so much to make
hearts strong and spirits happy. While strength remained,
she went her round of daily duties, doing each so lovingly,
that the most trivial became a delight, and taking unsuspected
thought for the comfort or the pleasure of those soon
to be left behind, so tenderly, that she could not seem lost to
them, even when she was gone.

Faith came to her, and as her hands became too weak for
anything but patient folding, every care slipped so quietly
into Faith's, that few perceived how fast she was laying
down the things of this world, and making ready to take
up those of the world to come. Her father was her
faithful shadow; bent and white-haired now, but growing
young at heart in spite of sorrow, for his daughter had in
truth become the blessing of his life. Mark and Jessie
brought their offering of love in little Sylvia's shape, and
the innocent consoler did her sweet work by making sunshine
in a shady place. But Moor was all in all to Sylvia,
and their friendship proved an abiding strength, for sorrow
made it very tender, sincerity ennobled it, and the coming
change sanctified it to them both.[294]

April came; and on her birthday, with a grateful heart,
Moor gathered the first snow-drops of the year. All day
they stood beside her couch, as fragile and as pale as she,
and many eyes had filled as loving fancies likened her to
the slender, transparent vase, the very spirit of a shape,
and the white flowers that had blossomed beautifully through
the snow. When the evening lamp was lighted, she took
the little posy in her hand, and lay with her eyes upon it,
listening to the book Moor read, for this hour always soothed
the unrest of the day. Very quiet was the pleasant room,
with no sounds in it but the soft flicker of the fire, the rustle
of Faith's needle, and the subdued music of the voice
that patiently went reading on, long after Sylvia's eyes had
closed, lest she should miss its murmur. For an hour she
seemed to sleep, so motionless, so colorless, that her father,
always sitting at her side, bent down at last to listen at her
lips. The lips smiled, the eyes unclosed, and she looked up
at him, with an expression as tender as tranquil.

"A long sleep and pleasant dreams that wake you smiling?"
he asked.

"Beautiful and happy thoughts, father; let me tell you
some of them. As I lay here, I fell to thinking of my life,
and at first it seemed the sorrowfullest failure I had ever
known. Whom had I made happy? What had I done
worth the doing? Where was the humble satisfaction that
should come hand in hand with death? At first I could
find no answers to my questions, and though my one and
twenty years do not seem long to live, I felt as if it would
have been better for us all if I had died, a new-born baby
in my mother's arms."

"My child, say anything but that, because it is I who
have made your life a failure."[295]

"Wait a little father, and you will see that it is a beautiful
success. I have given happiness, have done something
worth the doing; now I see a compensation for all seeming
loss, and heartily thank God that I did not die till I had
learned the true purpose of all lives. He knows that I say
these things humbly, that I claim no virtue for myself, and
have been a blind instrument in His hand, to illustrate
truths that will endure when I am forgotten. I have helped
Mark and Jessie, for, remembering me, they will feel
how blest they are in truly loving one another. They will
keep little Sylvia from making mistakes like mine, and the
household joys and sorrows we have known together, will
teach Mark to make his talent a delight to many, by letting
art interpret nature."

Her brother standing behind her stooped and kissed her,
saying through his tears       

"I shall remember, dear."

"I have helped Geoffrey, I believe. He lived too much
in the affections, till through me he learned that none may
live for love alone. Genius will be born of grief, and
he will put his sorrow into song to touch and teach other
hearts more gently than his own has been, so growing a
nobler and a richer man for the great cross of his life."

Calm, with the calmness of a grief too deep for tears, and
strong in a devout belief, Moor gave his testimony as she
paused.

"I shall endeavor, and now I am as grateful for the pain
as for the joy, because together they will show me how to
live, and when I have learned that I shall be ready to come
to you."

"I think I have served Adam. He needed gentleness
as Geoffrey needed strength, and I, unworthy as I am, woke[296]
that deep heart of his and made it a fitter mate for his
great soul. To us it seems as if he had left his work unfinished,
but God knew best, and when he was needed for a
better work he went to find it. Yet I am sure that he was
worthier of eternal life for having known the discipline of
love."

There was no voice to answer now, but Sylvia felt that
she would receive it very soon and was content.

"Have you no lesson for your father? The old man
needs it most."

She laid her thin hand tenderly on his, that if her words
should bring reproach, she might seem to share it with him.

"Yes, father, this. That if the chief desire of the heart
is for the right, it is possible for any human being, through
all trials, temptations, and mistakes, to bring good out of
evil, hope from despair, success from defeat, and come at
last to know an hour as beautiful and blest as this."

Who could doubt that she had learned the lesson, when
from the ruins of the perishable body the imperishable soul
rose steadfast and serene, proving that after the long bewilderment
of life and love it had attained the eternal
peace.

The room grew very still, and while those about her pondered
her words with natural tears, Sylvia lay looking up
at a lovely picture that seemed leaning down to offer her
again the happiest memory of her youth. It was a painting
of the moonlight voyage down the river. Mark had given it
that day, and now when the longer, sadder voyage was
nearly over, she regarded it with a tender pleasure. The
moon shone full on Warwick, looking out straight and
strong before him with the vigilant expression native to his
face; a fit helmsman to guide the boat along that rapid[297]
stream. Mark seemed pausing to watch the oars silvered
by the light, and their reflections wavy with the current.
Moor, seen in shadow, leaned upon his hand, as if watching
Sylvia, a quiet figure, full of grace and color, couched
under the green arch. On either hand the summer woods
made vernal gloom, behind the cliffs rose sharply up against
the blue, and all before wound a shining road, along which
the boat seemed floating like a bird on slender wings between
two skies.

So long she lay forgetful of herself and all about her,
that Moor saw she needed rest, for the breath fluttered on
her lips, the flowers had fallen one by one, and her face
wore the weary yet happy look of some patient child waiting
for its lullaby.

"Dear, you have talked enough; let me take you up
now, lest the pleasant day be spoiled by a sleepless night."

"I am ready, yet I love to stay among you all, for in my
sleep I seem to drift so far away I never quite come back.
Good night, good night; I shall see you in the morning."

With a smile, a kiss for all, they saw her fold her arms
about her husband's neck, and lay down her head as if she
never cared to lift it up again. The little journey was
both a pleasure and pain to them, for each night the way
seemed longer to Sylvia, and though the burden lightened
the bearer grew more heavy-hearted. It was a silent passage
now, for neither spoke, except when one asked tenderly,
"Are you easy, love?" and the other answered, with a
breath that chilled his cheek, "Quite happy, quite content."

So, cradled on the heart that loved her best, Sylvia was
gently carried to the end of her short pilgrimage, and
when her husband laid her down the morning had already
dawned.




      
      

FAITH GARTNEY'S GIRLHOOD,

By the Author of "The Gayworthys," "Boys at Chequasset"

1 vol., 12mo. Elegant fancy cloth. Price $1.75.



This charming story fills a void long felt for something for
a young girl, growing into womanhood, to read.

It depicts that bewitching period in life, lying between
FOURTEEN and TWENTY, with its noble aspirations, and fresh
enthusiasms. It is written by a very accomplished lady, and
is "the best book ever written for girls."

A lady of rare culture says,       

"'Faith Gartney's Girlhood,' is a noble, good work, that
could only have been accomplished by an elevated mind
united to a chaste, tender heart. From the first page to the
last, the impression is received of a life which has been
lived; the characters are genuine, well drawn, skilfully
presented; they are received at once with kind, friendly
greeting, and followed with interest, till the last page compels
a reluctant farewell.

"'The book is written for girls, growing as they grow to
womanhood.' The story has an interest, far beyond that
found in modern romances of the day, conveyed in pure,
refined language; suggestive, pleasing thoughts are unfolded
on every page; the reflective and descriptive passages are
natural, simple, and exquisitely finished.

"In these days, when the tendency of society is to educate
girls for heartless, aimless, factitious life, a book like this is
to be welcomed and gratefully received. Wherever it is
read, it will be retained as a thoughtful, suggestive       if
silent       friend."



      
      
      
MAINSTONE'S HOUSEKEEPER.

By Miss Eliza Meteyard (Silverpen).

1 vol., 12mo. Elegant fancy cloth. Price $1.50.


Douglas Jerrold gave this distinguished English authoress
this "nom de plume," and her style has the point, brightness,
and delicacy which it suggests.       This is not a cook book as
the title might mislead some to suppose, but a fresh, vigorous,
powerful story of English country life, full of exquisite pictures
of rural scenery, with a plot which is managed with
great skill, and a surprise kept constantly ahead so that from
the opening to the close the interest never flags. There is
life in every page and a fresh, delicate, hearty sentiment pervades
the book that exhilarates and charms indescribably.

The heroine       Charlotte the housekeeper       is one of the
finest characters ever drawn, and merits unqualified commendation.

As a whole, for beauty of style and diction, passionate earnestness,
effective contrasts, distinctness of plot, unity, and
completeness, this novel is without a rival. It is a "midnight
darling" that Charles Lamb would have exulted in,
and perhaps the best as yet produced from a woman's pen.


      
      
      
SIMPLICITY AND FASCINATION.

BY ANNE BEALE.

1 vol., 12mo. Elegant fancy cloth. Price $1.50.


It is not often that such a sound and yet readable English
novel is republished in America.

The due mean between flashiness and dulness is hard to
be attained, but we have it here.

There is neither a prosy page nor a sensational chapter
in it.

It is a nice book for a clean hearth and an easy chair.

It is a natural, healthy book, written by a living person,
about people of flesh and blood, who might have been our
neighbors, and of events, which might happen to anybody.
This is a great charm in a novel. This leaves a clean taste
in the mouth, and a delicious memory of the feast.

The tone of it is high and true, without being obtrusively
good. Such a book is as great a relief amid the sensational
stories of the day, as a quiet little bit of "still life" is to
the eye, after being blinded by the glaring colors of the French
school.

This novel reproduces that exquisite tone or flavor so hard
to express which permeates true English country life, and
gives to it a peculiar charm unlike any other, which one having
once seen and felt, lives as it were under a spell, and
would never willingly allow to fade from their memory.

Too much cannot be said in praise of Simplicity and Fascination.



      
      
      
PIQUE:

A Tale of the English Aristocracy.

1 vol., 12mo. Elegant fancy cloth. Price $ 1.50.


Three thousand eight hundred and seventy-six new books
were published in England this last year, which is about the
average number of past years.

Thirteen years ago Pique was first published in London,
and up to the present time, notwithstanding the enormous
number of new books issued, the effect of which is to crowd
the old ones out of sight, this remarkable novel has continued
to have a large sale.

This is the strongest praise that can be bestowed on any
book. It is not in the least "sensational," but relies solely
on its rare beauty of style and truthfulness to nature for its
popularity.

It has the merit of being amusing, pleasantly written, and
engrossing.

The characters being high-bred men and women, are
charming companions for an hour's solitude, and one puts the
book aside regretfully, even as one closes the eyes on a delicious
vision. The American edition has taken every one by
surprise, that so remarkably good a novel should have so
long escaped attention.

Every body is charmed with it, and its sale will continue
for years to come.



      
      
      
THE GAYWORTHYS.

By the author of "Faith Gartney's Girlhood," "Boys at
Chequasset."



American ladies and gentlemen travelling in England, are
amazed and delighted to find "an American Novel" welcomed
with such warmth and enthusiasm, by the "cultivated" and
"influential," in all parts of the Kingdom.

No American book since "Uncle Tom," is so universally
known, read, and talked about.

The London journals, without exception, have given it a cordial
welcome. Read what they say of it:       

"We wish to write our most appreciative word of this admirable and unexceptional
book. We feel while we read it that a new master of fiction has arisen....
We can well afford to wait a few years now, if at the end we are to receive
from the same pen a work of such a character and mark as 'The Gayworthys.'"       Eclectic
Journal.

"It is impossible not to welcome so genial a gift. Nothing so complete and delicately
beautiful has come to England from America since Hawthorne's death, and
there is more of America in 'The Gayworthys' than in 'The Scarlet Letter,' or
'The House with Seven Gables.' ... We know not where so much tender
feeling and wholesome thought are to be found together as in this history of the
fortunes of the Gayworthys."       Reader.

"'The Gayworthys' comes to us very seasonably, for it belongs to a class of
novels wanted more and more every day, yet daily growing scarcer. We have
therefore, a warmer welcome for the book before us as being a particularly favorable
specimen of its class. Without the exciting strength of wine, it offers to
feverish lips all the grateful coolness of the unfermented grape."       Pall
Mall Gazette.

"We have no misgivings in promising our readers a rich treat in 'The Gayworthys.' ...
'The Gayworthys' will become a great favorite."       Nonconformist.

"... The book is crowded with epigrams as incisive as this, yet incisive
without malice or bitterness, cutting not so much from the sharpness of the
thought as from its weight. There is deep kindliness in the following passage, as
well as deep insight.... The tone of the story, the curious sense of peace
and kindliness which it produces, comes out well in that extract, and the reader
quits it, feeling as he would have felt had he been gazing half an hour on that
scene       with more confidence alike in nature and humanity, less care for the noisy
rush of city life, and yet withal less fear of it."       Spectator.

"It is a pleasant book and will make for the producer friends."       Saturday
Review.

"We venture to say no one who begins the book will leave it unfinished, or will
deny that great additions have been made to his circle of acquaintance. He has
been introduced to a New England village, and made acquainted with most of the
leading villagers in a way which leaves the impression on him thenceforward that
he knows them personally, that their fortunes and failures, and achievements, and
misunderstandings are matters of interest to him, that he would like to know how
Gershom Vose got on with his farm, and if Joanna Gair's marriage turned out
happily, and if 'Say' Gair was as interesting as a farmer's wife as she has been
as a little child."



      
      
      
MARGARET AND HER BRIDESMAIDS.

By the Author of "The Queen of the County."

1 vol., 12mo. Elegant fancy cloth. Price $1.50.


This fascinating story of "Six School Girls" is as charming
a story as has been written for young ladies. The
talented author has a great reputation in England, and all
her books are widely circulated and read. "Faith Gartney's
Girlhood" and "Margaret and her Bridesmaids" should
stand side by side in every young lady's book-case. Read
what the London Athen       um, the highest literary authority,
says of it: "We may save ourselves the trouble of giving
any lengthened review of this book, for we recommend all
who are in search of a fascinating novel to read it for themselves.
They will find it well worth their while. There is a
freshness and originality about it quite charming, and there
is a certain nobleness in the treatment, both of sentiment
and incident, which is not often found. We imagine that
few can read it without deriving some comfort or profit from
the quiet good sense and unobtrusive words of counsel with
which it abounds."

The story is very interesting. It is the history of six
school-fellows. Margaret, the heroine, is, of course, a
woman in the highest state of perfection. But Lotty       the
little, wilful, wild, fascinating, brave Lotty       is the gem of
the book, and, as far as our experience in novel reading goes,
is an entirely original character       a creation       and a very
charming one. No story that occurs to our memory contains
more interest than this for novel readers, particularly those
of the tender sex, to whom it will be a dear favorite.

We hope the authoress will give us some more novels, as
good as "Margaret and her Bridesmaids."

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
