<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a town of Persia lived two brothers, sons of
a poor man; one named Cassim, the other Ali
Baba. Cassim, the elder, married a wife with a
considerable fortune, and lived at his ease; but the
wife of Ali Baba was as poor as himself: they
dwelt in a mean cottage in the suburbs, and he
maintained his family by cutting wood. Ali Baba
was in the forest preparing to load his asses with
the faggots he had cut, when he saw a troop of
horsemen approaching. He hastily climbed a large
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
thick tree, and hid himself among the branches.
Ali Baba counted forty of them; each took a loaded
portmanteau from his horse, and turning to the
rock, said, "Open, Sesame;" immediately a door
opened, the robbers passed in, when the door shut
of itself. In a short time the door opened again,
and the robbers came out, who said, "Shut, Sesame."
The door instantly closed. Ali Baba ventured
down, and approaching the rock, said, "Open,
Sesame." Immediately the door flew open. He
brought his asses, and took as many bags of gold
coin as they could carry.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ali Baba told his brother the secret of the cave.
Cassim rose early next morning, and set out with
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
ten mules loaded with great chests. He found the
rock, and having said, "Open Sesame," gained admission,
where he found more treasures than he expected,
which made him forget the word that caused
the door to open. Presently he heard the sound
of horses' feet, which he concluded to be the robbers,
who instantly put him to death. Ali Baba
drove to the forest, and on entering the cave, he
found the body of his brother cut into quarters.
He took the quarters, and put them upon one of
his asses, and delivered the body to Cassim's wife.
Morgiana, a female slave in his brother's house, was
sent early next morning to a poor cobbler, and gave
him two pieces of gold to go with her blindfolded;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
taking him into the room where the body was lying,
bade him sew the mangled limbs together. Mustapha
obeyed, having received two pieces of gold,
and was led blindfolded the same way back.</p>

</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cassim was buried with all due solemnity, and
Ali Baba removed to the house of his deceased
brother, of which he took possession.</p>

<p>The captain of the troop resolved to find out
who possessed the secret of entrance into his cave,
and disguising himself, went to the city early one
morning, when, accosting the cobbler, he was told
of the job he had, who for six pieces of gold, allowed
himself to be blindfolded, and traced out
the house of Cassim, which the robber marked
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
with chalk. Buying nineteen mules and thirty-nine
large jars, one full of oil, and the rest empty,
the captain put a man into each jar, properly armed,
and then proceeded to the street where Ali
Baba dwelt. "Sir," said he, "I have brought this
oil a great way to sell; as I am quite a stranger,
will you let me put my mules into your courtyard,
and direct me where I may lodge to-night?" Ali
Baba welcomed the pretended oil merchant, offered
him a bed in his own house, and invited his guest
in to supper.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
    <a name="p005-illus.jpg" id="p005-illus.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/p005-illus.jpg" width="350" height="300" alt="The cobbler is tricked" title="" />
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Morgiana, sitting up later that night than usual,
her lamp went out; she took her oil pot in her
hand, and approaching the first jar, the robber
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
within said: "Is it time, captain?" she replied, "No,
not yet;" so she ran back to the kitchen, and
brought out a large kettle, which she filled with
oil, set it on a great wood fire, and as soon as it boiled,
she went and poured into the jars sufficient of
the boiling oil to kill every man within.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
    <a name="p006-illus.jpg" id="p006-illus.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/p006-illus.jpg" width="350" height="301" alt="Hiding in the empty oil jars" title="" />
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The captain of the robbers arose to assemble his
men. Coming to the first jar, he felt the steam of
the boiled oil! He ran hastily to the rest, and
found every one of his troop put to death. Full
of rage, he forced the lock of the door, and made
his escape over the walls.</p>

<p>Without letting any one into the secret, Ali Baba
and Morgiana the next night buried the thirty-nine
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
thieves at the bottom of the garden. The captain at
length, however, determined to adopt a new scheme
for the destruction of Ali Baba. He removed all
the valuable merchandise from the cave to the city,
and took a shop exactly opposite to Ali Baba's
house. Ali Baba's son went every day to his shop.
The pretended Cogia Hassan soon appeared to be
very fond of Ali Baba's son, offered him many presents,
and often detained him to dinner.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">

    <img src="images/p007-illus.jpg" width="350" height="295" alt="Enraged" title="" />
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ali Baba thought it was necessary to make some
return to these civilities, and he invited Cogia Hassan
to supper; Morgiana carried in the first dish
herself. The moment she looked at Cogia Hassan,
she knew it was the pretended oil merchant. She
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
sent the other slaves into the kitchen, and waited
at table herself; and while Cogia Hassan was
drinking, she perceived he had a dagger hid under
his coat. She went away, and dressed herself in
the habit of a dancing-girl. As soon as she appeared
at the parlor door, her master ordered her
to come in to entertain his guest with some of her
best dancing. Morgiana danced several times before
the assembled company, until, coming opposite
Cogia Hassan, she drew a dagger from her girdle
and plunged it into the robber's heart. As a reward
for her faithfulness, Ali Baba gave her in
marriage to his son, and at his death put them in
possession of his immense wealth.</p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
