CHAPTER IThe New Instructor


1


Tex Yancey, called        The Flying Fool        by his comrades in the
       th Pursuit Squadron of the American Expeditionary Force, entered the mess
hall with lips pressed into a thin, mirthless grin that seemed entirely
inappropriate in one who was thirty minutes late to mess and must therefore make
out with what was left. The other members of the squadron had finished their
meal and were now engaged in the usual after-dinner practice of spinning some
tall yarns.

Yancey stalked slowly to his place at the long table, but instead of seating
himself stood with hands thrust deep into his pockets and with his long, thin
legs spread wide apart. For a full minute he stood there, seeming to be mildly
interested in the tale that Hank Porter was telling. But those who knew Tex, as
did the members of this squadron, knew that the cynical smile on his thin lips
was but the forerunner <a
id='page_14'>14of some mirthless thing from which only        The
Flying Fool        would be able to wring a laugh. His was such a grotesque
sense of humor; a highly impractical practical joke was his idea of a riotous
time. Someone in the squadron, who had once felt the sting of one of his pranks,
had called him a fool, and another member had responded,        Yeah, he       s
a fool, all right       but a flyin        fool!        The tribute had become a
nickname, and Yancey rather reveled in it.

Just now his smile was masking some grim joke and his eyes held the mild
light of pity.

       Well, Hank,        he drawled at last, when Porter had wound up his
story,        that yarn, as much as I get of it, would lead the average
hombre to pick you out as a sho               nuff flyer. I would myself. Me,
I       m easy fooled that way. I reckon all you buckaroos think you know
somethin        about flyin       , eh?       

Standing a full six feet two, he looked down upon them, the look of pity
still in his eyes in strange conflict with the mirthless smile still on his
lips.

       What       s eatin        you?        Porter growled.        We
can       t help it because you       re late for mess. Where       ve you
been?       

Siddons and Hampden, not greatly interested in what they felt was some new
strained humor on Yancey       s part, pushed back from the table and started
for the door, their objective being the French town of Is Sur Tille.

15Yancey waited
until they were near the door before he answered Porter.

       Oh, I       ve just been over to Is Sur Tille havin        a look-see
at this new instructor that       s comin        down here to teach us how to
fly.       

Siddons, with his hand upon the door, wheeled abruptly and studied
Yancey       s face, trying to discover the jest hidden behind that baffling,
masking smile.

       Are you joking us?        he demanded from the doorway, but
sufficiently convinced to turn back.

The        Flying Fool        smiled sweetly.        Why, Siddons, I
wouldn       t kid you-all about that sort o        thing,        he drawled.
       I saw him myself, in town, ridin        in a car with the C.O.

[A] Like
as not the Major will bring him in here this evenin        for a little
chin-chin.       

A suppressed growl arose from the other pilots.

       What is he coming here for?        young Edouard Fouche demanded,
knowing the answer but anxious to have it brought out in the open where it could
be attacked and vilified by all.

Yancey seated himself, tilted his chair back from the table and bestowed
another sweet smile upon a room filled with scowling faces. It was a delicious
moment       for Tex.

       Why, he       s comin        here to teach you poor worms
16how to fly. It seems
that someone back in the States made a mistake in thinkin        we were pilots.
We       re here by accident. Ha! Ha! That       s what we are       just
accidents. Did you boys think we were sent over here to get all messed up in
this little old war? Tut, tut! We       re here just to add grandeur to the
colorless scenery. Now be nice to this fellow when he comes. Maybe after he has
labored with us for a while we       ll be turned into ferry pilots and be sent
to ferryin        planes up to the regular guys. I       m so glad I horned in
on this scrap; it       s so well planned and       and
thrillin       .       

More growls. Tex wasn       t being at all funny. Indeed, if this ridiculous
story were true, then it was the last straw on the camel       s back. Had they
not already suffered enough?

The squadron had been in France for two weeks, an interminable time to the
restless group of young airmen who, booted and belted and ready for the fray,
now found themselves suddenly faced with the prospect of still more training and
when as yet they had not the haziest notion of the type of ship that was to be
given them for mounts. One rumor had it that they were to get American ships
powered by a much-talked-of mystery motor. Very well, but where were those
ships? Another rumor, equally persistent, was to the effect that they were to
draw French Spads. Very well again, but where were the Spads? <span
class='pagenum pncolor'>17Still other rumors included
Camels, Sopwiths, Nieuports and Pups. One rumor, uglier and more maddening than
all the others, was to the effect that the entire squadron was to be used in
observation work. Fancy that! A pursuit pilot being given a slow-moving
observation crate with a one-winged, half-baked observer giving orders from the
rear cockpit! It was enough to make a man wish he had joined the Marines. What
was the good of all their combat training if they were to poke around over the
front in busses that were meat for any enemy plane that chanced to sight them?
It was enough to make a sane squadron go crazy, and the        th Pursuit
Squadron was known throughout the service as the wildest bunch of thrill chasers
ever collected and turned over to a distressed and despairing squadron
commander.

Some swivel-chair expert must have been dozing when the order went through
sending them to France. In wash-out records they were the grand champions. They
had left behind them a long train of cracked props, broken wings, stripped
landing gears       and a few wrecks so complete that the drivers thereof had
been sent home in six foot boxes draped with flags. But whatever may be said
against them, one thing was certain in their minds and in the minds of all who
knew them: They could fly! To them, any old crate that could be influenced to
leave the ground was <a
id='page_18'>18a ship, and they were willing to take it up at any
time, at any place, and regardless of air conditions. Perhaps their record had
been less black had they been given better ships.

A student, seeking a perfect cross-section of American youth, would have
found this squadron an interesting specimen. War drums, beating throughout the
land, had summoned them from the four points of the compass. How they had ever
been assembled at one field is a problem known only to the white-collared
dignitaries who sat in swivel chairs and shuffled their service cards. The
result of the shuffle caused many a commander to tear his hair and declare that
the cards had been stacked against him.

No two members of the squadron came from the same town or city; no two of
them had the same outlook on life; no two members thoroughly understood one
another. A Texan, such as Yancey, from the wind-swept Panhandle, may bunk with a
world-travelled, well educated linguist, such as Siddons, and may even learn to
call him Wart, but he never thoroughly understands him. A tide-water Virginian,
such as Randolph Hampden, of the bluest of blue blood, may sit at mess by the
side of a Californian, such as Hank Porter, but he will show no real interest in
California climate and will never be able to make the westerner understand that
Virginia is American history and not just a state. A nasal-voiced Vermonter,
19such as Nathan Rodd,
brought up among stern hills and by sterner parents, will never fully understand
a soft-voiced Louisianian, such as Edouard Fouche, who has found the world a
very pleasant place with but few restrictions.

Leaving out the question of patriotism, the members had but three common
attributes: They had scornful disregard for any officer in the air service who
knew less of flying than they had learned through the medium of hard knocks;
they were determined from the very beginning to get to France; and they were the
most care-free, reckless, adventurous, devil-may-care bunch of stem-winders that
had ever plagued and embarrassed the service by the simple procedure of being
gathered into one group.

It may be that the War Department, in despair, at last thought to be rid of
them by sending them overseas where their ability and proclivity for stirring up
trouble could be turned to good account against the enemy. In any case, they
were at last in France and from the moment of their landing had been exceedingly
voluble in their demands for planes. They wanted action, not delay. And now that
Yancey had brought word of this last crushing indignity, they opened wide the
spigots of wrath, all talked at once, and the sum total of their comments
contained no single word that could be considered as complimentary to management
of the war. More instruction in <a
id='page_20'>20flying! It was unthinkable. But then, perhaps this
grim joker, Yancey, was spoofing a bit.

       Come on, Wart,        Hampden called to Siddons from the doorway.
       Tex has just been listening to old General Rumor. I       d like right
much to see this instructor before I get excited about it. Come on, let       s
go into town. The night       s young       and so am I.       

       You       ll get excited when you see him,        Tex responded,
sagely.

       Who is he?        Nathan Rodd asked, which was about as long a
sentence as Rodd ever spoke. He saved words as though they were so much
gold.

       He       s an English lieutenant,        Tex answered.
       Red-headed, freckle-faced, and so runty that he       d have to set on a
stepladder to see out of a cockpit.       

       A Limey!        chorused half a dozen incredulous, angry voices.
       Whatdya know about that!       

Tex nodded solemnly. He was enjoying the situation. Inwardly, he was as
furious as any of the others, but he had the happy faculty of being able to
enjoy mob distress.        Yeah, a Limey! Some gink in town told me he was a
famous ace. I forget his name. Never could remember names. But you boys       ll
love him. Like as not he       ll let some of us solo after a month or so.
Ain       t the air service wonderful?       

More growls, and a half dozen muttered threats.

21       Now boys,
you-all be good, or Uncle Samuel       ll send you back home and let you work in
the shipyards at twenty per day. I       m surprised and hurt that you take this
good news in this fashion. I should think you       d be delighted to have a
Limey show you how he shot down a few of              

       Attention!        Hampden called from the doorway, a warning quality
in his voice.

The men looked up. There in the doorway stood Major Cowan, and by his side
was a neatly uniformed, diminutive member of the Royal Flying Corps. The men
scrambled hastily to their feet. Yancey upset his chair with a clatter as he
unwound his long, thin legs from around the rungs.

Major Cowan, always maddeningly correct in military courtesies, turned upon
Hampden with a withering look.

       Lieutenant,        his voice had the edge of a razor but its cut was
not so smooth,        do you not know that attention is not called when at
mess?       

       Yes, sir.       

       You do, or you do not?       

       Double negatives bother me right much,        Hampden replied, his
eyes on the English pilot and caring not a whit for court-martial now that he
saw in the flesh the proof of Yancey       s report,        but I do know the
rule.       

       Then observe it,        Major Cowan responded, testily. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'>22       Gentlemen, this is
Lieutenant McGee, of the British Royal Flying Corps, who has been assigned to us
as flying instructor.       

Lieutenant McGee felt that the room was surcharged with hostility, and he
found himself in the position of one who is ashamed of the acts of another.
Major Cowan, altogether too brusque, failed utterly to impress McGee, whose
service in the Royal Flying Corps had been with a class of men who thought more
of deeds than of rank and who could enjoy a care-free camaraderie without
becoming careless of discipline. Discipline, after all, is never deeper than
love and respect, and McGee felt somehow that Cowan was not a man to command
either. McGee felt his face coloring, and tried to dispel it with a smile.

       I am glad to meet you, gentlemen,        he said,        and I want to
correct the Major       s statement. I am not here as a flying instructor, in
the strict sense of the word, but to give you, first hand, some of our
experiences in formation flying, combat, and patrol work. I dare say you are all
well trained. In fact, I have heard some rather flattering reports concerning
you.       

Yancey cast a sidelong glance at his neighbor; Siddons nudged Hank Porter.
Porter pressed his foot against Fouche       s boot. Not a bad fellow, this.
Something like, eh?

Major Cowan was not one who could permit others <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>23to roll the sweets of flattery under their
tongues. He must qualify it with a touch of vinegar.

       Lieutenant McGee is modest concerning his duties,        he said.
       In fact, you will find all English officers becomingly modest.       

       But I am not English!        McGee corrected.        I am an
American       born in America, and that       s why I have been so happy about
this assignment.       

Several members of the squadron began edging nearer. Perhaps things were not
going to be so dreadful after all.

       Indeed?        Major Cowan lifted his eyebrows in surprise. The points
of his nicely trimmed moustache twitched nervously as he began to wonder just
how he should treat an American who happened to be wearing the uniform and
insignia of a lieutenant in the R.F.C.

       My parents were English,        McGee decided to explain,        but I
was born in the States. When the war broke out, my brother, who was older by a
few years, came over and joined the balloon corps. I was too young to enlist,
but my parents were both dead and I came along with my brother, remaining in
London until               he hesitated and cleared his voice of a sudden
huskiness,        until word came that my brother had been killed. His balloon
was shot down while he was up spotting artillery fire. Naturally, I began to try
to get in. I had to put over a fast one on the examining <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>24board, but I made it. And here I am at
last, with my own countrymen. Top hole, isn       t it?        His smile was so
genuine and compelling that none could doubt the sincerity of his pleasure. All
barriers of restraint were broken down. This chap actually courted
conversation.

       Why don       t you get repatriated, Lieutenant?        Yancey
asked.

       The tactless fool!        Hampden thought, but dared not say. Of
course the Texas clown would rush in where angels feared to tread. Didn       t
the fathead have any conception of pride of uniform and pride in a
nation       s accomplishments? Hampden felt that he would like to hit Yancey
with one of the water carafes.

       What       s that? Repatriated?        McGee repeated.        How can
that be done?       

       Haven       t you seen the General Order providing for it?        Tex
continued, despite Major Cowan       s silencing frown.

       I       m afraid not,        McGee replied.        I       ve been
pretty busy       and I don       t get a great thrill out of G.O.       s. Tell
me about it.       

       Well               Yancey began slowly, enjoying to the fullest the
opportunity to provide information uninterrupted,        as you know, a lot of
Americans joined the English and French air forces before we came in. Some of
       em, just like you, maybe, had a sort of <a
id='page_25'>25score to settle. But I reckon most of        em went
in because it offered something unusual and a lot of thrills. Huh! You tell        em!
Then when Uncle Sam got warm under the saddle and came hornin        in, a lot
of the boys who       d come over and joined up began castin        homesick
glances back in a westerly direction. Natural-like, Uncle Samuel is
willin        to welcome home all his prodigal sons, if he can get        em
back, and he       s specially forgivin        considerin        that his army
at the beginnin        of hostilities is just about one day       s bait on a
real war-like front. As for flyers, he hasn       t got enough of        em,
trained, to do observation work for an energetic battery of heavies. So he makes
medicine talk with Johnny Bull and with France, and for once he comes out with
all the buttons on his trousers. They agree to release all the Americans
servin        under their colors who express a desire to get into O.D. under the
Stars and Stripes.        Repatriation        was the flossy name they gave it, but I
call it homesickness. A lot of the wayward sons jumped at it quick, and
we       re        way ahead on the game, any way you look at it. Now take some of
those boys in the Lafayette Escadrille. Why, if they              

Yancey       s voice droned on, but McGee no longer heard what he was saying,
though to all appearances he was paying courteous attention. But as a matter of
fact his eyes were resting upon Lieutenant Siddons, and he was cudgelling his
brain in an effort to <a
id='page_26'>26remember where he had seen him before. The blond,
curly hair; the rather square face and brow; the thin lips, the calm, cold grey
eyes; and the air of self-satisfied assurance, all were part of a memory which
was vivid enough but which refused to come out of the back of the mind and
associate itself with identifying surroundings. Where had he seen that face? New
York? No, not there. He knew very few people in New York. Well, after all,
perhaps it was only a strong resemblance. But resembling whom? Surely no one of
his acquaintances looked like Siddons, at least none that he could remember.

McGee       s gaze must have been a little too steady, at least enough to
prove discomfiting, for Siddons half turned away and began speaking in whispers
to Hampden. He talked out of the corner of his mouth, as one who is ashamed of
the words he utters, and McGee felt the stirrings of a faint dislike for
him.

Yancey reached the end of his monologue. The moment of silence that followed
brought McGee sharply back to the present. He smiled graciously at the
Texan.

       That       s quite interesting,        he said.        Strange I
missed that order, and stranger still that no one mentioned it to me. But
we       ve been pretty busy up in the Ypres salient       too busy to think
much about what flag we were fighting under. I       ve enjoyed being with the
English, but of course        there       s no place like <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>27home       . I       m very happy to be
assigned here, and I am glad Major Cowan gave me this chance to meet you. The
Major tells me that you are to get several new Spads in the next two or three
days. Until that time, I won       t disturb you. I       m driving back into
town. Anyone want a lift?       

       Thank you, Lieutenant,        Hampden spoke up,        Siddons and I
are going in. Have you room?       

       Certainly. Glad to have you along. Major Cowan, how about
you?       

       Sorry,        the Major replied, dourly,        but I have to pay the
price of command by poring over a lot of detail work which would be spared me if
I had a more efficient staff.       

Mullins, the peppery little Operations Officer, felt the full force of the
sting but he passed it off by winking wisely at Yancey. Why worry? Cowan was
always looking for work and for trouble. He was never so happy as when bawling
someone out.

McGee felt sorry for Mullins and sorrier still for Cowan. One with half an
eye could see that Cowan was about as popular with his command as would be a
case of smallpox. McGee had been trained in an atmosphere where discipline was a
matter of example rather than a matter of fear, and as a result had always known
a sort of good-fellowship which he felt instinctively would be impossible with
such a commander as Cowan.

28       I       m
sorry you can       t come with us, Major,        McGee said in a voice that
carried no conviction.        However, I must toddle along.        He turned to
Siddons and Hampden.        Ready? Right-O!       

During the short motor trip into Is Sur Tille, McGee       s curiosity
finally got the better of his natural dislike for admitting that his memory had
failed him.        I think I have met you somewhere before, Lieutenant,       
he said to Siddons.

       Yes? I do not remember it,        Siddons replied, with the air of one
who is making no great draft upon his own memory. He himself evidently sensed
the lack of courtesy, for he added,        New York, perhaps. Have you been
around New York much?       

       No, I haven       t. Somewhere else              

Lieutenant Hampden       s mellow laugh interrupted.

       Siddons has the idea that one never meets anyone outside of New
York,        he said.        He       s terribly provincial, Lieutenant. He
thinks there are only two places in the world       New York and everywhere
else.       

Siddons displayed no resentment at the taunt; he seemed quite well satisfied
with the opinion expressed. In fact, he appeared quite satisfied with
everything       especially with himself.

McGee wondered how a likeable chap, such as Hampden, could choose as
companion one so utterly different in manner, in ideas, and in speech. But <span
class='pagenum pncolor'>29then, war brings together
strange bedfellows and establishes new standards. McGee dismissed the matter
from his mind as the car swung into the narrow streets of the darkened town.

       Where can I drop you?        he asked.

       Going by the café down on the main drag?        Hampden asked.

       Right.       

       That will be fine. I hope to see you again soon,
Lieutenant.       

       Thanks. The Spads are due to arrive on Monday. That       s three
days. See you then. Well, here we are,        as the car swung in to the curb in
front of the café. The shutters were closed, no light came from any of the
stores or houses along the street, but from behind the closed door of the café
came the sound of voices and laughter mixed with the metallic banging of a very
old piano beating out tuneless accompaniment to a bull-voiced singer roaring
through the many verses of        Hinkey Dinkey Parlez Vous       .


       The Yank Marine went over the top,            Parlez
Vous, The Yank Marine went over the top,
            Parlez Vous, The Yank Marine went over the
top And gave old Fritz a whale of a pop,             Hinkey
Dinkey, Parlez Vous.        

McGee smiled as he sat for a moment listening to <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>30the words. All his service had been with
the English, who of course had composed many songs highly complimentary to
themselves, and only in the last few days had he come in contact with the
forerunners of the mighty American army now pouring into French harbors from
every arriving boat.

       Quite a fellow       this Yank Marine,        he said to Siddons.

Siddons nodded, rather stiffly.        So it seems. Though he hasn       t
been over the top yet. Prophecy, I suppose.        He stepped from the car to
the curb with the bearing of one accustomed to being delivered in a
chauffeur-driven car.

McGee was on the point of calling out,        When shall I call, sir?       
but at that moment noticed young Hampden       s genuine smile and heard him
voicing words of appreciation for the lift.

       Don       t mention it,        McGee said.        It was a pleasure.
Cheerio! old man!       

       There,        he thought, sinking back in the tonneau.        I said
       old man       . Singular case, and that lets Siddons out rather neatly. Hum.
I       ll bet a cookie he knows more about flying than I do       or anyone
else, for that matter. Well, we       ll see. I wonder what sort of outfit Buzz
drew.       

Lieutenant        Buzz        Larkin was closer to McGee than any person in
the world. Close bonds of friendship had been formed while they were in training
in 31Cadet Brigade
Headquarters, at Hastings, England. During their months of service together in
the Royal Air Force, on exceedingly hot fronts, those bonds of friendship had
become bands of steel, holding them together almost as firmly as blood ties.
Both were Americans, but the motives back of their entrance into the R.F.C. were
as widely divergent as possible. Larkin, the son of a wealthy manufacturer, had
never disclosed the real reason for his entrance into a foreign service. Perhaps
he sought adventure. McGee, however, made no secret of the motives back of his
entrance. When word reached him that his brother had been killed while doing
observation work in a captive balloon, young McGee, not yet eighteen, employed a
trick (which he thought justified) to gain entrance to the Air Force. He felt
that he must carry on an unfinished work, and few will find fault with him if
his actions were motivated by a slight spirit of revenge. After all, blood is
thicker than water.

Whatever the motives of the two youths, once in the uniform of cadet flyers,
the spirit of service seized them. Side by side, encouraging, entreating,
helping and driving one another they plugged through their training with their
eyes fixed upon the coveted reward of every air service cadet       a pair of
silvered wings!

Together they had won their wings; together they <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>32had gone to the front; together they had
gone out on patrol, high above the lines, and met the enemy. Thereafter, the
fortune of one was the fortune of both. Each had saved the other       s life,
the culminating tie in their friendship, if indeed their friendship needed any
further tie.

Both had become aces, though in combat work McGee was easily the superior.
This, however, he constantly denied and was forever admiring Larkin       s
work. Larkin, if inferior to McGee in a dog fight, was better disciplined. He
could go up in formation, keep his eye on his flight commander, obey orders, and
keep his head when he saw an enemy plane. McGee, on the contrary, went as wild
as a berserker the moment he laid eyes on a plane bearing the black cross.
Orders were forgotten and he dived, throttle wide open, stick far forward, every
thought gone from his mind but the one compelling urge to get that other plane
on the inside of his ring sight. McGee had his personal faults, but he was a
faultless flyer. The same may be said of Larkin, for men in aerial combat never
make but one vital mistake. Those who become aces have no great faults; those
with great faults become mere tallies for the aces. Now and then, of course, the
grim scorer nods during the game and a fault goes unpenalized, but as a rule it
can be said that a man who can become an ace may well be called a faultless
flyer, for an ace is one <a
id='page_33'>33who has rolled up a score of five victories against
those whose skill was less than his own. Of course, there is the element of luck
to be considered, for luck and skill must go hand in hand when youths go
jousting in the clouds. But luck can only attend the skillful. With skill
wanting, luck soon deserts.

Beyond doubt both McGee and Larkin had enjoyed a full measure of luck, and
were still enjoying it. For example, wasn       t it luck that had sent them
both down here on the French front to act as instructors to newly arriving
American squadrons? Wasn       t it luck that they were still billeted together
in the lovely old chateau at the edge of town, and could look forward to many,
many more days together?

These latter thoughts were running through McGee       s mind as his car
swung under the trees lining the drive that led up to the chateau. Why, but for
luck both of them might now be pushing up the daisies instead of being happily,
and comparatively safely ensconced in such comfortable quarters. No more dawn
patrols       for a while at least; no more soggy breakfasts       with comrades
missing who banteringly breakfasted with you twenty-four short hours ago.

McGee       s thoughts took unconscious vocal form as he stepped from the
car.        Lucky? I       ll say we are!       

       What did you say, sir?        asked the driver.

The question snapped McGee back to earth.

       I was complimenting myself upon some very narrow <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>34escapes, Martins, but I       ll
repeat       for your benefit. You are a very lucky boy.       

Martins blinked. He held opposite views.        You think so, sir? I       ve
gotta different idea. I wanted to be a pilot, like you, sir, and here I am
toolin        this old bus around France with never a chance to get off the
ground unless I run off an embankment. And this old wreck is no bird.       

       So you really wanted to be a pilot, Martins?       

       I sure did, sir.       

       Um-m. That       s why I said you were a very lucky young man. I know
the names of a lot of young fellows who wanted to become pilots       and did.
But they       ve gone West now and their names are on wooden crosses. Hoe your
own row, Martins, and thank the Lord for small favors.       

       Yes, sir,        aloud, and under his breath,        It       s easy
enough for them that has wings.       

       How       s that, Martins?        McGee asked, rather enjoying
himself.

Martins fidgeted with the gear shift.        I said I had always wanted a
pair of wings, sir.       

       Well, be a good boy and maybe you       ll get them       in the next
world. Good night, Martins.       

              Night       sir.        Gurrr! went the clashing gears as the car got
under way with a lurch that spoke volumes for the driver. It was tough to be
held to the ground by a wingless motor.

35McGee caught a
gleam of light through the shutters of the upstairs windows. So Larkin was back
already? He took the front steps in a jump and raced up the stairs in a manner
most unbecoming to a First Lieutenant with a score of victories to his
credit.

       What kind of an outfit did you draw, Buzz?        he demanded as he
burst into the room.

Larkin was buried behind a Paris edition of the Tribune, his legs
sprawled out into the middle of the floor where the heel of one boot balanced
precariously on the toe of the other.

       Oh, so-so,        never bothering to look from behind his paper.
Phlegmatic old Buzz, McGee thought, what was the use of getting excited over an
instructor       s job?

       Are they good?        McGee asked.

       Um. Dunno.        Still reading.

       Mine are great!        McGee enthused.        Stiff, crusty young
C.O., who needs a couple of crashes       one fatal, maybe       but the rest of
them are fine. Great bunch of pilots.       

       Yeah?        Still reading, but doubtful.        See any of        em
fly?       

       No-o,        slowly,        of course not.       

       Um-m. Well, wait until they begin sticking the noses of those new
Spads in the ground, and then tell me about        em. They       ve been
trained on settin        hens. Wait until they mount a hawk.       

36McGee jerked a
pillow from the bed and sent it crashing through the concealing paper.
       Old killjoy! If a man gave you a diamond you       d try it on glass to
see if it was real.       

Larkin began rearranging his crumpled paper.        Well, why not? If it
wasn       t real I wouldn       t want it. And I wish you       d keep your
pillows out of my theatrical news. I was just reading about a play at the
Folies Bergeres, called        Zig Zag       . They say it       s a scream. By
the way, Shrimp, how       d you like to fly to Paris to-morrow morning and give
it the once over?       

       Fine, but              

       But nothing! We can see it to-morrow night and be back the next day.
That fine bunch of pilots of yours can       t get off the ground until the
Spads get here       and maybe not then.       

       See here!        McGee challenged stoutly.        I       ll bet you
anything you like that those boys              

       Will all be aces in a month,        Larkin completed, knowing the
extent and warmth of McGee       s habitual enthusiasm.        All right,
Shrimp, so be it. But what has that to do with the show? Want to go?       

       Sure. But what about passes? I don       t know just who we are
answerable to down here, in the matter of privileges and so forth. I       ve
been sort of lost for the last few days.       

Larkin shoved his hand into his inside blouse <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>37pocket and brought forth two folded papers
which he displayed proudly.

       Here are the passes       all jake! Marked official business and
authorizing fuel and supplies, if needed. I       m a great little fixer. And
about that question of not knowing who you are answerable to, don       t forget
that it       s little Johnny Bull       capital J and B. You       re liable to
get jerked off this detail so quick you       ll leave toothbrush and pajamas
behind. Every morning now when I wake up and remember that I don       t have to
go out on dawn patrol I start pinching myself to see if I       m awake. Boy, in
this game it       s here to-day and gone to-morrow. Wasn       t it old Omar
who handed out that gag,        Ah, make the most of what we yet may spend, before we
too into the dust descend       ?... Yeah? Well, he must have written that for
war pilots. The minute J.B. finds out how comfortable we are down here
we       ll be recalled and sent to chasing Huns back across the line. In fact,
I think we       re both asleep and having nice dreams.       

       That reminds me,        McGee said, drawing up a chair and sitting
gingerly on the edge after the manner of one about to indulge in confidential
disclosures.        Have you heard anything of this repatriation
business?       

       Sure. Haven       t you?       

       Not a word.       

       Where have you been? It came down in a G.O.       

38McGee scratched
his head.        So I       ve just learned, but it       s the first I       ve
heard of it. Funny you didn       t mention it to me.       

Larkin eyed him curiously.        Well,        slowly,        I knew you were
English and              

       But I       m not, and you know it!        McGee flared.

       Calm, brother, calm! I mean, I knew your father and mother were
English, and so was your brother.       

       But I was born in America. I       m just as much of an American as
you are!       

       Calm, brother, calm! No one says you are not. But because of your
family nationality, I supposed you would want to finish out the string with the
R.F.C. and,        he reached over and tousled McGee       s mop of flaming red
hair,        I       m just fool enough to want to stick around where you
are       you little shrimp! So I thought I wouldn       t bring up the
subject.       

McGee gave him a look of deep understanding and appreciation.

       Fact is,        Larkin went on,        I just got a letter from Dad
the other day and he seems to be pretty hot under the collar because I
haven       t made any move to get repatriated.       

       Why haven       t you?       

       You poor nut! I       ve just told you.       

       No you haven       t, Buzz. There is some reason deeper than
that.       

39Larkin fingered
his newspaper nervously and tried to simulate an interest in some news note. He
hated to display sentiment, yet the fates had given him a double burden of it.
As a matter of honest fact, he was as sentimental as a woman, and was forever
trying to hide the fact behind a thin veneer of nonchalance and bluster.

       Did you see this communique from our old front?        he asked,
trying to shift the subject.        They       re having some hot fighting up
there.       

       Yes, I know. Things look pretty dark for the English. But answer my
question: What is the real reason why you haven       t thought of getting
transferred into the United States forces?       

       I didn       t say I hadn       t thought of it,        Larkin
avoided.        Maybe I didn       t want to trade horses in the middle of the
stream.       

       Any other reason?       

       Well, hang it all! a fellow builds up some pride in the uniform he
wears. A good many of our buddies have gone out for their last ride in this
uniform and       and it stands for a lot. Of course I am proud of my own
country, and sometimes I feel a little strange in this uniform now that my own
country is in the war, but it isn       t a thing you can put on or take off
just as the spirit moves you. It becomes a part of you. Say! What       s
eatin        you, anyway? Are you anxious to change uniforms?       

40       Um-m.
I       m not so sure. I like that bunch I met over there to-night.       

       Yes, and they are all afoot. The truth is, our own country
hasn       t enough combat planes to send out a patrol. They are developing some
mystery motor, I hear, but I       m not very keen about trying out any mystery
motors. Our Camels are mystery enough to suit me. When I       m up against the
ceiling with a fast flying Albatross or tri-plane Fokker on my tail, I
don       t want any mysteries to handle. No, Red, for the time being I guess
I       m satisfied. Besides, they might chuck me in the infantry, and I have a
horror of having things drop on me from overhead. Let       s to bed, old
topper, so we can hop off early in the morning. The sooner we start the sooner
we get to        Gay Paree       . Besides, early to bed and early to rise makes a man
ready to challenge the skies. How       s that for impromptu poetry?       

       Rotten! Omar and Ben Franklin both in one evening!        McGee yawned
as he began pulling at a boot.        But it makes me sleepy. Go on, say me some
more pretty pieces. Or maybe you       d like to sing me to sleep.

41CHAPTER IIA Pass to Paris


1


The following morning dawned with the quiet splendor and benediction which
April mornings bring to the rural province of Cote d       Or. By the time the sun had
climbed above the low hills to the east and was turning the dew covered fields
into limitless acres of flashing diamonds and sapphires, McGee and Larkin had
hurried through breakfast and were on their way out to the hangars where the
mechanics, following Larkin       s orders, would have the two Camels waiting on
the line. As the car rolled along the smooth highway leading to the flying
field, McGee sank back in the none too comfortable cushions and drank deep of
the tonic of early morning.

       Some day!        he said. Larkin merely nodded       the only reply
needed when Spring is in the air.

       It would be more fun to drive up to Paris,        McGee offered.

Larkin looked at him in surprise.        Where       d you get that
idea?       

       Well, nearly all of my impressions of France are <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>42from the air. It stands for so many
squares of green fields, of little rivers gleaming like silver ribbons
interlaced through squares of green and brown plush, of torn up battlefronts
where there is no life, no color       nothing but desolation. But this seems
like another world. Here are spring flowers, the orchards are in bloom, and
children are playing in the narrow streets of the towns. Flying over it, you
look down on all that. You see it       and you don       t see it. But in
driving we would feel that we were a part of it. There       s a difference. It
gives you a feeling that you are better acquainted with the people, and you get
a chance to smell something besides the beastly old Clerget motors in those
Camels. I       m getting so I feel sick every time I smell burning oil.
Let       s drive up, Buzz.       

Larkin, being in a different frame of mind, shook his head.

       No, you       re too blasted poetic about it already. Besides, we have
permission to fly up, not to drive. I suppose we could get the pass changed, but
why fool with your luck? And the quicker we get there the more we
see.       

       All right, but on a day like this I could get more pleasure out of
just wandering through the countryside than in seeing all the cities of the
world rolled into one. Look!        he pointed to the flying field as the car
turned from the highway.        There are the Camels, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>43warming up, and filling this good, clean
air with their sickening fumes. Bah! I hate it!       

       Say, have you got the pip? You talk like a farmer. Snap out of it!
We       re headed for Gay Paree!       

The car had rolled to a stop at the edge of the field. McGee climbed out
slowly.        All right, big boy. You lead the way. And no contour chasing
to-day. I       m too liable to get absent-minded and try to reach out and pick
some daisies. Besides, this motor of mine has been trickier than usual in the
last few days despite the fact that the Ack Emma declares she is top hole. So
fly high and handsome. Know the way?       

Larkin was crawling into his flying suit and did not answer.

       Know the way?        McGee repeated.

       Sure. That       s a fine question to ask a pilot bound for Paris. We
land at Le Bourget field, you know.       

       No, I didn       t know.       

       Where       d you think you       d land       in the Champs
Elysees?       

       I       m liable to land on a church steeple if that motor cuts out on
me as it did yesterday afternoon       for no reason at all. Remember, no
contour chasing and no dog-fighting. We       re going to Paris.       

Larkin grinned. Rarely did they go into the air together but what they
engaged in mimic warfare       dog-fighting       before their wheels again
touched the ground. It was the airman       s game of tag, the winner <span
class='pagenum pncolor'>44being that one who could
get on the other       s tail and stay there. It was a thunderous, strut singing
game wherein the pursued threw his plane into fantastic gyrations in a frenzied,
wild effort to shake off the pursuer and get on his tail. It was a game in which
McGee excelled. Although Larkin recognized this fact, he was always the first to
start the dog fight and had never found McGee unwilling to play. As for contour
chasing       well, they had broken regulations times without number, and to
date had paid no penalty.

McGee, knowing what thoughts lurked behind Larkin       s grin, wagged a
prudent finger under his nose.

       Mind your step, Buzz,        he warned.        We are supposed to be
sedate, dignified, instruction-keeping instructors. Fly northwest to Auxerre,
then follow the railroad toward Sens and on to Melun. Then swing straight north
and come into Le Bourget from the east.       

       All right. All set?       

       Yes. You lead off and I       ll follow. Wait! On second thought I
think I       ll lead and pick my own altitude. And if you start any funny
business, I       ll leave you flat!       

They climbed into the waiting planes, whose motors were still warming idly.
Members of the ground crew took up their stations at the wing tips. McGee was on
the point of nodding to the crew to remove <a
id='page_45'>45the wheel chocks when he remembered that for the first
time in his experience as a pilot he had climbed into the cockpit without first
casting an appraising eye over braces, struts and turn buckles. He promptly cut
the motor and climbed from the plane, saying, half aloud;        I must be
getting balmy. It       s the weather, I guess.       

       How       s that, sir?        asked the air mechanic.

       I say, it       s balmy weather we       re having.       

       Oh! Yes, sir.       

       You       ve checked her all over, Wilson?       

       Yes, sir. And fueled her according to Lieutenant Larkin       s
instructions.       

       Hum.        McGee slowly walked around the plane, giving every
functional detail a critical look, nor was he the least hurried by the fact that
Larkin was displaying impatience. Satisfied at last, he climbed back into the
plane. A member of the ground crew took his place at the propeller.

       Petrol off, sir?       

       Petrol off.       

Whish! Whish! went the prop as the helper began pulling it over against
compression.

       Contact, sir!       

       Contact.       

The motor caught, coughed, caught again and the prop whirled into an
indistinct blur. The sudden blast of wind sent clouds of dust eddying toward the
46hangar, but ahead lay
the cool, fresh, dew-washed green of the field. McGee turned to look once more
at the wind sock which, for want of a breeze, hung limp along its staff. He
nodded to the men at the wheel chocks, waved his hand to Larkin and gave her the
gun.

No pilot in the service could lift a Camel off the ground quicker than could
McGee, but this morning he taxied slowly forward and was getting dangerously
near the end of the field before he began to get the tail up.

Larkin, watching him, chuckled.        Guess he wants to take a spin on the
ground,        he commented to himself.        Fancy that bird wanting to go to
Paris by motor!        Then to show how little he thought of the ground he
advanced his throttle rapidly and took off on far less space than should ever be
attempted by one who knows, from experience, how suddenly a crowded
Clerget-motored Camel can sputter and incontinently die. And as a parting
defiance to his knowledge, Larkin pulled back his stick and zoomed. Altitude was
what McGee wanted, eh? Well, here was the way to get altitude in a hurry.

McGee, glancing backward, saw the take-off and the zoom.        The poor
fish!        was his mental comment.        If he shows that kind of stuff to
this squadron they       ll be needing a lot of replacements       or yelling
for a new instructor.       

47But the
appreciative ground crew, watching, expressed a different view.
       Boy!        exclaimed an envious Ack Emma.        Can that baby fly!
I       ll tell the world! Watch him out-climb McGee. Did you see how McGee took
off? Like a cadet doin        solo       afraid to lift her. And they say
he       s one of the best aces in the R.F.C. Huh! I think he       s got the
pip! Ever since he first touched his wheels to this        drome he       s been
yellin        about his motor bein        cranky. And it       s all jake. She
takes gas like a race horse takes rein.       

       Yeah,        growled a mechanic by the name of Flynn, who by nature
and nationality stood ready to defend anyone bearing the name of McGee,        a
lot you know about those little teapots in them Camels. You was trained on
Jennies and       and Fords! What you know about a Clerget engine could be
written on the back of a postage stamp. Say, do you know why he took her off so
gentle? Well, I       ll spread light in dark places, brother. He took off slow
because he knew you didn       t know nothin       , see?       

       Say, listen              

The quarrel went on, despite the fact that the two pilots constituting the
meatless bone of contention were rapidly becoming specks in the sky to the
northwest.

At five thousand feet McGee leveled off and swung slightly west. He looked
back and up. Larkin was <a
id='page_48'>48five hundred feet above him and somewhat behind, but
at McGee       s signal he dived down, taking up a position on the left. In this
manner they could point out objects below and engage in the sign language which
they had perfected through many hours spent in the air together.

As they flew along McGee felt his spirits mounting. It was a good world to
live in and life was made especially sweet and interesting by the soft unfolding
greens of a land brought to bud and blossom by April       s sun and showers. In
the beautiful panorama below there was nothing to indicate that a few miles to
the eastward mighty armies were striving over a tortured strip of blasted land
that for years to come would lie fruitless and barren. Here all was peace, with
never a hint       yes, far below on the white ribbon of roadway a long, dark
python was slowly dragging itself forward. It was a familiar sight to Larkin and
McGee       troops moving up to the theatre of war. And over on another road a
long procession of humpbacked brown toads were plodding eastward. Motor lorries,
carrying munitions and supplies. Strange monsters, these, to be coming from the
green fields and woods of a seeming peaceful countryside. Forward, ever forward
they made their way. Never, it seemed to McGee, had he seen roads choked with
returning men and munitions. Was the maw of the monster there to the eastward
bottomless and insatiable? <a
id='page_49'>49Where were the roads that led men back to the land of
living, green things?

As they passed over a town, McGee saw Larkin point down. On the outskirts of
the village a great cross in a circlet of green marked the location of a
military hospital. Ah!... Yes, some came back. But even then they must brand
their pain-racked sanctuary with the mercy imploring emblem of the Red Cross so
that enemy planes, bent on devastation, would mingle mercy with hope of victory
and save their bombs for those not yet carried into the long wards where
white-robed doctors and nurses battled with death and spoke words of hope to the
hopeless.

It was a sorry world! McGee, who but a few short minutes ago was entranced by
the beauty of the world, now felt a sudden, marked disgust. He pulled his stick
back sharply. He would climb out of it! He would get up against the ceiling,
where the world became a dim, faint blur or was lost altogether in a kindly
obliterating ground haze.

On McGee       s part the action was nothing more than an unconscious
reaction to distressing thoughts. Larkin, however, on seeing the sudden climb,
grinned with delight. This climb for altitude was nothing more than the prelude
to a dive that would start them into a merry game of hare and hound. So McGee
had forgotten all about his doleful sermon against dog-fighting? <span
class='pagenum pncolor'>50And so soon. Ha! Trust the
freckled        Little Shrimp        to feel blood racing through his veins when
motors are singing sweetly.

Instead of following, Larkin decided to nose down and offer more tantalizing
bait.

McGee, seeing the dive, found it more than he could resist. Besides, a merry
little chase would serve to wash the brooding thoughts from his mind. This was a
morning for sport, for jest, for youth       for hazard!

Forward went the stick and he plunged down the backwash of Larkin       s
diving plane, his motor roaring its cadenced challenge. This was something like!
Sky and ground were rushing toward each other. The braces were screaming like
banshees; the speed indicator hand was mounting with a steady march that made
one want to dive on and on and on until       

Larkin, in the plane ahead, brought his stick backward as he made ready to go
over in a tight loop. McGee smiled and followed him over. When they came out of
the loop they were in the same relative position       Larkin the hare, McGee
the tenacious hound.

For the next few minutes the open-mouthed countrymen in the fields below were
treated to a series of aerial gymnastics which must have sent their own pulses
racing and which might well serve them for fireside narration for years to
come.

51The two darting
hawks Immelmanned, looped, barrel-rolled, side-slipped, and then plunged into a
dizzy circle in which they flew round and round an imaginary axis, the radius of
the circle growing ever shorter and shorter. Every action of the leading plane
was immediately matched by the pursuer.

Larkin, realizing that his skill in manoeuvering was something less than
McGee       s, decided to bring the contest to a close with a few thrills in
hedge hopping.

Of all sports that offer high hazard to thrill satiated war pilots, that of
hedge hopping, or contour chasing, occupies first place. This is particularly
true when the pilot is flying a Sopwith Camel powered by the temperamental
Clerget motor with its malfunctioning wind driven gasoline pump. The sport had
been repeatedly forbidden by all the allied air commands, but these commands had
to deal with irrepressible youth, which has slight regard for doddering old
mossbacks who think that a plane should be handled as a wheel chair.

Larkin dived at the ground like a hawk that has sighted some napping rodent,
and so near did he come that by the time he had leveled off, his wheels were
almost touching the ground       and wheels must not touch when one is screaming
through space at the rate of a hundred and forty miles per hour.

He glanced back. Sure enough, McGee was still on his tail. No hedge hopping,
eh? Huh! Trust 52The
Shrimp to keep young, he thought. Fat chance they had of getting old. Who ever
heard of an old war pilot? Ha! That       s a good one! And here       s a
double row of tall poplars fringing the road directly ahead. Hold her close to
the ground and then zoom her at the last minute ... landing gears just clearing
the topmost branches ... make it, and that       s hedge hopping. Fail to make
it       and that       s bad news!

Larkin made it, a beautiful zoom that carried him over the trees by a
skillful margin. Then he swooped down again, skimming along the level field on
the other side of the road.

McGee       s zoom was just as spectacular and as nicely timed, but as his
nose climbed above the first row of trees his motor died as suddenly as though
throttled by the strangling hands of some unseen genii. Sudden though it was,
McGee had sensed that he was crowding the motor too much and had tried to ease
her off and still clear the trees. It was too late to relieve the choked motor
but he did clear the first row of trees. He was about to close his eyes against
the inevitable crash into the poplars on the other side of the road when he saw
that two of the trees had been felled, and that so recently that the woodsmen
had not yet worked them up. There was one clear chance left. If only he could
slip her over just far enough to clear the outstretched limbs of the tree to the
right.

At such a time seconds must be divided into hundredths, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>53and action must be instantaneous,
instinctive, and without flaw. McGee felt one of the spreading limbs brush
against his right wing tip, felt the plane swerve for a moment, then respond to
rudder and aileron. It was a case where one moment he was supremely thankful for
flying speed, and the next, as the ground of the level field was flashing under
the wheels, wishing that he had held to his resolution concerning hedge
hopping.

The wheels struck hard. The plane bounded, high, and again the wheels
touched. Again the plane bounded, and this time came down with a shock that left
McGee amazed with the realization that the undercarriage was intact and that he
still had a chance to keep her off her nose if only he could get the high-riding
tail down.

Crash! Crack! The tail was down now ... and broken to splinters, like as not.
Never mind.... By some great mercy he was at last on three points and rolling to
a stop.

He suddenly felt very weak. A narrow squeeze, that! Stupid way for an
ace       and an instructor       to get washed out. Like a Warrior falling off
his horse while on the way home from a victorious field.

He saw Larkin bank his ship into a tight turn, set the plane down in a
perfect landing and come careening down the open field to stop within a dozen
paces of McGee       s plane.

54Larkin,
white-faced, tight-lipped, crawled from his plane and came forward on the
double-quick. Not a word did he speak until he stood by the side of Red       s
plane, his hands gripping the leather piping at the edge of the cockpit until
his knuckles were white.

       What happened, Red? Gee, you       re white! All the freckles
gone.       

       Lucky I       m not gone!        McGee answered.        My knees are
too shaky to crawl out yet. It looked like finis la guerre pour moi for a
second.        He turned and blew a kiss at the gap in the trees.        Thanks,
Mr. Woodchopper, whoever you are. Buzz, never repeat that old poem about
       Woodman, spare that tree!        If he had spared those two       well! Take a
look at my tail skid, Old Timer. Is it broken off?       

       No. It       s cracked and sort of cockeyed, but a piece of wire from
that fence over there will fix it all O.K. What happened?       

McGee fixed him with a baleful glare.        You should ask       with as
much experience as both of us have had with these tricky motors. I choked it
down, that       s all. That same little fault has sent many a pilot home in a
wooden box. Go get me a piece of that wire. We       ll fix the skid, somehow,
and when I get to Le Bourget I       ll set her down on two points. And listen!
From here on in we do              

       No contour chasing,        Larkin completed, forcing a thin smile.
       Seems I heard that somewhere before. <a
id='page_55'>55Crawl out, Shrimp. You said you wanted to be out among
the flowers and sweet things. Well, here       s a sweet thing, and this field
is full of flowers. I brought you down low so you could enjoy them.       

       Yeah! I said I wanted to be among        em       not pushing
       em up. Hurry over and get that wire before I do something
violent.

Thirty minutes later two chastened pilots took off from the level field, with
a half dozen curious French peasants for an audience, and laid a straight course
for Le Bourget. No more acrobatics and no more hedge hopping. To an observer
below they would have resembled two homing pigeons flying rather close together
and maintaining their positions with a singleness of mind and purpose.

When they reached Le Bourget they circled the        drome once, noted the wind
socks on the great hangars, and dropped as lightly to the field as two tardy,
truant schoolboys seeking to gain entrance without attracting notice.

A newly arrived American squadron was stationed at the field, jubilant over
the fact that they were trying their skill on the fast climbing, fast flying
single-seater Spads. Five of these swift little hawks were now on the line,
making ready for a formation flight.

56McGee and Larkin
introduced themselves to the officer in command, presented their passes and
authority for refueling, and McGee requested that his tail skid be repaired and
his motor checked over.

       Let       s stick around and watch this formation flight,        McGee
then said to Larkin.        I want to see what these lads can do with a real
ship.       

       All right, but don       t get goggle-eyed. I came up here to see
Paris, and I       m thirty minutes behind time now.       

The take-off of the five Spads was good, and in order. McGee noticed with
considerable satisfaction that the flight commander knew his business, and the
four planes under his direction followed his signaled orders with a precision
that would have been creditable in any group of pilots.

       Nice work!        Red said to an American captain who seemed not at
all impressed.

The captain was six feet tall, burdened by the weight of rank and the ripe
old age of twenty-four or twenty-five years, and was somewhat skeptical of
McGee       s judgement. He wondered, vaguely, what this youthful,
freckle-faced, five-foot-six Royal Flying Corps lieutenant could know about nice
work. Why, he couldn       t be a day over eighteen       in fact, he might be
less than that. A cadet who had just won his wings, probably.

       Oh, fair,        the captain admitted.

57McGee, sensing
what was running through the captain       s mind, and having no wish to set him
right, winked at Larkin and said:

       Let       s go, Buzz. It isn       t often that two poor ferry pilots
get a twenty-four hour leave.       

Later, as they were bounding cityward in a decrepit, ancient taxi driven by a
bearded, grizzled Frenchman who without make-up could assume a role in a drama
of pirates and freebooters, McGee said to Larkin:

       You know, Buzz, I think a lot of these American pilots are better
prepared for action right now than we were when we got our wings. And we had
hardly gotten ours sewed on when we were ordered to the front. These fellows
will give a good account of themselves.       

       I think so, too. Do you remember how the Cadets of our class were sent
up for solo in rickety old planes held together by wire, tape and chewing gum?
Poor devils, they got washed out plenty fast! I       ve seen        em go up
when the expression on their faces told that they had forgotten everything they
had learned. No wonder a lot of them took nose dives into the hangars and hung
their planes on smokestacks and church steeples.       

McGee frowned, remembering some of the friends who had tried for their wings
and drew crosses instead. Quickly he threw off the mood with a laugh.

58       Yes, and I
was one of those        poor devils        who forgot. I       ll never forget
that! I had no more right being up in that old Avro than a hog has with
skates. But England needed pilots and needed them badly. I guess it was a case
of        what goes up must come down        and the government gave wings to the ones
who came down alive. The others got angels        wings.       

       I suppose so. And before another month passes the need will be greater
than ever. Look what the Germans did to the British Fifth Army just last month.
I       ll never know what stopped        em. But they       re not through.
What do you make of that long range gun that is shelling this very city?

       Um-m. Dunno. Seems to me that well directed reconnaissance flights
should be able to locate that gun.       

       Maybe; but locate it or not, its purpose is to drive war workers out
of Paris, cripple the hub of supplies and make it more difficult for us to
coordinate the service of supplies through here when they make their drive at
Paris. It       ll come within a month. Then we       ll need every pilot and
every ship that can get its wheels off the ground. I       m tellin       
you       a month!       

       Think so?       

       I know so! America is going to have her big chance       and may the
Lord help us if she doesn       t deliver! I don       t know how many combat
troops she has landed, but I do know that her eyes, the air <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>59service, is in need of ships. The French
and English are willing to give them all the old, worn out flying coffins that
they can pick up out of junk heaps       old two-seater Spads, old A.R.       s,
1-1/2 strutter Sopwiths, and crates like that. If they can get new Spads, like
those we saw        em flying this morning, or Nieuport 28       s, or the
Salmsons which their commander has been trying to get, then all will be jake.
Otherwise               he shrugged his shoulders expressively.

       Otherwise,        McGee took advantage of the pause,        Otherwise
they       ll deliver just the same, even if they have to fly Avros, Caudrons or
table tops. Buzz, these Americans over here have fight in their eyes.
They       ve got spirit.       

       Yes, but spirit can       t do much without equipment.       

       Huh! Ever read any history?       

       What       s on your mind now, little teacher? I read enough to pass
my exams in school.       

       Then you       ve forgotten some things about American history,
especially about spirit and equipment. Where was the equipment at Valley Forge?
What about the troops under Washington that took the breastworks at Yorktown
without a single round of powder       just bayonets? What about the war of
1812, when we had no army and the English thought we had no navy? You
don       t remember those              

       That       s just what I do remember,        Buzz interrupted,
       and that       s what I       m howling about. We <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>60never have been prepared with anything
except spirit. Right now we have a lot of good pilots over here and the air
service is having to beg planes from the French and English. And here we are,
sent down to this front to act as instructors to a shipless squadron, at the
very time when the Germans are making ready for another big drive. It       s
all wrong. Every minute is precious.       

McGee had been looking out of the window of the swaying, lurching cab that
was now threading its way through hurrying traffic.        Forget it!        he
said.        Give Old Man Worry a swift kick. Here we are in Gay Paree. The
war       s over for twenty-four hours!

To all allied soldiers on leave of absence from the front, Paris represented
what McGee had voiced to Larkin       a place where the war was over for the
time limits of their passes. Forgotten, for a few brief hours, were all the
memories of military tedium, the roar of guns, the mud of trenches, the flaming
airplane plunging earthward out of control       all these things were banished
by the stimulating thought that here was the world famous city with all its
amusements, its arts, its countless beauties, open to them for a few magic
hours.

The fact that Paris was only a ghost of her former <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>61self made no impression on war-weary
troopers. What mattered it, to them, that the priceless art treasures of the
Louvre had been removed to the safety of the southern interior? Was it their
concern that the once mighty and fearless Napoleon now lay blanketed by tons of
sand bags placed over his crypt to protect revered bones from enemy air raids or
a chance hit by the long range gun now shelling the city? What mattered it that
famous cafés and chefs were now reduced to the simplest of menus; what
difference did it make if the streets were darkened at night; who that had never
seen Paris in peace time could sense that she was a stricken city hiding her
sorrow and travail behind a mask of dogged, grim determination?

Paris was Paris, to the medley of soldiers gathered there from the four
points of the compass, and it was the more to her credit that she could still
offer amusement to uniformed men and boys whose war-weary minds found here
relief from the drive of duty.

Everywhere the streets were swarming with men in uniform       French,
English, Australian, Canadian, New Zealanders, colored French Colonials, a few
Russians who, following the sudden collapse of their government, were now
soldiers lacking a flag, Scotch Highlanders in their gaudy kilts, Japanese
officers in spick uniforms not yet baptized in the mud of the trenches       a
varied, colorful parade of young men bent on one great common objective.

62At night, the
common magnet was the theatre, and the Folies Bergeres, featuring a
humorous extravaganza, Zig Zag, in which was starred a famous English comedian,
drew its full quota of fun-seeking youths.

It was this show that McGee and Larkin had come to see, and at the end of the
first act they were ready to add their praises to the chorus of approval. During
the intermission they strolled out into the flag bedecked foyer to mingle with a
crowd that was ninety per cent military and which was in a highly appreciative
frame of mind. One particularly pleasing note had been added rather unexpectedly
when one of the feminine stars, in singing        Scotland Forever,        had
been interrupted by a group of Highlanders who boosted onto the stage a
red-headed, bandy-legged, kilted Scotchman who had the voice of a nightingale.
And when, somewhat abashed, he took up the refrain, he was joined by a
thunderous chorus from the audience that made the listeners certain that
Scotland would never die so long as such fervor remained in the hearts of her
sons. The English soldiers, not to be outdone, had followed with        God Save
the King        and then, down the aisle with a flag torn from the walls of the
foyer stalked an American sergeant, holding aloft Old Glory and leading his
countrymen in the singing of        The Star Spangled Banner.       

Trust a group of soldiers to take charge of a show <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>63and run it to suit themselves. But they
were pleased, beyond question, as was evidenced by the buzzing conversations
during the intermission.

       Great show, eh?       

       I       ll tell the world!       

       Hey, Joe! You old son-of-a-gun! How       d you get down here? Thought
you were wiped out up at Wipers.       

       Huh! Not me! They haven       t made the shell that can get me. Look
who       s over there with a nice cushy wound to keep him out of trouble. Old
Dog Face himself. Hey! Dog Face ... Come here!       

Such were the greetings of soldiers who hid their real feelings behind a mask
of flippancy.

McGee drew Larkin into an eddy of the milling throng where they could the
better watch what Red termed        the review of the nations.        A
strapping big Anzac, with a cockily rosetted Rough Rider hat, strolled arm in
arm with a French Blue Devil from the Alpine Chasseurs. A kilted Highlander,
three years absent from his homeland and bearing four wound stripes on his
sleeve, was trying vainly to teach the words of        Scotland Forever       
to a Russian officer whose precise English did not encompass the confusing
Scotch burr. Mixed tongues, mixed customs, variety of ideals; infantrymen,
cavalrymen, artillerymen, war pilots; men with grey at the temples and beardless
youths; here and there a man on crutches, here <a
id='page_64'>64and there an empty sleeve, and many breasts upon which
hung medals awarded for intrepid courage; here grizzled old Frenchmen with backs
bowed by three years of warfare, and there fresh, clean young Americans recently
landed and a little amazed that they should be looked upon as the hope of the
staggering allies. Color, color, color! Confused tongues, the buzz and babble of
a thousand half-heard conversations, the fragments of marching songs! Here was a
cross section of the Allied Armies, all of them with but one purpose. How could
they fail!

The scene had a telling effect upon McGee and Larkin. Wordless, for a few
minutes, they stood watching the throng. It was McGee who spoke first.

       Did you ever see anything like it, Buzz? Just look at the different
uniforms. There       look over there! A bunch of American Blue Jackets. Wonder
how they got here?       

       Humph! Wonder how all of us got here? That       s what I       ve
been thinking about. This is just a moment snatched from the lives of all these
fellows. What went before? What homes did they come from, and who is waiting for
them? And what comes to them to-morrow? Gee!        He shook his head, slowly.
       It doesn       t do to think about it. You want to find out about them
... and you get to wishing they could all go on back home to-morrow. Say, who
started this talk, anyhow? Come on, let       s go back in.       

65       Wait a
minute!        McGee seized his arm and turned him around.        There       s
plenty of time before the curtain. Look, Buzz. See that black fellow over there
in French Colonial O.D.? Came from Algiers, I guess, or Senegal, maybe. What
brought him here, and what sort of stories will he tell ... when he gets back
home? Will he tell about what he did, or will he talk about what he saw and what
others did?       

       Dunno. Why?       

       Well, this has set me to thinking. We       re all here on exactly the
same business. The uniform doesn       t count so much, nor does the branch of
the service. It       s just a question of getting the job done       a sort of
       Heave Ho! All together, now!        Get me?       

       Yes       I guess so. What are you driving at?       

       This. See that American sergeant over there       the one who carried
the flag down the aisle and jumped up on the stage?       

       Yes. Big fellow, isn       t he?       

       You said it! The biggest duck in this puddle, in more ways than one.
And I want to get into the uniform he is wearing. Understand, Buzz? Oh,
I       m proud enough of the one I       m wearing, but when he started the
national anthem, and they all came in on that chorus,        Oh, say can you see, by
the dawn       s early light,              well, I felt cold shivers running up
and down my backbone. None of the other songs did that to me. Do you get me,
Buzz?       

66       Sure. I
felt it, too.        He put both his hands on Red       s shoulders, holding him
off at arm       s length.        You want back under the old Stars and Stripes,
don       t you? ... you little shrimp!       

       Yes,        slowly,        and       yet              

       I know how you feel. I       m with you, fellow, when you get ready to
make the change.       

McGee       s eyes lighted with surprise and joy.        Really,
Buzz?       

       Surest thing you know!       

       And you don       t think we       d feel
like       like              

       We       d feel like two Americans, going home. Shake, little
feller! There, I feel better already. Come on, let       s go in; that       s
the curtain bell.       


67CHAPTER IIINight Raiders


1


On the following Tuesday morning a group of two Spads and several Nieuports
were delivered to Major Cowan       s pursuit squadron at Is Sur Tille. A
Lieutenant Smoot, one of the ferry pilots who had flown up one of the Nieuports,
sought to ease the pain caused by his own lowly calling by taunting Tex
Yancey       an extremely dangerous pastime, for Tex had a ready tongue.

       When you buckoes have washed out these planes,        he said,
       the Old Man will see the error of his way and send us up to do the real
flying. What       s left of this gang will then be put to ferrying. Did any of
you ever see a Spad or Nieuport before?       

Yancey, standing well over six feet, looked down on him pityingly.        Did
you say your name was Smoot, or Snoot? Smoot, eh. Well, transportation to the
rear is waitin        for you at headquarters. Don       t let me keep you
waitin       . I       m surprised you       re not pushin        a wheelbarrow
in a labor battalion, the way you set that Nieuport down a few minutes ago.
Clear out, 68 soldier!
This squadron is gettin        ready to do some plain and fancy flyin       . I
don       t want you to have heart trouble.       

       Humph! You       ll have heart trouble the first time you try to land
one of those Spads. You       ll think you have been trained on a peanut
roaster. Who       s the Britisher over there snooping around with
Cowan?       

       Name       s McGee. But he       s not a Limey; he       s an
American. I       m told he won a coupla medals in the R.F.C., and has sixteen
Huns to his credit. He must be good       though he doesn       t wear the
medals to prove it. Not a bit of swank.       

       What       s he doing here?       

       He       s an instructor,        Yancey replied without
hesitation.

       Oh Ho! So you still need instruction? I heard that Cowan knows it
all.       

       Naw, he only knows half, and you know the other half. Too bad both
sets of brains wasn       t put in one head. In that case somebody would have
been almost half-witted. Better toddle along, soldier. The animals are
goin        on a rampage in a minute.       

       Yeah? Well, turn        em loose. I       m something of a big game
hunter myself. What sort of a flyer is this instructor?       

       Dunno. We       ll see in a minute, maybe. He       s crawling in that
Spad. Yep, they       re turnin        her <a
id='page_69'>69around. Don       t go now. You can learn a lot
here.       

During the next ten minutes the entire squadron, and the ferry pilots, were
given an excellent opportunity to form their own conclusions about McGee       s
ability to fly. He took the Spad aloft, in test, and plunged through a series of
acrobatics that served to convince all watchers that here was a man whose real
element was the air. Ship and man were one.

The group on the ground watched, open-mouthed, despite the fact that they
themselves were flyers of no mean ability. But they had never flown such ships
as the Spads, and the prospect and possibilities made their hearts race with
feverish eagerness to take off in one of these trim little hawks.

Yancey and Smoot had now joined the watching group around Major Cowan, and as
McGee rolled at the top of a loop, Yancey turned to the doubting ferry
pilot.

       Yes, I think he can fly. What do you think, brother? When you can do
stick work like that, you       ll be sent up here to join us.       

Major Cowan was equally envious, but he was not one to betray it.        A
very bad example,        he commented, testily.        An excellent pilot,
doubtless, but reckless. His take-off, for instance. He zoomed too long. I want
to warn you against such a mistake.       

The ferry pilot, Smoot, decided to take a chance.        The example seems
good enough, and if that fellow       s <a
id='page_70'>70flying is a mistake, I       m sure Brigade would like
to see a lot more mistakes like him.       

       The commander of this squadron will answer to Brigade for the conduct
of this group, Lieutenant Smoot,        Major Cowan retorted with such acidity
that the poor ferryman decided it was time to join his own group and head for
the base. But before taking his departure he relieved his mind in the presence
of Yancey, Siddons and Hampden, who had drawn away from Cowan through a desire
to watch the flying rather than listen to his lectures on the art of flying.

       If you had a flyer like that one up there for a C.O.,        Smoot
said to them,        you       d get somewhere in this little old war. But as it
is, you have my sympathy. Well, toodle-oo, mes enfants. Be careful with
those Spads. They were built for flyers.       

       You be careful that you don       t fall out of that motor cycle side
car on the way back,        Yancey retorted.        They look like baby
carriages, but they       re not.       

As Smoot walked away, stung by this last retort, Yancey turned to Hampden and
Siddons.        How       d you like to have a flyer like that in this
outfit?        he asked.

       He       s all right,        Hampden replied.        A lot of the
ferry pilots are crack flyers       just a tough break in the game. It might
have happened to you.       

       I wasn       t talkin        about him        Yancey replied
and 71pointed to
McGee       s plane, now banking in to a landing at the far end of the field.
       I meant that bird down there.       

       Oh, McGee?       

       Yes.       

Hampden laughed, skeptically.        Fine chance to get a flyer like
that!       

       Oh, I dunno. Some American outfit will draw him. He and that other
fellow, Larkin, have asked to be repatriated.       

       How do you know?       

       I was with        em in town last night and they told me all about it.
They flew up to Paris day before yesterday, and on the way back they landed at
Chaumont and made a call on G.H.Q. They put their case before the Chief of Staff
and asked him to use his influence. They       ve made out formal application.
Both of them are tickled pink over the prospect. McGee said he would like to get
with this squadron.       

       Bully for him!        Hampden enthused.        Maybe we don       t
look so bad, if fellows like that are willing to throw in with us, eh,
Tex?       

Siddons was coldly skeptical.        You have the weirdest imagination. Why
should he want to be with us?       

       Dunno. Ask him.       

       I shall,        Siddons answered as he moved over toward the point
where he estimated McGee       s taxiing plane would come to a stop.

72       Big
stiff!        Yancey said under his breath.        He       ll ask him, all
right, and right out in meetin       . He never believes anything he hears until
he has asked a thousand questions about it. What do you see in that fellow to
like, Hamp?       

       He       s all right, Tex. He was pretty decent to me while I was
acting as Supply during that time Cowan grounded me. Came around to help me with
the paper work and put in a good word for me.       

       Yeah, he       s always chummy with Supply and Operations       but
only because he thinks he can get some favors that way. I despise
him.       

       Oh, come now! You mustn       t feel that way. We are all in the same
boat, and we       d as well be chummy.       

       Huh! If you ever get in the same boat with that fellow he will do the
steerin        while you do the rowin       . He gives me a pain!

Two weeks later orders came down concentrating several pursuit, observation
and bombing groups in the neighborhoods of Commercy and Nancy. The members of
the squadrons to which McGee and Larkin had been detailed were feverish with
excitement. Operations and armament officers were busy with the duties incident
to making all planes ready for <a
id='page_73'>73combat. This could mean but one
thing       Action!

Three nights after the move McGee and Larkin sat at a late dinner in one of
the little cafés on the main street of the small French town. They were
discussing the progress of their work and each was heatedly contending that his
own group was superior in every way.

       Just come over and watch my flight do formation work,        Larkin
urged.        They       ll open your eyes.       

       Humph! You       d better open your own eyes! I have watched you. We
were up in the sun this morning       five thousand feet above you       and
watched you for half an hour. A fine bunch you have! We could have smothered you
like a blanket. Have you ever shown them anything about looking in the sun for
enemy planes?       

Larkin       s face evidenced his chagrin.        Are you kidding
me?       

       Not much! We kept right along above you, but in the sun. I       ll
admit they did good work, but oh, how blind! Boy, we       re not too far back
to get jumped on. There have been fights farther back from the lines than this.
You know Fritz dearly loves to raid        dromes where new squadrons are in training.
Believe me, their spy system is perfect. I       d be willing to wager my right
eye that they know these groups are stationed in this area, how long they have
been in France, and just what types of planes we are using. <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>74They       ve the best spy system in the
world. You know how many times they have raided green squadrons. They figure it
puts the wind up a bunch of inexperienced men. So keep your eye peeled. And if
you want to see something pretty, come over and watch my gang. They       re
ready for combat work right now       except Siddons.       

Larkin looked up in surprise.        I thought you told me he knew more about
the planes and about flying than any of the others.       

       He does. But he can       t       or won       t       keep in
formation. He cuts out, and goes joy-riding.       

       Seems to me I remember someone else who used to do that same little
stunt,        Larkin said, smiling reminiscently.

McGee flushed.        Yes, I suppose I did, but not in training. I never cut
formation until              

       Until you saw something that looked like meat. Don       t try to kid
me, Red. You       ve dragged me into too many dog fights. Do you think I have
forgotten the day we were out having a look-see, five of us, and spotted five
Albatrosses below? Bingo! Down you went like a shot, and the rest of us had to
follow to keep you from being made into mincemeat. Talk about being blind! All
the time a bigger flock of Fokkers were in the sun above us and they came down
like        wolves on the fold.        Fellow, you had your little faults. Don       t
be too hard on Siddons.       

75       Cutting
formation to get in a fight and cutting to go joy-riding are two different
things. If it were anyone else but Siddons I       d ask Cowan to ground
him.       

       You like him?       

       Emphatically, NO! And he knows it. That       s why I hesitate to make
an example of him. He would think that I was satisfying a grudge. Besides, he
has some sort of a drag with someone. Cowan thinks he is a great flyer. He is,
too. Knows more about both the technical and practical side of the game than any
of the others. That       s what       s wrong with him. He is so
self-satisfied, so arrogant, and so cocksure of every word he utters and every
movement he makes. He is the coldest fish I ever met. He reminds me of
someone       but I can       t remember who it is. Sometimes I think he
is       Listen! What       s that?       

McGee       s question went unanswered as the shrill blasts of the air raid
siren shattered the peace of the village with its frenzied warning. It moaned,
deep-throated, then became panic-stricken and wailed tremulously in the higher
registers. It was a warning to all to seek the comparative safety of the
abris which the town had constructed against just such an emergency.

The café emptied quickly, but even the quickest followed on the heels of
McGee and Larkin who, once outside, ran briskly down the street toward the house
where they were billeted. They halted at the drive <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>76entrance to gaze upward as great
searchlights began playing upon the dark inverted bowl of the heavens. The long,
shifting beams of light were accusing fingers seeking to point out the
unwelcome, stealthy nocturnal sky prowlers.

       Listen!        McGee gripped Larkin       s arm.

Sure enough, from the east, and high above, came the sound of German motors,
a sound unmistakable by anyone who had once heard their unsynchronized drone. It
rose and fell, rose and fell, like the hurried snoring of a giant made restless
by nightmare. The sound was drawing nearer. Doubtless it had been heard by the
soldiers manning the searchlights for the beams now swept restlessly across the
eastern sky. To the eastward, two or three kilometers, an anti-aircraft battery
opened fire, and from aloft came the dull pouf! of the exploding shells.
Vain, futile effort! It was only the angry thundering of admitted helplessness.
One chance in a million! The motors droned on, coming nearer and nearer. Excited
townspeople, in wooden sabots, clattered down the streets seeking shelter;
fear-stricken mothers and fathers spoke sharply to their little broods as they
hustled them along.

       Buzz,        Red said,        it       s dollars to doughnuts
they       re coming here to lay some eggs on our        drome       just to put the
wind up these boys. Remember what I told you a few minutes ago.       

77Larkin was more
hopeful.        I guess not,        he said.        Headed for some supply base
or ammunition dump farther in, would be my guess. But if they are coming here,
there       s little we can do about it. It       s up to the anti-aircraft
boys.       

       Hum-m,        McGee mused.        I wonder.       

A motor cycle, with side car, running without lights, came popping down the
street. Without hesitation McGee ran out into the middle of the street, waving
his arms and shouting wildly. The motor cycle swerved sharply, missed the
dancing, gesticulating figure and skidded to a stop.

       Say, what       s eatin        you, soldier?        demanded the irate
American motor cycle orderly.

For answer McGee sprang into the side car and barked a few crisp, sharp
orders that brooked no hesitation. The responsive little motor roared its
staccato eagerness as the machine lurched forward, leaving Larkin speechless and
wondering.

       What do you know about that?        he mused.        Now what can that
little shrimp be up               he hesitated, struck by the same thought, he
felt sure, that had plunged McGee into such sudden action. Then he began
shouting for the driver of their motor car.

       Martins! Martins! Oh, Martins!        Blast the fellow, doubtless he
was already in some place of security.        Martins! Oh, Martins!       

A door flew open, letting out a beam of light as <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>78Martins came out, clad only in his
underclothes and yawning prodigiously.

       Did you call, sir?        he asked, blinking foolishly as he studied
the flashing rays of the sky-searching lights.

       Yes! Get the car! Snappy, now!       

       Yes, sir. Just as soon as I can get on some clothes.       

       Hang the clothes! Get the car       and set the road afire between
here and the        drome. Move! Don       t stand there blinking like a blooming
owl.       

Martins sped around the house, a white-clad figure racing bare-footed for the
car and muttering under his breath every time his flying feet struck bits of
gravel and sharp stones. The sound of the airplane motors was now much nearer;
the siren was still screaming its fright; anti-aircraft guns were futilely
belching steel into the air, and the searchlights were getting jumpy in their
haste to locate the intruders and hold them in a beam of light.

Martins, with Larkin seated at his side, hurled the car through the narrow
streets and out to the airdrome with a daring recklessness known only to
war-trained chauffeurs who could push a car faster without lights than most
people would care to ride in <a
id='page_79'>79broad daylight. But their speed was slow compared to
that made by the surprised motor cycle orderly who had thundered off with McGee,
and when Larkin sprang from the car as it screeched to a stop at the edge of the
       drome his ear caught the sound of a Clerget motor pounding under an advanced
throttle as it lifted a plane from the ground at the far end of the dark field.
An excited, buzzing group of pilots and mechanics were huddled together on the
tarmac near the circus tent that served as a hangar, and still more men were
emerging hastily from the humpbacked, black steel elephants that served them as
quarters.

Larkin ran toward the group near the hangar entrance,

       Where       s McGee?        he shouted, knowing the answer but hoping
for some word that would give the lie to what his ears told him. He knew that
the plane which had now swung back over the field and was roaring directly above
as it battled for altitude was none other than McGee       s balky little Camel.
But no one answered him; they merely stared, as men who have just witnessed a
feat of daring too noble for words, or as girls who face an impending tragedy
and are too horror-stricken for action.

       Where       s McGee?        Larkin shouted again.        Don       t
stand there like a bunch of yaps! You       ll be getting a setting of high
explosive eggs here in a minute. <a
id='page_80'>80Don       t you hear that siren? Those Boche planes?
Where       s McGee, I asked you?       

Yancey stepped from the group and pointed up.

       I reckon that       s him up yonder,        he said in the slow drawl
that was doubly maddening at such a moment.        He blew in here a few minutes
ago like a Texas Panhandle twister, ordered the greaseballs to roll his plane on
the line, and was off before she was good and warm. I reckon              

Larkin did not wait to learn what Yancey reckoned. He dashed toward the
hangar, shouting orders as he ran.

Major Cowan stepped from the hangar, barring the way.        Just a minute,
Lieutenant! What is it you want?       

       What do I want? I want a plane on the line       quick!       

       No! Lieutenant McGee took off before we knew what it was all about. It
is madness. You can       t have              

He stopped speaking to listen. From high above, and a little to the east,
came the throbbing sound of German motors that in a few more seconds would be
over the airdrome. Indeed, they might be circling now, getting their bearing and
making sure of location. At that moment one of the large motor mounted
searchlights near the hangar began combing the sky.

       Go tell those saps to cut that light!        Larkin <span
class='pagenum pncolor'>81shouted, hoping that the
Major would be stampeded into action that would provide the slenderest chance
for him to get the mechanics to roll a Spad to the line before Cowan could know
what was happening.        Better cut it! If the others can       t find
       em, this one can       t. It will only serve as a path of light for one
of those babies up there to slide down and leave you some presents you
don       t want.       

Major Cowan was not one to go legging it about on errands. Besides,
searchlights were provided for just such uses. Then too, he rather suspected
Larkin       s motives, and Larkin realized this.

       Please let me have one of those Spads, Major,        he pleaded.
       Can       t you understand       McGee and I are buddies. With two of us
up there we might turn        em back.       

       No! It is too hazardous. This squadron is still in training. We are
not trained as night flyers, and certainly are not prepared to give combat to a
flight of bombers.       

Larkin       s anger smashed through his long training. All rank faded from
his mind.

       Not trained, eh? Major Cowan, that freckle-faced kid up there is a
night flying fool       and I       m his twin brother. Get out of my way. Oh,
greaseballs! Hey, you Ack Emmas! Roll out one of those Spads
and              

       Lieutenant!        Cowan barked.        You forget yourself. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'>82If you want to do night
fighting go over to your own group and use your own plane! You forget yourself.
I am still in command here!       

From aloft came the momentary stutter of two machine guns. Ah! McGee testing
and warming his guns as he climbed. Oh, the fool! The precious, daring fool!

Larkin sat down on the tarmac, ker plunk!Let        em raid. What
mattered it? He rather hoped one of them would be accurate enough to plant a
bomb on the top of Cowan       s head.

       Yes, you are in command,        he said, rather limply,        but why
didn       t you stop McGee? And since you are in command, in Heaven       s
name tell that light crew to cut that light. It would be just their fool,
blundering luck to spot McGee and hold him for the Archies.

McGee, holding up the nose of his Camel at an angle that gave the motor every
ounce it would stand, was thinking the same alarming thought that had just run
through Larkin       s mind. It would be just his luck to be spotted by the
searchlight crew and held in its beam. If so, would they recognize him? Would
they see the ringed cockades on his wings, or would eager anti-aircraft gunners
start blazing away? Even if they recognized the plane, his whole plan would be
knocked into a cocked hat should that telltale streamer of light point him out
to the enemy planes above who must now be looking sharp. Darkness was both his
ally and his foe.

McGee was too experienced to have any mistaken notions about the hazard of
his endeavor. He knew what he was up against. In the first place, any bombing
plane was a formidable foe, and he could not know how many were coming on this
mission. All bombers were heavily armed, and had the advantage of having at
least one man free to repel attack <a
id='page_84'>84with twin machine guns. Many of the heavier German
bombing planes carried crews of four or five men, though these were used in
attack on highly important bases and would hardly be sent on a mission of this
nature. Such machines were quite slow and not capable of being manoeuvered
quickly, but their very size added to their invulnerability and their heavy
armament made them a thing to be avoided by any single fighter mounted in a
pursuit plane. Many pursuit pilots had learned the bitter lesson attached to a
thoughtless, poorly planned attack upon a bomber or two-seater observation bus.
They looked like an appetizing meal       but one must have a strong stomach if
he finishes the feast.

McGee knew, also, that the oncoming raiders might be pursuit planes converted
into bombers by the simple expedient of attaching bomb releases carrying lighter
pellets of destruction which could be released by the pilot. This was not an
unusual procedure, especially when the success of the venture might hinge upon
speed. Such planes could strike swiftly, more easily avoid Archie fire, and
having struck their blow could outdistance any antagonist with the nerve to
storm through the night sky in pursuit.

So, as McGee climbed he realized that he was facing the unknown. The prospect
of a raid had been his challenge; the size and strength of his enemy was
unknown. So be it, he thought, and warmed his guns <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>85with a short burst as he continued
climbing. Their quick chatter served to reassure him and for the moment he quite
forgot how useless they would be should he chance to go crashing into one of the
bombers. He felt that all would be well if only those saps on the ground would
cut that searchlight. Didn       t they know that it would simply serve as a
guide to the plane whose mission it would be to dive at the field and release
ground flares to mark the target for the bombers? Of course they wouldn       t
think of that. Green! And with a lot to learn.

Two or three times the beam of light flashed perilously near him, and once
his plane was near enough to the edge of the beam for the glass on his
instrument board to reflect the rays. Then, a moment later, the glaring one-eyed
monster dimmed, glowed red, and darkness leaped in from all sides. But only for
a moment. Other lights, from more distant points, were still combing the sky.
These concerned Red not so much as the one near the hangar. Strangely, as is the
way with men at war, he cared not so much what wrath might be called down on
other places if only his own nest remained unviolated. Indeed, he found himself
entertaining the hope that the raiders might become confused and drop their
trophies in somebody else       s back yard.

Then, as suddenly as a magician produces an object out of the thin air, one
of the distant searchlights <a
id='page_86'>86fixed upon one of the enemy planes. It was a single
seater, McGee noted, and though somewhat southeast of the position he had
expected, it was already pointing its nose down on a long dive that would
undoubtedly carry it to a good position over the        drome for dropping flares.

McGee knew the tactics. This was the plane whose job it was to spot the
target for the bombers and then zoom away. Then the vultures would come droning
over the illuminated field and drop their eggs.

Red kicked his left rudder and came around on a sharp climbing bank. By
skill, or by luck, the light crew still held their beam on the black-crossed
plane and in a twinkling two other lights were centered on it.

McGee made a quick estimate of distance and of the other       s flying
speed. Then he nosed over, slightly, on a full throttle, and drove along a line
which he thought would intersect the dive of the enemy. He could hardly hope to
get him in the ring sights; it was a matter of pointing the plane in what he
thought was the correct line of fire and let drive with both guns.

The wind was beginning to scream and tear at the struts of the hard-pushed
Camel. Speed was everything now. If that diving German plane once dropped its
flares, the others, somewhere in the darkness above, would sow destruction on
the field.

87The distance was
yet too great for anything like effective fire, but McGee decided to take a
chance. After all, the whole thing was chance. He had one chance in a thousand
to thwart their plans, very slim chances for bagging one of them, and some
excellent chances to get bagged!

       Very well,        he found himself saying in answer to these swift
thoughts.        Carry on!       

Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat! Both his guns began their scolding chatter. Too far to
the right       and below. He ruddered left and pulled her nose up a trifle.
There! Again the guns spewed out their vengeful chorus.

At this second burst the German plane seemed to yaw off, then righted itself,
leveled off and flew straight at McGee.

Red felt a momentary elation that the enemy had at least been made conscious
of the attack and was, for the moment, forced to abandon his objective. Two
beams of light still held him mercilessly. Doubtless they served to blind him
and this advantaged McGee who, unseen in the darkness, kept his Vickers going.
Some of the bullets must have gone home for the German swerved suddenly and
began a series of acrobatics in an effort to escape the lights. But disturbed as
he was, he evidently kept his mission in mind for he continued to lose altitude
and thus draw nearer the field where he could drop his flares.

88McGee decided to
nose over and then zoom up under his belly       by far the most vulnerable
point of attack but one in which the moment of fire is brief indeed, for Camels
will not long hang by their        props.       

Just as McGee dived the enemy swerved quickly and also began a dive. His
diving angle was sharp; his speed tremendous. Doubtless he had determined to
carry out his mission and get away from an exceedingly hot spot as quickly as
possible. By the fortunes of war his diving angle cut directly across
McGee       s path. Close       almost too close! A brief burst spat from
McGee       s Vickers in that heart-chilling moment when collision seemed
inevitable, but McGee pulled sharply back on his stick and zoomed. Whew! It was
no cinch, this fighting a light-blinded enemy.

McGee glanced back. The lights had lost the plane as suddenly as they had
found it. Night had swallowed it. Now there was an unseen enemy that
might       

Ah! McGee sucked in his breath sharply. A tiny tongue of flame was shooting
through the sky. For a second it was little more than the flame of a match, but
in a few seconds it developed into greedy, licking flames that turned the German
plane into a flaming rocket. The pilot, manfully seeking escape from such a
death, began side slipping in a vain effort to create an upward draft that would
keep the flames 89from
incinerating him in his seat. For the briefest moment he did a first class job
of it, and McGee, who a minute before had been hungry for victory, felt first a
wave of admiration for a skillful job of flying and next a surge of pity that it
must be of no avail. Even now the plane was wobbling out of control ... then it
nosed over and plunged earthward, a flaming meteor.

Fascinated, McGee watched the plunge, climbing a little as he circled. He was
three times an ace with two for good measure, seventeen victories in the air,
but this was his first night flamer. It was far more spectacular than he could
have imagined ... and somehow a little more unnerving. A moment ago that doomed
creature had been a man courageous enough to undertake any hazard his country
demanded. Enemy or no, he was a man of courage and in his own country was a
patriot.

McGee felt very weak, and not at all elated. After all, he knew there were no
national boundaries to valor or patriotism, and however sweet the victory it
must always carry the wormwood of regret that the vanquished will see no more
red dawnings and go out on no more dawn patrols. That plunging, flaming plane
was as a lighted match dropped into a deep well       the deep well of
oblivion.

The plane struck the earth some three or four hundred yards to the west of
the        drome. The flames, <a
id='page_90'>90leaping afresh, lighted up the entire vicinity. McGee,
looking down, could see the dim outline of the hangar tent and the running
figures that were racing toward the burning plane. He smiled, rather grimly, and
his eyes searched the heavens above him. The vultures had their target now!

At that moment one of the restless searchlights singled out one of the
bombers, high above him, and two other streams of light leaped to the same spot.
Another plane was caught in the beam. The anti-aircraft now had their target,
and they lost no time. There came two or three of the sharp barks so
characteristic of anti-aircraft guns, and coincident with the sound the bursting
shells bloomed into great white roses perilously near the leading plane. It
rocked, noticeably, and shifted its course. Then, seemingly, all the Archies in
the countryside, within range and out of range, began filling that section of
the sky with magically appearing roses that in their blooming sent steel balls
and flying fragments searching the sky.

The upper air was quickly converted into an inferno of bursting shells and
whining missiles of jagged steel. The enemy bombers, due to the delay caused by
McGee       s unexpected attack upon the plane whose mission it had been to drop
the ground flares, had now worked themselves into a rather awkward formation and
were faced with the responsibility of making instant decision whether they
should now 91release
their bombs in a somewhat hit or miss fashion or run for it and individually
select some other spot for depositing their T.N.T. hate as they made their way
homeward.

The embarrassment of their position was but little greater than that of
McGee       s. The burning plane offered sufficient light for landing, but it
was also lighting up the hangars and the field, and he momentarily expected the
enemy to let go with their bombs. It would not be pleasant down there when those
whistling messengers began to arrive. His present position was equally
unhealthy, even though he had considerably reduced his altitude. Any
minute       yes, any second       some searchlight crew might pick him up, and
there is never any telling what an excited anti-aircraft battery crew might
do.

McGee made the decision which is always reached by an airman who finds
himself in unhealthy surroundings: he would simply high-tail it away from there
until        the shouting and the tumult        subsided. He swung into the dark
sky to the north and then dived down until he felt that any less altitude would
be extremely likely to bring him afoul of some church steeple or factory
smokestack.

One of the German pilots decided to take a chance and release his bombs.
Their reverberating detonations were terrifying enough, but aside from the ugly
holes they made in the open field, some five hundred <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>92yards away from the        drome, they
accomplished nothing in the balance of warfare. The other planes, finding the
welcome a bit too warm, took up a zig-zag course toward the Fatherland, but in a
general course that would take them back over Nancy, where they could find a
larger target for their bombs.

McGee, looking back, could see the searchlights sweeping eastward in their
efforts to keep the fleeing planes spotted. But their luck had already been
great indeed, and now they were again feverishly searching the black and
seemingly empty sky.

       Good time to tool this baby home,        McGee thought as he swung
around and headed for the        drome, its location still well marked for him by the
flickering flames of the fallen ship.

       Poor old Nancy!        he said aloud as he realized that the thwarted
bombers would likely spew out their hate on that sorely tried city.
       I       m sorry to wish this off on you, but you are used to it and these
lads are not. Talk about luck! I wonder what good angel is perched on my
shoulder.       

Back over the        drome he signaled with his Very light pistol for landing
lights, his take-off having been too sudden to permit of thinking of ground
flares. He circled the field, waiting for the lights. No response. He signaled
again. Still no response.

       Too much excitement, I guess,        he mused. Then he flew low over
the remains of the burning plane, <a
id='page_93'>93around which had gathered a large group       large
enough, McGee thought, to include every man of the squadron from the C.O. down
to the lowliest greaseball.

       Humph! A fine target you       d make!        Red snorted, and felt
like throwing his Very pistol into the group.        Well, here goes! I       ve
made darker landings than this. And if I crack up               he smiled as a
grim Irish bull flashed through his mind              it will be a good lesson
to the ground crew. Nothing like Irish humor at a time like this.

If one who stands less than five feet six and is freckled of face and red of
hair can command hauteur and dignity, then it can be said that a few minutes
later McGee, with hauteur and dignity, strode into the excited, gabbling group
that surrounded the burning German plane. For a moment none of them recognized
him. With hands on hips, arms akimbo, he stood watching them. He was still just
a little too mad to trust his tongue.

Major Cowan was the first to notice him.        Ah! Lieutenant McGee! I
am              

       No sir, I am Lieutenant McGee       s ghost. McGee got his neck broken
over there just now       trying to make a landing in the dark. Your ground crew
were 94exceedingly
helpful to him, Major. So nice of them to obey his signals so
promptly.       

For once Cowan was at a disadvantage.        Gad, man! Did you
signal?       

       Oh, yes. I waved my hand. Rather original idea, don       t you think?
Perhaps you weren       t expecting me to come back.       

       Frankly, Lieutenant, I wasn       t.        The look on Cowan       s
face was one of genuine admiration.        You have done a courageous thing,
Lieutenant       and I thought it foolhardy. I said as much to Lieutenant
Larkin, and I apologize to you, here, in the presence of all these men who
witnessed your courage.       

All the others thereupon surged around McGee, pumping his hand vigorously and
clapping him on the back.

McGee       s anger faded. It was a thing that never stayed long with
him.

       Is Larkin here?        he asked.

       He was,        Cowan answered.        Came a few minutes after you
took off, but when I refused him a ship he got mad as a hornet, bawled out the
light crew and       and me, and then jumped back in his car and rode off.
Rather tempestuous fellow.       

       If he had stayed here,        McGee said, regretfully,        my Camel
wouldn       t now be standing over yonder on its nose with its undercarriage
wiped off. He       d at least think of landing lights.        He pushed his way
95through the crowd
toward the burning embers of the twisted, broken and charred plane.        Pilot
burned to a crisp, I suppose,        he mused half aloud.

Hampden, who was standing nearest, answered:

       No, the poor devil jumped. Landed over there by the road. They carried
him over to the hospital tent. Not a       a whole bone in his body.        His
voice seemed choked.        It       s a       a fearful way to go.       

       A sporting way, I would say,        Siddons spoke up.        Even in
the last moment he rather cheated you, McGee. He escaped the flames,
anyhow.       

McGee looked at Siddons searchingly. In those cold grey eyes and in the
half-taunting smile there was none of the sympathy or natural, normal emotion
that had so choked Hampden       s voice.

       He did not cheat me, Lieutenant Siddons,        McGee said, his voice
edged by his dislike of the man.        I am only one of the small factors in
this unfortunate game. Duty may be pursued without wanting to see others suffer.
He was a brave man. I salute him.        He turned to Cowan.        Major Cowan,
if your crew had attempted to extinguish these flames we might have added a
great deal to our knowledge of the progress the enemy is making. I could not
recognize this plane in the air. I think it is a new type.       

       By Jove! I never thought of it.       

McGee turned away to conceal an expression which <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>96he could not control, and as he did so he
heard Yancey growl to Hampden:

       What a first-rate kitchen police in a Home Guard outfit that bimbo
would make!       

As McGee walked back toward the hangar, Hampden and Siddons joined him. He
felt Hampden give his elbow a congratulatory squeeze. Then Siddons said:

       Are you going over to have a look at your fallen adversary,
Lieutenant?       

       Oh, I say, Siddons!        Hampden exclaimed, pained and
surprised.

       I am going to make out my report,        McGee answered, simply.
       I wonder if you would like to give me a confirmation, Lieutenant
Siddons?       

The question took Siddons off his feet.        Why       er       do you
really want me to?       

       Not especially; I just had a feeling that you would be pleased to have
your name brought in it somehow.       

Several of the pilots followed McGee into the hut used for headquarters, but
Siddons was not among them. Whatever his feelings, following the little
instructor       s pointed rebuke, he concealed them behind the cool
indifference which marked all of his actions. At the door to headquarters he
turned down the gravel walk that ran in front of the row of huts used as
quarters and was soon lost to sight in the darkness.

McGee       s report of his victory was characteristically laconic. Not a
word did he employ that was not necessary to the report. No fuss, no feathers,
no mock heroics. He had engaged an E.A. (enemy aircraft) and had sent it down in
flames. Reading the report, one would find little enough to lift it out of the
usual run of reports. Another meeting; another victory. No more, no less. Only
in the last paragraph did he depart from his usual method of reporting. He
wrote:

       My Camel carried no ground flares. Twice signaled for landing lights
with no response. Circled field. Entire personnel was gathered around burning
E.A. and making no effort to extinguish fire, which by this time had nearly
consumed plane. Forced to land in dark. Wiped out landing gear and shattered
prop.

       Recommendation: That all commands advise ground crews that a live
pilot is of more importance than a dead enemy.       

Having finished, he looked up at those who had followed him into
headquarters. They were gathered in little groups, excitedly discussing the
victory, which had actually been the first encounter they had witnessed.
Fortunately, the victory had been on their side and they were considerably
bucked. It seemed <a
id='page_98'>98dead easy. Why, one man had gone aloft, bagged a
plane, thwarted the plans of the enemy and was back on the ground before you
could tell about it. The war was looking up! And this instructor was no slouch.
What this squadron wouldn       t do to the enemy when an over-cautious Chief of
Air Service said        Let       s go!       

Hearing their comments, McGee smiled. He knew, better than they, the great
element of luck in his victory.

The enemy, whose aim it had been to thoroughly frighten and subdue this green
squadron, had succeeded instead in greatly increasing their confidence in
themselves. The enemy had come to sow destruction; they had actually planted a
seed that sprang instantly from the ground, bearing the bold and sturdy flower
of self-confidence. Old dogs of war had been unleashed, and now a new pack was
yelping on the trail.

       Where is Major Cowan?        McGee asked.

       Over at the hospital tent,        someone answered.

       Oh, I see. Perhaps it       s just as well. He might not care to sign
a confirmation after reading my recommendation. Which one of you will give me a
confirmation?       

As one man they surged forward.

       Just a minute!        Red laughed.        I said which one. On second
thought I guess I       d better leave that <a
id='page_99'>99to the C.O. First victory from his squadron, you
know.       

       His squadron nothing!        Yancey growled.        You don       t
belong to us       yet.       

       No, but I       m here by assignment; I wouldn       t want to hurt
anyone       s feelings.        He chuckled.        I       m afraid, though,
that the last paragraph in this report has a sort of stinger in it.       

       Let       s see it,        Hampden urged.

McGee handed him the report. Hampden read it, whistled softly and passed it
to Yancey, who read quite as slowly as he talked. A look of disappointment
spread over his face.

       It       s a report, I reckon,        he said slowly,        but
it       s about as satisfyin        as a mess of potato chips would be to a
hungry cowhand. It       s as thin as skimmed milk. Say, who won this fight? You
or the other fellow?       

       I believe that report will give me the credit,        McGee
answered.

       Maybe. And that last paragraph will win somebody a bawlin        out.
Cowan will ask you to change that. Looks like inefficiency on somebody       s
part.       

       Perhaps it is. It goes as it stands. After all, it goes through
channels to the Royal Flying Corps, you know. I       m flying their ship and
still under their orders.       

       Well, when I get my first one,        Yancey replied, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'>100       believe me,
they       ll get the full details, and when they get through readin        it
they       ll think I       m the bimbo what invented flyin       . Those
white-collared babies at Headquarters have to get all their thrills secondhand,
and this thing of yours is about as thrillin        as the minutes of a Sunday
School Meeting.       

At that moment Mullins, the peppery little Operations Officer, entered the
room, his face a mass of wrinkling smiles. He walked over to the desk where
McGee was seated and from his pockets dumped out a double handful of articles,
such as army men had learned to list under the broad
heading              Souvenirs.        There was a wrist watch, a German
automatic pistol, a silver match box, a leather cigarette case, a belt buckle
bearing the famous        Gott Mit Uns        and a number of German paper
marks.

For a moment McGee sat staring at them, then slowly pushed his chair back
from the table as he looked up at the smiling Mullins.

       What       s this       stuff?        he asked.

       Souvenirs, of course! From your latest victory. Cowan and I decided to
go over to the hospital and run through the chap       s pockets to see if we
could find anything that should be sent back to Intelligence. Darned if Siddons
wasn       t there ahead of us, getting ready to fill his pockets with
your souvenirs. I told him to wait until he bagged his own game. So there
you are       cups, belts and badges!       

101McGee gathered
up the articles, one by one, and handed them back to Mullins.

       Take them back,        he ordered, somewhat firmly.

       What!        Mullins        jaw dropped.        You don       t want
       em?       

       No.       

       Not even one       for luck?       

       No. I       ve never carried anything that belonged to the
other fellow, for luck. Take them back.       

Yancey stepped forward, but he was still behind the soft-voiced Edouard
Fouche, who said:

       I       ll take them, then. I       m not so high-minded about
it.       

Tex Yancey pawed Fouche aside as a bear might sweep aside an annoying puppy.
       Out of the way, little fellow. We       ll divide these spoils of
war       or we       ll draw for        em. Everyone to draw straws.       

       Wait!        McGee interposed himself between Mullins, Yancey, and the
indignant Fouche.        If you boys want souvenirs, go out and get them for
yourself. Mullins told Siddons to wait until he bagged his own game. That goes
here, too. Take        em back, Mullins. A man of courage has a right to his
personal belongings       even after he is dead. Take them back and let them be
buried with him. By the way,        he turned back to the desk and picked up his
report,        I want a confirmation from Major Cowan. Where is he?       

102       Oh, I
forgot to tell you,        Mullins replied.        He just jumped in a side car
and went streaking off to Wing, looking like he thought the war had been won.
And he took with him a nice little plum for Intelligence. We found an order in
that pilot       s pocket that should have been left behind.       

       Indeed? What was it?        McGee asked.

       It was in German, of course,        Mullins continued,        and
Cowan is as rotten in German as I am. But Siddons is a shark at it. Speaks half
a dozen languages, you know, and              

       No, I didn       t know,        McGee answered, cryptically.

       Yeah, reads it like English. That order was to the effect that their
high command had received information that several air units were located in
this sector, and ours, in particular, was placed to a T. It was an order for a
bombing group to come over and give us an initiation.        Highly important! Highly
important!        Cowan said, and busted off for Wing. To watch him you       d
think he had brought down the plane. It       s strange, though, how those
square-heads find out every move that is made on this side of the
line.       

       They have a wonderful spy system,        McGee said.        We learned
that well enough up on the English front, where we had reason to feel sure of
the loyalty of every soldier. But the leaks get through. <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>103Cowan was right, the order was highly
important. The Intelligence Department do some clever work with the bits of
information gathered from first one place and another. It       s somewhat like
piecing an old-fashioned pattern quilt. A piece here, a piece there, all
seemingly unrelated but in the end presenting a distinct pattern. Yes,
it       s important, I dare say.       

Mullins sighed, heavily.        Well then, I suppose Cowan will come back
here with a chest on him like a Brigadier!       

Yancey laughed, picked up McGee       s report and handed it to Mullins.
       Read that       especially the last paragraph. When Cowan reads that I
can see his chest droppin        like a toy balloon that meets up with a pin. I
sure want to be hangin        around when it is presented to him. This war has
its compensations. Boys, make yourselves comfortable and await the comin       
of the mighty. It       s worth stayin        up all night to see.       


104CHAPTER VOrders for the Front


3


McGee       s victory had a most salutary effect upon the personnel of the
squadron. They lost sight of the fact that he had been highly favored by luck in
the encounter and that but for luck, coupled with skill, the balance might well
have been in the enemy       s favor. They began to look upon victory as a
luscious fruit that would always be served to their table       defeats were the
bitterberries that the enemy must eat.

This attitude was greatly strengthened by another fortunate victory of a
squadron stationed at Toul. This squadron, while it boasted some splendid
flyers, was quite green and had much to learn. But, despite this, they too had
been victors in their first encounter with the enemy, and in a manner quite as
dramatic as had been McGee       s victory. And it was more widely heralded
because the victor was wearing an American uniform and the victory could be
properly called the first score for the Americans. It came about in this
fashion:

105A Spring day
dawned, cold and foggy, and three members of the squadron at Toul had gone on
patrol. Their ardor was soon dampened by the chill fog and they returned to
their base. Shortly after their return the alert was sounded and the report came
that German planes were coming over, concealed by the ceiling of fog. In a few
moments their motors could be heard above the town. That minute two Americans
left the ground, climbing rapidly toward the ceiling of fog. Just as they neared
it, two German planes came nosing down. They were barely clear of the blinding
fog cloud when they were attacked by the American pilots. So swift was the
attack, and so accurate the fire, that both German planes were forced down and
the two American pilots were back on the ground in less than five minutes from
the time of their take-off.

Luck? Yes, Luck and Skill       the two things that must walk hand in hand
with every war pilot. But there was no one to be found in all of Toul who even
hinted of luck. Had not the fight taken place in full view of the townspeople?
Had they not witnessed the daring and skill of these Americans? Luck? Ask the
citizens of Toul. Ah, mais non, Messieurs! they would tell you. The German
planes dived       so. Whoosh! Out of the cloud they came. And there were those
precious Americans, waiting for them       and in just the right place. Is not
that skill, Monsieur? <a
id='page_106'>106 Then, taka-taka-taka-taka went their guns.
Only a minute so. Voila! The Boche are both out of control. Ah, that is
not luck, Monsieur.

All along the front American squadrons accepted the verdict as evidence of
superior flying ability, but McGee and Larkin, with the knowledge bought by
bitter experience, knew that perhaps in the very next encounter the balance
would be in favor of the other fellow. They knew, too, that over-confidence is
an ally singing a siren song. They worked hard to dispel this over-confidence
that had laid hold of the group, but their words of warning fell on deaf
ears.

This spirit of eager confidence was not peculiar to the air groups near the
front; it was a part of the entire American Expeditionary Force. Where was this
bloomin        war that seemed so difficult to win? asked the American doughboy.
Bring it on! Trot it out! Let       s get it over and get out of this Parlez
vous land. Just give them a crack at Fritz! Say! In no time at all
they       d have Old Bill himself trussed up in chains and carried back to the
little old U.S.A., and exhibited around the country at two-bits a peek. Guess
that wouldn       t be a nifty way to help pay for the war! And as for the Crown
Prince       well, over a hundred thousand American doughboys had promised to
bring his ears back to a hundred thousand sweet-hearts       just a little
souvenir to show what an American could do when he got going.

This same boastful confidence was present among the pilots with whom McGee
and Larkin were daily associated, but fortunately it was somewhat
counterbalanced by the long-delayed orders sending the squadron to the front.
April slipped away and May came. Still no orders. It was maddening! Yancey,
Fouche, Hampden, Hank Porter, Rodd       in fact all members of the command,
save Siddons, fretted and fumed and voiced their opinions of a stupid G.H.Q.,
that failed to appreciate just what a whale of a squadron this was.

Siddons accepted the delay in the same cool, indifferent manner with which he
met all the vexations of the army. It was as water on a duck       s back; he
seemed not to care a hoot whether he ever engaged an enemy. Then in May, with
alarming suddenness and force, the German Crown Prince began his great drive at
Paris. His ears, it seemed, were yet intact, and those Americans who had so
earnestly hoped to get them were soon to discover that the possessor thereof was
all too safely ensconced behind an advancing horde of German infantrymen who
were driving forward in a relentless, unhalting advance that struck terror to
the very heart of war-weary France. In three days the enemy forces swept from
the Aisne southward across the Vesle and the Ourcq. Their <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>108most advanced position came to rest on
the Marne.

For the second time the German army was on the banks of the Marne.
       Papa        Joffre had hurled them back from this river in the first year
of the war; now Marshal Foch must do as well       or France was doomed.

But Foch was handicapped. He had an army bled white by four years of dreadful
warfare. The French soldiers, no less valiant than when the war began, found
themselves too weak in numbers to stem the tide of an advance conducted by an
ambition crazed Crown Prince determined to reach Paris regardless of the cost to
him in human sacrifice.

Sullenly the French fell back, fighting like demons, contesting every inch of
the way, but none the less retreating. In this hour of peril France turned her
eyes upon the newly arrived and partially trained Americans, and in those eyes,
now almost hopeless, was a look of mute, desperate appeal. It must be now or
never!

All the roads leading back from the front were choked with refugees too
weary, too heartbroken, too barren of hope to do anything but hurry their
children before them and strain at their hand drawn, heavy carts piled high with
the household belongings which they hoped to save. Old men, old women, the lame,
the halt, the blind; dogs, cats, goats, with here and there a dogcart, all
struggling to the rear. <a
id='page_109'>109Many came empty-handed, facing they knew not what,
and looking with pity upon the French troops who were moving forward to battle
the enemy unto death.

       Ah,        said the refugees, shrugging their shoulders,
       finis la guerre!These poor Poilus of ours, they cannot stop the
Boche. They are too tired, too worn with war. If only we had new blood. If only
the Americans would come now. But no, perhaps it is now too late.       

Behind them, all too close, rumbled and roared the angry guns       guns of
the enemy furrowing fields and leveling houses and villages; guns of the French
in savage defiance protesting every inch of advance and holding on with a
rapidly failing strength. Help must come now, quickly.

And help came. Two American divisions, ready for action, were summoned by
Foch to move forward with all possible speed. The 2nd Division came hurrying
from their rest billets near Chaumont-en-Vexin, northwest of Paris; the 3rd
Division came thundering by train and camion from Chateau-Villain, southeast of
Paris. Two converging lines of fresh, eager warriors came marching, marching,
the light of battle in their eyes and with rollicking, boisterous songs on their
lips. At quick rout step they came. This was no parade; this was a new giant
coming up to test its strength. And all up and <a
id='page_110'>110down the brown columns the giant was singing as it
came....


       Mademoiselle from
Armentieres,                        Parlez vous,
Mademoiselle from Armentieres,                         Parlez
vous, Mademoiselle from Armentieres Hasn       t been kissed
for forty years,                         Hinkey Dinkey Parlez
vous!        

Slush, slog! Slush, slog! went the heavy hobnailed shoes slithering through
the mud and water of the roads. Mile after mile, hour after hour. At the end of
each weary hour a short rest, an easing of the shoulders from the cutting pack
straps. Ten minutes only did they rest. Then down the long columns rang the
sharp commands,        Fall in. Fall in! ... Com-pan-ee ... Atten-shun! Forward,
March!        A few minutes in cadenced marching and then the command,
       Rout step       March!        Again the confident, boisterous giant took
up its song:


       Good-bye Ma, good-bye Pa,Good-bye mule with your old
he-haw. I may not know what the war       s about But I bet by
Gosh I soon find out! O, my sweetheart, don       t you fear,
I       ll bring you a king for a souvenir. I       ll bring you a Turk,
and the Kaiser too, And that       s about all one feller can
do.        

111Marching,
singing, jesting, they pressed on until their advance guard met the plodding,
cheerless, downcast refugees. The French peasants halted in their tracks,
staring, unable to believe their eyes. Here, in the flesh, by thousands upon
thousands, was the answer to their prayers. Perhaps it was not too late, after
all. Here was new strength, new courage.

Old men danced with joy, embracing their wives and children, embracing one
another, and tears of joy coursed down their wan, lined faces.

       Les Americains!        they shouted.        Vive l       
Amerique! Nous sauveurs sont arrivee!        (The Americans! Long live
America! Our saviors have arrived.)

The cry spread; it ran up and down the roads and bypaths; it became a magic
sentence restoring courage throughout all France.

As for the resolute Americans, they merely plodded on, questioning one
another as to what all the shouting was about. Oh, so that was it? Sure they
were here, but why get excited about it? ... The Boche is breaking through, eh?
As you were, Papa, and keep your shirt on! And as for that old lady over there
by that cart, crying so softly       say! somebody who can parley this language
go over there and tell that old lady not to cry any more. Tell her we       ll
fix it up, toot sweet. O-o-o! La, la! Pipe the pretty mademoiselle over there
driving that dogcart. Ain       t she the pippin though! Say       

112       Fall in!
Fall in!... Com-pan-ee, At-ten-shun! Forward, March!       


       Mademoiselle from
Armentieres,                        Parlez vous.
Mademoiselle from Armentieres...        

A new giant was going in, a giant that did not yet know its own strength, a
somewhat clownish giant, singing as it came.

Those three days of the Crown Prince       s drive on the Marne were dark
days for France. The French people listened eagerly for word from the
front       and prayed as they had never prayed before, while every American
unit, wherever billeted in France, waited impatiently for orders that would send
them in for their first baptism of fire.

McGee and Larkin, though supposed to be instructors and therefore unmoved by
the battle lust that had laid heavy hands on every pilot in France, found
themselves itching for action. They could smell battle afar off; they knew the
need of air supremacy at such a time. On the flying field, and at squadron
headquarters, they tried to cheer up the depressed and sullen pilots who were
chafing under the restraint of inaction. But alone, in the home of Madame
Beauchamp, they freely expressed their feelings.

113       I
can       t see why this squadron is not ordered up,        McGee said to Larkin
one night as they sat alone in their room.        They are better trained than
we were when we hopped across the channel. Remember that day, Buzz?       

       Yes indeed! That was our big day; it       s exactly the same big day
these chaps are waiting for. There must be a great need of planes. I understand
the German Army has crashed through to the Marne. If they pass
there               he shrugged his shoulders expressively.

They sat for a moment in silence, thinking the same gloomy thoughts that were
so staggering to all the people of the allied nations.

       What if the squadron should be sent up?        Larkin asked at last.
       Just where would we get off?       

McGee shook his head.        Don       t know, I       m sure. It       s
strange how we       ve received no word on our applications for repatriation. I
guess we are stuck for the rest of the war. Instructors! Bah! I       m
developing an itch for action.       

       So am I,        Larkin agreed.        When we were first sent back
from the front, I       ll admit I was glad enough to come. I was fed up. But
I       m fed up here now. And what can we do about it?       

       Well, for one thing I can go to bed,        McGee replied yawning.
       To-morrow is another day.        He began unwinding one of his wrapped
puttees.        Ever <a
id='page_114'>114notice how much longer these blasted things are when
you are sleepy?        he asked.

Just as he had finished with one, and had rolled it into a neat ball, a motor
cycle came popping into the yard. Buzz looked at Red inquiringly.

       Wonder what that is?        he asked.

The downstairs front door opened; heavy hobnail shoes sounded on the
stairs.

       Dunno,        McGee answered, looking at the puttee roll in his hand.
       But I       ll wager it       s something that will force me to put this
thing on again. I never got an order from headquarters in my life when I
hadn       t just finished taking off my putts.       

A heavy knock on the door.

       Come in.       

An orderly entered, saluted smartly, and handed McGee a folded paper.
       A note from Major Cowan, sir. He said there would be no
answer.       

       Very well. Thank you, Rawlins. For a moment I thought it might be
orders for the front.       

       No chance, sir. We       re the goats of the air service. The war will
be over before we get a chance. I say they       d as well kept us at home where
we could get real food and sleep in real beds instead of these blasted hay mows
us enlisted men sleep in.       

       Right you are, Rawlins. I       ll speak to the Commanding General
about it to-morrow. In the meantime, carry on, Rawlins.       

115       Yes,
sir.        A smart salute, a stiff about face, and he was gone. They could hear
him grumbling as he went down the stairs.

McGee looked at the folded paper. On it, in Cowan       s hand, was written;
To Lieutenants McGee and Larkin.

       What is it?        Larkin asked, impatiently.

McGee unfolded the sheet. Scrawled across it were these electrifying
words:

       Just finished talking over the phone to Wing. They inform me that
orders have been received approving your application for repatriation. The order
will come down in the morning. Congratulations. Cowan.       

Red slapped Larkin on the back with sufficient force to start him coughing
and then began tousling his hair.

       There, you old killjoy!        he was shouting.        Now stop your
worrying. What do you think of that?       

Larkin began a clownish Highland fling that eloquently spoke his thoughts. At
last he came to rest, snapped his heels together, saluted smartly and said:

       Lieutenant Red McGee, U.S.A., I believe. How do you like
that       you little shrimp?       

       Maybe we       ll be buck privates, for all you know.       

       No, same rank,        Larkin answered.        But believe me,
I       m free to confess now that I       d rather be a buck <span
class='pagenum pncolor'>116in Uncle Sam       s
little old army than a brass hat in any other. Boy, shake!

Sometime after midnight, at least an hour after sleep had at last overcome
McGee       s and Larkin       s joyous excitement, a sleep-shattering motor
cycle again came pop-popping to their door. The dispatch bearer hammered lustily
on the barred front door until admitted by the sleepy-eyed, white robed,
grumbling Madame Beauchamp, and then clattered up the stairs, two steps at a
time. He pounded heavily on the door of the sleeping pilots.

McGee fumbled around on the table at the side of the bed, found the candle
stub, and as the flaring match dispelled the shadows, called,        Come in!
Don       t beat the door down!       

Rawlins fairly burst into the room.        Major Cowan       s compliments,
sir, and he directs you to report to the squadron at once.       

       Good heavens! At this hour? What       s up, Rawlins?       

Rawlins smiled expansively.        Orders for the front, sir. They       re
taking down the hangar tents now, and trucks will be here in the next hour for
baggage and equipment. All the ships are to be on the line, checked and
inspected an hour before dawn. <a
id='page_117'>117The C.O. said to make it snappy. He said a truck
would come after your luggage. It       s a madhouse over at headquarters,
sir.       

Both pilots sprang from the bed.

       Do you know where my orderly sleeps, Rawlins?        McGee asked.

       Yes, sir.       

       Go bounce him out and send him up here, tout suite! Tell Major
Cowan we       ll be over on the double quick. By the way, Rawlins, do you know
where we       re going?       

       No, sir. Secret orders, I understand. But I don       t care a whoop
just so long as it       s to the front.       

       Right you are. Toddle along, Rawlins. Buzz, light that other candle
over there. I can       t even find my shoe by this light.       

An hour later, with all personal equipment packed and ready for the baggage
truck, McGee and Larkin reported to Cowan, who was standing outside
headquarters, issuing orders with the rapidity of a machine gun.

       All set, sir,        McGee said,        and thanks for the note of
congratulations. In the nick of time, wasn       t it? Otherwise we would have
been left behind.       

       I suppose so,        the Major replied.        Fact is, I don       t
know your status now, and I don       t know how to dispose of your case. I
called Wing and was told that your assignment hadn       t come down. The
personnel 118of this
squadron is complete. Here       s a pretty pickle! Guess I       d better pass
the buck and send you back to Wing.       

McGee       s face fell. For once words failed him. He turned his eyes on
Larkin, appealingly.

Larkin entered the breach manfully.        Major Cowan,        he began,
       when we made application to get back under our own flag, we did it hoping
we       d go to the front       not to the rear. This sudden order comes
because pilots are needed. The better trained they are, the better our chances
for victory. I       m not boasting, sir, but McGee and I have been in action.
We can be a help.       

       Yes, yes. Of course. I       d like to have you in my squadron, well
enough, but what about the red tape?       

       Wait until it catches up with us. Don       t go looking for red tape
to fetter us,        Larkin replied.

       Hum-m!        Cowan mused. He knew, none better, that here before him
stood two excellent pilots with a wealth of combat experience. If he sent them
back, doubtless some other squadron would draw them, and that squadron commander
would be the gainer, he the loser. Still, he had no authority for taking them
along. An assignment order would doubtless reach them within twenty-four or
forty-eight hours. Still and all, he considered, much can happen in that
time       especially to an untried squadron going into action. Such pilots as
these were scarce, and many <a
id='page_119'>119were the commanders who would seek them.
       Well,        he said at last,        just what would you do in my
place?       

It was a fair question, and one seldom heard from the lips of a commanding
officer. Coming from Cowan, it was doubly surprising, and effectively blocked
all pleas founded on sentiment and sympathy.

Now Larkin was stumped, but McGee was ready to take up the gage.

       Major Cowan, I have been in the service long enough to know that the
wise army man always gets out from under. Pass the buck. It       s the grand
old game. But I see a way out. If I were in your position I would direct the
issue of an order sending us back. But,        he added as Cowan evidenced
surprise,        I       d manage to have that order mislaid in the
excitement.       

Cowan nervously paced back and forth. Suddenly he wheeled in decision.
       No,        he said,        I won       t pass the buck; I won       t
shift the responsibility. Passing the buck in training may be all very well, but
a commander who does so in action is not fitted for command. We are on the eve
of action. Report to Lieutenant Mullins, gentlemen, and tell him I said you were
to go along. See that your ships are ready at four a.m.        He turned and
walked rapidly toward a group of ground men who were loading a truck.

120Larkin       s
eyes became wide with astonishment.        Well what do you know about that!
Say, that bird is going to make a real C.O.       

       I think he is one now,        McGee answered.        Action does that
to men       sometimes.       


121CHAPTER VIThe Squadron Takes Wing


1


Only a war pilot can visualize the confusion and excitement incident to
moving a squadron base up to the front. There is work enough for all even when
such a move is foreseen and planned for days in advance, but when a moving order
comes down in the dead of night       as is so frequently the case       then
rank is forgotten. Pilots, Commanders, Supply and Operations officers, air
mechanics, flight leaders, in fact everyone, from the C.O. down to the lowliest
greaseball, pitches in with a gusto sufficient to produce a miracle. For it is
little short of the miraculous to carry out an order, received at midnight,
calling for a movement at dawn. In fact, one inexperienced in army ways would
declare that it couldn       t be done. But Great Headquarters considers only
what must be done, issues orders accordingly, and such is the magic of
discipline and proper spirit that lo! the thing is done. The impossible
becomes possible       and the ordinary!

And so it was with Major Cowan       s squadron. The <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>122hour they had so long awaited had come
at last. So great was their zeal that with the first hint of dawn in the east
the planes were all on the field, properly outfitted, finally checked, and ready
to go. Even the planes seemed to be huddled together, poised like vibrant
butterflies, eager to take wing.

McGee and Larkin well knew, from experience, the varied, conflicting emotions
felt by the members of the squadron. Standing near the barren spot where the
large hangar tent had been, they watched the various members making their last
minute preparations. Occasionally they gathered in groups, all talking at once,
and in hurriedly passing one another they would slap each other on the back with
a force greater than needed in friendly greeting. It was the fevered reaction of
nerves! They had waited for this hour, yes, and at last they were going up to
the front; but every man of them knew that some of them would never come back.
There was a grim gateman up there where the guns roared, waiting to take his
toll.

       They think they are going right in,        Larkin said to Red, as he
watched a pilot by the name of Carpenter make the last of at least a dozen
inspections of his two machine guns.        We haven       t the foggiest notion
where we are going, but I       ll wager we won       t see action for several
days.       

       I think you are wrong there,        McGee replied.
       There       s a tremendous push up on the Marne. My <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>123guess would be that we will go somewhere
in the neighborhood of Epernay       probably to take over a sector patrolled by
a French squadron so that they can be used on the more active front around
Chateau-Thierry or up around Rheims. Hullo! There goes the siren and here comes
the Major. We will know soon enough now.       

       I       ll wager you a dinner it       s another soft spot       no
action,        Larkin said.

       Done! You are through with soft spots now.       

Major Cowan       s quick walk spoke volumes. The pilots shouted derisively
at the sound of the siren, a distressingly noisy contrivance designed to arouse
sleepy pilots and turn them out for dawn patrol.

       Fall in! Fall in!        Mullins began shouting.        You act like a
bunch of sheep! Line up there!       

       Call the roll of officers,        Cowan ordered.

A staff sergeant, who had kept his wits sufficiently to rescue the roll from
another headquarters non-com who was packing everything in one of the trucks,
came hurrying forward with the roll. The names were droned off. The
       Here!        that responded to each name was a full commentary on the
mental attitude of the respondent. Yancey, for instance, fairly shouted his,
while Rodd hesitated, seeming to search for an even smaller word.
Carpenter       s        here,        was little more than a whisper, as might
come from one who was making an admission which <a
id='page_124'>124he wished circumstances had ordered otherwise. And
the rotund little McWilliams answered in a manner that convinced McGee that Mac
was really wishing he were not here.

McGee and Larkin, not yet carried on the roll, stood to one side, conscious
of the fact that they were still wearing uniforms of the Royal Flying Corps.
They felt like two lost sheep.

       Look at their faces,        Red whispered to Larkin.        Faces tell
a lot. They       re keen to go, all right, but take Carpenter and McWilliams,
for instance. Scared stiff. They       re expecting to meet an entire Hun Circus
between here and       and wherever we are going.       

The roll call ended.

       Gentlemen,        Major Cowan began, his voice crisp and
business-like,        we have been ordered up to La Ferte sous Jouarre, due
southwest of the Chateau-Thierry salient.       

The exclamation of surprise forced him to pause. McGee gave Larkin a dig in
the ribs.        I win,        he said.        That       s no soft
spot.       

       But,        Major Cowan continued,        for some reason Brigade has
seen fit to divide the journey into two parts. Possibly to permit our trucks to
reach there ahead of us, but more probably because it lacks faith in our ability
to make the change without scattering our ships all along the line of flight.
For my part, I have no such fear. I think I know the ability of <span
class='pagenum pncolor'>125this pursuit
group.        He hesitated, to let this sink in. And it was well that he did.
Yancey gasped, and began coughing to cover it up. Hank Porter stepped on
Hampden       s boot with great force. Hampden in turn nudged Siddons, who alone
of all the group displayed no emotion. Never before had these men heard Cowan
indulge in compliment. Something had come over him. His moustache actually
looked a little more like a man       s moustache. In fact, Yancey
thought, the blasted thing was almost military.

       However,        Cowan continued,        we will fly to a field just
south of Epernay to-day. To-morrow morning we will take off and continue a
course, almost parallel with the present lines, to La Ferte sous Jouarre. Our
destination has been kept confidential until this moment. From necessity, of
course, I have gone over the maps and our course with the flight leaders. They
know the way. In case one of them should be forced down, that flight will double
up with one of the others. You have little to worry about. Keep your head and
remember where you are going. If forced down, proceed to La Ferte sous Jouarre,
on the Paris-Metz road, at the earliest moment. But,        he added, slowly,
       as I said before, I expect to see us arrive there together, and in order.
That is all, gentlemen. Yonder comes the sun. To your ships now, and look sharp
as you take off. Remember, this is no joy-ride. Hold your positions.       

126The pilots broke
into a run for their ships, slapping one another on the shoulder as they
ran.

       Luck, old war horse.       

       Same to you, big feller.       

       Hey, Yancey! If you       re leading B Flight, give her the gun and
high-tail it. The war       s waiting!       

       S       long, Hank. Luck, feller.       

       Get a waddle on, Mac. The war       s lookin        up, eh?       

       I hope to spit in your mess kit.       

Laughing, bantering, shouting, they climbed into their planes. The helpers
stood at the wings, ready to take out the chocks when the motors had warmed; the
mechanics took their places at the props. How envious they were! The little
wasps that they had so carefully groomed were going forward to the battle zone,
and every mechanic offered up prayer that his ship would function perfectly and
make good the hope which Cowan had expressed.

A prop went over, whish! The first motor caught and roared. Another
... another ... bedlam now. No longer any shouting, only a waving of hands, a
few last minute adjustments as the motors warmed and sent a mighty dust cloud
whirling back to obliterate the spot where the hangar had stood.

Straight ahead, a fiery red ball rose over a slate-colored hedge. A long
flight of ravens crossed directly before the rising sun. Huh! Clumsy fellows.
127And slow. Better
come over and take some lessons from some real birds.

Cowan       s plane moved forward slowly, roared into life and fairly sprang
into the fiery eye of the sun. Numbers two and three followed, skimming the dew
drenched grass like swallows over a lake. Then four and five. By George, this
was something like! This was worth waiting for!

The falconer of war had unhooded his new brood of hawks and they mounted up,
free of bells and jesses.

The flight to the airdrome some six kilometers south of Epernay was made
without incident. That is, it was thought to be without incident until Yancey,
leading B Flight, reported to Cowan that Siddons had been forced down by some
trouble over Vitry. Cowan was evidently displeased. He had hoped for a perfect
score.

       What was the matter?        he demanded, the ends of his moustache
twitching nervously.

       Don       t know, sir. He kept droppin        back. I swung alongside
but I couldn       t savvy his signals. He kept pointin        back at his tail.
I couldn       t see anything wrong, but there       s a big        drome at Vitry and
he signaled me that he was goin        down. I hung around to <span
class='pagenum pncolor'>128watch his landin       
and then hustled back to my flight.       

       Fuel up, fly back there and see what       s wrong,        Cowan
ordered.        I       ve a sneaky suspicion that he wasn       t as bad off as
he made out.       

As Yancey turned toward his ship, McGee came up, smiling with pleasure over
the success of the flight.

       Just a minute, Yancey!        Cowan called.        I       ve changed
my mind. You needn       t go back.       

He drew McGee to one side.        Do you remember passing over the French
       drome outside of Vitry?        he asked.

       Yes, sir.       

       Your plane is in good order?       

       Yes, sir.       

       Good. Yancey tells me that Siddons was forced down there. I want you
to refuel, go back there and see what the trouble was. I have my own
ideas.       

       Yes?        McGee queried.

       That fellow hates formation flying like the devil hates holy
water,        Cowan answered.        He       s a joy-rider. He knows how anxious
I am to effect this move without a hitch, and he also knows there       ll be no
passes into Epernay to-night. I       ve a hunch Vitry looked good to him. I
want you to find out.       

       Very well, sir.       

       I       m sending you,        Cowan explained, smiling faintly,
       because it doesn       t make so much difference <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>129if you get lost, since you are merely
       also along       , and also because I don       t expect you to get lost.
Report to me upon your return.       

       Yes, sir.

The mission was not particularly pleasing to McGee. Chasing around after
Siddons was not his idea of a riotous time.

It was some fifty-five kilometers back to Vitry, but with a good tail wind he
made it in quick time. The French major in command of the squadron stationed
there was exceedingly gracious. Yes, the American had landed, he told McGee, but
he had taken off again within the hour. The trouble? Well, he complained that
his rudder was jamming, but the mechanics could not find anything wrong. He had
said, also, that his motor was running too hot. Perhaps, the major suggested,
with an understanding smile, this one had rather fly alone, hein? So many
of them would       and especially by way of Paris, or other good towns. Yes, he
had given his destination       La Ferte sous Jouarre, but is not that on a
direct line for Paris, Monsieur? These youthful ones, would they never learn
that this was a serious business? But no, Monsieur, they are young, and how can
you make one fear discipline who daily faces death? Poof! It was the grave
problem.

130McGee left Vitry
with his own conclusions. So Siddons had pulled a forced landing in order to go
for a joy-ride. Now he was off having a fine time and would claim that his delay
at Vitry was so long that he thought it best to head for La Ferte. Well, they
would have him there. He had not reckoned that Cowan would send someone
back.

Upon McGee       s return to the squadron, Cowan was too busy to see him, nor
did he send for him until after mess that night. When McGee arrived at the
Major       s temporary quarters he found him in company with Mullins, the
Operations officer, and both were bending over a large map spread out on the
table.

Cowan looked up with the quick, exasperated nervousness which he always
displayed when interrupted.

       Well!        he barked, crisply.

       You sent for me, sir?       

       Yes, yes. I had forgotten. What about Siddons?       

McGee had decided to shield Siddons to the extent of not reporting the fact
that the mechanics at Vitry had found nothing wrong with the plane. A squealer
gains no friends in the Army.

       I don       t know where he is, Major. He landed at Vitry, complaining
of a jamming rudder and heating <a
id='page_131'>131engine. He took off again in an hour. He
hasn       t showed up yet. Perhaps he thought it best to go on to La
Ferte.       

       Humph!        Cowan retorted, the pointed ends of his moustache
twitching.        Maybe he did! He needs grounding. I       d send him to
Observation if the Chief of Air hadn       t ordered us to quit using
observation work for punishment. They crack up those crates too fast. And
Siddons is just the kind to do that sort of trick. He       s a good flyer,
certainly, but       what would you do with him, McGee?       

       Oh, I say now              

       Rats! Mullins, how would you handle him? He       s a cold fish, you
know.       

Mullins gulped. He was not accustomed to having Cowan ask his opinion about
anything. However, here was a golden opportunity.

       Cold or hot, I       d let that bird cool off a little more on the
ground. He       s been joy-riding ever since we drew ships. We       ll go into
action soon, don       t you think?       

       Doubtless.       

       Keep him out of the first patrol. He       ll come whining to you and
he       ll sit up and be nice from then on.       

       Hum-m!        Cowan again bent over the maps.

       Anything else, Major?        McGee asked.

       No ... Yes, wait!        he called as McGee reached <span
class='pagenum pncolor'>132the door.        You have
had a lot of combat experience, Lieutenant. I don       t mind telling you that
the load of responsibility gets heavier as we approach action.        He turned
away from the table, walked to the window, and stood gazing out into the utter
blackness of the night.        I wonder,        he mused, his voice subdued,
       if any of you truly appreciate the weight of the
responsibility.       

Mullins glanced at McGee, wonderingly. Both were thinking the same thoughts.
Here was a man, who, until the last forty-eight hours, had always been quite
sufficient unto himself. Now a sudden change had come over him. One of two
things was certain: either he was breaking, and would soon be taken from command
for inefficiency; or he was a strong man indeed, strong enough to admit
weaknesses, unblushingly seek aid, and make use of all available knowledge.

Mullins, in his own mind, decided it was the former; McGee, in his mind, was
confident that it was the latter, and he warmed to him.

       No matter,        Cowan himself made reply to his unanswered question
as he turned from the window with much of his old self-confidence.
       Responsibility is a thing which command imposes       and which I accept.
However, that does not prevent me from profiting by the experience of others, as
I expect to do in your case, McGee.       

133       If I can
help              

       You can. A recent report from General Mitchell declares that
casualties from all causes have been as high as eighty per cent per month in
squadrons at the front. That       s pretty stiff! Fortunately, the General
points out, the enemy losses have been as great, or even greater. I don       t
want to leave a stone unturned that may help us to decrease that percentage in
this pursuit group       and increase it among the enemy! Here, take a
look at this map, McGee.       

He stepped to the table and with a pencil drew a circle around a spot south
of Epernay.        We are here,        he said.        The lines are
here.        He moved the pencil to the northwest of Epernay, where the heavy
black lines indicating the front crossed the Marne.        Notice that the lines
swing southwest through Comblizy and la Chapelle, then northwest again, back to
the Marne, and on to Chateau-Thierry. To-morrow we are to go here.        He
circled a spot just south of La Ferte sous Jouarre.        See anything peculiar
in this situation?        He studied closely the faces of the two junior
officers. Mullins offered no reply.

       I think it peculiar that we have come up here, miles out of our way to
the north, when our destination is considerably southwest of us,        McGee
offered.

       Exactly!        Cowan replied, approvingly.        But there is a
reason for it       to mislead the enemy. Their Intelligence Department seems to
learn of every 134move
we make, and sometimes learns of it in advance of that move. That       s
the real reason we are here.       

       I don       t get it,        Mullins said, shaking his head.

       The order sending us here came down in the regular way,        Cowan
explained,        but the order that takes us to La Ferte, to-morrow morning,
was highly confidential. I did not disclose it until the moment of our
departure, and only then so that anyone forced down would know our destination.
There is to be a considerable concentration of air forces on the apex of the
salient between la Chapelle, this side of Chateau-Thierry, and
Villers-Cotterets, on the other side. It is the beginning of a movement of
concentration to drive the enemy back beyond the Vesle. Hence the secrecy, and
the effort to mislead the enemy as to our movements.       

McGee smiled, somewhat skeptically.

       What       s wrong with that?        Cowan challenged.

       The enemy isn       t so easily misled, Major,        McGee answered.
       We learned that lesson on the English front, and learned it through
bitter experience. If the Hun doesn       t know right now where we are going,
he will know of our arrival twenty-four hours after we get there. If he fails to
foresee our concentration at this point, he is thick-headed and slow-witted
indeed. I, for one, do not consider him slow-witted. About the only secret we
keep from him is the order that is never issued.       

135Cowan frowned.
       I suppose you are right. But how does all this information leak
through?       

       If I knew that, Major, I       d be too valuable to be a pursuit
pilot. If we knew where the leaks were we could plug them by making use of
several good firing squads.       

       You are right,        Cowan agreed, and again bent over the map,
studying it with minutest care.        See here,        he said at last.
       If we flew a true course from here to La Ferte we would parallel the
front for several miles. Here, just south of la Chapelle, we       d be within
three miles of the line. That       s pretty close for a green squadron,
don       t you think?       

       We       ll be closer than that in the next few days       by exactly
three miles!        Mullins answered.        Personally, I       d like to have
a look-see at the jolly old Hun.       

       I don       t think you need worry, Major,        McGee offered.
       It isn       t likely that we will run into any of them, and if we should
we would so outnumber them that they would establish some new records in
high-tailing it home.       

       You think so?        Cowan seemed so unduly disturbed over so remote a
prospect that McGee found himself again doubting the Major       s courage.

       I do. Why, look at our strength! The Boche prefers to have the
numerical superiority on his side.       

       But you       d take up combat formation, of course?       

136       Yes, and
in echelon, one flight above another by a margin of three thousand feet. Then,
if the beggar wants to jump on that sort of buzz saw, let him come       and
welcome.       

       There will be time enough to welcome him when we reach our new
base       all present or accounted for,        Cowan replied.        You have
no objection to flying in the top flight with me to-morrow?       

       Why, no sir. Of course not. I       ll be honored.       

       Bosh! No flattery, Lieutenant. I don       t expect
it       especially from you.       

Seemingly quite exasperated, Cowan turned away, walked quickly to the window
and again stood looking out into the night. Mullins winked at McGee and made a
quivering motion with his hand, indicating that he thought Cowan was suffering
from a case of nerves.

The Major turned from the window and stared at Mullins with a cold, but
studious eye. It made the Operations officer exceedingly uncomfortable.

       You forget, Lieutenant Mullins, that a window facing a dark courtyard
provides a most excellent mirror. Nerves, eh? Well, we shall see. If a commander
seeks counsel, some are likely to think him a fool. If he does not, he
is a fool. When I said to McGee,        no flattery        I meant just that.
Furthermore, I don       t mind telling both of you that I know the regard in
which I am held by some       perhaps all       of <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>137 the members of this squadron. I even
know my nickname,        Old Fuss-Budget       . Humph! A hard master always wins the
name of        old        something or other. I don       t care a hoot about that. I
don       t care a hoot about the opinions of any man in this group if only the
result of their training shows a balance in favor of our country. Am I right or
wrong?       

McGee and Mullins were too surprised to offer reply. This was quite the
longest speech Cowan had ever made in their presence; certainly it was the most
frank.

       Well,        Cowan continued,        I have applied the goad whenever
and wherever I thought it needed. I have been goaded in turn, and took it
without whimpering. I wonder, Lieutenant,        he turned to McGee,        if
you remember the report you made on that Hun you shot down over our
       drome?       

       Why       yes, sir, I do.       

       And the recommendation you tacked on to it?       

       Yes, sir.        Pretty warm, this, McGee thought.

       Then you will recall that it did not reflect any too much credit on
me, as the man responsible for any failure on the part of any member of this
command. But I did not ask you to change the dotting of an I or the crossing of
a T. Nor did you hear a word out of me when I received my bawling out. The army
is like that. From enlisted man to Commanding General, every fellow thinks he is
the only one 138with a
prod in his side. The truth is, the greater the rank, the higher the
responsibility, and the sharper the gaff. I often wish for the quiet, untroubled
mind of a buck private       and I thank Heaven that I am only a Major. Which
reminds me that I am one, and had better cut out conversation and fall to
work.       

His expression changed instantly; he became again the nervous, irascible,
driving commander.

       As for wanting you in the top flight,        he plunged into his quick
manner of speaking,        it is because I want someone there whose eyes are
trained at picking up enemy planes. Doubtless I will get severely reprimanded
for bringing you along, so I had as well get the greatest possible good out of
your experience. You will inform Lieutenant Larkin that he is to go in B Flight,
with Yancey.       

       Very well, sir. But if you really fear any trouble, Larkin will be
more effective in the top flight. Altitude means a lot       and I always feel
safer when he is sticking around close to me.       

       No, I want him with Yancey. We might get separated, and if I draw an
ace for myself, I should give Yancey as good a card.       

McGee smiled at the pun.        Very well, sir, but while speaking of aces,
it       s always best to have        em up. And the higher up the better.
Larkin is a great pilot when he has plenty of altitude       right where a lot
of the others fall down. Take him with you and let me go with Yancey.       

139       Oh, very
well. I started in to ask for advice and I had as well take it. That will be all
to-night, Lieutenant. No, wait! One other thing: Say nothing to anyone about
Siddons going off joy-riding. Let them think he is still at Vitry. I want to
handle him my own way, without stirring up any comment. If they find out he cut
formation on a trumped up hokus-pokus, they would think I should ground
him.       

Mullins        jaw dropped in surprise and astonishment.        Aren       t
you going to ground him?        he asked.

       I am not! I       m going to see that he draws some hot stuff.
I       ve a nice little mission all figured out for him.       

A glint in Cowan       s eyes testified that he was again the self-sufficient
commander, confident of his decisions and determined upon his course of
action.


140CHAPTER VIIVon Herzmann Strikes


1


At dawn the following morning, well behind the
German lines in the vicinity of Roncheres,
Count von Herzmann       s famous Circus was making
feverish haste to take the air. Von Herzmann himself
was coolly instructing the pilots in the purposes
of their coming expedition. His elation was great
indeed, and his entire manner, as well as the pleased
smile that played over his youthful, handsome face,
indicated that he was confident of victory. Confidence,
however, was no new trait in von Herzmann.
He always possessed it, but it stopped just short of
blind egotism. Perhaps therein could be found the
reason for his fame and his success. He was no
blundering, egobefuddled braggart riding for a fall;
he was a splendid pilot, a careful tactician, fearless
when fearlessness was needed and cautious when caution
would bring greater reward than blind valor.
In short, his fame rested securely upon ability. He
was one of the idols of his countrymen, and he was a
scourge both feared and respected by the allied air
141
forces. The ships of his Circus were painted in whatever
gaudy colors proved appealing to the pilots
thereof, but the fuselage of each bore the famous insignia
of the Circus       the defiant German eagle with
its blood red feet and talons supported on a scroll
bearing the legend, Gott Mit Uns. And indeed it did
seem that this Circus was providentially watched
over.

For more than a year the watchword of the French and English had been,
       Get von Herzmann.        It was an easy phrase to coin, but extremely
difficult to execute. Many a French and English pilot had gone gunning for him,
but most of these were now in their graves. Those who escaped were a little less
enthusiastic in their next search for this skilled airman who had run up a total
of more than two score victories.

Von Herzmann, in addition to being a skilled pilot, was as elusive as a
ghost. He was here, there, everywhere. Wherever there was a heavy drive or a
sturdy, sullen defensive, there could be found Count von Herzmann. The Allies,
making use of this knowledge, had sent out many bombing expeditions to blast the
nest of this troublesome Circus from the face of the earth, but their deadly
bombs fell upon deserted, decoy hangars.

As is always the case, those who exhibit a certain degree of excellence find
ready help at the hand of admirers who wish them still further success and
acclaim. 142It was so
in von Herzmann       s case. The German army could ill afford to lose one who
was so brilliant in his operations and so firmly established as one of the
popular national idols. The German Intelligence Department gave him all possible
assistance, thereby not only saving his precious neck but furnishing still more
glamorous stories for a populace that was daily becoming more disheartened and
weary with war.

On this morning at Roncheres, von Herzmann was again preparing to shake
another plum into his lap. Military Intelligence had received word late the
previous evening that an American Pursuit Squadron would on the following
morning leave from a        drome south of Epernay and proceed to a new base south of
La Ferte sous Jouarre. Doubtless they would parallel the line south of la
Chapelle. What could be simpler than to send forth von Herzmann with the full
strength of his justly famous Circus to intercept these untried Americans? Here
was a ripe plum indeed       to be had for the picking!

Von Herzmann was particularly well pleased. He smiled as he climbed jauntily
into his gaudy green and gold Fokker tri-plane. So the stupid Americans had
thought to lead the German High Command astray by such a clumsy movement? Ha!
They forgot that a good spy system is like wheels within wheels. But they would
learn       in time.

143Smiling, he
examined his twin Spandau machine guns. Then he glanced along the line of ships
making up the first flight. Yes, they were ready, awaiting his signal, their
idling motors purring like so many contented cats. The smiling, blond von
Herzmann lifted his hand in signal. The purring sound changed to the deafening
roar of a hundred infuriated jungle cats. The leading plane raced along the
green field, and a moment later the first flight of von Herzmann       s great
Circus leaped into the air, climbed rapidly, and laid a course for a cloud bank
hanging over the lines above Comblizy.

How often the youthful, clever von Herzmann had made use of shielding cloud
banks, or lacking clouds had placed himself above his adversary, squarely in the
blinding sun. One of the two, or both perhaps, would serve him again this
morning.

His smile grew broader as he neared the front. It was thrilling, this hunting
business, and it was made decidedly easier when Intelligence cooperated fully,
as they had done in this instance. He knew the strength of his quarry, their
lack of experience, and the report had included the statement that two of the
planes were piloted by instructors fresh from the English front, flying English
Camels. Two hated Englanders, eh? Gott strafeEngland! He would single
them out and take care of them, one at a time. The rest of his command would
scatter the others like <a
id='page_144'>144 quails, and the survivors, not well acquainted with
the terrain, would have a nice problem in finding their way to La Ferte.
Himmel! but it was a pleasing prospect.

Major Cowan       s squadron had been slightly delayed in starting by two
malfunctioning Nieuports. A precious half hour was spent in correcting the
difficulty and the sun had changed from a dull red ball to a blinding white disk
racing up the eastern sky wall by the time the flights had gained proper
altitude and laid a true course for La Ferte sous Jouarre.

The top flight, with Cowan leading, had climbed to twelve thousand feet. B
Flight, under Yancey, was some three thousand feet under him and somewhat in
advance. This gave the top flight a greater protective power and insured the
bottom flight against any surprise attack. Not only were the flights in echelon,
but the planes of each unit were also echeloned, each plane being slightly above
the one directly ahead. It was a formidable formation, capable of being readily
manoeuvered and with each pilot insured the best possible vision.

A few white, vapory clouds hung high over the trenches toward Comblizy, and
still heavier banks were to be seen to the south of la Chapelle, hanging <span
class='pagenum pncolor'>145over the Surmelin Valley.
In all other directions the sky presented that fathomless blue so well known to
all pilots who ascend above ten thousand feet. The open space between these
apparently unmoving cloud banks was some three or four miles in width.

Larkin, in the top flight with Major Cowan, had taken up position as the
hindermost plane in the group and had, therefore, the greatest altitude. As a
rule, he never was satisfied with his altitude until he had pushed his plane
somewhere near the limit of its climbing ability. He was a splendid pilot at
great altitude, and he had learned from experience that many pilots capable of
doing good work at the lower levels flounder around like fish out of water when
above twelve thousand feet. This being equally true of friend and foe, Larkin
always felt better when he was high enough not to have any worry about someone
coming down on him. He preferred having his enemies below rather than above.

This morning, however, he took no thought of the matter. Before taking off
Major Cowan had said no more than,        Look sharp when we get south of la
Chapelle; head on a pivot, you know.        Shucks! Slim chance for any
excitement with a group like this. Even if they sighted a small enemy patrol
they would have to go merrily on their way and leave the game to someone else.
However, a war pilot with skill enough to become such an ace as Larkin needs
146little caution
about        looking sharp.        It is habit with him, and those who fail to
develop the habit are only a few hours or days removed from sudden disaster.

There was little enough to see. They were flying westward. Again and again
Larkin turned his head around, closed one eye and placing a thumb close to his
open eye squinted into the blinding sun. Many times, by the employment of that
little trick, he had been able to momentarily diffuse the sun       s rays
sufficiently to catch the faintest blurred outline of enemy planes sitting in
the sun and waiting for the proper moment to dive.

This morning the sun seemed unusually bright and blinding. Somewhat ahead,
and to the south, three large French observation planes were coming up toward
the lines at la Chapelle. They were just about even, vertically, with the cloud
bank over the Surmelin Valley. They would pass almost directly under the bottom
flight, led by Yancey.

Larkin watched them, somewhat idly. Photographic mission, probably. Then,
with little or no interest in them, his eye ran along the two converging lines
of planes that made up Yancey       s flight. That moment he noticed
McGee       s plane cut out of position and zoom up at an angle too steep to be
maintained. Then McGee       s plane levelled off and was hurled through a
series of quick acrobatics. It meant but one thing       manoeuver!

147Larkin jerked
his head around and squinted into the sun. Not a thing there       at least
nothing he could see       and as soon as the stabbing streaks of light left his
eyes he glanced toward the cloud bank over the Marne. Nothing there. The three
French observation busses, far below, were going gaily on their way. But McGee
was still climbing and stunting. Larkin knew that this was no idle exhibition.
McGee didn       t fly that way. He was trying to draw their attention to
something.

Larkin looked ahead at Cowan       s plane. That moment the Major dipped his
plane twice. Now what in the world did he mean by that? Larkin wondered. Merely
that he had noticed McGee and was on the alert? Or did he mean that he too had
seen the enemy? Enemy! Where was the enemy?

Again Larkin turned his head to try the sun. Nothing there ... yes, by
George! there was a blur of black spots. But it was such a fleeting view that he
could not be sure, and tried again. Blast the sun! It made him blind as a
bat!

He closed his eyes to cut out the dancing sparks and pin wheels. He opened
them again, and on turning for one more trial at the sun his eye fell upon the
cloud bank to the north. Talk about being blind! Blind as a bat was right!

There, dark, dim and shadowy against the cloud were more German planes than
he had ever before <a
id='page_148'>148seen in one group, and their angle of direction left
no question as to their purpose.

Again he tried the sun. Yes, there they were! No question about it now. They
were coming down, and in so doing were no longer completely within the eye of
the sun. Pretty slick! A group behind to cut off retreat and another group
coming out of the clouds at an angle that would intercept the line of flight.
And that cloud was fairly raining German planes!

       Well!        Larkin exclaimed aloud.        Here       s a
howdy-do!       

The planes to the eastward were looming up with surprising speed, and no one
could say when the ones behind and above would open up their murderous guns.
What would Cowan do? What would any of these green pilots do in such a dog
fight? Larkin looked down at McGee. He was still climbing for all he was worth.
Cowan, if he saw anything, was too paralyzed for action. But perhaps he had not
seen. Air eyes come through experience, Larkin knew, and something must be done
right now.

In the moment that he determined upon a course of action he saw another group
of planes come streaming out of the cloud to the south. Curtains! The whole sky
was full of planes. Then, as they swerved sharply, he saw the sunlight play on
the allied cockade. And how they came! Spads, French Spads! Going up to the
front, perhaps, as a covering flight for the <a
id='page_149'>149observation crates far below. But now they were
swinging into this grand and unexpected melee.

Larkin grinned.        Here is a howdy-do       sure        nuff!        he
repeated and went into a tight, climbing turn that brought him squarely around,
facing the planes streaming down out of the sun. Taps for Mr. Larkin, he
thought, but he would at least give them pause, and by so doing not only provide
Cowan with a chance to wake up and manoeuver, but it would give the oncoming
Spads the one thing they needed       time!

The lightning-like movements and happenings of an aerial dog fight cannot be
followed or seen by any one man. Fortunate indeed is that pilot who can keep
track of what is going on around him. One moment he may have a single adversary;
the next he is the target for two or more planes. If he shakes them off, or by
marksmanship reduces the odds, he may check in for mess that evening; failing to
do so, a squadron commander will that night requisition a new pilot.

As Larkin came around on the quickly executed turn he was only faintly
conscious of the fact that a considerable group of Fokker tri-planes were
sweeping down on him. He gave no thought to the number. His eye was fixed upon a
bright green and gold plane in the lead. As he pulled up the nose of his Camel
and thumbed the trigger release for his first <a
id='page_150'>150burst, he sensed the strange exultation that comes
to that man who, facing death in a forlorn hope and knowing there is no escape,
accepts all chances and sells his life as dearly as possible.

The diving green and gold plane flashed across his ring sights as the Lewis
gun poured forth its first burst. Square into the oncoming plane the tracers
poured. Larkin, seeing that he was on, held his nose up until he knew he was
about to stall.

The green plane dipped, dived under him, and Larkin noticed another plane
flash past him, bent on other game. Then splinters flew from one of his struts
and a bullet smacked against the instrument board.

He had lost flying speed on his zoom to get at the green plane. To regain
speed, and give life to his laboring motor, he dived sharply.

At the beginning of this dive a glance told him that the green plane had
suffered an injury vital enough to cause it to lose all interest in any return
to the attack.

During the first flashing seconds of the attack Larkin       s mind had been
occupied only with the thought of hurling himself at the oncoming planes in the
forlorn hope of diverting their course of action for a few brief but precious
minutes. Suddenly, now, the fleeing green and gold plane awakened memory. Green
and gold! Could that be the plane of the renowned von <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>151Herzmann, who from the beginning of his
fame had advertised himself as the man who always flew a brightly painted green
and gold plane?

Another Fokker dived at Larkin, his Spandaus rattling. His aim was wild and
he overshot Larkin       s steep dive. But in that dive, which brought him all
too close, Larkin caught sight of the insignia on the plane       a German eagle
perched on a lettered scroll. It was von Herzmann       s Circus!

Larkin       s heart leaped. He kicked his left rudder savagely and wheeled
left, thundering after the green and gold plane that was streaking homeward. Get
that plane, get that plane! ran through his mind. All else faded. The presence
of other planes, and his original plan, all were lost sight of in the
pulse-quickening realization that he had crippled the plane of the famous ace in
that first burst. Now to get him and bring him down! Von Herzmann was not one to
cut and run unless there was an urgent reason for it. He was trying to tool a
crippled plane back across the lines. Larkin, determined to make the most of
this golden opportunity, forthwith lost sight of all else.

Ta-ka-ta-ka-ta-ka-ta-ka! Crash! Splinters flew from Larkin       s cowling
and two gashes suddenly appeared in the fabric of his left wing. So! The
crippled eagle had loyal kingbirds for protectors, and they had plunged,
pecking, at the Camel pursuing their leader.

152Larkin dived
clear of the streaming bullets, zoomed upward into a half loop and rolled into
position to fire at the leading attacker. The German was slow and Larkin poured
a stream of lead into the cockpit. He saw the pilot stiffen, as one who has
received a sudden shock or surprise, and then slump down. The plane thundered on
for a moment, then nosed down, out of control.

Ta-ka-ta-ka-ta-ka-ta-ka! Larkin saw tracers zipping past the nose of the
plane. He side-slipped, out of the line of fire, and glanced back. Two more
kingbirds coming to the relief of the fleeing eagle.

Ta-ka-ta-ka       the Spandaus again began their monotonous, metallic
stutter. Into the cockpit of Larkin       s plane streamed a half dozen deadly
pellets. Two of them pinged against the instrument board, another passed
completely through the cockpit, just in front of his stomach. He felt suddenly
cold at the nearness of death as he zoomed steeply into a quivering stall and
slipped off into a spin.

He was conscious of the fact that both the Fokkers were thundering after him.
Then a Camel, with the speed of a thunderbolt, flashed across his line of
vision. He could see the Lewis gun quivering with little excited jumps as it
poured out lead. Good old McGee! He always turned up when needed most.

Larkin neutralized the stick, then ruddered hard left against the spin, and
thus stopped the tail spin. <a
id='page_153'>153Then, gaining speed by a quick dive, he looped with
a suddenness that brought the Camel squarely on the tail of the remaining
pursuer who was diving steeply. Both guns began jumping with delight as Larkin
thumbed the releases. What luck! Square in the ring sight! The telltale tracers
poked their white fingers into the vitals of the Fokker tri-plane. A
serpent-like tongue of red licked out, fluttering for a moment like a wind blown
candle flame, and then leaped afresh in an enveloping burst of flame and
smoke.

Two!

He glanced around. McGee was in a merry game with the other kingbird. Round
and round they plunged in steep spirals, each trying to get a glimpse of the
other across the sights. A tight, breath-taking game, but one which cannot last
long. The circle becomes too small, the pace too swift. It was a game in which,
Larkin knew, the tri-plane Fokker could excel the Camel, granting that the
pilots were of equal skill.

Larkin jockeyed for position, but in that moment when his eye was taken from
the mad game of ring-around-the-rosy, McGee demonstrated that the skill was not
equally placed. The Fokker was now spinning down, obviously out of control, and
McGee was following, filling it with enough lead to sink it. It spun earthward,
sickening in its erratic gyrations.

McGee pulled up on his stick, banked sharply, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>154bringing himself alongside Larkin. They
waved to each other, exultantly. Larkin, who a few minutes ago had decided that
his luck had played out its string, swallowed his heart, murmured
       Whew!        and surveyed the field.

The green and gold plane of von Herzmann was now a rapidly diminishing speck
against the cloud bank toward la Chapelle, streaking for the Fatherland. The
others, lacking a leader, and facing unequal chances with the timely and
unexpected appearance of the French Spads, were withdrawing from the action with
all the speed they could get out of their wonderful motors. And that was speed
enough.

The French Spads had come out of a cloud bank just in time to upset the well
laid plans of the German ace, and that worthy, never expecting such a
dare-devil, self-sacrificing move as made by Larkin, had for once been taken by
surprise. He had been damaged enough to force immediate retirement. The celerity
with which his group abandoned the project and followed in his wake gave glowing
tribute to the true value and leadership of that youth who flew the green and
gold plane. With him as leader, they would have taken a toll, despite the
unexpected arrival of the Spads. But with von Herzmann, their idol and their
pride, forced from the fight by a hated Englander flying a dinky little
Camel       well, the Fatherland could be served some other day.

155But von Herzmann
had been right in his boast that he would scatter the Americans like quails. As
the French Spads pursued the fleeing Fokkers, which were numerically strong
enough to make a too vigorous pursuit unwise and unhealthy, Major Cowan took up
the task of gathering his brood. He flew around, bringing them together,
signaling instructions to take up positions, and pointing westward along the
line of flight. Three of his brood, however, were crushed and crumpled
fledglings on the ground far below. Carpenter, and fat, jolly little McWilliams,
had collided while engaging an enemy. Their crumpled wings had locked fast in an
embrace that spun them down dizzily to a crashing, splintering death. And Nathan
Rodd, he who spared his words, had also been a bit too provident or tardy with
his fire and had been sent down out of control. Cowan had avenged Rodd a second
later, sending his attacker down spinning and thereby gaining his first
victory.

The score, in that far flung encounter, stood one in favor of Cowan       s
squadron, but it was a heavy-hearted group of pilots who at last took up
formation and headed westward. Their faces had a new, grim look. Flying was not
all a matter of shooting the other fellow down. Those who had witnessed the
sickening crash of Carpenter and McWilliams learned at a tragic cost that one
must be all eyes. The gateman, who controls the airways of the skies, was <span
class='pagenum pncolor'>156taking his toll, and
every one of the group that flew westward toward La Ferte, leaving three
comrades behind, now more soberly considered the alarming casualty figures of
eighty per cent per month       and wondered!

A month! It is such a little while.


157CHAPTER VIIIMcGee Makes a Discovery


1


Three nights later, while members of the squadron were engaged in the usual
after mess gab fest, an orderly entered with a summons for McGee and Larkin to
report to Major Cowan. Larkin had just that day secured a misfitting regulation
issue uniform from the Supply Officer, Robinson, and the group had been having a
great deal of fun at his expense. Yancey now saw another chance.

       Old Fuss Budget is goin        to have you shot for
impersonatin        an officer in that scarecrow riggin       ,        he
taunted.        You should have kept your old uniform on, like McGee.       

       Huh! Robinson didn       t have one small enough for McGee,       
Larkin retorted.        They only have men       s sizes in the American Army.
What       s wrong with this uniform?       

       Uniform?        Yancey repeated.        Oh, I thought it was a horse
blanket.       

Larkin thumbed his nose at Yancey as he passed through the door with McGee.
He knew the Major <a
id='page_158'>158would have a long wait if he stayed to get ahead of
Yancey.

Major Cowan appeared to be in an unusually happy frame of mind.

       I       ve good news for you,        he announced as they entered the
headquarters hut.        In losing Carpenter, McWilliams and Rodd, we have
gained you two. And instead of the bawling out I expected, I was congratulated
for unusual foresight. The order assigning you to this squadron will be down
to-morrow. I hope you are as well pleased as I am.       

       Of course we are,        McGee answered for both.        We
wouldn       t feel so much at home anywhere else. I       m sorry, of course,
to come as a replacement for any one of those other chaps. They were fine
fellows.       

       Of course,        Cowan responded, heartily.        Their loss
demonstrates the value of experience. There was no reason at all for the
collision between Carpenter and McWilliams. They simply forgot there was anyone
else in the air. A tough break.       

       Any break is a tough one when you don       t come back,        Larkin
said.

The Major seemed to see him now for the first time.        Where in creation
did you get that gunny sack you       re wearing?        he demanded.

Larkin grinned, foolishly.        From Lieutenant Robinson, sir.       

<a
id='page_159'>159       What       s it supposed to be?       

       A uniform, sir.       

       Thanks. I didn       t know.        He turned to McGee, who still wore
his British uniform.        Didn       t Robinson have any more masquerade
costumes?       

       Not my size, sir.       

       Oh, you go in for size? I see Larkin doesn       t. Why don       t
you get uniforms?       

       We haven       t had a chance, sir,        Larkin answered.
       There is no tailor around here, so I chinned Robinson out of this
enlisted man       s issue. Perhaps,        he offered, smiling,        the
Major will give us a pass to Paris to have uniforms made.       

       The Major will not! We       ve some real work ahead.
But              

The door opened and Siddons entered.

       But don       t put that thing back on in the morning,        Cowan
completed.        Your British uniform is at least presentable.       

       You sent for me, sir?        Siddons spoke from the doorway, his voice
having the quality of one who is extremely bored       especially bored with
being sent for.

       I did.        Cowan       s voice was crisp. The ends of his moustache
began twitching jerkily.        I suppose you wonder why I have said nothing to
you about your failure to rejoin the squadron the other day after you cut out at
Vitry?       

160       Why, no
sir,        Siddons responded, perfectly at ease.        You said that if any of
us developed trouble that delayed us, to come on here at the earliest possible
moment. I was here when you arrived.       

       So you were.        Cowan was making a stern effort to control his
temper.        And it is true that I gave you orders to come on here should
delaying trouble develop. But,        he shot a quick, silencing look at McGee,
       I conducted a little investigation into your landing at Vitry,
Lieutenant, and I discovered that you took off again within an hour.       

Siddons started, almost imperceptibly. His face colored, for a moment, but he
quickly assumed his habitual nonchalance. It goaded Cowan to an inward fury, but
he controlled himself well.

       I suppose you can think of some reason why I shouldn       t ground
you,        Cowan said.

       Why, no sir. No reason at all.       

       Then I can!        the Major snapped.        You like joy-riding, eh?
Like to tour France, eh? Very well, I       m going to give you a bit of it to
do.       

He turned and walked over to a large wall map.        Take a look at
this       all three of you,        he said.        This is a detailed map of
our sector. G2 believes that the Germans are planning to strike north of here,
perhaps just south of Soissons. One of their reasons for this suspicion is that
information has reached G2 to the effect that Count von Herzmann       s Circus
has 161pulled out from
Roncheres. Where is he now? That       s the question! The Intelligence sharks
at Great Headquarters believe that if we can locate his new base we will know
something more about the plans of the enemy. As a result, every squadron along
this front has been ordered to make an effort to locate his new position.
Personally, I am of the opinion that Larkin winged him the other morning, and as
a result his Circus has been withdrawn, pending his recovery.       

Larkin shook his head regretfully.        I wish I could think so, Major.
I       d like to boast that I had given von Herzmann a little lead poisoning.
But I don       t think so. The tracers showed that my burst was going into his
motor. I winged that, all right, but he didn       t fly like a wounded
man.       

       Modest enough,        Cowan approved.        It seems that G2 thinks
the same thing. They have reason to believe that he is in the neighborhood of
this point here,              he put a finger on the map              where the
railroad between Soissons and Chateau-Thierry crosses the Ourcq.       

He turned now directly to Siddons, his eyes cold and piercing.
       Lieutenant Siddons, you seem to be a most excellent map flyer. You find
your way here alone, and you tour this part of France with admirable ease.
To-morrow morning, if the visibility is good, you will take off at dawn, cross
the line above Bouresches, push on toward Bonnes and as far inland <span
class='pagenum pncolor'>162as the railroad crossing
on the Ourcq       if possible. Is that clear?       

       Perfectly, sir.        Siddons was as unconcerned and unruffled as
though he had received an order to fly to Paris.

       You will get the greatest possible altitude before crossing the line,
and you are to avoid combat. Your mission is to bring us information, if
possible, concerning the location of enemy        dromes       and especially von
Herzmann       s base. Am I clear?       

       Perfectly, sir.       

One could not but admire the cool confidence of the fellow. His complacency
was not what Cowan had expected.

       If you think the risk is too great, alone,        Cowan said, after
watching his face for any hint of quailing,        I will send two other planes
with you. They might help reduce the odds in case of unavoidable
combat.       

       Oh, that       s not necessary,        Siddons replied.        In
fact, one plane has a better chance to escape combat, especially if there are
some clouds to duck into. Anything else, sir?       

Cowan made a clicking sound with his tongue. The fellow wasn       t human;
he was an iceberg!

       That is all. And I wish you luck.       

       Thank you, Major. And thanks for the mission.        He gave McGee and
Larkin the pitying look of one who has just drawn the grand prize in an open
competition, 163and
without another word turned quickly and passed through the door.

Cowan       s face had a baffled look.        Well,        he finally said,
       he acts like a gamecock, anyhow.       

       Do you realize the danger of the mission?        McGee asked.

       It       s not for me to consider that angle,        the Major
replied.        G2 wants information, and I am under orders to help supply it.
Danger? Yes. That       s war. If we lose       well, I       d rather not
discuss it.       

At that moment the door opened. There, framed against the night, stood Nathan
Rodd! In salute he brought a gauze-wrapped hand to his head, a head so thickly
swathed in bandages that only his face was showing and his service cap sat
perched at a ridiculous angle.

       Lieutenant Rodd reports for duty, sir,        he said.

Cowan, McGee and Larkin had stood transfixed, as men might who thought they
were seeing a ghost. But Rodd       s words, concise and strikingly
characteristic of the taciturn Vermonter, snapped them into action. This was no
ghost!

       Rodd!        Major Cowan exclaimed, and rushed across the room to grip
Rodd       s unbandaged left hand.        You here?       

Rodd considered it unnecessary to waste words on so stupid a question. He
merely offered his hand, when the Major released it, to McGee and Larkin, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'>164who were pounding him on
the back in great glee.

       We thought you were dead,        Cowan said.

       So did I       until I woke up,        Rodd answered.

Cowan, noting the pallor of his face, pressed him into a chair.        Tell
us about it,        he urged.        Were you badly hurt? What happened?
Didn       t you crack up              

Rodd lifted his good hand in protest.        One question at a time, Major.
That German found my motor and it conked. I regained control just in time to
level off, but not in time to miss a tree. After that I don       t know what
happened. Came to, flat on my back, fifty feet away from my plane. It was
burning. That       s all there is to it.       

       All there is to it!        Cowan snorted.        You       re not
sending a telegram. Words won       t cost you anything. Where have you been
since then?       

       Hospital. Waiting for a chance to skip out.       

       You mean       you ran away from the hospital?       

Rodd nodded.

       You are crazy, man! Why did you leave?       

       I don       t like hospitals.       

       But you are hurt! Is your head badly injured?       

       Cut.       

       And your hand?       

       Cut.       

Cowan could not escape laughing. McGee and Larkin joined in.

165       I       m
not laughing at your injury, Lieutenant,        Cowan explained,        but at
your way of telling it. If that should happen to Yancey he       d write a book
about it. Of course, I       m delighted to see you alive. I had the good
fortune to wipe out the one that shot you down. He went down
spinning.       

       See him crash?        Rodd asked.

       No. Things were pretty thick. I didn       t have time to
watch.       

       Didn       t kill him,        Rodd announced.

       What!       

       He made a better landing than I did. He was trying to bring me to when
some Frenchies came running up and nabbed him. Decent fellow. The Frenchies
treated him pretty rough. Put the screws to him, I guess.       

       See here,        Cowan leaned forward in his chair,        either tell
all this story, or back you go to the hospital. You say the French questioned
him?       

       French Intelligence did. Pretty game fellow, they said.       

       But he talked?       

       Had to. That was von Herzmann       s Circus.       

       We know that. Anything else?       

       Yes. He said they knew all about our plans, and were out gunning for
us.       

Cowan       s face colored, but with confusion more than anger.

166       Anything
else?        he asked crisply.

       Well       the Frogs found out something else, but,        he cast a
quick, furtive glance at McGee and Larkin,        but I guess I       ve talked
enough. Someone is talking too much, that       s certain.       

Cowan had seen the glance, and the inference irritated him.        These
officers have proved their loyalty by service, Lieutenant.       

       Yes, sir,        was Rodd       s meatless reply.

McGee felt genuinely hurt, but at the same time he recognized the fact that
Rodd       s statement was all too true.

       Rodd is quite right, Major,        he said, and arose from his chair.
       If he has any real information, it belongs to you alone       or to G2.
If you       ve nothing further, Larkin and I will be going.       

       No, nothing further.       

       No orders for to-morrow morning?       

       No.       

       May I speak to you a moment       privately?       

       Certainly.       

They moved over near the door.

       You gave Siddons a mission I would like to have, Major. Any objections
if I take a little joy-ride in the morning?       

Cowan       s eyes narrowed.        Where?        he asked.

       Over the lines. I       d like to do a little looking for
myself.       

167       With
Larkin?       

       No, sir. Alone. Don       t even want Larkin to know I       m going.
I think I know where to locate von Herzmann       s Circus.       

       What are you driving at, Lieutenant?       

       Major, if I told you half of what I think I know, you       d call me
crazy.       

       Hm-m! Well, I can       t give you permission to go       but I will
not be looking for you before noon.        His sly wink told Red all that he
wanted to know.

       Yes, sir. Good night, Major. Good night, Rodd. The gang will be mighty
glad to see you back, old hoss! Come on, Buzz, let       s go to bed.       

Outside the door Larkin       s fuming rage exploded.        Say, what did
that tongue-tied sap Rodd mean by that dirty dig? If his head wasn       t
already in a sling, I       d              

       Calm yourself, brother!        Red laughed.        If you had landed
on your head from as high a point as he did, and then found out it was all
brought about through a leak, you       d be suspicious of everyone
too.       

       Maybe so,        Larkin answered, somewhat mollified.        What were
you buzzing old Fuss Budget about?       

       I       ll tell you that to-morrow night       maybe.       

       Humph!        Larkin snorted.        I guess Rodd       s disease is
catching. You       re tongue-tied too!       

Without reply Red led the way across the flying <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>168field to their hut. Entering, he began
fumbling around in the dark for a candle stub. Larkin took up the search, by the
aid of flickering matches, but the candle was nowhere to be found.

       It       s a fine war!        Larkin growled, as he began undressing
in the dark.        All the letters from the States bear the postmark,        Food
Will Win The War.        I guess the Army is trying to save on candles,
too.

Before sunup the following morning McGee awoke and began quietly dressing. He
did not want to awaken Larkin. When he had finished dressing he tiptoed
cautiously across the floor, opened the creaking door ever so slowly and closed
it with the same care.

Dawn was just streaking the east. A few birds were offering their first
roundelays; the grass and trees were wet with a light rain that had fallen
during the night, and to the northeast the distant guns were rumbling their
morning song of hate       evil dispositioned giants, guttural in their wrath
when dawn awoke them to a new day of devastation. Two or three sleepy-eyed air
mechanics were making their way toward the hangars.

McGee stood for a moment outside the hut, studying the sky, which was a
patchwork of clouds scattered <a
id='page_169'>169across grey splotches that would turn to blue with
the coming of the sun. Evidently the sky had been quite overcast during the
night, but the clouds were broken now, though by no means dispersed.

It was an ideal morning for crossing the lines. Convenient cloud banks were
excellent havens in case of surprise, and Archie fire was less accurate when the
gunners had to contend with a ship that plunged into concealing clouds and out
again at the most unexpected places. Of course, those same clouds offered
concealment for enemy planes, but a pilot crossing the lines alone is
considerably advantaged by such a sky as McGee was now studying approvingly.

As McGee started toward the hangars he saw that some of the ground crew were
wheeling out Siddons        Nieuport. Well, the Major had stuck to his
resolution and the order had gone through.

       Where       s Lieutenant Siddons going?        McGee asked the Ack
Emma who was making a careful check of the plane.

       Don       t know, sir. Got orders last night to have her
ready.       

       Did Sergeant Williams get orders for my plane?       

       Yes, sir. Are you and Siddons goin        over on patrol,
Lieutenant?       

       I can       t answer for Siddons,        McGee evaded.
       You       d better ask him.       

       Huh! A lot of good it would do. Honest, Lieutenant, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'>170that fellow talks less to
us than a cigar store Indian talks to the customers       and that       s less
than nothin       . He thinks we       re worms!       

McGee was about to offer his sympathies when another crew, under Sergeant
Williams, came rolling the Camel out to the line. McGee began checking it over
with the same minute care which had doubtless gone a long way toward making him
an ace. He left inspection to no man. His air mechanic, knowing this, was
equally careful in his work. This diminutive lieutenant was as mild as an April
morning so long as all was well, but when something went wrong he could say more
than a six foot Major-General.

       All set, Sergeant?        McGee asked, finishing his inspection.

       All set, sir. I just put a new valve in that wind driven gas pump. The
guy that invented that trick should have been tapped for the simples. Why
don       t you hang this thing on a church steeple, Lieutenant, and get one of
those Spads?       

       Well, I rather dislike entering a church from the steeple, and
I       m sort of partial to this old crate. She       s tricky on the ground,
but I       m used to her ways and she       s a Lulu upstairs.       

He swung into the cockpit and the Sergeant stood at the prop.

       Switch off?       

       Switch off!       

171The sergeant
pulled over the propeller two times.

       Contact, sir.       

       Contact.       

The motor caught, and after it had idled a few minutes McGee began revving it
up.

Just then he noticed Siddons come from around the corner of the hangar,
carrying what appeared to be a canvas covered pillow. Seeing McGee       s plane
on the line he stopped in surprise, then proceeded to his plane, where he fitted
the pillow into the seat, patting it in place as a woman pats a divan pillow.
Then he came across to the side of McGee       s plane.

       Did you get orders, too?        he shouted.

McGee cut the gun.        No,        he answered truthfully. Satisfied that
this would not end the questioning, he added,        The Ack Emma has made some
repairs. I       m going to give her a test.       

       Oh, I see. Thought maybe I was going to have the pleasure of your
company       and your help. Nice morning for my little jaunt, isn       t
it?       

       Bully!        McGee looked at him closely to discover any hint of
fear. It simply wasn       t there, and Red was forced to the mental admission
that he had never seen such a cool, confident manner displayed by any pilot
going over for the first time.        Good luck!        he called, and again
began revving his motor.

Siddons turned back to his own plane, and with the most casual inspection,
and with no comment to <a
id='page_172'>172the mechanic, crawled into his cushion padded
seat.

McGee, satisfied with the sound of his own motor, nodded to the wing boys to
remove the chocks, and taxied to a quick take-off. At two or three hundred feet
he turned, came back across the        drome and headed in the general direction of
Paris, climbing steadily and maintaining the direction until to the watching
ground crew he became lost to view.

Then McGee swung north and began working back eastward. He passed to the west
of La Ferte, and having gained an altitude of fifteen thousand feet, headed
directly for the front, intending to cross the line to the north of Belleau and
proceed toward Fere-en-Tardenois. Then, if fortune favored him, he could decide
upon a deeper thrust into enemy territory.

The cloud strata was exceptionally deep and yet ragged enough to provide
frequent glimpses at the world below. The one great danger lay in the fact that
he might any minute come unexpectedly upon a German pursuit group. It was
probable, however, that on such a morning they would be operating at a lesser
altitude.

The trenches, as he crossed the line, were only faintly discernible, the
detail obscured by the blue ground haze so common to the eyes of the pilot
operating at high altitudes. But the strip of barren land on each side of the
trenches gave visible evidence of the grimness of the struggle far below, and
here 173and there
along the line, miniature geysers spouted fan-shaped eruptions of earth with a
grotesque, unexpected suddenness. Then a second later a new pock-mark on the
face of an already over-tortured earth showed where the shell had exploded.

It was fascinating to watch. Nerve-racking and ear-splitting as it must be to
the mud-splashed creatures in the trenches below, from on high the land within
the neighborhood of the zig-zag trenches took on the appearance of a pot of
boiling mush       here a crater, there a crater, springing into being with an
amazing suddenness that lured the observer into the game of guessing when the
next crater would appear.

McGee was engaged in exactly such mental speculation when he was brought to
the realization of his own nearness to war by the plane-rocking explosion of a
well-placed Archie. Then two other giant black roses bloomed directly in his
path. Now he was presented with his own guessing game. Where would the next one
be?

He swerved sharply left and dived toward a neighboring cloud. A cloud, while
seeming from below to have both form and substance, is in reality but little
different from a dense ground fog. It is enveloping, misty, eerie, and cuts off
all visible contact with the world. If it covers a large air area, then the
pilot may face some nice problems in correct and stable navigation, but if it is
only a patch, he drives straight <a
id='page_174'>174along his course, knowing that he will plunge out
into the sunlight with the same suddenness with which he left it. Clouds are
particularly welcome when Archie gunners begin to plaster the air with high
explosive shells.

As McGee came out of this cloud, his attention was drawn to a number of black
bursts some three thousand feet below, but which clustered around a lone
Nieuport flying at a forty-five degree angle to the line of flight which McGee
was pursuing. That Archie crew knew their business, and McGee thought they
appeared uncomfortably near the Nieuport. Then, as he watched, the Nieuport did
a strange thing. Instead of making a sudden change in direction or a quick dive,
either of which would compel the gunner to make another quick calculation in his
range, it merely rolled once, then dipped twice, and proceeded on its way. The
Archie fire ceased as suddenly as it had commenced.

McGee streaked across another open patch of sky and entered another cloud.
Coming out of this one he again spotted the lone Nieuport and corrected his own
line to correspond with that of the lone flyer below. Now, studying it more
closely, and with more time, he felt sure that it was Siddons        plane. One
thing certain, the red, white and blue cockades established it as an American
manned plane, and who, save a novice, McGee reasoned, would roll and make a
175slight dip to
escape Archie fire. That particular battery must have been too convulsed by
laughter to continue their fire. Had that stupid pilot, whoever he was,
forgotten what he had been told concerning Archie fire?

With the same surprising suddenness with which Archies always proclaim their
presence, three more black puff balls inked the air directly ahead of the
Nieuport. They were off the mark, but they furnished data for other guns which
began filling the air. Evidently the gunners had not yet seen McGee, who was
much higher and considerably behind the Nieuport, for they were concentrating on
that plane.

To McGee       s surprise the Nieuport again rolled, then dipped twice, and
the guns below immediately ceased firing. McGee decided it was time to seek the
seclusion of a nearby cloud and while driving through it, do a little
thinking.

What he had just witnessed was enough to make any experienced pilot think.
Someone, flying a Nieuport, had a most novel way of treating with anti-aircraft
gunners. He merely rolled over, straightened out, dipped twice, and the guns
promptly left off their quarreling. No one could be stupid enough to reason that
such manoeuver would discomfit the gunners, and yet in this case the effect was
more efficacious than any manoeuver yet invented.

McGee smiled at the stupidity of the thought. It <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>176was effective only because it was a
signal, prearranged and understood by the anti-aircraft gunners. The pilot of
that Nieuport was in communication with the enemy, and McGee believed that man
to be Siddons!

It all came to him in a flash. Who, better than Siddons, could have supplied
the enemy with the information that brought them over to bomb the green squadron
when they were stationed near Is-Sur-Tille? Someone supplied it, for Cowan had
found in the pocket of the German flyer whom he, McGee, had brought down, an
order disclosing the very fact that the raid had been planned on Intelligence
reports. And where had Siddons gone that day after landing at Vitry on the
slenderest excuse? The French Major said he had taken off within an hour. And
the very next morning the squadron stumbled into a net spread by von Herzmann,
and but for the timely and unexpected arrival of a large group of French Spads
the harvest would have been great indeed. Could it be that Siddons had crossed
the lines the previous afternoon, escaping Archie fire by a simple code of air
signals, and disclosed the entire plan to the enemy?

McGee felt a hot wave of ungovernable anger sweep over him. He no longer had
any doubts whatsoever. Two and two make four. Siddons was a traitor to his
country. To his country? No, doubtless he was one of the many who had been
trained for years <a
id='page_177'>177against this very hour of need. On false records he
had gained admission to the American Air Force, and now       

McGee came out of the cloud into the clear sunlight, and began searching the
sky for the Nieuport. It was not to be seen. He flew on, encountered other
clouds, came out again, but the Nieuport had miraculously disappeared.

McGee flew steadily northeast until he spotted an exceptionally large group
of enemy planes, working up from the direction in which he was headed.

It was time to turn around. He was quite too far into enemy territory to feel
comfortable, and that swarm of planes made him unusually homesick, even though
they were far below him.

But just as he banked into a left turn he noticed that they were nosing down,
sharply. He flew along the misty edge of a cloud, watching closely. Down, down,
they went, becoming mere specks against the blue-grey ground haze.

They were about to make a landing! There could be no doubt of it, though at
this distance and altitude he could not make out their hangars. On down they
dropped, until at last they seemed to be engulfed by a greyish sea that shut out
all definite form.

McGee had come for information, and here it was within his grasp if he were
only willing to take a chance.

178The strata of
clouds against which he was flying stretched in the general direction of the
place where he had lost sight of the large flight of planes.

He ducked into the clouds and drove along until he estimated that he was
somewhere in the right neighborhood.

Coming out into an open sky he located a considerable forest far to his right
and another one several kilometers directly ahead. Directly between these a
ribbon of white marked its twisting course. That would be the Ourcq, and the
forest beyond would be the Forest de Nesles. And       yes, there just beyond
the river was a town       which McGee concluded must be
Fere-en-Tardenois       and a little way from its outskirts a group of drab
square blocks that caught and held his eyes.

Too much ground haze to make them out. Well, a chance is a chance, he
reasoned, as over went the Camel       s nose in a long dive.

Twice he checked the dive, only to dive again. He hated to give up altitude,
but he was determined to get a look.

After the third dive, and the loss of several thousand feet, he made out the
drab-colored canvas hangars of a German        drome, and poised on the open field was
a veritable swarm of little moths appearing to be drying their wings in the sun.
Three of them began racing along the ground and bounded into the <span
class='pagenum pncolor'>179air. At the same minute
an Archie battery opened from the town. The burst was wide of McGee       s
plane, but there was no mistaking their sincerity nor the fact that those three
harmless appearing moths below were climbing to the attack.

Red gave his Camel all he thought it could stand as he climbed for the
protecting clouds. Information was of no value if sealed by a dead man       s
lips. He had learned far too much this morning to chance any fight with anyone
that could possibly be avoided.

The Archie fire continued until he had regained the clouds, and even then two
or three more shells burst harmlessly somewhere ahead in the grey mist wall. He
changed his direction sharply and roared along on a full throttle.

His heart was racing with his motor. He felt convinced that the        drome he had
located was a new base for the squadron he had just seen, for were they not
coming up from the interior? Doubtless he had stumbled on to a movement of some
importance. Just how important he could not know, but G2 would be delighted with
such information. Could that squadron, he wondered, by rare good fortune be the
Circus of the famed von Herzmann?

Over Etrepilly an Archie battery hurled aloft a smashing, plane-staggering
burst of black puff balls. A jagged piece of steel tore through his left wing.
Too close, that!

180He dived
steeply. More shells burst above him. Above, but still uncomfortably close.
Those gunners were real marksmen.

Suddenly he thought of what he had seen the lone Nieuport do. It might be
worth trying. Acting on the impulse he rolled, straightened out, then dipped
twice. One more shell came screaming aloft and then the batteries became
abruptly silent.

Well, that was that! There could be no question now as to the movement being
a prearranged signal. Archie gunners would not ordinarily leave off firing at
any such stupid performance       they would chuckle while they locked the
breach on another shell, and forthwith blow that fellow into Kingdom Come.

McGee was in high fettle as he streaked across the lines south of Belleau and
laid a course for home. He had a great deal to report, and someone, flying a
lone Nieuport, was going to have a great deal of explaining to do.

When McGee swooped low over his own hangar, preparatory to a landing, he was
surprised to see Siddons        Nieuport resting on the tarmac. So he was back
so soon!

Larkin was the first to greet McGee when he crawled from his plane.

<a
id='page_181'>181       Where       ve you been?        he
demanded.

       Oh, just up for a little test,        McGee replied, assuming an air
of indifference.

Larkin pointed to the jagged hole through the fabric of the left wing.

       Don       t kid me!        he said.        Where       d you pick up
that little souvenir?       

       I       ll tell you later,        McGee answered and started toward
the Major       s headquarters.

Larkin seized his arm and spun him around.        You       ll tell me one
thing right now, little feller! What       s so funny about hiding my uniform so
I       ll get bawled out again by Old Fuss Budget for wearing this
misfit?       

McGee looked at him blankly.

       What do you mean?       

       Mean? I mean you got up so early a respectable milkman wouldn       t
think of being up, and with your brain a bit foggy you thought what a clever
idea it would be to hide my English uniform and give this gang of Indians
another day of pleasure. What       s the big idea?       

McGee shook his head.        I never touched your uniform, Buzz. Come to
think of it, though, I don       t remember seeing it this morning while I was
dressing. Did you see it last night?       

       See it last night!        Larkin snorted.        How could I? We
couldn       t find the candle and it was so blasted dark <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>182that I hung my shoes on a chair and my
pants on the floor. Quit foolin       , Red. Where       s that
uniform?       

       I don       t know, I tell you. But if I were you I       d go ask
Yancey that question.       

Larkin       s eyes snapped.        That       s the bozo! That Texas
longhorn is just before meeting up with a real cyclone.       

       Better go easy,        Red warned.        He       s used to cyclones,
and I       ve always had a sort of feeling that he could take care of himself
in heavy weather.       

Nothing daunted, Buzz went bowling off in search of Yancey, and McGee crossed
the        drome to Cowan       s headquarters.

The excited enthusiasm with which McGee began his report to Cowan was quickly
cooled by the Major       s expressionless indifference. Throughout
McGee       s narration of the events of the morning, Cowan continued studying a
sheaf of papers lying on the desk before him, now and then penciling thereon
some memorandum or brief endorsement. That part of the report dealing with the
actions of the lone Nieuport, which seemed to have a system of signals to insure
safe passage over the lines, brought from the Major no more than a throaty,
       Hum-m.        It angered McGee, and brought from him a heated charge
which under other conditions he would have hesitated to make.

       And the man who was piloting that plane is a member of this
squadron,        he blurted out.

183Cowan casually
turned a sheet of paper.        Indeed,        he replied, continuing his
reading. It was maddening.

       Has Siddons reported to you, sir?        McGee asked, pointedly.

       Yes.        Cowan arose and looked straight at the flushed young
pilot. His eyes were uncommunicative.        Lieutenant Siddons just left here
with Colonel Watts, going back to Wing headquarters,        he said.        I
may tell you, Lieutenant, that the Colonel came down a short time after Siddons
hopped off, and gave me a most uncomfortable half hour for sending him over. We
will discuss it no further, and I charge you with absolute silence in the
matter. You are to say nothing, to anyone, concerning this entire matter. You
understand?       

       I understand that I       m to keep silent, sir       but I
don       t understand the rest of it.       

       It isn       t necessary that you do. That is all,
Lieutenant.       

       But what about that        drome I located at Fere-en-Tardenois? I think it
is Count von Herzmann       s Cir              

       You think wrong, McGee, but whatever you think, don       t think out
loud. That is all, Lieutenant.       

       Yes, sir. And there are no orders for              

       Orders will be a little more secret       in the future.       
Cowan       s voice was crisp, and carried a note of dismissal.

184       Yes,
sir.        McGee saluted stiffly, turned on his heel and walked from the room,
steaming with anger. Outside the door he picked up a small stone from the newly
graveled walk and hurled it singing through the top of a nearby poplar. He
simply had to throw something.

       You poor prune!        he addressed himself.        You never did have
enough sense to know when you were well off.       


185CHAPTER IXLady Luck Deserts


1


There followed three days of maddening inactivity, during which time the
squadron fretted and became as edgy as so many caged tigers. McGee made use of
the time by securing a trim fitting uniform, the very sight of which threw
Larkin into new outbursts of rage concerning the disappearance of his English
uniform. A joke was a joke, when not carried too far, he argued, and admitted
that he was exceedingly weary with the comments made concerning the fit of the
issue uniform that he was compelled to wear. Every man professed innocence, but
Larkin did not believe a word of their stout denials. The manner in which he
took the joke was evidence of the irritability caused by the days of inaction.
Every member of the squadron was looking for something over which they could
quarrel.

Then one night, about nine o       clock, orders came down for a dawn patrol
of two flights of five ships each.

Cowan summoned McGee and Larkin to his headquarters <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>186and gave them leadership of the flights.
McGee protested, pointing out that he did not want to gain the honor at
Yancey       s expense, and particularly since he considered Yancey worthy of
the command. But Cowan was sure of the wisdom of the move, and made his own
selection of the men who were to go on this first patrol.

The posting of those names on the bulletin board brought shouts of delight
from the lucky ones and growls of disgust from those who were not selected.

Even Nathan Rodd, still wearing bandages on his head and right hand, broke
his silence and wolfed loudly over the fact that he had been left out.

       Aw, dry up!        some other unfortunate pilot growled at him.
       You       re still seein        stars from that last crack you got on the
head. What do you want       all the luck?       

It was an expression peculiarly fitting to the situation. Some of the names
on that bulletin board might next appear in the casualty reports, yet every man
wanted his name on the board, firm in the belief that death would somehow pass
him by.

In McGee       s flight appeared the names of Tex Yancey, Hank Porter,
Randolph Hampden, and of all luck       Siddons!

McGee started to make protest, thought better of it, and biting his lips
savagely left the group around the board and went to his quarters. Of all the
good men 187in the
squadron, why should that traitorous scoundrel be included and other loyal
deserving pilots be left behind? Someone was being pig-headed indeed!


2


Along about two o       clock in the morning the eager pilots, tossing on
their beds in a sleeplessness induced by the promise of the coming of dawn, were
more fully awakened by the deep and sullen thundering of thousands of big guns
hammering at the lines. It was no fitful, momentary outburst; it was the
constant earth-shaking roar that presages a drive. To the north and east the sky
flickered with the light coming from thousands of cannon mouths. It was like the
coming of a summer storm when the thunder god growls his wrath and lightning
plays constantly over the giant thunderheads.

There could be no sleep now for the anxious pilots. Something had popped
loose up there, and in a few more hours they would be on their way up to witness
this far-flung duel.

The flickering, flashing light of cannon fire faded at last before the salmon
and rose colored morning light that streaked the smoke clouds lying across the
pathway of the coming sun. Long before that orb of light arose, red-eyed, over a
new scene of carnage, ten planes were out on the line, motors warming, while
188the pilots and
mechanics made last minute inspections. Every member of the squadron was
present; the unlucky ones to bid good luck to those chosen for the mission and
to see the take-off of this first dawn patrol. Their interest was intensified by
the throaty rumbling of the distant guns.

It was an hour of high suspense. For this hour every man present had waited
with a keen desire that had been his prompter and spur through all the long,
wearying months of training. All the schooling in theory was now behind.
Experience, that hard teacher, was now at the controls. The school of machine
gunnery, where dummies and swift moving targets had served as theoretical
enemies, was now to become a real school where the enemy was also armed and
where mistakes and misses were likely to hurl the pupil out of the class with
never a chance to profit by the mistake.

The dawn patrol! The day! From this hour they would begin to tally their
earned victories. On this night, if lucky enough to encounter the enemy, some of
them would send in reports that would start them up the ladder toward that
coveted rank       an ace! It never entered the mind of any one of them that
some enemy pilot, already an ace and rich in experience, might send in a report
fattening his record and increasing his fame. No, no! Air battle is made
possible only by thoughts of victory.

189McGee walked
over to Yancey       s plane. The gangling Texan was testing his rudder controls
and flipping his ailerons with jerky movements of evident impatience.

       I want you to know,        McGee said to him,        that I did not
ask for this flight. It is yours, by rights.       

Yancey       s grin was genuinely friendly.        Shucks, that       s
nothin       . I       m glad to be out. Bein        a flight leader sorter
cramped my style anyhow. This way I can do a little free-lancin              if
I see some cold turkey.       

       You leave cold turkey alone and stay in formation,        McGee
replied.        Just remember, old man Shakespeare was talking about the air
service when he said        things are not always what they seem       .       

       I       ll be good unless I spot some of those German observation
balloons. I       ve a sneaky feelin        I could eat up two or three of those
sausages before I come back here for breakfast without havin        my appetite
spoiled.       

McGee shook his head in serious warning.        Leave them alone, Yancey.
They look easy, but the Archie gunners can fill the air around        em so full
of lead that a bee couldn       t fly through. And as for flaming
onions       boy! We are out on combat patrol, remember. This is no
joy-ride.       

       Sure. But              

That moment Major Cowan came running across <a
id='page_190'>190the field and hurried up to McGee. His excitement
was evident in every movement.

       Orders just came,        he began, hurriedly,        for every
available ship to proceed to the bridges at Dormans and Chateau-Thierry. Bombers
are going up, also. The Germans have started a big drive.       

His manner, and the electrifying words, had drawn every man around him in a
close circle.        That       s what all the gun fire is about       barrages
and counter-barrages. Disregard the patrol orders, Lieutenant, and proceed with
these two flights to Dormans       at once! You are to do everything in your
power to retard the enemy advance, harass their troops, and especially harass
their advanced positions and lines of supply. Do you understand?       

       Perfectly, sir.       

       Good! Take off at once! I will at once get out all other available
ships and lead them against the lines at Chateau-Thierry. You       ve the head
start, and must, therefore, take Dormans. Snappy, now!       

A cheer went up from those pilots who a moment before had been cursing the
luck that had left them behind. They started running for the hangars.

As McGee climbed into his plane, Yancey        blipped        his motor and
shouted,        Who said this wasn       t a joy-ride?       

The revving motors drowned out all other sounds. Helmets were given a last
minute tug.

191McGee looked
along the line and lifted his hand. The nine others chosen for dawn patrol
signaled their readiness.

Out came wheel chocks, motors roared into the smooth sound of ripping silk as
one by one they lurched down across the field and took the air.

The heart of every man in the flight, save McGee       s, was racing in tune
with his motor. Here was a mission so much more exciting than any dawn
patrol.

Harass the advancing enemy! And their line of supplies! Storm down and spew
out lead on the bridges where the troops would be crossing! Here was action of
the highest order, in which, in all probability, formation flying would be
broken up and it would be every fellow for himself.

McGee alone knew the danger and hazard of their mission. In a big push the
enemy planes would be out in great number, determined to sweep the air free of
resistance. To harass troops, McGee knew, they must fly low. In so doing they
would run a constant gauntlet of machine gun and rifle fire, in addition to
frequently traversing the line of flight of high angle heavy artillery. It was
not pleasant to think of meeting up with one of those big G.I. cans loaded with
enough high explosive to demolish a building. Just get in the way of one of them
and what would be left could be placed in a small basket. Added to all this was
the fact that all altitude was sacrificed, and <a
id='page_192'>192a green pilot, out cutting eye-teeth, needs altitude
in case of attack.

To McGee the outlook was gloomy enough. Doubtless the venture would run up a
stiff casualty list, but every needed sacrifice must be made here! And now! The
French and Americans below must not let the Hun break through. Paris, all too
near, was the objective of the drive. If they broke through and reached
Paris       well, they must not break through!

McGee saw the planes of another American squadron working up toward the front
on his left. High above his flight was a large group of French Spads. He watched
them, turning his head aloft from time to time. They seemed to be hovering over
him and following his course. Far ahead, and below, he could see enemy
observation balloons straining at their cables. Black geysers of earth, sand,
and mud, were spouting from the tortured strip along the river. The earth below
was an inferno of flashing, thundering shells. The front! And the drive was
on!

He glanced up again. The French Spads were still above, a trained,
experienced group of war hawks sent up to take care of the
       upstairs        fighting while the Americans did the dirty work below.
Cowan had not mentioned this. Perhaps he did not know of it. McGee knew that in
big operations, and especially in such emergencies as this, orders were issued
without disclosing the whole plan to all participants. If <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>193each unit obeys and carries out the
orders received, then all goes well.

So far, all was well, and McGee was extremely grateful for that protecting
flight of Spads.

He determined to cross the river west of Dormans, make a thrust well back of
the lines, cut out again over Dormans and then, if luck were with them, repeat
the performance. No need to lay plans too far in advance. Too much can happen in
the tick of a second       things that knock plans and the planner into a cocked
hat.

Below them now was a far-flung battle of raging intensity. German troops
could be seen moving along toward the river, and a little farther inland McGee
spotted a long line of infantrymen along a road paralleling the river. But they
were moving westward, in the direction of Chateau-Thierry, instead of toward the
bridgehead at Dormans. And in addition to the marching men, the road was choked
with artillery, caissons, ammunition wagons, and ambulances.

Here was an opportunity made to order, and just as McGee was preparing to
give the signal, he saw Yancey cut out and dive toward an observation balloon
that was being rapidly drawn down by excited winchmen. No use to try to signal
Yancey; that wild Texan was off on his joy-ride.

Archies and machine gun fire tried vainly to stop Yancey       s wild dive.
Flaming onions began surging <a
id='page_194'>194upward in their terrifying circlets, but Yancey was
as scornful of them as is a Texas steer of a buzzing deer fly. His guns rattled
in a short burst and the balloon exploded with a terrific blast of flame and
smoke. Yancey       s plane rocked perilously. His inexperience in
       busting balloons        had come near being his own undoing. But he
righted his plane, somehow escaped the hail of shot and steel all around him and
came plunging back down the road filled with fear-stricken men and plunging
horses, his guns rattling joyously.

McGee, followed by Siddons, Porter and Fouche, swooped along the road from
the opposite direction, scattering the troops like chaff. With death raining
down on them from opposite but converging points, the German infantrymen broke
wildly for cover. Their less fortunate comrades, the cannoneers and drivers of
caissons and supply wagons, stuck to their posts, trying to calm the rearing,
plunging horses and cursing the inexorable wasps that sent stinging death down
on them.

Yancey, in particular, seemed to be in his glory. Half a dozen times he swung
around, gained a little altitude, and again went plowing down along the road,
his guns jumping and smoking in fiendish delight.

Harass the advancing enemy, eh? And the line of supplies? A job exactly
suited to Yancey       s heart and spirit.

195But McGee was
wise in such matters, and having delivered a blow drew off and sought other
fields to conquer. It was not wise to stay long in any one place.

He had expected Yancey to follow, but that worthy was too delighted with his
find, and when he tired of it at last it was to discover that he was very much
alone. Nothing could have suited him better. Now he was answerable only to
himself       and to Luck!

He began climbing, and casting an eye over the sky for balloons within
striking distance. After all, strafing infantrymen wasn       t half as much fun
as knocking down balloons. They went up with such a glorious bang! And it was
delicious to watch the frightened observer tumble over the side of the basket in
an effort to escape by parachute. That last one had somehow gotten fouled in the
rigging and had been clawing frantically when the bag exploded. As for that,
Yancey had been sorry; not for the man, but because he had wanted to see the
parachute poof-op! into a suddenly blown white flower at which he might
take a few shots by way of testing his aim. Well, maybe he       d have better
luck with the next one.

With no thought of danger, and with his heart racing in a new exhilaration
which he had never before felt, Yancey started out alone on a career that was to
bring him a fame coveted by every man in the squadron, but a fame which they did
not care to gain by this most hazardous of war sports              balloon
busting.        <a
id='page_196'>196Only men who cannot, or will not weigh danger,
become balloon busters. And of these was Yancey, the        flying fool       
of the squadron, concerning whom there was never any agreement among the others
as to whether he didn       t know any better or knew better and did it
because it was dangerous.



McGee, with Siddons, Porter and Fouche following, swung eastward toward
Dormans. Above them, as a protecting layer, flew Larkin with his flight, and
still above them, much higher, were the French Spads.

This state of affairs could not last long, McGee knew. It was only a question
of time until German planes would come up and accept the gage of battle. It was
a situation, therefore, calling for the greatest effort possible in the shortest
length of time.

Every movement below offered positive proof that the enemy were concentrating
in the direction of Chateau-Thierry, and if they were in fact making a thrust to
the eastward it was only to draw attention from the real objective.

For once McGee decided to disregard the Major       s orders and, instead of
proceeding to Dormans, swing back and do all he could at the bridgeheads at
Chateau-Thierry.

He swung around, and as he banked caught sight of <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>197seven or eight German planes coming up
from the northwest. He looked aloft. The Spads had seen them, too, and were
closing in.

McGee began climbing, and noted with satisfaction that Larkin, on the alert,
was waggling his wings as a signal that he too had seen them and was
prepared.

Then, for apparently no reason at all, Siddons cut out of the flight and
started streaking it for the lines.

For a brief moment McGee felt a burning desire to take after him and turn his
guns loose on him.

       Traitorous hound!        he muttered to himself.        I wondered how
you could follow when we were strafing those troops. I       ll bet anything he
never warmed his guns. Of course he wouldn       t!       

But just now there was business at hand more urgent than chasing after a man
whom he felt sure was both a traitor and a coward.

Above him the Spads were engaged in a merry dog fight with the German
Albatrosses. But two of the Germans had somehow eluded them and were diving down
on Larkin       s flight.

The action of the next moment was too swift for words. The two Albatrosses
came bravely on, scorning the odds against them. Larkin       s plane engaged
the first one, but the second one got in a lucky burst that sent one of the
Nieuports nosing down in a disabled effort to make a safe landing. And perhaps
the luckless pilot could have saved his life to spend <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>198the rest of the war in a German prison
camp but for the fact that the German who had crippled him, tasting blood,
wanted a more complete victory. Down, down, he followed the plane, spitting lead
at the poor pilot who seemed unable to think of anything except getting to the
earth.

As the planes came down to a level with McGee       s flight, Red whipped
around and closed in on the pursuer. Too late! Flame came curling, licking from
the motor of the Nieuport. That second, for the first time, McGee recognized it
as Randolph Hampden       s ship. Poor Hampden! The only man in the squadron who
ever had a good word for Siddons, and now he was going down in flames while
Siddons, supposedly his friend, was high-tailing it for home.

With bitterest venom McGee thumbed his trigger releases as he caught a
fleeting glimpse of the Albatross in the ring sight. But that German was not
only courageous       he was a consummate flyer. He whipped around with
surprising speed and came streaming at McGee with both guns going. Head on he
came, and there was something about the desperation of the move that told McGee
that the battle-crazed fellow would actually ram him in mid-air.

McGee dived. So close was the other upon him that he imagined he could feel
the wheels of the undercarriage on his own wings.

He Immelmanned, only to discover that by some <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>199brilliantly rapid manoeuver the German
had rolled into position and was rattling bullets into the Camel       s motor.
Crack! One of the bullets struck a vital part and the motor started limping.
McGee       s heart came into his mouth. He was disabled and       

That moment Hank Porter and Fouche closed in on the German and Larkin came
diving down from above. Three against one! McGee, despite his own predicament,
felt like saluting the fellow       s dare-devil courage. Larkin could take care
of him alone, even should Porter and Fouche fail.

Certain of the outcome of the now unequal struggle, McGee turned the nose of
his pounding plane in the direction of the lines near Mezy, and prayed fervently
that the failing motor would not conk completely before he reached and crossed
the river. He had no desire whatsoever to spend the remainder of the war in a
German prison. Even that, however, was preferable to being sent down in flames,
and he kept a sharp lookout for any attack that might come from some keen-eyed
German looking for        cold meat.       

Presently he noticed a shadow sweep across his plane. He glanced up
fearfully, and then smiled with delight. It was Larkin, following along to give
battle to any or all who might pounce upon his friend. McGee felt a new surge of
hope. Why had he even thought he would have to make the trial alone? Larkin, who
never deserted, who never failed in a pinch, <a
id='page_200'>200had disposed of that German in great haste and was
ready for whatever the next few minutes might bring.

For McGee those next minutes were filled with a thousand misgivings. The ship
was losing altitude rapidly, and the motor was pounding furiously, but if it
would only hold up he could make it.

When he flashed across the river at Mezy, with some eight hundred feet to
spare, he turned and waved a light-hearted O.K. to Larkin, and began to look
for some landing place free of shell craters.

It was not unlike looking for land in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
Barrage after barrage had marked the earth with the deep scarred pocks of war.
He must push on toward the rear with the last inch that could be wrung from that
motor and then land straight ahead, leaving the outcome to Lady Luck. She had
never deserted him completely       

That moment she deserted. The motor conked with a non-stuttering finality.
Now for a dead stick landing, straight ahead! If he could only pancake her down
just beyond that big hole, maybe she would stop rolling       

He pancaked, but in doing so struck too hard. The undercarriage was wiped out
completely. He felt the bound, followed by a terrific up-fling of the tail, and
then a thousand stars went shooting before his eyes and it seemed that a
lightning bolt rived his brain. Then darkness       and an infinite
peace....


201CHAPTER XMedals and Chevrons


1


When McGee next opened his eyes, it was upon a world in which white seemed to
be the shockingly outstanding scheme of things. White walls, a white painted
fence, which he at last concluded must be the end of an iron bed, and just
beyond this, near at hand yet seemingly miles and miles away, a woman in
spotless white. He couldn       t quite make out her face, in fact all detail
was lost in a dim haze that refused to be cleared up by a blinking of the eyes.
And there was such a roaring sound, as of a mighty waterfall thundering down
into an echoing canyon.

Oh, yes! His head. He tried to lift his left hand to feel of his head, but
the muscles failed to respond. Indeed, the arm seemed not only lifeless, but to
be clamped firmly across his chest by tight bonds. He tried the right arm. It
responded, and the hand came up to touch and wonder at the large bundle of cloth
that should be his head.

The woman in white moved toward him, quickly, and he was about to form a
question when she faded <a
id='page_202'>202before his very eyes, and the thundering waterfall
left off its roaring as he floated out of the world of white into a black,
obliterating nothingness.

Hours later he again opened his eyes. Again he saw a woman in white at the
foot of what he now knew to be a bed. She smiled, a sort of cheery, wordless
greeting. He could see distinctly now, and the thunder of the rushing torrent
had subsided until it was little more than a wind whispering among the tree
tops. But the left arm was still lifeless and numb, and his head felt as large
as a tub.

       Where am I?        he asked, and was startled by the feebleness of the
voice which seemed in no way related to him.

The woman in white bent over him, smoothing the pillow and pressing him back
upon it.

       You must be quiet,        she said,        and not talk, or try to
move.       

Funny thing to say. Why shouldn       t he talk       especially when he had
so much to learn about this strange place?

       But where am              

The figure in white began fading away again, a most distressing habit, and
darkness again rushed at him from the white walls.

Hours later he again opened his eyes, realizing at once that it was night,
though objects could be dimly seen by the glow of the one light at the far end
of the 203room. He
could hear voices, and with a slight turn of the head saw a man in uniform
talking with the white-clad woman who could so suddenly and miraculously
disappear. At the movement the man turned quickly.

It was Larkin, and the worried lines in his face were swept away by a quick,
cheery smile as he bent over the bed and pressed McGee       s right hand in a
manner that spoke more than words.

       What happened, Buzz?        McGee asked, and was again surprised at
the thin quality of his voice.

       You       re all right, old hoss,        Larkin evaded,        but you
mustn       t talk yet. Be quiet now. To-morrow night I       ll be back and
tell you all about it.       

       But              

       Quiet now! See you to-morrow,        and with another squeeze of the
hand he was gone.

Well, McGee thought, it was rather tiring to try to think. Sleep was so
easy       and so soft.


2


The following evening Larkin came back again, just as the nurse had finished
giving McGee a light, liquid meal.

       Hello, you little shrimp!        he sang out cheerily.        Eyes
bright and everything! Old Saw Bones just told me I could see you for five
minutes       but to do <a
id='page_204'>204all the talking. You can have three questions
only.       

A thin, tired smile came to McGee       s freckled face, a face almost hidden
under the bandages that completely covered his head.

       All right,        he said.        First question       will I fly
again?       

       Of course! In four or five weeks you       ll be good as
new.       

       Four or five weeks! What              

       Careful now, or you       ll use up all your questions. When you set
that Camel down in a shell hole she flipped over and your head was slightly
softer than a big rock that happened to be handy. I would have bet on the rock
being softest, but it seems I       d lost. You went blotto. A bunch of soldiers
dragged you out from under what was left of that Camel       which wasn       t
much. Then an ambulance brought you back here. This hospital is about five kilos
from squadron headquarters, and I       ve been back here twice a day for the
past five days, worrying my head off for fear you       d never come
to.       

       Five days?        Red responded, his voice indicating his
disbelief.

       Yep, five days. Three days passed before you even opened your eyes.
Try and land on your feet, next time.       

       The nurse tells me my left arm is broken,        McGee said.
       Wonder how I got that?       

<a
id='page_205'>205       You       ve used up all your
questions,        Larkin told him, laughing,        and I       ve used up all
my time. I want to be good so that Old Saw Bones will let me see you to-morrow
night.       

       Wait,        McGee began, but the nurse interposed herself.

       No more to-night,        she said.        In a day or two you can talk
as much as you like.       

The next two or three days passed slowly for McGee. Each night Larkin came
back from squadron headquarters in a motor cycle side car, but his stays were so
brief that Red had no chance to get any but the most fragmentary news.

As for news from the front, he could drag nothing from the nurses or from
Larkin, and when he inquired after members of the squadron Buzz would reply with
an evasive,        Oh, they       re all right,        and shift the
conversation into the most commonplace channels.

Ten days of this, and the surgeon gave his O.K. to the use of a wheel chair,
which was pushed around the grounds by one of the hospital orderlies. The
grounds were extremely beautiful, the hospital having been a famous resort hotel
before the exigencies of warfare required its conversion into one of the
thousands of hospitals scattered throughout France.

Great beech and chestnut trees covered the lawn, and to one side was a
miniature lake, centered by a <a
id='page_206'>206sparkling fountain, on whose wind-dimpled surface
graceful, proud swans moved with a stately ease that scorned haste or show of
effort.

On the second day of exploration in the wheel chair, Larkin came in the
afternoon and, relieving the orderly, pushed Red       s chair down to a deep
shaded spot by the side of the pond.

       I can       t see why they won       t let me walk around,       
McGee complained.        There       s nothing wrong with my legs.       

       No, but they       re not so sure about that head, yet. Another few
days and you       ll be running foot races,        Larkin assured him.

       How long does it take a broken arm to heal, Buzz?       

       Two or three weeks       maybe four. You had a bad break. Maybe a
little longer. You       re lucky, after all       maybe.       

       What do you mean, lucky?        Red looked at him quizzically.

       Well, some of the boys haven       t gotten off so easy.       

       See here, Buzz, I       m tired of snatches of news. Tell me all you
know about       about everything. Back here the war seems so far away       and
unreal. Except for all these wounded men, and the uniforms, I       d never
think of it. No guns, no action, no       no dawn patrols. I feel like a fish
out of water. But there <a
id='page_207'>207must be some little old war going on up there.
I       ve heard about Chateau-Thierry, by piecemeal. Boy! It was the big show
starting the very morning I got it, and we didn       t even know it. Just my
luck to get forced down at a time like that!       

       Maybe not so tough,        Buzz answered.        A Blighty, if it
doesn       t cripple, is not so bad. Our casualties have been nearly forty per
cent, from one cause or another.       

       No!        Red exclaimed in surprise.

Larkin nodded, dourly.        They sure have! We       ve been up against von
Herzmann       s Circus most of the time, and that fellow hasn       t any
slouches on his roster. That was one of his outfit that cracked your
engine.       

       Really? Did you get him?        Red asked, his face alight with
interest.

Larkin shook his head.        No luck. I ducked to follow you. But Fouche got
him       his first that morning.       

       That morning? You mean he              

       Got another one, a flamer, just back of Chateau-Thierry. That boy is
some flyer! He       s an ace already.       

McGee       s delight was genuine.        That       s great! Never can tell,
can you? I didn       t think much of his work.        He hesitated, wanting to
inquire about the others but held back by that statement of Larkin       s <span
class='pagenum pncolor'>208to the effect that
casualties were above forty per cent. He feared he would ask about someone whose
name was now enrolled in that sickening total.

       What about       Yancey?        he tried.

Larkin laughed.        Oh, that Texas cyclone is as wild as a range horse and
is due to get potted any minute. In fact, he       s overdue. He       s a
balloon busting fool, and no one can stop him. He has nine of them to his credit
and every time he goes out he comes back with his plane in shreds and just
barely holding together. You       d think it would cure him, but he eats
shrapnel. Has two planes to his credit, but he doesn       t go in for planes.
He cuts formation exactly like you used to, Shrimp, and goes off high, wide and
lonesome, looking for sausages. He got one just this morning, and I give you my
word his ship looked like a sieve when he came in. The Major threatens to ground
him if he doesn       t quit cutting formation, but he       s only bluffing.
He       s as proud as the rest of us.       

       So Cowan is all right?        Red asked.

       He sure is all right,        Larkin enthused.        He       s
an intolerable old fuss budget and hard to get along with when on the ground or
out of action, but he       s square, he       s developed into a real
commander, and he       s got sand a-plenty. He       s coming down to see you
to-morrow       and that       s going some for Cowan. He likes you a
lot.       

209Red colored, and
to change the subject, asked,        What about Hampden? Didn       t I see him
go down just before I caught it?       

       Yes. Flamer. Poor devil!       

To Red       s mind came the picture of Siddons, fleeing from the field of
action a few minutes before the tragic death of the only man in the squadron who
really called him friend. Friend, indeed!

       I suppose Siddons is still on top,        McGee said, somewhat
bitterly.        His kind never get it.       

A troubled look spread over Larkin       s face.        You know,        he
began slowly,        none of us can figure out that fellow. He didn       t get
back to the squadron that day until just at dark. The news of Hampden       s
death seemed to daze him, but he didn       t say a word. Two days later he left
the squadron, and we thought he was gone for good       grounded for keeps or
sent home. But yesterday he turned up again, big as life. If Cowan is
displeased, he doesn       t show it. We can       t figure it out.       

       I can!        McGee flared, then suddenly remembered that Cowan had
charged him with absolute secrecy concerning the discoveries he had made.

       Well then, what       s the dope?        Larkin asked.

       Oh, he       s got a heavy drag somewhere,        Red replied,
remembering that he had passed his word to Major Cowan.        What about Hank
Porter?        he asked, to shift the subject.

210Larkin shook his
head, dismally.        Another one of Herzmann       s Circus filled him full of
lead, but he tooled his ship back home before he fainted from loss of blood.
He       s in a hospital for the rest of the war. May never walk
again.       

McGee decided to do no more roll calling for the day. It was altogether too
depressing. For a while they talked of lighter, commonplace things and then fell
into that understanding silence that is possible only with those whose
friendship is so firmly fixed that words add little to their communion.

Watching the swans that moved around the central fountain in stately
procession, McGee fell to thinking how little those lovely creatures knew of
tragedy and sorrow. Theirs was a world secure in beauty, unmarred by the things
which man brings upon himself, and this was true because they knew nothing of
avarice or grasping greed. Could it be that man, in all his pride, was one of
the least sensible of God       s creatures?


3


The day following, Major Cowan called, and in his elation over the success of
American arms at the recent battle of Chateau-Thierry, told McGee more in a
short half hour than Red had been able to worm from all others with whom he
talked.

211The Germans,
Cowan told him, had been stopped at Chateau-Thierry in an epic stand made by the
2nd and 3rd Divisions, A.E.F., and a few days later the Marines had crowned
themselves with a new glory when, in liaison with the French, they had stormed
the edges of Belleau Wood, gained a foothold, and then tenaciously pushed slowly
forward in the bloodiest and bitterest battle yet waged by the untried American
forces. Counter-attack after counter-attack had been met and repulsed, with the
net result that the Germans had been definitely stopped in the Marne salient.
Their hope of breaking through to Paris was shattered, and though they were
still pounding hard, their sacrifices were vain.

It was, Cowan declared, the real turning point of the war, and even now men
were joyously declaring that the war would be won by Christmas.

As for the air forces, they had delivered beyond the fondest hopes of the
high command. The casualties had been high, Cowan admitted, but not higher than
might be expected and not without giving even heavier losses to the enemy. The
squadron losses could have been held down had the members been less keen about
scoring a personal victory over von Herzmann. Every pursuit pilot along the
entire front was willing to take the most desperate chances in the hope of
plucking the crest feathers of this German war eagle.

       I guess there       s one member not particularly anxious <span
class='pagenum pncolor'>212to pluck any of the
eagle       s feathers,        McGee put in at this point.

       No?        Cowan       s voice was quizzical.        Who       s
that?       

       Siddons,        McGee replied tersely.

A look of aggravation, or of pained tolerance, crossed Cowan       s
face.

       We won       t discuss that,        he said, deserting for the moment
his air of good-fellowship and returning to the quick, testy manner of speaking
which was so characteristic of him in matters of decision.        I take it you
have said nothing to Larkin, or anyone else, concerning your       ah, our
suspicions?       

       Nothing, sir. But I can       t              

       Good. Let Intelligence work it out, Lieutenant. One little rumor might
upset all their plans. I can assure you, however, that G 2 knows all that you
know. They are waiting the right minute       and perhaps have some plan in
mind. Silence and secrecy are their watchwords. Let them be yours.        He
arose and extended his hand.        I must be moving along. I       m glad to
see you doing so nicely. You       ll be more than welcome when you get back to
the squadron. Don       t worry. There       s plenty of war left
yet.       


4


Perhaps there was plenty of war left, but McGee <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>213soon discovered that a badly broken arm
and a cracked, cut head can be painfully slow in healing. Days dragged slowly
by, with Larkin       s visits as the only bright spot in the enforced
inactivity. Then, to McGee       s further distress, the squadron was moved to
another front. Larkin had been unable to tell him just where they were going,
but believed it was to the eastward, where it was rumored the Americans were to
be given a purely American sector.

This was unpleasant news to McGee. It meant that he would be left behind, and
he could not drag from the hospital medicoes any guess as to when he would be
permitted to leave the hospital.

Hospital life, with its endless waiting, sapped his enthusiasm. At night, in
the wards, the men recovering from all manner of wounds would try to speed the
lagging hours by telling stories, singing songs, and inventing the wildest of
rumors. Occasionally, when the lights were out, some wag would begin an
imitation of a machine gun, with its rat-tat-tat-tat, and another, catching the
spirit of the mimic warfare, would make the whistling sound of a high angle
shell. In a few moments the ward would be a clamorous inferno of mimic battle
sounds       machine guns popping, shells screaming toward explosion, cries of
gas, and the simulated agonized wails of the wounded and dying.

       Hit the dirt! Here comes a G.I. can.       

214       Look out
for that flying pig!       

       Over the top, my buckoes, and give        em the bayonet.       

Thus did men, wrecks in the path of war, keep alive their spirit and courage
by jesting over the grimest tragedy that had ever entered their lives. And then
they would take up rollicking marching songs, or sing dolefully,        I wanta
go home, I wanta go home.       

Invariably, when some chap began a narrative of the prowess of his own
company or regiment, the others would begin singing, tauntingly:


       The old grey mare she ain       t            what she used to
be, She ain       t what she used to be,             Ain       t
what she used to be. The old grey mare she ain       t
            what she used to be Many years ago....        

It wasn       t really fun, it was only the pitifully weak effort to meet
suffering, loneliness, homesickness and fear with bravado.

There is no one in all the world more lonely than a soldier in a hospital.
Time becomes what it really is, endless, and without hope of a change on the
morrow.

And the pay for it all was a gold wound chevron to wear on the sleeve, or a
dangling, glittering medal testifying to courage and sacrifice!


215CHAPTER XIThe Ace and the Spy


1


So slow was McGee       s recovery that it was the middle of September before
he received his final discharge from the hospital and was given orders to rejoin
his old squadron, now operating in the St. Mihiel salient. Three days prior to
his release the American Army, operating on a purely American front, had
attacked the Germans in the St. Mihiel salient with such determined vigor, and
the entire preparation conducted with such successful secrecy, as to take the
Germans by complete surprise, overrun all opposition and recover for France many
miles of territory long held by the invaders. Thousands of prisoners, and arms
of all calibre, were captured in the swift stroke, and all France was ringing
with praise of the endeavor.

News of the progress of the battle reached McGee just before his final
discharge. He entertained high hopes of rejoining the squadron in time to
participate in the feast of victory, but by the 15th, three days after the
battle was begun, the salient had been pinched out and the battle won.

216On the 16th,
when McGee reached Ligny-en-Barrois, which had served as General
Pershing       s field headquarters at the beginning of the operation, he found
that his squadron had been withdrawn from the sector and sent somewhere
else.

Where? No one seemed to know. Furthermore, no one seemed to care a great
deal. A pilot lost from his squadron, or a soldier lost from his regiment, was
no new thing in France. It happened daily. Men were discharged from hospitals,
ordered to a certain point to rejoin their commands, only to discover on
reaching there that the outfit had seemingly vanished in thin air.

McGee spent a full day trying to find someone with the correct information as
to the location of the squadron.

At last an officer on the General Staff looked over McGee       s papers and
gave him a transportation order to a little town west and south of Verdun.

       Is my squadron there, sir?        McGee asked.

       They should be,        the officer replied.        At least near
there,        and he closed the conversation as though that were quite enough
for any pilot to know.

But when McGee reached the town, part of the journey being by rail and part
by motor lorries, he found himself as completely lost as possible. Again no one
seemed to know anything about the squadron. His search was made doubly difficult
by the fact that <a
id='page_217'>217there was an unusual air of activity; all the troops
seemed to be on the move, and officers were far too busy with their own cares to
listen to the troubles of a lost aviator.

That night McGee watched two or three regiments pass through the town, fully
equipped for battle. It came to him, suddenly, that all this activity and night
marching could mean only one thing       a new attack along some new front.
Encouraged by the success of St. Mihiel, the Americans were going in again. But
where? McGee put the question to a dozen officers, and not one of them had the
foggiest notion of where he was going.

This served all the more to convince McGee that a new operation was being
secretly planned by Great Headquarters, and from the many different divisional
insignias which he had noticed, he felt convinced that it would be a major
offensive. Regiment after regiment of soldiers marched through the little
village; then came lumbering guns and caissons clattering over the resounding
cobblestones of the street. Battery after battery passed by. They were followed
by a long train of motor transports; then came some hospital units with their
motor ambulances; then more infantrymen, singing and joking as they swung along
in the darkness.

Watching them, McGee was suddenly seized with an idea which no amount of
logical thinking could exclude <a
id='page_218'>218from his mind. Where these troops were going, there
he would find action. Somewhere, between this point and their final stopping
place, the trenches, he would find some unit of the air force. The army must
have its eyes, and any member of any air unit could tell him more than he could
learn here.

The spirit of this new type of adventure moved him to action. He had often
wondered about the life of the doughboy. Now, for the night, he would fall in
and march along with them. It would be fun just to be going along, answerable to
no one and making his way forward on foot, by hooked rides, or by whatever means
that presented itself and seemed attractive.

Slinging his musette bag over his shoulder, and buttoning up his flying coat,
he stepped into the street, followed along the dark buildings for a few yards
and then fell in alongside a long line of infantrymen.

A mile beyond the edge of the town he regretted his action. Rain began to
fall in torrents. Ponchos were quickly donned by the men and they again took up
the splashing, sloshing line of march, grumbling a little, joking about
       Sunny France,        and complaining over the harsh order that forbade
smoking.

From that one thing McGee knew for a certainty that they were being sent
forward under orders of the utmost secrecy. Men on the line of march under cover
of darkness were never allowed to smoke. An <a
id='page_219'>219enemy airman, should he pass over, would see a long
line of twinkling fireflies. From that he would know there was some sort of
movement, and this information would be speedily carried to the German High
Command. So, without displaying any lights whatsoever, the men and motors moved
ever forward along the muddy road.

The rain ceased as suddenly as it had come. The night was warm, for
September, and grey fog wraiths began rising from the ground. The sweating
horses, straining at the big heavy guns at the side of the road, were blanketed
in steam.

The traffic on the pitch black road was becoming increasingly heavy, and now
and again halts were made until someone, far ahead, succeeded in working out the
snarl. Then the troops would move forward again.

McGee no longer had any doubts concerning what was in store for these
thousands upon thousands of men, but he was beginning to question the wisdom of
his own move. He made no attempt to engage anyone in conversation, fearing that
it would result in some officious commander ordering him to the rear.

Far ahead, against the black night sky, flashes of gunfire showed now and
then, the following thunder establishing the fact that the front was within
three or four hours        marching time. The gunfire, however, was not heavy,
being merely the spasmodic firing incident <a
id='page_220'>220to such nights as communiques spoke of as
       calm.       

After another hour of marching, McGee noticed that they were on the edge of a
shattered village. Not one single wall stood intact. As he reached the center of
this stark skeleton of a once happy village he saw that here the enemy had
concentrated their fire. Here was a wall, standing gaunt and grim against the
night sky; and over there, facing a little square, a shattered church still
retained the strength to hold aloft its cross-capped steeple. The Cross ... in a
broken, blood-red world!

McGee slowed his pace, gradually, and dropped from the line of march. He had
considered himself fully recovered, but the last hour had sapped his small
reserve of strength. He seated himself on a pile of stone in the dark corner of
a protecting wall and wiped his brow. What with the long, hot march, and the
steam arising from the soaked earth, he was wringing wet. The experience had
served to increase his respect for these plodding doughboys who considered this
as only one more night like dozens of others they had experienced.

Sitting there on the damp, cold stone, McGee considered his position. This
town, battered by shell fire, would be forward of any position taken up by a
pursuit group. To push on would be but to retrace his steps. It would also be
folly, for he had no gas <a
id='page_221'>221mask. Shells had reached this town before, and they
might do so again. He was willing to take a chance with flying shrapnel, but
deadly gas was something else again.

He decided, therefore, to make his way to the edge of the town, find shelter
if possible, and await the coming of dawn. Daylight, he reasoned, would be
certain to bring him in sight of planes from some group, operating on this
front, and if he could locate a        drome his problem would be near solution.

He made his way back along the lines of infantrymen, artillery, ambulances
and wagon trains until he reached an old stone stable that had miraculously
escaped destruction.

Having no light, he groped around in the black interior, seeking a place
where he might spread his coat for a bed. He stumbled against a ladder, which
mounted upward into the cavernous mow of a loft. He climbed the creaking rungs,
found footing on the dry floor, and stopped to sniff at the odor of the few
wisps of dry, musty hay scattered thinly over the rough boards. He took a step
forward, stumbled over a pair of legs and landed headfirst on the stomach of
another sleeper.

       Whoosh!        went the escaping breath of that truant soldier,
followed by an angry outpouring of abuse.

       Say, soldier! Get your foot out of my face! What do you think this
is       a football game?       

222       Pipe
down!        came a gruff voice from another corner.        Do you want some
smart Looie to come up here and chase us out?       

McGee smiled, wondering what would be their reaction should he announce that
       a Looie        was even now in their presence. Perhaps it was his duty,
as an officer, to rout them out and order them to rejoin their commands, but he
felt no responsibility for these men of the line, and if they were as weary and
sleepy as he       and doubtless they had more reason to be       then he could
hardly blame them for falling out. With the morning, he knew, these army-wise
soldiers would go down the road until they found their outfits and there pour
forth a plausible lie about becoming lost in the tangle and how they had
searched all night for their company.

McGee knew little enough about the American infantrymen, but he did know that
       for tricks that are vain        Bret Harte       s famous heathen Chinee
had nothing on the average soldier of the line, be he American, English, French
or a black man from Senegal.

Cautiously he felt out a clear space, spread his coat over the rough timbers
and was soon sound asleep.


2


While McGee slept soundly, blissfully removed <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>223from all scenes of conflict and
completely ignorant of his exact location, a midnight conference of gravest
nature was taking place in the little settlement of Landres-et-St. Georges, far
behind the German lines of defense.

Four thick-necked, grey-haired German officers were seated at a long table in
the front room of a chateau that had been in German hands for more than three
years. Candles flickered uncertainly on the table, lighting the center of the
large room but leaving the corners in dim shadows.

The four officers sat stiffly erect, without comment, their eyes on the
double door as though they were awaiting someone. Outside, on the stone flagging
of a courtyard, sounded the heavy tread of a Prussian Guardsman walking guard
before the sanctum of these        Most High        ones who sat so stolidly
waiting.

The resounding footfalls of the guardsman came to a clicking halt, followed
by a guttural challenge which was replied to in a softer voice. The guardsman
again took up his beat.

A moment later the door to the council room opened. A smooth-faced, blond
young man stood at stiff salute in the doorway       dressed in the uniform of
an English officer!

For a long minute he stood at salute while the four at the table eyed him
studiously. Then the hand came down, and a quick smile spread over his face
224as he stepped
forward into the brighter light of the room. He carried in his hand one of the
swagger sticks so commonly used by English officers.

       Well, Herr Hauptmann,        he addressed the officer at the
head of the table,        do you find my disguise, and my English, sufficiently
correct?       

       Correct, yes,        the heavy-jowled officer replied in German,
       but not pleasing, Count von Herzmann. Himmel!How I hate the sight
of the Englander       s uniform and the sound of his thin, squeaky tongue. And
I say to you again that this wild plan of yours is a fool       s errand. I
would forbid it, had you not gained the consent of the General Staff. I do not
understand it. You are too valuable to the cause for the General Staff to permit
you to take such a chance. I say again, it is a fool       s errand.       

Count von Herzmann smiled reassuringly.        Fool       s errand, Herr
Hauptmann?        he responded in German.        Is there anything more
precious to our cause than to learn just now where this next blow is to be
struck? For the past ten days all of our secret operatives have sent us
conflicting reports. The English and the French are too quiet on their fronts.
It presages a storm. As for the Americans, we need not worry. They are still
boasting of their victory at St. Mihiel. They will not be ready to strike again
before late Fall       perhaps not until Spring. We must              

       Speak in English,        interrupted one of the other <span
class='pagenum pncolor'>225officers.        Much as
we hate it, we must see to it that it is perfect.       

       Right you are!        von Herzmann replied with the perfect accent of
a well-bred Englishman.        My three years        schooling in England was
not for nothing, sir. Accent top hole, eh, what! Rawther.        He smiled at
his own mimicry.        I was saying,        he went on,        that we must
discover where the English will strike next. Victory depends upon it.       

       Ja, das ist richtig        spoke up the stolid
Oberst-leutnant, who had been listening without comment as his grey eyes,
deep set under stiff, bristling eyebrows, appraised the confident von Herzmann.
       Ja, we must learn where the swine strike next. But must it be you
to take the chance? You know the cost       should you fail?       

       Quite well, sir,        von Herzmann replied, smiling.        A little
party in front of a firing wall with myself as the center of attraction. Ah,
well! What matter. I have about played out my string of luck in the air. Sooner
or later, there must be an ending. I have a great fear that it will be the luck
of some cub, fresh at the front, to bring me down. Ha! How he would swank
around, boasting how he brought down the great von Herzmann. Bah! Death, Herr
Hauptmann, I do not fear in the least, but I hate the thought of a cub
boasting over my bones. Besides, there are no new adventures left for me in the
air. 226I am a little
weary of it all. But this       this is new adventure and              

       And deadly dangerous,        reminded the cadaverous, thin-faced
officer at the far end of the table.

       If not dangerous, it is not adventure, sir,        von Herzmann
replied.        Do we not all enjoy the thing that presents some hazard? Youth
lives it; age thrills to the reports of it. If I fail, I fail. If I succeed, the
Fatherland is well served and I       ve another adventure in my kit. Perhaps
even another bit of iron to dangle on my coat, eh? Rawther jolly prospect,
what?        He again smiled at his own mimicry, as well he might, for the
accent was perfect.        But I won       t fail, Herr Hauptmann.       
He became serious as he drew some papers from the breast pocket of his well
tailored, though well worn, English uniform coat which bore the marks of
campaigning.        See,        he said, tossing down a little black fold which
the English issued to officers for identification,        I am Lieutenant
Richard Larkin, R.F.C., known to his familiars as        Buzz.        The picture,
you will notice, is my own, placed there after we had carefully removed the one
of the gentleman whose uniform and identification card I am to make use of.

       This,        he tossed another paper on the table,        is a pass to
Paris, properly indorsed, and giving authority for refueling and repairing, if
needed. Neat enough, eh? The date, unfortunately, was originally <span
class='pagenum pncolor'>227in April, but our
Intelligence section has some very clever penmen and you will note that the date
now appearing there is as of September the twenty-sixth, and the period of the
pass is for five days.       

       The twenty-sixth!        exclaimed the Oberst-leutnant.
       So soon! That is the day after to-morrow.       

       Yes. Our operative will cross the lines to-morrow evening, just before
sundown, in a two-seater Nieuport. He will land just back of Montfaucon, and I
will then re-cross the lines, will be set down back of Neuvilly and will then
begin the great adventure. I am to be back within five days, or               he
shrugged his shoulder expressively.

One of the officers banged his fist on the table.        It is a fool       s
errand, I repeat, a fool       s errand! If this operative, with the Americans,
is back of Neuvilly, what is he doing there? Perhaps the Americans are there in
force, preparing to strike here.       

       Impossible!        the senior officer snorted.        Attack the
Hindenburg Line? The Americans are stupid, but not so stupid as that. We know
that a few Americans are in the sector south of Vauquois Hill. They are
relieving the French there. And for what reason? So that the French may be moved
up in the Champagne, east of the Meuse. That is where the blow will be struck.
But, even so, I have not the faith in this Operative Number Eighty-one which the
High Command seems to place in him.       

228       He has
brought us much information,        one of the others reminded.

       Yes, erroneous and tardy information. Not one thing have we learned
from him but what was too late to be of value. And much of it
inaccurate.       

       Not always,        von Herzmann replied.        He brought correct and
timely information concerning the movement of that new American pursuit
squadron, you will recall. And but for the accursed luck that brought those
French Spads upon us at the wrong time, my Circus would have potted half of
them.       

       Luck!        the senior officer retorted, heatedly.        You call it
luck! It was luck that we did not lose you and that you got your crippled plane
back across the line. But can you be sure that those Spads came upon the scene,
at the right moment, by chance?       

Count von Herzmann shook his head.        No, Herr Hauptmann, in this
war we can be sure of only one thing       death, if the war continues. It must
be brought to a speedy close. Daily, now, we lose ground. It is because of this
that I made the urgent request to be permitted to undertake this mission.
But,        he smiled expansively,        be not too fearful or alarmed. If I
fail, if there be trickery in it, you shall have the privilege of avenging
me.       

       How do you mean, avenge you?       

       Herr Hauptmann, war is a world-old game, with modern
applications. You have read, doubtless, <a
id='page_229'>229how in the olden times hostages were
held?       

       Yes, but              

       It is not always effective, but it furnishes the crumb of revenge and
retaliation. I am not without some fear for my safety, and because of that I
will provide a hostage.       

       You talk in riddles.       

       Perhaps, but I give you the answer. Operative Number Eighty-one will
come for me in a two-seater just at dark. But he will not be the one to take me
back.       

       Ach! Himmel!       

       Das ist ziemlich gescheit!       

Count von Herzmann shrugged his shoulders at the exclamatory surprise and
compliment.        Clever? No. Merely an old custom borrowed from old wars.
Operative Number Eighty-one will be held at the headquarters at
Montfaucon       pending my return. If I do not return in five days, then he too
will hold the stage a brief minute before a firing wall. Then, perhaps we will
meet beyond the Great Line       where there are no wars or rumors of wars. Is
there anything else you have to take up with me now, Herr
Hauptmann?       

       Ach, yes! If you are successful, and return within your scheduled
time, how will this operative, held at Montfaucon, make a satisfactory
explanation to the Americans regarding his long absence?       

230Count von
Herzmann snapped his fingers.        Poof! That is secondary, and a problem
which I leave to the superior mind of Herr Hauptmann       and the High
Command.       


231CHAPTER XIIWheels Within Wheels


1


Near noon, the following day, a motor cycle with side car snorted to a sudden
stop at the newly erected hangar tents of an American Pursuit Group, and McGee
crawled stiffly from the bone-racking, muscle-twisting        bath tub.       
He thanked the mud-splashed, goggled driver, adding, by way of left-handed
compliment, that he had been given more thrills in the last five kilometers than
he had received in all his months in the Allied Air Service.

He turned toward the hangar. There was but one ship on the field, a
two-seater. By its side stood Siddons and his air mechanic. They seemed to be in
close-headed conference.

McGee clicked his teeth in a little sound of suppressed emotion, slipped
through the hangar door and stood face to face with his own old Ack Emma.

       For the luva Pete!        exclaimed the startled air mechanic.
       When did you get here, Lieutenant?       

McGee extended his hand in greeting. Williams grasped it, eagerly.

232       Well, for
the luva Pete?        he repeated, lacking words in his surprise and pleasure.
       Lieutenant Larkin! Oh, Lieutenant Larkin!        he began roaring.
       Oh, Bill! Where       s Larkin?       

       Just left a minute ago,        came a voice from under the hood of a
new Spad.        Went over to his quarters to wash up. Grease from head to
foot.       

       I       ll go show you his quarters,        Williams said,
eagerly.

       Never mind, I       ll find him,        McGee said.        Have to
check in at headquarters first. I hear Cowan is still C.O.       

       Yes, sir. He sure is. And he       s a darb, Lieutenant.       

       So I hear. Piling up quite a record. How many of the old gang still
here, Williams?       

       Not many. If the Hun doesn       t get        em, nerves and the smell
of castor-oil does. Half a dozen of        em gone flooey in the stomach.
Couldn       t eat enough to keep a bird alive and couldn       t keep that
down. It       s a tough game, Lieutenant. Next war that comes yours truly is
going to join the infantry.       

       Don       t do it,        McGee warned, as he turned away.
       I       ve just had a little experience with the infantry and it       s
not such a bed of roses. See you later, Williams.       

       Well for the luva Pete!        Williams commented to himself, standing
arms akimbo as he watched McGee <a
id='page_233'>233cross over toward headquarters.        And they said
that bird       s head was busted wide open and his brains scattered all over
France. Now there he is, big as life. I       ll bet ten bucks to a lousy
centime he lives to fall off a merry-go-round and break his neck. For the luva
Pete!       


2


McGee       s return to the squadron would have been fittingly celebrated but
for the fact that five o       clock the following morning had been designated
as        zero hour        for the greatest drive ever undertaken by Americans
on foreign soil. He had arrived just in time to hurl himself into the feverish
preparations for the support which all air units must give the massed ground
forces that would hurl themselves upon the supposedly impregnable Hindenburg
Line. With the coming of dawn the combat squadrons must gain and hold air
supremacy. Nothing less than complete and absolute supremacy would satisfy Great
Headquarters, who in planning the drive were high in the hope that the fresh
divisions of American soldiers could break through the Hindenburg Line and by
hammering, hammering, hammering at the enemy force him into peace terms before
the coming of winter.

McGee was tickled pink by his timely arrival, but it was not all a matter of
rejoicing. For one thing, it <a
id='page_234'>234seemed that almost the entire group was made up of
new faces. Of those flight pilots whom he had first met when he came to the
squadron as an instructor, only three remained       Yancey, Nathan Rodd and
Siddons. Of course Larkin was still on top, and Cowan not only held his command,
but had established quite a reputation. Yancey had earned the right to a
nickname more appropriately fitting than        the flying fool,        for he
was anything but a fool and his mounting victories proved that he had something
more than luck.

Nathan Rodd, his nerve unshattered by his first unfortunate encounter with
the enemy, was still as taciturn as ever, preferring to let his deeds speak for
him.

As for Siddons, McGee could get no information out of Larkin save that
everyone thought that Siddons had some pull. A good flyer, yes, Larkin admitted,
but forever cutting formation, flying off where he pleased, absenting himself
for two or three days, and returning with the thinnest of excuses. But he got
by, somehow, and Cowan was the only one who appeared friendly toward him. For
the past twenty-four hours, Larkin told McGee, Siddons had been working on a
two-seater and had made two test flights. No one seemed to know what was back of
it, but rather believed Siddons was to be transferred to Observation, at least
during the coming battle.

235To this
information McGee made no reply, but secretly hoped that Siddons was in fact
being transferred to Observation, where his activities would be more easily
accounted for due to the fact that he would be carrying an observer.

Late that afternoon rain began falling, and at mess time the mess hall became
the stage for exceptionally spirited banter and wild conjecture as to what would
happen on the morrow. Confidential battle orders carried the information that
artillery preparation would begin at midnight, continuing with great
concentration until 5:30 a.m., zero hour, when the attacking forces of nine
American divisions would storm over the top in the beginning of a titanic
struggle to carry the famous Hindenburg Line and sweep the Germans back through
the Argonne and beyond the Meuse.

Every fighting unit had been given comprehensive plans of the objectives and
of the ground over which they were to advance. The air units were especially
drilled in the battle plans, for Great Headquarters would look to the
Observation section and to the pursuit planes for a full measure of information
as to how the battle went.

Major Cowan       s pursuit group was only one of the <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>236many ready to begin operations on this
new front, but none could have shown more enthusiasm and eager expectancy than
did this group of young men who wolfed down their evening meal and jested in a
strained, light-hearted manner that betrayed the nerve tension under which they
were laboring. To-morrow morning was the start of the Big Show!

All the pilots were present at this meal save Siddons, who had taken off
alone, in a two-seater, a few minutes before sundown. He had let it be known
that he was reporting to Observation for special duty, and no one seemed sorry
to see him go.

The evening meal was scarcely finished when McGee and Larkin were forced to
withdraw from the good-natured kidding match by a summons to report to Major
Cowan. They obeyed, grumbling, and with heated, spirited contention that they
were beyond doubt the most command-ridden lieutenants in the entire A.E.F.

       He wants to spend half the night with those maps all of us have been
getting goggle-eyed over for the last two days,        Larkin complained as they
approached Cowan       s hut.        He       s a map hound, if there ever was
one! I think that bird knows every trench line, strong point, pill box and
artillery P.C., between here and Sedan. And so do I! He       s pounded it into
my head.       

       I wish I knew as much,        McGee quickly resigned <span
class='pagenum pncolor'>237himself.        This
drive is all so sudden and unexpected, to me, that I hardly know where I am
right now. I       ve an idea the Old Man is going to tell me I can       t go
along.       

       Don       t worry, fellow,        Larkin told him, pausing at the
Major       s door.        Every guy with two arms, two legs and two eyes will
be along on this little fracas. Believe me, this is to be some show!       

As they entered they noticed that Cowan stood with his back to the door,
bending over a large map spread out on the table.

       What did I tell you?        Larkin whispered to McGee.
       We       re in for a session of night map flying.       

McGee did not hear him. His interest was upon a sergeant and four privates
who were seated on a bench against the wall just to the right of the door. He
noted that they wore side arms only, and that on their sleeves were the blue and
white brassards of the Military Police. M.P., eh? Then something was up!

Cowan turned from his map.        Ah, you are here. Sergeant,        he
addressed the non-com in charge of the detail,        post your detail just
outside the door and wait. If anyone approaches with a       ah       prisoner,
admit them.       

       Yes, sir.        The detail filed out.

Cowan saw the look of question on the faces of the two pilots.

       You are wondering why they are here, eh? Well, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>238they have been sent down from Corps
Headquarters to take charge of a prisoner. We hope to hold a little reception
here within a short time       possibly any minute now.       

       Who is to be honored, Major?        Larkin asked.

       A rather well known gentleman,        Cowan replied, tantalizingly.
       Both of you are quite well acquainted with Lieutenant Siddons, I
believe?       

Larkin looked at McGee in astonishment.

       No, sir,        McGee replied to Cowan,        no one in this outfit
knows that fellow very well.       

       Quite right,        Cowan agreed.        Lieutenant Larkin, I recall
that you lost your old R.F.C. uniform a good while back.       

       Yes, sir.       

       And in the pocket was your old identification fold, and certain other
papers? An old pass to Paris, for one thing?       

       Why       yes, sir. The identification card was there, but I
don       t recall what I did with that old pass.       

       It was there,        Cowan told him,        and it grieves me to
inform you that the uniform, and all that the pockets contained, was stolen by
Lieutenant Siddons.       

       What! Are you sure?       

       There is no doubt about it. Furthermore, he delivered them into the
hands of the enemy.        <a
id='page_239'>239Larkin was too dumbfounded for words, but McGee
displayed little surprise.

       So you have at last found out what I knew all along, Major?        Red
asked.

       Not at last,        Cowan replied, with meaning emphasis.
       Your uniform, Lieutenant Larkin, will be returned to you soon       we
hope.       

       Oh!        McGee jerked his head toward the door.        So
that       s the reason for the M.P.       s. You are going to nab
him?       

       Not exactly that.        Cowan was enjoying the curiosity provoked by
the suspense he was creating.        I believe both of you have heard of a
certain German ace, Count von Herzmann?       

       Have we!        Larkin replied.

McGee ran his fingers along a white scar still showing through the hair which
had not yet grown out long enough to be the flaming red mop of old.

       Seems I       ve heard of him,        he said.        And I seem to
recall that one of his flyers left me this little souvenir on the top of my
head. I       d like to pay the Count back       in person.       

       You       ll never get the chance!        Cowan replied.        But if
all our plans work out, you will meet him in person soon       in this very
room!       

       What!        It was a duet of surprise.

       Yes, here. Count von Herzmann in person       and in Lieutenant
Larkin       s long lost uniform.       

240Both McGee and
Larkin sank weakly into two convenient chairs, the expression on their faces
disclosing that they were trying to select the proper order of the first of a
thousand questions.

       Well       what       s that to do with       with Siddons?       
McGee at last found stammering tongue.        Where does he come in?       

       He comes in a few minutes after the Count. He will land the Count in a
field near here, let him alight, and then take off again and proceed to this
       drome. The Count, left alone, will doubtless make his way into the woods
bordering the field, where he will promptly be nabbed. That little drama should
be taking place now. For your information, the credit for this coup goes to
Lieutenant Siddons.       

McGee and Larkin stared at each other, scarce believing their ears.

       Well what do you know about that!        McGee       s half audible
remark was the trite expression so commonly used by those who are staggered by a
sudden revelation.

       I know all about it,        Cowan said, actually
laughing       the first time either of the others had ever heard him even so
much as chuckle.        I know all about it, and I       ve called you here for
two reasons: I think you, McGee, are entitled to see the next to the last act in
this little       ah       tragedy, I suppose it should be called; and I want
Larkin to be present when his <a
id='page_241'>241 uniform reappears. I might need him for purposes of
identification.       

       But              

Cowan lifted a protesting hand.        Don       t ask questions. Better let
me tell it. The story will have to be brief, and a bit sketchy, for time flies.
The things you don       t know about all this would fill a book. Perhaps I had
better start at the beginning:

       In 1914, when the war first broke out, the man you know as Siddons was
living in Germany, with his father and mother, and was in his second year in a
Berlin university. He was born in America, of German-American parents. For your
information, his right name is Schwarz, not Siddons.       

       I always thought he looked like a German,        McGee said.

Cowan merely nodded.        Naturally, he does. His father, who had come to
America in his youth to escape four years military service with the colors,
developed into an exceedingly shrewd business man and had been sent back to
Germany as the Berlin representative of one of our large exporters. Though he
had become an American citizen, he was, quite naturally, genuinely sympathetic
with Germany as against England and France. But when it began to be almost a
certainty that America would be drawn into the war, the Schwarz family held a
family conference and the old man declared himself as being <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>242loyal to America, his adopted country,
if war actually came.

       During the months of strained relationship between our country and
Germany, the Schwarz family had to keep their mouths shut and saw wood. Then,
suddenly, America declared war. Many Americans, and German-Americans, were
caught in Germany. This was the case of the Schwarz family. The old gentleman
was arrested, in fact, and the military authorities claimed that since he had
never served with the colors he was subject to their orders.

       Then young Schwarz       the man you know as Siddons       saw a
chance to relieve the pressure and at the same time serve America in a most
unusual way, a way not possible with one man in a million.       

       Serve America? You mean Germany?        Larkin interjected.

       I said America,        Cowan replied testily. He did not like to be
interrupted.        You       d better let me tell it my way. As I was saying,
Siddons, claiming to be in complete sympathy with the German cause, offered his
services to them as a secret agent, unfolding a plan which they, in their alarm
and need, swallowed       hook, line and sinker.

       The plan was this: He proposed that he be given instruction in secret
service work and then be returned to America, where he would pose as a loyal
American, get in the army, and serve as an under <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>243cover man for Germany. They fell for it
like a ton of brick, following the stupid reasoning that because of his German
blood he must by nature be truly German. It may sound funny to you, but they
preach that very thing, and they truly believe it.

       Well, certainly young Schwarz was cast perfectly for the role. He was
widely travelled, spoke German fluently, and his English was flawless. They were
quick to see the advantages. His proposition was accepted. He was given a brief
schooling in their spy system, and then, for show, he was ordered out of
Germany       under the fictitious name of Siddons.

       The rest was easy. We had a very poor spy system at the beginning of
the war. There was no such branch of service as we now call G2. But it was
forming, and to them Schwarz made his way, unfolded his plan, and after a
careful checking up on his story they decided to take a chance. A spy within a
spy! Wheels within wheels! It was a great idea. Do you see it?       

His two auditors made no sign other than a staring, amazed look.

       G2 was at first suspicious,        Cowan went on,        but he gave
them so much information concerning actual conditions in Germany that they could
no longer doubt him. They sent him to an aviation training school, telling him
to guard his neck at all times and not run any undue risks.

244       You know
the rest       or most of it. He has been invaluable to us, and to-night he will
pull his greatest job. And since I have made free to tell you all this, you may
be certain it is his last trip across the lines. He reports that the German High
Command is getting a bit suspicious, and he dare not trust his luck much
further.       

McGee, who had been listening with intense interest, exhaled audibly as Cowan
finished his narration.        Well!        he exclaimed.        I       ll
never jump to conclusions again. Now I know why that fellow has always acted
like he was answerable to no one but himself. And I thought him yellow! And next
I thought he was a spy. Well, I was right about that       but the wrong way
around. I take my hat off to him! It takes nerve to fill his job.       

       It does indeed!        Cowan agreed fervently.        Perhaps you
recall how I bawled him out for cutting formation over Vitry that day when we
were on our way up for our first action? And how I sent him over the lines on a
mission to locate von Herzmann       s Circus?       

McGee nodded.        I certainly do remember it. You sure said
plenty!       

       Hokum! All hokum!        Cowan said.        Actually, he was going
over on a daylight mission of an entirely different nature, and what I said in
your presence was merely to mislead you. Unfortunately, you happened <span
class='pagenum pncolor'>245to see him running the
Archie fire and saw the signals which he had used again and again in crossing
over. When you reported to me, we feared the cat was out of the bag. There
seemed to be only one way out       to pledge you to secrecy and lead you to
believe that we were simply waiting for the proper time to bag him. I knew you
would keep your word, and that is another reason why you are here       as a
sort of reward. You are the only one who has ever had any such
suspicions.       

Larkin laughed, mirthlessly.        That makes a lot of chuckle-heads out of
the rest of us, doesn       t it?       

       Oh, I wouldn       t say that, Lieutenant. But you did make life
rather hard for Siddons. He was afraid to form close friendships. Poor Hampden
was the only one he was ever very close to, and Hampden was as ignorant of the
facts as any of you. Siddons had to be careful. He knows that the Germans also
have spies. Should they get proof of his duplicity, he would be a doomed
man.       

       Well,        McGee sighed again,        he can have my share of that
kind of service. I prefer to meet mine without any blindfold over my eyes.
I       ll make my apologies to him, and admit to his face that he has more
nerve than most men I know. But there is one thing I can       t get through my
head, Major. How could he keep fooling them if he never took them any
information?       

246       He did
take them information. But it was always so cleverly false       just near
enough the truth that he could hardly be blamed for not having it more
accurate       or else it was the real truth but too late to be of any value to
them. You can be sure we gained by his work.       

       One more question from me, Major,        Larkin spoke up.        What
makes you so sure that Count von Herzmann              

The door was thrown open by a helmeted, muddy doughboy sergeant from the
lines. Then into the room, followed by the mud-spattered doughboy and the M.P.
detail, walked a smiling, confident, blond young man, attired in the uniform of
a member of the British Air Forces.

The suddenness and surprise of the movement started the ends of Cowan       s
moustache to twitching.

       Sir,        spoke up the muddy infantryman,        here       s that
bozo we all been lookin        for.       

Major Cowan arose.        Count von Herzmann, I believe?        he said as
calmly as though it were a social meeting.

The prisoner lifted his eyebrows in well feigned surprise.        There is
some dreadful mistake here, Major,        he said with a calm assurance as he
took from his pocket a small identification fold, bound in black leather.
       I am              

       Just a moment,        the Major interrupted.        Permit <span
class='pagenum pncolor'>247me first to introduce one
of these gentlemen. Count von Herzmann, this is Lieutenant Richard Larkin, whose
uniform you are now wearing and whose identification card you hold in your hand.
I am sure you are glad to meet him.       

For the briefest moment von Herzmann       s mouth dropped open. He knew the
jig was up! Almost immediately, however, he regained the debonair, easy grace of
a splendidly poised loser. He bowed to Larkin, who stood with mouth agape and
eyes popping out.

       I am indebted to Lieutenant Larkin for the use of his uniform,       
von Herzmann said.        I regret that it will probably be returned to him with
bullet holes in it. Oh, well       such is war, eh? Perhaps he can find some
satisfaction in keeping it as a souvenir. He can point to the holes and say,
       Count von Herzmann, the German ace and spy, was just behind these
holes.              

Every man in the room felt awed and a trifle uneasy. Here was a man whose
cool courage they could envy. Not every man can face death with so grim a
jest.

       However,        von Herzmann turned to Cowan,        it gives me
pleasure to report that I foresaw the possibility of this very thing and so
arranged matters that a certain Mr. Schwarz, whom you call Siddons, will be shot
five days from now.       

<a
id='page_248'>248       What!        Cowan stormed. He wheeled to the
sergeant.        Sergeant, where did this man              

       The sergeant doesn       t know,        von Herzmann put in.        He
is the third man in whose charge I have been placed. Perhaps you had better let
me tell you, Major. Your planes are quite wretched and inferior, sir, and when
the engine of the one I was making use of died suddenly, we were forced to land
quickly and take what the Fates had in store. We struck an old shell hole,
turned over, and my pilot was killed, poor fellow! Too bad it wasn       t the
other way round. He wore his own uniform, and could hardly have been shot as a
spy.       

Cowan sank into a chair, rather heavily. His poise was no match for von
Herzmann       s, who seemed to be getting a keen delight out of the
Major       s discomfiture.

       I was not at the controls,        von Herzmann continued,        but
the engine sputtered as though it were out of fuel.       

Major Cowan nodded his head sadly.        It was. Poor Siddons was
right,        he mused, seemingly unconscious for the moment of the presence of
the others.

       Only half right,        von Herzmann corrected, smiling.

       No,        Cowan replied with spirit,        all right. He
feared you might become suspicious and double-cross him, and with that in mind
he put just enough gas in <a
id='page_249'>249 the tank to carry the plane there and part way
back. He made rather careful tests. But he installed another tank, with a feed
line that he could cut in       in case he were flying the plane. If
not       well, you see what happened.       

Count von Herzmann merely shrugged his shoulders at this piece of news which
must have been irritating in the extreme.        Ah, well,        he said
easily,        one cannot think of everything. In our haste to get away, neither
I nor my pilot thought of that possibility. Very clever fellow, this man
Schwarz. We both made good guesses, and we both lose. Kismet! We both serve our
country, and we both get shot. So be it. Wars are very old, Major; death quite
as common as life; and the old Hebraic law still operative              an eye for an
eye and a tooth for a tooth!        In this case, an ace for an ace and a spy
for a spy. Even up, and the war rolls on. I wonder, Major, just when it will
close?       

Seemingly, as in answer to his question, from toward the front came the
sudden roaring of thousands of guns. Doors rattled, the ground quivered, and
through the window the sky was alight with a pulsating red-white glare.

For a few minutes every man in the room stood listening.

       What is       that?        Count von Herzmann asked at last.

250       The
beginning of the end,        Cowan answered.        You wondered when it would
come. Soon now. Nearly five thousand heavy calibre guns are blowing your
trenches to bits, and will continue until we go over in the morning.       

       So?        The German       s face was a picture of pained surprise.
       So the attack comes here? Gott! Had I known       had
we known.        He paused, obviously pained, then again resumed his
jesting poise.        You can be sure, Major, that I regret I am not on the
receiving end of your artillery preparation and that I shall be unable to meet
your squadron with my Circus to-morrow morning over the lines.       

       I dare say,        was Cowan       s reply as he turned to the
sergeant in charge of the Military Police detail.        Sergeant, take charge
of the prisoner and deliver him to First Corps Headquarters. And make sure that
he does not escape.       

The sergeant saluted, grinning expansively.

       He       s got a fat chance to get away from me, sir,        he
said.        I       m the spy bustin       est baby in this man       s
army.       

       You will treat him with courtesy,        Cowan ordered.        He is a
brave man.       

       Yes, sir,        the sergeant replied.        So was Nathan Hale,
sir       but he got shot just the same.       


251CHAPTER XIIIThe Last of the Big Shows


1


The following morning had no dawning. A light rain had fallen during the
night and a heavy, obliterating fog arose from the wet earth, blanketing hill
and valley alike. So dense was it that troops in the front lines, peeping over
the top in anxious nervousness as they awaited the zero hour, saw nothing but a
wall of white that made the shell-tortured land before them more mysterious than
any dream of battle ever fancied.

What did it hold? Where were the German lines? And just what had been the
effect of this five hour tornado of screaming shells?

Machine guns, under cover of the fog, were boldly mounted on the trench
parapets. They danced and chattered on their tripods as they pounded forth
streams of lead upon the unseen enemy positions.

Zero hour at last! Along the line officers blew shrill whistles, or some,
calmer than the others, gave the signal with a confidently shouted,
       Let       s go!       

Over the trench tops poured thousands of khaki <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>252clad warriors, sallying forth in the
most resolute endeavor ever attempted by American troops.

They had not advanced ten feet from the trenches before the fog swallowed
them, magically, and many were never to retrace their steps. The big show they
had so long waited for was here with an ear-splitting, nerve-racking tempest of
thundering guns. The Big Parade!


2


At any other time the air forces would have stayed safely at home, not daring
to take wing on such a day when the ceiling was scarcely higher than a
man       s head. But now they must go out, at any cost, blindly flying and
vainly seeking some view of the advancing troops. But they went out singly, for
to attempt formation flight on such a morning would be to court disaster and
death.

McGee and Larkin were the first of the squadron to take off for the front,
the interval between their time of departure being sufficient to avoid any
meeting as they climbed.

The fog bank was much thicker than McGee had anticipated. At a hundred feet
he could not see a thing above, below, or on either side. He headed his new
ship, a swift Spad, in the direction of Vauquois Hill, intending to cross the
line there and hoping that <a
id='page_253'>253the crest of the hill might loom up out of the
fog.

Vain hope. It was impossible to see a thing. Any minute he might go plowing
into some hillside or foul his landing gear in the tops of trees. It was eerie
business, this flying by instinct and facing the dreaded possibility of coming a
cropper.

Several times he cut his motor, and at such times could hear the din of
battle below       and it was not any too far below, either.

Added to the fear of crashing was the thought that any second he might cross
the path of a high angle shell which had been directed at some enemy strong
point. It was not a pleasant thought, but he could not shake it off. Certainly
the air was full of them, and if he was to get any information as to the
progress of the battle he must keep low and accept all hazards. Then too, there
was the chance that he might meet up with some other plane drilling through the
fog.

       Well,        he thought aloud,        I       m a poor prune if I lose
my nerve now. I expressed my opinion of Siddons       and gee! how he       d
like to be facing no more than this.       

It was a depressing, angering thought. Five days, von Herzmann had said. Then
Siddons would face a firing squad. In the meantime, there was no human agency,
on the Allied side of the line, that could stop the inexorable march of time and
the certain death which this man must meet.

254It was this
latter fact, the feeling of helpless impotency, that fired McGee       s brain
with reckless daring and sent him boring through the fog like an angry
hornet.

He soon found that this was of no avail and at last, seeking something that
might be of value, he climbed out of the earth-blanketing fog into the clear
sunlight, encountering clear blue sky at some fifteen hundred feet.

Below him, now, was a billowing sea of fog banks, tinted by the sun which had
climbed about it. A short distance ahead he sighted an enemy tri-plane Fokker,
but before he could give chase it had dived into the fog.

Over to the right, in what he thought must be the general direction of
Montfaucon, he saw a single seater Nieuport cruising around.

He headed for it, and soon identified it as Yancey       s plane. The wild
Texan was sitting above the fog, patiently waiting (as a cat waits for a mouse)
for some observation sausage to come nosing out of the fog. Tex knew that the
sun would eventually burn up the fog. The enemy, also knowing this, would be
sending up their sausages so as to have them in position when the fog passed.
Certainly the enemy had reason to see all that could be seen, for by this time
they must be hard pressed indeed.

Directly in McGee       s path, about half way between <span class='pagenum
pncolor'>255his plane and Yancey       s, a black,
formless bulk loomed out of the fog. A sausage!

McGee drove hard for it, and noted that he was in a race with Yancey, whose
quick eye had sighted it.

The black bag was hardly out of the fog bank when tracers from McGee       s
and Yancey       s guns began streaming into it. It exploded with amazing
suddenness, the flaming cloth sinking back into enveloping billows of fog.

Yancey banked sharply, flew alongside McGee and shook his fist as though to
say              Go and find a rat hole of your own. This is my
territory.       

McGee chuckled. The Texan, instead of trying to catch some view of the far
flung battle lines, was out to increase his score.

McGee dived back down into the fog, hoping that it might be lifting. Down
below, he knew, a mighty struggle was on. Lines of communication would be shot
all to pieces in the rain of heavy shells. Great Headquarters would be waiting
anxiously for some news of the real status and progress of the battle.

At 8:30 the fog was still holding over the field and McGee reluctantly turned
his ship homeward.

By that sixth sense which the seasoned pilot has, or develops, he found the
field. No one had been able to catch sight of the ground forces.

Cowan was storming around, under pressure from headquarters.

<a
id='page_256'>256       It       s information we want,        he
told the pilots as they came in,        not a tale of what can       t be done.
Get back over the lines. This fog will pass. This is not a job for an hour.
Headquarters wants information. Get it!       

To McGee, he said, with something of a sting in his voice,        Considering
the chances Siddons used to take, I       d think this squadron       his own
group       would be equal to this task.       

It was a lash. Furious, yet realizing the justice of the taunt, McGee again
took off, determined not to come back until he could bring some real news of the
battle       s progress.


3


That was the longest, hardest day ever put in by American aviators. They had
little trouble in gaining and holding air supremacy, but they had a most
difficult time, when the fog finally lifted, in getting any accurate
information.

The advance had been so rapid, and so successful, that the Hindenburg Line
had been carried by the soldiers in the first few hours of battle. But in
pressing forward, in the fog, they had been unable to keep in close liaison.
Instead of being a well-knit whole, they were little more than a storming,
victory-drunk mob. They stopped at nothing       and nothing could stop <span
class='pagenum pncolor'>257them. As for displaying
their white muslin panels to airplanes so that their positions might be
known       poof! They were too busy to fool around with panels and those dizzy
air birds who never did anything but fly around and look for panels. Panels be
hanged! This was a day for doughboys and the bayonet!


4


That night, after mess, the members of the squadron sat around in glum
silence. The success of the day, with reference to gains, was great indeed, but
Cowan was riding with whip and spur. He seemed not at all pleased with the work
of his own group. Added to this, word had gone around of the dramatic happenings
of the previous night, with the result that Siddons, the most disliked man in
the squadron, had suddenly become their mourned hero. Even now they counted him
as dead, for one precious day had already slipped away and nothing in the world
could save him. The success of the day seemed as nothing by the side of this
tragic fact. Not the least distressing thought was the fact that they had
treated him as one who had never earned the right to a full fellowship with
them. And now they knew, too late, that he was a man of surpassing courage. They
even learned, from Cowan, how Siddons, working with the French, had plotted
trapping von Herzmann that day <a
id='page_258'>258when the squadron was attacked for the first time.
The lucky arrival of the French Spads, they now knew, was not a matter of luck
at all, but a daring plan to overwhelm the greedy German war eagle and rid the
air of him. Yes, Siddons had courage and brains. There was no longer any doubt
of that.

Yancey voiced the thoughts of every man present when he said:        It
wouldn       t be so tough if he could get it in the air. But this way       at
a wall       is tough.       

       What about von Herzmann?        Fouche asked.        I guess it was
tough for him, too.       

Yancey grinned and scratched his head.        You know,        he drawled,
       down in my home state, we sometimes make a mistake and slap a brand on a
calf that       s not really ours. Well, that       s not so awful. But when
somebody else makes the same mistake, it       s stealin              pure and
simple. War       s a lot like that. We only see one side of it, and for my
part, I       m fed up with seein        that side. Boy, I hone for
Texas.       


5


McGee and Larkin, as flight leaders, had been called to Major Cowan       s
headquarters for the usual evening conference. The Major declared himself as
displeased with the work of the day, but both of the young pilots, experienced
in the ways of the army, realized that Cowan       s displeasure was but a
reaction 259from
pressure being put on him by the        higher ups.        The General Staff,
they knew, must be gratified with the success of the day, for all objectives had
been taken and the enemy sorely pressed. It was true, however, that
communication had been far from perfect. Liaison had broken down, and the ground
gained, therefore, was the result of the grim determination of the soldier of
the line to end the thing speedily rather than to a perfect coordination of all
arms.

       But, Major,        McGee was defending the work of the squadron by
pointing out the unusual and unforeseen obstacles,        we couldn       t see
our wing tips until after nine o       clock, and when we could see, those
doughboys wouldn       t display their panels. They acted like they thought we
would drop bombs on them. It       s hard, Major, to get men to show white
panels when they are under fire. They are afraid that the enemy will see them,
too, and blow them off the face of the earth. It is always a hard
problem.       

       All battle problems are hard,        Cowan replied.        The
commanders of the troops in the line are being ridden just as we are. The
General Staff feels that victory is in sight. They will accept nothing but the
best of work, and we must do our full share.       

       Yes, sir, of course. But I think the troops are to be congratulated
for their success, and certainly this outfit was lucky in that we didn       t
hang any planes on <a
id='page_260'>260the top of Vauquois or in the woods. Four balloons
and three E.A. is not such a bad record for a day like this. We held complete
supremacy.       

       Congratulations will be in order after a complete success, Lieutenant.
Now for to-morrow       here, see this map.        Larkin winked shrewdly as
Cowan led them over to a detailed wall map.        The lines of departure are
here. Our most advanced positions, now, as near as we can tell, are well beyond
the Hindenburg Line, with the Hagen Stellung line of defense facing our troops
to-morrow. Montfaucon, the enemy       s strongest point, and for months
headquarters for the Crown Prince, blocks the way for the 5th Corps. It is a
commanding and strong position. No one knows just how strong it is.       

       Pardon me,        a voice came from directly behind them,        but I
know a great deal about its strength.       

So interested had they been, that they had not heard anyone enter. At sound
of the voice they wheeled around. There stood Siddons, mud from head to foot but
smiling expansively.

       Siddons!        Cowan exclaimed.        You?       

       Yes, sir       fortunately.       

All three of the startled men rushed forward to wring his hand. There was a
hubbub of excited talk and exclamations of surprise, with no chance for the mind
to put forth logical questions. Cowan was the first to gain some degree of
composure.

261       Heavens,
man! How did you get here?       

       Crawled, walked and ran, and the last few miles in a side car,       
Siddons replied.        Last night, at midnight, I was being held at Montfaucon
under the trumped up pretext that a staff officer was on his way down to see me
and that I was to take off with von Herzmann later in the night. But I knew that
von Herzmann had taken off with another pilot, and I knew that the jig was up.
They weren       t accusing me of anything       as yet       but they were very
quiet and their manner told me all I needed to know. Then, bing! the barrage
opened up. It was some surprise. They hadn       t the foggiest notion that a
blow was to be struck here. Almost the first pop out of the box that long range
railway rifle at Neuvilly dropped one of those big G.I. cans just outside of
headquarters. There was a grand scramble for the deep dugouts. You never saw so
many High Ones streaking it for safety.

       I made tracks too, but I missed the dugout door       by design!
Pretty soon another big shell came along and flopped down near the same place,
but by that time I was a long ways from there and going strong.

       The night was as dark as the inside of a whale, but the glare of light
from the guns on our side gave me direction. The rest was comparatively
easy.       

       Easy!        Cowan exclaimed.        How in the world did you get
across the line?       

262       Major,
the confusion was so great, due to that barrage, that I could have led an
elephant up to the line with no one taking the time to challenge me. You forget
that my German is quite good. On a dark night, well covered by a German
officer       s coat, which I borrowed from a chap who won       t ever need it
again, it was not a difficult feat. Believe me, my biggest worry was that I
would get sent west by one of our own shells. When I reached the front line I
crawled in a funk hole and waited for dawning and for our own troops to come
along. And when they started, man! how they came! The enemy is completely
disorganized, Major, and victory will be ours within a month or six weeks. Maybe
sooner. The Germans know it. Montfaucon will fall to-morrow. This is the last of
the big shows.       

He paused, and his eyes, which McGee had always thought so cold, twinkled
with merriment.

       By the way,        he said,        at Division Headquarters of the
79th, where I made a report and was given transportation back here, the
Intelligence Officer told me a spy was nabbed last night       a chap by the
name of von Herzmann. Plane forced down, the officer told me. I wonder if it
could be possible that he ran out of gas?       

       Yes,        Cowan replied, catching the spirit of the banter,
       he ran out of gas.       

       Tut! tut!        Siddons mockingly reproved.        Wasn       t that
a careless thing for a great ace to do?

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
