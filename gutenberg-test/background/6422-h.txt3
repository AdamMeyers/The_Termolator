      PREFACE
    
    
      That all Defoe's novels, with the exception of "Robinson Crusoe," should
      have been covered with the dust of neglect for many generations, is a
      plain proof of how much fashions in taste affect the popularity of the
      British classics. It is true that three generations or so ago, Defoe's
      works were edited by both Sir Walter Scott and Hazlitt, and that this
      masterly piece of realism, "Captain Singleton," was reprinted a few years
      back in "The Camelot Classics," but it is safe to say that out of every
      thousand readers of "Robinson Crusoe" only one or two will have even heard
      of the "Memoirs of a Cavalier," "Colonel Jack," "Moll Flanders," or
      "Captain Singleton." It is indeed distressing to think that while many
      scores of thousands of copies of Lord Lytton's flashy romance, "Paul
      Clifford," have been devoured by the public, "Captain Singleton" has
      remained unread and almost forgotten. But the explanation is simple.
      Defoe's plain and homely realism soon grew to be thought vulgar by people
      who themselves aspired to be refined and genteel. The rapid spread of
      popular education, in the middle of last century, was responsible for a
      great many aberrations of taste, and the works of the two most English of
      Englishmen, Defoe and Hogarth, were judged to be hardly fitting for polite
      society, as we may see from Lamb's Essay on Hogarth, and from an early
      edition of Chambers's "Cyclopaedia of English Literature" (1843), where we
      are told: "Nor is it needful to show how elegant and reflective
      literature, especially, tends to moralise, to soften, and to adorn the
      soul and life of man." "Unfortunately the taste or circumstances of
      Defoe led him mostly into low life, and his characters are such as
      we cannot sympathise with. The whole arcana of roguery and villany
      seems to have been open to him.... It might be thought that the good taste
      which led Defoe to write in a style of such pure and unpretending English,
      instead of the inflated manner of vulgar writers, would have dictated a
      more careful selection of his subjects, and kept him from wandering so
      frequently into the low and disgusting purlieus of vice. But this moral
      and tasteful discrimination seems to have been wholly wanting,"      c.
      The 'forties were the days when critics still talked learnedly of the
      "noble style,"      c., "the vulgar," of "sinking" or "rising" with "the
      subject," the days when Books of Beauty were in fashion, and Rembrandt's
      choice of beggars, wrinkled faces and grey hairs, for his favourite
      subjects seemed a low and reprehensible taste in "high art." Though
      critics to-day still ingenuously confound an artist's subject with his
      treatment of it, and prefer scenes of life to be idealised rather than
      realised by writers, we have advanced a little since the days of the poet
      Montgomery, and it would be difficult now to find anybody writing so
      confidently       "Unfortunately the taste or circumstances of Defoe led
      him mostly into low life," however much the critic might believe it. But
      let us glance at a few passages in "Captain Singleton," which may show us
      why Defoe excels as a realist, and why his descriptions of "low life" are
      artistically as perfect as any descriptions of "higher life" in the works
      of the English novelists. Take the following description of kidnapping:       
    

  "The woman pretending to take me up in her arms and kiss me, and
  play with me, draws the girl a good way from the house, till at
  last she makes a fine story to the girl, and bids her go back to
  the maid, and tell her where she was with the child; that a
  gentlewoman had taken a fancy to the child and was kissing it, but
  she should not be frightened, or to that purpose; for they were
  but just there; and so while the girl went, she carried me quite
  away.       Page 2.

    
      Now here, in a single sentence, Defoe catches for us the whole soul and
      character of the situation. It seems very simple, but it sums up
      marvellously an exact observation and knowledge of the arts of the gipsy
      child-stealer, of her cunning flattery and brassy boldness, and we can see
      the simple little girl running back to the house to tell the nurse that a
      fine lady was kissing the child, and had told her to tell where they were
      and she should not be frightened,      c.; and this picture again calls up
      the hue and cry after the kidnappers and the fruitless hopes of the
      parents. In a word, Defoe has condensed in the eight simple lines of his
      little scene all that is essential to its living truth; and let the young
      writer note that it is ever the sign of the master to do in three words,
      or with three strokes, what the ordinary artist does in thirty. Defoe's
      imagination is so extraordinarily comprehensive in picking out just those
      little matter-of-fact details that suggest all the other aspects, and that
      emphasise the character of the scene or situation, that he makes us
      believe in the actuality of whatever he is describing. So real, so living
      in every detail is this apocryphal narrative, in "Captain Singleton," of
      the crossing of Africa by a body of marooned sailors from the coast of
      Mozambique to the Gold Coast, that one would firmly believe Defoe was
      committing to writing the verbal narrative of some adventurer in the
      flesh, if it were not for certain passages       such as the description
      of the impossible desert on page 90, which proves that Defoe was piecing
      together his description of an imaginary journey from the geographical
      records and travellers' tales of his contemporaries, aided perhaps by the
      confused yarns of some sailor friends. How substantially truthful in
      spirit and in detail is Defoe's account of Madagascar is proved by the
      narrative of Robert Drury's "Captivity in Madagascar," published in 1729.
      The natives themselves, as described intimately by Drury, who lived
      amongst them for many years, would produce just such an effect as Defoe
      describes on rough sailors in their perilous position. The method by which
      Defoe compels us to accept improbabilities, and lulls our critical sense
      asleep, is well shown in the following passages:       
    

  "Thieving, lying, swearing, forswearing, joined to the most
  abominable lewdness, was the stated practice of the ship's crew;
  adding to it, that with the most unsufferable boasts of their own
  courage, they were, generally speaking, the most complete cowards
  that I ever met with."       Page 7.

  "All the seamen in a body came up to the rail of the quarter-deck,
  where the captain was walking with some of his officers, and
  appointing the boatswain to speak for them, he went up, and falling
  on his knees to the captain, begged of him in the humblest manner
  possible, to receive the four men on board again, offering to answer
  for their fidelity, or to have them kept in chains, till they came
  to Lisbon, and there to be delivered up to justice, rather than, as
  they said, to have them left, to be murdered by savages, or devoured
  by wild beasts. It was a great while ere the captain took any notice
  of them, but when he did, he ordered the boatswain to be seized, and
  threatened to bring him to the capstan for speaking for them....
  Upon this severity, one of the seamen, bolder than the rest, but
  still with all possible respect to the captain, besought his honour,
  as he called him, that he would give leave to some more of them to
  go on shore, and die with their companions, or, if possible, to
  assist them to resist the barbarians."       Page 18.

    
      Now the first passage we have quoted about the cowardice,      c., of the
      Portuguese crew is not in keeping with the second passage, which shows the
      men as "wishing to die with their companions"; but so actual is the scene
      of the seamen "in a body coming up to the rail of the quarter-deck," that
      we cannot but believe the thing happened so, just as we believe in all the
      thousand little details of the imaginary narrative of "Robinson Crusoe."
      This feat of the imagination Defoe strengthens in the most artful manner,
      by putting in the mouths of his characters various reflections to
      substantiate the narrative. For example, in the description, on page 263,
      of the savages who lined the perilous channel in a half-moon, where the
      European ship lay, we find the afterthoughts are added so naturally, that
      they would carry conviction to any judge or jury:       
    

  "They little thought what service they had done us, and how
  unwittingly, and by the greatest ignorance, they had made
  themselves pilots to us, while we, having not sounded the place,
  might have been lost before we were aware. It is true we might
  have sounded our new harbour, before we had ventured out; but I
  cannot say for certain, whether we should or not; for I, for my
  part, had not the least suspicion of what our real case was;
  however, I say, perhaps, before we had weighed, we should have
  looked about us a little."

    
      Turning to the other literary qualities that make Defoe's novels great, if
      little read, classics, how delightful are the little satiric touches that
      add grave weight to the story. Consider the following: "My good gipsy
      mother, for some of her worthy actions, no doubt, happened in process of
      time to be hanged, and as this fell out something too soon for me to be
      perfected in the strolling trade,"      c.(p. 3). Every other word here is
      dryly satiric, and the large free callousness and careless brutality of
      Defoe's days with regard to the life of criminals is conveyed in half a
      sentence. And what an amount of shrewd observation is summed up in this
      one saying: "Upon these foundations, William said he was satisfied we
      might trust them; for, says William, I would as soon trust a man whose
      interest binds him to be just to me, as a man whose principle binds
      himself" (p. 227). Extremely subtle is also this remark: "Why, says I,
      did you ever know a pirate repent? At this he started a little and
      returned, At the gallows I have known one repent, and I hope
      thou wilt be the second." The character of William the Quaker pirate is a
      masterpiece of shrewd humour. He is the first Quaker brought into English
      fiction, and we know of no other Friend in latter-day fiction to equal
      him. Defoe in his inimitable manner has defined surely and deftly the
      peculiar characteristics of the sect in this portrait. On three separate
      occasions we find William saving unfortunate natives or defenceless
      prisoners from the cruel and wicked barbarity of the sailors. At page 183,
      for example, the reader will find a most penetrating analysis of the dense
      stupidity which so often accompanies man's love of bloodshed. The sketch
      of the second lieutenant, who was for "murdering the negroes to make them
      tell," when he could not make them even understand what he wanted, is
      worthy of Tolstoy. We have not space here to dwell upon the scores of
      passages of similar deep insight which make "Captain Singleton" a most
      true and vivid commentary on the life of Defoe's times, but we may call
      special attention to the passage on page 189 which describe the sale of
      the negroes to the planters; to the description of the awakening of the
      conscience of Captain Singleton through terror at the fire-cloud (page
      222); and to the extraordinarily picturesque conversation between William
      and the captive Dutchman (page 264). Finally, if the reader wishes to
      taste Defoe's flavour in its perfection let him examine carefully those
      passages in the concluding twenty pages of the book, wherein Captain
      Singleton is shown as awakening to the wickedness of his past life, and
      the admirable dry reasoning of William by which the Quaker prevents him
      from committing suicide and persuades him to keep his ill-gotten wealth,
      "with a resolution to do what right with it we are able; and who knows
      what opportunity Providence may put into our hands.... As it is without
      doubt, our present business is to go to some place of safety, where we may
      wait His will." How admirable is the passage about William's sister, the
      widow with four children who kept a little shop in the Minories, and that
      in which the penitent ex-pirates are shown us as hesitating in Venice for
      two years before they durst venture to England for fear of the gallows.
    
    
      "Captain Singleton" was published in 1720, a year after "Robinson Crusoe,"
      when Defoe was fifty-nine. Twenty years before had seen "The True-Born
      Englishman" and "The Shortest Way with the Dissenters"; and we are told
      that from "June 1687 to almost the very week of his death in 1731 a stream
      of controversial books and pamphlets poured from his pen commenting upon
      and marking every important passing event." The fecundity of Defoe as a
      journalist alone surpasses that of any great journalist we can name,
      William Cobbett not excepted, and we may add that the style of "Captain
      Singleton," like that of "Robinson Crusoe," is so perfect that there is
      not a single ineffective passage, or indeed a weak sentence, to be found
      in the book.

      THE LIFE, ADVENTURES, AND PIRACIES OF CAPTAIN SINGLETON
    
    
      As it is usual for great persons, whose lives have been remarkable, and
      whose actions deserve recording to posterity, to insist much upon their
      originals, give full accounts of their families, and the histories of
      their ancestors, so, that I may be methodical, I shall do the same, though
      I can look but a very little way into my pedigree, as you will see
      presently.
    
    
      If I may believe the woman whom I was taught to call mother, I was a
      little boy, of about two years old, very well dressed, had a nursery-maid
      to attend me, who took me out on a fine summer's evening into the fields
      towards Islington, as she pretended, to give the child some air; a little
      girl being with her, of twelve or fourteen years old, that lived in the
      neighbourhood. The maid, whether by appointment or otherwise, meets with a
      fellow, her sweetheart, as I suppose; he carries her into a public-house,
      to give her a pot and a cake; and while they were toying in the house the
      girl plays about, with me in her hand, in the garden and at the door,
      sometimes in sight, sometimes out of sight, thinking no harm.
    
    
      At this juncture comes by one of those sort of people who, it seems, made
      it their business to spirit away little children. This was a hellish trade
      in those days, and chiefly practised where they found little children very
      well dressed, or for bigger children, to sell them to the plantations.
    
    
      The woman, pretending to take me up in her arms and kiss me, and play with
      me, draws the girl a good way from the house, till at last she makes a
      fine story to the girl, and bids her go back to the maid, and tell her
      where she was with the child; that a gentlewoman had taken a fancy to the
      child, and was kissing of it, but she should not be frighted, or to that
      purpose; for they were but just there; and so, while the girl went, she
      carries me quite away.
    
    
      From this time, it seems, I was disposed of to a beggar woman that wanted
      a pretty little child to set out her case; and after that, to a gipsy,
      under whose government I continued till I was about six years old. And
      this woman, though I was continually dragged about with her from one part
      of the country to another, yet never let me want for anything; and I
      called her mother; though she told me at last she was not my mother, but
      that she bought me for twelve shillings of another woman, who told her how
      she came by me, and told her that my name was Bob Singleton, not Robert,
      but plain Bob; for it seems they never knew by what name I was christened.
    
    
      It is in vain to reflect here, what a terrible fright the careless hussy
      was in that lost me; what treatment she received from my justly enraged
      father and mother, and the horror these must be in at the thoughts of
      their child being thus carried away; for as I never knew anything of the
      matter, but just what I have related, nor who my father and mother were,
      so it would make but a needless digression to talk of it here.
    
    
      My good gipsy mother, for some of her worthy actions no doubt, happened in
      process of time to be hanged; and as this fell out something too soon for
      me to be perfected in the strolling trade, the parish where I was left,
      which for my life I can't remember, took some care of me, to be sure; for
      the first thing I can remember of myself afterwards, was, that I went to a
      parish school, and the minister of the parish used to talk to me to be a
      good boy; and that, though I was but a poor boy, if I minded my book, and
      served God, I might make a good man.
    
    
      I believe I was frequently removed from one town to another, perhaps as
      the parishes disputed my supposed mother's last settlement. Whether I was
      so shifted by passes, or otherwise, I know not; but the town where I last
      was kept, whatever its name was, must be not far off from the seaside; for
      a master of a ship who took a fancy to me, was the first that brought me
      to a place not far from Southampton, which I afterwards knew to be
      Bussleton; and there I attended the carpenters, and such people as were
      employed in building a ship for him; and when it was done, though I was
      not above twelve years old, he carried me to sea with him on a voyage to
      Newfoundland.
    
    
      I lived well enough, and pleased my master so well that he called me his
      own boy; and I would have called him father, but he would not allow it,
      for he had children of his own. I went three or four voyages with him, and
      grew a great sturdy boy, when, coming home again from the banks of
      Newfoundland, we were taken by an Algerine rover, or man-of-war; which, if
      my account stands right, was about the year 1695, for you may be sure I
      kept no journal.
    
    
      I was not much concerned at the disaster, though I saw my master, after
      having been wounded by a splinter in the head during the engagement, very
      barbarously used by the Turks; I say, I was not much concerned, till, upon
      some unlucky thing I said, which, as I remember, was about abusing my
      master, they took me and beat me most unmercifully with a flat stick on
      the soles of my feet, so that I could neither go or stand for several days
      together.
    
    
      But my good fortune was my friend upon this occasion; for, as they were
      sailing away with our ship in tow as a prize, steering for the Straits,
      and in sight of the bay of Cadiz, the Turkish rover was attacked by two
      great Portuguese men-of-war, and taken and carried into Lisbon.
    
    
      As I was not much concerned at my captivity, not indeed understanding the
      consequences of it, if it had continued, so I was not suitably sensible of
      my deliverance; nor, indeed, was it so much a deliverance to me as it
      would otherwise have been, for my master, who was the only friend I had in
      the world, died at Lisbon of his wounds; and I being then almost reduced
      to my primitive state, viz., of starving, had this addition to it, that it
      was in a foreign country too, where I knew nobody and could not speak a
      word of their language. However, I fared better here than I had reason to
      expect; for when all the rest of our men had their liberty to go where
      they would, I, that knew not whither to go, stayed in the ship for several
      days, till at length one of the lieutenants seeing me, inquired what that
      young English dog did there, and why they did not turn him on shore.
    
    
      I heard him, and partly understood what he meant, though not what he said,
      and began then to be in a terrible fright; for I knew not where to get a
      bit of bread; when the pilot of the ship, an old seaman, seeing me look
      very dull, came to me, and speaking broken English to me, told me I must
      be gone. "Whither must I go?" said I. "Where you will," said he, "home to
      your own country, if you will." "How must I go thither?" said I. "Why,
      have you no friend?" said he. "No," said I, "not in the world, but that
      dog," pointing to the ship's dog (who, having stolen a piece of meat just
      before, had brought it close by me, and I had taken it from him, and ate
      it), "for he has been a good friend, and brought me my dinner."
    
    
      "Well, well," says he, "you must have your dinner. Will you go with me?"
      "Yes," says I, "with all my heart." In short, the old pilot took me home
      with him, and used me tolerably well, though I fared hard enough; and I
      lived with him about two years, during which time he was soliciting his
      business, and at length got to be master or pilot under Don Garcia de
      Pimentesia de Carravallas, captain of a Portuguese galleon or carrack,
      which was bound to Goa, in the East Indies; and immediately having gotten
      his commission, put me on board to look after his cabin, in which he had
      stored himself with abundance of liquors, succades, sugar, spices, and
      other things, for his accommodation in the voyage, and laid in afterwards
      a considerable quantity of European goods, fine lace and linen; and also
      baize, woollen cloth, stuffs,      c., under the pretence of his clothes.
    
    
      I was too young in the trade to keep any journal of this voyage, though my
      master, who was, for a Portuguese, a pretty good artist, prompted me to
      it; but my not understanding the language was one hindrance; at least it
      served me for an excuse. However, after some time, I began to look into
      his charts and books; and, as I could write a tolerable hand, understood
      some Latin, and began to have a little smattering of the Portuguese
      tongue, so I began to get a superficial knowledge of navigation, but not
      such as was likely to be sufficient to carry me through a life of
      adventure, as mine was to be. In short, I learned several material things
      in this voyage among the Portuguese; I learned particularly to be an
      arrant thief and a bad sailor; and I think I may say they are the best
      masters for teaching both these of any nation in the world.
    
    
      We made our way for the East Indies, by the coast of Brazil; not that it
      is in the course of sailing the way thither, but our captain, either on
      his own account, or by the direction of the merchants, went thither first,
      where at All Saints' Bay, or, as they call it in Portugal, the Rio de
      Todos los Santos, we delivered near a hundred tons of goods, and took in a
      considerable quantity of gold, with some chests of sugar, and seventy or
      eighty great rolls of tobacco, every roll weighing at least a
      hundredweight.
    
    
      Here, being lodged on shore by my master's order, I had the charge of the
      captain's business, he having seen me very diligent for my own master; and
      in requital for his mistaken confidence, I found means to secure, that is
      to say, to steal, about twenty moidores out of the gold that was shipped
      on board by the merchants, and this was my first adventure.
    
    
      We had a tolerable voyage from hence to the Cape de Bona Speranza; and I
      was reputed as a mighty diligent servant to my master, and very faithful.
      I was diligent indeed, but I was very far from honest; however, they
      thought me honest, which, by the way, was their very great mistake. Upon
      this very mistake the captain took a particular liking to me, and employed
      me frequently on his own occasion; and, on the other hand, in recompense
      for my officious diligence, I received several particular favours from
      him; particularly, I was, by the captain's command, made a kind of a
      steward under the ship's steward, for such provisions as the captain
      demanded for his own table. He had another steward for his private stores
      besides, but my office concerned only what the captain called for of the
      ship's stores for his private use.
    
    
      However, by this means I had opportunity particularly to take care of my
      master's man, and to furnish myself with sufficient provisions to make me
      live much better than the other people in the ship; for the captain seldom
      ordered anything out of the ship's stores, as above, but I snipt some of
      it for my own share. We arrived at Goa, in the East Indies, in about seven
      months from Lisbon, and remained there eight more; during which time I had
      indeed nothing to do, my master being generally on shore, but to learn
      everything that is wicked among the Portuguese, a nation the most
      perfidious and the most debauched, the most insolent and cruel, of any
      that pretend to call themselves Christians, in the world.
    
    
      Thieving, lying, swearing, forswearing, joined to the most abominable
      lewdness, was the stated practice of the ship's crew; adding to it, that,
      with the most insufferable boasts of their own courage, they were,
      generally speaking, the most complete cowards that I ever met with; and
      the consequence of their cowardice was evident upon many occasions.
      However, there was here and there one among them that was not so bad as
      the rest; and, as my lot fell among them, it made me have the most
      contemptible thoughts of the rest, as indeed they deserved.
    
    
      I was exactly fitted for their society indeed; for I had no sense of
      virtue or religion upon me. I had never heard much of either, except what
      a good old parson had said to me when I was a child of about eight or nine
      years old; nay, I was preparing and growing up apace to be as wicked as
      anybody could be, or perhaps ever was. Fate certainly thus directed my
      beginning, knowing that I had work which I had to do in the world, which
      nothing but one hardened against all sense of honesty or religion could go
      through; and yet, even in this state of original wickedness, I entertained
      such a settled abhorrence of the abandoned vileness of the Portuguese,
      that I could not but hate them most heartily from the beginning, and all
      my life afterwards. They were so brutishly wicked, so base and perfidious,
      not only to strangers but to one another, so meanly submissive when
      subjected, so insolent, or barbarous and tyrannical, when superior, that I
      thought there was something in them that shocked my very nature. Add to
      this that it is natural to an Englishman to hate a coward, it all joined
      together to make the devil and a Portuguese equally my aversion.
    
    
      However, according to the English proverb, he that is shipped with the
      devil must sail with the devil; I was among them, and I managed myself as
      well as I could. My master had consented that I should assist the captain
      in the office, as above; but, as I understood afterwards that the captain
      allowed my master half a moidore a month for my service, and that he had
      my name upon the ship's books also, I expected that when the ship came to
      be paid four months' wages at the Indies, as they, it seems, always do, my
      master would let me have something for myself.
    
    
      But I was wrong in my man, for he was none of that kind; he had taken me
      up as in distress, and his business was to keep me so, and make his market
      of me as well as he could, which I began to think of after a different
      manner than I did at first, for at first I thought he had entertained me
      in mere charity, upon seeing my distressed circumstances, but did not
      doubt but when he put me on board the ship, I should have some wages for
      my service.
    
    
      But he thought, it seems, quite otherwise; and when I procured one to
      speak to him about it, when the ship was paid at Goa, he flew into the
      greatest rage imaginable, and called me English dog, young heretic, and
      threatened to put me into the Inquisition. Indeed, of all the names the
      four-and-twenty letters could make up, he should not have called me
      heretic; for as I knew nothing about religion, neither Protestant from
      Papist, or either of them from a Mahometan, I could never be a heretic.
      However, it passed but a little, but, as young as I was, I had been
      carried into the Inquisition, and there, if they had asked me if I was a
      Protestant or a Catholic, I should have said yes to that which came first.
      If it had been the Protestant they had asked first, it had certainly made
      a martyr of me for I did not know what.
    
    
      But the very priest they carried with them, or chaplain of the ship, as we
      called him, saved me; for seeing me a boy entirely ignorant of religion,
      and ready to do or say anything they bid me, he asked me some questions
      about it, which he found I answered so very simply, that he took it upon
      him to tell them he would answer for my being a good Catholic, and he
      hoped he should be the means of saving my soul, and he pleased himself
      that it was to be a work of merit to him; so he made me as good a Papist
      as any of them in about a week's time.
    
    
      I then told him my case about my master; how, it is true, he had taken me
      up in a miserable case on board a man-of-war at Lisbon; and I was indebted
      to him for bringing me on board this ship; that if I had been left at
      Lisbon, I might have starved, and the like; and therefore I was willing to
      serve him, but that I hoped he would give me some little consideration for
      my service, or let me know how long he expected I should serve him for
      nothing.
    
    
      It was all one; neither the priest nor any one else could prevail with
      him, but that I was not his servant but his slave, that he took me in the
      Algerine, and that I was a Turk, only pretended to be an English boy to
      get my liberty, and he would carry me to the Inquisition as a Turk.
    
    
      This frighted me out of my wits, for I had nobody to vouch for me what I
      was, or from whence I came; but the good Padre Antonio, for that was his
      name, cleared me of that part by a way I did not understand; for he came
      to me one morning with two sailors, and told me they must search me, to
      bear witness that I was not a Turk. I was amazed at them, and frighted,
      and did not understand them, nor could I imagine what they intended to do
      to me. However, stripping me, they were soon satisfied, and Father Antony
      bade me be easy, for they could all witness that I was no Turk. So I
      escaped that part of my master's cruelty.
    
    
      And now I resolved from that time to run away from him if I could, but
      there was no doing of it there, for there were not ships of any nation in
      the world in that port, except two or three Persian vessels from Ormus, so
      that if I had offered to go away from him, he would have had me seized on
      shore, and brought on board by force; so that I had no remedy but
      patience. And this he brought to an end too as soon as he could, for after
      this he began to use me ill, and not only to straiten my provisions, but
      to beat and torture me in a barbarous manner for every trifle, so that, in
      a word, my life began to be very miserable.
    
    
      The violence of this usage of me, and the impossibility of my escape from
      his hands, set my head a-working upon all sorts of mischief, and in
      particular I resolved, after studying all other ways to deliver myself,
      and finding all ineffectual, I say, I resolved to murder him. With this
      hellish resolution in my head, I spent whole nights and days contriving
      how to put it in execution, the devil prompting me very warmly to the
      fact. I was indeed entirely at a loss for the means, for I had neither gun
      or sword, nor any weapon to assault him with; poison I had my thoughts
      much upon, but knew not where to get any; or, if I might have got it, I
      did not know the country word for it, or by what name to ask for it.
    
    
      In this manner I quitted the fact, intentionally, a hundred and a hundred
      times; but Providence, either for his sake or for mine, always frustrated
      my designs, and I could never bring it to pass; so I was obliged to
      continue in his chains till the ship, having taken in her loading, set
      sail for Portugal.
    
    
      I can say nothing here to the manner of our voyage, for, as I said, I kept
      no journal; but this I can give an account of, that having been once as
      high as the Cape of Good Hope, as we call it, or Cabo de Bona Speranza, as
      they call it, we were driven back again by a violent storm from the
      W.S.W., which held us six days and nights a great way to the eastward, and
      after that, standing afore the wind for several days more, we at last came
      to an anchor on the coast of Madagascar.
    
    
      The storm had been so violent that the ship had received a great deal of
      damage, and it required some time to repair her; so, standing in nearer
      the shore, the pilot, my master, brought the ship into a very good
      harbour, where we rid in twenty-six fathoms water, about half a mile from
      the shore.
    
    
      While the ship rode here there happened a most desperate mutiny among the
      men, upon account of some deficiency in their allowance, which came to
      that height that they threatened the captain to set him on shore, and go
      back with the ship to Goa. I wished they would with all my heart, for I
      was full of mischief in my head, and ready enough to do any. So, though I
      was but a boy, as they called me, yet I prompted the mischief all I could,
      and embarked in it so openly, that I escaped very little being hanged in
      the first and most early part of my life; for the captain had some notice
      that there was a design laid by some of the company to murder him; and
      having, partly by money and promises, and partly by threatening and
      torture, brought two fellows to confess the particulars, and the names of
      the persons concerned, they were presently apprehended, till, one accusing
      another, no less than sixteen men were seized and put into irons, whereof
      I was one.
    
    
      The captain, who was made desperate by his danger, resolving to clear the
      ship of his enemies, tried us all, and we were all condemned to die. The
      manner of his process I was too young to take notice of; but the purser
      and one of the gunners were hanged immediately, and I expected it with the
      rest. I do not remember any great concern I was under about it, only that
      I cried very much, for I knew little then of this world, and nothing at
      all of the next.
    
    
      However, the captain contented himself with executing these two, and some
      of the rest, upon their humble submission and promise of future good
      behaviour, were pardoned; but five were ordered to be set on shore on the
      island and left there, of which I was one. My master used all his interest
      with the captain to have me excused, but could not obtain it; for somebody
      having told him that I was one of them who was singled out to have killed
      him, when my master desired I might not be set on shore, the captain told
      him I should stay on board if he desired it, but then I should be hanged,
      so he might choose for me which he thought best. The captain, it seems,
      was particularly provoked at my being concerned in the treachery, because
      of his having been so kind to me, and of his having singled me out to
      serve him, as I have said above; and this, perhaps, obliged him to give my
      master such a rough choice, either to set me on shore or to have me hanged
      on board. And had my master, indeed, known what good-will I had for him,
      he would not have been long in choosing for me; for I had certainly
      determined to do him a mischief the first opportunity I had for it. This
      was, therefore, a good providence for me to keep me from dipping my hands
      in blood, and it made me more tender afterwards in matters of blood than I
      believe I should otherwise have been. But as to my being one of them that
      was to kill the captain, that I was wronged in, for I was not the person,
      but it was really one of them that were pardoned, he having the good luck
      not to have that part discovered.
    
    
      I was now to enter upon a part of independent life, a thing I was indeed
      very ill prepared to manage, for I was perfectly loose and dissolute in my
      behaviour, bold and wicked while I was under government, and now perfectly
      unfit to be trusted with liberty, for I was as ripe for any villainy as a
      young fellow that had no solid thought ever placed in his mind could be
      supposed to be. Education, as you have heard, I had none; and all the
      little scenes of life I had passed through had been full of dangers and
      desperate circumstances; but I was either so young or so stupid, that I
      escaped the grief and anxiety of them, for want of having a sense of their
      tendency and consequences.
    
    
      This thoughtless, unconcerned temper had one felicity indeed in it, that
      it made me daring and ready for doing any mischief, and kept off the
      sorrow which otherwise ought to have attended me when I fell into any
      mischief; that this stupidity was instead of a happiness to me, for it
      left my thoughts free to act upon means of escape and deliverance in my
      distress, however great it might be; whereas my companions in the misery
      were so sunk by their fear and grief, that they abandoned themselves to
      the misery of their condition, and gave over all thought but of their
      perishing and starving, being devoured by wild beasts, murdered, and
      perhaps eaten by cannibals, and the like.
    
    
      I was but a young fellow, about seventeen or eighteen; but hearing what
      was to be my fate, I received it with no appearance of discouragement; but
      I asked what my master said to it, and being told that he had used his
      utmost interest to save me, but the captain had answered I should either
      go on shore or be hanged on board, which he pleased, I then gave over all
      hope of being received again. I was not very thankful in my thoughts to my
      master for his soliciting the captain for me, because I knew that what he
      did was not in kindness to me so much as in kindness to himself; I mean,
      to preserve the wages which he got for me, which amounted to above six
      dollars a month, including what the captain allowed him for my particular
      service to him.
    
    
      When I understood that my master was so apparently kind, I asked if I
      might not be admitted to speak with him, and they told me I might, if my
      master would come down to me, but I could not be allowed to come up to
      him; so then I desired my master might be spoke to to come to me, and he
      accordingly came to me. I fell on my knees to him, and begged he would
      forgive me what I had done to displease him; and indeed the resolution I
      had taken to murder him lay with some horror upon my mind just at that
      time, so that I was once just a-going to confess it, and beg him to
      forgive me, but I kept it in. He told me he had done all he could to
      obtain my pardon of the captain, but could not and he knew no way for me
      but to have patience, and submit to my fate; and if they came to speak
      with any ship of their nation at the Cape, he would endeavour to have them
      stand in, and fetch us off again, if we might be found.
    
    
      Then I begged I might have my clothes on shore with me. He told me he was
      afraid I should have little need of clothes, for he did not see how we
      could long subsist on the island, and that he had been told that the
      inhabitants were cannibals or men-eaters (though he had no reason for that
      suggestion), and we should not be able to live among them. I told him I
      was not so afraid of that as I was of starving for want of victuals; and
      as for the inhabitants being cannibals, I believed we should be more
      likely to eat them than they us, if we could but get at them. But I was
      mightily concerned, I said, we should have no weapons with us to defend
      ourselves, and I begged nothing now, but that he would give me a gun and a
      sword, with a little powder and shot.
    
    
      He smiled, and said they would signify nothing to us, for it was
      impossible for us to pretend to preserve our lives among such a populous
      and desperate nation as the people of this island were. I told him that,
      however, it would do us this good, for we should not be devoured or
      destroyed immediately; so I begged hard for the gun. At last he told me he
      did not know whether the captain would give him leave to give me a gun,
      and if not, he durst not do it; but he promised to use his interest to
      obtain it for me, which he did, and the next day he sent me a gun, with
      some ammunition, but told me the captain would not suffer the ammunition
      to be given us till we were set all on shore, and till he was just going
      to set sail. He also sent me the few clothes I had in the ship, which
      indeed were not many.
    
    
      Two days after this, we were all carried on shore together; the rest of my
      fellow-criminals hearing I had a gun, and some powder and shot, solicited
      for liberty to carry the like with them, which was also granted them; and
      thus we were set on shore to shift for ourselves.
    
    
      At our first coming into the island we were terrified exceedingly with the
      sight of the barbarous people, whose figure was made more terrible to us
      than it really was by the report we had of them from the seamen; but when
      we came to converse with them awhile, we found they were not cannibals, as
      was reported, or such as would fall immediately upon us and eat us up; but
      they came and sat down by us, and wondered much at our clothes and arms,
      and made signs to give us some victuals, such as they had, which was only
      roots and plants dug out of the ground for the present, but they brought
      us fowls and flesh afterwards in good plenty.
    
    
      This encouraged the other four men that were with me very much, for they
      were quite dejected before; but now they began to be very familiar with
      them, and made signs, that if they would use us kindly, we would stay and
      live with them; which they seemed glad of, though they knew little of the
      necessity we were under to do so, or how much we were afraid of them.
    
    
      However, upon second thoughts we resolved that we would only stay in that
      part so long as the ship rid in the bay, and then making them believe we
      were gone with the ship, we would go and place ourselves, if possible,
      where there were no inhabitants to be seen, and so live as we could, or
      perhaps watch for a ship that might be driven upon the coast as we were.
    
    
      The ship continued a fortnight in the roads, repairing some damage which
      had been done her in the late storm, and taking in wood and water; and
      during this time, the boat coming often on shore, the men brought us
      several refreshments, and the natives believing we only belonged to the
      ship, were civil enough. We lived in a kind of a tent on the shore, or
      rather a hut, which we made with the boughs of trees, and sometimes in the
      night retired to a wood a little out of their way, to let them think we
      were gone on board the ship. However, we found them barbarous,
      treacherous, and villainous enough in their nature, only civil from fear,
      and therefore concluded we should soon fall into their hands when the ship
      was gone.
    
    
      The sense of this wrought upon my fellow-sufferers even to distraction;
      and one of them, being a carpenter, in his mad fit, swam off to the ship
      in the night, though she lay then a league to sea, and made such pitiful
      moan to be taken in, that the captain was prevailed with at last to take
      him in, though they let him lie swimming three hours in the water before
      he consented to it.
    
    
      Upon this, and his humble submission, the captain received him, and, in a
      word, the importunity of this man (who for some time petitioned to be
      taken in, though they hanged him as soon as they had him) was such as
      could not be resisted; for, after he had swam so long about the ship, he
      was not able to reach the shore again; and the captain saw evidently that
      the man must be taken on board or suffered to drown, and the whole ship's
      company offering to be bound for him for his good behaviour, the captain
      at last yielded, and he was taken up, but almost dead with his being so
      long in the water.
    
    
      When this man was got in, he never left importuning the captain, and all
      the rest of the officers, in behalf of us that were behind, but to the
      very last day the captain was inexorable; when, at the time their
      preparations were making to sail, and orders given to hoist the boats into
      the ship, all the seamen in a body came up to the rail of the
      quarter-deck, where the captain was walking with some of his officers, and
      appointing the boatswain to speak for them, he went up, and falling on his
      knees to the captain, begged of him, in the humblest manner possible, to
      receive the four men on board again, offering to answer for their
      fidelity, or to have them kept in chains till they came to Lisbon, and
      there to be delivered up to justice, rather than, as they said, to have
      them left to be murdered by savages, or devoured by wild beasts. It was a
      great while ere the captain took any notice of them, but when he did, he
      ordered the boatswain to be seized, and threatened to bring him to the
      capstan for speaking for them.
    
    
      Upon this severity, one of the seamen, bolder than the rest, but still
      with all possible respect to the captain, besought his honour, as he
      called him, that he would give leave to some more of them to go on shore,
      and die with their companions, or, if possible, to assist them to resist
      the barbarians. The captain, rather provoked than cowed with this, came to
      the barricade of the quarter-deck, and speaking very prudently to the men
      (for had he spoken roughly, two-thirds of them would have left the ship,
      if not all of them), he told them, it was for their safety as well as his
      own that he had been obliged to that severity; that mutiny on board a ship
      was the same thing as treason in a king's palace, and he could not answer
      it to his owners and employers to trust the ship and goods committed to
      his charge with men who had entertained thoughts of the worst and blackest
      nature; that he wished heartily that it had been anywhere else that they
      had been set on shore, where they might have been in less hazard from the
      savages; that, if he had designed they should be destroyed, he could as
      well have executed them on board as the other two; that he wished it had
      been in some other part of the world, where he might have delivered them
      up to the civil justice, or might have left them among Christians; but it
      was better their lives were put in hazard than his life, and the safety of
      the ship; and that though he did not know that he had deserved so ill of
      any of them as that they should leave the ship rather than do their duty,
      yet if any of them were resolved to do so unless he would consent to take
      a gang of traitors on board, who, as he had proved before them all, had
      conspired to murder him, he would not hinder them, nor for the present
      would he resent their importunity; but, if there was nobody left in the
      ship but himself, he would never consent to take them on board.
    
    
      This discourse was delivered so well, was in itself so reasonable, was
      managed with so much temper, yet so boldly concluded with a negative, that
      the greatest part of the men were satisfied for the present. However, as
      it put the men into juntos and cabals, they were not composed for some
      hours; the wind also slackening towards night, the captain ordered not to
      weigh till next morning.
    
    
      The same night twenty-three of the men, among whom was the gunner's mate,
      the surgeon's assistant, and two carpenters, applying to the chief mate
      told him, that as the captain had given them leave to go on shore to their
      comrades, they begged that he would speak to the captain not to take it
      ill that they were desirous to go and die with their companions; and that
      they thought they could do no less in such an extremity than go to them;
      because, if there was any way to save their lives, it was by adding to
      their numbers, and making them strong enough to assist one another in
      defending themselves against the savages, till perhaps they might one time
      or other find means to make their escape, and get to their own country
      again.
    
    
      The mate told them, in so many words, that he durst not speak to the
      captain upon any such design, and was very sorry they had no more respect
      for him than to desire him to go upon such an errand; but, if they were
      resolved upon such an enterprise, he would advise them to take the
      long-boat in the morning betimes, and go off, seeing the captain had given
      them leave, and leave a civil letter behind them to the captain, and to
      desire him to send his men on shore for the boat, which should be
      delivered very honestly, and he promised to keep their counsel so long.
    
    
      Accordingly, an hour before day, those twenty-three men, with every man a
      firelock and a cutlass, with some pistols, three halberds or half-pikes,
      and good store of powder and ball, without any provision but about half a
      hundred of bread, but with all their chests and clothes, tools,
      instruments, books,      c., embarked themselves so silently, that the
      captain got no notice of it till they were gotten half the way on shore.
    
    
      As soon as the captain heard of it he called for the gunner's mate, the
      chief gunner being at the time sick in his cabin, and ordered to fire at
      them; but, to his great mortification, the gunner's mate was one of the
      number, and was gone with them; and indeed it was by this means they got
      so many arms and so much ammunition. When the captain found how it was,
      and that there was no help for it, he began to be a little appeased, and
      made light of it, and called up the men, and spoke kindly to them, and
      told them he was very well satisfied in the fidelity and ability of those
      that were now left, and that he would give to them, for their
      encouragement, to be divided among them, the wages which were due to the
      men that were gone, and that it was a great satisfaction to him that the
      ship was free from such a mutinous rabble, who had not the least reason
      for their discontent.
    
    
      The men seemed very well satisfied, and particularly the promise of the
      wages of those who were gone went a great way with them. After this, the
      letter which was left by the men was given to the captain by his boy, with
      whom, it seems, the men had left it. The letter was much to the same
      purpose of what they had said to the mate, and which he declined to say
      for them, only that at the end of their letter they told the captain that,
      as they had no dishonest design, so they had taken nothing away with them
      which was not their own, except some arms and ammunition, such as were
      absolutely necessary to them, as well for their defence against the
      savages as to kill fowls or beasts for their food, that they might not
      perish; and as there were considerable sums due to them for wages, they
      hoped he would allow the arms and ammunition upon their accounts. They
      told him that, as to the ship's longboat, which they had taken to bring
      them on shore, they knew it was necessary to him, and they were very
      willing to restore it to him, and if he pleased to send for it, it should
      be very honestly delivered to his men, and not the least injury offered to
      any of those who came for it, nor the least persuasion or invitation made
      use of to any of them to stay with them; and, at the bottom of the letter,
      they very humbly besought him that, for their defence, and for the safety
      of their lives, he would be pleased to send them a barrel of powder and
      some ammunition, and give them leave to keep the mast and sail of the
      boat, that if it was possible for them to make themselves a boat of any
      kind, they might shift off to sea, to save themselves in such part of the
      world as their fate should direct them to.
    
    
      Upon this the captain, who had won much upon the rest of his men by what
      he had said to them, and was very easy as to the general peace (for it was
      very true that the most mutinous of the men were gone), came out to the
      quarter-deck, and, calling the men together, let them know the substance
      of the letter, and told the men that, however they had not deserved such
      civility from him, yet he was not willing to expose them more than they
      were willing to expose themselves; he was inclined to send them some
      ammunition, and as they had desired but one barrel of powder, he would
      send them two barrels, and shot, or lead and moulds to make shot, in
      proportion; and, to let them see that he was civiller to them than they
      deserved, he ordered a cask of arrack and a great bag of bread to be sent
      them for subsistence till they should be able to furnish themselves.
    
    
      The rest of the men applauded the captain's generosity, and every one of
      them sent us something or other, and about three in the afternoon the
      pinnace came on shore, and brought us all these things, which we were very
      glad of, and returned the long-boat accordingly; and as to the men that
      came with the pinnace, as the captain had singled out such men as he knew
      would not come over to us, so they had positive orders not to bring any
      one of us on board again, upon pain of death; and indeed both were so true
      to our points, that we neither asked them to stay, nor they us to go.
    
    
      We were now a good troop, being in all twenty-seven men, very well armed,
      and provided with everything but victuals; we had two carpenters among us,
      a gunner, and, which was worth all the rest, a surgeon or doctor; that is
      to say, he was an assistant to a surgeon at Goa, and was entertained as a
      supernumerary with us. The carpenters had brought all their tools, the
      doctor all his instruments and medicines, and indeed we had a great deal
      of baggage, that is to say, on the whole, for some of us had little more
      than the clothes on our backs, of whom I was one; but I had one thing
      which none of them had, viz., I had the twenty-two moidores of gold which
      I had stole at the Brazils, and two pieces of eight. The two pieces of
      eight I showed, and one moidore, and none of them ever suspected that I
      had any more money in the world, having been known to be only a poor boy
      taken up in charity, as you have heard, and used like a slave, and in the
      worst manner of a slave, by my cruel master the pilot.
    
    
      It will be easy to imagine we four that were left at first were joyful,
      nay, even surprised with joy at the coming of the rest, though at first we
      were frighted, and thought they came to fetch us back to hang us; but they
      took ways quickly to satisfy us that they were in the same condition with
      us, only with this additional circumstance, theirs was voluntary, and ours
      by force.
    
    
      The first piece of news they told us after the short history of their
      coming away was, that our companion was on board, but how he got thither
      we could not imagine, for he had given us the slip, and we never imagined
      he could swim so well as to venture off to the ship, which lay at so great
      a distance; nay, we did not so much as know that he could swim at all, and
      not thinking anything of what really happened, we thought he must have
      wandered into the woods and was devoured, or was fallen into the hands of
      the natives, and was murdered; and these thoughts filled us with fears
      enough, and of several kinds, about its being some time or other our lot
      to fall into their hands also. But hearing how he had with much difficulty
      been received on board the ship again and pardoned, we were much better
      satisfied than before.
    
    
      Being now, as I have said, a considerable number of us, and in condition
      to defend ourselves, the first thing we did was to give every one his hand
      that we would not separate from one another upon any occasion whatsoever,
      but that we would live and die together; that we would kill no food, but
      that we would distribute it in public; and that we would be in all things
      guided by the majority, and not insist upon our own resolutions in
      anything if the majority were against it; that we would appoint a captain
      among us to be our governor or leader during pleasure; that while he was
      in office we would obey him without reserve, on pain of death; and that
      every one should take turn, but the captain was not to act in any
      particular thing without advice of the rest, and by the majority.
    
    
      Having established these rules, we resolved to enter into some measures
      for our food, and for conversing with the inhabitants or natives of the
      island for our supply. As for food, they were at first very useful to us,
      but we soon grew weary of them, being an ignorant, ravenous, brutish sort
      of people, even worse than the natives of any other country that we had
      seen; and we soon found that the principal part of our subsistence was to
      be had by our guns, shooting of deer and other creatures, and fowls of all
      other sorts, of which there is abundance.
    
    
      We found the natives did not disturb or concern themselves much about us;
      nor did they inquire, or perhaps know, whether we stayed among them or
      not, much less that our ship was gone quite away, and had cast us off, as
      was our case; for the next morning, after we had sent back the long-boat,
      the ship stood away to the south-east, and in four hours' time was out of
      our sight.
    
    
      The next day two of us went out into the country one way, and two another,
      to see what kind of a land we were in; and we soon found the country was
      very pleasant and fruitful, and a convenient place enough to live in; but,
      as before, inhabited by a parcel of creatures scarce human, or capable of
      being made social on any account whatsoever.
    
    
      We found the place full of cattle and provisions; but whether we might
      venture to take them where we could find them or not, we did not know; and
      though we were under a necessity to get provisions, yet we were loth to
      bring down a whole nation of devils upon us at once, and therefore some of
      our company agreed to try to speak with some of the country, if we could,
      that we might see what course was to be taken with them. Eleven of our men
      went on this errand, well armed and furnished for defence. They brought
      word that they had seen some of the natives, who appeared very civil to
      them, but very shy and afraid, seeing their guns, for it was easy to
      perceive that the natives knew what their guns were, and what use they
      were of.
    
    
      They made signs to the natives for some food, and they went and fetched
      several herbs and roots, and some milk; but it was evident they did not
      design to give it away, but to sell it, making signs to know what our men
      would give them.
    
    
      Our men were perplexed at this, for they had nothing to barter; however,
      one of the men pulled out a knife and showed them, and they were so fond
      of it that they were ready to go together by the ears for the knife. The
      seaman seeing that, was willing to make a good market of his knife, and
      keeping them chaffering about it a good while, some offered him roots, and
      others milk; at last one offered him a goat for it, which he took. Then
      another of our men showed them another knife, but they had nothing good
      enough for that, whereupon one of them made signs that he would go and
      fetch something; so our men stayed three hours for their return, when they
      came back and brought him a small-sized, thick, short cow, very fat and
      good meat, and gave him for his knife.
    
    
      This was a good market, but our misfortune was we had no merchandise; for
      our knives were as needful to us as to them, and but that we were in
      distress for food, and must of necessity have some, these men would not
      have parted with their knives.
    
    
      However, in a little time more we found that the woods were full of living
      creatures, which we might kill for our food, and that without giving
      offence to them; so that our men went daily out a-hunting, and never
      failed in killing something or other; for, as to the natives, we had no
      goods to barter; and for money, all the stock among us would not have
      subsisted us long. However, we called a general council to see what money
      we had, and to bring it all together, that it might go as far as possible;
      and when it came to my turn, I pulled out a moidore and the two dollars I
      spoke of before.
    
    
      This moidore I ventured to show, that they might not despise me too much
      for adding too little to the store, and that they might not pretend to
      search me; and they were very civil to me, upon the presumption that I had
      been so faithful to them as not to conceal anything from them.
    
    
      But our money did us little service, for the people neither knew the value
      or the use of it, nor could they justly rate the gold in proportion with
      the silver; so that all our money, which was not much when it was all put
      together, would go but a little way with us, that is to say, to buy us
      provisions.
    
    
      Our next consideration was to get away from this cursed place, and whither
      to go. When my opinion came to be asked, I told them I would leave that
      all to them, and I told them I had rather they would let me go into the
      woods to get them some provisions, than consult with me, for I would agree
      to whatever they did; but they would not agree to that, for they would not
      consent that any of us should go into the woods alone; for though we had
      yet seen no lions or tigers in the woods, we were assured there were many
      in the island, besides other creatures as dangerous, and perhaps worse, as
      we afterwards found by our own experience.
    
    
      We had many adventures in the woods, for our provisions, and often met
      with wild and terrible beasts, which we could not call by their names; but
      as they were, like us, seeking their prey, but were themselves good for
      nothing, so we disturbed them as little as possible.
    
    
      Our consultations concerning our escape from this place, which, as I have
      said, we were now upon, ended in this only, that as we had two carpenters
      among us, and that they had tools almost of all sorts with them, we should
      try to build us a boat to go off to sea with, and that then, perhaps, we
      might find our way back to Goa, or land on some more proper place to make
      our escape. The counsels of this assembly were not of great moment, yet as
      they seem to be introductory of many more remarkable adventures which
      happened under my conduct hereabouts many years after, I think this
      miniature of my future enterprises may not be unpleasant to relate.
    
    
      To the building of a boat I made no objection, and away they went to work
      immediately; but as they went on, great difficulties occurred, such as the
      want of saws to cut our plank; nails, bolts, and spikes, to fasten the
      timbers; hemp, pitch, and tar, to caulk and pay her seams, and the like.
      At length, one of the company proposed that, instead of building a bark or
      sloop, or shallop, or whatever they would call it, which they found was so
      difficult, they would rather make a large periagua, or canoe, which might
      be done with great ease.
    
    
      It was presently objected, that we could never make a canoe large enough
      to pass the great ocean, which we were to go over to get to the coast of
      Malabar; that it not only would not bear the sea, but it would never bear
      the burden, for we were not only twenty-seven men of us, but had a great
      deal of luggage with us, and must, for our provision, take in a great deal
      more.
    
    
      I never proposed to speak in their general consultations before, but
      finding they were at some loss about what kind of vessel they should make,
      and how to make it, and what would be fit for our use, and what not, I
      told them I found they were at a full stop in their counsels of every
      kind; that it was true we could never pretend to go over to Goa on the
      coast of Malabar in a canoe, which though we could all get into it, and
      that it would bear the sea well enough, yet would not hold our provisions,
      and especially we could not put fresh water enough into it for the voyage;
      and to make such an adventure would be nothing but mere running into
      certain destruction, and yet that nevertheless I was for making a canoe.
    
    
      They answered, that they understood all I had said before well enough, but
      what I meant by telling them first how dangerous and impossible it was to
      make our escape in a canoe, and yet then to advise making a canoe, that
      they could not understand.
    
    
      To this I answered, that I conceived our business was not to attempt our
      escape in a canoe, but that, as there were other vessels at sea besides
      our ship, and that there were few nations that lived on the sea-shore that
      were so barbarous, but that they went to sea in some boats or other, our
      business was to cruise along the coast of the island, which was very long,
      and to seize upon the first we could get that was better than our own, and
      so from that to another, till perhaps we might at last get a good ship to
      carry us wherever we pleased to go.
    
    
      "Excellent advice," says one of them. "Admirable advice," says another.
      "Yes, yes," says the third (which was the gunner), "the English dog has
      given excellent advice; but it is just the way to bring us all to the
      gallows. The rogue has given us devilish advice, indeed, to go a-thieving,
      till from a little vessel we came to a great ship, and so we shall turn
      downright pirates, the end of which is to be hanged."
    
    
      "You may call us pirates," says another, "if you will, and if we fall into
      bad hands, we may be used like pirates; but I care not for that, I'll be a
      pirate, or anything, nay, I'll be hanged for a pirate rather than starve
      here, therefore I think the advice is very good." And so they cried all,
      "Let us have a canoe." The gunner, over-ruled by the rest, submitted; but
      as we broke up the council, he came to me, takes me by the hand, and,
      looking into the palm of my hand, and into my face too, very gravely, "My
      lad," says he, "thou art born to do a world of mischief; thou hast
      commenced pirate very young; but have a care of the gallows, young man;
      have a care, I say, for thou wilt be an eminent thief."
    
    
      I laughed at him, and told him I did not know what I might come to
      hereafter, but as our case was now, I should make no scruple to take the
      first ship I came at to get our liberty; I only wished we could see one,
      and come at her. Just while we were talking, one of our men that was at
      the door of our hut, told us that the carpenter, who it seems was upon a
      hill at a distance, cried out, "A sail! a sail!"
    
    
      We all turned out immediately; but, though it was very clear weather, we
      could see nothing; but the carpenter continuing to halloo to us, "A sail!
      a sail!" away we run up the hill, and there we saw a ship plainly; but it
      was at a very great distance, too far for us to make any signal to her.
      However, we made a fire upon the hill, with all the wood we could get
      together, and made as much smoke as possible. The wind was down, and it
      was almost calm; but as we thought, by a perspective glass which the
      gunner had in his pocket, her sails were full, and she stood away large
      with the wind at E.N.E., taking no notice of our signal, but making for
      the Cape de Bona Speranza; so we had no comfort from her.
    
    
      We went, therefore, immediately to work about our intended canoe; and,
      having singled out a very large tree to our minds, we fell to work with
      her; and having three good axes among us, we got it down, but it was four
      days' time first, though we worked very hard too. I do not remember what
      wood it was, or exactly what dimensions, but I remember that it was a very
      large one, and we were as much encouraged when we launched it, and found
      it swam upright and steady, as we would have been at another time if we
      had had a good man-of-war at our command.
    
    
      She was so very large, that she carried us all very, very easily, and
      would have carried two or three tons of baggage with us; so that we began
      to consult about going to sea directly to Goa; but many other
      considerations checked that thought, especially when we came to look
      nearer into it; such as want of provisions, and no casks for fresh water;
      no compass to steer by; no shelter from the breach of the high sea, which
      would certainly founder us; no defence from the heat of the weather, and
      the like; so that they all came readily into my project, to cruise about
      where we were, and see what might offer.
    
    
      Accordingly, to gratify our fancy, we went one day all out to sea in her
      together, and we were in a very fair way to have had enough of it; for
      when she had us all on board, and that we were gotten about half a league
      to sea, there happening to be a pretty high swell of the sea, though
      little or no wind, yet she wallowed so in the sea, that we all of us
      thought she would at last wallow herself bottom up; so we set all to work
      to get her in nearer the shore, and giving her fresh way in the sea, she
      swam more steady, and with some hard work we got her under the land again.
    
    
      We were now at a great loss; the natives were civil enough to us, and came
      often to discourse with us; one time they brought one whom they showed
      respect to as a king with them, and they set up a long pole between them
      and us, with a great tassel of hair hanging, not on the top, but something
      above the middle of it, adorned with little chains, shells, bits of brass,
      and the like; and this, we understood afterwards, was a token of amity and
      friendship; and they brought down to us victuals in abundance, cattle,
      fowls, herbs, and roots; but we were in the utmost confusion on our side;
      for we had nothing to buy with, or exchange for; and as to giving us
      things for nothing they had no notion of that again. As to our money, it
      was mere trash to them, they had no value for it; so that we were in a
      fair way to be starved. Had we had but some toys and trinkets, brass
      chains, baubles, glass beads, or, in a word, the veriest trifles that a
      shipload of would not have been worth the freight, we might have bought
      cattle and provisions enough for an army, or to victual a fleet of
      men-of-war; but for gold or silver we could get nothing.
    
    
      Upon this we were in a strange consternation. I was but a young fellow,
      but I was for falling upon them with our firearms, and taking all the
      cattle from them, and send them to the devil to stop their hunger, rather
      than be starved ourselves; but I did not consider that this might have
      brought ten thousand of them down upon us the next day; and though we
      might have killed a vast number of them, and perhaps have frighted the
      rest, yet their own desperation, and our small number, would have animated
      them so that, one time or other, they would have destroyed us all.
    
    
      In the middle of our consultation, one of our men who had been a kind of a
      cutler, or worker in iron, started up and asked the carpenter if, among
      all his tools, he could not help him to a file. "Yes," says the carpenter,
      "I can, but it is a small one." "The smaller the better," says the other.
      Upon this he goes to work, and first by heating a piece of an old broken
      chisel in the fire, and then with the help of his file, he made himself
      several kinds of tools for his work. Then he takes three or four pieces of
      eight, and beats them out with a hammer upon a stone, till they were very
      broad and thin; then he cuts them out into the shape of birds and beasts;
      he made little chains of them for bracelets and necklaces, and turned them
      into so many devices of his own head, that it is hardly to be expressed.
    
    
      When he had for about a fortnight exercised his head and hands at this
      work, we tried the effect of his ingenuity; and, having another meeting
      with the natives, were surprised to see the folly of the poor people. For
      a little bit of silver cut in the shape of a bird, we had two cows, and,
      which was our loss, if it had been in brass, it had been still of more
      value. For one of the bracelets made of chain-work, we had as much
      provision of several sorts, as would fairly have been worth, in England,
      fifteen or sixteen pounds; and so of all the rest. Thus, that which when
      it was in coin was not worth sixpence to us, when thus converted into toys
      and trifles, was worth a hundred times its real value, and purchased for
      us anything we had occasion for.
    
    
      In this condition we lived upwards of a year, but all of us began to be
      very much tired of it, and, whatever came of it, resolved to attempt an
      escape. We had furnished ourselves with no less than three very good
      canoes; and as the monsoons, or trade-winds, generally affect that
      country, blowing in most parts of this island one six months of a year one
      way, and the other six months another way, we concluded we might be able
      to bear the sea well enough. But always, when we came to look into it, the
      want of fresh water was the thing that put us off from such an adventure,
      for it is a prodigious length, and what no man on earth could be able to
      perform without water to drink.
    
    
      Being thus prevailed upon by our own reason to set the thoughts of that
      voyage aside, we had then but two things before us; one was, to put to sea
      the other way; viz., west, and go away for the Cape of Good Hope, where,
      first or last, we should meet with some of our own country ships, or else
      to put for the mainland of Africa, and either travel by land, or sail
      along the coast towards the Red Sea, where we should, first or last, find
      a ship of some nation or other, that would take us up; or perhaps we might
      take them up, which, by-the-bye, was the thing that always ran in my head.
    
    
      It was our ingenious cutler, whom ever after we called silversmith, that
      proposed this; but the gunner told him, that he had been in the Red Sea in
      a Malabar sloop, and he knew this, that if we went into the Red Sea, we
      should either be killed by the wild Arabs, or taken and made slaves of by
      the Turks; and therefore he was not for going that way.
    
    
      Upon this I took occasion to put in my vote again. "Why," said I, "do we
      talk of being killed by the Arabs, or made slaves of by the Turks? Are we
      not able to board almost any vessel we shall meet with in those seas; and,
      instead of their taking us, we to take them?" "Well done, pirate," said
      the gunner (he that had looked in my hand, and told me I should come to
      the gallows), "I'll say that for him," says he, "he always looks the same
      way. But I think, of my conscience, it is our only way now." "Don't tell
      me," says I, "of being a pirate; we must be pirates, or anything, to get
      fairly out of this cursed place."
    
    
      In a word, they concluded all, by my advice, that our business was to
      cruise for anything we could see. "Why then," said I to them, "our first
      business is to see if the people upon this island have no navigation, and
      what boats they use; and, if they have any better or bigger than ours, let
      us take one of them." First, indeed, all our aim was to get, if possible,
      a boat with a deck and a sail; for then we might have saved our
      provisions, which otherwise we could not.
    
    
      We had, to our great good fortune, one sailor among us, who had been
      assistant to the cook; he told us, that he would find a way how to
      preserve our beef without cask or pickle; and this he did effectually by
      curing it in the sun, with the help of saltpetre, of which there was great
      plenty in the island; so that, before we found any method for our escape,
      we had dried the flesh of six or seven cows and bullocks, and ten or
      twelve goats, and it relished so well, that we never gave ourselves the
      trouble to boil it when we ate it, but either broiled it or ate it dry.
      But our main difficulty about fresh water still remained; for we had no
      vessel to put any into, much less to keep any for our going to sea.
    
    
      But our first voyage being only to coast the island, we resolved to
      venture, whatever the hazard or consequence of it might be, and in order
      to preserve as much fresh water as we could, our carpenter made a well
      athwart the middle of one of our canoes, which he separated from the other
      parts of the canoe, so as to make it tight to hold the water and covered
      so as we might step upon it; and this was so large that it held near a
      hogshead of water very well. I cannot better describe this well than by
      the same kind which the small fishing-boats in England have to preserve
      their fish alive in; only that this, instead of having holes to let the
      salt water in, was made sound every way to keep it out; and it was the
      first invention, I believe, of its kind for such an use; but necessity is
      a spur to ingenuity and the mother of invention.
    
    
      It wanted but a little consultation to resolve now upon our voyage. The
      first design was only to coast it round the island, as well to see if we
      could seize upon any vessel fit to embark ourselves in, as also to take
      hold of any opportunity which might present for our passing over to the
      main; and therefore our resolution was to go on the inside or west shore
      of the island, where, at least at one point, the land stretching a great
      way to the north-west, the distance is not extraordinary great from the
      island to the coast of Africa.
    
    
      Such a voyage, and with such a desperate crew, I believe was never made,
      for it is certain we took the worst side of the island to look for any
      shipping, especially for shipping of other nations, this being quite out
      of the way; however, we put to sea, after taking all our provisions and
      ammunition, bag and baggage, on board; we had made both mast and sail for
      our two large periaguas, and the other we paddled along as well as we
      could; but when a gale sprung up, we took her in tow.
    
    
      We sailed merrily forward for several days, meeting with nothing to
      interrupt us. We saw several of the natives in small canoes catching fish,
      and sometimes we endeavoured to come near enough to speak with them, but
      they were always shy and afraid of us, making in for the shore as soon as
      we attempted it; till one of our company remembered the signal of
      friendship which the natives made us from the south part of the island,
      viz., of setting up a long pole, and put us in mind that perhaps it was
      the same thing to them as a flag of truce to us. So we resolved to try it;
      and accordingly the next time we saw any of their fishing-boats at sea we
      put up a pole in our canoe that had no sail, and rowed towards them. As
      soon as they saw the pole they stayed for us, and as we came nearer
      paddled towards us; when they came to us they showed themselves very much
      pleased, and gave us some large fish, of which we did not know the names,
      but they were very good. It was our misfortune still that we had nothing
      to give them in return; but our artist, of whom I spoke before, gave them
      two little thin plates of silver, beaten, as I said before, out of a piece
      of eight; they were cut in a diamond square, longer one way than the
      other, and a hole punched at one of the longest corners. This they were so
      fond of that they made us stay till they had cast their lines and nets
      again, and gave us as many fish as we cared to have.
    
    
      All this while we had our eyes upon their boats, viewed them very
      narrowly, and examined whether any of them were fit for our turn, but they
      were poor, sorry things; their sail was made of a large mat, only one that
      was of a piece of cotton stuff fit for little, and their ropes were
      twisted flags of no strength; so we concluded we were better as we were,
      and let them alone. We went forward to the north, keeping the coast close
      on board for twelve days together, and having the wind at east and E.S.E.,
      we made very fresh way. We saw no towns on the shore, but often saw some
      huts by the water-side upon the rocks, and always abundance of people
      about them, who we could perceive run together to stare at us.
    
    
      It was as odd a voyage as ever man went; we were a little fleet of three
      ships, and an army of between twenty and thirty as dangerous fellows as
      ever they had amongst them; and had they known what we were, they would
      have compounded to give us everything we desired to be rid of us.
    
    
      On the other hand, we were as miserable as nature could well make us to
      be, for we were upon a voyage and no voyage, we were bound somewhere and
      nowhere; for though we knew what we intended to do, we did really not know
      what we were doing. We went forward and forward by a northerly course, and
      as we advanced the heat increased, which began to be intolerable to us,
      who were on the water, without any covering from heat or wet; besides, we
      were now in the month of October, or thereabouts, in a southern latitude;
      and as we went every day nearer the sun, the sun came also every day
      nearer to us, till at last we found ourselves in the latitude of 20
      degrees; and having passed the tropic about five or six days before that,
      in a few days more the sun would be in the zenith, just over our heads.
    
    
      Upon these considerations we resolved to seek for a good place to go on
      shore again, and pitch our tents, till the heat of the weather abated. We
      had by this time measured half the length of the island, and were come to
      that part where the shore tending away to the north-west, promised fair to
      make our passage over to the mainland of Africa much shorter than we
      expected. But, notwithstanding that, we had good reason to believe it was
      about 120 leagues.
    
    
      So, the heats considered, we resolved to take harbour; besides, our
      provisions were exhausted, and we had not many days' store left.
      Accordingly, putting in for the shore early in the morning, as we usually
      did once in three or four days for fresh water, we sat down and considered
      whether we would go on or take up our standing there; but upon several
      considerations, too long to repeat here, we did not like the place, so we
      resolved to go on a few days longer.
    
    
      After sailing on N.W. by N. with a fresh gale at S.E., about six days, we
      found, at a great distance, a large promontory or cape of land, pushing
      out a long way into the sea, and as we were exceeding fond of seeing what
      was beyond the cape, we resolved to double it before we took into harbour,
      so we kept on our way, the gale continuing, and yet it was four days more
      before we reached the cape. But it is not possible to express the
      discouragement and melancholy that seized us all when we came thither; for
      when we made the headland of the cape, we were surprised to see the shore
      fall away on the other side as much as it had advanced on this side, and a
      great deal more; and that, in short, if we would venture over to the shore
      of Africa, it must be from hence, for that if we went further, the breadth
      of the sea still increased, and to what breadth it might increase we knew
      not.
    
    
      While we mused upon this discovery, we were surprised with very bad
      weather, and especially violent rains, with thunder and lightning, most
      unusually terrible to us. In this pickle we run for the shore, and getting
      under the lee of the cape, run our frigates into a little creek, where we
      saw the land overgrown with trees, and made all the haste possible to get
      on shore, being exceeding wet, and fatigued with the heat, the thunder,
      lightning, and rain.
    
    
      Here we thought our case was very deplorable indeed, and therefore our
      artist, of whom I have spoken so often, set up a great cross of wood on
      the hill which was within a mile of the headland, with these words, but in
      the Portuguese language:       
    
    
      "Point Desperation. Jesus have mercy."
    
    
      We set to work immediately to build us some huts, and to get our clothes
      dried; and though I was young and had no skill in such things, yet I shall
      never forget the little city we built, for it was no less, and we
      fortified it accordingly; and the idea is so fresh in my thought, that I
      cannot but give a short description of it.
    
    
      Our camp was on the south side of a little creek on the sea, and under the
      shelter of a steep hill, which lay, though on the other side of the creek,
      yet within a quarter of a mile of us, N.W. by N., and very happily
      intercepted the heat of the sun all the after part of the day. The spot we
      pitched on had a little fresh water brook, or a stream running into the
      creek by us; and we saw cattle feeding in the plains and low ground east
      and to the south of us a great way.
    
    
      Here we set up twelve little huts like soldiers' tents, but made of the
      boughs of trees stuck in the ground, and bound together on the top with
      withies, and such other things as we could get; the creek was our defence
      on the north, a little brook on the west, and the south and east sides
      were fortified with a bank, which entirely covered our huts; and being
      drawn oblique from the north-west to the south-east, made our city a
      triangle. Behind the bank or line our huts stood, having three other huts
      behind them at a good distance. In one of these, which was a little one,
      and stood further off, we put our gunpowder, and nothing else, for fear of
      danger; in the other, which was bigger, we dressed our victuals, and put
      all our necessaries; and in the third, which was biggest of all, we ate
      our dinners, called our councils, and sat and diverted ourselves with such
      conversation as we had one with another, which was but indifferent truly
      at that time.
    
    
      Our correspondence with the natives was absolutely necessary, and our
      artist the cutler having made abundance of those little diamond-cut
      squares of silver, with these we made shift to traffic with the black
      people for what we wanted; for indeed they were pleased wonderfully with
      them, and thus we got plenty of provisions. At first, and in particular,
      we got about fifty head of black cattle and goats, and our cook's mate
      took care to cure them and dry them, salt and preserve them for our grand
      supply; nor was this hard to do, the salt and saltpetre being very good,
      and the sun excessively hot; and here we lived about four months.
    
    
      The southern solstice was over, and the sun gone back towards the
      equinoctial, when we considered of our next adventure, which was to go
      over the sea of Zanguebar, as the Portuguese call it, and to land, if
      possible, upon the continent of Africa.
    
    
      We talked with many of the natives about it, such as we could make
      ourselves intelligible to, but all that we could learn from them was, that
      there was a great land of lions beyond the sea, but that it was a great
      way off. We knew as well as they that it was a long way, but our people
      differed mightily about it; some said it was 150 leagues, others not above
      100. One of our men, that had a map of the world, showed us by his scale
      that it was not above eighty leagues. Some said there were islands all the
      way to touch at, some that there were no islands at all. For my own part,
      I knew nothing of this matter one way or another, but heard it all without
      concern, whether it was near or far off; however, this we learned from an
      old man who was blind and led about by a boy, that if we stayed till the
      end of August, we should be sure of the wind to be fair and the sea smooth
      all the voyage.
    
    
      This was some encouragement; but staying again was very unwelcome news to
      us, because that then the sun would be returning again to the south, which
      was what our men were very unwilling to. At last we called a council of
      our whole body; their debates were too tedious to take notice of, only to
      note, that when it came to Captain Bob (for so they called me ever since I
      had taken state upon me before one of their great princes), truly I was on
      no side; it was not one farthing matter to me, I told them, whether we
      went or stayed; I had no home, and all the world was alike to me; so I
      left it entirely to them to determine.
    
    
      In a word, they saw plainly there was nothing to be done where we were
      without shipping; that if our business indeed was only to eat and drink,
      we could not find a better place in the world; but if our business was to
      get away, and get home into our country, we could not find a worse.
    
    
      I confess I liked the country wonderfully, and even then had strange
      notions of coming again to live there; and I used to say to them very
      often that if I had but a ship of twenty guns, and a sloop, and both well
      manned, I would not desire a better place in the world to make myself as
      rich as a king.
    
    
      But to return to the consultations they were in about going. Upon the
      whole, it was resolved to venture over for the main; and venture we did,
      madly enough, indeed, for it was the wrong time of the year to undertake
      such a voyage in that country; for, as the winds hang easterly all the
      months from September to March, so they generally hang westerly all the
      rest of the year, and blew right in our teeth; so that, as soon as we had,
      with a kind of a land-breeze, stretched over about fifteen or twenty
      leagues, and, as I may say, just enough to lose ourselves, we found the
      wind set in a steady fresh gale or breeze from the sea, at west, W.S.W.,
      or S.W. by W., and never further from the west; so that, in a word, we
      could make nothing of it.
    
    
      On the other hand, the vessel, such as we had, would not lie close upon a
      wind; if so, we might have stretched away N.N.W., and have met with a
      great many islands in our way, as we found afterwards; but we could make
      nothing of it, though we tried, and by the trying had almost undone us
      all; for, stretching away to the north, as near the wind as we could, we
      had forgotten the shape and position of the island of Madagascar itself;
      how that we came off at the head of a promontory or point of land, that
      lies about the middle of the island, and that stretches out west a great
      way into the sea; and that now, being run a matter of forty leagues to the
      north, the shore of the island fell off again above 200 miles to the east,
      so that we were by this time in the wide ocean, between the island and the
      main, and almost 100 leagues from both.
    
    
      Indeed, as the winds blew fresh at west, as before, we had a smooth sea,
      and we found it pretty good going before it, and so, taking our smallest
      canoe in tow, we stood in for the shore with all the sail we could make.
      This was a terrible adventure, for, if the least gust of wind had come, we
      had been all lost, our canoes being deep and in no condition to make way
      in a high sea.
    
    
      This voyage, however, held us eleven days in all; and at length, having
      spent most of our provisions, and every drop of water we had, we spied
      land, to our great joy, though at the distance of ten or eleven leagues;
      and as, under the land, the wind came off like a land-breeze, and blew
      hard against us, we were two days more before we reached the shore, having
      all that while excessive hot weather, and not a drop of water or any other
      liquor, except some cordial waters, which one of our company had a little
      of left in a case of bottles.
    
    
      This gave us a taste of what we should have done if we had ventured
      forward with a scant wind and uncertain weather, and gave us a surfeit of
      our design for the main, at least until we might have some better vessels
      under us; so we went on shore again, and pitched our camp as before, in as
      convenient manner as we could, fortifying ourselves against any surprise;
      but the natives here were exceeding courteous, and much more civil than on
      the south part of the island; and though we could not understand what they
      said, or they us, yet we found means to make them understand that we were
      seafaring men and strangers, and that we were in distress for want of
      provisions.
    
    
      The first proof we had of their kindness was, that as soon as they saw us
      come on shore and begin to make our habitation, one of their captains or
      kings, for we knew not what to call them, came down with five or six men
      and some women, and brought us five goats and two young fat steers, and
      gave them to us for nothing; and when we went to offer them anything, the
      captain or the king would not let any of them touch it, or take anything
      of us. About two hours after came another king, or captain, with forty or
      fifty men after him. We began to be afraid of him, and laid hands upon our
      weapons; but he perceiving it, caused two men to go before him, carrying
      two long poles in their hands, which they held upright, as high as they
      could, which we presently perceived was a signal of peace; and these two
      poles they set up afterwards, sticking them up in the ground; and when the
      king and his men came to these two poles, they struck all their lances up
      in the ground, and came on unarmed, leaving their lances, as also their
      bows and arrows, behind them.
    
    
      This was to satisfy us that they were come as friends, and we were glad to
      see it, for we had no mind to quarrel with them if we could help it. The
      captain of this gang seeing some of our men making up their huts, and that
      they did it but bunglingly, he beckoned to some of his men to go and help
      us. Immediately fifteen or sixteen of them came and mingled among us, and
      went to work for us; and indeed, they were better workmen than we were,
      for they run up three or four huts for us in a moment, and much handsomer
      done than ours.
    
    
      After this they sent us milk, plantains, pumpkins, and abundance of roots
      and greens that were very good, and then took their leave, and would not
      take anything from us that we had. One of our men offered the king or
      captain of these men a dram, which he drank and was mightily pleased with
      it, and held out his hand for another, which we gave him; and in a word,
      after this, he hardly failed coming to us two or three times a week,
      always bringing us something or other; and one time sent us seven head of
      black cattle, some of which we cured and dried as before.
    
    
      And here I cannot but remember one thing, which afterwards stood us in
      great stead, viz., that the flesh of their goats, and their beef also, but
      especially the former, when we had dried and cured it, looked red, and ate
      hard and firm, as dried beef in Holland; they were so pleased with it, and
      it was such a dainty to them, that at any time after they would trade with
      us for it, not knowing, or so much as imagining what it was; so that for
      ten or twelve pounds' weight of smoke-dried beef, they would give us a
      whole bullock, or cow, or anything else we could desire.
    
    
      Here we observed two things that were very material to us, even
      essentially so; first, we found they had a great deal of earthenware here,
      which they made use of many ways as we did; particularly they had long,
      deep earthen pots, which they used to sink into the ground, to keep the
      water which they drunk cool and pleasant; and the other was, that they had
      larger canoes than their neighbours had.
    
    
      By this we were prompted to inquire if they had no larger vessels than
      those we saw there, or if any other of the inhabitants had not such. They
      signified presently that they had no larger boats than that they showed
      us; but that on the other side of the island they had larger boats, and
      that with decks upon them, and large sails; and this made us resolve to
      coast round the whole island to see them; so we prepared and victualled
      our canoe for the voyage, and, in a word, went to sea for the third time.
    
    
      It cost us a month or six weeks' time to perform this voyage, in which
      time we went on shore several times for water and provisions, and found
      the natives always very free and courteous; but we were surprised one
      morning early, being at the extremity of the northernmost part of the
      island, when one of our men cried out, "A sail! a sail!" We presently saw
      a vessel a great way out at sea; but after we had looked at it with our
      perspective glasses, and endeavoured all we could to make out what it was,
      we could not tell what to think of it; for it was neither ship, ketch,
      galley, galliot, or like anything that we had ever seen before; all that
      we could make of it was, that it went from us, standing out to sea. In a
      word, we soon lost sight of it, for we were in no condition to chase
      anything, and we never saw it again; but, by all that we could perceive of
      it, from what we saw of such things afterwards, it was some Arabian
      vessel, which had been trading to the coast of Mozambique, or Zanzibar,
      the same place where we afterwards went, as you shall hear.
    
    
      I kept no journal of this voyage, nor indeed did I all this while
      understand anything of navigation, more than the common business of a
      foremast-man; so I can say nothing to the latitudes or distances of any
      places we were at, how long we were going, or how far we sailed in a day;
      but this I remember, that being now come round the island, we sailed up
      the eastern shore due south, as we had done down the western shore due
      north before.
    
    
      Nor do I remember that the natives differed much from one another, either
      in stature or complexion, or in their manners, their habits, their
      weapons, or indeed in anything; and yet we could not perceive that they
      had any intelligence one with another; but they were extremely kind and
      civil to us on this side, as well as on the other.
    
    
      We continued our voyage south for many weeks, though with several
      intervals of going on shore to get provisions and water. At length, coming
      round a point of land which lay about a league further than ordinary into
      the sea, we were agreeably surprised with a sight which, no doubt, had
      been as disagreeable to those concerned, as it was pleasant to us. This
      was the wreck of an European ship, which had been cast away upon the
      rocks, which in that place run a great way into the sea.
    
    
      We could see plainly, at low water, a great deal of the ship lay dry; even
      at high water, she was not entirely covered; and that at most she did not
      lie above a league from the shore. It will easily be believed that our
      curiosity led us, the wind and weather also permitting, to go directly to
      her, which we did without any difficulty, and presently found that it was
      a Dutch-built ship, and that she could not have been very long in that
      condition, a great deal of the upper work of her stern remaining firm,
      with the mizzen-mast standing. Her stern seemed to be jammed in between
      two ridges of the rock, and so remained fast, all the fore part of the
      ship having been beaten to pieces.
    
    
      We could see nothing to be gotten out of the wreck that was worth our
      while; but we resolved to go on shore, and stay some time thereabouts, to
      see if perhaps we might get any light into the story of her; and we were
      not without hopes that we might hear something more particular about her
      men, and perhaps find some of them on shore there, in the same condition
      that we were in, and so might increase our company.
    
    
      It was a very pleasant sight to us when, coming on shore, we saw all the
      marks and tokens of a ship-carpenter's yard; as a launch-block and
      cradles, scaffolds and planks, and pieces of planks, the remains of the
      building a ship or vessel; and, in a word, a great many things that fairly
      invited us to go about the same work; and we soon came to understand that
      the men belonging to the ship that was lost had saved themselves on shore,
      perhaps in their boat, and had built themselves a barque or sloop, and so
      were gone to sea again; and, inquiring of the natives which way they went,
      they pointed to the south and south-west, by which we could easily
      understand they were gone away to the Cape of Good Hope.
    
    
      Nobody will imagine we could be so dull as not to gather from hence that
      we might take the same method for our escape; so we resolved first, in
      general, that we would try if possible to build us a boat of one kind or
      other, and go to sea as our fate should direct.
    
    
      In order to this our first work was to have the two carpenters search
      about to see what materials the Dutchmen had left behind them that might
      be of use; and, in particular, they found one that was very useful, and
      which I was much employed about, and that was a pitch-kettle, and a little
      pitch in it.
    
    
      When we came to set close to this work we found it very laborious and
      difficult, having but few tools, no ironwork, no cordage, no sails; so
      that, in short, whatever we built, we were obliged to be our own smiths,
      rope-makers, sail-makers, and indeed to practise twenty trades that we
      knew little or nothing of. However, necessity was the spur to invention,
      and we did many things which before we thought impracticable, that is to
      say, in our circumstances.
    
    
      After our two carpenters had resolved upon the dimensions of what they
      would build, they set us all to work, to go off in our boats and split up
      the wreck of the old ship, and to bring away everything we could; and
      particularly that, if possible, we should bring away the mizzen-mast,
      which was left standing, which with much difficulty we effected, after
      above twenty days' labour of fourteen of our men.
    
    
      At the same time we got out a great deal of ironwork, as bolts, spikes,
      nails,      c., all of which our artist, of whom I have spoken already,
      who was now grown a very dexterous smith, made us nails and hinges for our
      rudder, and spikes such as we wanted.
    
    
      But we wanted an anchor, and if we had had an anchor, we could not have
      made a cable; so we contented ourselves with making some ropes with the
      help of the natives, of such stuff as they made their mats of, and with
      these we made such a kind of cable or tow-line as was sufficient to fasten
      our vessel to the shore, which we contented ourselves with for that time.
    
    
      To be short, we spent four months here, and worked very hard too; at the
      end of which time we launched our frigate, which, in a few words, had many
      defects, but yet, all things considered, it was as well as we could expect
      it to be.
    
    
      In short, it was a kind of sloop, of the burthen of near eighteen or
      twenty tons; and had we had masts and sails, standing and running rigging,
      as is usual in such cases, and other conveniences, the vessel might have
      carried us wherever we could have had a mind to go; but of all the
      materials we wanted, this was the worst, viz., that we had no tar or pitch
      to pay the seams and secure the bottom; and though we did what we could,
      with tallow and oil, to make a mixture to supply that part, yet we could
      not bring it to answer our end fully; and when we launched her into the
      water, she was so leaky, and took in the water so fast, that we thought
      all our labour had been lost, for we had much ado to make her swim; and as
      for pumps, we had none, nor had we any means to make one.
    
    
      But at length one of the natives, a black negro-man, showed us a tree, the
      wood of which being put into the fire, sends forth a liquid that is as
      glutinous and almost as strong as tar, and of which, by boiling, we made a
      sort of stuff which served us for pitch, and this answered our end
      effectually; for we perfectly made our vessel sound and tight, so that we
      wanted no pitch or tar at all. This secret has stood me in stead upon many
      occasions since that time in the same place.
    
    
      Our vessel being thus finished, out of the mizzen-mast of the ship we made
      a very good mast to her, and fitted our sails to it as well as we could;
      then we made a rudder and tiller, and, in a word, everything that our
      present necessity called upon us for; and having victualled her, and put
      as much fresh water on board as we thought we wanted, or as we knew how to
      stow (for we were yet without casks), we put to sea with a fair wind.
    
    
      We had spent near another year in these rambles, and in this piece of
      work; for it was now, as our men said, about the beginning of our
      February, and the sun went from us apace, which was much to our
      satisfaction, for the heats were exceedingly violent. The wind, as I said,
      was fair; for, as I have since learned, the winds generally spring up to
      the eastward, as the sun goes from them to the north.
    
    
      Our debate now was, which way we should go, and never were men so
      irresolute; some were for going to the east, and stretching away directly
      for the coast of Malabar; but others, who considered more seriously the
      length of that voyage, shook their heads at the proposal, knowing very
      well that neither our provisions, especially of water, or our vessel, were
      equal to such a run as that is, of near 2000 miles without any land to
      touch at in the way.
    
    
      These men, too, had all along had a great mind to a voyage for the
      mainland of Africa, where they said we should have a fair cast for our
      lives, and might be sure to make ourselves rich, which way soever we went,
      if we were but able to make our way through, whether by sea or by land.
    
    
      Besides, as the case stood with us, we had not much choice for our way;
      for, if we had resolved for the east, we were at the wrong season of the
      year, and must have stayed till April or May before we had gone to sea. At
      length, as we had the wind at S.E. and E.S.E., and fine promising weather,
      we came all into the first proposal, and resolved for the coast of Africa;
      nor were we long in disputing as to our coasting the island which we were
      upon, for we were now upon the wrong side of the island for the voyage we
      intended; so we stood away to the north, and, having rounded the cape, we
      hauled away southward, under the lee of the island, thinking to reach the
      west point of land, which, as I observed before, runs out so far towards
      the coast of Africa, as would have shortened our run almost 100 leagues.
      But when we had sailed about thirty leagues, we found the winds variable
      under the shore, and right against us, so we concluded to stand over
      directly, for then we had the wind fair, and our vessel was but very ill
      fated to lie near the wind, or any way indeed but just before it.
    
    
      Having resolved upon it, therefore, we put into the shore to furnish
      ourselves again with fresh water and other provisions, and about the
      latter end of March, with more courage than discretion, more resolution
      than judgment, we launched for the main coast of Africa.
    
    
      As for me, I had no anxieties about it, so that we had but a view of
      reaching some land or other, I cared not what or where it was to be,
      having at this time no views of what was before me, nor much thought of
      what might or might not befall me; but with as little consideration as any
      one can be supposed to have at my age, I consented to everything that was
      proposed, however hazardous the thing itself, however improbable the
      success.
    
    
      The voyage, as it was undertaken with a great deal of ignorance and
      desperation, so really it was not carried on with much resolution or
      judgment; for we knew no more of the course we were to steer than this,
      that it was anywhere about the west, within two or three points N. or S.,
      and as we had no compass with us but a little brass pocket compass, which
      one of our men had more by accident than otherwise, so we could not be
      very exact in our course.
    
    
      However, as it pleased God that the wind continued fair at S.E. and by E.,
      we found that N.W. by W., which was right afore it, was as good a course
      for us as any we could go, and thus we went on.
    
    
      The voyage was much longer than we expected; our vessel also, which had no
      sail that was proportioned to her, made but very little way in the sea,
      and sailed heavily. We had, indeed, no great adventures happened in this
      voyage, being out of the way of everything that could offer to divert us;
      and as for seeing any vessel, we had not the least occasion to hail
      anything in all the voyage; for we saw not one vessel, small or great, the
      sea we were upon being entirely out of the way of all commerce; for the
      people of Madagascar knew no more of the shores of Africa than we did,
      only that there was a country of lions, as they call it, that way.
    
    
      We had been eight or nine days under sail, with a fair wind, when, to our
      great joy, one of our men cried out "Land!" We had great reason to be glad
      of the discovery, for we had not water enough left for above two or three
      days more, though at a short allowance. However, though it was early in
      the morning when we discovered it, we made it near night before we reached
      it, the wind slackening almost to a calm, and our ship being, as I said, a
      very dull sailer.
    
    
      We were sadly baulked upon our coming to the land, when we found that,
      instead of the mainland of Africa, it was only a little island, with no
      inhabitants upon it, at least none that we could find; nor any cattle,
      except a few goats, of which we killed three only. However, they served us
      for fresh meat, and we found very good water; and it was fifteen days more
      before we reached the main, which, however, at last we arrived at, and
      which was most essential to us, as we came to it just as all our
      provisions were spent. Indeed, we may say they were spent first, for we
      had but a pint of water a day to each man for the last two days. But, to
      our great joy, we saw the land, though at a great distance, the evening
      before, and by a pleasant gale in the night were by morning within two
      leagues of the shore.
    
    
      We never scrupled going ashore at the first place we came at, though, had
      we had patience, we might have found a very fine river a little farther
      north. However, we kept our frigate on float by the help of two great
      poles, which we fastened into the ground to moor her, like poles; and the
      little weak ropes, which, as I said, we had made of matting, served us
      well enough to make the vessel fast.
    
    
      As soon as we had viewed the country a little, got fresh water, and
      furnished ourselves with some victuals, which we found very scarce here,
      we went on board again with our stores. All we got for provision was some
      fowls that we killed, and a kind of wild buffalo or bull, very small, but
      good meat; I say, having got these things on board, we resolved to sail
      along the coast, which lay N.N.E., till we found some creek or river, that
      we might run up into the country, or some town or people; for we had
      reason enough to know the place was inhabited, because we several times
      saw fires in the night, and smoke in the day, every way at a distance from
      us.
    
    
      At length we came to a very large bay, and in it several little creeks or
      rivers emptying themselves into the sea, and we ran boldly into the first
      creek we came at; where, seeing some huts and wild people about them on
      the shore, we ran our vessel into a little cove on the north side of the
      creek, and held up a long pole, with a white bit of cloth on it, for a
      signal of peace to them. We found they understood us presently, for they
      came flocking to us, men, women, and children, most of them, of both
      sexes, stark naked. At first they stood wondering and staring at us, as if
      we had been monsters, and as if they had been frighted; but we found they
      inclined to be familiar with us afterwards. The first thing we did to try
      them, was, we held up our hands to our mouths, as if we were to drink,
      signifying that we wanted water. This they understood presently, and three
      of their women and two boys ran away up the land, and came back in about
      half a quarter of an hour, with several pots, made of earth, pretty
      enough, and baked, I suppose, in the sun; these they brought us full of
      water, and set them down near the sea-shore, and there left them, going
      back a little, that we might fetch them, which we did.
    
    
      Some time after this, they brought us roots and herbs, and some fruits
      which I cannot remember, and gave us; but as we had nothing to give them,
      we found them not so free as the people in Madagascar were. However, our
      cutler went to work, and, as he had saved some iron out of the wreck of
      the ship, he made abundance of toys, birds, dogs, pins, hooks, and rings;
      and we helped to file them, and make them bright for him, and when we gave
      them some of these, they brought us all sorts of provisions they had, such
      as goats, hogs, and cows, and we got victuals enough.
    
    
      We were now landed upon the continent of Africa, the most desolate,
      desert, and inhospitable country in the world, even Greenland and Nova
      Zembla itself not excepted, with this difference only, that even the worst
      part of it we found inhabited, though, taking the nature and quality of
      some of the inhabitants, it might have been much better to us if there had
      been none.
    
    
      And, to add to the exclamation I am making on the nature of the place, it
      was here that we took one of the rashest, and wildest, and most desperate
      resolutions that ever was taken by man, or any number of men, in the
      world; this was, to travel overland through the heart of the country, from
      the coast of Mozambique, on the east ocean, to the coast of Angola or
      Guinea, on the western or Atlantic Ocean, a continent of land of at least
      1800 miles, in which journey we had excessive heats to support, unpassable
      deserts to go over, no carriages, camels, or beasts of any kind to carry
      our baggage, innumerable numbers of wild and ravenous beasts to encounter
      with, such as lions, leopards, tigers, lizards, and elephants; we had the
      equinoctial line to pass under, and, consequently, were in the very centre
      of the torrid zone; we had nations of savages to encounter with, barbarous
      and brutish to the last degree; hunger and thirst to struggle with, and,
      in one word, terrors enough to have daunted the stoutest hearts that ever
      were placed in cases of flesh and blood.
    
    
      Yet, fearless of all these, we resolved to adventure, and accordingly made
      such preparations for our journey as the place we were in would allow us,
      and such as our little experience of the country seemed to dictate to us.
    
    
      It had been some time already that we had been used to tread barefooted
      upon the rocks, the gravel, the grass, and the sand on the shore; but as
      we found the worst thing for our feet was the walking or travelling on the
      dry burning sands, within the country, so we provided ourselves with a
      sort of shoes, made of the skins of wild beasts, with the hair inward, and
      being dried in the sun, the outsides were thick and hard, and would last a
      great while. In short, as I called them, so I think the term very proper
      still, we made us gloves for our feet, and we found them very convenient
      and very comfortable.
    
    
      We conversed with some of the natives of the country, who were friendly
      enough. What tongue they spoke I do not yet pretend to know. We talked as
      far as we could make them understand us, not only about our provisions,
      but also about our undertaking, and asked them what country lay that way,
      pointing west with our hands. They told us but little to our purpose, only
      we thought, by all their discourse, that there were people to be found, of
      one sort or other, everywhere; that there were many great rivers, many
      lions and tigers, elephants, and furious wild cats (which in the end we
      found to be civet cats), and the like.
    
    
      When we asked them if any one had ever travelled that way, they told us
      yes, some had gone to where the sun sleeps, meaning to the west, but they
      could not tell us who they were. When we asked for some to guide us, they
      shrunk up their shoulders as Frenchmen do when they are afraid to
      undertake a thing. When we asked them about the lions and wild creatures,
      they laughed, and let us know that they would do us no hurt, and directed
      us to a good way indeed to deal with them, and that was to make some fire,
      which would always fright them away; and so indeed we found it.
    
    
      Upon these encouragements we resolved upon our journey, and many
      considerations put us upon it, which, had the thing itself been
      practicable, we were not so much to blame for as it might otherwise be
      supposed; I will name some of them, not to make the account too tedious.
    
    
      First, we were perfectly destitute of means to work about our own
      deliverance any other way; we were on shore in a place perfectly remote
      from all European navigation; so that we could never think of being
      relieved, and fetched off by any of our own countrymen in that part of the
      world. Secondly, if we had adventured to have sailed on along the coast of
      Mozambique, and the desolate shores of Africa to the north, till we came
      to the Red Sea, all we could hope for there was to be taken by the Arabs,
      and be sold for slaves to the Turks, which to all of us was little better
      than death. We could not build anything of a vessel that would carry us
      over the great Arabian Sea to India, nor could we reach the Cape de Bona
      Speranza, the winds being too variable, and the sea in that latitude too
      tempestuous; but we all knew, if we could cross this continent of land, we
      might reach some of the great rivers that run into the Atlantic Ocean; and
      that, on the banks of any of those rivers, we might there build us canoes
      which would carry us down, if it were thousands of miles, so that we could
      want nothing but food, of which we were assured we might kill sufficient
      with our guns; and to add to the satisfaction of our deliverance, we
      concluded we might, every one of us, get a quantity of gold, which, if we
      came safe, would infinitely recompense us for our toil.
    
    
      I cannot say that in all our consultations I ever began to enter into the
      weight and merit of any enterprise we went upon till now. My view before
      was, as I thought, very good, viz., that we should get into the Arabian
      Gulf, or the mouth of the Red Sea; and waiting for some vessel passing or
      repassing there, of which there is plenty, have seized upon the first we
      came at by force, and not only have enriched ourselves with her cargo, but
      have carried ourselves to what part of the world we had pleased; but when
      they came to talk to me of a march of 2000 or 3000 miles on foot, of
      wandering in deserts among lions and tigers, I confess my blood ran chill,
      and I used all the arguments I could to persuade them against it.
    
    
      But they were all positive, and I might as well have held my tongue; so I
      submitted, and told them I would keep to our first law, to be governed by
      the majority, and we resolved upon our journey. The first thing we did was
      to take an observation, and see whereabouts in the world we were, which we
      did, and found we were in the latitude of 12 degrees 35 minutes south of
      the line. The next thing was to look on the charts, and see the coast of
      the country we aimed at, which we found to be from 8 to 11 degrees south
      latitude, if we went for the coast of Angola, or in 12 to 29 degrees north
      latitude, if we made for the river Niger, and the coast of Guinea.
    
    
      Our aim was for the coast of Angola, which, by the charts we had, lying
      very near the same latitude we were then in, our course thither was due
      west; and as we were assured we should meet with rivers, we doubted not
      but that by their help we might ease our journey, especially if we could
      find means to cross the great lake, or inland sea, which the natives call
      Coalmucoa, out of which it is said the river Nile has its source or
      beginning; but we reckoned without our host, as you will see in the sequel
      of our story.
    
    
      The next thing we had to consider was, how to carry our baggage, which we
      were first of all determined not to travel without; neither indeed was it
      possible for us to do so, for even our ammunition, which was absolutely
      necessary to us, and on which our subsistence, I mean for food, as well as
      our safety, and particularly our defence against wild beasts and wild men,
      depended,       I say, even our ammunition was a load too heavy for us to
      carry in a country where the heat was such that we should be load enough
      for ourselves.
    
    
      We inquired in the country, and found there was no beast of burthen known
      among them, that is to say, neither horses or mules, or asses, camels, or
      dromedaries; the only creature they had was a kind of buffalo, or tame
      bull, such a one as we had killed; and that some of these they had brought
      so to their hand, that they taught them to go and come with their voices,
      as they called them to them, or sent them from them; that they made them
      carry burthens; and particularly that they would swim over rivers and
      lakes upon them, the creatures swimming very high and strong in the water.
    
    
      But we understood nothing of the management of guiding such a creature, or
      how to bind a burthen upon them; and this last part of our consultation
      puzzled us extremely. At last I proposed a method for them, which, after
      some consideration, they found very convenient; and this was, to quarrel
      with some of the negro natives, take ten or twelve of them prisoners, and
      binding them as slaves, cause them to travel with us, and make them carry
      our baggage; which I alleged would be convenient and useful many ways as
      well to show us the way, as to converse with other natives for us.
    
    
      This counsel was not accepted at first, but the natives soon gave them
      reason to approve it, and also gave them an opportunity to put it in
      practice; for, as our little traffic with the natives was hitherto upon
      the faith of their first kindness, we found some knavery among them at
      last; for having bought some cattle of them for our toys, which, as I
      said, our cutler had contrived, one of our men differing with his chapman,
      truly they huffed him in their manner, and, keeping the things he had
      offered them for the cattle, made their fellows drive away the cattle
      before his face, and laugh at him. Our man crying out loud of this
      violence, and calling to some of us who were not far off, the negro he was
      dealing with threw a lance at him, which came so true, that, if he had not
      with great agility jumped aside, and held up his hand also to turn the
      lance as it came, it had struck through his body; and, as it was, it
      wounded him in the arm; at which the man, enraged, took up his fuzee, and
      shot the negro through the heart.
    
    
      The others that were near him, and all those that were with us at a
      distance, were so terribly frighted, first, at the flash of fire;
      secondly, at the noise; and thirdly, at seeing their countryman killed,
      that they stood like men stupid and amazed, at first, for some time; but
      after they were a little recovered from their fright, one of them, at a
      good distance from us, set up a sudden screaming noise, which, it seems,
      is the noise they make when they go to fight; and all the rest
      understanding what he meant, answered him, and ran together to the place
      where he was, and we not knowing what it meant, stood still, looking upon
      one another like a parcel of fools.
    
    
      But we were presently undeceived; for, in two or three minutes more, we
      heard the screaming roaring noise go on from one place to another, through
      all their little towns; nay, even over the creek to the other side; and,
      on a sudden, we saw a naked multitude running from all parts to the place
      where the first man began it, as to a rendezvous; and, in less than an
      hour, I believe there was near 500 of them gotten together, armed some
      with bows and arrows, but most with lances, which they throw at a good
      distance, so nicely that they will strike a bird flying.
    
    
      We had but a very little time for consultation, for the multitude was
      increasing every moment; and I verily believe, if we had stayed long, they
      would have been 10,000 together in a little time. We had nothing to do,
      therefore, but to fly to our ship or bark, where indeed we could have
      defended ourselves very well, or to advance and try what a volley or two
      of small shot would do for us.
    
    
      We resolved immediately upon the latter, depending upon it that the fire
      and terror of our shot would soon put them to flight; so we drew up all in
      a line, and marched boldly up to them. They stood ready to meet us,
      depending, I suppose, to destroy us all with their lances; but before we
      came near enough for them to throw their lances, we halted, and, standing
      at a good distance from one another, to stretch our line as far as we
      could, we gave them a salute with our shot, which, besides what we wounded
      that we knew not of, knocked sixteen of them down upon the spot, and three
      more were so lamed, that they fell about twenty or thirty yards from them.
    
    
      As soon as we had fired, they set up the horridest yell, or howling,
      partly raised by those that were wounded, and partly by those that pitied
      and condoled the bodies they saw lie dead, that I never heard anything
      like it before or since.
    
    
      We stood stock still after we had fired, to load our guns again, and
      finding they did not stir from the place we fired among them again; we
      killed about nine of them at the second fire; but as they did not stand so
      thick as before, all our men did not fire, seven of us being ordered to
      reserve our charge, and to advance as soon as the other had fired, while
      the rest loaded again; of which I shall speak again presently.
    
    
      As soon as we had fired the second volley, we shouted as loud as we could,
      and the seven men advanced upon them, and, coming about twenty yards
      nearer, fired again, and those that were behind having loaded again with
      all expedition, followed; but when they saw us advance, they ran screaming
      away as if they were bewitched.
    
    
      When we came up to the field of battle, we saw a great number of bodies
      lying upon the ground, many more than we could suppose were killed or
      wounded; nay, more than we had bullets in our pieces when we fired; and we
      could not tell what to make of it; but at length we found how it was,
      viz., that they were frighted out of all manner of sense; nay, I do
      believe several of those that were really dead, were frighted to death,
      and had no wound about them.
    
    
      Of those that were thus frighted, as I have said, several of them, as they
      recovered themselves, came and worshipped us (taking us for gods or
      devils, I know not which, nor did it much matter to us): some kneeling,
      some throwing themselves flat on the ground, made a thousand antic
      gestures, but all with tokens of the most profound submission. It
      presently came into my head, that we might now, by the law of arms, take
      as many prisoners as we would, and make them travel with us, and carry our
      baggage. As soon as I proposed it, our men were all of my mind; and
      accordingly we secured about sixty lusty young fellows, and let them know
      they must go with us; which they seemed very willing to do. But the next
      question we had among ourselves, was, how we should do to trust them, for
      we found the people not like those of Madagascar, but fierce, revengeful,
      and treacherous; for which reason we were sure that we should have no
      service from them but that of mere slaves; no subjection that would
      continue any longer than the fear of us was upon them, nor any labour but
      by violence.
    
    
      Before I go any farther, I must hint to the reader, that from this time
      forward I began to enter a little more seriously into the circumstance I
      was in, and concerned myself more in the conduct of our affairs; for
      though my comrades were all older men, yet I began to find them void of
      counsel, or, as I now call it, presence of mind, when they came to the
      execution of a thing. The first occasion I took to observe this, was in
      their late engagement with the natives, when, though they had taken a good
      resolution to attack them and fire upon them, yet, when they had fired the
      first time, and found that the negroes did not run as they expected, their
      hearts began to fail, and I am persuaded, if their bark had been near
      hand, they would every man have run away.
    
    
      Upon this occasion I began to take upon me a little to hearten them up,
      and to call upon them to load again, and give them another volley, telling
      them that I would engage, if they would be ruled by me, I'd make the
      negroes run fast enough. I found this heartened them, and therefore, when
      they fired a second time, I desired them to reserve some of their shot for
      an attempt by itself, as I mentioned above.
    
    
      Having fired a second time, I was indeed forced to command, as I may call
      it. "Now, seigniors," said I, "let us give them a cheer." So I opened my
      throat, and shouted three times, as our English sailors do on like
      occasions. "And now follow me," said I to the seven that had not fired,
      "and I'll warrant you we will make work with them," and so it proved
      indeed; for, as soon as they saw us coming, away they ran, as above.
    
    
      From this day forward they would call me nothing but Seignior Capitanio;
      but I told them I would not be called seignior. "Well, then," said the
      gunner, who spoke good English, "you shall be called Captain Bob;" and so
      they gave me my title ever after.
    
    
      Nothing is more certain of the Portuguese than this, take them nationally
      or personally, if they are animated and heartened up by anybody to go
      before, and encourage them by example, they will behave well enough; but
      if they have nothing but their own measures to follow, they sink
      immediately: these men had certainly fled from a parcel of naked savages,
      though even by flying they could not have saved their lives, if I had not
      shouted and hallooed, and rather made sport with the thing than a fight,
      to keep up their courage.
    
    
      Nor was there less need of it upon several occasions hereafter; and I do
      confess I have often wondered how a number of men, who, when they came to
      the extremity, were so ill supported by their own spirits, had at first
      courage to propose and to undertake the most desperate and impracticable
      attempt that ever men went about in the world.
    
    
      There were indeed two or three indefatigable men among them, by whose
      courage and industry all the rest were upheld; and indeed those two or
      three were the managers of them from the beginning; that was the gunner,
      and that cutler whom I call the artist; and the third, who was pretty
      well, though not like either of them, was one of the carpenters. These
      indeed were the life and soul of all the rest, and it was to their courage
      that all the rest owed the resolution they showed upon any occasion. But
      when those saw me take a little upon me, as above, they embraced me, and
      treated me with particular affection ever after.
    
    
      This gunner was an excellent mathematician, a good scholar, and a complete
      sailor; and it was in conversing intimately with him that I learned
      afterwards the grounds of what knowledge I have since had in all the
      sciences useful for navigation, and particularly in the geographical part
      of knowledge.
    
    
      Even in our conversation, finding me eager to understand and learn, he
      laid the foundation of a general knowledge of things in my mind, gave me
      just ideas of the form of the earth and of the sea, the situation of
      countries, the course of rivers, the doctrine of the spheres, the motion
      of the stars; and, in a word, taught me a kind of system of astronomy,
      which I afterwards improved.
    
    
      In an especial manner, he filled my head with aspiring thoughts, and with
      an earnest desire after learning everything that could be taught me;
      convincing me, that nothing could qualify me for great undertakings, but a
      degree of learning superior to what was usual in the race of seamen; he
      told me, that to be ignorant was to be certain of a mean station in the
      world, but that knowledge was the first step to preferment. He was always
      flattering me with my capacity to learn; and though that fed my pride,
      yet, on the other hand, as I had a secret ambition, which just at that
      time fed itself in my mind, it prompted in me an insatiable thirst after
      learning in general, and I resolved, if ever I came back to Europe, and
      had anything left to purchase it, I would make myself master of all the
      parts of learning needful to the making of me a complete sailor; but I was
      not so just to myself afterwards as to do it when I had an opportunity.
    
    
      But to return to our business; the gunner, when he saw the service I had
      done in the fight, and heard my proposal for keeping a number of prisoners
      for our march, and for carrying our baggage, turns to me before them all.
      "Captain Bob," says he, "I think you must be our leader, for all the
      success of this enterprise is owing to you." "No, no," said I, "do not
      compliment me; you shall be our Seignior Capitanio, you shall be general;
      I am too young for it." So, in short, we all agreed he should be our
      leader; but he would not accept of it alone, but would have me joined with
      him; and all the rest agreeing, I was obliged to comply.
    
    
      The first piece of service they put me upon in this new command was as
      difficult as any they could think of, and that was to manage the
      prisoners; which, however, I cheerfully undertook, as you shall hear
      presently. But the immediate consultation was yet of more consequence; and
      that was, first, which way we should go; and secondly, how to furnish
      ourselves for the voyage with provisions.
    
    
      There was among the prisoners one tall, well-shaped, handsome fellow, to
      whom the rest seemed to pay great respect, and who, as we understood
      afterwards, was the son of one of their kings; his father was, it seems,
      killed at our first volley, and he wounded with a shot in his arm, and
      with another just on one of his hips or haunches. The shot in his haunch
      being in a fleshy part, bled much, and he was half dead with the loss of
      blood. As to the shot in his arm, it had broke his wrist, and he was by
      both these wounds quite disabled, so that we were once going to turn him
      away, and let him die; and, if we had, he would have died indeed in a few
      days more: but, as I found the man had some respect showed him, it
      presently occurred to my thoughts that we might bring him to be useful to
      us, and perhaps make him a kind of commander over them. So I caused our
      surgeon to take him in hand, and gave the poor wretch good words, that is
      to say, I spoke to him as well as I could by signs, to make him understand
      that we would make him well again.
    
    
      This created a new awe in their minds of us, believing that, as we could
      kill at a distance by something invisible to them (for so our shot was, to
      be sure), so we could make them well again too. Upon this the young prince
      (for so we called him afterwards) called six or seven of the savages to
      him, and said something to them; what it was we know not, but immediately
      all the seven came to me, and kneeled down to me, holding up their hands,
      and making signs of entreaty, pointing to the place where one of those lay
      whom we had killed.
    
    
      It was a long time before I or any of us could understand them; but one of
      them ran and lifted up a dead man, pointing to his wound, which was in his
      eyes, for he was shot into the head at one of his eyes. Then another
      pointed to the surgeon, and at last we found it out, that the meaning was,
      that he should heal the prince's father too, who was dead, being shot
      through the head, as above.
    
    
      We presently took the hint, and would not say we could not do it, but let
      them know, the men that were killed were those that had first fallen upon
      us, and provoked us, and we would by no means make them alive again; and
      that, if any others did so, we would kill them too, and never let them
      live any more: but that, if he (the prince) would be willing to go with
      us, and do as we should direct him, we would not let him die, and would
      make his arm well. Upon this he bid his men go and fetch a long stick or
      staff, and lay on the ground. When they brought it, we saw it was an
      arrow; he took it with his left hand (for his other was lame with the
      wound), and, pointing up at the sun, broke the arrow in two, and set the
      point against his breast, and then gave it to me. This was, as I
      understood afterwards, wishing the sun, whom they worship, might shoot him
      into the breast with an arrow, if ever he failed to be my friend; and
      giving the point of the arrow to me was to be a testimony that I was the
      man he had sworn to: and never was Christian more punctual to an oath than
      he was to this, for he was a sworn servant to us for many a weary month
      after that.
    
    
      When I brought him to the surgeon, he immediately dressed the wound in his
      haunch or buttock, and found the bullet had only grazed upon the flesh,
      and passed, as it were, by it, but it was not lodged in the part, so that
      it was soon healed and well again; but, as to his arm, he found one of the
      bones broken, which are in the fore-part from the wrist to the elbow; and
      this he set, and splintered it up, and bound his arm in a sling, hanging
      it about his neck, and making signs to him that he should not stir it;
      which he was so strict an observer of, that he set him down, and never
      moved one way or other but as the surgeon gave him leave.
    
    
      I took a great deal of pains to acquaint this negro what we intended to
      do, and what use we intended to make of his men; and particularly to teach
      him the meaning of what we said, especially to teach him some words, such
      as yes and no, and what they meant, and to inure him to our way of
      talking; and he was very willing and apt to learn anything I taught him.
    
    
      It was easy to let him see that we intended to carry our provision with us
      from the first day; but he made signs to us to tell us we need not, for we
      should find provision enough everywhere for forty days. It was very
      difficult for us to understand how he expressed forty; for he knew no
      figures, but some words that they used to one another that they understood
      it by. At last one of the negroes, by his order, laid forty little stones
      one by another, to show us how many days we should travel, and find
      provisions sufficient.
    
    
      Then I showed him our baggage, which was very heavy, particularly our
      powder, shot, lead, iron, carpenters' tools, seamen's instruments, cases
      of bottles, and other lumber. He took some of the things up in his hand to
      feel the weight, and shook his head at them; so I told our people they
      must resolve to divide their things into small parcels, and make them
      portable; and accordingly they did so, by which means we were fain to
      leave all our chests behind us, which were eleven in number.
    
    
      Then he made signs to us that he would procure some buffaloes, or young
      bulls, as I called them, to carry things for us, and made signs, too, that
      if we were weary, we might be carried too; but that we slighted, only were
      willing to have the creatures, because, at last, when they could serve us
      no farther for carriage, we might eat them all up if we had any occasion
      for them.
    
    
      I then carried him to our bark, and showed him what things we had here. He
      seemed amazed at the sight of our bark, having never seen anything of that
      kind before, for their boats are most wretched things, such as I never saw
      before, having no head or stern, and being made only of the skins of
      goats, sewed together with dried guts of goats and sheep, and done over
      with a kind of slimy stuff like rosin and oil, but of a most nauseous,
      odious smell; and they are poor miserable things for boats, the worst that
      any part of the world ever saw; a canoe is an excellent contrivance
      compared to them.
    
    
      But to return to our boat. We carried our new prince into it, and helped
      him over the side, because of his lameness. We made signs to him that his
      men must carry our goods for us, and showed him what we had; he answered,
      "Si, Seignior," or, "Yes, sir" (for we had taught him that word and the
      meaning of it), and taking up a bundle, he made signs to us, that when his
      arm was well he would carry some for us.
    
    
      I made signs again to tell him, that if he would make his men carry them,
      we would not let him carry anything. We had secured all the prisoners in a
      narrow place, where we had bound them with mat cords, and set up stakes
      like a palisado round them; so, when we carried the prince on shore, we
      went with him to them, and made signs to him to ask them if they were
      willing to go with us to the country of lions. Accordingly he made a long
      speech to them, and we could understand by it that he told them, if they
      were willing, they must say, "Si, Seignior," telling them what it
      signified. They immediately answered, "Si, Seignior," and clapped their
      hands, looking up to the sun, which, the prince signified to us, was
      swearing to be faithful. But as soon as they had said so, one of them made
      a long speech to the prince; and in it we perceived, by his gestures,
      which were very antic, that they desired something from us, and that they
      were in great concern about it. So I asked him, as well as I could, what
      it was they desired of us; he told us by signs that they desired we should
      clap our hands to the sun (that was, to swear) that we would not kill
      them, that we would give them chiaruck, that is to say, bread, would not
      starve them, and would not let the lions eat them. I told him we would
      promise all that; then he pointed to the sun, and clapped his hands,
      signing to me that I should do so too, which I did; at which all the
      prisoners fell flat on the ground, and rising up again, made the oddest,
      wildest cries that ever I heard.
    
    
      I think it was the first time in my life that ever any religious thought
      affected me; but I could not refrain some reflections, and almost tears,
      in considering how happy it was that I was not born among such creatures
      as these, and was not so stupidly ignorant and barbarous; but this soon
      went off again, and I was not troubled again with any qualms of that sort
      for a long time after.
    
    
      When this ceremony was over, our concern was to get some provisions, as
      well for the present subsistence of our prisoners as ourselves; and making
      signs to our prince that we were thinking upon that subject, he made signs
      to me that, if I would let one of the prisoners go to his town, he should
      bring provisions, and should bring some beasts to carry our baggage. I
      seemed loth to trust him, and supposing that he would run away, he made
      great signs of fidelity, and with his own hands tied a rope about his
      neck, offering me one end of it, intimating that I should hang him if the
      man did not come again. So I consented, and he gave him abundance of
      instructions, and sent him away, pointing to the light of the sun, which
      it seems was to tell him at what time he must be back.
    
    
      The fellow ran as if he was mad, and held it till he was quite out of
      sight, by which I supposed he had a great way to go. The next morning,
      about two hours before the time appointed, the black prince, for so I
      always called him, beckoning with his hand to me, and hallooing after his
      manner, desired me to come to him, which I did, when, pointing to a little
      hill about two miles off, I saw plainly a little drove of cattle, and
      several people with them; those, he told me by signs, were the man he had
      sent, and several more with him, and cattle for us.
    
    
      Accordingly, by the time appointed, he came quite to our huts, and brought
      with him a great many cows, young runts, about sixteen goats, and four
      young bulls, taught to carry burthens.
    
    
      This was a supply of provisions sufficient; as for bread, we were obliged
      to shift with some roots which we had made use of before. We then began to
      consider of making some large bags like the soldiers' knapsacks, for their
      men to carry our baggage in, and to make it easy to them; and the goats
      being killed, I ordered the skins to be spread in the sun, and they were
      as dry in two days as could be desired; so we found means to make such
      little bags as we wanted, and began to divide our baggage into them. When
      the black prince found what they were for, and how easy they were of
      carriage when we put them on, he smiled a little, and sent away the man
      again to fetch skins, and he brought two natives more with him, all loaded
      with skins better cured than ours, and of other kinds, such as we could
      not tell what names to give them.
    
    
      These two men brought the black prince two lances, of the sort they use in
      their fights, but finer than ordinary, being made of black smooth wood, as
      fine as ebony, and headed at the point with the end of a long tooth of
      some creature       we could not tell of what creature; the head was so
      firm put on, and the tooth so strong, though no bigger than my thumb, and
      sharp at the end, that I never saw anything like it in any place in the
      world.
    
    
      The prince would not take them till I gave him leave, but made signs that
      they should give them to me; however, I gave him leave to take them
      himself, for I saw evident signs of an honourable just principle in him.
    
    
      We now prepared for our march, when the prince coming to me, and pointing
      towards the several quarters of the world, made signs to know which way we
      intended to go; and when I showed him, pointing to the west, he presently
      let me know there was a great river a little further to the north, which
      was able to carry our bark many leagues into the country due west. I
      presently took the hint, and inquired for the mouth of the river, which I
      understood by him was above a day's march, and, by our estimation, we
      found it about seven leagues further. I take this to be the great river
      marked by our chart-makers at the northmost part of the coast of
      Mozambique, and called there Quilloa.
    
    
      Consulting thus with ourselves, we resolved to take the prince, and as
      many of the prisoners as we could stow in our frigate, and go about by the
      bay into the river; and that eight of us, with our arms, should march by
      land to meet them on the river side; for the prince, carrying us to a
      rising ground, had showed us the river very plain, a great way up the
      country, and in one place it was not above six miles to it.
    
    
      It was my lot to march by land, and be captain of the whole caravan. I had
      eight of our men with me, and seven-and-thirty of our prisoners, without
      any baggage, for all our luggage was yet on board. We drove the young
      bulls with us; nothing was ever so tame, so willing to work, or carry
      anything. The negroes would ride upon them four at a time, and they would
      go very willingly. They would eat out of our hand, lick our feet, and were
      as tractable as a dog.
    
    
      We drove with us six or seven cows for food; but our negroes knew nothing
      of curing the flesh by salting and drying it till we showed them the way,
      and then they were mighty willing to do so as long as we had any salt to
      do it with, and to carry salt a great way too, after we found we should
      have no more.
    
    
      It was an easy march to the river side for us that went by land, and we
      came thither in a piece of a day, being, as above, no more than six
      English miles; whereas it was no less than five days before they came to
      us by water, the wind in the bay having failed them, and the way, by
      reason of a great turn or reach in the river, being about fifty miles
      about.
    
    
      We spent this time in a thing which the two strangers, which brought the
      prince the two lances, put into the head of the prisoners, viz., to make
      bottles of the goats' skins to carry fresh water in, which it seems they
      knew we should come to want; and the men did it so dexterously, having
      dried skins fetched them by those two men, that before our vessel came up,
      they had every man a pouch like a bladder, to carry fresh water in,
      hanging over their shoulders by a thong made of other skins, about three
      inches broad, like the sling of a fuzee.
    
    
      Our prince, to assure us of the fidelity of the men in this march, had
      ordered them to be tied two and two by the wrist, as we handcuff prisoners
      in England; and made them so sensible of the reasonableness of it, that he
      made them do it themselves, appointing four of them to bind the rest; but
      we found them so honest, and particularly so obedient to him, that after
      we were gotten a little further off of their own country, we set them at
      liberty, though, when he came to us, he would have them tied again, and
      they continued so a good while.
    
    
      All the country on the bank of the river was a high land, no marshy swampy
      ground in it; the verdure good, and abundance of cattle feeding upon it
      wherever we went, or which way soever we looked; there was not much wood
      indeed, at least not near us; but further up we saw oak, cedar, and
      pine-trees, some of which were very large.
    
    
      The river was a fair open channel, about as broad as the Thames below
      Gravesend, and a strong tide of flood, which we found held us about sixty
      miles; the channel deep, nor did we find any want of water for a great
      way. In short, we went merrily up the river with the flood and the wind
      blowing still fresh at E. and E.N.E. We stemmed the ebb easily also,
      especially while the river continued broad and deep; but when we came past
      the swelling of the tide, and had the natural current of the river to go
      against, we found it too strong for us, and began to think of quitting our
      bark; but the prince would by no means agree to that, for, finding we had
      on board pretty good store of roping made of mats and flags, which I
      described before, he ordered all the prisoners which were on shore to come
      and take hold of those ropes, and tow us along by the shore side; and as
      we hoisted our sail too, to ease them, the men ran along with us at a very
      great rate.
    
    
      In this manner the river carried us up, by our computation, near 200
      miles, and then it narrowed apace, and was not above as broad as the
      Thames is at Windsor, or thereabouts; and, after another day, we came to a
      great waterfall or cataract, enough to fright us, for I believe the whole
      body of water fell at once perpendicularly down a precipice above sixty
      foot high, which made noise enough to deprive men of their hearing, and we
      heard it above ten miles before we came to it.
    
    
      Here we were at a full stop, and now our prisoners went first on shore;
      they had worked very hard and very cheerfully, relieving one another,
      those that were weary being taken into the bark. Had we had canoes or any
      boats which might have been carried by men's strength we might have gone
      two hundred miles more up this river in small boats, but our great boat
      could go no farther.
    
    
      All this way the country looked green and pleasant, and was full of
      cattle, and some people we saw, though not many; but this we observed now,
      that the people did no more understand our prisoners here than we could
      understand them; being, it seems, of different nations and of different
      speech. We had yet seen no wild beasts, or, at least, none that came very
      near us, except two days before we came to the waterfall, when we saw
      three of the most beautiful leopards that ever were seen, standing upon
      the bank of the river on the north side, our prisoners being all on the
      other side of the water. Our gunner espied them first, and ran to fetch
      his gun, putting a ball extraordinary in it; and coming to me, "Now,
      Captain Bob," says he, "where is your prince?" So I called him out. "Now,"
      says he, "tell your men not to be afraid; tell them they shall see that
      thing in his hand speak in fire to one of those beasts, and make it kill
      itself."
    
    
      The poor negroes looked as if they had been all going to be killed,
      notwithstanding what their prince said to them, and stood staring to
      expect the issue, when on a sudden the gunner fired; and as he was a very
      good marksman, he shot the creature with two slugs, just in the head. As
      soon as the leopard felt herself struck, she reared up on her two
      hind-legs, bolt upright, and throwing her forepaws about in the air, fell
      backward, growling and struggling, and immediately died; the other two,
      frighted with the fire and the noise, fled, and were out of sight in an
      instant.
    
    
      But the two frighted leopards were not in half the consternation that our
      prisoners were; four or five of them fell down as if they had been shot;
      several others fell on their knees, and lifted up their hands to us;
      whether to worship us, or pray us not to kill them, we did not know; but
      we made signs to their prince to encourage them, which he did, but it was
      with much ado that he brought them to their senses. Nay, the prince,
      notwithstanding all that was said to prepare him for it, yet when the
      piece went off, he gave a start as if he would have leaped into the river.
    
    
      When we saw the creature killed, I had a great mind to have the skin of
      her, and made signs to the prince that he should send some of his men over
      to take the skin off. As soon as he spoke but a word, four of them, that
      offered themselves, were untied, and immediately they jumped into the
      river, and swam over, and went to work with him. The prince having a knife
      that we gave him, made four wooden knives so clever, that I never saw
      anything like them in my life; and in less than an hour's time they
      brought me the skin of the leopard, which was a monstrous great one, for
      it was from the ears to the tale about seven foot, and near five foot
      broad on the back, and most admirably spotted all over. The skin of this
      leopard I brought to London many years after.
    
    
      We were now all upon a level as to our travelling, being unshipped, for
      our bark would swim no farther, and she was too heavy to carry on our
      backs; but as we found the course of the river went a great way farther,
      we consulted our carpenters whether we could not pull the bark in pieces,
      and make us three or four small boats to go on with. They told us we might
      do so, but it would be very long a-doing; and that, when we had done, we
      had neither pitch or tar to make them sound to keep the water out, or
      nails to fasten the plank. But one of them told us that as soon as he
      could come at any large tree near the river, he would make us a canoe or
      two in a quarter of the time, and which would serve us as well for all the
      uses we could have any occasion for as a boat; and such, that if we came
      to any waterfalls, we might take them up, and carry them for a mile or two
      by land upon our shoulders.
    
    
      Upon this we gave over the thoughts of our frigate, and hauling her into a
      little cove or inlet, where a small brook came into the main river, we
      laid her up for those that came next, and marched forward. We spent indeed
      two days dividing our baggage, and loading our tame buffaloes and our
      negroes. Our powder and shot, which was the thing we were most careful of,
      we ordered thus:       First, the powder we divided into little leather
      bags, that is to say, bags of dried skins, with the hair inward, that the
      powder might not grow damp; and then we put those bags into other bags,
      made of bullocks' skins, very thick and hard, with the hair outward, that
      no wet might come in; and this succeeded so well, that in the greatest
      rains we had, whereof some were very violent and very long, we always kept
      our powder dry. Besides these bags, which held our chief magazine, we
      divided to every one a quarter of a pound of powder, and half a pound of
      shot, to carry always about us; which, as it was enough for our present
      use, so we were willing to have no weight to carry more than was
      absolutely necessary, because of the heat.
    
    
      We kept still on the bank of the river, and for that reason had but very
      little communication with the people of the country; for, having also our
      bark stored with plenty of provisions, we had no occasion to look abroad
      for a supply; but now, when we came to march on foot, we were obliged
      often to seek out for food. The first place we came to on the river, that
      gave us any stop, was a little negro town, containing about fifty huts,
      and there appeared about 400 people, for they all came out to see us, and
      wonder at us. When our negroes appeared the inhabitants began to fly to
      arms, thinking there had been enemies coming upon them; but our negroes,
      though they could not speak their language, made signs to them that they
      had no weapons, and were tied two and two together as captives, and that
      there were people behind who came from the sun, and that could kill them
      all, and make them alive again, if they pleased; but that they would do
      them no hurt, and came with peace. As soon as they understood this they
      laid down their lances, and bows and arrows, and came and stuck twelve
      large stakes in the ground as a token of peace, bowing themselves to us in
      token of submission. But as soon as they saw white men with beards, that
      is to say, with mustachios, they ran screaming away, as in a fright.
    
    
      We kept at a distance from them, not to be too familiar; and when we did
      appear it was but two or three of us at a time. But our prisoners made
      them understand that we required some provisions of them; so they brought
      us some black cattle, for they have abundance of cows and buffaloes all
      over that side of the country, as also great numbers of deer. Our cutler,
      who had now a great stock of things of his handiwork, gave them some
      little knick-knacks, as plates of silver and of iron, cut diamond fashion,
      and cut into hearts and into rings, and they were mightily pleased. They
      also brought several fruits and roots, which we did not understand, but
      our negroes fed heartily on them, and after we had seen them eat them, we
      did so too.
    
    
      Having stocked ourselves here with flesh and root as much as we could well
      carry, we divided the burthens among our negroes, appointing about thirty
      to forty pounds weight to a man, which we thought indeed was load enough
      in a hot country; and the negroes did not at all repine at it, but would
      sometimes help one another when they began to be weary, which did happen
      now and then, though not often; besides, as most of their luggage was our
      provision, it lightened every day, like Aesop's basket of bread, till we
      came to get a recruit.       Note, when we loaded them we untied their
      hands, and tied them two and two together by one foot.
    
    
      The third day of our march from this place our chief carpenter desired us
      to halt, and set up some huts, for he had found out some trees that he
      liked, and resolved to make us some canoes; for, as he told me, he knew we
      should have marching enough on foot after we left the river, and he was
      resolved to go no farther by land than needs must.
    
    
      We had no sooner given orders for our little camp, and given leave to our
      negroes to lay down their loads, but they fell to work to build our huts;
      and though they were tied as above, yet they did it so nimbly as surprised
      us. Here we set some of the negroes quite at liberty, that is to say,
      without tying them, having the prince's word passed for their fidelity;
      and some of these were ordered to help the carpenters, which they did very
      handily, with a little direction, and others were sent to see whether they
      could get any provisions near hand; but instead of provisions, three of
      them came in with two bows and arrows, and five lances. They could not
      easily make us understand how they came by them, only that they had
      surprised some negro women, who were in some huts, the men being from
      home, and they had found the lances and bows in the huts, or houses, the
      women and children flying away at the sight of them, as from robbers. We
      seemed very angry at them, and made the prince ask them if they had not
      killed any of the women or children, making them believe that, if they had
      killed anybody, we would make them kill themselves too; but they protested
      their innocence, so we excused them. Then they brought us the bows and
      arrows and lances; but, at a motion of their black prince, we gave them
      back the bows and arrows, and gave them leave to go out to see what they
      could kill for food; and here we gave them the laws of arms, viz., that if
      any man appeared to assault them, or shoot at them to offer any violence
      to them, they might kill them; but that they should not offer to kill or
      hurt any that offered them peace, or laid down their weapons, nor any
      women or children, upon any occasion whatsoever. These were our articles
      of war.
    
    
      These two fellows had not been gone out above three or four hours, but one
      of them came running to us without his bow and arrows, hallooing and
      whooping a great while before he came at us, "Okoamo, okoamo!" which, it
      seems, was, "Help, help!" The rest of the negroes rose up in a hurry, and
      by twos, as they could, ran forward towards their fellows, to know what
      the matter was. As for me, I did not understand it, nor any of our people;
      the prince looked as if something unlucky had fallen out, and some of our
      men took up their arms to be ready on occasion. But the negroes soon
      discovered the thing, for we saw four of them presently after coming along
      with a great load of meat upon their backs. The case was, that the two who
      went out with their bows and arrows, meeting with a great herd of deer in
      the plain, had been so nimble as to shoot three of them, and then one of
      them came running to us for help to fetch them away. This was the first
      venison we had met with in all our march, and we feasted upon it very
      plentifully; and this was the first time we began to prevail with our
      prince to eat his meat dressed our way; after which his men were prevailed
      with by his example, but before that, they ate most of the flesh they had
      quite raw.
    
    
      We wished now we had brought some bows and arrows out with us, which we
      might have done; and we began to have so much confidence in our negroes,
      and to be so familiar with them, that we oftentimes let them go, or the
      greatest part of them, untied, being well assured they would not leave us,
      and that they did not know what course to take without us; but one thing
      we resolved not to trust them with, and that was the charging our guns:
      but they always believed our guns had some heavenly power in them, that
      would send forth fire and smoke, and speak with a dreadful noise, and kill
      at a distance whenever we bid them.
    
    
      In about eight days we finished three canoes, and in them we embarked our
      white men and our baggage, with our prince, and some of the prisoners. We
      also found it needful to keep some of ourselves always on shore, not only
      to manage the negroes, but to defend them from enemies and wild beasts.
      Abundance of little incidents happened upon this march, which it is
      impossible to crowd into this account; particularly, we saw more wild
      beasts now than we did before, some elephants, and two or three lions,
      none of which kinds we had seen any of before; and we found our negroes
      were more afraid of them a great deal than we were; principally, because
      they had no bows and arrows, or lances, which were the particular weapons
      they were bred up to the exercise of.
    
    
      But we cured them of their fears by being always ready with our firearms.
      However, as we were willing to be sparing of our powder, and the killing
      of any of the creatures now was no advantage to us, seeing their skins
      were too heavy for us to carry, and their flesh not good to eat, we
      resolved therefore to keep some of our pieces uncharged and only primed;
      and causing them to flash in the pan, the beasts, even the lions
      themselves, would always start and fly back when they saw it, and
      immediately march off.
    
    
      We passed abundance of inhabitants upon this upper part of the river, and
      with this observation, that almost every ten miles we came to a separate
      nation, and every separate nation had a different speech, or else their
      speech had differing dialects, so that they did not understand one
      another. They all abounded in cattle, especially on the river-side; and
      the eighth day of this second navigation we met with a little negro town,
      where they had growing a sort of corn like rice, which ate very sweet;
      and, as we got some of it of the people, we made very good cakes of bread
      of it, and, making a fire, baked them on the ground, after the fire was
      swept away, very well; so that hitherto we had no want of provisions of
      any kind that we could desire.
    
    
      Our negroes towing our canoes, we travelled at a considerable rate, and by
      our own account could not go less than twenty or twenty-five English miles
      a day, and the river continuing to be much of the same breadth and very
      deep all the way, till on the tenth day we came to another cataract; for a
      ridge of high hills crossing the whole channel of the river, the water
      came tumbling down the rocks from one stage to another in a strange
      manner, so that it was a continued link of cataracts from one to another,
      in the manner of a cascade, only that the falls were sometimes a quarter
      of a mile from one another, and the noise confused and frightful.
    
    
      We thought our voyaging was at a full stop now; but three of us, with a
      couple of our negroes, mounting the hills another way, to view the course
      of the river, we found a fair channel again after about half a mile's
      march, and that it was like to hold us a good way further. So we set all
      hands to work, unloaded our cargo, and hauled our canoes on shore, to see
      if we could carry them.
    
    
      Upon examination we found that they were very heavy; but our carpenters,
      spending but one day's work upon them, hewed away so much of the timber
      from their outsides as reduced them very much, and yet they were as fit to
      swim as before. When this was done, ten men with poles took up one of the
      canoes and made nothing to carry it. So we ordered twenty men to each
      canoe, that one ten might relieve the other; and thus we carried all our
      canoes, and launched them into the water again, and then fetched our
      luggage and loaded it all again into the canoes, and all in an afternoon;
      and the next morning early we moved forward again. When we had towed about
      four days more, our gunner, who was our pilot, began to observe that we
      did not keep our right course so exactly as we ought, the river winding
      away a little towards the north, and gave us notice of it accordingly.
      However, we were not willing to lose the advantage of water-carriage, at
      least not till we were forced to it; so we jogged on, and the river served
      us for about threescore miles further; but then we found it grew very
      small and shallow, having passed the mouths of several little brooks or
      rivulets which came into it; and at length it became but a brook itself.
    
    
      We towed up as far as ever our boats would swim, and we went two days the
      farther       having been about twelve days in this last part of the river       by
      lightening the boats and taking our luggage out, which we made the negroes
      carry, being willing to ease ourselves as long as we could; but at the end
      of these two days, in short, there was not water enough to swim a London
      wherry.
    
    
      We now set forward wholly by land, and without any expectation of more
      water-carriage. All our concern for more water was to be sure to have a
      supply for our drinking; and therefore upon every hill that we came near
      we clambered up to the highest part to see the country before us, and to
      make the best judgment we could which way to go to keep the lowest
      grounds, and as near some stream of water as we could.
    
    
      The country held verdant, well grown with trees, and spread with rivers
      and brooks, and tolerably well with inhabitants, for about thirty days'
      march after our leaving the canoes, during which time things went pretty
      well with us; we did not tie ourselves down when to march and when to
      halt, but ordered those things as our convenience and the health and ease
      of our people, as well our servants as ourselves, required.
    
    
      About the middle of this march we came into a low and plain country, in
      which we perceived a greater number of inhabitants than in any other
      country we had gone through; but that which was worse for us, we found
      them a fierce, barbarous, treacherous people, and who at first looked upon
      us as robbers, and gathered themselves in numbers to attack us.
    
    
      Our men were terrified at them at first, and began to discover an unusual
      fear, and even our black prince seemed in a great deal of confusion; but I
      smiled at him, and showing him some of our guns, I asked him if he thought
      that which killed the spotted cat (for so they called the leopard in their
      language) could not make a thousand of those naked creatures die at one
      blow? Then he laughed, and said, yes, he believed it would. "Well, then,"
      said I, "tell your men not to be afraid of these people, for we shall soon
      give them a taste of what we can do if they pretend to meddle with us."
      However, we considered we were in the middle of a vast country, and we
      knew not what numbers of people and nations we might be surrounded with,
      and, above all, we knew not how much we might stand in need of the
      friendship of these that we were now among, so that we ordered the negroes
      to try all the methods they could to make them friends.
    
    
      Accordingly the two men who had gotten bows and arrows, and two more to
      whom we gave the prince's two fine lances, went foremost, with five more,
      having long poles in their hands; and after them ten of our men advanced
      toward the negro town that was next to us, and we all stood ready to
      succour them if there should be occasion.
    
    
      When they came pretty near their houses our negroes hallooed in their
      screaming way, and called to them as loud as they could. Upon their
      calling, some of the men came out and answered, and immediately after the
      whole town, men, women, and children, appeared; our negroes, with their
      long poles, went forward a little, and stuck them all in the ground, and
      left them, which in their country was a signal of peace, but the other did
      not understand the meaning of that. Then the two men with bows laid down
      their bows and arrows, went forward unarmed, and made signs of peace to
      them, which at last the other began to understand; so two of their men
      laid down their bows and arrows, and came towards them. Our men made all
      the signs of friendship to them that they could think of, putting their
      hands up to their mouths as a sign that they wanted provisions to eat; and
      the other pretended to be pleased and friendly, and went back to their
      fellows and talked with them a while, and they came forward again, and
      made signs that they would bring some provisions to them before the sun
      set; and so our men came back again very well satisfied for that time.
    
    
      But an hour before sunset our men went to them again, just in the same
      posture as before, and they came according to their appointment, and
      brought deer's flesh, roots, and the same kind of corn, like rice, which I
      mentioned above; and our negroes, being furnished with such toys as our
      cutler had contrived, gave them some of them, which they seemed infinitely
      pleased with, and promised to bring more provisions the next day.
    
    
      Accordingly the next day they came again, but our men perceived they were
      more in number by a great many than before. However, having sent out ten
      men with firearms to stand ready, and our whole army being in view also,
      we were not much surprised; nor was the treachery of the enemy so
      cunningly ordered as in other cases, for they might have surrounded our
      negroes, which were but nine, under a show of peace; but when they saw our
      men advance almost as far as the place where they were the day before, the
      rogues snatched up their bows and arrows and came running upon our men
      like so many furies, at which our ten men called to the negroes to come
      back to them, which they did with speed enough at the first word, and
      stood all behind our men. As they fled, the other advanced, and let fly
      near a hundred of their arrows at them, by which two of our negroes were
      wounded, and one we thought had been killed. When they came to the five
      poles that our men had stuck in the ground, they stood still awhile, and
      gathering about the poles, looked at them, and handled them, as wondering
      what they meant. We then, who were drawn up behind all, sent one of our
      number to our ten men to bid them fire among them while they stood so
      thick, and to put some small shot into their guns besides the ordinary
      charge, and to tell them that we would be up with them immediately.
    
    
      Accordingly they made ready; but by the time they were ready to fire, the
      black army had left their wandering about the poles, and began to stir as
      if they would come on, though seeing more men stand at some distance
      behind our negroes, they could not tell what to make of us; but if they
      did not understand us before, they understood us less afterwards, for as
      soon as ever our men found them to begin to move forward they fired among
      the thickest of them, being about the distance of 120 yards, as near as we
      could guess.
    
    
      It is impossible to express the fright, the screaming and yelling of those
      wretches upon this first volley. We killed six of them, and wounded eleven
      or twelve, I mean as we knew of; for, as they stood thick, and the small
      shot, as we called it, scattered among them, we had reason to believe we
      wounded more that stood farther off, for our small shot was made of bits
      of lead and bits of iron, heads of nails, and such things as our diligent
      artificer, the cutler, helped us to.
    
    
      As to those that were killed and wounded, the other frighted creatures
      were under the greatest amazement in the world, to think what should hurt
      them, for they could see nothing but holes made in their bodies they knew
      not how. Then the fire and noise amazed all their women and children, and
      frighted them out of their wits, so that they ran staring and howling
      about like mad creatures.
    
    
      However, all this did not make them fly, which was what we wanted, nor did
      we find any of them die as it were with fear, as at first; so we resolved
      upon a second volley, and then to advance as we did before. Whereupon our
      reserved men advancing, we resolved to fire only three men at a time, and
      move forward like an army firing in platoon; so, being all in a line, we
      fired, first three on the right, then three on the left, and so on; and
      every time we killed or wounded some of them, but still they did not fly,
      and yet they were so frighted that they used none of their bows and
      arrows, or of their lances; and we thought their numbers increased upon
      our hands, particularly we thought so by the noise. So I called to our men
      to halt, and bid them pour in one whole volley and then shout, as we did
      in our first fight, and so run in upon them and knock them down with our
      muskets.
    
    
      But they were too wise for that too, for as soon as we had fired a whole
      volley and shouted, they all ran away, men, women, and children, so fast
      that in a few moments we could not see one creature of them except some
      that were wounded and lame, who lay wallowing and screaming here and there
      upon the ground as they happened to fall.
    
    
      Upon this we came up to the field of battle, where we found we had killed
      thirty-seven of them, among which were three women, and had wounded about
      sixty-four, among which were two women; by wounded I mean such as were so
      maimed as not to be able to go away, and those our negroes killed
      afterwards in a cowardly manner in cold blood, for which we were very
      angry, and threatened to make them go to them if they did so again.
    
    
      There was no great spoil to be got, for they were all stark naked as they
      came into the world, men and women together, some of them having feathers
      stuck in their hair, and others a kind of bracelet about their necks, but
      nothing else; but our negroes got a booty here, which we were very glad
      of, and this was the bows and arrows of the vanquished, of which they
      found more than they knew what to do with, belonging to the killed and
      wounded men; these we ordered them to pick up, and they were very useful
      to us afterwards. After the fight, and our negroes had gotten bows and
      arrows, we sent them out in parties to see what they could get, and they
      got some provisions; but, which was better than all the rest, they brought
      us four more young bulls, or buffaloes, that had been brought up to labour
      and to carry burthens. They knew them, it seems, by the burthens they had
      carried having galled their backs, for they have no saddles to cover them
      with in that country.
    
    
      Those creatures not only eased our negroes, but gave us an opportunity to
      carry more provisions; and our negroes loaded them very hard at this place
      with flesh and roots, such as we wanted very much afterwards.
    
    
      In this town we found a very little young leopard, about two spans high;
      it was exceeding tame, and purred like a cat when we stroked it with our
      hands, being, as I suppose, bred up among the negroes like a house-dog. It
      was our black prince, it seems, who, making his tour among the abandoned
      houses or huts, found this creature there, and making much of him, and
      giving a bit or two of flesh to him, the creature followed him like a dog;
      of which more hereafter.
    
    
      Among the negroes that were killed in this battle there was one who had a
      little thin bit or plate of gold, about as big as a sixpence, which hung
      by a little bit of a twisted gut upon his forehead, by which we supposed
      he was a man of some eminence among them; but that was not all, for this
      bit of gold put us upon searching very narrowly if there was not more of
      it to be had thereabouts, but we found none at all.
    
    
      From this part of the country we went on for about fifteen days, and then
      found ourselves obliged to march up a high ridge of mountains, frightful
      to behold, and the first of the kind that we met with; and having no guide
      but our little pocket-compass, we had no advantage of information as to
      which was the best or the worst way, but was obliged to choose by what we
      saw, and shift as well as we could. We met with several nations of wild
      and naked people in the plain country before we came to those hills, and
      we found them much more tractable and friendly than those devils we had
      been forced to fight with; and though we could learn little from these
      people, yet we understood by the signs they made that there was a vast
      desert beyond these hills, and, as our negroes called them, much lion,
      much spotted cat (so they called the leopard); and they signed to us also
      that we must carry water with us. At the last of these nations we
      furnished ourselves with as much provisions as we could possibly carry,
      not knowing what we had to suffer, or what length we had to go; and, to
      make our way as familiar to us as possible, I proposed that of the last
      inhabitants we could find we should make some prisoners and carry them
      with us for guides over the desert, and to assist us in carrying
      provision, and, perhaps, in getting it too. The advice was too necessary
      to be slighted; so finding, by our dumb signs to the inhabitants, that
      there were some people that dwelt at the foot of the mountains on the
      other side before we came to the desert itself, we resolved to furnish
      ourselves with guides by fair means or foul.
    
    
      Here, by a moderate computation, we concluded ourselves 700 miles from the
      sea-coast where we began. Our black prince was this day set free from the
      sling his arm hung in, our surgeon having perfectly restored it, and he
      showed it to his own countrymen quite well, which made them greatly
      wonder. Also our two negroes began to recover, and their wounds to heal
      apace, for our surgeon was very skilful in managing their cure.
    
    
      Having with infinite labour mounted these hills, and coming to a view of
      the country beyond them, it was indeed enough to astonish as stout a heart
      as ever was created. It was a vast howling wilderness       not a tree, a
      river, or a green thing to be seen; for, as far as the eye could look,
      nothing but a scalding sand, which, as the wind blew, drove about in
      clouds enough to overwhelm man and beast. Nor could we see any end of it
      either before us, which was our way, or to the right hand or left; so that
      truly our men began to be discouraged, and talk of going back again. Nor
      could we indeed think of venturing over such a horrid place as that before
      us, in which we saw nothing but present death.
    
    
      I was as much affected at the sight as any of them; but, for all that, I
      could not bear the thoughts of going back again. I told them we had
      marched 700 miles of our way, and it would be worse than death to think of
      going back again; and that, if they thought the desert was not passable, I
      thought we should rather change our course, and travel south till we came
      to the Cape of Good Hope, or north to the country that lay along the Nile,
      where, perhaps, we might find some way or other over to the west sea; for
      sure all Africa was not a desert.
    
    
      Our gunner, who, as I said before, was our guide as to the situation of
      places, told us that he could not tell what to say to going for the Cape,
      for it was a monstrous length, being from the place where we now were not
      less than 1500 miles; and, by his account, we were now come a third part
      of the way to the coast of Angola, where we should meet the western ocean,
      and find ways enough for our escape home. On the other hand, he assured
      us, and showed us a map of it, that, if we went northward, the western
      shore of Africa went out into the sea above 1000 miles west, so that we
      should have so much and more land to travel afterwards; which land might,
      for aught we knew, be as wild, barren, and desert as this. And therefore,
      upon the whole, he proposed that we should attempt this desert, and
      perhaps we should not find it so long as we feared; and however, he
      proposed that we should see how far our provisions would carry us, and, in
      particular, our water; and we should venture no further than half so far
      as our water would last; and if we found no end of the desert, we might
      come safely back again.
    
    
      This advice was so reasonable that we all approved of it; and accordingly
      we calculated that we were able to carry provisions for forty-two days,
      but that we could not carry water for above twenty days, though we were to
      suppose it to stink, too, before that time expired. So that we concluded
      that, if we did not come at some water in ten days' time, we would return;
      but if we found a supply of water, we could then travel twenty-one days;
      and, if we saw no end of the wilderness in that time, we would return
      also.
    
    
      With this regulation of our measures, we descended the mountains, and it
      was the second day before we quite reached the plain; where, however, to
      make us amends, we found a fine little rivulet of very good water,
      abundance of deer, a sort of creature like a hare, but not so nimble, but
      whose flesh we found very agreeable. But we were deceived in our
      intelligence, for we found no people; so we got no more prisoners to
      assist us in carrying our baggage.
    
    
      The infinite number of deer and other creatures which we saw here, we
      found was occasioned by the neighbourhood of the waste or desert, from
      whence they retired hither for food and refreshment. We stored ourselves
      here with flesh and roots of divers kinds, which our negroes understood
      better than we, and which served us for bread; and with as much water as
      (by the allowance of a quart a day to a man for our negroes, and three
      pints a day a man for ourselves, and three quarts a day each for our
      buffaloes) would serve us twenty days; and thus loaded for a long
      miserable march, we set forwards, being all sound in health and very
      cheerful, but not alike strong for so great a fatigue; and, which was our
      grievance, were without a guide.
    
    
      In the very first entrance of the waste we were exceedingly discouraged,
      for we found the sand so deep, and it scalded our feet so much with the
      heat, that after we had, as I may call it, waded rather than walked
      through it about seven or eight miles, we were all heartily tired and
      faint; even the very negroes laid down and panted like creatures that had
      been pushed beyond their strength.
    
    
      Here we found the difference of lodging greatly injurious to us; for, as
      before, we always made us huts to sleep under, which covered us from the
      night air, which is particularly unwholesome in those hot countries. But
      we had here no shelter, no lodging, after so hard a march; for here were
      no trees, no, not a shrub near us; and, which was still more frightful,
      towards night we began to hear the wolves howl, the lions bellow, and a
      great many wild asses braying, and other ugly noises which we did not
      understand.
    
    
      Upon this we reflected upon our indiscretion, that we had not, at least,
      brought poles or stakes in our hands, with which we might have, as it
      were, palisadoed ourselves in for the night, and so we might have slept
      secure, whatever other inconveniences we suffered. However, we found a way
      at last to relieve ourselves a little; for first we set up the lances and
      bows we had, and endeavoured to bring the tops of them as near to one
      another as we could, and so hung our coats on the top of them, which made
      us a kind of sorry tent. The leopard's skin, and a few other skins we had
      put together, made us a tolerable covering, and thus we laid down to
      sleep, and slept very heartily too, for the first night; setting, however,
      a good watch, being two of our own men with their fuzes, whom we relieved
      in an hour at first, and two hours afterwards. And it was very well we did
      this, for they found the wilderness swarmed with raging creatures of all
      kinds, some of which came directly up to the very enclosure of our tent.
      But our sentinels were ordered not to alarm us with firing in the night,
      but to flash in the pan at them, which they did, and found it effectual,
      for the creatures went off always as soon as they saw it, perhaps with
      some noise or howling, and pursued such other game as they were upon.
    
    
      If we were tired with the day's travel, we were all as much tired with the
      night's lodging. But our black prince told us in the morning he would give
      us some counsel, and indeed it was very good counsel. He told us we should
      be all killed if we went on this journey, and through this desert, without
      some covering for us at night; so he advised us to march back again to a
      little river-side where we lay the night before, and stay there till we
      could make us houses, as he called them, to carry with us to lodge in
      every night. As he began a little to understand our speech, and we very
      well to understand his signs, we easily knew what he meant, and that we
      should there make mats (for we remembered that we saw a great deal of
      matting or bass there, that the natives make mats of)       I say, that we
      should make large mats there for covering our huts or tents to lodge in at
      night.
    
    
      We all approved this advice, and immediately resolved to go back that one
      day's journey, resolving, though we carried less provisions, we would
      carry mats with us to cover us in the night. Some of the nimblest of us
      got back to the river with more ease than we had travelled it the day
      before; but, as we were not in haste, the rest made a halt, encamped
      another night, and came to us the next day.
    
    
      In our return of this day's journey, our men that made two days of it met
      with a very surprising thing, that gave them some reason to be careful how
      they parted company again. The case was this:       The second day in the
      morning, before they had gone half a mile, looking behind them they saw a
      vast cloud of sand or dust rise in the air, as we see sometimes in the
      roads in summer when it is very dusty and a large drove of cattle are
      coming, only very much greater; and they could easily perceive that it
      came after them; and it came on faster as they went from it. The cloud of
      sand was so great that they could not see what it was that raised it, and
      concluded that it was some army of enemies that pursued them; but then
      considering that they came from the vast uninhabited wilderness, they knew
      it was impossible any nation or people that way should have intelligence
      of them or the way of their march; and therefore, if it was an army, it
      must be of such as they were, travelling that way by accident. On the
      other hand, as they knew that there were no horses in the country, and
      that they came on so fast, they concluded that it must be some vast
      collection of wild beasts, perhaps making to the hill country for food or
      water, and that they should be all devoured or trampled under foot by
      their multitude.
    
    
      Upon this thought, they very prudently observed which way the cloud seemed
      to point, and they turned a little out of their way to the north,
      supposing it might pass by them. When they were about a quarter of a mile,
      they halted to see what it might be. One of the negroes, a nimbler fellow
      than the rest, went back a little, and came in a few minutes running as
      fast as the heavy sands would allow, and by signs gave them to know that
      it was a great herd, or drove, or whatever it might be called, of vast
      monstrous elephants.
    
    
      As it was a sight our men had never seen, they were desirous to see it,
      and yet a little uneasy at the danger too; for though an elephant is a
      heavy unwieldy creature, yet in the deep sand, which is nothing at all to
      them, they marched at a great rate, and would soon have tired our people,
      if they had had far to go, and had been pursued by them.
    
    
      Our gunner was with them, and had a great mind to have gone close up to
      one of the outermost of them, and to have clapped his piece to his ear,
      and to have fired into him, because he had been told no shot would
      penetrate them; but they all dissuaded him, lest upon the noise they
      should all turn upon and pursue us; so he was reasoned out of it, and let
      them pass, which, in our people's circumstances, was certainly the right
      way.
    
    
      They were between twenty and thirty in number, but prodigious great ones;
      and though they often showed our men that they saw them, yet they did not
      turn out of their way, or take any other notice of them than, as we might
      say, just to look at them. We that were before saw the cloud of dust they
      raised, but we had thought it had been our own caravan, and so took no
      notice; but as they bent their course one point of the compass, or
      thereabouts, to the southward of the east, and we went due east [? west],
      they passed by us at some little distance; so that we did not see them, or
      know anything of them, till evening, when our men came to us and gave us
      this account of them. However, this was a useful experiment for our future
      conduct in passing the desert, as you shall hear in its place.
    
    
      We were now upon our work, and our black prince was head surveyor, for he
      was an excellent mat-maker himself, and all his men understood it, so that
      they soon made us near a hundred mats; and as every man, I mean of the
      negroes, carried one, it was no manner of load, and we did not carry an
      ounce of provisions the less. The greatest burthen was to carry six long
      poles, besides some shorter stakes; but the negroes made an advantage of
      that, for carrying them between two, they made the luggage of provisions
      which they had to carry so much the lighter, binding it upon two poles,
      and so made three couple of them. As soon as we saw this, we made a little
      advantage of it too; for having three or four bags, called bottles (I mean
      skins to carry water), more than the men could carry, we got them filled,
      and carried them this way, which was a day's water and more, for our
      journey.
    
    
      Having now ended our work, made our mats, and fully recruited our stores
      of all things necessary, and having made us abundance of small ropes of
      matting for ordinary use, as we might have occasion, we set forward again,
      having interrupted our journey eight days in all, upon this affair. To our
      great comfort, the night before we set out there fell a very violent
      shower of rain, the effects of which we found in the sand; though the heat
      of one day dried the surface as much as before, yet it was harder at
      bottom, not so heavy, and was cooler to our feet, by which means we
      marched, as we reckoned, about fourteen miles instead of seven, and with
      much more ease.
    
    
      When we came to encamp, we had all things ready, for we had fitted our
      tent, and set it up for trial, where we made it; so that, in less than an
      hour, we had a large tent raised, with an inner and outer apartment, and
      two entrances. In one we lay ourselves, in the other our negroes, having
      light pleasant mats over us, and others at the same time under us. Also we
      had a little place without all for our buffaloes, for they deserved our
      care, being very useful to us, besides carrying forage and water for
      themselves. Their forage was a root, which our black prince directed us to
      find, not much unlike a parsnip, very moist and nourishing, of which there
      was plenty wherever we came, this horrid desert excepted.
    
    
      When we came the next morning to decamp, our negroes took down the tent,
      and pulled up the stakes; and all was in motion in as little time as it
      was set up. In this posture we marched eight days, and yet could see no
      end, no change of our prospect, but all looking as wild and dismal as at
      the beginning. If there was any alteration, it was that the sand was
      nowhere so deep and heavy as it was the first three days. This we thought
      might be because, for six months of the year the winds blowing west (as
      for the other six they blow constantly east), the sand was driven
      violently to the side of the desert where we set out, where the mountains
      lying very high, the easterly monsoons, when they blew, had not the same
      power to drive it back again; and this was confirmed by our finding the
      like depth of sand on the farthest extent of the desert to the west.
    
    
      It was the ninth day of our travel in this wilderness, when we came to the
      view of a great lake of water; and you may be sure this was a particular
      satisfaction to us, because we had not water left for above two or three
      days more, at our shortest allowance; I mean allowing water for our
      return, if we had been driven to the necessity of it. Our water had served
      us two days longer than expected, our buffaloes having found, for two or
      three days, a kind of herb like a broad flat thistle, though without any
      prickle, spreading on the ground, and growing in the sand, which they ate
      freely of, and which supplied them for drink as well as forage.
    
    
      The next day, which was the tenth from our setting out, we came to the
      edge of this lake, and, very happily for us, we came to it at the south
      point of it, for to the north we could see no end of it; so we passed by
      it and travelled three days by the side of it, which was a great comfort
      to us, because it lightened our burthen, there being no need to carry
      water when we had it in view. And yet, though here was so much water, we
      found but very little alteration in the desert; no trees, no grass or
      herbage, except that thistle, as I called it, and two or three more
      plants, which we did not understand, of which the desert began to be
      pretty full.
    
    
      But as we were refreshed with the neighbourhood of this lake of water, so
      we were now gotten among a prodigious number of ravenous inhabitants, the
      like whereof, it is most certain, the eye of man never saw; for as I
      firmly believe that never man nor body of men passed this desert since the
      flood, so I believe there is not the like collection of fierce, ravenous,
      and devouring creatures in the world; I mean not in any particular place.
    
    
      For a day's journey before we came to this lake, and all the three days we
      were passing by it, and for six or seven days' march after it, the ground
      was scattered with elephants' teeth in such a number as is incredible; and
      as some of them have lain there for some hundreds of years, so, seeing the
      substance of them scarce ever decays, they may lie there, for aught I
      know, to the end of time. The size of some of them is, it seems, to those
      to whom I have reported it, as incredible as the number; and I can assure
      you there were several so heavy as the strongest man among us could not
      lift. As to number, I question not but there are enough to load a thousand
      sail of the biggest ships in the world, by which I may be understood to
      mean that the quantity is not to be conceived of; seeing that as they
      lasted in view for above eighty miles' travelling, so they might continue
      as far to the right hand, and to the left as far, and many times as far,
      for aught we knew; for it seems the number of elephants hereabouts is
      prodigiously great. In one place in particular we saw the head of an
      elephant, with several teeth in it, but one of the biggest that ever I
      saw; the flesh was consumed, to be sure, many hundred years before, and
      all the other bones; but three of our strongest men could not lift this
      skull and teeth; the great tooth, I believe, weighed at least three
      hundredweight; and this was particularly remarkable to me, that I observed
      the whole skull was as good ivory as the teeth, and, I believe, altogether
      weighed at least six hundredweight; and though I do not know but, by the
      same rule, all the bones of the elephant may be ivory, yet I think there
      is this just objection against it from the example before me, that then
      all the other bones of this elephant would have been there as well as the
      head.
    
    
      I proposed to our gunner, that, seeing we had travelled now fourteen days
      without intermission, and that we had water here for our refreshment, and
      no want of food yet, nor any fear of it, we should rest our people a
      little, and see, at the same time, if perhaps we might kill some creatures
      that were proper for food. The gunner, who had more forecast of that kind
      than I had, agreed to the proposal, and added, why might we not try to
      catch some fish out of the lake? The first thing we had before us was to
      try if we could make any hooks, and this indeed put our artificer to his
      trumps; however, with some labour and difficulty, he did it, and we
      catched fresh fish of several kinds. How they came there, none but He that
      made the lake and all the world knows; for, to be sure, no human hands
      ever put any in there, or pulled any out before.
    
    
      We not only catched enough for our present refreshment, but we dried
      several large fishes, of kinds which I cannot describe, in the sun, by
      which we lengthened out our provision considerably; for the heat of the
      sun dried them so effectually without salt that they were perfectly cured,
      dry, and hard, in one day's time.
    
    
      We rested ourselves here five days; during which time we had abundance of
      pleasant adventures with the wild creatures, too many to relate. One of
      them was very particular, which was a chase between a she-lion, or
      lioness, and a large deer; and though the deer is naturally a very nimble
      creature, and she flew by us like the wind, having, perhaps, about 300
      yards the start of the lion, yet we found the lion, by her strength, and
      the goodness of her lungs, got ground of her. They passed by us within
      about a quarter of a mile, and we had a view of them a great way, when,
      having given them over, we were surprised, about an hour after, to see
      them come thundering back again on the other side of us, and then the lion
      was within thirty or forty yards of her; and both straining to the
      extremity of their speed, when the deer, coming to the lake, plunged into
      the water, and swam for her life, as she had before run for it.
    
    
      The lioness plunged in after her, and swam a little way, but came back
      again; and when she was got upon the land she set up the most hideous roar
      that ever I heard in my life, as if done in the rage of having lost her
      prey.
    
    
      We walked out morning and evening constantly; the middle of the day we
      refreshed ourselves under our tent. But one morning early we saw another
      chase, which more nearly concerned us than the other; for our black
      prince, walking by the side of the lake, was set upon by a vast, great
      crocodile, which came out of the lake upon him; and though he was very
      light of foot, yet it was as much as he could do to get away. He fled
      amain to us, and the truth is, we did not know what to do, for we were
      told no bullet would enter her; and we found it so at first, for though
      three of our men fired at her, yet she did not mind them; but my friend
      the gunner, a venturous fellow, of a bold heart, and great presence of
      mind, went up so near as to thrust the muzzle of his piece into her mouth,
      and fired, but let his piece fall, and ran for it the very moment he had
      fired it. The creature raged a great while, and spent its fury upon the
      gun, making marks upon the very iron with its teeth, but after some time
      fainted and died.
    
    
      Our negroes spread the banks of the lake all this while for game, and at
      length killed us three deer, one of them very large, the other two very
      small. There was water-fowl also in the lake, but we never came near
      enough to them to shoot any; and as for the desert, we saw no fowls
      anywhere in it but at the lake.
    
    
      We likewise killed two or three civet cats; but their flesh is the worst
      of carrion. We saw abundance of elephants at a distance, and observed they
      always go in very good company, that is to say, abundance of them
      together, and always extended in a fair line of battle; and this, they
      say, is the way they defend themselves from their enemies; for if lions or
      tigers, wolves or any creatures, attack them, they being drawn in a line,
      sometimes reaching five or six miles in length, whatever comes in their
      way is sure to be trod under foot, or beaten in pieces with their trunks,
      or lifted up in the air with their trunks; so that if a hundred lions or
      tigers were coming along, if they meet a line of elephants, they will
      always fly back till they see room to pass by the right hand or the left;
      and if they did not, it would be impossible for one of them to escape; for
      the elephant, though a heavy creature, is yet so dexterous and nimble with
      his trunk, that he will not fail to lift up the heaviest lion, or any
      other wild creature, and throw him up in the air quite over his back, and
      then trample him to death with his feet. We saw several lines of battle
      thus; we saw one so long that indeed there was no end of it to be seen,
      and I believe there might be 2000 elephants in row or line. They are not
      beasts of prey, but live upon the herbage of the field, as an ox does; and
      it is said, that though they are so great a creature, yet that a smaller
      quantity of forage supplies one of them than will suffice a horse.
    
    
      The numbers of this kind of creature that are in those parts are
      inconceivable, as may be gathered from the prodigious quantity of teeth
      which, as I said, we saw in this vast desert; and indeed we saw a hundred
      of them to one of any other kind.
    
    
      One evening we were very much surprised. We were most of us laid down on
      our mats to sleep, when our watch came running in among us, being frighted
      with the sudden roaring of some lions just by them, which, it seems, they
      had not seen, the night being dark, till they were just upon them. There
      was, as it proved, an old lion and his whole family, for there was the
      lioness and three young lions, besides the old king, who was a monstrous
      great one. One of the young ones       who were good, large, well-grown
      ones too       leaped up upon one of our negroes, who stood sentinel,
      before he saw him, at which he was heartily frighted, cried out, and ran
      into the tent. Our other man, who had a gun, had not presence of mind at
      first to shoot him, but struck him with the butt-end of his piece, which
      made him whine a little, and then growl at him fearfully; but the fellow
      retired, and, we being all alarmed, three of our men snatched up their
      guns, ran to the tent door, where they saw the great old lion by the fire
      of his eyes, and first fired at him, but, we supposed, missed him, or at
      least did not kill him; for they went all off, but raised a most hideous
      roar, which, as if they had called for help, brought down a prodigious
      number of lions, and other furious creatures, we know not what, about
      them, for we could not see them; but there was a noise, and yelling and
      howling, and all sorts of such wilderness music on every side of us, as if
      all the beasts of the desert were assembled to devour us.
    
    
      We asked our black prince what we should do with them. "Me go," says he,
      "and fright them all." So he snatches up two or three of the worst of our
      mats, and getting one of our men to strike some fire, he hangs the mat up
      at the end of a pole, and set it on fire, and it blazed abroad a good
      while; at which the creatures all moved off, for we heard them roar, and
      make their bellowing noise at a great distance. "Well," says our gunner,
      "if that will do, we need not burn our mats, which are our beds to lay
      under us, and our tilting to cover us. Let me alone," says he. So he comes
      back into our tent, and falls to making some artificial fireworks and the
      like; and he gave our sentinels some to be ready at hand upon occasion,
      and particularly he placed a great piece of wild-fire upon the same pole
      that the mat had been tied to, and set it on fire, and that burnt there so
      long that all the wild creatures left us for that time.
    
    
      However, we began to be weary of such company; and, to be rid of them, we
      set forward again two days sooner than we intended. We found now, that
      though the desert did not end, nor could we see any appearance of it, yet
      that the earth was pretty full of green stuff of one sort or another, so
      that our cattle had no want; and secondly, that there were several little
      rivers which ran into the lake, and so long as the country continued low,
      we found water sufficient, which eased us very much in our carriage, and
      we went on still sixteen days more without yet coming to any appearance of
      better soil. After this we found the country rise a little, and by that we
      perceived that the water would fail us; so, for fear of the worst, we
      filled our bladder-bottles with water. We found the country rising
      gradually thus for three days continually, when, on the sudden, we
      perceived that, though we had mounted up insensibly, yet that we were on
      the top of a very high ridge of hills, though not such as at first.
    
    
      When we came to look down on the other side of the hills, we saw, to the
      great joy of all our hearts, that the desert was at an end; that the
      country was clothed with green, abundance of trees, and a large river; and
      we made no doubt but that we should find people and cattle also; and here,
      by our gunner's account, who kept our computations, we had marched about
      400 miles over this dismal place of horror, having been four-and-thirty
      days a-doing of it, and consequently were come about 1100 miles of our
      journey.
    
    
      We would willingly have descended the hills that night, but it was too
      late. The next morning we saw everything more plain, and rested ourselves
      under the shade of some trees, which were now the most refreshing things
      imaginable to us, who had been scorched above a month without a tree to
      cover us. We found the country here very pleasant, especially considering
      that we came from; and we killed some deer here also, which we found very
      frequent under the cover of the woods. Also we killed a creature like a
      goat, whose flesh was very good to eat, but it was no goat; we found also
      a great number of fowls like partridge, but something smaller, and were
      very tame; so that we lived here very well, but found no people, at least
      none that would be seen, no, not for several days' journey; and to allay
      our joy, we were almost every night disturbed with lions and tigers;
      elephants, indeed, we saw none here.
    
    
      In three days' march we came to a river, which we saw from the hills, and
      which we called the Golden River; and we found it ran northward, which was
      the first stream we had met with that did so. It ran with a very rapid
      current, and our gunner, pulling out his map, assured me that this was
      either the river Nile, or run into the great lake out of which the river
      Nile was said to take its beginning; and he brought out his charts and
      maps, which, by his instruction, I began to understand very well, and told
      me he would convince me of it, and indeed he seemed to make it so plain to
      me that I was of the same opinion.
    
    
      But I did not enter into the gunner's reason for this inquiry, not in the
      least, till he went on with it farther, and stated it thus:       "If this
      is the river Nile, why should not we build some more canoes, and go down
      this stream, rather than expose ourselves to any more deserts and
      scorching sands in quest of the sea, which when we are come to, we shall
      be as much at a loss how to get home as we were at Madagascar?"
    
    
      The argument was good, had there been no objections in the way of a kind
      which none of us were capable of answering; but, upon the whole, it was an
      undertaking of such a nature that every one of us thought it
      impracticable, and that upon several accounts; and our surgeon, who was
      himself a good scholar and a man of reading, though not acquainted with
      the business of sailing, opposed it, and some of his reasons, I remember,
      were such as these:       First, the length of the way, which both he and
      the gunner allowed, by the course of the water, and turnings of the river,
      would be at least 4000 miles. Secondly, the innumerable crocodiles in the
      river, which we should never be able to escape. Thirdly, the dreadful
      deserts in the way; and lastly, the approaching rainy season, in which the
      streams of the Nile would be so furious, and rise so high       spreading
      far and wide over all the plain country       that we should never be able
      to know when we were in the channel of the river and when not, and should
      certainly be cast away, overset, or run aground so often that it would be
      impossible to proceed by a river so excessively dangerous.
    
    
      This last reason he made so plain to us that we began to be sensible of it
      ourselves, so that we agreed to lay that thought aside, and proceed in our
      first course, westwards towards the sea; but, as if we had been loth to
      depart, we continued, by way of refreshing ourselves, to loiter two days
      upon this river, in which time our black prince, who delighted much in
      wandering up and down, came one evening and brought us several little bits
      of something, he knew not what, but he found it felt heavy and looked
      well, and showed it to me as what he thought was some rarity. I took not
      much notice of it to him, but stepping out and calling the gunner to me I
      showed it to him, and told him what I thought, viz., that it was certainly
      gold. He agreed with me in that, and also in what followed, that we would
      take the black prince out with us the next day, and make him show us where
      he found it; that if there was any quantity to be found we would tell our
      company of it, but if there was but little we would keep counsel, and have
      it to ourselves.
    
    
      But we forgot to engage the prince in the secret, who innocently told so
      much to all the rest, as that they guessed what it was, and came to us to
      see. When we found it was public, we were more concerned to prevent their
      suspecting that we had any design to conceal it, and openly telling our
      thoughts of it, we called our artificer, who agreed presently that it was
      gold; so I proposed that we should all go with the prince to the place
      where he found it, and if any quantity was to be had, we would lie here
      some time and see what we could make of it.
    
    
      Accordingly we went every man of us, for no man was willing to be left
      behind in a discovery of such a nature. When we came to the place we found
      it was on the west side of the river, not in the main river, but in
      another small river or stream which came from the west, and ran into the
      other at that place. We fell to raking in the sand, and washing it in our
      hands; and we seldom took up a handful of sand but we washed some little
      round lumps as big as a pin's head, or sometimes as big as a grape stone,
      into our hands; and we found, in two or three hours' time, that every one
      had got some, so we agreed to leave off, and go to dinner.
    
    
      While we were eating, it came into my thoughts that while we worked at
      this rate in a thing of such nicety and consequence, it was ten to one if
      the gold, which was the make-bait of the world, did not, first or last,
      set us together by the ears, to break our good articles and our
      understanding one among another, and perhaps cause us to part companies,
      or worse; I therefore told them that I was indeed the youngest man in the
      company, but as they had always allowed me to give my opinion in things,
      and had sometimes been pleased to follow my advice, so I had something to
      propose now, which I thought would be for all our advantages, and I
      believed they would all like it very well. I told them we were in a
      country where we all knew there was a great deal of gold, and that all the
      world sent ships thither to get it; that we did not indeed know where it
      was, and so we might get a great deal, or a little, we did not know
      whether; but I offered it to them to consider whether it would not be the
      best way for us, and to preserve the good harmony and friendship that had
      been always kept among us, and which was so absolutely necessary to our
      safety, that what we found should be brought together to one common stock,
      and be equally divided at last, rather than to run the hazard of any
      difference which might happen among us from any one's having found more or
      less than another. I told them, that if we were all upon one bottom we
      should all apply ourselves heartily to the work; and, besides that, we
      might then set our negroes all to work for us, and receive equally the
      fruit of their labour and of our own, and being all exactly alike sharers,
      there could be no just cause of quarrel or disgust among us.
    
    
      They all approved the proposal, and every one jointly swore, and gave
      their hands to one another, that they would not conceal the least grain of
      gold from the rest; and consented that if any one or more should be found
      to conceal any, all that he had should be taken from him and divided among
      the rest; and one thing more was added to it by our gunner, from
      considerations equally good and just, that if any one of us, by any play,
      bet, game, or wager, won any money or gold, or the value of any, from
      another, during our whole voyage, till our return quite to Portugal, he
      should be obliged by us all to restore it again on the penalty of being
      disarmed and turned out of the company, and of having no relief from us on
      any account whatever. This was to prevent wagering and playing for money,
      which our men were apt to do by several means and at several games, though
      they had neither cards nor dice.
    
    
      Having made this wholesome agreement, we went cheerfully to work, and
      showed our negroes how to work for us; and working up the stream on both
      sides, and in the bottom of the river, we spent about three weeks' time
      dabbling in the water; by which time, as it lay all in our way, we had
      gone about six miles, and not more; and still the higher we went, the more
      gold we found; till at last, having passed by the side of a hill, we
      perceived on a sudden that the gold stopped, and that there was not a bit
      taken up beyond that place. It presently occurred to my mind, that it must
      then be from the side of that little hill that all the gold we found was
      worked down.
    
    
      Upon this, we went back to the hill, and fell to work with that. We found
      the earth loose, and of a yellowish loamy colour, and in some places a
      white hard kind of stone, which, in describing since to some of our
      artists, they tell me was the spar which is found by ore, and surrounds it
      in the mine. However, if it had been all gold, we had no instrument to
      force it out; so we passed that. But scratching into the loose earth with
      our fingers, we came to a surprising place, where the earth, for the
      quantity of two bushels, I believe, or thereabouts, crumbled down with
      little more than touching it, and apparently showed us that there was a
      great deal of gold in it. We took it all carefully up, and washing it in
      the water, the loamy earth washed away, and left the gold dust free in our
      hands; and that which was more remarkable was, that, when this loose earth
      was all taken away, and we came to the rock or hard stone, there was not
      one grain of gold more to be found.
    
    
      At night we all came together to see what we had got; and it appeared we
      had found, in that day's heap of earth, about fifty pounds' weight of gold
      dust, and about thirty-four pounds' weight more in all the rest of our
      works in the river.
    
    
      It was a happy kind of disappointment to us, that we found a full stop put
      to our work; for, had the quantity of gold been ever so small, yet, had
      any at all come, I do not know when we should have given over; for, having
      rummaged this place, and not finding the least grain of gold in any other
      place, or in any of the earth there, except in that loose parcel, we went
      quite back down the small river again, working it over and over again, as
      long as we could find anything, how small soever; and we did get six or
      seven pounds more the second time. Then we went into the first river, and
      tried it up the stream and down the stream, on the one side and on the
      other. Up the stream we found nothing, no, not a grain; down the stream we
      found very little, not above the quantity of half an ounce in two miles'
      working; so back we came again to the Golden River, as we justly called
      it, and worked it up the stream and down the stream twice more apiece, and
      every time we found some gold, and perhaps might have done so if we had
      stayed there till this time; but the quantity was at last so small, and
      the work so much the harder, that we agreed by consent to give it over,
      lest we should fatigue ourselves and our negroes so as to be quite unfit
      for our journey.
    
    
      When we had brought all our purchase together, we had in the whole three
      pounds and a half of gold to a man, share and share alike, according to
      such a weight and scale as our ingenious cutler made for us to weigh it
      by, which indeed he did by guess, but which, as he said, he was sure was
      rather more than less, and so it proved at last; for it was near two
      ounces more than weight in a pound. Besides this, there was seven or eight
      pounds' weight left, which we agreed to leave in his hands, to work it
      into such shapes as we thought fit, to give away to such people as we
      might yet meet with, from whom we might have occasion to buy provisions,
      or even to buy friendship, or the like; and particularly we gave about a
      pound to our black prince, which he hammered and worked by his own
      indefatigable hand, and some tools our artificer lent him, into little
      round bits, as round almost as beads, though not exact in shape, and
      drilling holes through them, put them all upon a string, and wore them
      about his black neck, and they looked very well there, I assure you; but
      he was many months a-doing it. And thus ended our first golden adventure.
    
    
      We now began to discover what we had not troubled our heads much about
      before, and that was, that, let the country be good or bad that we were
      in, we could not travel much further for a considerable time. We had been
      now five months and upwards in our journey, and the seasons began to
      change; and nature told us, that, being in a climate that had a winter as
      well as a summer, though of a different kind from what our country
      produced, we were to expect a wet season, and such as we should not be
      able to travel in, as well by reason of the rain itself, as of the floods
      which it would occasion wherever we should come; and though we had been no
      strangers to those wet seasons in the island of Madagascar, yet we had not
      thought much of them since we began our travels; for, setting out when the
      sun was about the solstice, that is, when it was at the greatest northern
      distance from us, we had found the benefit of it in our travels. But now
      it drew near us apace, and we found it began to rain; upon which we called
      another general council, in which we debated our present circumstances,
      and, in particular, whether we should go forward, or seek for a proper
      place upon the bank of our Golden River, which had been so lucky to us, to
      fix our camp for the winter.
    
    
      Upon the whole, it was resolved to abide where we were; and it was not the
      least part of our happiness that we did so, as shall appear in its place.
    
    
      Having resolved upon this, our first measures were to set our negroes to
      work, to make huts or houses for our habitation, and this they did very
      dexterously; only that we changed the ground where we at first intended
      it, thinking, as indeed it happened, that the river might reach it upon
      any sudden rain. Our camp was like a little town, in which our huts were
      in the centre, having one large one in the centre of them also, into which
      all our particular lodgings opened; so that none of us went into our
      apartments but through a public tent, where we all ate and drank together,
      and kept our councils and society; and our carpenters made us tables,
      benches, and stools in abundance, as many as we could make use of.
    
    
      We had no need of chimneys, it was hot enough without fire; but yet we
      found ourselves at last obliged to keep a fire every night upon a
      particular occasion. For though we had in all other respects a very
      pleasant and agreeable situation, yet we were rather worse troubled with
      the unwelcome visits of wild beasts here than in the wilderness itself;
      for as the deer and other gentle creatures came hither for shelter and
      food, so the lions and tigers and leopards haunted these places
      continually for prey.
    
    
      When first we discovered this we were so uneasy at it that we thought of
      removing our situation; but after many debates about it we resolved to
      fortify ourselves in such a manner as not to be in any danger from it; and
      this our carpenters undertook, who first palisaded our camp quite round
      with long stakes, for we had wood enough, which stakes were not stuck in
      one by another like pales, but in an irregular manner; a great multitude
      of them so placed that they took up near two yards in thickness, some
      higher, some lower, all sharpened at the top, and about a foot asunder: so
      that had any creature jumped at them, unless he had gone clean over, which
      it was very hard to do, he would be hung upon twenty or thirty spikes.
    
    
      The entrance into this had larger stakes than the rest, so placed before
      one another as to make three or four short turnings which no four-footed
      beast bigger than a dog could possibly come in at; and that we might not
      be attacked by any multitude together, and consequently be alarmed in our
      sleep, as we had been, or be obliged to waste our ammunition, which we
      were very chary of, we kept a great fire every night without the entrance
      of our palisade, having a hut for our two sentinels to stand in free from
      the rain, just within the entrance, and right against the fire.
    
    
      To maintain this fire we cut a prodigious deal of wood, and piled it up in
      a heap to dry, and with the green boughs made a second covering over our
      huts, so high and thick that it might cast the rain from the first, and
      keep us effectually dry.
    
    
      We had scarcely finished all these works but the rain came on so fierce
      and so continued that we had little time to stir abroad for food, except
      indeed that our negroes, who wore no clothes, seemed to make nothing of
      the rain; though to us Europeans, in those hot climates, nothing is more
      dangerous.
    
    
      We continued in this posture for four months, that is to say, from the
      middle of June to the middle of October; for though the rains went off, at
      least the greatest violence of them, about the equinox, yet, as the sun
      was then just over our heads, we resolved to stay awhile till it passed a
      little to the southward.
    
    
      During our encampment here we had several adventures with the ravenous
      creatures of that country; and had not our fire been always kept burning,
      I question much whether all our fence, though we strengthened it
      afterwards with twelve or fourteen rows of stakes or more, would have kept
      us secure. It was always in the night that we had the disturbance of them,
      and sometimes they came in such multitudes that we thought all the lions
      and tigers, and leopards and wolves of Africa were come together to attack
      us. One night, being clear moonshine, one of our men being upon the watch,
      told us that he verily believed he saw ten thousand wild creatures of one
      sort or another pass by our little camp, and ever as they saw the fire
      they sheered off, but were sure to howl or roar, or whatever it was, when
      they were past.
    
    
      The music of their voices was very far from being pleasant to us, and
      sometimes would be so very disturbing that we could not sleep for it; and
      often our sentinels would call us that were awake to come and look at
      them. It was one windy, tempestuous night, after a rainy day, that we were
      indeed called up; for such innumerable numbers of devilish creatures came
      about us that our watch really thought they would attack us. They would
      not come on the side where the fire was; and though we thought ourselves
      secure everywhere else, yet we all got up and took to our arms. The moon
      was near the full, but the air full of flying clouds, and a strange
      hurricane of wind to add to the terror of the night; when, looking on the
      back part of our camp, I thought I saw a creature within our
      fortification, and so indeed he was, except his haunches, for he had taken
      a running leap, I suppose, and with all his might had thrown himself clear
      over our palisades, except one strong pile, which stood higher than the
      rest, and which had caught hold of him, and by his weight he had hanged
      himself upon it, the spike of the pile running into his hinder haunch or
      thigh, on the inside; and by that he hung, growling and biting the wood
      for rage. I snatched up a lance from one of the negroes that stood just by
      me, and running to him, struck it three or four times into him, and
      despatched him, being unwilling to shoot, because I had a mind to have a
      volley fired among the rest, whom I could see standing without, as thick
      as a drove of bullocks going to a fair. I immediately called our people
      out, and showed them the object of terror which I had seen, and, without
      any further consultation, fired a full volley among them, most of our
      pieces being loaded with two or three slugs or bullets apiece. It made a
      horrible clutter among them, and in general they all took to their heels,
      only that we could observe that some walked off with more gravity and
      majesty than others, being not so much frighted at the noise and fire; and
      we could perceive that some were left upon the ground struggling as for
      life, but we durst not stir out to see what they were.
    
    
      Indeed they stood so thick, and were so near us, that we could not well
      miss killing or wounding some of them, and we believed they had certainly
      the smell of us, and our victuals we had been killing; for we had killed a
      deer, and three or four of those creatures like goats the day before; and
      some of the offal had been thrown out behind our camp, and this, we
      suppose, drew them so much about us; but we avoided it for the future.
    
    
      Though the creatures fled, yet we heard a frightful roaring all night at
      the place where they stood, which we supposed was from some that were
      wounded, and as soon as day came we went out to see what execution we had
      done. And indeed it was a strange sight; there were three tigers and two
      wolves quite killed, besides the creature I had killed within our
      palisade, which seemed to be of an ill-gendered kind, between a tiger and
      a leopard. Besides this there was a noble old lion alive, but with both
      his fore-legs broke, so that he could not stir away, and he had almost
      beat himself to death with struggling all night, and we found that this
      was the wounded soldier that had roared so loud and given us so much
      disturbance. Our surgeon, looking at him, smiled. "Now," says he, "if I
      could be sure this lion would be as grateful to me as one of his majesty's
      ancestors was to Androcles, the Roman slave, I would certainly set both
      his legs again and cure him." I had not heard the story of Androcles, so
      he told it me at large; but as to the surgeon, we told him he had no way
      to know whether the lion would do so or not, but to cure him first and
      trust to his honour; but he had no faith, so to despatch him and put him
      out of his torment, he shot him in the head and killed him, for which we
      called him the king-killer ever after.
    
    
      Our negroes found no less than five of these ravenous creatures wounded
      and dropped at a distance from our quarters; whereof, one was a wolf, one
      a fine spotted young leopard, and the other were creatures that we knew
      not what to call them.
    
    
      We had several more of these gentlefolks about after that, but no such
      general rendezvous of them as that was any more; but this ill effect it
      had to us, that it frighted the deer and other creatures from our
      neighbourhood, of whose company we were much more desirous, and which were
      necessary for our subsistence. However, our negroes went out every day
      a-hunting, as they called it, with bow and arrow, and they scarce ever
      failed of bringing us home something or other; and particularly we found
      in this part of the country, after the rains had fallen some time,
      abundance of wild fowl, such as we have in England, duck, teal, widgeon,
      etc.; some geese, and some kinds that we had never seen before; and we
      frequently killed them. Also we catched a great deal of fresh fish out of
      the river, so that we wanted no provision. If we wanted anything, it was
      salt to eat with our fresh meat; but we had a little left, and we used it
      sparingly; for as to our negroes, they could not taste it, nor did they
      care to eat any meat that was seasoned with it.
    
    
      The weather began now to clear up, the rains were down, and the floods
      abated, and the sun, which had passed our zenith, was gone to the
      southward a good way; so we prepared to go on our way.
    
    
      It was the 12th of October, or thereabouts, that we began to set forward;
      and having an easy country to travel in, as well as to supply us with
      provisions, though still without inhabitants, we made more despatch,
      travelling sometimes, as we calculated it, twenty or twenty-five miles a
      day; nor did we halt anywhere in eleven days' march, one day excepted,
      which was to make a raft to carry us over a small river, which, having
      swelled with the rains, was not yet quite down.
    
    
      When we were past this river, which, by the way, ran to the northward too,
      we found a great row of hills in our way. We saw, indeed, the country open
      to the right at a great distance; but, as we kept true to our course, due
      west, we were not willing to go a great way out of our way, only to shun a
      few hills. So we advanced; but we were surprised when, being not quite
      come to the top, one of our company, who, with two negroes, was got up
      before us, cried out, "The sea! the sea!" and fell a-dancing and jumping,
      as signs of joy.
    
    
      The gunner and I were most surprised at it, because we had but that
      morning been calculating that we must have yet above 1000 miles on the sea
      side, and that we could not expect to reach it till another rainy season
      would be upon us; so that when our man cried out, "The sea," the gunner
      was angry, and said he was mad.
    
    
      But we were both in the greatest surprise imaginable, when, coming to the
      top of the hill, and though it was very high, we saw nothing but water,
      either before us or to the right hand or the left, being a vast sea,
      without any bounds but the horizon.
    
    
      We went down the hill full of confusion of thought, not being able to
      conceive whereabouts we were or what it must be, seeing by all our charts
      the sea was yet a vast way off.
    
    
      It was not above three miles from the hills before we came to the shore,
      or water-edge of this sea, and there, to our further surprise, we found
      the water fresh and pleasant to drink; so that, in short, we knew not what
      course to take. The sea, as we thought it to be, put a full stop to our
      journey (I mean westward), for it lay just in the way. Our next question
      was, which hand to turn to, to the right hand or the left, but this was
      soon resolved; for, as we knew not the extent of it, we considered that
      our way, if it had been the sea really, must be on the north, and
      therefore, if we went to the south now, it must be just so much out of our
      way at last. So, having spent a good part of the day in our surprise at
      the thing, and consulting what to do, we set forward to the north.
    
    
      We travelled upon the shore of this sea full twenty-three days before we
      could come to any resolution about what it was; at the end of which, early
      one morning, one of our seamen cried out, "Land!" and it was no false
      alarm, for we saw plainly the tops of some hills at a very great distance,
      on the further side of the water, due west; but though this satisfied us
      that it was not the ocean, but an inland sea or lake, yet we saw no land
      to the northward, that is to say, no end of it, but were obliged to travel
      eight days more, and near 100 miles farther, before we came to the end of
      it, and then we found this lake or sea ended in a very great river which
      ran N. or N. by E., as the other river had done which I mentioned before.
    
    
      My friend the gunner, upon examining, said that he believed that he was
      mistaken before, and that this was the river Nile, but was still of the
      mind that we were of before, that we should not think of a voyage into
      Egypt that way; so we resolved upon crossing this river, which, however,
      was not so easy as before, the river being very rapid and the channel very
      broad.
    
    
      It cost us, therefore, a week here to get materials to waft ourselves and
      cattle over this river; for though here were stores of trees, yet there
      was none of any considerable growth sufficient to make a canoe.
    
    
      During our march on the edge of this bank we met with great fatigue, and
      therefore travelled a fewer miles in a day than before, there being such a
      prodigious number of little rivers that came down from the hills on the
      east side, emptying themselves into this gulf, all which waters were
      pretty high, the rains having been but newly over.
    
    
      In the last three days of our travel we met with some inhabitants, but we
      found they lived upon the little hills and not by the water-side; nor were
      we a little put to it for food in this march, having killed nothing for
      four or five days but some fish we caught out of the lake, and that not in
      such plenty as we found before.
    
    
      But, to make us some amends, we had no disturbance upon all the shores of
      this lake from any wild beasts; the only inconveniency of that kind was,
      that we met an ugly, venomous, deformed kind of a snake or serpent in the
      wet grounds near the lake, that several times pursued us as if it would
      attack us; and if we struck or threw anything at it, it would raise itself
      up and hiss so loud that it might be heard a great way. It had a hellish
      ugly deformed look and voice, and our men would not be persuaded but it
      was the devil, only that we did not know what business Satan could have
      there, where there were no people.
    
    
      It was very remarkable that we had now travelled 1000 miles without
      meeting with any people in the heart of the whole continent of Africa,
      where, to be sure, never man set his foot since the sons of Noah spread
      themselves over the face of the whole earth. Here also our gunner took an
      observation with his forestaff, to determine our latitude, and he found
      now, that having marched about thirty-three days northward, we were in 6
      degrees 22 minutes south latitude.
    
    
      After having with great difficulty got over this river, we came into a
      strange wild country that began a little to affright us; for though the
      country was not a desert of dry scalding sand as that was we had passed
      before, yet it was mountainous, barren, and infinitely full of most
      furious wild beasts, more than any place we had passed yet. There was
      indeed a kind of coarse herbage on the surface, and now and then a few
      trees, or rather shrubs. But people we could see none, and we began to be
      in great suspense about victuals, for we had not killed a deer a great
      while, but had lived chiefly upon fish and fowl, always by the water-side,
      both which seemed to fail us now; and we were in the more consternation,
      because we could not lay in a stock here to proceed upon, as we did
      before, but were obliged to set out with scarcity, and without any
      certainty of a supply.
    
    
      We had, however, no remedy but patience; and having killed some fowls and
      dried some fish, as much as, with short allowance, we reckoned would last
      us five days, we resolved to venture, and venture we did; nor was it
      without cause that we were apprehensive of the danger, for we travelled
      the five days and met neither with fish nor fowl, nor four-footed beast,
      whose flesh was fit to eat, and we were in a most dreadful apprehension of
      being famished to death. On the sixth day we almost fasted, or, as we may
      say, we ate up all the scraps of what we had left, and at night lay down
      supperless upon our mats, with heavy hearts, being obliged the eighth day
      to kill one of our poor faithful servants, the buffaloes that carried our
      baggage. The flesh of this creature was very good, and so sparingly did we
      eat of it that it lasted us all three days and a half, and was just spent;
      and we were on the point of killing another when we saw before us a
      country that promised better, having high trees and a large river in the
      middle of it.
    
    
      This encouraged us, and we quickened our march for the river-side, though
      with empty stomachs, and very faint and weak; but before we came to this
      river we had the good hap to meet with some young deer, a thing we had
      long wished for. In a word, having shot three of them, we came to a full
      stop to fill our bellies, and never gave the flesh time to cool before we
      ate it; nay, it was much we could stay to kill it and had not eaten it
      alive, for we were, in short, almost famished.
    
    
      Through all that inhospitable country we saw continually lions, tigers,
      leopards, civet cats, and abundance of kinds of creatures that we did not
      understand; we saw no elephants, but every now and then we met with an
      elephant's tooth lying on the ground, and some of them lying, as it were,
      half buried by the length of time that they had lain there.
    
    
      When we came to the shore of this river, we found it ran northerly still,
      as all the rest had done, but with this difference, that as the course of
      the other rivers were N. by E. or N.N.E., the course of this lay N.W.N.
    
    
      On the farther bank of this river we saw some sign of inhabitants, but met
      with none for the first day; but the next day we came into an inhabited
      country, the people all negroes, and stark naked, without shame, both men
      and women.
    
    
      We made signs of friendship to them, and found them a very frank, civil,
      and friendly sort of people. They came to our negroes without any
      suspicion, nor did they give us any reason to suspect them of any
      villainy, as the others had done; we made signs to them that we were
      hungry, and immediately some naked women ran and fetched us great
      quantities of roots, and of things like pumpkins, which we made no scruple
      to eat; and our artificer showed them some of his trinkets that he had
      made, some of iron, some of silver, but none of gold. They had so much
      judgment as to choose that of silver before the iron; but when we showed
      them some gold, we found they did not value it so much as either of the
      other.
    
    
      For some of these things they brought us more provisions, and three living
      creatures as big as calves, but not of that kind; neither did we ever see
      any of them before; their flesh was very good; and after that they brought
      us twelve more, and some smaller creatures like hares; all which were very
      welcome to us, who were indeed at a very great loss for provisions.
    
    
      We grew very intimate with these people, and indeed they were the
      civillest and most friendly people that we met with at all, and mightily
      pleased with us; and, which was very particular, they were much easier to
      be made to understand our meaning than any we had met with before.
    
    
      At last we began to inquire our way, pointing to the west. They made us
      understand easily that we could not go that way, but they pointed to us
      that we might go north-west, so that we presently understood that there
      was another lake in our way, which proved to be true; for in two days more
      we saw it plain, and it held us till we passed the equinoctial line, lying
      all the way on our left hand, though at a great distance.
    
    
      Travelling thus northward, our gunner seemed very anxious about our
      proceedings; for he assured us, and made me sensible of it by the maps
      which he had been teaching me out of, that when we came into the latitude
      of six degrees, or thereabouts, north of the line, the land trended away
      to the west to such a length that we should not come at the sea under a
      march of above 1500 miles farther westward than the country we desired to
      go to. I asked him if there were no navigable rivers that we might meet
      with, which, running into the west ocean, might perhaps carry us down
      their stream, and then, if it were 1500 miles, or twice 1500 miles, we
      might do well enough if we could but get provisions.
    
    
      Here he showed me the maps again, and that there appeared no river whose
      stream was of any such a length as to do any kindness, till we came
      perhaps within 200 or 300 miles of the shore, except the Rio Grande, as
      they call it, which lay farther northward from us, at least 700 miles; and
      that then he knew not what kind of country it might carry us through; for
      he said it was his opinion that the heats on the north of the line, even
      in the same latitude, were violent, and the country more desolate, barren,
      and barbarous, than those of the south; and that when we came among the
      negroes in the north part of Africa, next the sea, especially those who
      had seen and trafficked with the Europeans, such as Dutch, English,
      Portuguese, Spaniards, etc., they had most of them been so ill-used at
      some time or other that they would certainly put all the spite they could
      upon us in mere revenge.
    
    
      Upon these considerations he advised us that, as soon as we had passed
      this lake, we should proceed W.S.W., that is to say, a little inclining to
      the south, and that in time we should meet with the great river Congo,
      from whence the coast is called Congo, being a little north of Angola,
      where we intended at first to go.
    
    
      I asked him if ever he had been on the coast of Congo. He said, yes, he
      had, but was never on shore there. Then I asked him how we should get from
      thence to the coast where the European ships came, seeing, if the land
      trended away west for 1500 miles, we must have all that shore to traverse
      before we could double the west point of it.
    
    
      He told me it was ten to one but we should hear of some European ships to
      take us in, for that they often visited the coast of Congo and Angola, in
      trade with the negroes; and that if we could not, yet, if we could but
      find provisions, we should make our way as well along the sea-shore as
      along the river, till we came to the Gold Coast, which, he said, was not
      above 400 or 500 miles north of Congo, besides the turning of the coast
      west about 300 more; that shore being in the latitude of six or seven
      degrees; and that there the English, or Dutch, or French had settlements
      or factories, perhaps all of them.
    
    
      I confess I had more mind, all the while he argued, to have gone
      northward, and shipped ourselves in the Rio Grande, or, as the traders
      call it, the river Negro or Niger, for I knew that at last it would bring
      us down to the Cape de Verd, where we were sure of relief; whereas, at the
      coast we were going to now, we had a prodigious way still to go, either by
      sea or land, and no certainty which way to get provisions but by force;
      but for the present I held my tongue, because it was my tutor's opinion.
    
    
      But when, according to his desire, we came to turn southward, having
      passed beyond the second great lake, our men began all to be uneasy, and
      said we were now out of our way for certain, for that we were going
      farther from home, and that we were indeed far enough off already.
    
    
      But we had not marched above twelve days more, eight whereof were taken up
      in rounding the lake, and four more south-west, in order to make for the
      river Congo, but we were put to another full stop, by entering a country
      so desolate, so frightful, and so wild, that we knew not what to think or
      do; for, besides that it appeared as a terrible and boundless desert,
      having neither woods, trees, rivers, or inhabitants, so even the place
      where we were was desolate of inhabitants, nor had we any way to gather in
      a stock of provisions for the passing of this desert, as we did before at
      our entering the first, unless we had marched back four days to the place
      where we turned the head of the lake.
    
    
      Well, notwithstanding this, we ventured; for, to men that had passed such
      wild places as we had done, nothing could seem too desperate to undertake.
      We ventured, I say, and the rather because we saw very high mountains in
      our way at a great distance, and we imagined, wherever there were
      mountains there would be springs and rivers; where rivers there would be
      trees and grass; where trees and grass there would be cattle; and where
      cattle, some kind of inhabitants. At last, in consequence of this
      speculative philosophy, we entered this waste, having a great heap of
      roots and plants for our bread, such as the Indians gave us, a very little
      flesh or salt, and but a little water.
    
    
      We travelled two days towards those hills, and still they seemed as far
      off as they did at first, and it was the fifth day before we got to them;
      indeed, we travelled but softly, for it was excessively hot; and we were
      much about the very equinoctial line, we hardly knew whether to the south
      or the north of it.
    
    
      As we had concluded, that where there were hills there would be springs,
      so it happened; but we were not only surprised, but really frighted, to
      find the first spring we came to, and which looked admirably clear and
      beautiful, to be salt as brine. It was a terrible disappointment to us,
      and put us under melancholy apprehensions at first; but the gunner, who
      was of a spirit never discouraged, told us we should not be disturbed at
      that, but be very thankful, for salt was a bait we stood in as much need
      of as anything, and there was no question but we should find fresh water
      as well as salt; and here our surgeon stepped in to encourage us, and told
      us that if we did not know he would show us a way how to make that salt
      water fresh, which indeed made us all more cheerful, though we wondered
      what he meant.
    
    
      Meantime our men, without bidding, had been seeking about for other
      springs, and found several; but still they were all salt; from whence we
      concluded that there was a salt rock or mineral stone in those mountains,
      and perhaps they might be all of such a substance; but still I wondered by
      what witchcraft it was that our artist the surgeon would make this salt
      water turn fresh, and I longed to see the experiment, which was indeed a
      very odd one; but he went to work with as much assurance as if he had
      tried it on the very spot before.
    
    
      He took two of our large mats and sewed them together, and they made a
      kind of a bag four feet broad, three feet and a half high, and about a
      foot and a half thick when it was full.
    
    
      He caused us to fill this bag with dry sand and tread it down as close as
      we could, not to burst the mats. When thus the bag was full within a foot,
      he sought some other earth and filled up the rest with it, and still trod
      all in as hard as he could. When he had done, he made a hole in the upper
      earth about as broad as the crown of a large hat, or something bigger
      about, but not so deep, and bade a negro fill it with water, and still as
      it shrunk away to fill it again, and keep it full. The bag he had placed
      at first across two pieces of wood, about a foot from the ground; and
      under it he ordered some of our skins to be spread that would hold water.
      In about an hour, and not sooner, the water began to come dropping through
      the bottom of the bag, and, to our great surprise, was perfectly fresh and
      sweet, and this continued for several hours; but in the end the water
      began to be a little brackish. When we told him that, "Well, then," said
      he, "turn the sand out, and fill it again." Whether he did this by way of
      experiment from his own fancy, or whether he had seen it done before, I do
      not remember.
    
    
      The next day we mounted the tops of the hills, where the prospect was
      indeed astonishing, for as far as the eye could look, south, or west, or
      northwest, there was nothing to be seen but a vast howling wilderness,
      with neither tree nor river, nor any green thing. The surface we found, as
      the part we passed the day before, had a kind of thick moss upon it, of a
      blackish dead colour, but nothing in it that looked like food, either for
      man or beast.
    
    
      Had we been stored with provisions to have entered for ten or twenty days
      upon this wilderness, as we were formerly, and with fresh water, we had
      hearts good enough to have ventured, though we had been obliged to come
      back again, for if we went north we did not know but we might meet with
      the same; but we neither had provisions, neither were we in any place
      where it was possible to get them. We killed some wild ferine creatures at
      the foot of these hills; but, except two things, like to nothing that we
      ever saw before, we met with nothing that was fit to eat. These were
      creatures that seemed to be between the kind of a buffalo and a deer, but
      indeed resembled neither; for they had no horns, and had great legs like a
      cow, with a fine head, and the neck like a deer. We killed also, at
      several times, a tiger, two young lions, and a wolf; but, God be thanked,
      we were not so reduced as to eat carrion.
    
    
      Upon this terrible prospect I renewed my motion of turning northward, and
      making towards the river Niger or Rio Grande, then to turn west towards
      the English settlements on the Gold Coast; to which every one most readily
      consented, only our gunner, who was indeed our best guide, though he
      happened to be mistaken at this time. He moved that, as our coast was now
      northward, so we might slant away north-west, that so, by crossing the
      country, we might perhaps meet with some other river that run into the Rio
      Grande northward, or down to the Gold Coast southward, and so both direct
      our way and shorten the labour; as also because, if any of the country was
      inhabited and fruitful, we should probably find it upon the shore of the
      rivers, where alone we could be furnished with provisions.
    
    
      This was good advice, and too rational not to be taken; but our present
      business was, what to do to get out of this dreadful place we were in.
      Behind us was a waste, which had already cost us five days' march, and we
      had not provisions for five days left to go back again the same way.
      Before us was nothing but horror, as above; so we resolved, seeing the
      ridge of the hills we were upon had some appearance of fruitfulness, and
      that they seemed to lead away to the northward a great way, to keep under
      the foot of them on the east side, to go on as far as we could, and in the
      meantime to look diligently out for food.
    
    
      Accordingly we moved on the next morning; for we had no time to lose, and,
      to our great comfort, we came in our first morning's march to very good
      springs of fresh water; and lest we should have a scarcity again, we
      filled all our bladder bottles and carried it with us. I should also have
      observed that our surgeon, who made the salt water fresh, took the
      opportunity of those salt springs, and made us the quantity of three or
      four pecks of very good salt.
    
    
      In our third march we found an unexpected supply of food, the hills being
      full of hares. They were of a kind something different from ours in
      England, larger and not as swift of foot, but very good meat. We shot
      several of them, and the little tame leopard, which I told you we took at
      the negro town that we plundered, hunted them like a dog, and killed us
      several every day; but she would eat nothing of them unless we gave it
      her, which, indeed, in our circumstance, was very obliging. We salted them
      a little and dried them in the sun whole, and carried a strange parcel
      along with us. I think it was almost three hundred, for we did not know
      when we might find any more, either of these or any other food. We
      continued our course under these hills very comfortably for eight or nine
      days, when we found, to our great satisfaction, the country beyond us
      began to look with something of a better countenance. As for the west side
      of the hills, we never examined it till this day, when three of our
      company, the rest halting for refreshment, mounted the hills again to
      satisfy their curiosity, but found it all the same, nor could they see any
      end of it, no, not to the north, the way we were going; so the tenth day,
      finding the hills made a turn, and led as it were into the vast desert, we
      left them and continued our course north, the country being very tolerably
      full of woods, some waste, but not tediously long, till we came, by our
      gunner's observation, into the latitude of eight degrees five minutes,
      which we were nineteen days more in performing.
    
    
      All this way we found no inhabitants, but abundance of wild ravenous
      creatures, with which we became so well acquainted now that really we did
      not much mind them. We saw lions and tigers and leopards every night and
      morning in abundance; but as they seldom came near us, we let them go
      about their business: if they offered to come near us, we made false fire
      with any gun that was uncharged, and they would walk off as soon as they
      saw the flash.
    
    
      We made pretty good shift for food all this way; for sometimes we killed
      hares, sometimes some fowls, but for my life I cannot give names to any of
      them, except a kind of partridge, and another that was like our turtle.
      Now and then we began to meet with elephants again in great numbers; those
      creatures delighted chiefly in the woody part of the country.
    
    
      This long-continued march fatigued us very much, and two of our men fell
      sick, indeed, so very sick that we thought they would have died; and one
      of our negroes died suddenly. Our surgeon said it was an apoplexy, but he
      wondered at it, he said, for he could never complain of his high feeding.
      Another of them was very ill; but our surgeon with much ado persuading
      him, indeed it was almost forcing him to be let blood, he recovered.
    
    
      We halted here twelve days for the sake of our sick men, and our surgeon
      persuaded me and three or four more of us to be let blood during the time
      of rest, which, with other things he gave us, contributed very much to our
      continued health in so tedious a march and in so hot a climate.
    
    
      In this march we pitched our matted tents every night, and they were very
      comfortable to us, though we had trees and woods to shelter us in most
      places. We thought it very strange that in all this part of the country we
      yet met with no inhabitants; but the principal reason, as we found
      afterwards, was, that we, having kept a western course first, and then a
      northern course, were gotten too much into the middle of the country and
      among the deserts; whereas the inhabitants are principally found among the
      rivers, lakes, and lowlands, as well to the south-west as to the north.
    
    
      What little rivulets we found here were so empty of water, that except
      some pits, and little more than ordinary pools, there was scarcely any
      water to be seen in them; and they rather showed that during the rainy
      months they had a channel, than that they had really running water in them
      at that time, by which it was easy for us to judge that we had a great way
      to go; but this was no discouragement so long as we had but provisions,
      and some seasonable shelter from the violent heat, which indeed I thought
      was much greater now than when the sun was just over our heads.
    
    
      Our men being recovered, we set forward again, very well stored with
      provisions, and water sufficient, and bending our course a little to the
      westward of the north, travelled in hopes of some favourable stream which
      might bear a canoe; but we found none till after twenty days' travel,
      including eight days' rest; for our men being weak, we rested very often,
      especially when we came to places which were proper for our purpose, where
      we found cattle, fowl, or anything to kill for our food. In those twenty
      days' march we advanced four degrees to the northward, besides some
      meridian distance westward, and we met with abundance of elephants, and
      with a good number of elephants' teeth scattered up and down, here and
      there, in the woody grounds especially, some of which were very large. But
      they were no booty to us; our business was provisions, and a good passage
      out of the country; and it had been much more to our purpose to have found
      a good fat deer, and to have killed it for our food, than a hundred ton of
      elephants' teeth; and yet, as you shall presently hear, when we came to
      begin our passage by water, we once thought to have built a large canoe,
      on purpose to have loaded it with ivory; but this was when we knew nothing
      of the rivers, nor knew anything how dangerous and how difficult a passage
      it was we were likely to have in them, nor had considered the weight of
      carriage to lug them to the rivers where we might embark.
    
    
      At the end of twenty days' travel, as above, in the latitude of three
      degrees sixteen minutes, we discovered in a valley, at some distance from
      us, a pretty tolerable stream, which we thought deserved the name of a
      river, and which ran its course N.N.W., which was just what we wanted. As
      we had fixed our thoughts upon our passage by water, we took this for the
      place to make the experiment, and bent our march directly to the valley.
    
    
      There was a small thicket of trees just in our way, which we went by,
      thinking no harm, when on a sudden one of our negroes was dangerously
      wounded with an arrow shot into his back, slanting between his shoulders.
      This put us to a full stop; and three of our men, with two negroes,
      spreading the wood, for it was but a small one, found a negro with a bow,
      but no arrow, who would have escaped, but our men that discovered him shot
      him in revenge of the mischief he had done; so we lost the opportunity of
      taking him prisoner, which, if we had done, and sent him home with good
      usage, it might have brought others to us in a friendly manner.
    
    
      Going a little farther, we came to five negro huts or houses, built after
      a different manner from any we had seen yet; and at the door of one of
      them lay seven elephants' teeth, piled up against the wall or side of the
      hut, as if they had been provided against a market. Here were no men, but
      seven or eight women, and near twenty children. We offered them no
      incivility of any kind, but gave them every one a bit of silver beaten out
      thin, as I observed before, and cut diamond fashion, or in the shape of a
      bird, at which the women were overjoyed, and brought out to us several
      sorts of food, which we did not understand, being cakes of a meal made of
      roots, which they bake in the sun, and which ate very well. We went a
      little way farther and pitched our camp for that night, not doubting but
      our civility to the women would produce some good effect when their
      husbands might come home.
    
    
      Accordingly, the next morning the women, with eleven men, five young boys,
      and two good big girls, came to our camp. Before they came quite to us,
      the women called aloud, and made an odd screaming noise to bring us out;
      and accordingly we came out, when two of the women, showing us what we had
      given them, and pointing to the company behind, made such signs as we
      could easily understand signified friendship. When the men advanced,
      having bows and arrows, they laid them down on the ground, scraped and
      threw sand over their heads, and turned round three times with their hands
      laid up upon the tops of their heads. This, it seems, was a solemn vow of
      friendship. Upon this we beckoned them with our hands to come nearer; then
      they sent the boys and girls to us first, which, it seems, was to bring us
      more cakes of bread and some green herbs to eat, which we received, and
      took the boys up and kissed them, and the little girls too; then the men
      came up close to us, and sat them down on the ground, making signs that we
      should sit down by them, which we did. They said much to one another, but
      we could not understand them, nor could we find any way to make them
      understand us, much less whither we were going, or what we wanted, only
      that we easily made them understand we wanted victuals; whereupon one of
      the men, casting his eyes about him towards a rising ground that was about
      half a mile off, started up as if he was frighted, flew to the place where
      they had laid down their bows and arrows, snatched up a bow and two
      arrows, and ran like a racehorse to the place. When he came there, he let
      fly both his arrows, and comes back again to us with the same speed. We,
      seeing he came with the bow, but without the arrows, were the more
      inquisitive; but the fellow, saying nothing to us, beckons to one of our
      negroes to come to him, and we bid him go; so he led him back to the
      place, where lay a kind of deer, shot with two arrows, but not quite dead,
      and between them they brought it down to us. This was for a gift to us,
      and was very welcome, I assure you, for our stock was low. These people
      were all stark naked.
    
    
      The next day there came about a hundred men to us, and women making the
      same awkward signals of friendship, and dancing, and showing themselves
      very well pleased, and anything they had they gave us. How the man in the
      wood came to be so butcherly and rude as to shoot at our men, without
      making any breach first, we could not imagine; for the people were simple,
      plain, and inoffensive in all our other conversation with them.
    
    
      From hence we went down the banks of the little river I mentioned, and
      where, I found, we should see the whole nation of negroes, but whether
      friendly to us or not, that we could make no judgment of yet.
    
    
      The river was no use to us, as to the design of making canoes, a great
      while; and we traversed the country on the edge of it about five days
      more, when our carpenters, finding the stream increased, proposed to pitch
      our tents, and fall to work to make canoes; but after we had begun the
      work, and cut down two or three trees, and spent five days in the labour,
      some of our men, wandering further down the river, brought us word that
      the stream rather decreased than increased, sinking away into the sands,
      or drying up by the heat of the sun, so that the river appeared not able
      to carry the least canoe that could be any way useful to us; so we were
      obliged to give over our enterprise and move on.
    
    
      In our further prospect this way, we marched three days full west, the
      country on the north side being extraordinary mountainous, and more
      parched and dry than any we had seen yet; whereas, in the part which looks
      due west, we found a pleasant valley running a great way between two great
      ridges of mountains. The hills looked frightful, being entirely bare of
      trees or grass, and even white with the dryness of the sand; but in the
      valley we had trees, grass, and some creatures that were fit for food, and
      some inhabitants.
    
    
      We passed by some of their huts or houses, and saw people about them, but
      they ran up into the hills as soon as they saw us. At the end of this
      valley we met with a peopled country, and at first it put us to some doubt
      whether we should go among them, or keep up towards the hills northerly;
      and as our aim was principally as before, to make our way to the river
      Niger, we inclined to the latter, pursuing our course by the compass to
      the N.W. We marched thus without interruption seven days more, when we met
      with a surprising circumstance much more desolate and disconsolate than
      our own, and which, in time to come, will scarce seem credible.
    
    
      We did not much seek the conversing, or acquainting ourselves with the
      natives of the country, except where we found the want of them for our
      provision, or their direction for our way; so that, whereas we found the
      country here begin to be very populous, especially towards our left hand,
      that is, to the south, we kept at the more distance northerly, still
      stretching towards the west.
    
    
      In this tract we found something or other to kill and eat, which always
      supplied our necessity, though not so well as we were provided in our
      first setting out; being thus, as it were, pushing to avoid a peopled
      country, we at last came to a very pleasant, agreeable stream of water,
      not big enough to be called a river, but running to the N.N.W., which was
      the very course we desired to go.
    
    
      On the farthest bank of this brook, we perceived some huts of negroes, not
      many, and in a little low spot of ground, some maize, or Indian corn,
      growing, which intimated presently to us, that there were some inhabitants
      on that side less barbarous than what we had met with in other places
      where we had been.
    
    
      As we went forward, our whole caravan being in a body, our negroes, who
      were in the front, cried out, that they saw a white man! We were not much
      surprised at first, it being, as we thought, a mistake of the fellows, and
      asked them what they meant; when one of them stepped to me, and pointing
      to a hut on the other side of the hill, I was astonished to see a white
      man indeed, but stark naked, very busy near the door of his hut, and
      stooping down to the ground with something in his hand, as if he had been
      at some work; and his back being towards us, he did not see us.
    
    
      I gave notice to our negroes to make no noise, and waited till some more
      of our men were come up, to show the sight to them, that they might be
      sure I was not mistaken; and we were soon satisfied of the truth, for the
      man, having heard some noise, started up, and looked full at us, as much
      surprised, to be sure, as we were, but whether with fear or hope, we then
      knew not.
    
    
      As he discovered us, so did the rest of the inhabitants belonging to the
      huts about him, and all crowded together, looking at us at a distance, a
      little bottom, in which the brook ran, lying between us; the white man,
      and all the rest, as he told us afterwards, not knowing well whether they
      should stay or run away. However, it presently came into my thoughts, that
      if there were white men among them, it would be much easier to make them
      understand what we meant as to peace or war, than we found it with others;
      so tying a piece of white rag to the end of a stick, we sent two negroes
      with it to the bank of the water, carrying the pole up as high as they
      could; it was presently understood, and two of their men and the white man
      came to the shore on the other side.
    
    
      However, as the white man spoke no Portuguese, they could understand
      nothing of one another but by signs; but our men made the white man
      understand that they had white men with them too, at which they said the
      white man laughed. However, to be short, our men came back, and told us
      they were all good friends, and in about an hour four of our men, two
      negroes, and the black prince, went to the river-side, where the white man
      came to them.
    
    
      They had not been half a quarter of an hour, but a negro came running to
      me, and told me the white man was Inglese, as he called him; upon which I
      ran back, eagerly enough, you may be sure, with him, and found, as he
      said, that he was an Englishman; upon which he embraced me very
      passionately, the tears running down his face. The first surprise of his
      seeing us was over before we came, but any one may conceive it by the
      brief account he gave us afterwards of his very unhappy circumstances, and
      of so unexpected a deliverance, such as perhaps never happened to any man
      in the world, for it was a million to one odds that ever he could have
      been relieved; nothing but an adventure that never was heard or read of
      before could have suited his case, unless Heaven, by some miracle that
      never was to be expected, had acted for him.
    
    
      He appeared to be a gentleman, not an ordinary-bred fellow, seaman, or
      labouring man; this showed itself in his behaviour in the first moment of
      our conversing with him, and in spite of all the disadvantages of his
      miserable circumstances.
    
    
      He was a middle-aged man, not above thirty-seven or thirty-eight, though
      his beard was grown exceedingly long, and the hair of his head and face
      strangely covered him to the middle of his back and breast; he was white,
      and his skin very fine, though discoloured, and in some places blistered,
      and covered with a brown blackish substance, scurfy, scaly, and hard,
      which was the effect of the scorching heat of the sun; he was stark naked,
      and had been so, as he told us, upwards of two years.
    
    
      He was so exceedingly transported at our meeting with him, that he could
      scarce enter into any discourse at all with us that day; and when he could
      get away from us for a little, we saw him walking alone, and showing all
      the most extravagant tokens of an ungovernable joy; and even afterwards he
      was never without tears in his eyes for several days, upon the least word
      spoken by us of his circumstances, or by him of his deliverance.
    
    
      We found his behaviour the most courteous and endearing I ever saw in any
      man whatever, and most evident tokens of a mannerly, well-bred person
      appeared in all things he did or said, and our people were exceedingly
      taken with him. He was a scholar and a mathematician; he could not speak
      Portuguese indeed, but he spoke Latin to our surgeon, French to another of
      our men, and Italian to a third.
    
    
      He had no leisure in his thoughts to ask us whence we came, whither we
      were going, or who we were; but would have it always as an answer to
      himself, that to be sure, wherever we were a-going, we came from Heaven,
      and were sent on purpose to save him from the most wretched condition that
      ever man was reduced to.
    
    
      Our men pitching their camp on the bank of a little river opposite to him,
      he began to inquire what store of provisions we had, and how we proposed
      to be supplied. When he found that our store was but small, he said he
      would talk with the natives, and we should have provisions enough; for he
      said they were the most courteous, good-natured part of the inhabitants in
      all that part of the country, as we might suppose by his living so safe
      among them.
    
    
      The first things this gentleman did for us were indeed of the greatest
      consequence to us; for, first, he perfectly informed us where we were, and
      which was the properest course for us to steer; secondly, he put us in the
      way how to furnish ourselves effectually with provisions; and thirdly, he
      was our complete interpreter and peacemaker with all the natives, who now
      began to be very numerous about us, and who were a more fierce and politic
      people than those we had met with before; not so easily terrified with our
      arms as those, and not so ignorant as to give their provisions and corn
      for our little toys, such as, I said before, our artificer made; but as
      they had frequently traded and conversed with the Europeans on the coast,
      or with other negro nations that had traded and been concerned with them,
      they were the less ignorant and the less fearful, and consequently nothing
      was to be had from them but by exchange for such things as they liked.
    
    
      This I say of the negro natives, which we soon came among; but as to these
      poor people that he lived among, they were not much acquainted with
      things, being at the distance of above 300 miles from the coast; only that
      they found elephants' teeth upon the hills to the north, which they took
      and carried about sixty or seventy miles south, where other trading
      negroes usually met them, and gave them beads, glass, shells, and cowries,
      for them, such as the English and Dutch and other traders furnish them
      with from Europe.
    
    
      We now began to be more familiar with our new acquaintance; and first,
      though we made but a sorry figure as to clothes ourselves, having neither
      shoe, or stocking, or glove, or hat among us, and but very few shirts, yet
      as well as we could we clothed him; and first, our surgeon having scissors
      and razors, shaved him, and cut his hair; a hat, as I say, we had not in
      all our stores, but he supplied himself by making himself a cap of a piece
      of a leopard-skin, most artificially. As for shoes or stockings, he had
      gone so long without them that he cared not even for the buskins and
      foot-gloves we wore, which I described above.
    
    
      As he had been curious to hear the whole story of our travels, and was
      exceedingly delighted with the relation, so we were no less to know, and
      pleased with, the account of his circumstances, and the history of his
      coming to that strange place alone, and in that condition which we found
      him in, as above. This account of his would indeed be in itself the
      subject of an agreeable history, and would be as long and diverting as our
      own, having in it many strange and extraordinary incidents; but we cannot
      have room here to launch out into so long a digression: the sum of his
      history was this:       
    
    
      He had been a factor for the English Guinea Company at Sierra Leone, or
      some other of their settlements which had been taken by the French, where
      he had been plundered of all his own effects, as well as of what was
      entrusted to him by the company. Whether it was that the company did not
      do him justice in restoring his circumstances, or in further employing
      him, he quitted their service, and was employed by those called separate
      traders, and being afterwards out of employ there also, traded on his own
      account; when, passing unwarily into one of the company's settlements, he
      was either betrayed into the hands of some of the natives, or, somehow or
      other, was surprised by them. However, as they did not kill him, he found
      means to escape from them at that time, and fled to another nation of the
      natives, who, being enemies to the other, entertained him friendly, and
      with them he lived some time; but not liking his quarters or his company,
      he fled again, and several times changed his landlords: sometimes was
      carried by force, sometimes hurried by fear, as circumstances altered with
      him (the variety of which deserves a history by itself), till at last he
      had wandered beyond all possibility of return, and had taken up his abode
      where we found him, where he was well received by the petty king of the
      tribe he lived with; and he, in return, instructed them how to value the
      product of their labour, and on what terms to trade with those negroes who
      came up to them for teeth.
    
    
      As he was naked, and had no clothes, so he was naked of arms for his
      defence, having neither gun, sword, staff, or any instrument of war about
      him, no, not to guard himself against the attacks of a wild beast, of
      which the country was very full. We asked him how he came to be so
      entirely abandoned of all concern for his safety? He answered, that to
      him, that had so often wished for death, life was not worth defending; and
      that, as he was entirely at the mercy of the negroes, they had much the
      more confidence in him, seeing he had no weapons to hurt them. As for wild
      beasts, he was not much concerned about that, for he scarce ever went from
      his hut; but if he did, the negro king and his men went all with him, and
      they were all armed with bows and arrows, and lances, with which they
      would kill any of the ravenous creatures, lions as well as others; but
      that they seldom came abroad in the day; and if the negroes wander
      anywhere in the night, they always build a hut for themselves, and make a
      fire at the door of it, which is guard enough.
    
    
      We inquired of him what we should next do towards getting to the seaside.
      He told us we were about one hundred and twenty English leagues from the
      coast, where almost all the European settlements and factories were, and
      which is called the Gold Coast; but that there were so many different
      nations of negroes in the way, that it was ten to one if we were not
      either fought with continually, or starved for want of provisions; but
      that there were two other ways to go, which, if he had had any company to
      go with him, he had often contrived to make his escape by. The one was to
      travel full west, which, though it was farther to go, yet was not so full
      of people, and the people we should find would be so much the civiller to
      us, or be so much the easier to fight with; or that the other way was, if
      possible, to get to the Rio Grande, and go down the stream in canoes. We
      told him, that was the way we had resolved on before we met with him; but
      then he told us there was a prodigious desert to go over, and as
      prodigious woods to go through, before we came to it, and that both
      together were at least twenty days' march for us, travel as hard as we
      could.
    
    
      We asked him if there were no horses in the country, or asses, or even
      bullocks or buffaloes, to make use of in such a journey, and we showed him
      ours, of which we had but three left. He said no, all the country did not
      afford anything of that kind.
    
    
      He told us that in this great wood there were immense numbers of
      elephants; and upon the desert, great multitudes of lions, lynxes, tigers,
      leopards,      c.; and that it was to that wood and that desert that the
      negroes went to get elephants' teeth, where they never failed to find a
      great number.
    
    
      We inquired still more, and particularly the way to the Gold Coast, and if
      there were no rivers to ease us in our carriage; and told him, as to the
      negroes fighting with us, we were not much concerned at that; nor were we
      afraid of starving, for if they had any victuals among them, we would have
      our share of it; and, therefore, if he would venture to show us the way,
      we would venture to go; and as for himself, we told him we would live and
      die together       there should not a man of us stir from him.
    
    
      He told us, with all his heart, if we resolved it, and would venture, we
      might be assured he would take his fate with us, and he would endeavour to
      guide us in such a way as we should meet with some friendly savages who
      would use us well, and perhaps stand by us against some others, who were
      less tractable; so, in a word, we all resolved to go full south for the
      Gold Coast.
    
    
      The next morning he came to us again, and being all met in council, as we
      may call it, he began to talk very seriously with us, that since we were
      now come, after a long journey, to a view of the end of our troubles, and
      had been so obliging to him as to offer to carry him with us, he had been
      all night revolving in his mind what he and we all might do to make
      ourselves some amends for all our sorrows; and first, he said, he was to
      let me know that we were just then in one of the richest parts of the
      world, though it was really otherwise but a desolate, disconsolate
      wilderness; "for," says he, "there is not a river but runs gold       not
      a desert but without ploughing bears a crop of ivory. What mines of gold,
      what immense stores of gold, those mountains may contain, from whence
      these rivers come, or the shores which these waters run by, we know not,
      but may imagine that they must be inconceivably rich, seeing so much is
      washed down the stream by the water washing the sides of the land, that
      the quantity suffices all the traders which the European world send
      thither." We asked him how far they went for it, seeing the ships only
      trade upon the coast. He told us that the negroes on the coast search the
      rivers up for the length of 150 or 200 miles, and would be out a month, or
      two, or three at a time, and always come home sufficiently rewarded;
      "but," says he, "they never come thus far, and yet hereabouts is as much
      gold as there." Upon this he told us that he believed he might have gotten
      a hundred pounds' weight of gold since he came thither, if he had employed
      himself to look and work for it; but as he knew not what to do with it,
      and had long since despaired of being ever delivered from the misery he
      was in, he had entirely omitted it. "For what advantage had it been to
      me," said he, "or what richer had I been, if I had a ton of gold dust, and
      lay and wallowed in it? The richness of it," said he, "would not give me
      one moment's felicity, nor relieve me in the present exigency. Nay," says
      he, "as you all see, it would not buy me clothes to cover me, or a drop of
      drink to save me from perishing. It is of no value here," says he; "there
      are several people among these huts that would weigh gold against a few
      glass beads or a cockle-shell, and give you a handful of gold-dust for a
      handful of cowries." N.B.       These are little shells which our children
      call blackamoors' teeth.
    
    
      When he had said thus he pulled out a piece of an earthen pot baked hard
      in the sun. "Here," says he, "is some of the dirt of this country, and if
      I would I could have got a great deal more;" and, showing it to us, I
      believe there was in it between two and three pounds weight of gold-dust,
      of the same kind and colour with that we had gotten already, as before.
      After we had looked at it a while, he told us, smiling, we were his
      deliverers, and all he had, as well as his life, was ours; and therefore,
      as this would be of value to us when we came to our own country, so he
      desired we would accept of it among us; and that was the only time that he
      had repented that he had picked up no more of it.
    
    
      I spoke for him, as his interpreter, to my comrades, and in their names
      thanked him; but, speaking to them in Portuguese, I desired them to defer
      the acceptance of his kindness to the next morning; and so I did, telling
      him we would further talk of this part in the morning; so we parted for
      that time.
    
    
      When he was gone I found they were all wonderfully affected with his
      discourse, and with the generosity of his temper, as well as the
      magnificence of his present, which in another place had been
      extraordinary. Upon the whole, not to detain you with circumstances, we
      agreed that, seeing he was now one of our number, and that as we were a
      relief to him in carrying him out of the dismal condition he was in, so he
      was equally a relief to us, in being our guide through the rest of the
      country, our interpreter with the natives, and our director how to manage
      with the savages, and how to enrich ourselves with the wealth of the
      country; that, therefore, we would put his gold among our common stock,
      and every one should give him as much as would make his up just as much as
      any single share of our own, and for the future we would take our lot
      together, taking his solemn engagement to us, as we had before one to
      another, that we would not conceal the least grain of gold we found one
      from another.
    
    
      In the next conference we acquainted him with the adventures of the Golden
      River, and how we had shared what we got there, so that every man had a
      larger stock than he for his share; that, therefore, instead of taking any
      from him, we had resolved every one to add a little to him. He appeared
      very glad that we had met with such good success, but would not take a
      grain from us, till at last, pressing him very hard, he told us, that then
      he would take it thus:       that, when we came to get any more, he would
      have so much out of the first as should make him even, and then we would
      go on as equal adventurers; and thus we agreed.
    
    
      He then told us he thought it would not be an unprofitable adventure if,
      before we set forward, and after we had got a stock of provisions, we
      should make a journey north to the edge of the desert he had told us of,
      from whence our negroes might bring every one a large elephant's tooth,
      and that he would get some more to assist; and that, after a certain
      length of carriage, they might be conveyed by canoes to the coast, where
      they would yield a very great profit.
    
    
      I objected against this on account of our other design we had of getting
      gold-dust; and that our negroes, who we knew would be faithful to us,
      would get much more by searching the rivers for gold for us than by
      lugging a great tooth of a hundred and fifty pounds weight a hundred miles
      or more, which would be an insufferable labour to them after so hard a
      journey, and would certainly kill them.
    
    
      He acquiesced in the justice of this answer, but fain would have had us
      gone to see the woody part of the hill and the edge of the desert, that we
      might see how the elephants' teeth lay scattered up and down there; but
      when we told him the story of what we had seen before, as is said above,
      he said no more.
    
    
      We stayed here twelve days, during which time the natives were very
      obliging to us, and brought us fruits, pompions, and a root like carrots,
      though of quite another taste, but not unpleasant neither, and some
      guinea-fowls, whose names we did not know. In short, they brought us
      plenty of what they had, and we lived very well, and we gave them all such
      little things as our cutler had made, for he had now a whole bag full of
      them.
    
    
      On the thirteenth day we set forward, taking our new gentleman with us. At
      parting, the negro king sent two savages with a present to him of some
      dried flesh, but I do not remember what it was, and he gave him again
      three silver birds which our cutler helped him to, which I assure you was
      a present for a king.
    
    
      We travelled now south, a little west, and here we found the first river
      for above 2000 miles' march, whose waters run south, all the rest running
      north or west. We followed this river, which was no bigger than a good
      large brook in England, till it began to increase its water. Every now and
      then we found our Englishman went down as it were privately to the water,
      which was to try the land; at length, after a day's march upon this river,
      he came running up to us with his hands full of sand, and saying, "Look
      here." Upon looking we found that a good deal of gold lay spangled among
      the sand of the river. "Now," says he, "I think we may begin to work;" so
      he divided our negroes into couples and set them to work, to search and
      wash the sand and ooze in the bottom of the water where it was not deep.
    
    
      In the first day and a quarter our men all together had gathered a pound
      and two ounces of gold or thereabouts, and as we found the quantity
      increased the farther we went, we followed it about three days, till
      another small rivulet joined the first, and then searching up the stream,
      we found gold there too; so we pitched our camp in the angle where the
      rivers joined, and we diverted ourselves, as I may call it, in washing the
      gold out of the sand of the river, and in getting provisions.
    
    
      Here we stayed thirteen days more, in which time we had many pleasant
      adventures with the savages, too long to mention here, and some of them
      too homely to tell of, for some of our men had made something free with
      their women, which, had not our new guide made peace for us with one of
      their men at the price of seven fine bits of silver, which our artificer
      had cut out into the shapes of lions, and fishes, and birds, and had
      punched holes to hang them up by (an inestimable treasure), we must have
      gone to war with them and all their people.
    
    
      All the while we were busy washing gold-dust out of the rivers, and our
      negroes the like, our ingenious cutler was hammering and cutting, and he
      was grown so dexterous by use that he formed all manner of images. He cut
      out elephants, tigers, civet cats, ostriches, eagles, cranes, fowls,
      fishes, and indeed whatever he pleased, in thin plates of hammered gold,
      for his silver and iron were almost all gone.
    
    
      At one of the towns of these savage nations we were very friendly received
      by their king, and as he was very much taken with our workman's toys, he
      sold him an elephant cut out of a gold plate as thin as a sixpence at an
      extravagant rate. He was so much taken with it that he would not be quiet
      till he had given him almost a handful of gold-dust, as they call it; I
      suppose it might weigh three-quarters of a pound; the piece of gold that
      the elephant was made of might be about the weight of a pistole, rather
      less than more. Our artist was so honest, though the labour and art were
      all his own, that he brought all the gold and put it into our common
      stock; but we had, indeed, no manner of reason in the least to be
      covetous, for, as our new guide told us, we that were strong enough to
      defend ourselves, and had time enough to stay (for we were none of us in
      haste), might in time get together what quantity of gold we pleased, even
      to an hundred pounds weight each man if we thought fit; and therefore he
      told us, though he had as much reason to be sick of the country as any of
      us, yet if we thought to turn our march a little to the south-east, and
      pitch upon a place proper for our headquarters, we might find provisions
      plenty enough, and extend ourselves over the country among the rivers for
      two or three years to the right and left, and we should soon find the
      advantage of it.
    
    
      The proposal, however good as to the profitable part of it, suited none of
      us, for we were all more desirous to get home than to be rich, being tired
      of the excessive fatigue of above a year's continual wandering among
      deserts and wild beasts.
    
    
      However, the tongue of our new acquaintance had a kind of charm in it, and
      used such arguments, and had so much the power of persuasion, that there
      was no resisting him. He told us it was preposterous not to take the fruit
      of all our labours now we were come to the harvest; that we might see the
      hazard the Europeans run with ships and men, and at great expense, to
      fetch a little gold, and that we, that were in the centre of it, to go
      away empty-handed was unaccountable; that we were strong enough to fight
      our way through whole nations, and might make our journey afterward to
      what part of the coast we pleased, and we should never forgive ourselves
      when we came to our own country to see we had 500 pistoles in gold, and
      might as easily have had 5000 or 10,000, or what we pleased; that he was
      no more covetous than we, but seeing it was in all our powers to retrieve
      our misfortunes at once, and to make ourselves easy for all our lives, he
      could not be faithful to us, or grateful for the good we had done him, if
      he did not let us see the advantage we had in our hands; and he assured us
      he would make it clear to our own understanding, that we might in two
      years' time, by good management and by the help of our negroes, gather
      every man a hundred pounds weight of gold, and get together perhaps two
      hundred ton of teeth; whereas, if once we pushed on to the coast and
      separated, we should never be able to see that place again with our eyes,
      or do any more than sinners did with heaven,       wish themselves there,
      but know they can never come at it.
    
    
      Our surgeon was the first man that yielded to his reasoning, and after him
      the gunner; and they too, indeed, had a great influence over us, but none
      of the rest had any mind to stay, nor I neither, I must confess; for I had
      no notion of a great deal of money, or what to do with myself, or what to
      do with it if I had it. I thought I had enough already, and all the
      thoughts I had about disposing of it, if I came to Europe, was only how to
      spend it as fast as I could, buy me some clothes, and go to sea again to
      be a drudge for more.
    
    
      However, he prevailed with us by his good words at last to stay but for
      six months in the country, and then, if we did resolve to go, he would
      submit; so at length we yielded to that, and he carried us about fifty
      English miles south-east, where we found several rivulets of water, which
      seemed to come all from a great ridge of mountains, which lay to the
      north-east, and which, by our calculation, must be the beginning that way
      of the great waste, which we had been forced northward to avoid.
    
    
      Here we found the country barren enough, but yet we had by his direction
      plenty of food; for the savages round us, upon giving them some of our
      toys, as I have so often mentioned, brought us in whatever they had; and
      here we found some maize, or Indian wheat, which the negro women planted,
      as we sow seeds in a garden, and immediately our new provider ordered some
      of our negroes to plant it, and it grew up presently, and by watering it
      often, we had a crop in less than three months' growth.
    
    
      As soon as we were settled, and our camp fixed, we fell to the old trade
      of fishing for gold in the rivers mentioned above, and our English
      gentleman so well knew how to direct our search, that we scarce ever lost
      our labour.
    
    
      One time, having set us to work, he asked if we would give him leave, with
      four or five negroes, to go out for six or seven days to seek his fortune,
      and see what he could discover in the country, assuring us whatever he got
      should be for the public stock. We all gave him our consent, and lent him
      a gun; and two of our men desiring to go with him, they took then six
      negroes with them, and two of our buffaloes that came with us the whole
      journey; they took about eight days' provision of bread with them, but no
      flesh, except about as much dried flesh as would serve them two days.
    
    
      They travelled up to the top of the mountains I mentioned just now, where
      they saw (as our men afterwards vouched it to be) the same desert which we
      were so justly terrified at when we were on the farther side, and which,
      by our calculation, could not be less than 300 miles broad and above 600
      miles in length, without knowing where it ended.
    
    
      The journal of their travels is too long to enter upon here. They stayed
      out two-and-fifty days, when they brought us seventeen pound and something
      more (for we had no exact weight) of gold-dust, some of it in much larger
      pieces than any we had found before, besides about fifteen ton of
      elephants' teeth, which he had, partly by good usage and partly by bad,
      obliged the savages of the country to fetch, and bring down to him from
      the mountains, and which he made others bring with him quite down to our
      camp. Indeed, we wondered what was coming to us when we saw him attended
      with above 200 negroes; but he soon undeceived us, when he made them all
      throw down their burdens on a heap at the entrance of our camp.
    
    
      Besides this, they brought two lions' skins, and five leopards' skins,
      very large and very fine. He asked our pardon for his long stay, and that
      he had made no greater a booty, but told us he had one excursion more to
      make, which he hoped should turn to a better account.
    
    
      So, having rested himself and rewarded the savages that brought the teeth
      for him with some bits of silver and iron cut out diamond fashion, and
      with two shaped like little dogs, he sent them away mightily pleased.
    
    
      The second journey he went, some more of our men desired to go with him,
      and they made a troop of ten white men and ten savages, and the two
      buffaloes to carry their provisions and ammunition. They took the same
      course, only not exactly the same track, and they stayed thirty-two days
      only, in which time they killed no less than fifteen leopards, three
      lions, and several other creatures, and brought us home four-and-twenty
      pound some ounces of gold-dust, and only six elephants' teeth, but they
      were very great ones.
    
    
      Our friend the Englishman showed us that now our time was well bestowed,
      for in five months which we had stayed here, we had gathered so much
      gold-dust that, when we came to share it, we had five pound and a quarter
      to a man, besides what we had before, and besides six or seven pound
      weight which we had at several times given our artificer to make baubles
      with. And now we talked of going forward to the coast to put an end to our
      journey; but our guide laughed at us then. "Nay, you can't go now," says
      he, "for the rainy season begins next month, and there will be no stirring
      then." This we found, indeed, reasonable, so we resolved to furnish
      ourselves with provisions, that we might not be obliged to go abroad too
      much in the rain, and we spread ourselves some one way and some another,
      as far as we cared to venture, to get provisions; and our negroes killed
      us some deer, which we cured as well as we could in the sun, for we had
      now no salt.
    
    
      By this time the rainy months were set in, and we could scarce, for above
      two months, look out of our huts. But that was not all, for the rivers
      were so swelled with the land-floods, that we scarce knew the little
      brooks and rivulets from the great navigable rivers. This had been a very
      good opportunity to have conveyed by water, upon rafts, our elephants'
      teeth, of which we had a very great pile; for, as we always gave the
      savages some reward for their labour, the very women would bring us teeth
      upon every opportunity, and sometimes a great tooth carried between two;
      so that our quantity was increased to about two-and-twenty ton of teeth.
    
    
      As soon as the weather proved fair again, he told us he would not press us
      to any further stay, since we did not care whether we got any more gold or
      no; that we were indeed the first men he ever met with in his life that
      said they had gold enough, and of whom it might be truly said, that, when
      it lay under our feet, we would not stoop to take it up. But, since he had
      made us a promise, he would not break it, nor press us to make any further
      stay; only he thought he ought to tell us that now was the time, after the
      land-flood, when the greatest quantity of gold was found; and that, if we
      stayed but one month, we should see thousands of savages spread themselves
      over the whole country to wash the gold out of the sand, for the European
      ships which would come on the coast; that they do it then, because the
      rage of the floods always works down a great deal of gold out of the
      hills; and, if we took the advantage to be there before them, we did not
      know what extraordinary things we might find.
    
    
      This was so forcible, and so well argued, that it appeared in all our
      faces we were prevailed upon; so we told him we would all stay: for though
      it was true we were all eager to be gone, yet the evident prospect of so
      much advantage could not well be resisted; that he was greatly mistaken,
      when he suggested that we did not desire to increase our store of gold,
      and in that we were resolved to make the utmost use of the advantage that
      was in our hands, and would stay as long as any gold was to be had, if it
      was another year.
    
    
      He could hardly express the joy he was in on this occasion; and the fair
      weather coming on, we began, just as he directed, to search about the
      rivers for more gold. At first we had but little encouragement, and began
      to be doubtful; but it was very plain that the reason was, the water was
      not fully fallen, or the rivers reduced to their usual channel; but in a
      few days we were fully requited, and found much more gold than at first,
      and in bigger lumps; and one of our men washed out of the sand a piece of
      gold as big as a small nut, which weighed, by our estimation       for we
      had no small weights       almost an ounce and a half.
    
    
      This success made us extremely diligent; and in little more than a month
      we had altogether gotten near sixty pound weight of gold; but after this,
      as he told us, we found abundance of the savages, men, women, and
      children, hunting every river and brook, and even the dry land of the
      hills for gold; so that we could do nothing like then, compared to what we
      had done before.
    
    
      But our artificer found a way to make other people find us in gold without
      our own labour; for, when these people began to appear, he had a
      considerable quantity of his toys, birds, beasts,      c., such as before,
      ready for them; and the English gentleman being the interpreter, he
      brought the savages to admire them; so our cutler had trade enough, and,
      to be sure, sold his goods at a monstrous rate; for he would get an ounce
      of gold, sometimes two, for a bit of silver, perhaps of the value of a
      groat; nay, if it were iron and if it was of gold, they would not give the
      more for it; and it was incredible almost to think what a quantity of gold
      he got that way.
    
    
      In a word, to bring this happy journey to a conclusion, we increased our
      stock of gold here, in three months' stay more, to such a degree that,
      bringing it all to a common stock, in order to share it, we divided almost
      four pound weight again to every man; and then we set forward for the Gold
      Coast, to see what method we could find out for our passage into Europe.
    
    
      There happened several remarkable incidents in this part of our journey,
      as to how we were, or were not, received friendly by the several nations
      of savages through which we passed; how we delivered one negro king from
      captivity, who had been a benefactor to our new guide; and now our guide,
      in gratitude, by our assistance, restored him to his kingdom, which,
      perhaps, might contain about 300 subjects; how he entertained us; and how
      he made his subjects go with our Englishmen, and fetch all our elephants'
      teeth which we had been obliged to leave behind us, and to carry them for
      us to the river, the name of which I forgot, where we made rafts, and in
      eleven days more came down to one of the Dutch settlements on the Gold
      Coast, where we arrived in perfect health, and to our great satisfaction.
      As for our cargo of teeth, we sold it to the Dutch factory, and received
      clothes and other necessaries for ourselves, and such of our negroes as we
      thought fit to keep with us; and it is to be observed, that we had four
      pound of gunpowder left when we ended our journey. The negro prince we
      made perfectly free, clothed him out of our common stock, and gave him a
      pound and a half of gold for himself, which he knew very well how to
      manage; and here we all parted after the most friendly manner possible.
      Our Englishman remained in the Dutch factory some time, and, as I heard
      afterwards, died there of grief; for he having sent a thousand pounds
      sterling over to England, by the way of Holland, for his refuge at his
      return to his friends, the ship was taken by the French and the effects
      all lost.
    
    
      The rest of my comrades went away, in a small bark, to the two Portuguese
      factories, near Gambia, in the latitude of fourteen; and I, with two
      negroes which I kept with me, went away to Cape Coast Castle, where I got
      passage for England, and arrived there in September; and thus ended my
      first harvest of wild oats; the rest were not sowed to so much advantage.
    
    
      I had neither friend, relation, nor acquaintance in England, though it was
      my native country; I had consequently no person to trust with what I had,
      or to counsel me to secure or save it; but, falling into ill company, and
      trusting the keeper of a public-house in Rotherhithe with a great part of
      my money, and hastily squandering away the rest, all that great sum, which
      I got with so much pains and hazard, was gone in little more than two
      years' time; and, as I even rage in my own thoughts to reflect upon the
      manner how it was wasted, so I need record no more; the rest merits to be
      concealed with blushes, for that it was spent in all kinds of folly and
      wickedness. So this scene of my life may be said to have begun in theft,
      and ended in luxury; a sad setting-out, and a worse coming home.
    
    
      About the year                I began to see the bottom of my stock, and
      that it was time to think of further adventures; for my spoilers, as I
      call them, began to let me know, that as my money declined, their respect
      would ebb with it, and that I had nothing to expect of them further than
      as I might command it by the force of my money, which, in short, would not
      go an inch the further for all that had been spent in their favour before.
    
    
      This shocked me very much, and I conceived a just abhorrence of their
      ingratitude; but it wore off; nor had I met with any regret at the wasting
      so glorious a sum of money as I brought to England with me.
    
    
      I next shipped myself, in an evil hour to be sure, on a voyage to Cadiz,
      in a ship called the               , and in the course of our voyage,
      being on the coast of Spain, was obliged to put into the Groyn, by a
      strong southwest wind.
    
    
      Here I fell into company with some masters of mischief; and, among them,
      one, forwarder than the rest, began an intimate confidence with me, so
      that we called one another brothers, and communicated all our
      circumstances to one another. His name was Harris. This fellow came to me
      one morning, asking me if I would go on shore, and I agreed; so we got the
      captain's leave for the boat, and went together. When we were together, he
      asked me if I had a mind for an adventure that might make amends for all
      past misfortunes. I told him, yes, with all my heart; for I did not care
      where I went, having nothing to lose, and no one to leave behind me.
    
    
      He then asked me if I would swear to be secret, and that, if I did not
      agree to what he proposed, I would nevertheless never betray him. I
      readily bound myself to that, upon the most solemn imprecations and curses
      that the devil and both of us could invent.
    
    
      He told me, then, there was a brave fellow in the other ship, pointing to
      another English ship which rode in the harbour, who, in concert with some
      of the men, had resolved to mutiny the next morning, and run away with the
      ship; and that, if we could get strength enough among our ship's company,
      we might do the same. I liked the proposal very well, and he got eight of
      us to join with him, and he told us, that as soon as his friend had begun
      the work, and was master of the ship, we should be ready to do the like.
      This was his plot; and I, without the least hesitation, either at the
      villainy of the fact or the difficulty of performing it, came immediately
      into the wicked conspiracy, and so it went on among us; but we could not
      bring our part to perfection.
    
    
      Accordingly, on the day appointed, his correspondent in the other ship,
      whose name was Wilmot, began the work, and, having seized the captain's
      mate and other officers, secured the ship, and gave the signal to us. We
      were but eleven in our ship, who were in the conspiracy, nor could we get
      any more that we could trust; so that, leaving the ship, we all took the
      boat, and went off to join the other.
    
    
      Having thus left the ship I was in, we were entertained with a great deal
      of joy by Captain Wilmot and his new gang; and, being well prepared for
      all manner of roguery, bold, desperate (I mean myself), without the least
      checks of conscience for what I was entered upon, or for anything I might
      do, much less with any apprehension of what might be the consequence of
      it; I say, having thus embarked with this crew, which at last brought me
      to consort with the most famous pirates of the age, some of whom have
      ended their journals at the gallows, I think the giving an account of some
      of my other adventures may be an agreeable piece of story; and this I may
      venture to say beforehand, upon the word of a pirate, that I shall not be
      able to recollect the full, no, not by far, of the great variety which has
      formed one of the most reprobate schemes that ever man was capable to
      present to the world.
    
    
      I that was, as I have hinted before, an original thief, and a pirate, even
      by inclination before, was now in my element, and never undertook anything
      in my life with more particular satisfaction.
    
    
      Captain Wilmot (for so we are now to call him) being thus possessed of a
      ship, and in the manner as you have heard, it may be easily concluded he
      had nothing to do to stay in the port, or to wait either the attempts that
      might be made from the shore, or any change that might happen among his
      men. On the contrary, we weighed anchor the same tide, and stood out to
      sea, steering away for the Canaries. Our ship had twenty-two guns, but was
      able to carry thirty; and besides, as she was fitted out for a
      merchant-ship only, she was not furnished either with ammunition or
      small-arms sufficient for our design, or for the occasion we might have in
      case of a fight. So we put into Cadiz, that is to say, we came to an
      anchor in the bay; and the captain, and one whom we called young Captain
      Kidd, who was the gunner, [landed,] and some of the men who could best be
      trusted, among whom was my comrade Harris, who was made second mate, and
      myself, who was made a lieutenant. Some bales of English goods were
      proposed to be carried on shore with us for sale, but my comrade, who was
      a complete fellow at his business, proposed a better way for it; and
      having been in the town before, told us, in short, that he would buy what
      powder and bullet, small-arms, or anything else we wanted, on his own
      word, to be paid for when they came on board, in such English goods as we
      had there. This was much the best way, and accordingly he and the captain
      went on shore by themselves, and having made such a bargain as they found
      for their turn, came away again in two hours' time, and bringing only a
      butt of wine and five casks of brandy with them, we all went on board
      again.
    
    
      The next morning two barcos longos came off to us, deeply laden,
      with five Spaniards on board them, for traffic. Our captain sold them good
      pennyworths, and they delivered us sixteen barrels of powder, twelve small
      rundlets of fine powder for our small-arms, sixty muskets, and twelve
      fusees for the officers; seventeen ton of cannon-ball, fifteen barrels of
      musket-bullets, with some swords and twenty good pair of pistols. Besides
      this, they brought thirteen butts of wine (for we, that were now all
      become gentlemen, scorned to drink the ship's beer), also sixteen
      puncheons of brandy, with twelve barrels of raisins and twenty chests of
      lemons; all which we paid for in English goods; and, over and above, the
      captain received six hundred pieces of eight in money. They would have
      come again, but we would stay no longer.
    
    
      From hence we sailed to the Canaries, and from thence onward to the West
      Indies, where we committed some depredation upon the Spaniards for
      provisions, and took some prizes, but none of any great value, while I
      remained with them, which was not long at that time; for, having taken a
      Spanish sloop on the coast of Carthagena, my friend made a motion to me,
      that we should desire Captain Wilmot to put us into the sloop, with a
      proportion of arms and ammunition, and let us try what we could do; she
      being much fitter for our business than the great ship, and a better
      sailer. This he consented to, and we appointed our rendezvous at Tobago,
      making an agreement, that whatever was taken by either of our ships should
      be shared among the ship's company of both; all which we very punctually
      observed, and joined our ships again, about fifteen months after, at the
      island of Tobago, as above.
    
    
      We cruised near two years in those seas, chiefly upon the Spaniards; not
      that we made any difficulty of taking English ships, or Dutch, or French,
      if they came in our way; and particularly, Captain Wilmot attacked a New
      England ship bound from the Madeiras to Jamaica, and another bound from
      New York to Barbados, with provisions; which last was a very happy supply
      to us. But the reason why we meddled as little with English vessels as we
      could, was, first, because, if they were ships of any force, we were sure
      of more resistance from them; and, secondly, because we found the English
      ships had less booty when taken, for the Spaniards generally had money on
      board, and that was what we best knew what to do with. Captain Wilmot was,
      indeed, more particularly cruel when he took any English vessel, that they
      might not too soon have advice of him in England; and so the men-of-war
      have orders to look out for him. But this part I bury in silence for the
      present.
    
    
      We increased our stock in these two years considerably, having taken
      60,000 pieces of eight in one vessel, and 100,000 in another; and being
      thus first grown rich, we resolved to be strong too, for we had taken a
      brigantine built at Virginia, an excellent sea-boat, and a good sailer,
      and able to carry twelve guns; and a large Spanish frigate-built ship,
      that sailed incomparably well also, and which afterwards, by the help of
      good carpenters, we fitted up to carry twenty-eight guns. And now we
      wanted more hands, so we put away for the Bay of Campeachy, not doubting
      we should ship as many men there as we pleased; and so we did.
    
    
      Here we sold the sloop that I was in; and Captain Wilmot keeping his own
      ship, I took the command of the Spanish frigate as captain, and my comrade
      Harris as eldest lieutenant, and a bold enterprising fellow he was, as any
      the world afforded. One culverdine was put into the brigantine, so that we
      were now three stout ships, well manned, and victualled for twelve months;
      for we had taken two or three sloops from New England and New York, laden
      with flour, peas, and barrelled beef and pork, going for Jamaica and
      Barbados; and for more beef we went on shore on the island of Cuba, where
      we killed as many black cattle as we pleased, though we had very little
      salt to cure them.
    
    
      Out of all the prizes we took here we took their powder and bullet, their
      small-arms and cutlasses; and as for their men, we always took the surgeon
      and the carpenter, as persons who were of particular use to us upon many
      occasions; nor were they always unwilling to go with us, though for their
      own security, in case of accidents, they might easily pretend they were
      carried away by force; of which I shall give a pleasant account in the
      course of my other expeditions.
    
    
      We had one very merry fellow here, a Quaker, whose name was William
      Walters, whom we took out of a sloop bound from Pennsylvania to Barbados.
      He was a surgeon, and they called him doctor; but he was not employed in
      the sloop as a surgeon, but was going to Barbados to get a berth, as the
      sailors call it. However, he had all his surgeon's chests on board, and we
      made him go with us, and take all his implements with him. He was a comic
      fellow indeed, a man of very good solid sense, and an excellent surgeon;
      but, what was worth all, very good-humoured and pleasant in his
      conversation, and a bold, stout, brave fellow too, as any we had among us.
    
    
      I found William, as I thought, not very averse to go along with us, and
      yet resolved to do it so that it might be apparent he was taken away by
      force, and to this purpose he comes to me. "Friend," says he, "thou sayest
      I must go with thee, and it is not in my power to resist thee if I would;
      but I desire thou wilt oblige the master of the sloop which I am on board
      to certify under his hand, that I was taken away by force and against my
      will." And this he said with so much satisfaction in his face, that I
      could not but understand him. "Ay, ay," says I, "whether it be against
      your will or no, I'll make him and all the men give you a certificate of
      it, or I'll take them all along with us, and keep them till they do." So I
      drew up a certificate myself, wherein I wrote that he was taken away by
      main force, as a prisoner, by a pirate ship; that they carried away his
      chest and instruments first, and then bound his hands behind him and
      forced him into their boat; and this was signed by the master and all his
      men.
    
    
      Accordingly I fell a-swearing at him, and called to my men to tie his
      hands behind him, and so we put him into our boat and carried him away.
      When I had him on board, I called him to me. "Now, friend," says I, "I
      have brought you away by force, it is true, but I am not of the opinion I
      have brought you away so much against your will as they imagine. Come,"
      says I, "you will be a useful man to us, and you shall have very good
      usage among us." So I unbound his hands, and first ordered all things that
      belonged to him to be restored to him, and our captain gave him a dram.
    
    
      "Thou hast dealt friendly by me," says he, "and I will be plain with thee,
      whether I came willingly to thee or not. I shall make myself as useful to
      thee as I can, but thou knowest it is not my business to meddle when thou
      art to fight." "No, no," says the captain, "but you may meddle a little
      when we share the money." "Those things are useful to furnish a surgeon's
      chest," says William, and smiled, "but I shall be moderate."
    
    
      In short, William was a most agreeable companion; but he had the better of
      us in this part, that if we were taken we were sure to be hanged, and he
      was sure to escape; and he knew it well enough. But, in short, he was a
      sprightly fellow, and fitter to be captain than any of us. I shall have
      often an occasion to speak of him in the rest of the story.
    
    
      Our cruising so long in these seas began now to be so well known, that not
      in England only, but in France and Spain, accounts had been made public of
      our adventures, and many stories told how we murdered the people in cold
      blood, tying them back to back, and throwing them into the sea; one half
      of which, however, was not true, though more was done than is fit to speak
      of here.
    
    
      The consequence of this, however, was, that several English men-of-war
      were sent to the West Indies, and were particularly instructed to cruise
      in the Bay of Mexico, and the Gulf of Florida, and among the Bahama
      islands, if possible, to attack us. We were not so ignorant of things as
      not to expect this, after so long a stay in that part of the world; but
      the first certain account we had of them was at Honduras, when a vessel
      coming in from Jamaica told us that two English men-of-war were coming
      directly from Jamaica thither in quest of us. We were indeed as it were
      embayed, and could not have made the least shift to have got off, if they
      had come directly to us; but, as it happened, somebody had informed them
      that we were in the Bay of Campeachy, and they went directly thither, by
      which we were not only free of them, but were so much to the windward of
      them, that they could not make any attempt upon us, though they had known
      we were there.
    
    
      We took this advantage, and stood away for Carthagena, and from thence
      with great difficulty beat it up at a distance from under the shore for
      St. Martha, till we came to the Dutch island of Curacoa, and from thence
      to the island of Tobago, which, as before, was our rendezvous; which,
      being a deserted, uninhabited island, we at the same time made use of for
      a retreat. Here the captain of the brigantine died, and Captain Harris, at
      that time my lieutenant, took the command of the brigantine.
    
    
      Here we came to a resolution to go away to the coast of Brazil, and from
      thence to the Cape of Good Hope, and so for the East Indies; but Captain
      Harris, as I have said, being now captain of the brigantine, alleged that
      his ship was too small for so long a voyage, but that, if Captain Wilmot
      would consent, he would take the hazard of another cruise, and he would
      follow us in the first ship he could take. So we appointed our rendezvous
      to be at Madagascar, which was done by my recommendation of the place, and
      the plenty of provisions to be had there.
    
    
      Accordingly, he went away from us in an evil hour; for, instead of taking
      a ship to follow us, he was taken, as I heard afterwards, by an English
      man-of-war, and being laid in irons, died of mere grief and anger before
      he came to England. His lieutenant, I have heard, was afterwards executed
      in England for a pirate; and this was the end of the man who first brought
      me into this unhappy trade.
    
    
      We parted from Tobago three days after, bending our course for the coast
      of Brazil, but had not been at sea above twenty-four hours, when we were
      separated by a terrible storm, which held three days, with very little
      abatement or intermission. In this juncture Captain Wilmot happened,
      unluckily, to be on board my ship, to his great mortification; for we not
      only lost sight of his ship, but never saw her more till we came to
      Madagascar, where she was cast away. In short, after having in this
      tempest lost our fore-topmast, we were forced to put back to the isle of
      Tobago for shelter, and to repair our damage, which brought us all very
      near our destruction.
    
    
      We were no sooner on shore here, and all very busy looking out for a piece
      of timber for a topmast, but we perceived standing in for the shore an
      English man-of-war of thirty-six guns. It was a great surprise to us
      indeed, because we were disabled so much; but, to our great good fortune,
      we lay pretty snug and close among the high rocks, and the man-of-war did
      not see us, but stood off again upon his cruise. So we only observed which
      way she went, and at night, leaving our work, resolved to stand off to
      sea, steering the contrary way from that which we observed she went; and
      this, we found, had the desired success, for we saw him no more. We had
      gotten an old mizzen-topmast on board, which made us a jury fore-topmast
      for the present; and so we stood away for the isle of Trinidad, where,
      though there were Spaniards on shore, yet we landed some men with our
      boat, and cut a very good piece of fir to make us a new topmast, which we
      got fitted up effectually; and also we got some cattle here to eke out our
      provisions; and calling a council of war among ourselves, we resolved to
      quit those seas for the present, and steer away for the coast of Brazil.
    
    
      The first thing we attempted here was only getting fresh water, but we
      learnt that there lay the Portuguese fleet at the bay of All Saints, bound
      for Lisbon, ready to sail, and only waited for a fair wind. This made us
      lie by, wishing to see them put to sea, and, accordingly as they were with
      or without convoy, to attack or avoid them.
    
    
      It sprung up a fresh gale in the evening at S.W. by W., which, being fair
      for the Portugal fleet, and the weather pleasant and agreeable, we heard
      the signal given to unmoor, and running in under the island of Si       -,
      we hauled our mainsail and foresail up in the brails, lowered the topsails
      upon the cap, and clewed them up, that we might lie as snug as we could,
      expecting their coming out, and the next morning saw the whole fleet come
      out accordingly, but not at all to our satisfaction, for they consisted of
      twenty-six sail, and most of them ships of force, as well as burthen, both
      merchantmen and men-of-war; so, seeing there was no meddling, we lay still
      where we were also, till the fleet was out of sight, and then stood off
      and on, in hopes of meeting with further purchase.
    
    
      It was not long before we saw a sail, and immediately gave her chase; but
      she proved an excellent sailer, and, standing out to sea, we saw plainly
      she trusted to her heels       that is to say, to her sails. However, as
      we were a clean ship, we gained upon her, though slowly, and had we had a
      day before us, we should certainly have come up with her; but it grew dark
      apace, and in that case we knew we should lose sight of her.
    
    
      Our merry Quaker, perceiving us to crowd still after her in the dark,
      wherein we could not see which way she went, came very dryly to me.
      "Friend Singleton," says he, "dost thee know what we are a-doing?" Says I,
      "Yes; why, we are chasing yon ship, are we not?" "And how dost thou know
      that?" says he, very gravely still. "Nay, that's true," says I again; "we
      cannot be sure." "Yes, friend," says he, "I think we may be sure that we
      are running away from her, not chasing her. I am afraid," adds he, "thou
      art turned Quaker, and hast resolved not to use the hand of power, or art
      a coward, and art flying from thy enemy."
    
    
      "What do you mean?" says I (I think I swore at him). "What do you sneer at
      now? You have always one dry rub or another to give us."
    
    
      "Nay," says he, "it is plain enough the ship stood off to sea due east, on
      purpose to lose us, and thou mayest be sure her business does not lie that
      way; for what should she do at the coast of Africa in this latitude, which
      should be as far south as Congo or Angola? But as soon as it is dark, that
      we would lose sight of her, she will tack and stand away west again for
      the Brazil coast and for the bay, where thou knowest she was going before;
      and are we not, then, running away from her? I am greatly in hopes,
      friend," says the dry, gibing creature, "thou wilt turn Quaker, for I see
      thou art not for fighting."
    
    
      "Very well, William," says I; "then I shall make an excellent pirate."
      However, William was in the right, and I apprehended what he meant
      immediately; and Captain Wilmot, who lay very sick in his cabin,
      overhearing us, understood him as well as I, and called out to me that
      William was right, and it was our best way to change our course, and stand
      away for the bay, where it was ten to one but we should snap her in the
      morning.
    
    
      Accordingly we went about-ship, got our larboard tacks on board, set the
      top-gallant sails, and crowded for the bay of All Saints, where we came to
      an anchor early in the morning, just out of gunshot of the forts; we
      furled our sails with rope-yarns, that we might haul home the sheets
      without going up to loose them, and, lowering our main and fore-yards,
      looked just as if we had lain there a good while.
    
    
      In two hours afterwards we saw our game standing in for the bay with all
      the sail she could make, and she came innocently into our very mouths, for
      we lay still till we saw her almost within gunshot, when, our foremost
      gears being stretched fore and aft, we first ran up our yards, and then
      hauled home the topsail sheets, the rope-yarns that furled them giving way
      of themselves; the sails were set in a few minutes; at the same time
      slipping our cable, we came upon her before she could get under way upon
      the other tack. They were so surprised that they made little or no
      resistance, but struck after the first broadside.
    
    
      We were considering what to do with her, when William came to me. "Hark
      thee, friend," says he, "thou hast made a fine piece of work of it now,
      hast thou not, to borrow thy neighbour's ship here just at thy neighbour's
      door, and never ask him leave? Now, dost thou not think there are some
      men-of-war in the port? Thou hast given them the alarm sufficiently; thou
      wilt have them upon thy back before night, depend upon it, to ask thee
      wherefore thou didst so."
    
    
      "Truly, William," said I, "for aught I know, that may be true; what, then,
      shall we do next?" Says he, "Thou hast but two things to do: either to go
      in and take all the rest, or else get thee gone before they come out and
      take thee; for I see they are hoisting a topmast to yon great ship, in
      order to put to sea immediately, and they won't be long before they come
      to talk with thee, and what wilt thou say to them when they ask thee why
      thou borrowedst their ship without leave?"
    
    
      As William said, so it was. We could see by our glasses they were all in a
      hurry, manning and fitting some sloops they had there, and a large
      man-of-war, and it was plain they would soon be with us. But we were not
      at a loss what to do; we found the ship we had taken was laden with
      nothing considerable for our purpose, except some cocoa, some sugar, and
      twenty barrels of flour; the rest of her cargo was hides; so we took out
      all we thought fit for our turn, and, among the rest, all her ammunition,
      great shot, and small-arms, and turned her off. We also took a cable and
      three anchors she had, which were for our purpose, and some of her sails.
      She had enough left just to carry her into port, and that was all.
    
    
      Having done this, we stood on upon the Brazil coast, southward, till we
      came to the mouth of the river Janeiro. But as we had two days the wind
      blowing hard at S.E. and S.S.E., we were obliged to come to an anchor
      under a little island, and wait for a wind. In this time the Portuguese
      had, it seems, given notice over land to the governor there, that a pirate
      was upon the coast; so that, when we came in view of the port, we saw two
      men-of-war riding just without the bar, whereof one, we found, was getting
      under sail with all possible speed, having slipped her cable on purpose to
      speak with us; the other was not so forward, but was preparing to follow.
      In less than an hour they stood both fair after us, with all the sail they
      could make.
    
    
      Had not the night come on, William's words had been made good; they would
      certainly have asked us the question what we did there, for we found the
      foremost ship gained upon us, especially upon one tack, for we plied away
      from them to windward; but in the dark losing sight of them, we resolved
      to change our course and stand away directly for sea, not doubting that we
      should lose them in the night.
    
    
      Whether the Portuguese commander guessed we would do so or no, I know not;
      but in the morning, when the daylight appeared, instead of having lost
      him, we found him in chase of us about a league astern; only, to our great
      good fortune, we could see but one of the two. However, this one was a
      great ship, carried six-and-forty guns, and an admirable sailer, as
      appeared by her outsailing us; for our ship was an excellent sailer too,
      as I have said before.
    
    
      When I found this, I easily saw there was no remedy, but we must engage;
      and as we knew we could expect no quarter from those scoundrels the
      Portuguese, a nation I had an original aversion to, I let Captain Wilmot
      know how it was. The captain, sick as he was, jumped up in the cabin, and
      would be led out upon the deck (for he was very weak) to see how it was.
      "Well," says he, "we'll fight them!"
    
    
      Our men were all in good heart before, but to see the captain so brisk,
      who had lain ill of a calenture ten or eleven days, gave them double
      courage, and they went all hands to work to make a clear ship and be
      ready. William, the Quaker, comes to me with a kind of a smile. "Friend,"
      says he, "what does yon ship follow us for?" "Why," says I, "to fight us,
      you may be sure." "Well," says he, "and will he come up with us, dost thou
      think?" "Yes," said I, "you see she will." "Why, then, friend," says the
      dry wretch, "why dost thou run from her still, when thou seest she will
      overtake thee? Will it be better for us to be overtaken farther off than
      here?" "Much as one for that," says I; "why, what would you have us do?"
      "Do!" says he; "let us not give the poor man more trouble than needs must;
      let us stay for him and hear what he has to say to us." "He will talk to
      us in powder and ball," said I. "Very well, then," says he, "if that be
      his country language, we must talk to him in the same, must we not? or
      else how shall he understand us?" "Very well, William," says I, "we
      understand you." And the captain, as ill as he was, called to me,
      "William's right again," says he; "as good here as a league farther." So
      he gives a word of command, "Haul up the main-sail; we'll shorten sail for
      him."
    
    
      Accordingly we shortened sail, and as we expected her upon our lee-side,
      we being then upon our starboard tack, brought eighteen of our guns to the
      larboard side, resolving to give him a broadside that should warm him. It
      was about half-an-hour before he came up with us, all which time we luffed
      up, that we might keep the wind of him, by which he was obliged to run up
      under our lee, as we designed him; when we got him upon our quarter, we
      edged down, and received the fire of five or six of his guns. By this time
      you may be sure all our hands were at their quarters, so we clapped our
      helm hard a-weather, let go the lee-braces of the maintop sail, and laid
      it a-back, and so our ship fell athwart the Portuguese ship's hawse; then
      we immediately poured in our broadside, raking them fore and aft, and
      killed them a great many men.
    
    
      The Portuguese, we could see, were in the utmost confusion; and not being
      aware of our design, their ship having fresh way, ran their bowsprit into
      the fore part of our main shrouds, as that they could not easily get clear
      of us, and so we lay locked after that manner. The enemy could not bring
      above five or six guns, besides their small-arms, to bear upon us, while
      we played our whole broadside upon him.
    
    
      In the middle of the heat of this fight, as I was very busy upon the
      quarter-deck, the captain calls to me, for he never stirred from us, "What
      the devil is friend William a-doing yonder?" says the captain; "has he any
      business upon, deck?" I stepped forward, and there was friend William,
      with two or three stout fellows, lashing the ship's bowsprit fast to our
      mainmast, for fear they should get away from us; and every now and then he
      pulled a bottle out of his pocket, and gave the men a dram to encourage
      them. The shot flew about his ears as thick as may be supposed in such an
      action, where the Portuguese, to give them their due, fought very briskly,
      believing at first they were sure of their game, and trusting to their
      superiority; but there was William, as composed, and in as perfect
      tranquillity as to danger, as if he had been over a bowl of punch, only
      very busy securing the matter, that a ship of forty-six guns should not
      run away from a ship of eight-and-twenty.
    
    
      This work was too hot to hold long; our men behaved bravely: our gunner, a
      gallant man, shouted below, pouring in his shot at such a rate, that the
      Portuguese began to slacken their fire; we had dismounted several of their
      guns by firing in at their forecastle, and raking them, as I said, fore
      and aft. Presently comes William up to me. "Friend," says he, very calmly,
      "what dost thou mean? Why dost thou not visit thy neighbour in the ship,
      the door being open for thee?" I understood him immediately, for our guns
      had so torn their hull, that we had beat two port-holes into one, and the
      bulk-head of their steerage was split to pieces, so that they could not
      retire to their close quarters; so I gave the word immediately to board
      them. Our second lieutenant, with about thirty men, entered in an instant
      over the forecastle, followed by some more with the boatswain, and cutting
      in pieces about twenty-five men that they found upon the deck, and then
      throwing some grenadoes into the steerage, they entered there also; upon
      which the Portuguese cried quarter presently, and we mastered the ship,
      contrary indeed to our own expectation; for we would have compounded with
      them if they would have sheered off: but laying them athwart the hawse at
      first, and following our fire furiously, without giving them any time to
      get clear of us and work their ship; by this means, though they had
      six-and-forty guns, they were not able to fight above five or six, as I
      said above, for we beat them immediately from their guns in the
      forecastle, and killed them abundance of men between decks, so that when
      we entered they had hardly found men enough to fight us hand to hand upon
      their deck.
    
    
      The surprise of joy to hear the Portuguese cry quarter, and see their
      ancient struck, was so great to our captain, who, as I have said, was
      reduced very weak with a high fever, that it gave him new life. Nature
      conquered the distemper, and the fever abated that very night; so that in
      two or three days he was sensibly better, his strength began to come, and
      he was able to give his orders effectually in everything that was
      material, and in about ten days was entirely well and about the ship.
    
    
      In the meantime I took possession of the Portuguese man-of-war; and
      Captain Wilmot made me, or rather I made myself, captain of her for the
      present. About thirty of their seamen took service with us, some of which
      were French, some Genoese; and we set the rest on shore the next day on a
      little island on the coast of Brazil, except some wounded men, who were
      not in a condition to be removed, and whom we were bound to keep on board;
      but we had an occasion afterwards to dispose of them at the Cape, where,
      at their own request, we set them on shore.
    
    
      Captain Wilmot, as soon as the ship was taken, and the prisoners stowed,
      was for standing in for the river Janeiro again, not doubting but we
      should meet with the other man-of-war, who, not having been able to find
      us, and having lost the company of her comrade, would certainly be
      returned, and might be surprised by the ship we had taken, if we carried
      Portuguese colours; and our men were all for it.
    
    
      But our friend William gave us better counsel, for he came to me,
      "Friend," says he, "I understand the captain is for sailing back to the
      Rio Janeiro, in hopes to meet with the other ship that was in chase of
      thee yesterday. Is it true, dost thou intend it?" "Why, yes," says I,
      "William, pray why not?" "Nay," says he, "thou mayest do so if thou wilt."
      "Well, I know that too, William," said I, "but the captain is a man will
      be ruled by reason; what have you to say to it?" "Why," says William
      gravely, "I only ask what is thy business, and the business of all the
      people thou hast with thee? Is it not to get money?" "Yes, William, it is
      so, in our honest way." "And wouldest thou," says he, "rather have money
      without fighting, or fighting without money? I mean which wouldest thou
      have by choice, suppose it to be left to thee?" "O William," says I, "the
      first of the two, to be sure." "Why, then," says he, "what great gain hast
      thou made of the prize thou hast taken now, though it has cost the lives
      of thirteen of thy men, besides some hurt? It is true thou hast got the
      ship and some prisoners; but thou wouldest have had twice the booty in a
      merchant-ship, with not one quarter of the fighting; and how dost thou
      know either what force or what number of men may be in the other ship, and
      what loss thou mayest suffer, and what gain it shall be to thee if thou
      take her? I think, indeed, thou mayest much better let her alone."
    
    
      "Why, William, it is true," said I, "and I'll go tell the captain what
      your opinion is, and bring you word what he says." Accordingly in I went
      to the captain and told him William's reasons; and the captain was of his
      mind, that our business was indeed fighting when we could not help it, but
      that our main affair was money, and that with as few blows as we could. So
      that adventure was laid aside, and we stood along shore again south for
      the river De la Plata, expecting some purchase thereabouts; especially we
      had our eyes upon some of the Spanish ships from Buenos Ayres, which are
      generally very rich in silver, and one such prize would have done our
      business. We plied about here, in the latitude of                south,
      for near a month, and nothing offered; and here we began to consult what
      we should do next, for we had come to no resolution yet. Indeed, my design
      was always for the Cape de Bona Speranza, and so to the East Indies. I had
      heard some flaming stories of Captain Avery, and the fine things he had
      done in the Indies, which were doubled and doubled, even ten thousand
      fold; and from taking a great prize in the Bay of Bengal, where he took a
      lady, said to be the Great Mogul's daughter, with a great quantity of
      jewels about her, we had a story told us, that he took a Mogul ship, so
      the foolish sailors called it, laden with diamonds.
    
    
      I would fain have had friend William's advice whither we should go, but he
      always put it off with some quaking quibble or other. In short, he did not
      care for directing us neither; whether he made a piece of conscience of
      it, or whether he did not care to venture having it come against him
      afterwards or no, this I know not; but we concluded at last without him.
    
    
      We were, however, pretty long in resolving, and hankered about the Rio de
      la Plata a long time. At last we spied a sail to windward, and it was such
      a sail as I believe had not been seen in that part of the world a great
      while. It wanted not that we should give it chase, for it stood directly
      towards us, as well as they that steered could make it; and even that was
      more accident of weather than anything else, for if the wind had chopped
      about anywhere they must have gone with it. I leave any man that is a
      sailor, or understands anything of a ship, to judge what a figure this
      ship made when we first saw her, and what we could imagine was the matter
      with her. Her maintop-mast was come by the board about six foot above the
      cap, and fell forward, the head of the topgallant-mast hanging in the
      fore-shrouds by the stay; at the same time the parrel of the
      mizzen-topsail-yard by some accident giving way, the mizzen-topsail-braces
      (the standing part of which being fast to the main-topsail shrouds)
      brought the mizzen-topsail, yard and all, down with it, which spread over
      part of the quarter-deck like an awning; the fore-topsail was hoisted up
      two-thirds of the mast, but the sheets were flown; the fore-yard was
      lowered down upon the forecastle, the sail loose, and part of it hanging
      overboard. In this manner she came down upon us with the wind quartering.
      In a word, the figure the whole ship made was the most confounding to men
      that understood the sea that ever was seen. She had no boat, neither had
      she any colours out.
    
    
      When we came near to her, we fired a gun to bring her to. She took no
      notice of it, nor of us, but came on just as she did before. We fired
      again, but it was all one. At length we came within pistol-shot of one
      another, but nobody answered nor appeared; so we began to think that it
      was a ship gone ashore somewhere in distress, and the men having forsaken
      her, the high tide had floated her off to sea. Coming nearer to her, we
      ran up alongside of her so close that we could hear a noise within her,
      and see the motion of several people through her ports.
    
    
      Upon this we manned out two boats full of men, and very well armed, and
      ordered them to board her at the same minute, as near as they could, and
      to enter one at her fore-chains on the one side, and the other amidships
      on the other side. As soon as they came to the ship's side, a surprising
      multitude of black sailors, such as they were, appeared upon deck, and, in
      short, terrified our men so much that the boat which was to enter her men
      in the waist stood off again, and durst not board her; and the men that
      entered out of the other boat, finding the first boat, as they thought,
      beaten off, and seeing the ship full of men, jumped all back again into
      their boat, and put off, not knowing what the matter was. Upon this we
      prepared to pour in a broadside upon her; but our friend William set us to
      rights again here; for it seems he guessed how it was sooner than we did,
      and coming up to me (for it was our ship that came up with her), "Friend,"
      says he, "I am of opinion that thou art wrong in this matter, and thy men
      have been wrong also in their conduct. I'll tell thee how thou shalt take
      this ship, without making use of those things called guns." "How can that
      be, William?" said I. "Why," said he, "thou mayest take her with thy helm;
      thou seest they keep no steerage, and thou seest the condition they are
      in; board her with thy ship upon her lee quarter, and so enter her from
      the ship. I am persuaded thou wilt take her without fighting, for there is
      some mischief has befallen the ship, which we know nothing of."
    
    
      In a word, it being a smooth sea, and little wind, I took his advice, and
      laid her aboard. Immediately our men entered the ship, where we found a
      large ship, with upwards of 600 negroes, men and women, boys and girls,
      and not one Christian or white man on board.
    
    
      I was struck with horror at the sight; for immediately I concluded, as was
      partly the case, that these black devils had got loose, had murdered all
      the white men, and thrown them into the sea; and I had no sooner told my
      mind to the men, but the thought so enraged them that I had much ado to
      keep my men from cutting them all in pieces. But William, with many
      persuasions, prevailed upon them, by telling them that it was nothing but
      what, if they were in the negroes' condition, they would do if they could;
      and that the negroes had really the highest injustice done them, to be
      sold for slaves without their consent; and that the law of nature dictated
      it to them; that they ought not to kill them, and that it would be wilful
      murder to do it.
    
    
      This prevailed with them, and cooled their first heat; so they only
      knocked down twenty or thirty of them, and the rest ran all down between
      decks to their first places, believing, as we fancied, that we were their
      first masters come again.
    
    
      It was a most unaccountable difficulty we had next; for we could not make
      them understand one word we said, nor could we understand one word
      ourselves that they said. We endeavoured by signs to ask them whence they
      came; but they could make nothing of it. We pointed to the great cabin, to
      the round-house, to the cook-room, then to our faces, to ask if they had
      no white men on board, and where they were gone; but they could not
      understand what we meant. On the other hand, they pointed to our boat and
      to their ship, asking questions as well as they could, and said a thousand
      things, and expressed themselves with great earnestness; but we could not
      understand a word of it all, or know what they meant by any of their
      signs.
    
    
      We knew very well they must have been taken on board the ship as slaves,
      and that it must be by some European people too. We could easily see that
      the ship was a Dutch-built ship, but very much altered, having been built
      upon, and, as we supposed, in France; for we found two or three French
      books on board, and afterwards we found clothes, linen, lace, some old
      shoes, and several other things. We found among the provisions some
      barrels of Irish beef, some Newfoundland fish, and several other evidences
      that there had been Christians on board, but saw no remains of them. We
      found not a sword, gun, pistol, or weapon of any kind, except some
      cutlasses; and the negroes had hid them below where they lay. We asked
      them what was become of all the small-arms, pointing to our own and to the
      places where those belonging to the ship had hung. One of the negroes
      understood me presently, and beckoned to me to come upon the deck, where,
      taking my fuzee, which I never let go out of my hand for some time after
      we had mastered the ship       I say, offering to take hold of it, he made
      the proper motion of throwing it into the sea; by which I understood, as I
      did afterwards, that they had thrown all the small-arms, powder, shot,
      swords,      c., into the sea, believing, as I supposed, those things
      would kill them, though the men were gone.
    
    
      After we understood this we made no question but that the ship's crew,
      having been surprised by these desperate rogues, had gone the same way,
      and had been thrown overboard also. We looked all over the ship to see if
      we could find any blood, and we thought we did perceive some in several
      places; but the heat of the sun, melting the pitch and tar upon the decks,
      made it impossible for us to discern it exactly, except in the
      round-house, where we plainly saw that there had been much blood. We found
      the scuttle open, by which we supposed that the captain and those that
      were with him had made their retreat into the great cabin, or those in the
      cabin had made their escape up into the round-house.
    
    
      But that which confirmed us most of all in what had happened was that,
      upon further inquiry, we found that there were seven or eight of the
      negroes very much wounded, two or three of them with shot, whereof one had
      his leg broken and lay in a miserable condition, the flesh being
      mortified, and, as our friend William said, in two days more he would have
      died. William was a most dexterous surgeon, and he showed it in this cure;
      for though all the surgeons we had on board both our ships (and we had no
      less than five that called themselves bred surgeons, besides two or three
      who were pretenders or assistants)       though all these gave their
      opinions that the negro's leg must be cut off, and that his life could not
      be saved without it; that the mortification had touched the marrow in the
      bone, that the tendons were mortified, and that he could never have the
      use of his leg if it should be cured, William said nothing in general, but
      that his opinion was otherwise, and that he desired the wound might be
      searched, and that he would then tell them further. Accordingly he went to
      work with the leg; and, as he desired that he might have some of the
      surgeons to assist him, we appointed him two of the ablest of them to
      help, and all of them to look on, if they thought fit.
    
    
      William went to work his own way, and some of them pretended to find fault
      at first. However, he proceeded and searched every part of the leg where
      he suspected the mortification had touched it; in a word, he cut off a
      great deal of mortified flesh, in all which the poor fellow felt no pain.
      William proceeded till he brought the vessels which he had cut to bleed,
      and the man to cry out; then he reduced the splinters of the bone, and,
      calling for help, set it, as we call it, and bound it up, and laid the man
      to rest, who found himself much easier than before.
    
    
      At the first opening the surgeons began to triumph; the mortification
      seemed to spread, and a long red streak of blood appeared from the wound
      upwards to the middle of the man's thigh, and the surgeons told me the man
      would die in a few hours. I went to look at it, and found William himself
      under some surprise; but when I asked him how long he thought the poor
      fellow could live, he looked gravely at me, and said, "As long as thou
      canst; I am not at all apprehensive of his life," said he, "but I would
      cure him, if I could, without making a cripple of him." I found he was not
      just then upon the operation as to his leg, but was mixing up something to
      give the poor creature, to repel, as I thought, the spreading contagion,
      and to abate or prevent any feverish temper that might happen in the
      blood; after which he went to work again, and opened the leg in two places
      above the wound, cutting out a great deal of mortified flesh, which it
      seemed was occasioned by the bandage, which had pressed the parts too
      much; and withal, the blood being at the time in a more than common
      disposition to mortify, might assist to spread it.
    
    
      Well, our friend William conquered all this, cleared the spreading
      mortification, and the red streak went off again, the flesh began to heal,
      and matter to run; and in a few days the man's spirits began to recover,
      his pulse beat regular, he had no fever, and gathered strength daily; and,
      in a word, he was a perfect sound man in about ten weeks, and we kept him
      amongst us, and made him an able seaman. But to return to the ship: we
      never could come at a certain information about it, till some of the
      negroes which we kept on board, and whom we taught to speak English, gave
      the account of it afterwards, and this maimed man in particular.
    
    
      We inquired, by all the signs and motions we could imagine, what was
      become of the people, and yet we could get nothing from them. Our
      lieutenant was for torturing some of them to make them confess, but
      William opposed that vehemently; and when he heard it was under
      consideration he came to me. "Friend," says he, "I make a request to thee
      not to put any of these poor wretches to torment." "Why, William," said I,
      "why not? You see they will not give any account of what is become of the
      white men." "Nay," says William, "do not say so; I suppose they have given
      thee a full account of every particular of it." "How so?" says I; "pray
      what are we the wiser for all their jabbering?" "Nay," says William, "that
      may be thy fault, for aught I know; thou wilt not punish the poor men
      because they cannot speak English; and perhaps they never heard a word of
      English before. Now, I may very well suppose that they have given thee a
      large account of everything; for thou seest with what earnestness, and how
      long, some of them have talked to thee; and if thou canst not understand
      their language, nor they thine, how can they help that? At the best, thou
      dost but suppose that they have not told thee the whole truth of the
      story; and, on the contrary, I suppose they have; and how wilt thou decide
      the question, whether thou art right or whether I am right? Besides, what
      can they say to thee when thou askest them a question upon the torture,
      and at the same time they do not understand the question, and thou dost
      not know whether they say ay or no?"
    
    
      It is no compliment to my moderation to say I was convinced by these
      reasons; and yet we had all much ado to keep our second lieutenant from
      murdering some of them, to make them tell. What if they had told? He did
      not understand one word of it; but he would not be persuaded but that the
      negroes must needs understand him when he asked them whether the ship had
      any boat or no, like ours, and what was become of it.
    
    
      But there was no remedy but to wait till we made these people understand
      English, and to adjourn the story till that time. The case was thus: where
      they were taken on board the ship, that we could never understand, because
      they never knew the English names which we give to those coasts, or what
      nation they were who belonged to the ship, because they knew not one
      tongue from another; but thus far the negro I examined, who was the same
      whose leg William had cured, told us, that they did not speak the same
      language as we spoke, nor the same our Portuguese spoke; so that in all
      probability they must be French or Dutch.
    
    
      Then he told us that the white men used them barbarously; that they beat
      them unmercifully; that one of the negro men had a wife and two negro
      children, one a daughter, about sixteen years old; that a white man abused
      the negro man's wife, and afterwards his daughter, which, as he said, made
      all the negro men mad; and that the woman's husband was in a great rage;
      at which the white man was so provoked that he threatened to kill him;
      but, in the night, the negro man, being loose, got a great club, by which
      he made us understand he meant a handspike, and that when the same
      Frenchman (if it was a Frenchman) came among them again, he began again to
      abuse the negro man's wife, at which the negro, taking up the handspike,
      knocked his brains out at one blow; and then taking the key from him with
      which he usually unlocked the handcuffs which the negroes were fettered
      with, he set about a hundred of them at liberty, who, getting up upon the
      deck by the same scuttle that the white men came down, and taking the
      man's cutlass who was killed, and laying hold of what came next them, they
      fell upon the men that were upon the deck, and killed them all, and
      afterwards those they found upon the forecastle; that the captain and his
      other men, who were in the cabin and the round-house, defended themselves
      with great courage, and shot out at the loopholes at them, by which he and
      several other men were wounded, and some killed; but that they broke into
      the round-house after a long dispute, where they killed two of the white
      men, but owned that the two white men killed eleven of their men before
      they could break in; and then the rest, having got down the scuttle into
      the great cabin, wounded three more of them.
    
    
      That, after this, the gunner of the ship having secured himself in the
      gun-room, one of his men hauled up the long-boat close under the stern,
      and putting into her all the arms and ammunition they could come at, got
      all into the boat, and afterwards took in the captain, and those that were
      with him, out of the great cabin. When they were all thus embarked, they
      resolved to lay the ship aboard again, and try to recover it. That they
      boarded the ship in a desperate manner, and killed at first all that stood
      in their way; but the negroes being by this time all loose, and having
      gotten some arms, though they understood nothing of powder and bullet, or
      guns, yet the men could never master them. However, they lay under the
      ship's bow, and got out all the men they had left in the cook-room, who
      had maintained themselves there, notwithstanding all the negroes could do,
      and with their small-arms killed between thirty and forty of the negroes,
      but were at last forced to leave them.
    
    
      They could give me no account whereabouts this was, whether near the coast
      of Africa, or far off, or how long it was before the ship fell into our
      hands; only, in general, it was a great while ago, as they called it; and,
      by all we could learn, it was within two or three days after they had set
      sail from the coast. They told us that they had killed about thirty of the
      white men, having knocked them on the head with crows and handspikes, and
      such things as they could get; and one strong negro killed three of them
      with an iron crow, after he was shot twice through the body; and that he
      was afterwards shot through the head by the captain himself at the door of
      the round-house, which he had split open with the crow; and this we
      supposed was the occasion of the great quantity of blood which we saw at
      the round-house door.
    
    
      The same negro told us that they threw all the powder and shot they could
      find into the sea, and they would have thrown the great guns into the sea
      if they could have lifted them. Being asked how they came to have their
      sails in such a condition, his answer was, "They no understand; they no
      know what the sails do;" that was, they did not so much as know that it
      was the sails that made the ship go, or understand what they meant, or
      what to do with them. When we asked him whither they were going, he said
      they did not know, but believed they should go home to their own country
      again. I asked him, in particular, what he thought we were when we first
      came up with them? He said they were terribly frighted, believing we were
      the same white men that had gone away in their boats, and were come again
      in a great ship, with the two boats with them, and expected they would
      kill them all.
    
    
      This was the account we got out of them, after we had taught them to speak
      English, and to understand the names and use of the things belonging to
      the ship which they had occasion to speak of; and we observed that the
      fellows were too innocent to dissemble in their relation, and that they
      all agreed in the particulars, and were always in the same story, which
      confirmed very much the truth of what they said.
    
    
      Having taken this ship, our next difficulty was, what to do with the
      negroes. The Portuguese in the Brazils would have bought them all of us,
      and been glad of the purchase, if we had not showed ourselves enemies
      there, and been known for pirates; but, as it was, we durst not go ashore
      anywhere thereabouts, or treat with any of the planters, because we should
      raise the whole country upon us; and, if there were any such things as
      men-of-war in any of their ports, we should be as sure to be attacked by
      them, and by all the force they had by land or sea.
    
    
      Nor could we think of any better success if we went northward to our own
      plantations. One while we determined to carry them all away to Buenos
      Ayres, and sell them there to the Spaniards; but they were really too many
      for them to make use of; and to carry them round to the South Seas, which
      was the only remedy that was left, was so far that we should be no way
      able to subsist them for so long a voyage.
    
    
      At last, our old, never-failing friend, William, helped us out again, as
      he had often done at a dead lift. His proposal was this, that he should go
      as master of the ship, and about twenty men, such as we could best trust,
      and attempt to trade privately, upon the coast of Brazil, with the
      planters, not at the principal ports, because that would not be admitted.
    
    
      We all agreed to this, and appointed to go away ourselves towards the Rio
      de la Plata, where we had thought of going before, and to wait for him,
      not there, but at Port St Pedro, as the Spaniards call it, lying at the
      mouth of the river which they call Rio Grande, and where the Spaniards had
      a small fort and a few people, but we believe there was nobody in it.
    
    
      Here we took up our station, cruising off and on, to see if we could meet
      any ships going to or coming from the Buenos Ayres or the Rio de la Plata;
      but we met with nothing worth notice. However, we employed ourselves in
      things necessary for our going off to sea; for we filled all our
      water-casks, and got some fish for our present use, to spare as much as
      possible our ship's stores.
    
    
      William, in the meantime, went away to the north, and made the land about
      the Cape de St Thomas; and betwixt that and the isles De Tuberon he found
      means to trade with the planters for all his negroes, as well the women as
      the men, and at a very good price too; for William, who spoke Portuguese
      pretty well, told them a fair story enough, that the ship was in scarcity
      of provisions, that they were driven a great way out of their way, and
      indeed, as we say, out of their knowledge, and that they must go up to the
      northward as far as Jamaica, or sell there upon the coast. This was a very
      plausible tale, and was easily believed; and, if you observe the manner of
      the negroes' sailing, and what happened in their voyage, was every word of
      it true.
    
    
      By this method, and being true to one another, William passed for what he
      was       I mean, for a very honest fellow; and by the assistance of one
      planter, who sent to some of his neighbour planters, and managed the trade
      among themselves, he got a quick market; for in less than five weeks
      William sold all his negroes, and at last sold the ship itself, and
      shipped himself and his twenty men, with two negro boys whom he had left,
      in a sloop, one of those which the planters used to send on board for the
      negroes. With this sloop Captain William, as we then called him, came
      away, and found us at Port St Pedro, in the latitude of 32 degrees 30
      minutes south.
    
    
      Nothing was more surprising to us than to see a sloop come along the
      coast, carrying Portuguese colours, and come in directly to us, after we
      were assured he had discovered both our ships. We fired a gun, upon her
      nearer approach, to bring her to an anchor, but immediately she fired five
      guns by way of salute, and spread her English ancient. Then we began to
      guess it was friend William, but wondered what was the meaning of his
      being in a sloop, whereas we sent him away in a ship of near 300 tons; but
      he soon let us into the whole history of his management, with which we had
      a great deal of reason to be very well satisfied. As soon as he had
      brought the sloop to an anchor, he came aboard of my ship, and there he
      gave us an account how he began to trade by the help of a Portuguese
      planter, who lived near the seaside; how he went on shore and went up to
      the first house he could see, and asked the man of the house to sell him
      some hogs, pretending at first he only stood in upon the coast to take in
      fresh water and buy some provisions; and the man not only sold him seven
      fat hogs, but invited him in, and gave him, and five men he had with him,
      a very good dinner; and he invited the planter on board his ship, and, in
      return for his kindness, gave him a negro girl for his wife.
    
    
      This so obliged the planter that the next morning he sent him on board, in
      a great luggage-boat, a cow and two sheep, with a chest of sweetmeats and
      some sugar, and a great bag of tobacco, and invited Captain William on
      shore again; that, after this, they grew from one kindness to another;
      that they began to talk about trading for some negroes; and William,
      pretending it was to do him service, consented to sell him thirty negroes
      for his private use in his plantation, for which he gave William ready
      money in gold, at the rate of five-and-thirty moidores per head; but the
      planter was obliged to use great caution in the bringing them on shore;
      for which purpose he made William weigh and stand out to sea, and put in
      again, about fifty miles farther north, where at a little creek he took
      the negroes on shore at another plantation, being a friend's of his, whom,
      it seems, he could trust.
    
    
      This remove brought William into a further intimacy, not only with the
      first planter, but also with his friends, who desired to have some of the
      negroes also; so that, from one to another, they bought so many, till one
      overgrown planter took 100 negroes, which was all William had left, and
      sharing them with another planter, that other planter chaffered with
      William for ship and all, giving him in exchange a very clean, large,
      well-built sloop of near sixty tons, very well furnished, carrying six
      guns; but we made her afterwards carry twelve guns. William had 300
      moidores of gold, besides the sloop, in payment for the ship; and with
      this money he stored the sloop as full as she could hold with provisions,
      especially bread, some pork, and about sixty hogs alive; among the rest,
      William got eighty barrels of good gunpowder, which was very much for our
      purpose; and all the provisions which were in the French ship he took out
      also.
    
    
      This was a very agreeable account to us, especially when we saw that
      William had received in gold coined, or by weight, and some Spanish
      silver, 60,000 pieces of eight, besides a new sloop, and a vast quantity
      of provisions.
    
    
      We were very glad of the sloop in particular, and began to consult what we
      should do, whether we had not best turn off our great Portuguese ship, and
      stick to our first ship and the sloop, seeing we had scarce men enough for
      all three, and that the biggest ship was thought too big for our business.
      However, another dispute, which was now decided, brought the first to a
      conclusion. The first dispute was, whither we should go. My comrade, as I
      called him now, that is to say, he that was my captain before we took this
      Portuguese man-of-war, was for going to the South Seas, and coasting up
      the west side of America, where we could not fail of making several good
      prizes upon the Spaniards; and that then, if occasion required it, we
      might come home by the South Seas to the East Indies, and so go round the
      globe, as others had done before us.
    
    
      But my head lay another way. I had been in the East Indies, and had
      entertained a notion ever since that, if we went thither, we could not
      fail of making good work of it, and that we might have a safe retreat, and
      good beef to victual our ship, among my old friends the natives of
      Zanzibar, on the coast of Mozambique, or the island of St Lawrence. I say,
      my thoughts lay this way; and I read so many lectures to them all of the
      advantages they would certainly make of their strength by the prizes they
      would take in the Gulf of Mocha, or the Red Sea, and on the coast of
      Malabar, or the Bay of Bengal, that I amazed them.
    
    
      With these arguments I prevailed on them, and we all resolved to steer
      away S.E. for the Cape of Good Hope; and, in consequence of this
      resolution, we concluded to keep the sloop, and sail with all three, not
      doubting, as I assured them, but we should find men there to make up the
      number wanting, and if not, we might cast any of them off when we pleased.
    
    
      We could do no less than make our friend William captain of the sloop
      which, with such good management, he had brought us. He told us, though
      with much good manners, he would not command her as a frigate; but, if we
      would give her to him for his share of the Guinea ship, which we came very
      honestly by, he would keep us company as a victualler, if we commanded
      him, as long as he was under the same force that took him away.
    
    
      We understood him, so gave him the sloop, but upon condition that he
      should not go from us, and should be entirely under our command. However,
      William was not so easy as before; and, indeed, as we afterwards wanted
      the sloop to cruise for purchase, and a right thorough-paced pirate in
      her, so I was in such pain for William that I could not be without him,
      for he was my privy counsellor and companion upon all occasions; so I put
      a Scotsman, a bold, enterprising, gallant fellow, into her, named Gordon,
      and made her carry twelve guns and four petereroes, though, indeed, we
      wanted men, for we were none of us manned in proportion to our force.
    
    
      We sailed away for the Cape of Good Hope the beginning of October 1706,
      and passed by, in sight of the Cape, the 12th of November following,
      having met with a great deal of bad weather. We saw several merchant-ships
      in the roads there, as well English as Dutch, whether outward bound or
      homeward we could not tell; be it what it would, we did not think fit to
      come to an anchor, not knowing what they might be, or what they might
      attempt against us, when they knew what we were. However, as we wanted
      fresh water, we sent the two boats belonging to the Portuguese man-of-war,
      with all Portuguese seamen or negroes in them, to the watering-place, to
      take in water; and in the meantime we hung out a Portuguese ancient at
      sea, and lay by all that night. They knew not what we were, but it seems
      we passed for anything but really what we was.
    
    
      Our boats returning the third time loaden, about five o'clock next
      morning, we thought ourselves sufficiently watered, and stood away to the
      eastward; but, before our men returned the last time, the wind blowing an
      easy gale at west, we perceived a boat in the grey of the morning under
      sail, crowding to come up with us, as if they were afraid we should be
      gone. We soon found it was an English long-boat, and that it was pretty
      full of men. We could not imagine what the meaning of it should be; but,
      as it was but a boat, we thought there could be no great harm in it to let
      them come on board; and if it appeared they came only to inquire who we
      were, we would give them a full account of our business, by taking them
      along with us, seeing we wanted men as much as anything. But they saved us
      the labour of being in doubt how to dispose of them; for it seems our
      Portuguese seamen, who went for water, had not been so silent at the
      watering-places as we thought they would have been. But the case, in
      short, was this: Captain                (I forbear his name at present,
      for a particular reason), captain of an East India merchant-ship, bound
      afterwards for China, had found some reason to be very severe with his
      men, and had handled some of them very roughly at St Helena; insomuch,
      that they threatened among themselves to leave the ship the first
      opportunity, and had long wished for that opportunity. Some of these men,
      it seems, had met with our boat at the watering-place, and inquiring of
      one another who we were, and upon what account, whether the Portuguese
      seamen, by faltering in their account, made them suspect that we were out
      upon the cruise, or whether they told it in plain English or no (for they
      all spoke English enough to be understood), but so it was, that as soon as
      ever the men carried the news on board, that the ships which lay by to the
      eastward were English, and that they were going upon the account,
      which, by they way, was a sea term for a pirate; I say, as soon as ever
      they heard it, they went to work, and getting all things ready in the
      night, their chests and clothes, and whatever else they could, they came
      away before it was day, and came up with us about seven o'clock.
    
    
      When they came by the ship's side which I commanded we hailed them in the
      usual manner, to know what and who they were, and what their business.
      They answered they were Englishmen, and desired to come on board. We told
      them they might lay the ship on board, but ordered they should let only
      one man enter the ship till the captain knew their business, and that he
      should come without any arms. They said, Ay, with all their hearts.
    
    
      We presently found their business, and that they desired to go with us;
      and as for their arms, they desired we would send men on board the boat,
      and that they would deliver them all to us, which was done. The fellow
      that came up to me told me how they had been used by their captain, how he
      had starved the men, and used them like dogs, and that, if the rest of the
      men knew they should be admitted, he was satisfied two-thirds of them
      would leave the ship. We found the fellows were very hearty in their
      resolution, and jolly brisk sailors they were; so I told them I would do
      nothing without our admiral, that was the captain of the other ship; so I
      sent my pinnace on board Captain Wilmot, to desire him to come on board.
      But he was indisposed, and being to leeward, excused his coming, but left
      it all to me; but before my boat was returned, Captain Wilmot called to me
      by his speaking-trumpet, which all the men might hear as well as I; thus,
      calling me by my name, "I hear they are honest fellows; pray tell them
      they are all welcome, and make them a bowl of punch."
    
    
      As the men heard it as well as I, there was no need to tell them what the
      captain said; and, as soon as the trumpet had done, they set up a huzza,
      that showed us they were very hearty in their coming to us; but we bound
      them to us by a stronger obligation still after this, for when we came to
      Madagascar, Captain Wilmot, with consent of all the ship's company,
      ordered that these men should have as much money given them out of the
      stock as was due to them for their pay in the ship they had left; and
      after that we allowed them twenty pieces of eight a man bounty money; and
      thus we entered them upon shares, as we were all, and brave stout fellows
      they were, being eighteen in number, whereof two were midshipmen, and one
      a carpenter.
    
    
      It was the 28th of November, when, having had some bad weather, we came to
      an anchor in the road off St Augustine Bay, at the south-west end of my
      old acquaintance the isle of Madagascar. We lay here awhile and trafficked
      with the natives for some good beef; though the weather was so hot that we
      could not promise ourselves to salt any of it up to keep; but I showed
      them the way which we practised before, to salt it first with saltpetre,
      then cure it by drying it in the sun, which made it eat very agreeably,
      though not so wholesome for our men, that not agreeing with our way of
      cooking, viz., boiling with pudding, brewis,      c., and particularly
      this way, would be too salt, and the fat of the meat be rusty, or dried
      away so as not to be eaten.
    
    
      This, however, we could not help, and made ourselves amends by feeding
      heartily on the fresh beef while we were there, which was excellent, good
      and fat, every way as tender and as well relished as in England, and
      thought to be much better to us who had not tasted any in England for so
      long a time.
    
    
      Having now for some time remained here, we began to consider that this was
      not a place for our business; and I, that had some views a particular way
      of my own, told them that this was not a station for those who looked for
      purchase; that there were two parts of the island which were particularly
      proper for our purposes; first, the bay on the east side of the island,
      and from thence to the island Mauritius, which was the usual way which
      ships that came from the Malabar coast, or the coast of Coromandel, Fort
      St George,      c., used to take, and where, if we waited for them, we
      ought to take our station.
    
    
      But, on the other hand, as we did not resolve to fall upon the European
      traders, who were generally ships of force and well manned, and where
      blows must be looked for; so I had another prospect, which I promised
      myself would yield equal profit, or perhaps greater, without any of the
      hazard and difficulty of the former; and this was the Gulf of Mocha, or
      the Red Sea.
    
    
      I told them that the trade here was great, the ships rich, and the Strait
      of Babelmandel narrow; so that there was no doubt but we might cruise so
      as to let nothing slip our hands, having the seas open from the Red Sea,
      along the coast of Arabia, to the Persian Gulf, and the Malabar side of
      the Indies.
    
    
      I told them what I had observed when I sailed round the island in my
      former progress; how that, on the northernmost point of the island, there
      were several very good harbours and roads for our ships; that the natives
      were even more civil and tractable, if possible, than those where we were,
      not having been so often ill-treated by European sailors as those had in
      the south and east sides; and that we might always be sure of a retreat,
      if we were driven to put in by any necessity, either of enemies or
      weather.
    
    
      They were easily convinced of the reasonableness of my scheme; and Captain
      Wilmot, whom I now called our admiral, though he was at first of the mind
      to go and lie at the island Mauritius, and wait for some of the European
      merchant-ships from the road of Coromandel, or the Bay of Bengal, was now
      of my mind. It is true we were strong enough to have attacked an English
      East India ship of the greatest force, though some of them were said to
      carry fifty guns; but I represented to him that we were sure to have blows
      and blood if we took them; and, after we had done, their loading was not
      of equal value to us, because we had no room to dispose of their
      merchandise; and, as our circumstances stood, we had rather have taken one
      outward-bound East India ship, with her ready cash on board, perhaps to
      the value of forty or fifty thousand pounds, than three homeward-bound,
      though their loading would at London be worth three times the money,
      because we knew not whither to go to dispose of the cargo; whereas the
      ships from London had abundance of things we knew how to make use of
      besides their money, such as their stores of provisions and liquors, and
      great quantities of the like sent to the governors and factories at the
      English settlements for their use; so that, if we resolved to look for our
      own country ships, it should be those that were outward-bound, not the
      London ships homeward.
    
    
      All these things considered, brought the admiral to be of my mind
      entirely; so, after taking in water and some fresh provisions where we
      lay, which was near Cape St Mary, on the south-west corner of the island,
      we weighed and stood away south, and afterwards S.S.E., to round the
      island, and in about six days' sail got out of the wake of the island, and
      steered away north, till we came off Port Dauphin, and then north by east,
      to the latitude of 13 degrees 40 minutes, which was, in short, just at the
      farthest part of the island; and the admiral, keeping ahead, made the open
      sea fair to the west, clear of the whole island; upon which he brought to,
      and we sent a sloop to stand in round the farthest point north, and coast
      along the shore, and see for a harbour to put into, which they did, and
      soon brought us an account that there was a deep bay, with a very good
      road, and several little islands, under which they found good riding, in
      ten to seventeen fathom water, and accordingly there we put in.
    
    
      However, we afterwards found occasion to remove our station, as you shall
      hear presently. We had now nothing to do but go on shore, and acquaint
      ourselves a little with the natives, take in fresh water and some fresh
      provisions, and then to sea again. We found the people very easy to deal
      with, and some cattle they had; but it being at the extremity of the
      island, they had not such quantities of cattle here. However, for the
      present we resolved to appoint this for our place of rendezvous, and go
      and look out. This was about the latter end of April.
    
    
      Accordingly we put to sea, and cruised away to the northward, for the
      Arabian coast. It was a long run, but as the winds generally blow trade
      from the S. and S.S.E. from May to September, we had good weather; and in
      about twenty days we made the island of Socotra, lying south from the
      Arabian coast, and E.S.E. from the mouth of the Gulf of Mocha, or the Red
      Sea.
    
    
      Here we took in water, and stood off and on upon the Arabian shore. We had
      not cruised here above three days, or thereabouts, but I spied a sail, and
      gave her chase; but when we came up with her, never was such a poor prize
      chased by pirates that looked for booty, for we found nothing in her but
      poor, half-naked Turks, going a pilgrimage to Mecca, to the tomb of their
      prophet Mahomet. The junk that carried them had no one thing worth taking
      away but a little rice and some coffee, which was all the poor wretches
      had for their subsistence; so we let them go, for indeed we knew not what
      to do with them.
    
    
      The same evening we chased another junk with two masts, and in something
      better plight to look at than the former. When we came on board we found
      them upon the same errand, but only that they were people of some better
      fashion than the other; and here we got some plunder, some Turkish stores,
      a few diamonds in the ear-drops of five or six persons, some fine Persian
      carpets, of which they made their saffras to lie upon, and some money; so
      we let them go also.
    
    
      We continued here eleven days longer, and saw nothing but now and then a
      fishing-boat; but the twelfth day of our cruise we spied a ship: indeed I
      thought at first it had been an English ship, but it appeared to be an
      European freighted for a voyage from Goa, on the coast of Malabar, to the
      Red Sea, and was very rich. We chased her, and took her without any fight,
      though they had some guns on board too, but not many. We found her manned
      with Portuguese seamen, but under the direction of five merchant Turks,
      who had hired her on the coast of Malabar of some Portugal merchants, and
      had laden her with pepper, saltpetre, some spices, and the rest of the
      loading was chiefly calicoes and wrought silks, some of them very rich.
    
    
      We took her and carried her to Socotra; but we really knew not what to do
      with her, for the same reasons as before; for all their goods were of
      little or no value to us. After some days we found means to let one of the
      Turkish merchants know, that if he would ransom the ship we would take a
      sum of money and let them go. He told me that if I would let one of them
      go on shore for the money they would do it; so we adjusted the value of
      the cargo at 30,000 ducats. Upon this agreement, we allowed the sloop to
      carry him on shore, at Dofar, in Arabia, where a rich merchant laid down
      the money for them, and came off with our sloop; and on payment of the
      money we very fairly and honestly let them go.
    
    
      Some days after this we took an Arabian junk, going from the Gulf of
      Persia to Mocha, with a good quantity of pearl on board. We gutted him of
      the pearl, which it seems was belonging to some merchants at Mocha, and
      let him go, for there was nothing else worth our taking.
    
    
      We continued cruising up and down here till we began to find our
      provisions grow low, when Captain Wilmot, our admiral, told us it was time
      to think of going back to the rendezvous; and the rest of the men said the
      same, being a little weary of beating about for above three months
      together, and meeting with little or nothing compared to our great
      expectations; but I was very loth to part with the Red Sea at so cheap a
      rate, and pressed them to tarry a little longer, which at my instance they
      did; but three days afterwards, to our great misfortune, understood that,
      by landing the Turkish merchants at Dofar, we had alarmed the coast as far
      as the Gulf of Persia, so that no vessel would stir that way, and
      consequently nothing was to be expected on that side.
    
    
      I was greatly mortified at this news, and could no longer withstand the
      importunities of the men to return to Madagascar. However, as the wind
      continued still to blow at S.S.E. by S., we were obliged to stand away
      towards the coast of Africa and the Cape Guardafui, the winds being more
      variable under the shore than in the open sea.
    
    
      Here we chopped upon a booty which we did not look for, and which made
      amends for all our waiting; for the very same hour that we made land we
      spied a large vessel sailing along the shore to the southward. The ship
      was of Bengal, belonging to the Great Mogul's country, but had on board a
      Dutch pilot, whose name, if I remember right, was Vandergest, and several
      European seamen, whereof three were English. She was in no condition to
      resist us. The rest of her seamen were Indians of the Mogul's subjects,
      some Malabars and some others. There were five Indian merchants on board,
      and some Armenians. It seems they had been at Mocha with spices, silks,
      diamonds, pearls, calico,      c., such goods as the country afforded, and
      had little on board now but money in pieces of eight, which, by the way,
      was just what we wanted; and the three English seamen came along with us,
      and the Dutch pilot would have done so too, but the two Armenian merchants
      entreated us not to take him, for that he being their pilot, there was
      none of the men knew how to guide the ship; so, at their request, we
      refused him; but we made them promise he should not be used ill for being
      willing to go with us.
    
    
      We got near 200,000 pieces of eight in this vessel; and, if they said
      true, there was a Jew of Goa, who intended to have embarked with them, who
      had 200,000 pieces of eight with him, all his own; but his good fortune,
      springing out of his ill fortune, hindered him, or he fell sick at Mocha,
      and could not be ready to travel, which was the saving of his money.
    
    
      There was none with me at the taking this prize but the sloop, for Captain
      Wilmot's ship proving leaky, he went away for the rendezvous before us,
      and arrived there the middle of December; but not liking the port, he left
      a great cross on shore, with directions written on a plate of lead fixed
      to it, for us to come after him to the great bays at Mangahelly, where he
      found a very good harbour; but we learned a piece of news here that kept
      us from him a great while, which the admiral took offence at; but we
      stopped his mouth with his share of 200,000 pieces of eight to him and his
      ship's crew. But the story which interrupted our coming to him was this.
      Between Mangahelly and another point, called Cape St Sebastian, there came
      on shore in the night an European ship, and whether by stress of weather
      or want of a pilot I know not, but the ship stranded and could not be got
      off.
    
    
      We lay in the cove or harbour, where, as I have said, our rendezvous was
      appointed, and had not yet been on shore, so we had not seen the
      directions our admiral had left for us.
    
    
      Our friend William, of whom I have said nothing a great while, had a great
      mind one day to go on shore, and importuned me to let him have a little
      troop to go with him, for safety, that they might see the country. I was
      mightily against it for many reasons; but particularly I told him he knew
      the natives were but savages, and they were very treacherous, and I
      desired him that he would not go; and, had he gone on much farther, I
      believe I should have downright refused him, and commanded him not to go.
    
    
      But, in order to persuade me to let him go, he told me he would give me an
      account of the reason why he was so importunate. He told me, the last
      night he had a dream, which was so forcible, and made such an impression
      upon his mind, that he could not be quiet till he had made the proposal to
      me to go; and if I refused him, then he thought his dream was significant;
      and if not, then his dream was at an end.
    
    
      His dream was, he said, that he went on shore with thirty men, of which
      the cockswain, he said, was one, upon the island; and that they found a
      mine of gold, and enriched them all. But this was not the main thing, he
      said, but that the same morning he had dreamed so, the cockswain came to
      him just then, and told him that he dreamed he went on shore on the island
      of Madagascar, and that some men came to him and told him they would show
      him where he should get a prize which would make them all rich.
    
    
      These two things put together began to weigh with me a little, though I
      was never inclined to give any heed to dreams; but William's importunity
      turned me effectually, for I always put a great deal of stress upon his
      judgment; so that, in short, I gave them leave to go, but I charged them
      not to go far off from the sea-coast; that, if they were forced down to
      the seaside upon any occasion, we might perhaps see them, and fetch them
      off with our boats.
    
    
      They went away early in the morning, one-and-thirty men of them in number,
      very well armed, and very stout fellows; they travelled all the day, and
      at night made us a signal that all was well, from the top of a hill, which
      we had agreed on, by making a great fire.
    
    
      Next day they marched down the hill on the other side, inclining towards
      the seaside, as they had promised, and saw a very pleasant valley before
      them, with a river in the middle of it, which, a little farther below
      them, seemed to be big enough to bear small ships; they marched apace
      towards this river, and were surprised with the noise of a piece going
      off, which, by the sound, could not be far off. They listened long, but
      could hear no more; so they went on to the river-side, which was a very
      fine fresh stream, but widened apace, and they kept on by the banks of it,
      till, almost at once, it opened or widened into a good large creek or
      harbour, about five miles from the sea; and that which was still more
      surprising, as they marched forward, they plainly saw in the mouth of the
      harbour, or creek, the wreck of a ship.
    
    
      The tide was up, as we call it, so that it did net appear very much above
      the water, but, as they made downwards, they found it grow bigger and
      bigger; and the tide soon after ebbing out, they found it lay dry upon the
      sands, and appeared to be the wreck of a considerable vessel, larger than
      could be expected in that country.
    
    
      After some time, William, taking out his glass to look at it more nearly,
      was surprised with hearing a musket-shot whistle by him, and immediately
      after that he heard the gun, and saw the smoke from the other side; upon
      which our men immediately fired three muskets, to discover, if possible,
      what or who they were. Upon the noise of these guns, abundance of men came
      running down to the shore from among the trees; and our men could easily
      perceive that they were Europeans, though they knew not of what nation;
      however, our men hallooed to them as loud as they could, and by-and-by
      they got a long pole, and set it up, and hung a white shirt upon it for a
      flag of truce. They on the other side saw it, by the help of their
      glasses, too, and quickly after our men see a boat launch off from the
      shore, as they thought, but it was from another creek, it seems; and
      immediately they came rowing over the creek to our men, carrying also a
      white flag as a token of truce.
    
    
      It is not easy to describe the surprise, or joy and satisfaction, that
      appeared on both sides, to see not only white men, but Englishmen, in a
      place so remote; but what then must it be when they came to know one
      another, and to find that they were not only countrymen but comrades, and
      that this was the very ship that Captain Wilmot, our admiral, commanded,
      and whose company we had lost in the storm at Tobago, after making an
      agreement to rendezvous at Madagascar!
    
    
      They had, it seems, got intelligence of us when they came to the south
      part of the island, and had been a-roving as far as the Gulf of Bengal,
      when they met Captain Avery, with whom they joined, took several rich
      prizes, and, amongst the rest, one ship with the Great Mogul's daughter,
      and an immense treasure in money and jewels; and from thence they came
      about the coast of Coromandel, and afterwards that of Malabar, into the
      Gulf of Persia, where they also took some prize, and then designed for the
      south part of Madagascar; but the winds blowing hard at S.E. and S.E. by
      E., they came to the northward of the isle, and being after that separated
      by a furious tempest from the N.W., they were forced into the mouth of
      that creek, where they lost their ship. And they told us, also, that they
      heard that Captain Avery himself had lost his ship also not far off.
    
    
      When they had thus acquainted one another with their fortunes, the poor
      overjoyed men were in haste to go back to communicate their joy to their
      comrades; and, leaving some of their men with ours, the rest went back,
      and William was so earnest to see them that he and two more went back with
      them, and there he came to their little camp where they lived. There were
      about a hundred and sixty men of them in all; they had got their guns on
      shore, and some ammunition, but a good deal of their powder was spoiled;
      however, they had raised a fair platform, and mounted twelve pieces of
      cannon upon it, which was a sufficient defence to them on that side of the
      sea; and just at the end of the platform they had made a launch and a
      little yard, and were all hard at work, building another little ship, as I
      may call it, to go to sea in; but they put a stop to this work upon the
      news they had of our being come in.
    
    
      When our men went into their huts, it was surprising, indeed, to see the
      vast stock of wealth they had got, in gold and silver and jewels, which,
      however, they told us was a trifle to what Captain Avery had, wherever he
      was gone.
    
    
      It was five days we had waited for our men, and no news of them; and
      indeed I gave them over for lost, but was surprised, after five days'
      waiting, to see a ship's boat come rowing towards us along shore. What to
      make of it I could not tell, but was at least better satisfied when our
      men told me they heard them halloo and saw them wave their caps to us.
    
    
      In a little time they came quite up to us; and I saw friend William stand
      up in the boat and make signs to us; so they came on board; but when I saw
      there were but fifteen of our one-and-thirty men, I asked him what had
      become of their fellows. "Oh," says William, "they are all very well; and
      my dream is fully made good, and the cockswain's too."
    
    
      This made me very impatient to know how the case stood; so he told us the
      whole story, which indeed surprised us all. The next day we weighed, and
      stood away southerly to join Captain Wilmot and ship at Mangahelly, where
      we found him, as I said, a little chagrined at our stay; but we pacified
      him afterwards with telling him the history of William's dream, and the
      consequence of it.
    
    
      In the meantime the camp of our comrades was so near Mangahelly, that our
      admiral and I, friend William, and some of the men, resolved to take the
      sloop and go and see them, and fetch them all, and their goods, bag and
      baggage, on board our ship, which accordingly we did, and found their
      camp, their fortifications, the battery of guns they had erected, their
      treasure, and all the men, just as William had related it; so, after some
      stay, we took all the men into the sloop, and brought them away with us.
    
    
      It was some time before we knew what was become of Captain Avery; but
      after about a month, by the direction of the men who had lost their ship,
      we sent the sloop to cruise along the shore, to find out, if possible,
      where they were; and in about a week's cruise our men found them, and
      particularly that they had lost their ship, as well as our men had lost
      theirs, and that they were every way in as bad a condition as ours.
    
    
      It was about ten days before the sloop returned, and Captain Avery with
      them; and this was the whole force that, as I remember, Captain Avery ever
      had with him; for now we joined all our companies together, and it stood
      thus:       We had two ships and a sloop, in which we had 320 men, but
      much too few to man them as they ought to be, the great Portuguese ship
      requiring of herself near 400 men to man her completely. As for our lost,
      but now found comrade, her complement of men was 180, or thereabouts; and
      Captain Avery had about 300 men with him, whereof he had ten carpenters
      with him, most of which were taken aboard the prize they had taken; so
      that, in a word, all the force Avery had at Madagascar, in the year 1699,
      or thereabouts, amounted to our three ships, for his own was lost, as you
      have heard; and never had any more than about 1200 men in all.
    
    
      It was about a month after this that all our crews got together, and as
      Avery was unshipped, we all agreed to bring our own company into the
      Portuguese man-of-war and the sloop, and give Captain Avery the Spanish
      frigate, with all the tackles and furniture, guns and ammunition, for his
      crew by themselves; for which they, being full of wealth, agreed to give
      us 40,000 pieces of eight.
    
    
      It was next considered what course we should take. Captain Avery, to give
      him his due, proposed our building a little city here, establishing
      ourselves on shore, with a good fortification and works proper to defend
      ourselves; and that, as we had wealth enough, and could increase it to
      what degree we pleased, we should content ourselves to retire here, and
      bid defiance to the world. But I soon convinced him that this place would
      be no security to us, if we pretended to carry on our cruising trade; for
      that then all the nations of Europe, and indeed of that part of the world,
      would be engaged to root us out; but if we resolved to live there as in
      retirement, and plant in the country as private men, and give over our
      trade of pirating, then, indeed, we might plant and settle ourselves where
      we pleased. But then, I told him, the best way would be to treat with the
      natives, and buy a tract of land of them farther up the country, seated
      upon some navigable river, where boats might go up and down for pleasure,
      but not ships to endanger us; that thus planting the high ground with
      cattle, such as cows and goats, of which the country also was full, to be
      sure we might live here as well as any men in the world; and I owned to
      him I thought it was a good retreat for those that were willing to leave
      off and lay down, and yet did not care to venture home and be hanged; that
      is to say, to run the risk of it.
    
    
      Captain Avery, however he made no positive discovery of his intentions,
      seemed to me to decline my notion of going up into the country to plant;
      on the contrary, it was apparent he was of Captain Wilmot's opinion, that
      they might maintain themselves on shore, and yet carry on their cruising
      trade too; and upon this they resolved. But, as I afterwards understood,
      about fifty of their men went up the country, and settled themselves in an
      inland place as a colony. Whether they are there still or not, I cannot
      tell, or how many of them are left alive; but it is my opinion they are
      there still, and that they are considerably increased, for, as I hear,
      they have got some women among them, though not many; for it seems five
      Dutch women and three or four little girls were taken by them in a Dutch
      ship, which they afterwards took going to Mocha; and three of those women,
      marrying some of these men, went with them to live in their new
      plantation. But of this I speak only by hearsay.
    
    
      As we lay here some time, I found our people mightily divided in their
      notions; some were for going this way, and some that, till at last I began
      to foresee they would part company, and perhaps we should not have men
      enough to keep together to man the great ship; so I took Captain Wilmot
      aside, and began to talk to him about it, but soon perceived that he
      inclined himself to stay at Madagascar, and having got a vast wealth for
      his own share, had secret designs of getting home some way or other.
    
    
      I argued the impossibility of it, and the hazard he would run, either of
      falling into the hands of thieves and murderers in the Red Sea, who would
      never let such a treasure as his pass their hands, or of his falling into
      the hands of the English, Dutch, or French, who would certainly hang him
      for a pirate. I gave him an account of the voyage I had made from this
      very place to the continent of Africa, and what a journey it was to travel
      on foot.
    
    
      In short, nothing could persuade him, but he would go into the Red Sea
      with the sloop, and where the children of Israel passed through the sea
      dry-shod, and, landing there, would travel to Grand Cairo by land, which
      is not above eighty miles, and from thence he said he could ship himself,
      by the way of Alexandria, to any part of the world.
    
    
      I represented the hazard, and indeed the impossibility, of his passing by
      Mocha and Jiddah without being attacked, if he offered it by force, or
      plundered, if he went to get leave; and explained the reasons of it so
      much and so effectually, that, though at last he would not hearken to it
      himself, none of his men would go with him. They told him they would go
      anywhere with him to serve him, but that this was running himself and them
      into certain destruction, without any possibility of avoiding it, or
      probability of answering his end. The captain took what I said to him
      quite wrong, and pretended to resent it, and gave me some buccaneer words
      upon it; but I gave him no return to it but this: that I advised him for
      his advantage; that if he did not understand it so, it was his fault, not
      mine; that I did not forbid him to go, nor had I offered to persuade any
      of the men not to go with him, though it was to their apparent
      destruction.
    
    
      However, warm heads are not easily cooled. The captain was so eager that
      he quitted our company, and, with most part of his crew, went over to
      Captain Avery, and sorted with his people, taking all the treasure with
      him, which, by the way, was not very fair in him, we having agreed to
      share all our gains, whether more or less, whether absent or present.
    
    
      Our men muttered a little at it, but I pacified them as well as I could,
      and told them it was easy for us to get as much, if we minded our hits;
      and Captain Wilmot had set us a very good example; for, by the same rule,
      the agreement of any further sharing of profits with them was at an end. I
      took this occasion to put into their heads some part of my further
      designs, which were, to range over the eastern sea, and see if we could
      not make ourselves as rich as Mr Avery, who, it was true, had gotten a
      prodigious deal of money, though not one-half of what was said of it in
      Europe.
    
    
      Our men were so pleased with my forward, enterprising temper, that they
      assured me that they would go with me, one and all, over the whole globe,
      wherever I would carry them; and as for Captain Wilmot, they would have
      nothing more to do with him. This came to his ears, and put him into a
      great rage, so that he threatened, if I came on shore, he would cut my
      throat.
    
    
      I had information of it privately, but took no notice of it at all; only I
      took care not to go unprovided for him, and seldom walked about but in
      very good company. However, at last Captain Wilmot and I met, and talked
      over the matter very seriously, and I offered him the sloop to go where he
      pleased, or, if he was not satisfied with that, I offered to take the
      sloop and leave him the great ship; but he declined both, and only desired
      that I would leave him six carpenters, which I had in our ship more than I
      had need of, to help his men to finish the sloop that was begun before we
      came thither, by the men that lost their ship. This I consented readily
      to, and lent him several other hands that were useful to them; and in a
      little time they built a stout brigantine, able to carry fourteen guns and
      200 men.
    
    
      What measures they took, and how Captain Avery managed afterwards, is too
      long a story to meddle with here; nor is it any of my business, having my
      own story still upon my hands.
    
    
      We lay here, about these several simple disputes, almost five months,
      when, about the latter end of March, I set sail with the great ship,
      having in her forty-four guns and 400 men, and the sloop, carrying eighty
      men. We did not steer to the Malabar coast, and so to the Gulf of Persia,
      as was first intended, the east monsoons blowing yet too strong, but we
      kept more under the African coast, where we had the wind variable till we
      passed the line, and made the Cape Bassa, in the latitude of four degrees
      ten minutes; from thence, the monsoons beginning to change to the N.E. and
      N.N.E., we led it away, with the wind large, to the Maldives, a famous
      ledge of islands, well known by all the sailors who have gone into those
      parts of the world; and, leaving these islands a little to the south, we
      made Cape Comorin, the southernmost land of the coast of Malabar, and went
      round the isle of Ceylon. Here we lay by a while to wait for purchase; and
      here we saw three large English East India ships going from Bengal, or
      from Fort St George, homeward for England, or rather for Bombay and Surat,
      till the trade set in.
    
    
      We brought to, and hoisting an English ancient and pendant, lay by for
      them, as if we intended to attack them. They could not tell what to make
      of us a good while, though they saw our colours; and I believe at first
      they thought us to be French; but as they came nearer to us, we let them
      soon see what we were, for we hoisted a black flag, with two cross daggers
      in it, on our main-top-mast head, which let them see what they were to
      expect.
    
    
      We soon found the effects of this; for at first they spread their
      ancients, and made up to us in a line, as if they would fight us, having
      the wind off shore, fair enough to have brought them on board us; but when
      they saw what force we were of, and found we were cruisers of another
      kind, they stood away from us again, with all the sail they could make. If
      they had come up, we should have given them an unexpected welcome, but as
      it was, we had no mind to follow them; so we let them go, for the same
      reasons which I mentioned before.
    
    
      But though we let them pass, we did not design to let others go at so easy
      a price. It was but the next morning that we saw a sail standing round
      Cape Comorin, and steering, as we thought, the same course with us. We
      knew not at first what to do with her, because she had the shore on her
      larboard quarter, and if we offered to chase her, she might put into any
      port or creek, and escape us; but, to prevent this, we sent the sloop to
      get in between her and the land. As soon as she saw that, she hauled in to
      keep the land aboard, and when the sloop stood towards her she made right
      ashore, with all the canvas she could spread.
    
    
      The sloop, however, came up with her and engaged her, and found she was a
      vessel of ten guns, Portuguese built, but in the Dutch traders' hands, and
      manned by Dutchmen, who were bound from the Gulf of Persia to Batavia, to
      fetch spices and other goods from thence. The sloop's men took her, and
      had the rummaging of her before we came up. She had in her some European
      goods, and a good round sum of money, and some pearl; so that, though we
      did not go to the gulf for the pearl, the pearl came to us out of the
      gulf, and we had our share of it. This was a rich ship, and the goods were
      of very considerable value, besides the money and the pearl.
    
    
      We had a long consultation here what we should do with the men, for to
      give them the ship, and let them pursue their voyage to Java, would be to
      alarm the Dutch factory there, who are by far the strongest in the Indies,
      and to make our passage that way impracticable; whereas we resolved to
      visit that part of the world in our way, but were not willing to pass the
      great Bay of Bengal, where we hoped for a great deal of purchase; and
      therefore it behoved us not to be waylaid before we came there, because
      they knew we must pass by the Straits of Malacca, or those of Sunda; and
      either way it was very easy to prevent us.
    
    
      While we were consulting this in the great cabin, the men had had the same
      debate before the mast; and it seems the majority there were for pickling
      up the poor Dutchmen among the herrings; in a word, they were for throwing
      them all into the sea. Poor William, the Quaker, was in great concern
      about this, and comes directly to me to talk about it. "Hark thee," says
      William, "what wilt thou do with these Dutchmen that thou hast on board?
      Thou wilt not let them go, I suppose," says he. "Why," says I, "William,
      would you advise me to let them go?" "No," says William, "I cannot say it
      is fit for thee to let them go; that is to say, to go on with their voyage
      to Batavia, because it is not for thy turn that the Dutch at Batavia
      should have any knowledge of thy being in these seas." "Well, then," says
      I to him, "I know no remedy but to throw them overboard. You know,
      William," says I, "a Dutchman swims like a fish; and all our people here
      are of the same opinion as well as I." At the same time I resolved it
      should not be done, but wanted to hear what William would say. He gravely
      replied, "If all the men in the ship were of that mind, I will never
      believe that thou wilt be of that mind thyself, for I have heard thee
      protest against cruelty in all other cases." "Well, William," says I,
      "that is true; but what then shall we do with them?" "Why," says William,
      "is there no way but to murder them? I am persuaded thou canst not be in
      earnest." "No, indeed, William," says I, "I am not in earnest; but they
      shall not go to Java, no, nor to Ceylon, that is certain." "But," says
      William, "the men have done thee no injury at all; thou hast taken a great
      treasure from them; what canst thou pretend to hurt them for?" "Nay,
      William," says I, "do not talk of that; I have pretence enough, if that be
      all; my pretence is, to prevent doing me hurt, and that is as necessary a
      piece of the law of self-preservation as any you can name; but the main
      thing is, I know not what to do with them, to prevent their prating."
    
    
      While William and I were talking, the poor Dutchmen were openly condemned
      to die, as it may be called, by the whole ship's company; and so warm were
      the men upon it, that they grew very clamorous; and when they heard that
      William was against it, some of them swore they should die, and if William
      opposed it, he should drown along with them.
    
    
      But, as I was resolved to put an end to their cruel project, so I found it
      was time to take upon me a little, or the bloody humour might grow too
      strong; so I called the Dutchmen up, and talked a little with them. First,
      I asked them if they were willing to go with us. Two of them offered it
      presently; but the rest, which were fourteen, declined it. "Well, then,"
      said I, "where would you go?" They desired they should go to Ceylon. No, I
      told them I could not allow them to go to any Dutch factory, and told them
      very plainly the reasons of it, which they could not deny to be just. I
      let them know also the cruel, bloody measures of our men, but that I had
      resolved to save them, if possible; and therefore I told them I would set
      them on shore at some English factory in the Bay of Bengal, or put them on
      board any English ship I met, after I was past the Straits of Sunda or of
      Malacca, but not before; for, as to my coming back again, I told them I
      would run the venture of their Dutch power from Batavia, but I would not
      have the news come there before me, because it would make all their
      merchant-ships lay up, and keep out of our way.
    
    
      It came next into our consideration what we should do with their ship; but
      this was not long resolving; for there were but two ways, either to set
      her on fire, or to run her on shore, and we chose the last. So we set her
      foresail with the tack at the cat-head, and lashed her helm a little to
      starboard, to answer her head-sail, and so set her agoing, with neither
      cat or dog in her; and it was not above two hours before we saw her run
      right ashore upon the coast, a little beyond the Cape Comorin; and away we
      went round about Ceylon, for the coast of Coromandel.
    
    
      We sailed along there, not in sight of the shore only, but so near as to
      see the ships in the road at Fort St David, Fort St George, and at the
      other factories along that shore, as well as along the coast of Golconda,
      carrying our English ancient when we came near the Dutch factories, and
      Dutch colours when we passed by the English factories. We met with little
      purchase upon this coast, except two small vessels of Golconda, bound
      across the bay with bales of calicoes and muslins and wrought silks, and
      fifteen bales of romals, from the bottom of the bay, which were going, on
      whose account we knew not, to Acheen, and to other ports on the coast of
      Malacca. We did not inquire to what place in particular; but we let the
      vessels go, having none but Indians on board.
    
    
      In the bottom of the bay we met with a great junk belonging to the Mogul's
      court, with a great many people, passengers as we supposed them to be: it
      seems they were bound for the river Hooghly or Ganges, and came from
      Sumatra. This was a prize worth taking indeed; and we got so much gold in
      her, besides other goods which we did not meddle with       pepper in
      particular       that it had like to have put an end to our cruise; for
      almost all my men said we were rich enough, and desired to go back again
      to Madagascar. But I had other things in my head still, and when I came to
      talk with them, and set friend William to talk with them, we put such
      further golden hopes into their heads that we soon prevailed with them to
      let us go on.
    
    
      My next design was to leave all the dangerous straits of Malacca,
      Singapore, and Sunda, where we could expect no great booty, but what we
      might light on in European ships, which we must fight for; and though we
      were able to fight, and wanted no courage, even to desperation, yet we
      were rich too, and resolved to be richer, and took this for our maxim,
      that while we were sure the wealth we sought was to be had without
      fighting, we had no occasion to put ourselves to the necessity of fighting
      for that which would come upon easy terms.
    
    
      We left, therefore, the Bay of Bengal, and coming to the coast of Sumatra,
      we put in at a small port, where there was a town, inhabited only by
      Malays; and here we took in fresh water, and a large quantity of good
      pork, pickled up and well salted, notwithstanding the heat of the climate,
      being in the very middle of the torrid zone, viz., in three degrees
      fifteen minutes north latitude. We also took on board both our vessels
      forty hogs alive, which served us for fresh provisions, having abundance
      of food for them, such as the country produced, such as guams, potatoes,
      and a sort of coarse rice, good for nothing else but to feed the swine. We
      killed one of these hogs every day, and found them to be excellent meat.
      We took in also a monstrous quantity of ducks, and cocks and hens, the
      same kind as we have in England, which we kept for change of provisions;
      and if I remember right, we had no less than two thousand of them; so that
      at first we were pestered with them very much, but we soon lessened them
      by boiling, roasting, stewing,      c., for we never wanted while we had
      them.
    
    
      My long-projected design now lay open to me, which was to fall in amongst
      the Dutch Spice Islands, and see what mischief I could do there.
      Accordingly, we put out to sea the 12th of August, and passing the line on
      the 17th, we stood away due south, leaving the Straits of Sunda and the
      isle of Java on the east, till we came to the latitude of eleven degrees
      twenty minutes, when we steered east and E.N.E., having easy gales from
      the W.S.W. till we came among the Moluccas, or Spice Islands.
    
    
      We passed those seas with less difficulty than in other places, the winds
      to the south of Java being more variable, and the weather good, though
      sometimes we met with squally weather and short storms; but when we came
      in among the Spice Islands themselves we had a share of the monsoons, or
      trade-winds, and made use of them accordingly.
    
    
      The infinite number of islands which lie in these seas embarrassed us
      strangely, and it was with great difficulty that we worked our way through
      them; then we steered for the north side of the Philippines, when we had a
      double chance for purchase, viz., either to meet with the Spanish ships
      from Acapulco, on the coast of New Spain, or we were certain not to fail
      of finding some ships or junks of China, who, if they came from China,
      would have a great quantity of goods of value on board, as well as money;
      or if we took them going back, we should find them laden with nutmegs and
      cloves from Banda and Ternate, or from some of the other islands.
    
    
      We were right in our guesses here to a tittle, and we steered directly
      through a large outlet, which they call a strait, though it be fifteen
      miles broad, and to an island they call Dammer, and from thence N.N.E. to
      Banda. Between these islands we met with a Dutch junk, or vessel, going to
      Amboyna: we took her without much trouble, and I had much ado to prevent
      our men murdering all the men, as soon as they heard them say they
      belonged to Amboyna: the reasons I suppose any one will guess.
    
    
      We took out of her about sixteen ton of nutmegs, some provisions, and
      their small-arms, for they had no great guns, and let the ship go: from
      thence we sailed directly to the Banda Island, or Islands, where we were
      sure to get more nutmegs if we thought fit. For my part, I would willingly
      have got more nutmegs, though I had paid for them, but our people abhorred
      paying for anything; so we got about twelve ton more at several times,
      most of them from shore, and only a few in a small boat of the natives,
      which was going to Gilolo. We would have traded openly, but the Dutch, who
      have made themselves masters of all those islands, forbade the people
      dealing with us, or any strangers whatever, and kept them so in awe that
      they durst not do it; so we could indeed have made nothing of it if we had
      stayed longer, and therefore resolved to be gone for Ternate, and see if
      we could make up our loading with cloves.
    
    
      Accordingly we stood away north, but found ourselves so entangled among
      innumerable islands, and without any pilot that understood the channel and
      races between them, that we were obliged to give it over, and resolved to
      go back again to Banda, and see what we could get among the other islands
      thereabouts.
    
    
      The first adventure we made here had like to have been fatal to us all,
      for the sloop, being ahead, made the signal to us for seeing a sail, and
      afterwards another, and a third, by which we understood she saw three
      sail; whereupon we made more sail to come up with her, but on a sudden
      were gotten among some rocks, falling foul upon them in such a manner as
      frighted us all very heartily; for having, it seems, but just water
      enough, as it were to an inch, our rudder struck upon the top of a rock,
      which gave us a terrible shock, and split a great piece off the rudder,
      and indeed disabled it so that our ship would not steer at all, at least
      not so as to be depended upon; and we were glad to hand all our sails,
      except our fore-sail and main-topsail, and with them we stood away to the
      east, to see if we could find any creek or harbour where we might lay the
      ship on shore, and repair our rudder; besides, we found the ship herself
      had received some damage, for she had some little leak near her
      stern-post, but a great way under water.
    
    
      By this mischance we lost the advantages, whatever they were, of the three
      sail of ships, which we afterwards came to hear were small Dutch ships
      from Batavia, going to Banda and Amboyna, to load spice, and, no doubt,
      had a good quantity of money on board.
    
    
      Upon the disaster I have been speaking of you may very well suppose that
      we came to an anchor as soon as we could, which was upon a small island
      not far from Banda, where, though the Dutch keep no factory, yet they come
      at the season to buy nutmegs and mace. We stayed there thirteen days; but
      there being no place where we could lay the ship on shore, we sent the
      sloop to cruise among the islands, to look out for a place fit for us. In
      the meantime we got very good water here, some provisions, roots, and
      fruits, and a good quantity of nutmegs and mace, which we found ways to
      trade with the natives for, without the knowledge of their masters, the
      Dutch.
    
    
      At length our sloop returned; having found another island where there was
      a very good harbour, we ran in, and came to an anchor. We immediately
      unbent all our sails, sent them ashore upon the island, and set up seven
      or eight tents with them; then we unrigged our top-masts, and cut them
      down, hoisted all our guns out, our provisions and loading, and put them
      ashore in the tents. With the guns we made two small batteries, for fear
      of a surprise, and kept a look-out upon the hill. When we were all ready,
      we laid the ship aground upon a hard sand, the upper end of the harbour,
      and shored her up on each side. At low water she lay almost dry, so we
      mended her bottom, and stopped the leak, which was occasioned by straining
      some of the rudder irons with the shock which the ship had against the
      rock.
    
    
      Having done this, we also took occasion to clean her bottom, which, having
      been at sea so long, was very foul. The sloop washed and tallowed also,
      but was ready before us, and cruised eight or ten days among the islands,
      but met with no purchase; so that we began to be tired of the place,
      having little to divert us but the most furious claps of thunder that ever
      were heard or read of in the world.
    
    
      We were in hopes to have met with some purchase here among the Chinese,
      who, we had been told, came to Ternate to trade for cloves, and to the
      Banda Isles for nutmegs; and we would have been very glad to have loaded
      our galleon, or great ship, with these two sorts of spice, and have
      thought it a glorious voyage; but we found nothing stirring more than what
      I have said, except Dutchmen, who, by what means we could not imagine, had
      either a jealousy of us or intelligence of us, and kept themselves close
      in their ports.
    
    
      I was once resolved to have made a descent at the island of Dumas, the
      place most famous for the best nutmegs; but friend William, who was always
      for doing our business without fighting, dissuaded me from it, and gave
      such reasons for it that we could not resist; particularly the great heats
      of the season, and of the place, for we were now in the latitude of just
      half a degree south. But while we were disputing this point we were soon
      determined by the following accident:       We had a strong gale of wind
      at S.W. by W., and the ship had fresh way, but a great sea rolling in upon
      us from the N.E., which we afterwards found was the pouring in of the
      great ocean east of New Guinea. However, as I said, we stood away large,
      and made fresh way, when, on the sudden, from a dark cloud which hovered
      over our heads, came a flash, or rather blast, of lightning, which was so
      terrible, and quivered so long among us, that not I only, but all our men,
      thought the ship was on fire. The heat of the flash, or fire, was so
      sensibly felt in our faces, that some of our men had blisters raised by it
      on their skins, not immediately, perhaps, by the heat, but by the
      poisonous or noxious particles which mixed themselves with the matter
      inflamed. But this was not all; the shock of the air, which the fracture
      in the clouds made, was such that our ship shook as when a broadside is
      fired; and her motion being checked, as it were at once, by a repulse
      superior to the force that gave her way before, the sails all flew back in
      a moment, and the ship lay, as we might truly say, thunder-struck. As the
      blast from the cloud was so very near us, it was but a few moments after
      the flash that the terriblest clap of thunder followed that was ever heard
      by mortals. I firmly believe a blast of a hundred thousand barrels of
      gunpowder could not have been greater to our hearing; nay, indeed, to some
      of our men it took away their hearing.
    
    
      It is not possible for me to describe, or any one to conceive, the terror
      of that minute. Our men were in such a consternation, that not a man on
      board the ship had presence of mind to apply to the proper duty of a
      sailor, except friend William; and had he not run very nimbly, and with a
      composure that I am sure I was not master of, to let go the fore-sheet,
      set in the weather-brace of the fore-yard, and haul down the top-sails, we
      had certainly brought all our masts by the board, and perhaps have been
      overwhelmed in the sea.
    
    
      As for myself, I must confess my eyes were open to my danger, though not
      the least to anything of application for remedy. I was all amazement and
      confusion, and this was the first time that I can say I began to feel the
      effects of that horror which I know since much more of, upon the just
      reflection on my former life. I thought myself doomed by Heaven to sink
      that moment into eternal destruction; and with this peculiar mark of
      terror, viz., that the vengeance was not executed in the ordinary way of
      human justice, but that God had taken me into His immediate disposing, and
      had resolved to be the executer of His own vengeance.
    
    
      Let them alone describe the confusion I was in who know what was the case
      of [John] Child, of Shadwell, or Francis Spira. It is impossible to
      describe it. My soul was all amazement and surprise. I thought myself just
      sinking into eternity, owning the divine justice of my punishment, but not
      at all feeling any of the moving, softening tokens of a sincere penitent;
      afflicted at the punishment, but not at the crime; alarmed at the
      vengeance, but not terrified at the guilt; having the same gust to the
      crime, though terrified to the last degree at the thought of the
      punishment, which I concluded I was just now going to receive.
    
    
      But perhaps many that read this will be sensible of the thunder and
      lightning, that may think nothing of the rest, or rather may make a jest
      of it all; so I say no more of it at this time, but proceed to the story
      of the voyage. When the amazement was over, and the men began to come to
      themselves, they fell a-calling for one another, every one for his friend,
      or for those he had most respect for; and it was a singular satisfaction
      to find that nobody was hurt. The next thing was to inquire if the ship
      had received no damage, when the boatswain, stepping forward, found that
      part of the head was gone, but not so as to endanger the bowsprit; so we
      hoisted our top-sails again, hauled aft the fore-sheet, braced the yards,
      and went our course as before. Nor can I deny but that we were all
      somewhat like the ship; our first astonishment being a little over, and
      that we found the ship swim again, we were soon the same irreligious,
      hardened crew that we were before, and I among the rest.
    
    
      As we now steered, our course lay N.N.E., and we passed thus, with a fair
      wind, through the strait or channel between the island of Gilolo and the
      land of Nova Guinea, when we were soon in the open sea or ocean, on the
      south-east of the Philippines, being the great Pacific, or South Sea,
      where it may be said to join itself with the vast Indian Ocean.
    
    
      As we passed into these seas, steering due north, so we soon crossed the
      line to the north side, and so sailed on towards Mindanao and Manilla, the
      chief of the Philippine Islands, without meeting with any purchase till we
      came to the northward of Manilla, and then our trade began; for here we
      took three Japanese vessels, though at some distance from Manilla. Two of
      them had made their market, and were going home with nutmegs, cinnamon,
      cloves,      c., besides all sorts of European goods, brought with the
      Spanish ships from Acapulco. They had together eight-and-thirty ton of
      cloves, and five or six ton of nutmegs, and as much cinnamon. We took the
      spice, but meddled with very little of the European goods, they being, as
      we thought, not worth our while; but we were very sorry for it soon after,
      and therefore grew wiser upon the next occasion.
    
    
      The third Japanese was the best prize to us; for he came with money, and a
      great deal of gold uncoined, to buy such goods as we mentioned above. We
      eased him of his gold, and did him no other harm, and having no intention
      to stay long here, we stood away for China.
    
    
      We were at sea above two months upon this voyage, beating it up against
      the wind, which blew steadily from the N.E., and within a point or two one
      way or other; and this indeed was the reason why we met with the more
      prizes in our voyage.
    
    
      We were just gotten clear of the Philippines, and we purposed to go to the
      isle of Formosa, but the wind blew so fresh at N.N.E. that there was no
      making anything of it, and we were forced to put back to Laconia, the most
      northerly of those islands. We rode here very secure, and shifted our
      situation, not in view of any danger, for there was none, but for a better
      supply of provisions, which we found the people very willing to supply us
      with.
    
    
      There lay, while we remained here, three very great galleons, or Spanish
      ships, from the south seas; whether newly come in or ready to sail we
      could not understand at first; but as we found the China traders began to
      load and set forward to the north, we concluded the Spanish ships had
      newly unloaded their cargo, and these had been buying; so we doubted not
      but we should meet with purchase in the rest of the voyage, neither,
      indeed, could we well miss of it.
    
    
      We stayed here till the beginning of May, when we were told the Chinese
      traders would set forward; for the northern monsoons end about the latter
      end of March or beginning of April; so that they are sure of fair winds
      home. Accordingly we hired some of the country boats, which are very swift
      sailers, to go and bring us word how affairs stood at Manilla, and when
      the China junks would sail; and by this intelligence we ordered our
      matters so well, that three days after we set sail we fell in with no less
      than eleven of them; out of which, however, having by misfortune of
      discovering ourselves, taken but three, we contented ourselves and pursued
      our voyage to Formosa. In these three vessels we took, in short, such a
      quantity of cloves, nutmegs, cinnamon, and mace, besides silver, that our
      men began to be of my opinion,       that we were rich enough; and, in
      short, we had nothing to do now but to consider by what methods to secure
      the immense treasure we had got.
    
    
      I was secretly glad to hear that they were of this opinion, for I had long
      before resolved, if it were possible, to persuade them to think of
      returning, having fully perfected my first projected design of rummaging
      among the Spice Islands; and all those prizes, which were exceeding rich
      at Manilla, was quite beyond my design.
    
    
      But now I had heard what the men said, and how they thought we were very
      well, I let them know by friend William, that I intended only to sail to
      the island of Formosa, where I should find opportunity to turn our spices
      and Europe goods into ready money, and that then I would tack about for
      the south, the northern monsoons being perhaps by that time also ready to
      set in. They all approved of my design, and willingly went forward;
      because, besides the winds, which would not permit until October to go to
      the south, I say, besides this, we were now a very deep ship, having near
      two hundred ton of goods on board, and particularly, some very valuable;
      the sloop also had a proportion.
    
    
      With this resolution we went on cheerfully, when, within about twelve
      days' sail more, we made the island Formosa, at a great distance, but were
      ourselves shot beyond the southernmost part of the island, being to
      leeward, and almost upon the coast of China. Here we were a little at a
      loss, for the English factories were not far off, and we might be obliged
      to fight some of their ships, if we met with them; which, though we were
      able enough to do, yet we did not desire it on many accounts, and
      particularly because we did not think it was our business to have it known
      who we were, or that such a kind of people as we had been seen on the
      coast. However, we were obliged to keep to the northward, keeping as good
      an offing as we could with respect to the coast of China.
    
    
      We had not sailed long but we chased a small Chinese junk, and having
      taken her, we found she was bound to the island of Formosa, having no
      goods on board but some rice and a small quantity of tea; but she had
      three Chinese merchants in her; and they told us that they were going to
      meet a large vessel of their country, which came from Tonquin, and lay in
      a river in Formosa, whose name I forgot; and they were going to the
      Philippine Islands, with silks, muslins, calicoes, and such goods as are
      the product of China, and some gold; that their business was to sell their
      cargo, and buy spices and European goods.
    
    
      This suited very well with our purpose; so I resolved now that we would
      leave off being pirates and turn merchants; so we told them what goods we
      had on board, and that if they would bring their supercargoes or merchants
      on board, we would trade with them. They were very willing to trade with
      us, but terribly afraid to trust us; nor was it an unjust fear, for we had
      plundered them already of what they had. On the other hand, we were as
      diffident as they, and very uncertain what to do; but William the Quaker
      put this matter into a way of barter. He came to me and told me he really
      thought the merchants looked like fair men, that meant honestly. "And
      besides," says William, "it is their interest to be honest now, for, as
      they know upon what terms we got the goods we are to truck with them, so
      they know we can afford good pennyworths; and in the next place, it saves
      them going the whole voyage, so that the southerly monsoons yet holding,
      if they traded with us, they could immediately return with their cargo to
      China;" though, by the way, we afterwards found they intended for Japan;
      but that was all one, for by this means they saved at least eight months'
      voyage. Upon these foundations, William said he was satisfied we might
      trust them; "for," says William, "I would as soon trust a man whose
      interest binds him to be just to me as a man whose principle binds
      himself." Upon the whole, William proposed that two of the merchants
      should be left on board our ship as hostages, and that part of our goods
      should be loaded in their vessel, and let the third go with it into the
      port where their ship lay; and when he had delivered the spices, he should
      bring back such things as it was agreed should be exchanged. This was
      concluded on, and William the Quaker ventured to go along with them,
      which, upon my word, I should not have cared to have done, nor was I
      willing that he should, but he went still upon the notion that it was
      their interest to treat him friendly.
    
    
      In the meantime, we came to an anchor under a little island in the
      latitude of 23 degrees 28 minutes, being just under the northern tropic,
      and about twenty leagues from the island. Here we lay thirteen days, and
      began to be very uneasy for my friend William, for they had promised to be
      back again in four days, which they might very easily have done. However,
      at the end of thirteen days, we saw three sail coming directly to us,
      which a little surprised us all at first, not knowing what might be the
      case; and we began to put ourselves in a posture of defence; but as they
      came nearer us, we were soon satisfied, for the first vessel was that
      which William went in, who carried a flag of truce; and in a few hours
      they all came to an anchor, and William came on board us with a little
      boat, with the Chinese merchant in his company, and two other merchants,
      who seemed to be a kind of brokers for the rest.
    
    
      Here he gave us an account how civilly he had been used; how they had
      treated him with all imaginable frankness and openness; that they had not
      only given him the full value of his spices and other goods which he
      carried, in gold, by good weight, but had loaded the vessel again with
      such goods as he knew we were willing to trade for; and that afterwards
      they had resolved to bring the great ship out of the harbour, to lie where
      we were, that so we might make what bargain we thought fit; only William
      said he had promised, in our name, that we should use no violence with
      them, nor detain any of the vessels after we had done trading with them. I
      told him we would strive to outdo them in civility, and that we would make
      good every part of his agreement; in token whereof, I caused a white flag
      likewise to be spread at the poop of our great ship, which was the signal
      agreed on.
    
    
      As to the third vessel which came with them, it was a kind of bark of the
      country, who, having intelligence of our design to traffic, came off to
      deal with us, bringing a great deal of gold and some provisions, which at
      that time we were very glad of.
    
    
      In short, we traded upon the high seas with these men, and indeed we made
      a very good market, and yet sold thieves' pennyworths too. We sold here
      about sixty ton of spice, chiefly cloves and nutmegs, and above two
      hundred bales of European goods, such as linen and woollen manufactures.
      We considered we should have occasion for some such things ourselves, and
      so we kept a good quantity of English stuffs, cloth, baize,      c., for
      ourselves. I shall not take up any of the little room I have left here
      with the further particulars of our trade; it is enough to mention, that,
      except a parcel of tea, and twelve bales of fine China wrought silks, we
      took nothing in exchange for our goods but gold; so that the sum we took
      here in that glittering commodity amounted to above fifty thousand ounces
      good weight.
    
    
      When we had finished our barter, we restored the hostages, and gave the
      three merchants about the quantity of twelve hundredweight of nutmegs, and
      as many of cloves, with a handsome present of European linen and stuff for
      themselves, as a recompense for what we had taken from them; so we sent
      them away exceedingly well satisfied.
    
    
      Here it was that William gave me an account, that while he was on board
      the Japanese vessel, he met with a kind of religious, or Japan priest, who
      spoke some words of English to him; and, being very inquisitive to know
      how he came to learn any of those words, he told him that there was in his
      country thirteen Englishmen; he called them Englishmen very articulately
      and distinctly, for he had conversed with them very frequently and freely.
      He said that they were all that were left of two-and-thirty men, who came
      on shore on the north side of Japan, being driven upon a great rock in a
      stormy night, where they lost their ship, and the rest of their men were
      drowned; that he had persuaded the king of his country to send boats off
      to the rock or island where the ship was lost, to save the rest of the
      men, and to bring them on shore, which was done, and they were used very
      kindly, and had houses built for them, and land given them to plant for
      provision; and that they lived by themselves.
    
    
      He said he went frequently among them, to persuade them to worship their
      god (an idol, I suppose, of their own making), which, he said, they
      ungratefully refused; and that therefore the king had once or twice
      ordered them all to be put to death; but that, as he said, he had
      prevailed upon the king to spare them, and let them live their own way, as
      long as they were quiet and peaceable, and did not go about to withdraw
      others from the worship of the country.
    
    
      I asked William why he did not inquire from whence they came. "I did,"
      said William; "for how could I but think it strange," said he, "to hear
      him talk of Englishmen on the north side of Japan?" "Well," said I, "what
      account did he give of it?" "An account," said William, "that will
      surprise thee, and all the world after thee, that shall hear of it, and
      which makes me wish thou wouldst go up to Japan and find them out." "What
      do you mean?" said I. "Whence could they come?" "Why," says William, "he
      pulled out a little book, and in it a piece of paper, where it was
      written, in an Englishman's hand, and in plain English words, thus; and,"
      says William, "I read it myself:       'We came from Greenland, and from
      the North Pole.'" This, indeed, was amazing to us all, and more so to
      those seamen among us who knew anything of the infinite attempts which had
      been made from Europe, as well by the English as the Dutch, to discover a
      passage that way into those parts of the world; and as William pressed as
      earnestly to go on to the north to rescue those poor men, so the ship's
      company began to incline to it; and, in a word, we all came to this, that
      we would stand in to the shore of Formosa, to find this priest again, and
      have a further account of it all from him. Accordingly, the sloop went
      over; but when they came there, the vessels were very unhappily sailed,
      and this put an end to our inquiry after them, and perhaps may have
      disappointed mankind of one of the most noble discoveries that ever was
      made, or will again be made, in the world, for the good of mankind in
      general; but so much for that.
    
    
      William was so uneasy at losing this opportunity, that he pressed us
      earnestly to go up to Japan to find out these men. He told us that if it
      was nothing but to recover thirteen honest poor men from a kind of
      captivity, which they would otherwise never be redeemed from, and where,
      perhaps, they might, some time or other, be murdered by the barbarous
      people, in defence of their idolatry, it were very well worth our while,
      and it would be, in some measure, making amends for the mischiefs we had
      done in the world; but we, that had no concern upon us for the mischiefs
      we had done, had much less about any satisfactions to be made for it, so
      he found that kind of discourse would weigh very little with us. Then he
      pressed us very earnestly to let him have the sloop to go by himself, and
      I told him I would not oppose it; but when he came to the sloop none of
      the men would go with him; for the case was plain, they had all a share in
      the cargo of the great ship, as well as in thae of the sloop, and the
      richness of the cargo was such that they would not leave it by any means;
      so poor William, much to his mortification, was obliged to give it over.
      What became of those thirteen men, or whether they are not there still, I
      can give no account of.
    
    
      We are now at the end of our cruise; what we had taken was indeed so
      considerable, that it was not only enough to satisfy the most covetous and
      the most ambitious minds in the world, but it did indeed satisfy us, and
      our men declared they did not desire any more. The next motion, therefore,
      was about going back, and the way by which we should perform the voyage,
      so as not to be attacked by the Dutch in the Straits of Sunda.
    
    
      We had pretty well stored ourselves here with provisions, and it being now
      near the return of the monsoons, we resolved to stand away to the
      southward; and not only to keep without the Philippine Islands, that is to
      say, to the eastward of them, but to keep on to the southward, and see if
      we could not leave not only the Moluccas, or Spice Islands, behind us, but
      even Nova Guinea and Nova Hollandia also; and so getting into the variable
      winds, to the south of the tropic of Capricorn, steer away to the west,
      over the great Indian Ocean.
    
    
      This was indeed at first a monstrous voyage in its appearance, and the
      want of provisions threatened us. William told us in so many words, that
      it was impossible we could carry provisions enough to subsist us for such
      a voyage, and especially fresh water; and that, as there would be no land
      for us to touch at where we could get any supply, it was a madness to
      undertake it.
    
    
      But I undertook to remedy this evil, and therefore desired them not to be
      uneasy at that, for I knew that we might supply ourselves at Mindanao, the
      most southerly island of the Philippines.
    
    
      Accordingly, we set sail, having taken all the provisions here that we
      could get, the 28th of September, the wind veering a little at first from
      the N.N.W. to the N.E. by E., but afterwards settled about the N.E. and
      the E.N.E. We were nine weeks in this voyage, having met with several
      interruptions by the weather, and put in under the lee of a small island
      in the latitude of 16 degrees 12 minutes, of which we never knew the name,
      none of our charts having given any account of it: I say, we put in here
      by reason of a strange tornado or hurricane, which brought us into a great
      deal of danger. Here we rode about sixteen days, the winds being very
      tempestuous and the weather uncertain. However, we got some provisions on
      shore, such as plants and roots, and a few hogs. We believed there were
      inhabitants on the island, but we saw none of them.
    
    
      From hence, the weather settling again, we went on and came to the
      southernmost part of Mindanao, where we took in fresh water and some cows,
      but the climate was so hot that we did not attempt to salt up any more
      than so as to keep a fortnight or three weeks; and away we stood
      southward, crossing the line, and, leaving Gillolo on the starboard side,
      we coasted the country they call New Guinea, where, in the latitude of
      eight degrees south, we put in again for provisions and water, and where
      we found inhabitants; but they fled from us, and were altogether
      inconversable. From thence, sailing still southward, we left all behind us
      that any of our charts and maps took any notice of, and went on till we
      came to the latitude of seventeen degrees, the wind continuing still
      north-east.
    
    
      Here we made land to the westward, which, when we had kept in sight for
      three days, coasting along the shore for the distance of about four
      leagues, we began to fear we should find no outlet west, and so should be
      obliged to go back again, and put in among the Moluccas at last; but at
      length we found the land break off, and go trending away to the west sea,
      seeming to be all open to the south and south-west, and a great sea came
      rolling out of the south, which gave us to understand that there was no
      land for a great way.
    
    
      In a word, we kept on our course to the south, a little westerly, till we
      passed the south tropic, where we found the winds variable; and now we
      stood away fair west, and held it out for about twenty days, when we
      discovered land right ahead, and on our larboard bow; we made directly to
      the shore, being willing to take all advantages now for supplying
      ourselves with fresh provisions and water, knowing we were now entering on
      that vast unknown Indian Ocean, perhaps the greatest sea on the globe,
      having, with very little interruption of islands, a continued sea quite
      round the globe.
    
    
      We found a good road here, and some people on shore; but when we landed,
      they fled up the country, nor would they hold any correspondence with us,
      nor come near us, but shot at us several times with arrows as long as
      lances. We set up white flags for a truce, but they either did not or
      would not understand it; on the contrary, they shot our flag of truce
      through several times with their arrows, so that, in a word, we never came
      near any of them.
    
    
      We found good water here, though it was something difficult to get at it,
      but for living creatures we could see none; for the people, if they had
      any cattle, drove them all away, and showed us nothing but themselves, and
      that sometimes in a threatening posture, and in number so great, that made
      us suppose the island to be greater than we first imagined. It is true,
      they would not come near enough for us to engage with them, at least not
      openly; but they came near enough for us to see them, and, by the help of
      our glasses, to see that they were clothed and armed, but their clothes
      were only about their lower and middle parts; that they had long lances,
      half pikes, in their hands, besides bows and arrows; that they had great
      high things on their heads, made, as we believed, of feathers, and which
      looked something like our grenadiers' caps in England.
    
    
      When we saw them so shy that they would not come near us, our men began to
      range over the island, if it was such (for we never surrounded it), to
      search for cattle, and for any of the Indian plantations, for fruits or
      plants; but they soon found, to their cost, that they were to use more
      caution than that came to, and that they were to discover perfectly every
      bush and every tree before they ventured abroad in the country; for about
      fourteen of our men going farther than the rest, into a part of the
      country which seemed to be planted, as they thought, for it did but seem
      so, only I think it was overgrown with canes, such as we make our cane
      chairs with       I say, venturing too far, they were suddenly attacked
      with a shower of arrows from almost every side of them, as they thought,
      out of the tops of the trees.
    
    
      They had nothing to do but to fly for it, which, however, they could not
      resolve on, till five of them were wounded; nor had they escaped so, if
      one of them had not been so much wiser or thoughtfuller than the rest, as
      to consider, that though they could not see the enemy, so as to shoot at
      them, yet perhaps the noise of their shot might terrify them, and that
      they should rather fire at a venture. Accordingly, ten of them faced
      about, and fired at random anywhere among the canes.
    
    
      The noise and the fire not only terrified the enemy, but, as they
      believed, their shot had luckily hit some of them; for they found not only
      that the arrows, which came thick among them before, ceased, but they
      heard the Indians halloo, after their way, to one another, and make a
      strange noise, more uncouth and inimitably strange than any they had ever
      heard, more like the howling and barking of wild creatures in the woods
      than like the voice of men, only that sometimes they seemed to speak
      words.
    
    
      They observed also, that this noise of the Indians went farther and
      farther off, so that they were satisfied the Indians fled away, except on
      one side, where they heard a doleful groaning and howling, and where it
      continued a good while, which they supposed was from some or other of them
      being wounded, and howling by reason of their wounds; or killed, and
      others howling over them: but our men had enough of making discoveries; so
      they did not trouble themselves to look farther, but resolved to take this
      opportunity to retreat. But the worst of their adventure was to come; for
      as they came back, they passed by a prodigious great trunk of an old tree;
      what tree it was, they said, they did not know, but it stood like an old
      decayed oak in a park, where the keepers in England take a stand, as they
      call it, to shoot a deer; and it stood just under the steep side of a
      great rock, or hill, that our people could not see what was beyond it.
    
    
      As they came by this tree, they were of a sudden shot at, from the top of
      the tree, with seven arrows and three lances, which, to our great grief,
      killed two of our men, and wounded three more. This was the more
      surprising, because, being without any defence, and so near the trees,
      they expected more lances and arrows every moment; nor would flying do
      them any service, the Indians being, as appeared, very good marksmen. In
      this extremity, they had happily this presence of mind, viz., to run close
      to the tree, and stand, as it were, under it; so that those above could
      not come at, or see them, to throw their lances at them. This succeeded,
      and gave them time to consider what to do; they knew their enemies and
      murderers were above; they heard them talk, and those above knew those
      were below; but they below were obliged to keep close for fear of their
      lances from above. At length, one of our men, looking a little more
      strictly than the rest, thought he saw the head of one of the Indians just
      over a dead limb of the tree, which, it seems, the creature sat upon. One
      man immediately fired, and levelled his piece so true that the shot went
      through the fellow's head; and down he fell out of the tree immediately,
      and came upon the ground with such force, with the height of his fall,
      that if he had not been killed with the shot, he would certainly have been
      killed with dashing his body against the ground.
    
    
      This so frightened them, that, besides the howling noise they made in the
      tree, our men heard a strange clutter of them in the body of the tree,
      from whence they concluded they had made the tree hollow, and were got to
      hide themselves there. Now, had this been the case, they were secure
      enough from our men, for it was impossible any of our men could get up the
      tree on the outside, there being no branches to climb by; and, to shoot at
      the tree, that they tried several times to no purpose, for the tree was so
      thick that no shot would enter it. They made no doubt, however, but that
      they had their enemies in a trap, and that a small siege would either
      bring them down, tree and all, or starve them out; so they resolved to
      keep their post, and send to us for help. Accordingly, two of them came
      away to us for more hands, and particularly desired that some of our
      carpenters might come with tools, to help to cut down the tree, or at
      least to cut down other wood and set fire to it; and that, they concluded,
      would not fail to bring them out.
    
    
      Accordingly, our men went like a little army, and with mighty preparations
      for an enterprise, the like of which has scarce been ever heard, to form
      the siege of a great tree. However, when they came there, they found the
      task difficult enough, for the old trunk was indeed a very great one, and
      very tall, being at least two-and-twenty feet high, with seven old limbs
      standing out every way from the top, but decayed, and very few leaves, if
      any, left on it.
    
    
      William the Quaker, whose curiosity led him to go among the rest, proposed
      that they should make a ladder, and get upon the top, and then throw
      wild-fire into the tree, and smoke them out. Others proposed going back,
      and getting a great gun out of the ship, which would split the tree in
      pieces with the iron bullets; others, that they should cut down a great
      deal of wood, and pile it up round the tree, and set it on fire, and burn
      the tree, and the Indians in it.
    
    
      These consultations took up our people no less than two or three days, in
      all which time they heard nothing of the supposed garrison within this
      wooden castle, nor any noise within. William's project was first gone
      about, and a large strong ladder was made, to scale this wooden tower; and
      in two or three hours' time it would have been ready to mount, when, on a
      sudden, they heard the noise of the Indians in the body of the tree again,
      and a little after, several of them appeared at the top of the tree, and
      threw some lances down at our men; one of which struck one of our seamen
      a-top of the shoulder, and gave him such a desperate wound, that the
      surgeons not only had a great deal of difficulty to cure him, but the poor
      man endured such horrible torture, that we all said they had better have
      killed him outright. However, he was cured at last, though he never
      recovered the perfect use of his arm, the lance having cut some of the
      tendons on the top of the arm, near the shoulder, which, as I supposed,
      performed the office of motion to the limb before; so that the poor man
      was a cripple all the days of his life. But to return to the desperate
      rogues in the tree; our men shot at them, but did not find they had hit
      them, or any of them; but as soon as ever they shot at them, they could
      hear them huddle down into the trunk of the tree again, and there, to be
      sure, they were safe.
    
    
      Well, however, it was this which put by the project of William's ladder;
      for when it was done, who would venture up among such a troop of bold
      creatures as were there, and who, they supposed, were desperate by their
      circumstances? And as but one man at a time could go up, they began to
      think it would not do; and, indeed, I was of the opinion (for about this
      time I was come to their assistance) that going up the ladder would not
      do, unless it was thus, that a man should, as it were, run just up to the
      top, and throw some fireworks into the tree, and come down again; and this
      we did two or three times, but found no effect of it. At last, one of our
      gunners made a stink-pot, as we called it, being a composition which only
      smokes, but does not flame or burn; but withal the smoke of it is so
      thick, and the smell of it so intolerably nauseous, that it is not to be
      suffered. This he threw into the tree himself, and we waited for the
      effect of it, but heard or saw nothing all that night or the next day; so
      we concluded the men within were all smothered; when, on a sudden, the
      next night we heard them upon the top of the tree again shouting and
      hallooing like madmen.
    
    
      We concluded, as anybody would, that this was to call for help, and we
      resolved to continue our siege; for we were all enraged to see ourselves
      so baulked by a few wild people, whom we thought we had safe in our
      clutches; and, indeed, never were there so many concurring circumstances
      to delude men in any case we had met with. We resolved, however, to try
      another stink-pot the next night, and our engineer and gunner had got it
      ready, when, hearing a noise of the enemy on the top of the tree, and in
      the body of the tree, I was not willing to let the gunner go up the
      ladder, which, I said, would be but to be certain of being murdered.
      However, he found a medium for it, and that was to go up a few steps, and,
      with a long pole in his hand, to throw it in upon the top of the tree, the
      ladder being standing all this while against the top of the tree; but when
      the gunner, with his machine at the top of his pole, came to the tree,
      with three other men to help him, behold the ladder was gone.
    
    
      This perfectly confounded us; and we now concluded the Indians in the tree
      had, by this piece of negligence, taken the opportunity, and come all down
      the ladder, made their escape, and had carried away the ladder with them.
      I laughed most heartily at my friend William, who, as I said, had the
      direction of the siege, and had set up a ladder for the garrison, as we
      called them, to get down upon, and run away. But when daylight came, we
      were all set to rights again; for there stood our ladder, hauled up on the
      top of the tree, with about half of it in the hollow of the tree, and the
      other half upright in the air. Then we began to laugh at the Indians for
      fools, that they could not as well have found their way down by the
      ladder, and have made their escape, as to have pulled it up by main
      strength into the tree.
    
    
      We then resolved upon fire, and so to put an end to the work at once, and
      burn the tree and its inhabitants together; and accordingly we went to
      work to cut wood, and in a few hours' time we got enough, as we thought,
      together; and, piling it up round the bottom of the tree, we set it on
      fire, waiting at a distance to see when, the gentlemen's quarters being
      too hot for them, they would come flying out at the top. But we were quite
      confounded when, on a sudden, we found the fire all put out by a great
      quantity of water thrown upon it. We then thought the devil must be in
      them, to be sure. Says William, "This is certainly the cunningest piece of
      Indian engineering that ever was heard of; and there can be but one thing
      more to guess at, besides witchcraft and dealing with the devil, which I
      believe not one word of," says he; "and that must be, that this is an
      artificial tree, or a natural tree artificially made hollow down into the
      earth, through root and all; and that these creatures have an artificial
      cavity underneath it, quite into the hill, or a way to go through, and
      under the hill, to some other place; and where that other place is, we
      know not; but if it be not our own fault, I'll find the place, and follow
      them into it, before I am two days older." He then called the carpenters,
      to know of them if they had any large saws that would cut through the
      body; and they told him they had no saws that were long enough, nor could
      men work into such a monstrous old stump in a great while; but that they
      would go to work with it with their axes, and undertake to cut it down in
      two days, and stock up the root of it in two more. But William was for
      another way, which proved much better than all this; for he was for silent
      work, that, if possible, he might catch some of the fellows in it. So he
      sets twelve men to it with large augers, to bore great holes into the side
      of the tree, to go almost through, but not quite through; which holes were
      bored without noise, and when they were done he filled them all with
      gunpowder, stopping strong plugs, bolted crossways, into the holes, and
      then boring a slanting hole, of a less size, down into the greater hole,
      all of which were filled with powder, and at once blown up. When they took
      fire, they made such a noise, and tore and split up the tree in so many
      places, and in such a manner, that we could see plainly such another blast
      would demolish it; and so it did. Thus at the second time we could, at two
      or three places, put our hands in them, and discovered a cheat, namely,
      that there was a cave or hole dug into the earth, from or through the
      bottom of the hollow, and that it had communication with another cave
      farther in, where we heard the voices of several of the wild folks,
      calling and talking to one another.
    
    
      When we came thus far we had a great mind to get at them; and William
      desired that three men might be given him with hand-grenadoes; and he
      promised to go down first, and boldly he did so; for William, to give him
      his due, had the heart of a lion.
    
    
      They had pistols in their hands, and swords by their sides; but, as they
      had taught the Indians before by their stink-pots, the Indians returned
      them in their own kind; for they made such a smoke come up out of the
      entrance into the cave or hollow, that William and his three men were glad
      to come running out of the cave, and out of the tree too, for mere want of
      breath; and indeed they were almost stifled.
    
    
      Never was a fortification so well defended, or assailants so many ways
      defeated. We were now for giving it over, and particularly I called
      William, and told him I could not but laugh to see us spinning out our
      time here for nothing; that I could not imagine what we were doing; that
      it was certain that the rogues that were in it were cunning to the last
      degree, and it would vex anybody to be so baulked by a few naked ignorant
      fellows; but still it was not worth our while to push it any further, nor
      was there anything that I knew of to be got by the conquest when it was
      made, so that I thought it high time to give it over.
    
    
      William acknowledged what I said was just, and that there was nothing but
      our curiosity to be gratified in this attempt; and though, as he said, he
      was very desirous to have searched into the thing, yet he would not insist
      upon it; so we resolved to quit it and come away, which we did. However,
      William said before we went he would have this satisfaction of them, viz.,
      to burn down the tree and stop up the entrance into the cave. And while
      doing this the gunner told him he would have one satisfaction of the
      rogues; and this was, that he would make a mine of it, and see which way
      it had vent. Upon this he fetched two barrels of powder out of the ships,
      and placed them in the inside of the hollow of the cave, as far in as he
      durst go to carry them, and then filling up the mouth of the cave where
      the tree stood, and ramming it sufficiently hard, leaving only a pipe or
      touch-hole, he gave fire to it, and stood at a distance to see which way
      it would operate, when on a sudden he found the force of the powder burst
      its way out among some bushes on the other side the little hill I
      mentioned, and that it came roaring out there as out of the mouth of a
      cannon. Immediately running thither, we saw the effects of the powder.
    
    
      First, we saw that there was the other mouth of the cave, which the powder
      had so torn and opened, that the loose earth was so fallen in again that
      nothing of shape could be discerned; but there we saw what was become of
      the garrison of the Indians, too, who had given us all this trouble, for
      some of them had no arms, some no legs, some no head; some lay half buried
      in the rubbish of the mine       that is to say, in the loose earth that
      fell in; and, in short, there was a miserable havoc made in them all; for
      we had good reason to believe not one of them that were in the inside
      could escape, but rather were shot out of the mouth of the cave, like a
      bullet out of a gun.
    
    
      We had now our full satisfaction of the Indians; but, in short, this was a
      losing voyage, for we had two men killed, one quite crippled, and five
      more wounded; we spent two barrels of powder, and eleven days' time, and
      all to get the understanding how to make an Indian mine, or how to keep
      garrison in a hollow tree; and with this wit, bought at this dear price,
      we came away, having taken in some fresh water, but got no fresh
      provisions.
    
    
      We then considered what we should do to get back again to Madagascar. We
      were much about the latitude of the Cape of Good Hope, but had such a very
      long run, and were neither sure of meeting with fair winds nor with any
      land in the way, that we knew not what to think of it. William was our
      last resort in this case again, and he was very plain with us. "Friend,"
      says he to Captain Wilmot, "what occasion hast thou to run the venture of
      starving, merely for the pleasure of saying thou hast been where nobody
      has been before? There are a great many places nearer home, of which thou
      mayest say the same thing at less expense. I see no occasion thou hast of
      keeping thus far south any longer than till you are sure you are to the
      west end of Java and Sumatra; and then thou mayest stand away north
      towards Ceylon, and the coast of Coromandel and Madras, where thou mayest
      get both fresh water and fresh provisions; and to that part it is likely
      we may hold out well enough with the stores we have already."
    
    
      This was wholesome advice, and such as was not to be slighted; so we stood
      away to the west, keeping between the latitude of 31 and 35, and had very
      good weather and fair winds for about ten days' sail; by which time, by
      our reckoning, we were clear of the isles, and might run away to the
      north; and if we did not fall in with Ceylon, we should at least go into
      the great deep Bay of Bengal.
    
    
      But we were out in our reckoning a great deal; for, when we had stood due
      north for about fifteen or sixteen degrees, we met with land again on our
      starboard bow, about three leagues' distance; so we came to an anchor
      about half a league from it, and manned out our boats to see what sort of
      a country it was. We found it a very good one; fresh water easy to come
      at, but no cattle that we could see, or inhabitants; and we were very shy
      of searching too far after them, lest we should make such another journey
      as we did last; so that we let rambling alone, and chose rather to take
      what we could find, which was only a few wild mangoes, and some plants of
      several kinds, which we knew not the names of.
    
    
      We made no stay here, but put to sea again, N.W. by N., but had little
      wind for a fortnight more, when we made land again; and standing in with
      the shore, we were surprised to find ourselves on the south shore of Java;
      and just as we were coming to an anchor we saw a boat, carrying Dutch
      colours, sailing along-shore. We were not solicitous to speak with them,
      or any other of their nation, but left it indifferent to our people, when
      they went on shore, to see the Dutchmen or not to see them; our business
      was to get provisions, which, indeed, by this time were very short with
      us.
    
    
      We resolved to go on shore with our boats in the most convenient place we
      could find, and to look out a proper harbour to bring the ship into,
      leaving it to our fate whether we should meet with friends or enemies;
      resolving, however, not to stay any considerable time, at least not long
      enough to have expresses sent across the island to Batavia, and for ships
      to come round from thence to attack us.
    
    
      We found, according to our desire, a very good harbour, where we rode in
      seven fathom water, well defended from the weather, whatever might happen;
      and here we got fresh provisions, such as good hogs and some cows; and
      that we might lay in a little store, we killed sixteen cows, and pickled
      and barrelled up the flesh as well as we could be supposed to do in the
      latitude of eight degrees from the line.
    
    
      We did all this in about five days, and filled our casks with water; and
      the last boat was coming off with herbs and roots, we being unmoored, and
      our fore-topsail loose for sailing, when we spied a large ship to the
      northward, bearing down directly upon us. We knew not what she might be,
      but concluded the worst, and made all possible haste to get our anchor up,
      and get under sail, that we might be in a readiness to see what she had to
      say to us, for we were under no great concern for one ship, but our notion
      was, that we should be attacked by three or four together.
    
    
      By the time we had got up our anchor and the boat was stowed, the ship was
      within a league of us, and, as we thought, bore down to engage us; so we
      spread our black flag, or ancient, on the poop, and the bloody flag at the
      top-mast-head, and having made a clear ship, we stretched away to the
      westward, to get the wind of him.
    
    
      They had, it seems, quite mistaken us before, expecting nothing of an
      enemy or a pirate in those seas; and, not doubting but we had been one of
      their own ships, they seemed to be in some confusion when they found their
      mistake, so they immediately hauled upon a wind on the other tack, and
      stood edging in for the shore, towards the easternmost part of the island.
      Upon this we tacked, and stood after him with all the sail we could, and
      in two hours came almost within gunshot. Though they crowded all the sail
      they could lay on, there was no remedy but to engage us, and they soon saw
      their inequality of force. We fired a gun for them to bring to; so they
      manned out their boat, and sent to us with a flag of truce. We sent back
      the boat, but with this answer to the captain, that he had nothing to do
      but to strike and bring his ship to an anchor under our stern, and come on
      board us himself, when he should know our demands; but that, however,
      since he had not yet put us to the trouble of forcing him, which we saw we
      were able to do, we assured them that the captain should return again in
      safety, and all his men, and that, supplying us with such things as we
      should demand, his ship should not be plundered. They went back with this
      message, and it was some time after they were on board before they struck,
      which made us begin to think they refused it; so we fired a shot, and in a
      few minutes more we perceived their boat put off; and as soon as the boat
      put off the ship struck and came to an anchor, as was directed.
    
    
      When the captain came on board, we demanded an account of their cargo,
      which was chiefly bales of goods from Bengal for Bantam. We told them our
      present want was provisions, which they had no need of, being just at the
      end of their voyage; and that, if they would send their boat on shore with
      ours, and procure us six-and-twenty head of black cattle, threescore hogs,
      a quantity of brandy and arrack, and three hundred bushels of rice, we
      would let them go free.
    
    
      As to the rice, they gave us six hundred bushels, which they had actually
      on board, together with a parcel shipped upon freight. Also, they gave us
      thirty middling casks of very good arrack, but beef and pork they had
      none. However, they went on shore with our men, and bought eleven bullocks
      and fifty hogs, which were pickled up for our occasion; and upon the
      supplies of provision from shore, we dismissed them and their ship.
    
    
      We lay here several days before we could furnish ourselves with the
      provisions agreed for, and some of the men fancied the Dutchmen were
      contriving our destruction; but they were very honest, and did what they
      could to furnish the black cattle, but found it impossible to supply so
      many. So they came and told us ingenuously, that, unless we could stay a
      while longer, they could get no more oxen or cows than those eleven, with
      which we were obliged to be satisfied, taking the value of them in other
      things, rather than stay longer there. On our side, we were punctual with
      them in observing the conditions we had agreed on; nor would we let any of
      our men so much as go on board them, or suffer any of their men to come on
      board us; for, had any of our men gone on board, nobody could have
      answered for their behaviour, any more than if they had been on shore in
      an enemy's country.
    
    
      We were now victualled for our voyage; and, as we mattered not purchase,
      we went merrily on for the coast of Ceylon, where we intended to touch, to
      get fresh water again, and more provisions; and we had nothing material
      offered in this part of the voyage, only that we met with contrary winds,
      and were above a month in the passage.
    
    
      We put in upon the south coast of the island, desiring to have as little
      to do with the Dutch as we could; and as the Dutch were lords of the
      country as to commerce, so they are more so of the sea-coast, where they
      have several forts, and, in particular, have all the cinnamon, which is
      the trade of that island.
    
    
      We took in fresh water here, and some provisions, but did not much trouble
      ourselves about laying in any stores, our beef and hogs, which we got at
      Java, being not yet all gone by a good deal. We had a little skirmish on
      shore here with some of the people of the island, some of our men having
      been a little too familiar with the homely ladies of the country; for
      homely, indeed, they were, to such a degree, that if our men had not had
      good stomachs that way, they would scarce have touched any of them.
    
    
      I could never fully get it out of our men what they did, they were so true
      to one another in their wickedness, but I understood in the main, that it
      was some barbarous thing they had done, and that they had like to have
      paid dear for it, for the men resented it to the last degree, and gathered
      in such numbers about them, that, had not sixteen more of our men, in
      another boat, come all in the nick of time, just to rescue our first men,
      who were but eleven, and so fetch them off by main force, they had been
      all cut off, the inhabitants being no less than two or three hundred,
      armed with darts and lances, the usual weapons of the country, and which
      they are very dexterous at the throwing, even so dexterous that it was
      scarce credible; and had our men stood to fight them, as some of them were
      bold enough to talk of, they had been all overwhelmed and killed. As it
      was, seventeen of our men were wounded, and some of them very dangerously.
      But they were more frighted than hurt too, for every one of them gave
      themselves over for dead men, believing the lances were poisoned. But
      William was our comfort here too; for, when two of our surgeons were of
      the same opinion, and told the men foolishly enough that they would die,
      William cheerfully went to work with them, and cured them all but one, who
      rather died by drinking some arrack punch than of his wound; the excess of
      drinking throwing him into a fever.
    
    
      We had enough of Ceylon, though some of our people were for going ashore
      again, sixty or seventy men together, to be revenged; but William
      persuaded them against it; and his reputation was so great among the men,
      as well as with us that were commanders, that he could influence them more
      than any of us.
    
    
      They were mighty warm upon their revenge, and they would go on shore, and
      destroy five hundred of them. "Well," says William, "and suppose you do,
      what are you the better?" "Why, then," says one of them, speaking for the
      rest, "we shall have our satisfaction." "Well, and what will you be the
      better for that?" says William. They could then say nothing to that.
      "Then," says William, "if I mistake not, your business is money; now, I
      desire to know, if you conquer and kill two or three thousand of these
      poor creatures, they have no money, pray what will you get? They are poor
      naked wretches; what shall you gain by them? But then," says William,
      "perhaps, in doing this, you may chance to lose half-a-score of your own
      company, as it is very probable you may. Pray, what gain is in it? and
      what account can you give the captain for his lost men?" In short, William
      argued so effectually, that he convinced them that it was mere murder to
      do so; and that the men had a right to their own, and that they had no
      right to take them away; that it was destroying innocent men, who had
      acted no otherwise than as the laws of nature dictated; and that it would
      be as much murder to do so, as to meet a man on the highway, and kill him,
      for the mere sake of it, in cold blood, not regarding whether he had done
      any wrong to us or no.
    
    
      These reasons prevailed with them at last, and they were content to go
      away, and leave them as they found them. In the first skirmish they killed
      between sixty and seventy men, and wounded a great many more; but they had
      nothing, and our people got nothing by it, but the loss of one man's life,
      and the wounding sixteen more, as above.
    
    
      But another accident brought us to a necessity of further business with
      these people, and indeed we had like to have put an end to our lives and
      adventures all at once among them; for, about three days after our putting
      out to sea from the place where we had that skirmish, we were attacked by
      a violent storm of wind from the south, or rather a hurricane of wind from
      all the points southward, for it blew in a most desperate and furious
      manner from the S.E. to the S.W., one minute at one point, and then
      instantly turning about again to another point, but with the same
      violence; nor were we able to work the ship in that condition, so that the
      ship I was in split three top-sails, and at last brought the main-top-mast
      by the board; and, in a word, we were once or twice driven right ashore;
      and one time, had not the wind shifted the very moment it did, we had been
      dashed in a thousand pieces upon a great ledge of rocks which lay off
      about half-a-league from the shore; but, as I have said, the wind shifting
      very often, and at that time coming to the E.S.E., we stretched off, and
      got above a league more sea-room in half-an-hour. After that, it blew with
      some fury S.W. by S., then S.W. by W., and put us back again a great way
      to the eastward of the ledge of rocks, where we found a great opening
      between the rocks and the land, and endeavoured to come to an anchor
      there, but we found there was no ground fit to anchor in, and that we
      should lose our anchors, there being nothing but rocks. We stood through
      the opening, which held about four leagues. The storm continued, and now
      we found a dreadful foul shore, and knew not what course to take. We
      looked out very narrowly for some river or creek or bay, where we might
      run in, and come to an anchor, but found none a great while. At length we
      saw a great headland lie out far south into the sea, and that to such a
      length, that, in short, we saw plainly that, if the wind held where it
      was, we could not weather it, so we ran in as much under the lee of the
      point as we could, and came to an anchor in about twelve fathom water.
    
    
      But the wind veering again in the night, and blowing exceedingly hard, our
      anchors came home, and the ship drove till the rudder struck against the
      ground; and had the ship gone half her length farther she had been lost,
      and every one of us with her. But our sheet-anchor held its own, and we
      heaved in some of the cable, to get clear of the ground we had struck
      upon. It was by this only cable that we rode it out all night; and towards
      morning we thought the wind abated a little; and it was well for us that
      it was so, for, in spite of what our sheet-anchor did for us, we found the
      ship fast aground in the morning, to our very great surprise and
      amazement.
    
    
      When the tide was out, though the water here ebbed away, the ship lay
      almost dry upon a bank of hard sand, which never, I suppose, had any ship
      upon it before. The people of the country came down in great numbers to
      look at us and gaze, not knowing what we were, but gaping at us as at a
      great sight or wonder at which they were surprised, and knew not what to
      do.
    
    
      I have reason to believe that upon the sight they immediately sent an
      account of a ship being there, and of the condition we were in, for the
      next day there appeared a great man; whether it was their king or no I
      know not, but he had abundance of men with him, and some with long
      javelins in their hands as long as half-pikes; and these came all down to
      the water's edge, and drew up in a very good order, just in our view. They
      stood near an hour without making any motion; and then there came near
      twenty of them, with a man before them carrying a white flag. They came
      forward into the water as high as their waists, the sea not going so high
      as before, for the wind was abated, and blew off the shore.
    
    
      The man made a long oration to us, as we could see by his gestures; and we
      sometimes heard his voice, but knew not one word he said. William, who was
      always useful to us, I believe was here again the saving of all our lives.
      The case was this: The fellow, or what I might call him, when his speech
      was done, gave three great screams (for I know not what else to say they
      were), then lowered his white flag three times, and then made three
      motions to us with his arm to come to him.
    
    
      I acknowledge that I was for manning out the boat and going to them, but
      William would by no means allow me. He told me we ought to trust nobody;
      that, if they were barbarians, and under their own government, we might be
      sure to be all murdered; and, if they were Christians, we should not fare
      much better, if they knew who we were; that it was the custom of the
      Malabars to betray all people that they could get into their hands, and
      that these were some of the same people; and that, if we had any regard to
      our own safety, we should not go to them by any means. I opposed him a
      great while, and told him I thought he used to be always right, but that
      now I thought he was not; that I was no more for running needless risks
      than he or any one else; but I thought all nations in the world, even the
      most savage people, when they held out a flag of peace, kept the offer of
      peace made by that signal very sacredly; and I gave him several examples
      of it in the history of my African travels, which I have here gone through
      in the beginning of this work, and that I could not think these people
      worse than some of them. And, besides, I told him our case seemed to be
      such that we must fall into somebody's hands or other, and that we had
      better fall into their hands by a friendly treaty than by a forced
      submission, nay, though they had indeed a treacherous design; and
      therefore I was for a parley with them.
    
    
      "Well, friend," says William very gravely, "if thou wilt go I cannot help
      it; I shall only desire to take my last leave of thee at parting, for,
      depend upon it, thou wilt never see us again. Whether we in the ship may
      come off any better at last I cannot resolve thee; but this I will answer
      for, that we will not give up our lives idly, and in cool blood, as thou
      art going to do; we will at least preserve ourselves as long as we can,
      and die at last like men, not like fools, trepanned by the wiles of a few
      barbarians."
    
    
      William spoke this with so much warmth, and yet with so much assurance of
      our fate, that I began to think a little of the risk I was going to run. I
      had no more mind to be murdered than he; and yet I could not for my life
      be so faint-hearted in the thing as he. Upon which I asked him if he had
      any knowledge of the place, or had ever been there. He said, No. Then I
      asked him if he had heard or read anything about the people of this
      island, and of their way of treating any Christians that had fallen into
      their hands; and he told me he had heard of one, and he would tell me the
      story afterward. His name, he said, was Knox, commander of an East India
      ship, who was driven on shore, just as we were, upon this island of
      Ceylon, though he could not say it was at the same place, or whereabouts;
      that he was beguiled by the barbarians, and enticed to come on shore, just
      as we were invited to do at that time; and that, when they had him, they
      surrounded him, and eighteen or twenty of his men, and never suffered them
      to return, but kept them prisoners, or murdered them, he could not tell
      which; but they were carried away up into the country, separated from one
      another, and never heard of afterwards, except the captain's son, who
      miraculously made his escape, after twenty years' slavery.
    
    
      I had no time then to ask him to give the full story of this Knox, much
      less to hear him tell it me; but, as it is usual in such cases, when one
      begins to be a little touched, I turned short with him. "Why then, friend
      William," said I, "what would you have us do? You see what condition we
      are in, and what is before us; something must be done, and that
      immediately." "Why," says William, "I'll tell thee what thou shalt do;
      first, cause a white flag to be hanged out, as they do to us, and man out
      the longboat and pinnace with as many men as they can well stow, to handle
      their arms, and let me go with them, and thou shalt see what we will do.
      If I miscarry, thou mayest be safe; and I will also tell thee, that if I
      do miscarry, it shall be my own fault, and thou shalt learn wit by my
      folly."
    
    
      I knew not what to reply to him at first; but, after some pause, I said,
      "William, William, I am as both you should be lost as you are that I
      should; and if there be any danger, I desire you may no more fall into it
      than I. Therefore, if you will, let us all keep in the ship, fare alike,
      and take our fate together."
    
    
      "No, no," says William, "there's no danger in the method I propose; thou
      shalt go with me, if thou thinkest fit. If thou pleasest but to follow the
      measures that I shall resolve on, depend upon it, though we will go off
      from the ships, we will not a man of us go any nearer them than within
      call to talk with them. Thou seest they have no boats to come off to us;
      but," says he, "I rather desire thou wouldst take my advice, and manage
      the ships as I shall give the signal from the boat, and let us concert
      that matter together before we go off."
    
    
      Well, I found William had his measures in his head all laid beforehand,
      and was not at a loss what to do at all; so I told him he should be
      captain for this voyage, and we would be all of us under his orders, which
      I would see observed to a tittle.
    
    
      Upon this conclusion of our debates, he ordered four-and-twenty men into
      the long-boat, and twelve men into the pinnace, and the sea being now
      pretty smooth, they went off, being all very well armed. Also he ordered
      that all the guns of the great ship, on the side which lay next the shore,
      should be loaded with musket-balls, old nails, stubs, and such-like pieces
      of old iron, lead, and anything that came to hand; and that we should
      prepare to fire as soon as ever we saw them lower the white flag and hoist
      up a red one in the pinnace.
    
    
      With these measures fixed between us, they went off towards the shore,
      William in the pinnace with twelve men, and the long-boat coming after him
      with four-and-twenty more, all stout resolute fellows, and very well
      armed. They rowed so near the shore as that they might speak to one
      another, carrying a white flag, as the other did, and offering a parley.
      The brutes, for such they were, showed themselves very courteous; but
      finding we could not understand them, they fetched an old Dutchman, who
      had been their prisoner many years, and set him to speak to us. The sum
      and substance of his speech was, that the king of the country had sent his
      general down to know who we were, and what our business was. William stood
      up in the stern of the pinnace, and told him, that as to that, he, that
      was an European, by his language and voice, might easily know what we
      were, and our condition; the ship being aground upon the sand would also
      tell him that our business there was that of a ship in distress; so
      William desired to know what they came down for with such a multitude, and
      with arms and weapons, as if they came to war with us.
    
    
      He answered, they might have good reason to come down to the shore, the
      country being alarmed with the appearance of ships of strangers upon the
      coast; and as our vessels were full of men, and as we had guns and
      weapons, the king had sent part of his military men, that, in case of any
      invasion upon the country, they might be ready to defend themselves,
      whatsoever might be the occasion.
    
    
      "But," says he, "as you are men in distress, the king has ordered his
      general, who is here also, to give you all the assistance he can, and to
      invite you on shore, and receive you with all possible courtesy." Says
      William, very quick upon him, "Before I give thee an answer to that, I
      desire thee to tell me what thou art, for by thy speech thou art an
      European." He answered presently, he was a Dutchman. "That I know well,"
      says William, "by thy speech; but art thou a native Dutchman of Holland,
      or a native of this country, that has learned Dutch by conversing among
      the Hollanders, who we know are settled upon this island?"
    
    
      "No," says the old man, "I am a native of Delft, in the province of
      Holland, in Europe."
    
    
      "Well," says William, immediately, "but art thou a Christian or a heathen,
      or what we call a renegado?"
    
    
      "I am," says he, "a Christian." And so they went on, in a short dialogue,
      as follows:       
    
    
      William. Thou art a Dutchman, and a Christian, thou sayest; pray,
      art thou a freeman or a servant?
    
    
      Dutchman. I am a servant to the king here, and in his army.
    
    
      W. But art thou a volunteer, or a prisoner?
    
    
      D. Indeed I was a prisoner at first, but am at liberty now, and so
      am a volunteer.
    
    
      W. That is to say, being first a prisoner, thou hast liberty to
      serve them; but art thou so at liberty that thou mayest go away, if thou
      pleasest, to thine own countrymen?
    
    
      D. No, I do not say so; my countrymen live a great way off, on the
      north and east parts of the island, and there is no going to them without
      the king's express license.
    
    
      W. Well, and why dost thou not get a license to go away?
    
    
      D. I have never asked for it.
    
    
      W. And, I suppose, if thou didst, thou knowest thou couldst not
      obtain it.
    
    
      D. I cannot say much as to that; but why do you ask me all these
      questions?
    
    
      W. Why, my reason is good; if thou art a Christian and a prisoner,
      how canst thou consent to be made an instrument to these barbarians, to
      betray us into their hands, who are thy countrymen and fellow-Christians?
      Is it not a barbarous thing in thee to do so?
    
    
      D. How do I go about to betray you? Do I not give you an account
      how the king invites you to come on shore, and has ordered you to be
      treated courteously and assisted?
    
    
      W. As thou art a Christian, though I doubt it much, dost thou
      believe the king or the general, as thou callest it, means one word of
      what he says?
    
    
      D. He promises you by the mouth of his great general.
    
    
      W. I don't ask thee what he promises, or by whom; but I ask thee
      this: Canst thou say that thou believest he intends to perform it?
    
    
      D. How can I answer that? How can I tell what he intends?
    
    
      W. Thou canst tell what thou believest.
    
    
      D. I cannot say but he will perform it; I believe he may.
    
    
      W. Thou art but a double-tongued Christian, I doubt. Come, I'll ask
      thee another question: Wilt thou say that thou believest it, and that thou
      wouldst advise me to believe it, and put our lives into their hands upon
      these promises?
    
    
      D. I am not to be your adviser.
    
    
      W. Thou art perhaps afraid to speak thy mind, because thou art in
      their power. Pray, do any of them understand what thou and I say? Can they
      speak Dutch?
    
    
      D. No, not one of them; I have no apprehensions upon that account
      at all.
    
    
      W. Why, then, answer me plainly, if thou art a Christian: Is it
      safe for us to venture upon their words, to put ourselves into their
      hands, and come on shore?
    
    
      D. You put it very home to me. Pray let me ask you another
      question: Are you in any likelihood of getting your ship off, if you
      refuse it?
    
    
      W. Yes, yes, we shall get off the ship; now the storm is over we
      don't fear it.
    
    
      D. Then I cannot say it is best for you to trust them.
    
    
      W. Well, it is honestly said.
    
    
      D. But what shall I say to them?
    
    
      W. Give them good words, as they give us.
    
    
      D. What good words?
    
    
      W. Why, let them tell the king that we are strangers, who were
      driven on his coast by a great storm; that we thank him very kindly for
      his offer of civility to us, which, if we are further distressed, we will
      accept thankfully; but that at present we have no occasion to come on
      shore; and besides, that we cannot safely leave the ship in the present
      condition she is in; but that we are obliged to take care of her, in order
      to get her off; and expect, in a tide or two more, to get her quite clear,
      and at an anchor.
    
    
      D. But he will expect you to come on shore, then, to visit him, and
      make him some present for his civility.
    
    
      W. When we have got our ship clear, and stopped the leaks, we will
      pay our respects to him.
    
    
      D. Nay, you may as well come to him now as then.
    
    
      W. Nay, hold, friend; I did not say we would come to him then: you
      talked of making him a present, that is to pay our respects to him, is it
      not?
    
    
      D. Well, but I will tell him that you will come on shore to him
      when your ship is got off.
    
    
      W. I have nothing to say to that; you may tell him what you think
      fit.
    
    
      D. But he will be in a great rage if I do not.
    
    
      W. Who will he be in a great rage at?
    
    
      D. At you.
    
    
      W. What occasion have we to value that?
    
    
      D. Why, he will send all his army down against you.
    
    
      W. And what if they were all here just now? What dost thou suppose
      they could do to us?
    
    
      D. He would expect they should burn your ships and bring you all to
      him.
    
    
      W. Tell him, if he should try, he may catch a Tartar.
    
    
      D. He has a world of men.
    
    
      W. Has he any ships?
    
    
      D. No, he has no ships.
    
    
      W. Nor boats?
    
    
      D. No, nor boats.
    
    
      W. Why, what then do you think we care for his men? What canst thou
      do now to us, if thou hadst a hundred thousand with thee?
    
    
      D. Oh! they might set you on fire.
    
    
      W. Set us a-firing, thou meanest; that they might indeed; but set
      us on fire they shall not; they may try, at their peril, and we shall make
      mad work with your hundred thousand men, if they come within reach of our
      guns, I assure thee.
    
    
      D. But what if the king gives you hostages for your safety?
    
    
      W. Whom can he give but mere slaves and servants like thyself,
      whose lives he no more values than we an English hound?
    
    
      D. Whom do you demand for hostages?
    
    
      W. Himself and your worship.
    
    
      D. What would you do with him?
    
    
      W. Do with him as he would do with us       cut his head off.
    
    
      D. And what would you do with me?
    
    
      W. Do with thee? We would carry thee home into thine own country;
      and, though thou deservest the gallows, we would make a man and a
      Christian of thee again, and not do by thee as thou wouldst have done by
      us       betray thee to a parcel of merciless, savage pagans, that know no
      God, nor how to show mercy to man.
    
    
      D. You put a thought in my head that I will speak to you about
      to-morrow.
    
    
      Thus they went away, and William came on board, and gave us a full account
      of his parley with the old Dutchman, which was very diverting, and to me
      instructing; for I had abundance of reason to acknowledge William had made
      a better judgment of things than I.
    
    
      It was our good fortune to get our ship off that very night, and to bring
      her to an anchor at about a mile and a half farther out, and in deep
      water, to our great satisfaction; so that we had no need to fear the
      Dutchman's king, with his hundred thousand men; and indeed we had some
      sport with them the next day, when they came down, a vast prodigious
      multitude of them, very few less in number, in our imagination, than a
      hundred thousand, with some elephants; though, if it had been an army of
      elephants, they could have done us no harm; for we were fairly at our
      anchor now, and out of their reach. And indeed we thought ourselves more
      out of their reach than we really were; and it was ten thousand to one
      that we had not been fast aground again, for the wind blowing off shore,
      though it made the water smooth where we lay, yet it blew the ebb farther
      out than usual, and we could easily perceive the sand, which we touched
      upon before, lay in the shape of a half-moon, and surrounded us with two
      horns of it, so that we lay in the middle or centre of it, as in a round
      bay, safe just as we were, and in deep water, but present death, as it
      were, on the right hand and on the left, for the two horns or points of
      the sand reached out beyond where our ship lay near two miles.
    
    
      On that part of the sand which lay on our east side, this misguided
      multitude extended themselves; and being, most of them, not above their
      knees, or most of them not above ankle-deep in the water, they as it were
      surrounded us on that side, and on the side of the mainland, and a little
      way on the other side of the sand, standing in a half-circle, or rather
      three-fifths of a circle, for about six miles in length. The other horn,
      or point of the sand, which lay on our west side, being not quite so
      shallow, they could not extend themselves upon it so far.
    
    
      They little thought what service they had done us, and how unwittingly,
      and by the greatest ignorance, they had made themselves pilots to us,
      while we, having not sounded the place, might have been lost before we
      were aware. It is true we might have sounded our new harbour before we had
      ventured out, but I cannot say for certain whether we should or not; for
      I, for my part, had not the least suspicion of what our real case was;
      however, I say, perhaps, before we had weighed, we should have looked
      about us a little. I am sure we ought to have done it; for, besides these
      armies of human furies, we had a very leaky ship, and all our pumps could
      hardly keep the water from growing upon us, and our carpenters were
      overboard, working to find out and stop the wounds we had received,
      heeling her first on the one side, and then on the other; and it was very
      diverting to see how, when our men heeled the ship over to the side next
      the wild army that stood on the east horn of the sand, they were so
      amazed, between fright and joy, that it put them into a kind of confusion,
      calling to one another, hallooing and skreeking, in a manner that it is
      impossible to describe.
    
    
      While we were doing this, for we were in a great hurry you may be sure,
      and all hands at work, as well at the stopping our leaks as repairing our
      rigging and sails, which had received a great deal of damage, and also in
      rigging a new main-top-mast and the like;       I say, while we were doing
      all this, we perceived a body of men, of near a thousand, move from that
      part of the army of the barbarians that lay at the bottom of the sandy
      bay, and came all along the water's edge, round the sand, till they stood
      just on our broadside east, and were within about half-a-mile of us. Then
      we saw the Dutchman come forward nearer to us, and all alone, with his
      white flag and all his motions, just as before, and there he stood.
    
    
      Our men had but just brought the ship to rights again as they came up to
      our broadside, and we had very happily found out and stopped the worst and
      most dangerous leak that we had, to our very great satisfaction; so I
      ordered the boats to be hauled up and manned as they were the day before,
      and William to go as plenipotentiary. I would have gone myself if I had
      understood Dutch, but as I did not, it was to no purpose, for I should be
      able to know nothing of what was said but from him at second-hand, which
      might be done as well afterwards. All the instructions I pretended to give
      William was, if possible, to get the old Dutchman away, and, if he could,
      to make him come on board.
    
    
      Well, William went just as before, and when he came within about sixty or
      seventy yards of the shore, he held up his white flag as the Dutchman did,
      and turning the boat's broadside to the shore, and his men lying upon
      their oars, the parley or dialogue began again thus:       
    
    
      William. Well, friend, what dost thou say to us now?
    
    
      Dutchman. I come of the same mild errand as I did yesterday.
    
    
      W. What! dost thou pretend to come of a mild errand with all these
      people at thy back, and all the foolish weapons of war they bring with
      them? Prithee, what dost thou mean?
    
    
      D. The king hastens us to invite the captain and all his men to
      come on shore, and has ordered all his men to show them all the civility
      they can.
    
    
      W. Well, and are all those men come to invite us ashore?
    
    
      D. They will do you no hurt, if you will come on shore peaceably.
    
    
      W. Well, and what dost thou think they can do to us, if we will not?
    
    
      D. I would not have them do you any hurt then, neither.
    
    
      W. But prithee, friend, do not make thyself fool and knave too. Dost not
      thou know that we are out of fear of all thy army, and out of danger of
      all that they can do? What makes thee act so simply as well as so
      knavishly?
    
    
      D. Why, you may think yourselves safer than you are; you do not know what
      they may do to you. I can assure you they are able to do you a great deal
      of harm, and perhaps burn your ship.
    
    
      W. Suppose that were true, as I am sure it is false; you see we have more
      ships to carry us off (pointing to the sloop).
    
    
      [N.B.       Just at this time we discovered the sloop standing towards us
      from the east, along the shore, at about the distance of two leagues,
      which was to our particular satisfaction, she having been missing thirteen
      days.]
    
    
      D. We do not value that; if you had ten ships, you dare not come on shore,
      with all the men you have, in a hostile way; we are too many for you.
    
    
      W. Thou dost not, even in that, speak as thou meanest; and we may give
      thee a trial of our hands when our friends come up to us, for thou hearest
      they have discovered us.
    
    
      [Just then the sloop fired five guns, which was to get news of us, for
      they did not see us.]
    
    
      D. Yes, I hear they fire; but I hope your ship will not fire again; for,
      if they do, our general will take it for breaking the truce, and will make
      the army let fly a shower of arrows at you in the boat.
    
    
      W. Thou mayest be sure the ship will fire that the other ship may hear
      them, but not with ball. If thy general knows no better, he may begin when
      he will; but thou mayest be sure we will return it to his cost.
    
    
      D. What must I do, then?
    
    
      W. Do! Why, go to him, and tell him of it beforehand, then; and let him
      know that the ship firing is not at him nor his men; and then come again,
      and tell us what he says.
    
    
      D. No; I will send to him, which will do as well.
    
    
      W. Do as thou wilt, but I believe thou hadst better go thyself; for if our
      men fire first, I suppose he will be in a great wrath, and it may be at
      thee; for, as to his wrath at us, we tell thee beforehand we value it not.
    
    
      D. You slight them too much; you know not what they may do.
    
    
      W. Thou makest as if these poor savage wretches could do mighty things:
      prithee, let us see what you can all do, we value it not; thou mayest set
      down thy flag of truce when thou pleasest, and begin.
    
    
      D. I had rather make a truce, and have you all part friends.
    
    
      W. Thou art a deceitful rogue thyself, for it is plain thou knowest these
      people would only persuade us on shore to entrap and surprise us; and yet
      thou that art a Christian, as thou callest thyself, would have us come on
      shore and put our lives into their hands who know nothing that belongs to
      compassion, good usage, or good manners. How canst thou be such a villain?
    
    
      D. How can you call me so? What have I done to you, and what would you
      have me do?
    
    
      W. Not act like a traitor, but like one that was once a Christian, and
      would have been so still, if you had not been a Dutchman.
    
    
      D. I know not what to do, not I. I wish I were from them; they are a
      bloody people.
    
    
      W. Prithee, make no difficulty of what thou shouldst do. Canst thou swim?
    
    
      D. Yes, I can swim; but if I should attempt to swim off to you, I should
      have a thousand arrows and javelins sticking in me before I should get to
      your boat.
    
    
      W. I'll bring the boat close to thee, and take thee on board in spite of
      them all. We will give them but one volley, and I'll engage they will all
      run away from thee.
    
    
      D. You are mistaken in them, I assure you; they would immediately come all
      running down to the shore, and shoot fire-arrows at you, and set your boat
      and ship and all on fire about your ears.
    
    
      W. We will venture that if thou wilt come off.
    
    
      D. Will you use me honourably when I am among you?
    
    
      W. I'll give thee my word for it, if thou provest honest.
    
    
      D. Will you not make me a prisoner?
    
    
      W. I will be thy surety, body for body, that thou shalt be a free man, and
      go whither thou wilt, though I own to thee thou dost not deserve it.
    
    
      Just at this time our ship fired three guns to answer the sloop and let
      her know we saw her, who immediately, we perceived, understood it, and
      stood directly for the place. But it is impossible to express the
      confusion and filthy vile noise, the hurry and universal disorder, that
      was among that vast multitude of people upon our firing off three guns.
      They immediately all repaired to their arms, as I may call it; for to say
      they put themselves into order would be saying nothing.
    
    
      Upon the word of command, then, they advanced all in a body to the
      seaside, and resolving to give us one volley of their fire-arms (for such
      they were), immediately they saluted us with a hundred thousand of their
      fire-arrows, every one carrying a little bag of cloth dipped in brimstone,
      or some such thing, which, flying through the air, had nothing to hinder
      it taking fire as it flew, and it generally did so.
    
    
      I cannot say but this method of attacking us, by a way we had no notion
      of, might give us at first some little surprise, for the number was so
      great at first, that we were not altogether without apprehensions that
      they might unluckily set our ship on fire, so that William resolved
      immediately to row on board, and persuade us all to weigh and stand out to
      sea; but there was no time for it, for they immediately let fly a volley
      at the boat, and at the ship, from all parts of the vast crowd of people
      which stood near the shore. Nor did they fire, as I may call it, all at
      once, and so leave off; but their arrows being soon notched upon their
      bows, they kept continually shooting, so that the air was full of flame.
    
    
      I could not say whether they set their cotton rag on fire before they shot
      the arrow, for I did not perceive they had fire with them, which, however,
      it seems they had. The arrow, besides the fire it carried with it, had a
      head, or a peg, as we call it, of bone; and some of sharp flint stone; and
      some few of a metal, too soft in itself for metal, but hard enough to
      cause it to enter, if it were a plank, so as to stick where it fell.
    
    
      William and his men had notice sufficient to lie close behind their
      waste-boards, which, for this very purpose, they had made so high that
      they could easily sink themselves behind them, so as to defend themselves
      from anything that came point-blank (as we call it) or upon a line; but
      for what might fall perpendicularly out of the air they had no guard, but
      took the hazard of that. At first they made as if they would row away, but
      before they went they gave a volley of their fire-arms, firing at those
      which stood with the Dutchman; but William ordered them to be sure to take
      their aim at others, so as to miss him, and they did so.
    
    
      There was no calling to them now, for the noise was so great among them
      that they could hear nobody, but our men boldly rowed in nearer to them,
      for they were at first driven a little off, and when they came nearer,
      they fired a second volley, which put the fellows into great confusion,
      and we could see from the ship that several of them were killed or
      wounded.
    
    
      We thought this was a very unequal fight, and therefore we made a signal
      to our men to row away, that we might have a little of the sport as well
      as they; but the arrows flew so thick upon them, being so near the shore,
      that they could not sit to their oars, so they spread a little of their
      sail, thinking they might sail along the shore, and lie behind their
      waste-board; but the sail had not been spread six minutes till it had five
      hundred fire-arrows shot into it and through it, and at length set it
      fairly on fire; nor were our men quite out of the danger of its setting
      the boat on fire, and this made them paddle and shove the boat away as
      well as they could, as they lay, to get farther off.
    
    
      By this time they had left us a fair mark at the whole savage army; and as
      we had sheered the ship as near to them as we could, we fired among the
      thickest of them six or seven times, five guns at a time, with shot, old
      iron, musket-bullets,      c.
    
    
      We could easily see that we made havoc among them, and killed and wounded
      abundance of them, and that they were in a great surprise at it; but yet
      they never offered to stir, and all this while their fire-arrows flew as
      thick as before.
    
    
      At last, on a sudden their arrows stopped, and the old Dutchman came
      running down to the water-side all alone, with his white flag, as before,
      waving it as high as he could, and making signals to our boat to come to
      him again.
    
    
      William did not care at first to go near him, but the man continuing to
      make signals to him to come, at last William went; and the Dutchman told
      him that he had been with the general, who was much mollified by the
      slaughter of his men, and that now he could have anything of him.
    
    
      "Anything!" says William; "what have we to do with him? Let him go about
      his business, and carry his men out of gunshot, can't he?"
    
    
      "Why," says the Dutchman, "but he dares not stir, nor see the king's face;
      unless some of your men come on shore, he will certainly put him to
      death."
    
    
      "Why, then," says William, "he is a dead man; for if it were to save his
      life, and the lives of all the crowd that is with him, he shall never have
      one of us in his power. But I'll tell thee," said William, "how thou shalt
      cheat him, and gain thy own liberty too, if thou hast any mind to see thy
      own country again, and art not turned savage, and grown fond of living all
      thy days among heathens and savages."
    
    
      "I would be glad to do it with all my heart," says he; "but if I should
      offer to swim off to you now, though they are so far from me, they shoot
      so true that they would kill me before I got half-way."
    
    
      "But," says William, "I'll tell thee how thou shalt come with his consent.
      Go to him, and tell him I have offered to carry you on board, to try if
      you could persuade the captain to come on shore, and that I would not
      hinder him if he was willing to venture."
    
    
      The Dutchman seemed in a rapture at the very first word. "I'll do it,"
      says he; "I am persuaded he will give me leave to come."
    
    
      Away he runs, as if he had a glad message to carry, and tells the general
      that William had promised, if he would go on board the ship with him, he
      would persuade the captain to return with him. The general was fool enough
      to give him orders to go, and charged him not to come back without the
      captain; which he readily promised, and very honestly might.
    
    
      So they took him in, and brought him on board, and he was as good as his
      word to them, for he never went back to them any more; and the sloop being
      come to the mouth of the inlet where we lay, we weighed and set sail; but,
      as we went out, being pretty near the shore, we fired three guns, as it
      were among them, but without any shot, for it was of no use to us to hurt
      any more of them. After we had fired, we gave them a cheer, as the seamen
      call it; that is to say, we hallooed, at them, by way of triumph, and so
      carried off their ambassador. How it fared with their general, we know
      nothing of that.
    
    
      This passage, when I related it to a friend of mine, after my return from
      those rambles, agreed so well with his relation of what happened to one Mr
      Knox, an English captain, who some time ago was decoyed on shore by these
      people, that it could not but be very much to my satisfaction to think
      what mischief we had all escaped; and I think it cannot but be very
      profitable to record the other story (which is but short) with my own, to
      show whoever reads this what it was I avoided, and prevent their falling
      into the like, if they have to do with the perfidious people of Ceylon.
      The relation is as follows:       
    
    
      The island of Ceylon being inhabited for the greatest part by barbarians,
      which will not allow any trade or commerce with any European nation, and
      inaccessible by any travellers, it will be convenient to relate the
      occasion how the author of this story happened to go into this island, and
      what opportunities he had of being fully acquainted with the people, their
      laws and customs, that so we may the better depend upon the account, and
      value it as it deserves, for the rarity as well as the truth of it; and
      both these the author gives us a brief relation of in this manner. His
      words are as follows:
    
    
      In the year 1657, the Anne frigate, of London, Captain Robert Knox,
      commander, on the 21st day of January, set sail out of the Downs, in the
      service of the honourable East India Company of England, bound for Fort St
      George, upon the coast of Coromandel, to trade for one year from port to
      port in India; which having performed, as he was lading his goods to
      return for England, being in the road of Masulipatam, on the 19th of
      November 1659, there happened such a mighty storm, that in it several
      ships were cast away, and he was forced to cut his mainmast by the board,
      which so disabled the ship, that he could not proceed in his voyage;
      whereupon Cottiar, in the island of Ceylon, being a very commodious bay,
      fit for her present distress, Thomas Chambers, Esq., since Sir Thomas
      Chambers, the agent at Fort St George, ordered that the ship should take
      in some cloth and India merchants belonging to Porto Novo, who might trade
      there while she lay to set her mast, and repair the other damages
      sustained by the storm. At her first coming thither, after the Indian
      merchants were set ashore, the captain and his men were very jealous of
      the people of that place, by reason the English never had any commerce or
      dealing with them; but after they had been there twenty days, going ashore
      and returning again at pleasure, without any molestation, they began to
      lay aside all suspicious thoughts of the people that dwelt thereabouts,
      who had kindly entertained them for their money.
    
    
      By this time the king of the country had notice of their arrival, and, not
      being acquainted with their intents, he sent down a dissauva, or general,
      with an army, to them, who immediately sent a messenger to the captain on
      board, to desire him to come ashore to him, pretending a letter from the
      king. The captain saluted the message with firing of guns, and ordered his
      son, Robert Knox, and Mr John Loveland, merchant of the ship, to go
      ashore, and wait on him. When they were come before him, he demanded who
      they were, and how long they should stay. They told him they were
      Englishmen, and not to stay above twenty or thirty days, and desired
      permission to trade in his Majesty's port. His answer was, that the king
      was glad to hear the English were come into his country, and had commanded
      him to assist them as they should desire, and had sent a letter to be
      delivered to none but the captain himself. They were then twelve miles
      from the seaside, and therefore replied, that the captain could not leave
      his ship to come so far; but if he pleased to go down to the seaside, the
      captain would wait on him to receive the letter; whereupon the dissauva
      desired them to stay that day, and on the morrow he would go with them;
      which, rather than displease him in so small a matter, they consented to.
      In the evening the dissauva sent a present to the captain of cattle and
      fruits,      c., which, being carried all night by the messengers, was
      delivered to him in the morning, who told him withal that his men were
      coming down with the dissauva, and desired his company on shore against
      his coming, having a letter from the king to deliver into his own hand.
      The captain, mistrusting nothing, came on shore with his boat, and,
      sitting under a tamarind tree, waited for the dissauva. In the meantime
      the native soldiers privately surrounded him and the seven men he had with
      him, and seizing them, carried them to meet the dissauva, bearing the
      captain on a hammock on their shoulders.
    
    
      The next day the long-boat's crew, not knowing what had happened, came on
      shore to cut down a tree to make cheeks for the mainmast, and were made
      prisoners after the same manner, though with more violence, because they
      were more rough with them, and made resistance; yet they were not brought
      to the captain and his company, but quartered in another house in the same
      town.
    
    
      The dissauva having thus gotten two boats and eighteen men, his next care
      was to gain the ship; and to that end, telling the captain that he and his
      men were only detained because the king intended to send letters and a
      present to the English nation by him, desired he would send some men on
      board his ship to order her to stay; and because the ship was in danger of
      being fired by the Dutch if she stayed long in the bay, to bring her up
      the river. The captain did not approve of the advice, but did not dare to
      own his dislike; so he sent his son with the order, but with a solemn
      conjuration to return again, which he accordingly did, bringing a letter
      from the company in the ship, that they would not obey the captain, nor
      any other, in this matter, but were resolved to stand on their own
      defence. This letter satisfied the dissauva, who thereupon gave the
      captain leave to write for what he would have brought from the ship,
      pretending that he had not the king's order to release them, though it
      would suddenly come.
    
    
      The captain seeing he was held in suspense, and the season of the year
      spending for the ship to proceed on her voyage to some place, sent order
      to Mr John Burford, the chief mate, to take charge of the ship, and set
      sail to Porto Novo, from whence they came, and there to follow the agent's
      order.
    
    
      And now began that long and sad captivity they all along feared. The ship
      being gone, the dissauva was called up to the king, and they were kept
      under guards a while, till a special order came from the king to part
      them, and put one in a town, for the conveniency of their maintenance,
      which the king ordered to be at the charge of the country. On September
      16, 1660, the captain and his son were placed in a town called Bonder
      Coswat, in the country of Hotcurly [? Hewarrisse Korle], distant from the
      city of Kandy northward thirty miles, and from the rest of the English a
      full day's journey. Here they had their provisions brought them twice a
      day, without money, as much as they could eat, and as good as the country
      yielded. The situation of the place was very pleasant and commodious; but
      that year that part of the land was very sickly by agues and fevers, of
      which many died. The captain and his son after some time were visited with
      the common distemper, and the captain, being also loaded with grief for
      his deplorable condition, languished more than three months, and then
      died, February 9, 1661.
    
    
      Robert Knox, his son, was now left desolate, sick, and in captivity,
      having none to comfort him but God, who is the Father of the fatherless,
      and hears the groans of such as are in captivity; being alone to enter
      upon a long scene of misery and calamity; oppressed with weakness of body
      and grief of soul for the loss of his father, and the remediless trouble
      that he was like to endure; and the first instance of it was in the burial
      of his father, for he sent his black boy to the people of the town, to
      desire their assistance, because they understood not their language; but
      they sent him only a rope, to drag him by the neck into the woods, and
      told him that they would offer him no other help, unless he would pay for
      it. This barbarous answer increased his trouble for his father's death,
      that now he was like to lie unburied, and be made a prey to the wild
      beasts in the woods; for the ground was very hard, and they had not tools
      to dig with, and so it was impossible for them to bury him; and having a
      small matter of money left him, viz., a pagoda and a gold ring, he hired a
      man, and so buried him in as decent a manner as their condition would
      permit.
    
    
      His dead father being thus removed out of his sight, but his ague
      continuing, he was reduced very low, partly by sorrow and partly by his
      disease. All the comfort he had was to go into the wood and fields with a
      book, either the "Practice of Piety" or Mr Rogers's "Seven Treatises,"
      which were the only two books he had, and meditate and read, and sometimes
      pray; in which his anguish made him often invert Elijah's petition,       that
      he might die, because his life was a burden to him. God, though He was
      pleased to prolong his life, yet He found a way to lighten his grief, by
      removing his ague, and granting him a desire which above all things was
      acceptable to him. He had read his two books over so often that he had
      both almost by heart; and though they were both pious and good writings,
      yet he longed for the truth from the original fountain, and thought it his
      greatest unhappiness that he had not a Bible, and did believe that he
      should never see one again; but, contrary to his expectation, God brought
      him one after this manner. As he was fishing one day with his black boy,
      to catch some fish to relieve his hunger, an old man passed by them, and
      asked his boy whether his master could read; and when the boy had answered
      yes, he told him that he had gotten a book from the Portuguese, when they
      left Colombo; and, if his master pleased, he would sell it him. The boy
      told his master, who bade him go and see what book it was. The boy having
      served the English some time, knew the book, and as soon as he got it into
      his hand, came running to him, calling out before he came to him, "It is
      the Bible!" The words startled him, and he flung down his angle to meet
      him, and, finding it was true, was mightily rejoiced to see it; but he was
      afraid he should not have enough to purchase it, though he was resolved to
      part with all the money he had, which was but one pagoda, to buy it; but
      his black boy persuading him to slight it, and leave it to him to buy it,
      he at length obtained it for a knit cap.
    
    
      This accident he could not but look upon as a great miracle, that God
      should bestow upon him such an extraordinary blessing, and bring him a
      Bible in his own native language, in such a remote part of the world,
      where His name was not known, and where it was never heard of that an
      Englishman had ever been before. The enjoyment of this mercy was a great
      comfort to him in captivity, and though he wanted no bodily convenience
      that the country did afford; for the king, immediately after his father's
      death, had sent an express order to the people of the towns, that they
      should be kind to him, and give him good victuals; and after he had been
      some time in the country, and understood the language, he got him good
      conveniences, as a house and gardens; and falling to husbandry, God so
      prospered him, that he had plenty, not only for himself, but to lend
      others; which being, according to the custom of the country, at 50 per
      cent. a year, much enriched him: he had also goats, which served him for
      mutton, and hogs and hens. Notwithstanding this, I say, for he lived as
      fine as any of their noblemen, he could not so far forget his native
      country as to be contented to dwell in a strange land, where there was to
      him a famine of God's word and sacraments, the want of which made all
      other things to be of little value to him; therefore, as he made it his
      daily and fervent prayer to God, in His good time, to restore him to both,
      so, at length, he, with one Stephen Rutland, who had lived with him two
      years before, resolved to make their escape, and, about the year 1673,
      meditated all secret ways to compass it. They had before taken up a way of
      peddling about the country, and buying tobacco, pepper, garlic, combs, and
      all sorts of iron ware, and carried them into those parts of the country
      where they wanted them; and now, to promote their design, as they went
      with their commodities from place to place, they discoursed with the
      country people (for they could now speak their language well) concerning
      the ways and inhabitants, where the isle was thinnest and fullest
      inhabited, where and how the watches lay from one country to another, and
      what commodities were proper for them to carry into all parts; pretending
      that they would furnish themselves with such wares as the respective
      places wanted. None doubted but what they did was upon the account of
      trade, because Mr Knox was so well seated, and could not be supposed to
      leave such an estate, by travelling northward, because that part of the
      land was least inhabited; and so, furnishing themselves with such wares as
      were vendible in those parts, they set forth, and steered their course
      towards the north part of the islands, knowing very little of the ways,
      which were generally intricate and perplexed, because they have no public
      roads, but a multitude of little paths from one town to another, and those
      often changing; and for white men to inquire about the ways was very
      dangerous, because the people would presently suspect their design.
    
    
      At this time they travelled from Conde Uda as far as the country of
      Nuwarakalawiya, which is the furthermost part of the king's dominions, and
      about three days' journey from their dwelling. They were very thankful to
      Providence that they had passed all difficulties so far, but yet they
      durst not go any farther, because they had no wares left to traffic with;
      and it being the first time they had been absent so long from home, they
      feared the townsmen would come after them to seek for them; and so they
      returned home, and went eight or ten times into those parts with their
      wares, till they became well acquainted both with the people and the
      paths.
    
    
      In these parts Mr Knox met his black boy, whom he had turned away divers
      years before. He had now got a wife and children, and was very poor; but
      being acquainted with these quarters, he not only took directions of him,
      but agreed with him, for a good reward, to conduct him and his companions
      to the Dutch. He gladly undertook it, and a time was appointed between
      them; but Mr Knox being disabled by a grievous pain, which seized him on
      his right side, and held him five days that he could not travel, this
      appointment proved in vain; for though he went as soon as he was well, his
      guide was gone into another country about his business, and they durst not
      at that time venture to run away without him.
    
    
      These attempts took up eight or nine years, various accidents hindering
      their designs, but most commonly the dry weather, because they feared in
      the woods they should be starved with thirst, all the country being in
      such a condition almost four or five years together for lack of rain.
    
    
      On September 22, 1679, they set forth again, furnished with knives and
      small axes for their defence, because they could carry them privately and
      send all sorts of wares to sell as formerly, and all necessary provisions,
      the moon being twenty-seven days old, that they might have light to run
      away by, to try what success God Almighty would now give them in seeking
      their liberty. Their first stage was to Anuradhapoora, in the way to which
      lay a wilderness, called Parraoth Mocolane, full of wild elephants,
      tigers, and bears; and because it is the utmost confines of the king's
      dominions, there is always a watch kept.
    
    
      In the middle of the way they heard that the governor's officers of these
      parts were out to gather up the king's revenues and duties, to send them
      up to the city; which put them into no small fear, lest, finding them,
      they should send them back again; whereupon they withdrew to the western
      parts of Ecpoulpot, and sat down to knitting till they heard the officers
      were gone. As soon as they were departed, they went onwards of their
      journey, having got a good parcel of cotton-yarn to knit caps with, and
      having kept their wares, as they pretended, to exchange for dried flesh,
      which was sold only in those lower parts. Their way lay necessarily
      through the governor's yard at Kalluvilla, who dwells there on purpose to
      examine all that go and come. This greatly distressed them, because he
      would easily suspect they were out of their bounds, being captives;
      however, they went resolutely to his house, and meeting him, presented him
      with a small parcel of tobacco and betel; and, showing him their wares,
      told him they came to get dried flesh to carry back with them. The
      governor did not suspect them, but told them he was sorry they came in so
      dry a time, when no deer were to be catched, but if some rain fell, he
      would soon supply them. This answer pleased them, and they seemed
      contented to stay; and accordingly, abiding with him two or three days,
      and no rain falling, they presented the governor with five or six charges
      of gunpowder, which is a rarity among them; and leaving a bundle at his
      house, they desired him to shoot them some deer, while they made a step to
      Anuradhapoora. Here also they were put in a great fright by the coming of
      certain soldiers from the king to the governor, to give him orders to set
      a secure guard at the watches, that no suspicious persons might pass,
      which, though it was only intended to prevent the flight of the relations
      of certain nobles whom the king had clapped up, yet they feared they might
      wonder to see white men here, and so send them back again; but God so
      ordered it that they were very kind to them and left them to their
      business, and so they got safe to Anuradhapoora. Their pretence was dried
      flesh, though they knew there was none to be had; but their real business
      was to search the way down to the Dutch, which they stayed three days to
      do; but finding that in the way to Jaffnapatam, which is one of the Dutch
      ports, there was a watch which could hardly be passed, and other
      inconveniences not surmountable, they resolved to go back, and take the
      river Malwatta Oya, which they had before judged would be a probable guide
      to lead them to the sea; and, that they might not be pursued, left
      Anuradhapoora just at night, when the people never travel for fear of wild
      beasts, on Sunday, October 12, being stored with all things needful for
      their journey, viz., ten days' provision, a basin to boil their provision
      in, two calabashes to fetch water in, and two great tallipat leaves for
      tents, with jaggery, sweetmeats, tobacco, betel, tinder-boxes, and a
      deerskin for shoes, to keep their feet from thorns, because to them they
      chiefly trusted. Being come to the river, they struck into the woods, and
      kept by the side of it; yet not going on the sand (lest their footsteps
      should be discerned), unless forced, and then going backwards.
    
    
      Being gotten a good way into the wood, it began to rain; wherefore they
      erected their tents, made a fire, and refreshed themselves against the
      rising of the moon, which was then eighteen days old; and having tied
      deerskins about their feet, and eased themselves of their wares, they
      proceeded on their journey. When they had travelled three or four hours
      with difficulty, because the moon gave but little light among the thick
      trees, they found an elephant in their way before them, and because they
      could not scare him away, they were forced to stay till morning; and so
      they kindled a fire, and took a pipe of tobacco. By the light they could
      not discern that ever anybody had been there, nothing being to be seen but
      woods; and so they were in great hopes that they were past all danger,
      being beyond all inhabitants; but they were mistaken, for the river
      winding northward, brought them into the midst of a parcel of towns,
      called Tissea Wava, where, being in danger of being seen, they were under
      a mighty terror; for had the people found them, they would have beat them,
      and sent them up to the king; and, to avoid it, they crept into a hollow
      tree, and sat there in mud and wet till it began to grow dark, and then
      betaking themselves to their legs, travelled till the darkness of night
      stopped them. They heard voices behind them, and feared it was somebody in
      pursuit of them; but at length, discerning it was only an hallooing to
      keep the wild beasts out of the corn, they pitched their tents by the
      river, and having boiled rice and roasted meat for their suppers, and
      satisfied their hunger, they committed themselves to God's keeping, and
      laid them down to sleep.
    
    
      The next morning, to prevent the worst, they got up early and hastened on
      their journey; and though they were now got out of all danger of the tame
      Chiangulays, they were in great danger of the wild ones, of whom those
      woods were full; and though they saw their tents, yet they were all gone,
      since the rains had fallen, from the river into the woods; and so God kept
      them from that danger, for, had they met the wild men, they had been shot.
    
    
      Thus they travelled from morning till night several days, through bushes
      and thorns, which made their arms and shoulders, which were naked, all of
      a gore blood. They often met with bears, hogs, deer, and wild buffaloes;
      but they all ran away as soon as they saw them. The river was exceedingly
      full of alligators; in the evening they used to pitch their tents, and
      make great fires both before and behind them, to affright the wild beasts;
      and though they heard the voices of all sorts, they saw none.
    
    
      On Thursday, at noon, they crossed the river Coronda [? Kannadera Oya],
      which parts the country of the Malabars from the king's, and on Friday,
      about nine or ten in the morning, came among the inhabitants, of whom they
      were as much afraid as of the Chiangulays before; for, though the
      Wanniounay, or prince of this people, payeth tribute to the Dutch out of
      fear, yet he is better affected to the King of Kandy, and, if he had took
      them, would have sent them up to their old master; but not knowing any way
      to escape, they kept on their journey by the river-side by day, because
      the woods were not to be travelled by night for thorns and wild beasts,
      who came down then to the river to drink. In all the Malabar country they
      met with only two Brahmins, who treated them very civilly; and for their
      money, one of them conducted them till they came into the territories of
      the Dutch, and out of all danger of the King of Kandy, which did not a
      little rejoice them; but yet they were in no small trouble how to find the
      way out of the woods, till a Malabar, for the lucre of a knife, conducted
      them to a Dutch town, where they found guides to conduct them from town to
      town, till they came to the fort called Aripo, where they arrived
      Saturday, October 18, 1679, and there thankfully adored God's wonderful
      providence, in thus completing their deliverance from a long captivity of
      nineteen years and six months.
    
    
      I come now back to my own history, which grows near a conclusion, as to
      the travels I took in this part of the world. We were now at sea, and we
      stood away to the north for a while, to try if we could get a market for
      our spice, for we were very rich in nutmegs, but we ill knew what to do
      with them; we durst not go upon the English coast, or, to speak more
      properly, among the English factories to trade; not that we were afraid to
      fight any two ships they had, and, besides that, we knew that, as they had
      no letters of marque, or of reprisals from the government, so it was none
      of their business to act offensively, no, not though we were pirates.
      Indeed, if we had made any attempt upon them, they might have justified
      themselves in joining together to resist, and assisting one another to
      defend themselves; but to go out of their business to attack a pirate ship
      of almost fifty guns, as we were, it was plain that it was none of their
      business, and consequently it was none of our concern, so we did not
      trouble ourselves about it; but, on the other hand, it was none of our
      business to be seen among them, and to have the news of us carried from
      one factory to another, so that whatever design we might be upon at
      another time, we should be sure to be prevented and discovered. Much less
      had we any occasion to be seen among any of the Dutch factories upon the
      coast of Malabar; for, being fully laden with the spices which we had, in
      the sense of their trade, plundered them of, it would have told them what
      we were, and all that we had been doing; and they would, no doubt, have
      concerned themselves all manner of ways to have fallen upon us.
    
    
      The only way we had for it was to stand away for Goa, and trade, if we
      could, for our spices, with the Portuguese factory there. Accordingly, we
      sailed almost thither, for we had made land two days before, and being in
      the latitude of Goa, were standing in fair for Margaon, on the head of
      Salsat, at the going up to Goa, when I called to the men at the helm to
      bring the ship to, and bid the pilot go away N.N.W., till we came out of
      sight of the shore, when William and I called a council, as we used to do
      upon emergencies, what course we should take to trade there and not be
      discovered; and we concluded at length that we would not go thither at
      all, but that William, with such trusty fellows only as could be depended
      upon, should go in the sloop to Surat, which was still farther northward,
      and trade there as merchants with such of the English factory as they
      could find to be for their turn.
    
    
      To carry this with the more caution, and so as not to be suspected, we
      agreed to take out all her guns, and put such men into her, and no other,
      as would promise us not to desire or offer to go on shore, or to enter
      into any talk or conversation with any that might come on board; and, to
      finish the disguise to our mind, William documented two of our men, one a
      surgeon, as he himself was, and the other, a ready-witted fellow, an old
      sailor, that had been a pilot upon the coast of New England, and was an
      excellent mimic; these two William dressed up like two Quakers, and made
      them talk like such. The old pilot he made go captain of the sloop, and
      the surgeon for doctor, as he was, and himself supercargo. In this figure,
      and the sloop all plain, no curled work upon her (indeed she had not much
      before), and no guns to be seen, away he went for Surat.
    
    
      I should, indeed, have observed, that we went, some days before we parted,
      to a small sandy island close under the shore, where there was a good cove
      of deep water, like a road, and out of sight of any of the factories,
      which are here very thick upon the coast. Here we shifted the loading of
      the sloop, and put into her such things only as we had a mind to dispose
      of there, which was indeed little but nutmegs and cloves, but chiefly the
      former; and from thence William and his two Quakers, with about eighteen
      men in the sloop, went away to Surat, and came to an anchor at a distance
      from the factory.
    
    
      William used such caution that he found means to go on shore himself, and
      the doctor, as he called him, in a boat which came on board them to sell
      fish, rowed with only Indians of the country, which boat he afterwards
      hired to carry him on board again. It was not long that they were on
      shore, but that they found means to get acquaintance with some Englishmen,
      who, though they lived there, and perhaps were the company's servants at
      first, yet appeared then to be traders for themselves, in whatever coast
      business especially came in their way; and the doctor was made the first
      to pick acquaintance; so he recommended his friend, the supercargo, till,
      by degrees, the merchants were as fond of the bargain as our men were of
      the merchants, only that the cargo was a little too much for them.
    
    
      However, this did not prove a difficulty long with them, for the next day
      they brought two more merchants, English also, into their bargain, and, as
      William could perceive by their discourse, they resolved, if they bought
      them, to carry them to the Gulf of Persia upon their own accounts. William
      took the hint, and, as he told me afterwards, concluded we might carry
      them there as well as they. But this was not William's present business;
      he had here no less than three-and-thirty ton of nuts and eighteen ton of
      cloves. There was a good quantity of mace among the nutmegs, but we did
      not stand to make much allowance. In short, they bargained, and the
      merchants, who would gladly have bought sloop and all, gave William
      directions, and two men for pilots, to go to a creek about six leagues
      from the factory, where they brought boats, and unloaded the whole cargo,
      and paid William very honestly for it; the whole parcel amounting, in
      money, to about thirty-five thousand pieces of eight, besides some goods
      of value, which William was content to take, and two large diamonds, worth
      about three hundred pounds sterling.
    
    
      When they paid the money, William invited them on board the sloop, where
      they came; and the merry old Quaker diverted them exceedingly with his
      talk, and "thee'd" them and "thou'd" them till he made them so drunk that
      they could not go on shore for that night.
    
    
      They would fain have known who our people were, and whence they came; but
      not a man in the sloop would answer them to any question they asked, but
      in such a manner as let them think themselves bantered and jested with.
      However, in discourse, William said they were able men for any cargo we
      could have brought them, and that they would have bought twice as much
      spice if we had had it. He ordered the merry captain to tell them that
      they had another sloop that lay at Margaon, and that had a great quantity
      of spice on board also; and that, if it was not sold when he went back
      (for that thither he was bound), he would bring her up.
    
    
      Their new chaps were so eager, that they would have bargained with the old
      captain beforehand. "Nay, friend," said he, "I will not trade with thee
      unsight and unseen; neither do I know whether the master of the sloop may
      not have sold his loading already to some merchants of Salsat; but if he
      has not when I come to him, I think to bring him up to thee."
    
    
      The doctor had his employment all this while, as well as William and the
      old captain, for he went on shore several times a day in the Indian boat,
      and brought fresh provisions for the sloop, which the men had need enough
      of. He brought, in particular, seventeen large casks of arrack, as big as
      butts, besides smaller quantities, a quantity of rice, and abundance of
      fruits, mangoes, pompions, and such things, with fowls and fish. He never
      came on board but he was deep laden; for, in short, he bought for the ship
      as well as for themselves; and, particularly, they half-loaded the ship
      with rice and arrack, with some hogs, and six or seven cows, alive; and
      thus, being well victualled, and having directions for coming again, they
      returned to us.
    
    
      William was always the lucky welcome messenger to us, but never more
      welcome to us than now; for where we had thrust in the ship, we could get
      nothing, except a few mangoes and roots, being not willing to make any
      steps into the country, or make ourselves known till we had news of our
      sloop; and indeed our men's patience was almost tired, for it was
      seventeen days that William spent upon this enterprise, and well bestowed
      too.
    
    
      When he came back we had another conference upon the subject of trade,
      namely, whether we should send the best of our spices, and other goods we
      had in the ship, to Surat, or whether we should go up to the Gulf of
      Persia ourselves, where it was probable we might sell them as well as the
      English merchants of Surat. William was for going ourselves, which, by the
      way, was from the good, frugal, merchant-like temper of the man, who was
      for the best of everything; but here I overruled William, which I very
      seldom took upon me to do; but I told him, that, considering our
      circumstances, it was much better for us to sell all our cargoes here,
      though we made but half-price of them, than to go with them to the Gulf of
      Persia, where we should run a greater risk, and where people would be much
      more curious and inquisitive into things than they were here, and where it
      would not be so easy to manage them, seeing they traded freely and openly
      there, not by stealth, as those men seemed to do; and, besides, if they
      suspected anything, it would be much more difficult for us to retreat,
      except by mere force, than here, where we were upon the high sea as it
      were, and could be gone whenever we pleased, without any disguise, or,
      indeed, without the least appearance of being pursued, none knowing where
      to look for us.
    
    
      My apprehensions prevailed with William, whether my reasons did or no, and
      he submitted; and we resolved to try another ship's loading to the same
      merchants. The main business was to consider how to get off that
      circumstance that had exposed them to the English merchants, namely that
      it was our other sloop; but this the old Quaker pilot undertook; for
      being, as I said, an excellent mimic himself, it was the easier for him to
      dress up the sloop in new clothes; and first, he put on all the carved
      work he had taken off before; her stern, which was painted of a dumb white
      or dun colour before, all flat, was now all lacquered and blue, and I know
      not how many gay figures in it; as to her quarter, the carpenters made her
      a neat little gallery on either side; she had twelve guns put into her,
      and some petereroes upon her gunnel, none of which were there before; and
      to finish her new habit or appearance, and make her change complete, he
      ordered her sails to be altered; and as she sailed before with a
      half-sprit, like a yacht, she sailed now with square-sail and mizzen-mast,
      like a ketch; so that, in a word, she was a perfect cheat, disguised in
      everything that a stranger could be supposed to take any notice of that
      had never had but one view, for they had been but once on board.
    
    
      In this mean figure the sloop returned; she had a new man put into her for
      captain, one we knew how to trust; and the old pilot appearing only as a
      passenger, the doctor and William acting as the supercargoes, by a formal
      procuration from one Captain Singleton, and all things ordered in form.
    
    
      We had a complete loading for the sloop; for, besides a very great
      quantity of nutmegs and cloves, mace, and some cinnamon, she had on board
      some goods which we took in as we lay about the Philippine Islands, while
      we waited as looking for purchase.
    
    
      William made no difficulty of selling this cargo also, and in about twenty
      days returned again, freighted with all necessary provisions for our
      voyage, and for a long time; and, as I say, we had a great deal of other
      goods: he brought us back about three-and-thirty thousand pieces of eight,
      and some diamonds, which, though William did not pretend to much skill in,
      yet he made shift to act so as not to be imposed upon, the merchants he
      had to deal with, too, being very fair men.
    
    
      They had no difficulty at all with these merchants, for the prospect they
      had of gain made them not at all inquisitive, nor did they make the least
      discovery of the sloop; and as to the selling them spices which were
      fetched so far from thence, it seems it was not so much a novelty there as
      we believed, for the Portuguese had frequently vessels which came from
      Macao in China, who brought spices, which they bought of the Chinese
      traders, who again frequently dealt among the Dutch Spice Islands, and
      received spices in exchange for such goods as they carried from China.
    
    
      This might be called, indeed, the only trading voyage we had made; and now
      we were really very rich, and it came now naturally before us to consider
      whither we should go next. Our proper delivery port, as we ought to have
      called it, was at Madagascar, in the Bay of Mangahelly; but William took
      me by myself into the cabin of the sloop one day, and told me he wanted to
      talk seriously with me a little; so we shut ourselves in, and William
      began with me.
    
    
      "Wilt thou give me leave," says William, "to talk plainly with thee upon
      thy present circumstances, and thy future prospect of living? and wilt
      thou promise, on thy word, to take nothing ill of me?"
    
    
      "With all my heart," said I. "William, I have always found your advice
      good, and your designs have not only been well laid, but your counsel has
      been very lucky to us; and, therefore, say what you will, I promise you I
      will not take it ill."
    
    
      "But that is not all my demand," says William; "if thou dost not like what
      I am going to propose to thee, thou shalt promise me not to make it public
      among the men."
    
    
      "I will not, William," says I, "upon my word;" and swore to him, too, very
      heartily.
    
    
      "Why, then," says William, "I have but one thing more to article with thee
      about, and that is, that thou wilt consent that if thou dost not approve
      of it for thyself, thou wilt yet consent that I shall put so much of it in
      practice as relates to myself and my new comrade doctor, so that it be
      nothing to thy detriment and loss."
    
    
      "In anything," says I, "William, but leaving me, I will; but I cannot part
      with you upon any terms whatever."
    
    
      "Well," says William, "I am not designing to part from thee, unless it is
      thy own doing. But assure me in all these points, and I will tell my mind
      freely."
    
    
      So I promised him everything he desired of me in the solemnest manner
      possible, and so seriously and frankly withal, that William made no
      scruple to open his mind to me.
    
    
      "Why, then, in the first place," says William, "shall I ask thee if thou
      dost not think thou and all thy men are rich enough, and have really
      gotten as much wealth together (by whatsoever way it has been gotten, that
      is not the question) as we all know what to do with?"
    
    
      "Why, truly, William," said I, "thou art pretty right; I think we have had
      pretty good luck."
    
    
      "Well, then," says William, "I would ask whether, if thou hast gotten
      enough, thou hast any thought of leaving off this trade; for most people
      leave off trading when they are satisfied of getting, and are rich enough;
      for nobody trades for the sake of trading; much less do men rob for the
      sake of thieving."
    
    
      "Well, William," says I, "now I perceive what it is thou art driving at. I
      warrant you," says I, "you begin to hanker after home."
    
    
      "Why, truly," says William, "thou hast said it, and so I hope thou dost
      too. It is natural for most men that are abroad to desire to come home
      again at last, especially when they are grown rich, and when they are (as
      thou ownest thyself to be) rich enough, and so rich as they know not what
      to do with more if they had it."
    
    
      "Well, William," said I, "but now you think you have laid your preliminary
      at first so home that I should have nothing to say; that is, that when I
      had got money enough, it would be natural to think of going home. But you
      have not explained what you mean by home, and there you and I shall
      differ. Why, man, I am at home; here is my habitation; I never had any
      other in my lifetime; I was a kind of charity school boy; so that I can
      have no desire of going anywhere for being rich or poor, for I have
      nowhere to go."
    
    
      "Why," says William, looking a little confused, "art not thou an
      Englishman?"
    
    
      "Yes," says I, "I think so: you see I speak English; but I came out of
      England a child, and never was in it but once since I was a man; and then
      I was cheated and imposed upon, and used so ill that I care not if I never
      see it more."
    
    
      "Why, hast thou no relations or friends there?" says he; "no acquaintance       none
      that thou hast any kindness or any remains of respect for?"
    
    
      "Not I, William," said I; "no more than I have in the court of the Geat
      Mogul."
    
    
      "Nor any kindness for the country where thou wast born?" says William.
    
    
      "Not I, any more than for the island of Madagascar, nor so much neither;
      for that has been a fortunate island to me more than once, as thou
      knowest, William," said I.
    
    
      William was quite stunned at my discourse, and held his peace; and I said
      to him, "Go on, William; what hast thou to say farther? for I hear you
      have some project in your head," says I; "come, let's have it out."
    
    
      "Nay," says William, "thou hast put me to silence, and all I had to say is
      overthrown; all my projects are come to nothing, and gone."
    
    
      "Well, but, William," said I, "let me hear what they were; for though it
      is so that what I have to aim at does not look your way, and though I have
      no relation, no friend, no acquaintance in England, yet I do not say I
      like this roving, cruising life so well as never to give it over. Let me
      hear if thou canst propose to me anything beyond it."
    
    
      "Certainly, friend," says William, very gravely, "there is something
      beyond it;" and lifting up his hands, he seemed very much affected, and I
      thought I saw tears stand in his eyes; but I, that was too hardened a
      wretch to be moved with these things, laughed at him. "What!" says I, "you
      mean death, I warrant you: don't you? That is beyond this trade. Why, when
      it comes, it comes; then we are all provided for."
    
    
      "Ay," says William, "that is true; but it would be better that some things
      were thought on before that came."
    
    
      "Thought on!" says I; "what signifies thinking of it? To think of death is
      to die, and to be always thinking of it is to be all one's life long
      a-dying. It is time enough to think of it when it comes."
    
    
      You will easily believe I was well qualified for a pirate that could talk
      thus. But let me leave it upon record, for the remark of other hardened
      rogues like myself,       my conscience gave me a pang that I never felt
      before when I said, "What signifies thinking of it?" and told me I should
      one day think of these words with a sad heart; but the time of my
      reflection was not yet come; so I went on.
    
    
      Says William very seriously, "I must tell thee, friend, I am sorry to hear
      thee talk so. They that never think of dying, often die without thinking
      of it."
    
    
      I carried on the jesting way a while farther, and said, "Prithee, do not
      talk of dying; how do we know we shall ever die?" and began to laugh.
    
    
      "I need not answer thee to that," says William; "it is not my place to
      reprove thee, who art commander over me here; but I would rather thou
      wouldst talk otherwise of death; it is a coarse thing."
    
    
      "Say anything to me, William," said I; "I will take it kindly." I began
      now to be very much moved at his discourse.
    
    
      Says William (tears running down his face), "It is because men live as if
      they were never to die, that so many die before they know how to live. But
      it was not death that I meant when I said that there was something to be
      thought of beyond this way of living."
    
    
      "Why, William," said I, "what was that?"
    
    
      "It was repentance," says he.
    
    
      "Why," says I, "did you ever know a pirate repent?"
    
    
      At this he startled a little, and returned, "At the gallows I have [known]
      one before, and I hope thou wilt be the second."
    
    
      He spoke this very affectionately, with an appearance of concern for me.
    
    
      "Well, William," says I, "I thank you; and I am not so senseless of these
      things, perhaps, as I make myself seem to be. But come, let me hear your
      proposal."
    
    
      "My proposal," says William, "is for thy good as well as my own. We may
      put an end to this kind of life, and repent; and I think the fairest
      occasion offers for both, at this very time, that ever did, or ever will,
      or, indeed, can happen again."
    
    
      "Look you, William," says I; "let me have your proposal for putting an end
      to our present way of living first, for that is the case before us, and
      you and I will talk of the other afterwards. I am not so insensible," said
      I, "as you may think me to be. But let us get out of this hellish
      condition we are in first."
    
    
      "Nay," says William, "thou art in the right there; we must never talk of
      repenting while we continue pirates."
    
    
      "Well," says I, "William, that's what I meant; for if we must not reform,
      as well as be sorry for what is done, I have no notion what repentance
      means; indeed, at best I know little of the matter; but the nature of the
      thing seems to tell me that the first step we have to take is to break off
      this wretched course; and I'll begin there with you, with all my heart."
    
    
      I could see by his countenance that William was thoroughly pleased with
      the offer; and if he had tears in-his eyes before, he had more now; but it
      was from quite a different passion; for he was so swallowed up with joy he
      could not speak.
    
    
      "Come, William," says I, "thou showest me plain enough thou hast an honest
      meaning; dost thou think it practicable for us to put an end to our
      unhappy way of living here, and get off?"
    
    
      "Yes," says he, "I think it very practicable for me; whether it is for
      thee or no, that will depend upon thyself."
    
    
      "Well," says I, "I give you my word, that as I have commanded you all
      along, from the time I first took you on board, so you shall command me
      from this hour, and everything you direct me I'll do."
    
    
      "Wilt thou leave it all to me? Dost thou say this freely?"
    
    
      "Yes, William," said I, "freely; and I'll perform it faithfully."
    
    
      "Why, then," says William, "my scheme is this: We are now at the mouth of
      the Gulf of Persia; we have sold so much of our cargo here at Surat, that
      we have money enough; send me away for Bassorah with the sloop, laden with
      the China goods we have on board, which will make another good cargo, and
      I'll warrant thee I'll find means, among the English and Dutch merchants
      there, to lodge a quantity of goods and money also as a merchant, so as we
      will be able to have recourse to it again upon any occasion, and when I
      come home we will contrive the rest; and, in the meantime, do you bring
      the ship's crew to take a resolution to go to Madagascar as soon as I
      return."
    
    
      I told him I thought he need not go so far as Bassorah, but might run into
      Gombroon, or to Ormuz, and pretend the same business.
    
    
      "No," says he, "I cannot act with the same freedom there, because the
      Company's factories are there, and I may be laid hold of there on pretence
      of interloping."
    
    
      "Well, but," said I, "you may go to Ormuz, then; for I am loth to part
      with you so long as to go to the bottom of the Persian Gulf." He returned,
      that I should leave it to him to do as he should see cause.
    
    
      We had taken a large sum of money at Surat, so that we had near a hundred
      thousand pounds in money at our command, but on board the great ship we
      had still a great deal more.
    
    
      I ordered him publicly to keep the money on board which he had, and to buy
      up with it a quantity of ammunition, if he could get it, and so to furnish
      us for new exploits; and, in the meantime, I resolved to get a quantity of
      gold and some jewels, which I had on board the great ship, and place them
      so that I might carry them off without notice as soon as he came back; and
      so, according to William's directions, I left him to go the voyage, and I
      went on board the great ship, in which we had indeed an immense treasure.
    
    
      We waited no less than two months for William's return, and indeed I began
      to be very uneasy about William, sometimes thinking he had abandoned me,
      and that he might have used the same artifice to have engaged the other
      men to comply with him, and so they were gone away together; and it was
      but three days before his return that I was just upon the point of
      resolving to go away to Madagascar, and give him over; but the old
      surgeon, who mimicked the Quaker and passed for the master of the sloop at
      Surat, persuaded me against that, for which good advice and apparent
      faithfulness in what he had been trusted with, I made him a party to my
      design, and he proved very honest.
    
    
      At length William came back, to our inexpressible joy, and brought a great
      many necessary things with him; as, particularly, he brought sixty barrels
      of powder, some iron shot, and about thirty ton of lead; also he brought a
      great deal of provisions; and, in a word, William gave me a public account
      of his voyage, in the hearing of whoever happened to be upon the
      quarter-deck, that no suspicions might be found about us.
    
    
      After all was done, William moved that he might go up again, and that I
      would go with him; named several things which we had on board that he
      could not sell there; and, particularly, told us he had been obliged to
      leave several things there, the caravans being not come in; and that he
      had engaged to come back again with goods.
    
    
      This was what I wanted. The men were eager for his going, and particularly
      because he told them they might load the sloop back with rice and
      provisions; but I seemed backward to going, when the old surgeon stood up
      and persuaded me to go, and with many arguments pressed me to it; as,
      particularly, if I did not go, there would be no order, and several of the
      men might drop away, and perhaps betray all the rest; and that they should
      not think it safe for the sloop to go again if I did not go; and to urge
      me to it, he offered himself to go with me.
    
    
      Upon these considerations I seemed to be over-persuaded to go, and all the
      company seemed to be better satisfied when I had consented; and,
      accordingly, we took all the powder, lead, and iron out of the sloop into
      the great ship, and all the other things that were for the ship's use, and
      put in some bales of spices and casks or frails of cloves, in all about
      seven ton, and some other goods, among the bales of which I had conveyed
      all my private treasure, which, I assure you, was of no small value, and
      away I went.
    
    
      At going off I called a council of all the officers in the ship to
      consider in what place they should wait for me, and how long, and we
      appointed the ship to stay eight-and-twenty days at a little island on the
      Arabian side of the Gulf, and that, if the sloop did not come in that
      time, they should sail to another island to the west of that place, and
      wait there fifteen days more, and that then, if the sloop did not come,
      they should conclude some accident must have happened, and the rendezvous
      should be at Madagascar.
    
    
      Being thus resolved, we left the ship, which both William and I, and the
      surgeon, never intended to see any more. We steered directly for the Gulf,
      and through to Bassorah, or Balsara. This city of Balsara lies at some
      distance from the place where our sloop lay, and the river not being very
      safe, and we but ill acquainted with it, having but an ordinary pilot, we
      went on shore at a village where some merchants live, and which is very
      populous, for the sake of small vessels riding there.
    
    
      Here we stayed and traded three or four days, landing all our bales and
      spices, and indeed the whole cargo that was of any considerable value,
      which we chose to do rather than go up immediately to Balsara till the
      project we had laid was put in execution.
    
    
      After we had bought several goods, and were preparing to buy several
      others, the boat being on shore with twelve men, myself, William, the
      surgeon, and one fourth man, whom we had singled out, we contrived to send
      a Turk just at the dusk of the evening with a letter to the boatswain, and
      giving the fellow a charge to run with all possible speed, we stood at a
      small distance to observe the event. The contents of the letter were thus
      written by the old doctor:       
    
    
      "BOATSWAIN THOMAS,       We are all betrayed. For God's sake make off with
      the boat, and get on board, or you are all lost. The captain, William the
      Quaker, and George the reformade are seized and carried away: I am escaped
      and hid, but cannot stir out; if I do I am a dead man. As soon as you are
      on board cut or slip, and make sail for your lives. Adieu.       R.S."
    
    
      We stood undiscovered, as above, it being the dusk of the evening, and saw
      the Turk deliver the letter, and in three minutes we saw all the men hurry
      into the boat and put off, and no sooner were they on board than they took
      the hint, as we supposed, for the next morning they were out of sight, and
      we never heard tale or tidings of them since.
    
    
      We were now in a good place, and in very good circumstances, for we passed
      for merchants of Persia.
    
    
      It is not material to record here what a mass of ill-gotten wealth we had
      got together: it will be more to the purpose to tell you that I began to
      be sensible of the crime of getting of it in such a manner as I had done;
      that I had very little satisfaction in the possession of it; and, as I
      told William, I had no expectation of keeping it, nor much desire; but, as
      I said to him one day walking out into the fields near the town of
      Bassorah, so I depended upon it that it would be the case, which you will
      hear presently.
    
    
      We were perfectly secured at Bassorah, by having frighted away the rogues,
      our comrades; and we had nothing to do but to consider how to convert our
      treasure into things proper to make us look like merchants, as we were now
      to be, and not like freebooters, as we really had been.
    
    
      We happened very opportunely here upon a Dutchman, who had travelled from
      Bengal to Agra, the capital city of the Great Mogul, and from thence was
      come to the coast of Malabar by land, and got shipping, somehow or other,
      up the Gulf; and we found his design was to go up the great river to
      Bagdad or Babylon, and so, by the caravan, to Aleppo and Scanderoon. As
      William spoke Dutch, and was of an agreeable, insinuating behaviour, he
      soon got acquainted with this Dutchman, and discovering our circumstances
      to one another, we found he had considerable effects with him; and that he
      had traded long in that country, and was making homeward to his own
      country; and that he had servants with him; one an Armenian, whom he had
      taught to speak Dutch, and who had something of his own, but had a mind to
      travel into Europe; and the other a Dutch sailor, whom he had picked up by
      his fancy, and reposed a great trust in him, and a very honest fellow he
      was.
    
    
      This Dutchman was very glad of an acquaintance, because he soon found that
      we directed our thoughts to Europe also; and as he found we were
      encumbered with goods only (for we let him know nothing of our money), he
      readily offered us his assistance to dispose of as many of them as the
      place we were in would put off, and his advice what to do with the rest.
    
    
      While this was doing, William and I consulted what to do with ourselves
      and what we had; and first, we resolved we would never talk seriously of
      our measures but in the open fields, where we were sure nobody could hear;
      so every evening, when the sun began to decline and the air to be moderate
      we walked out, sometimes this way, sometimes that, to consult of our
      affairs.
    
    
      I should have observed that we had new clothed ourselves here, after the
      Persian manner, with long vests of silk, a gown or robe of English crimson
      cloth, very fine and handsome, and had let our beards grow so after the
      Persian manner that we passed for Persian merchants, in view only, though,
      by the way, we could not understand or speak one word of the language of
      Persia, or indeed of any other but English and Dutch; and of the latter I
      understood very little.
    
    
      However, the Dutchman supplied all this for us; and as we had resolved to
      keep ourselves as retired as we could, though there were several English
      merchants upon the place, yet we never acquainted ourselves with one of
      them, or exchanged a word with them; by which means we prevented their
      inquiry of us now, or their giving any intelligence of us, if any news of
      our landing here should happen to come, which, it was easy for us to know,
      was possible enough, if any of our comrades fell into bad hands, or by
      many accidents which we could not foresee.
    
    
      It was during my being here, for here we stayed near two months, that I
      grew very thoughtful about my circumstances; not as to the danger, neither
      indeed were we in any, but were entirely concealed and unsuspected; but I
      really began to have other thoughts of myself, and of the world, than ever
      I had before.
    
    
      William had struck so deep into my unthinking temper with hinting to me
      that there was something beyond all this; that the present time was the
      time of enjoyment, but that the time of account approached; that the work
      that remained was gentler than the labour past, viz., repentance, and that
      it was high time to think of it;       I say these, and such thoughts as
      these, engrossed my hours, and, in a word, I grew very sad.
    
    
      As to the wealth I had, which was immensely great, it was all like dirt
      under my feet; I had no value for it, no peace in the possession of it, no
      great concern about me for the leaving of it.
    
    
      William had perceived my thoughts to be troubled and my mind heavy and
      oppressed for some time; and one evening, in one of our cool walks, I
      began with him about the leaving our effects. William was a wise and wary
      man, and indeed all the prudentials of my conduct had for a long time been
      owing to his advice, and so now all the methods for preserving our
      effects, and even ourselves, lay upon him; and he had been telling me of
      some of the measures he had been taking for our making homeward, and for
      the security of our wealth, when I took him very short. "Why, William,"
      says I, "dost thou think we shall ever be able to reach Europe with all
      this cargo that we have about us?"
    
    
      "Ay," says William, "without doubt, as well as other merchants with
      theirs, as long as it is not publicly known what quantity or of what value
      our cargo consists."
    
    
      "Why, William," says I, smiling, "do you think that if there is a God
      above, as you have so long been telling me there is, and that we must give
      an account to Him,       I say, do you think, if He be a righteous Judge,
      He will let us escape thus with the plunder, as we may call it, of so many
      innocent people, nay, I might say nations, and not call us to an account
      for it before we can get to Europe, where we pretend to enjoy it?"
    
    
      William appeared struck and surprised at the question, and made no answer
      for a great while; and I repeated the question, adding that it was not to
      be expected.
    
    
      After a little pause, says William, "Thou hast started a very weighty
      question, and I can make no positive answer to it; but I will state it
      thus: first, it is true that, if we consider the justice of God, we have
      no reason to expect any protection; but as the ordinary ways of Providence
      are out of the common road of human affairs, so we may hope for mercy
      still upon our repentance, and we know not how good He may be to us; so we
      are to act as if we rather depended upon the last, I mean the merciful
      part, than claimed the first, which must produce nothing but judgment and
      vengeance."
    
    
      "But hark ye, William," says I, "the nature of repentance, as you have
      hinted once to me, included reformation; and we can never reform; how,
      then, can we repent?"
    
    
      "Why can we never reform?" says William.
    
    
      "Because," said I, "we cannot restore what we have taken away by rapine
      and spoil."
    
    
      "It is true," says William, "we never can do that, for we can never come
      to the knowledge of the owners."
    
    
      "But what, then, must be done with our wealth," said I, "the effects of
      plunder and rapine? If we keep it, we continue to be robbers and thieves;
      and if we quit it we cannot do justice with it, for we cannot restore it
      to the right owners."
    
    
      "Nay," says William, "the answer to it is short. To quit what we have, and
      do it here, is to throw it away to those who have no claim to it, and to
      divest ourselves of it, but to do no right with it; whereas we ought to
      keep it carefully together, with a resolution to do what right with it we
      are able; and who knows what opportunity Providence may put into our hands
      to do justice, at least, to some of those we have injured? So we ought, at
      least, to leave it to Him and go on. As it is, without doubt our present
      business is to go to some place of safety, where we may wait His will."
    
    
      This resolution of William was very satisfying to me indeed, as, the truth
      is, all he said, and at all times, was solid and good; and had not William
      thus, as it were, quieted my mind, I think, verily, I was so alarmed at
      the just reason I had to expect vengeance from Heaven upon me for my
      ill-gotten wealth, that I should have run away from it as the devil's
      goods, that I had nothing to do with, that did not belong to me, and that
      I had no right to keep, and was in certain danger of being destroyed for.
    
    
      However, William settled my mind to more prudent steps than these, and I
      concluded that I ought, however, to proceed to a place of safety, and
      leave the event to God Almighty's mercy. But this I must leave upon
      record, that I had from this time no joy of the wealth I had got. I looked
      upon it all as stolen, and so indeed the greatest part of it was. I looked
      upon it as a hoard of other men's goods, which I had robbed the innocent
      owners of, and which I ought, in a word, to be hanged for here, and damned
      for hereafter. And now, indeed, I began sincerely to hate myself for a
      dog; a wretch that had been a thief and a murderer; a wretch that was in a
      condition which nobody was ever in; for I had robbed, and though I had the
      wealth by me, yet it was impossible I should ever make any restitution;
      and upon this account it ran in my head that I could never repent, for
      that repentance could not be sincere without restitution, and therefore
      must of necessity be damned. There was no room for me to escape. I went
      about with my heart full of these thoughts, little better than a
      distracted fellow; in short, running headlong into the dreadfullest
      despair, and premeditating nothing but how to rid myself out of the world;
      and, indeed, the devil, if such things are of the devil's immediate doing,
      followed his work very close with me, and nothing lay upon my mind for
      several days but to shoot myself into the head with my pistol.
    
    
      I was all this while in a vagrant life, among infidels, Turks, pagans, and
      such sort of people. I had no minister, no Christian to converse with but
      poor William. He was my ghostly father or confessor, and he was all the
      comfort I had. As for my knowledge of religion, you have heard my history.
      You may suppose I had not much; and as for the Word of God, I do not
      remember that I ever read a chapter in the Bible in my lifetime. I was
      little Bob at Bussleton, and went to school to learn my Testament.
    
    
      However, it pleased God to make William the Quaker everything to me. Upon
      this occasion, I took him out one evening, as usual, and hurried him away
      into the fields with me, in more haste than ordinary; and there, in short,
      I told him the perplexity of my mind, and under what terrible temptations
      of the devil I had been; that I must shoot myself, for I could not support
      the weight and terror that was upon me.
    
    
      "Shoot yourself!" says William; "why, what will that do for you?"
    
    
      "Why," says I, "it will put an end to a miserable life."
    
    
      "Well," says William, "are you satisfied the next will be better?"
    
    
      "No, no," says I; "much worse, to be sure."
    
    
      "Why, then," says he, "shooting yourself is the devil's motion, no doubt;
      for it is the devil of a reason, that, because thou art in an ill case,
      therefore thou must put thyself into a worse."
    
    
      This shocked my reason indeed. "Well, but," says I, "there is no bearing
      the miserable condition I am in."
    
    
      "Very well," says William; "but it seems there is some bearing a worse
      condition; and so you will shoot yourself, that you may be past remedy?"
    
    
      "I am past remedy already," says I.
    
    
      "How do you know that?" says he.
    
    
      "I am satisfied of it," said I.
    
    
      "Well," says he, "but you are not sure; so you will shoot yourself to make
      it certain; for though on this side death you cannot be sure you will be
      damned at all, yet the moment you step on the other side of time you are
      sure of it; for when it is done, it is not to be said then that you will
      be, but that you are damned."
    
    
      "Well, but," says William, as if he had been between jest and earnest,
      "pray, what didst thou dream of last night?"
    
    
      "Why," said I, "I had frightful dreams all night; and, particularly, I
      dreamed that the devil came for me, and asked me what my name was; and I
      told him. Then he asked me what trade I was. 'Trade?' says I; 'I am a
      thief, a rogue, by my calling: I am a pirate and a murderer, and ought to
      be hanged.' 'Ay, ay,' says the devil, 'so you do; and you are the man I
      looked for, and therefore come along with me.' At which I was most
      horribly frighted, and cried out so that it waked me; and I have been in
      horrible agony ever since."
    
    
      "Very well," says William; "come, give me the pistol thou talkedst of just
      now."
    
    
      "Why," says I, "what will you do with it?"
    
    
      "Do with it!" says William. "Why, thou needest not shoot thyself; I shall
      be obliged to do it for thee. Why, thou wilt destroy us all."
    
    
      "What do you mean, William?" said I.
    
    
      "Mean!" said he; "nay, what didst thou mean, to cry out aloud in thy
      sleep, 'I am a thief, a pirate, a murderer, and ought to be hanged'? Why,
      thou wilt ruin us all. 'Twas well the Dutchman did not understand English.
      In short, I must shoot thee, to save my own life. Come, come," says he,
      "give me thy pistol."
    
    
      I confess this terrified me again another way, and I began to be sensible
      that, if anybody had been near me to understand English, I had been
      undone. The thought of shooting myself forsook me from that time; and I
      turned to William, "You disorder me extremely, William," said I; "why, I
      am never safe, nor is it safe to keep me company. What shall I do? I shall
      betray you all."
    
    
      "Come, come, friend Bob," says he, "I'll put an end to it all, if you will
      take my advice."
    
    
      "How's that?" said I.
    
    
      "Why, only," says he, "that the next time thou talkest with the devil,
      thou wilt talk a little softlier, or we shall be all undone, and you too."
    
    
      This frighted me, I must confess, and allayed a great deal of the trouble
      of mind I was in. But William, after he had done jesting with me, entered
      upon a very long and serious discourse with me about the nature of my
      circumstances, and about repentance; that it ought to be attended, indeed,
      with a deep abhorrence of the crime that I had to charge myself with; but
      that to despair of God's mercy was no part of repentance, but putting
      myself into the condition of the devil; indeed, that I must apply myself
      with a sincere, humble confession of my crime, to ask pardon of God, whom
      I had offended, and cast myself upon His mercy, resolving to be willing to
      make restitution, if ever it should please God to put it in my power, even
      to the utmost of what I had in the world. And this, he told me, was the
      method which he had resolved upon himself; and in this, he told me, he had
      found comfort.
    
    
      I had a great deal of satisfaction in William's discourse, and it quieted
      me very much; but William was very anxious ever after about my talking in
      my sleep, and took care to lie with me always himself, and to keep me from
      lodging in any house where so much as a word of English was understood.
    
    
      However, there was not the like occasion afterward; for I was much more
      composed in my mind, and resolved for the future to live a quite different
      life from what I had done. As to the wealth I had, I looked upon it as
      nothing; I resolved to set it apart to any such opportunity of doing
      justice as God should put into my hand; and the miraculous opportunity I
      had afterwards of applying some parts of it to preserve a ruined family,
      whom I had plundered, may be worth reading, if I have room for it in this
      account.
    
    
      With these resolutions I began to be restored to some degree of quiet in
      my mind; and having, after almost three months' stay at Bassorah, disposed
      of some goods, but having a great quantity left, we hired boats according
      to the Dutchman's direction, and went up to Bagdad, or Babylon, on the
      river Tigris, or rather Euphrates. We had a very considerable cargo of
      goods with us, and therefore made a great figure there, and were received
      with respect. We had, in particular, two-and-forty bales of Indian stuffs
      of sundry sorts, silks, muslins, and fine chintz; we had fifteen bales of
      very fine China silks, and seventy packs or bales of spices, particularly
      cloves and nutmegs, with other goods. We were bid money here for our
      cloves, but the Dutchman advised us not to part with them, and told us we
      should get a better price at Aleppo, or in the Levant; so we prepared for
      the caravan.
    
    
      We concealed our having any gold or pearls as much as we could, and
      therefore sold three or four bales of China silks and Indian calicoes, to
      raise money to buy camels and to pay the customs which are taken at
      several places, and for our provisions over the deserts.
    
    
      I travelled this journey, careless to the last degree of my goods or
      wealth, believing that, as I came by it all by rapine and violence, God
      would direct that it should be taken from me again in the same manner;
      and, indeed, I think I might say I was very willing it should be so. But,
      as I had a merciful Protector above me, so I had a most faithful steward,
      counsellor, partner, or whatever I might call him, who was my guide, my
      pilot, my governor, my everything, and took care both of me and of all we
      had; and though he had never been in any of these parts of the world, yet
      he took the care of all upon him; and in about nine-and-fifty days we
      arrived from Bassorah, at the mouth of the river Tigris or Euphrates,
      through the desert, and through Aleppo to Alexandria, or, as we call it,
      Scanderoon, in the Levant.
    
    
      Here William and I, and the other two, our faithful comrades, debated what
      we should do; and here William and I resolved to separate from the other
      two, they resolving to go with the Dutchman into Holland, by the means of
      some Dutch ship which lay then in the road. William and I told them we
      resolved to go and settle in the Morea, which then belonged to the
      Venetians.
    
    
      It is true we acted wisely in it not to let them know whither we went,
      seeing we had resolved to separate; but we took our old doctor's
      directions how to write to him in Holland, and in England, that we might
      have intelligence from him on occasion, and promised to give him an
      account how to write to us, which we afterwards did, as may in time be
      made out.
    
    
      We stayed here some time after they were gone, till at length, not being
      thoroughly resolved whither to go till then, a Venetian ship touched at
      Cyprus, and put in at Scanderoon to look for freight home. We took the
      hint, and bargaining for our passage, and the freight of our goods, we
      embarked for Venice, where, in two-and-twenty days, we arrived safe, with
      all our treasure, and with such a cargo, take our goods and our money and
      our jewels together, as, I believed, was never brought into the city by
      two single men, since the state of Venice had a being.
    
    
      We kept ourselves here incognito for a great while, passing for two
      Armenian merchants still, as we had done before; and by this time we had
      gotten so much of the Persian and Armenian jargon, which they talked at
      Bassorah and Bagdad, and everywhere that we came in the country, as was
      sufficient to make us able to talk to one another, so as not to be
      understood by anybody, though sometimes hardly by ourselves.
    
    
      Here we converted all our effects into money, settled our abode as for a
      considerable time, and William and I, maintaining an inviolable friendship
      and fidelity to one another, lived like two brothers; we neither had or
      sought any separate interest; we conversed seriously and gravely, and upon
      the subject of our repentance continually; we never changed, that is to
      say, so as to leave off our Armenian garbs; and we were called, at Venice,
      the two Grecians.
    
    
      I had been two or three times going to give a detail of our wealth, but it
      will appear incredible, and we had the greatest difficulty in the world
      how to conceal it, being justly apprehensive lest we might be assassinated
      in that country for our treasure. At length William told me he began to
      think now that he must never see England any more, and that indeed he did
      not much concern himself about it; but seeing we had gained so great
      wealth, and he had some poor relations in England, if I was willing, he
      would write to know if they were living, and to know what condition they
      were in, and if he found such of them were alive as he had some thoughts
      about, he would, with my consent, send them something to better their
      condition.
    
    
      I consented most willingly; and accordingly William wrote to a sister and
      an uncle, and in about five weeks' time received an answer from them both,
      directed to himself, under cover of a hard Armenian name that he had given
      himself, viz., Signore Constantine Alexion of Ispahan, at Venice.
    
    
      It was a very moving letter he received from his sister, who, after the
      most passionate expressions of joy to hear he was alive, seeing she had
      long ago had an account that he was murdered by the pirates in the West
      Indies, entreats him to let her know what circumstances he was in; tells
      him she was not in any capacity to do anything considerable for him, but
      that he should be welcome to her with all her heart; that she was left a
      widow, with four children, but kept a little shop in the Minories, by
      which she made shift to maintain her family; and that she had sent him
      five pounds, lest he should want money, in a strange country, to bring him
      home.
    
    
      I could see the letter brought tears out of his eyes as he read it; and,
      indeed, when he showed it to me, and the little bill for five pounds, upon
      an English merchant in Venice, it brought tears out of my eyes too.
    
    
      After we had been both affected sufficiently with the tenderness and
      kindness of this letter, he turns to me; says he, "What shall I do for
      this poor woman?" I mused a while; at last says I, "I will tell you what
      you shall do for her. She has sent you five pounds, and she has four
      children, and herself, that is five; such a sum, from a poor woman in her
      circumstances, is as much as five thousand pounds is to us; you shall send
      her a bill of exchange for five thousand pounds English money, and bid her
      conceal her surprise at it till she hears from you again; but bid her
      leave off her shop, and go and take a house somewhere in the country, not
      far off from London, and stay there, in a moderate figure, till she hears
      from you again."
    
    
      "Now," says William, "I perceive by it that you have some thoughts of
      venturing into England."
    
    
      "Indeed, William," said I, "you mistake me; but it presently occurred to
      me that you should venture, for what have you done that you may not be
      seen there? Why should I desire to keep you from your relations, purely to
      keep me company?"
    
    
      William looked very affectionately upon me. "Nay," says he, "we have
      embarked together so long, and come together so far, I am resolved I will
      never part with thee as long as I live, go where thou wilt, or stay where
      thou wilt; and as for my sister," said William, "I cannot send her such a
      sum of money, for whose is all this money we have? It is most of it
      thine."
    
    
      "No, William," said I, "there is not a penny of it mine but what is yours
      too, and I won't have anything but an equal share with you, and therefore
      you shall send it to her; if not, I will send it."
    
    
      "Why," says William, "it will make the poor woman distracted; she will be
      so surprised she will go out of her wits."
    
    
      "Well," said I, "William, you may do it prudently; send her a bill backed
      of a hundred pounds, and bid her expect more in a post or two, and that
      you will send her enough to live on without keeping shop, and then send
      her more."
    
    
      Accordingly William sent her a very kind letter, with a bill upon a
      merchant in London for a hundred and sixty pounds, and bid her comfort
      herself with the hope that he should be able in a little time to send her
      more. About ten days after, he sent her another bill of five hundred and
      forty pounds; and a post or two after, another for three hundred pounds,
      making in all a thousand pounds; and told her he would send her sufficient
      to leave off her shop, and directed her to take a house as above.
    
    
      He waited then till he received an answer to all the three letters, with
      an account that she had received the money, and, which I did not expect,
      that she had not let any other acquaintance know that she had received a
      shilling from anybody, or so much as that he was alive, and would not till
      she had heard again.
    
    
      When he showed me this letter, "Well, William," said I, "this woman is fit
      to be trusted with life or anything; send her the rest of the five
      thousand pounds, and I'll venture to England with you, to this woman's
      house, whenever you will."
    
    
      In a word, we sent her five thousand pounds in good bills; and she
      received them very punctually, and in a little time sent her brother word
      that she had pretended to her uncle that she was sickly and could not
      carry on the trade any longer, and that she had taken a large house about
      four miles from London, under pretence of letting lodgings for her
      livelihood; and, in short, intimated as if she understood that he intended
      to come over to be incognito, assuring him he should be as retired
      as he pleased.
    
    
      This was opening the very door for us that we thought had been effectually
      shut for this life; and, in a word, we resolved to venture, but to keep
      ourselves entirely concealed, both as to name and every other
      circumstance; and accordingly William sent his sister word how kindly he
      took her prudent steps, and that she had guessed right that he desired to
      be retired, and that he obliged her not to increase her figure, but live
      private, till she might perhaps see him.
    
    
      He was going to send the letter away. "Come, William," said I, "you shan't
      send her an empty letter; tell her you have a friend coming with you that
      must be as retired as yourself, and I'll send her five thousand pounds
      more."
    
    
      So, in short, we made this poor woman's family rich; and yet, when it came
      to the point, my heart failed me, and I durst not venture; and for
      William, he would not stir without me; and so we stayed about two years
      after this, considering what we should do.
    
    
      You may think, perhaps, that I was very prodigal of my ill-gotten goods,
      thus to load a stranger with my bounty, and give a gift like a prince to
      one that had been able to merit nothing of me, or indeed know me; but my
      condition ought to be considered in this case; though I had money to
      profusion, yet I was perfectly destitute of a friend in the world, to have
      the least obligation or assistance from, or knew not either where to
      dispose or trust anything I had while I lived, or whom to give it to if I
      died.
    
    
      When I had reflected upon the manner of my getting of it, I was sometimes
      for giving it all to charitable uses, as a debt due to mankind, though I
      was no Roman Catholic, and not at all of the opinion that it would
      purchase me any repose to my soul; but I thought, as it was got by a
      general plunder, and which I could make no satisfaction for, it was due to
      the community, and I ought to distribute it for the general good. But
      still I was at a loss how, and where, and by whom to settle this charity,
      not daring to go home to my own country, lest some of my comrades,
      strolled home, should see and detect me, and for the very spoil of my
      money, or the purchase of his own pardon, betray and expose me to an
      untimely end.
    
    
      Being thus destitute, I say, of a friend, I pitched thus upon William's
      sister; the kind step of hers to her brother, whom she thought to be in
      distress, signifying a generous mind and a charitable disposition; and
      having resolved to make her the object of my first bounty, I did not doubt
      but I should purchase something of a refuge for myself, and a kind of a
      centre, to which I should tend in my future actions; for really a man that
      has a subsistence, and no residence, no place that has a magnetic
      influence upon his affections, is in one of the most odd, uneasy
      conditions in the world, nor is it in the power of all his money to make
      it up to him.
    
    
      It was, as I told you, two years and upwards that we remained at Venice
      and thereabout, in the greatest hesitation imaginable, irresolute and
      unfixed to the last degree. William's sister importuned us daily to come
      to England, and wondered we should not dare to trust her, whom we had to
      such a degree obliged to be faithful; and in a manner lamented her being
      suspected by us.
    
    
      At last I began to incline; and I said to William, "Come, brother
      William," said I (for ever since our discourse at Bassorah I called him
      brother), "if you will agree to two or three things with me, I'll go home
      to England with all my heart."
    
    
      Says William, "Let me know what they are."
    
    
      "Why, first," says I, "you shall not disclose yourself to any of your
      relations in England but your sister       no, not one; secondly, we will
      not shave off our mustachios or beards" (for we had all along worn our
      beards after the Grecian manner), "nor leave off our long vests, that we
      may pass for Grecians and foreigners; thirdly, that we shall never speak
      English in public before anybody, your sister excepted; fourthly, that we
      will always live together and pass for brothers."
    
    
      William said he would agree to them all with all his heart, but that the
      not speaking English would be the hardest, but he would do his best for
      that too; so, in a word, we agreed to go from Venice to Naples, where we
      converted a large sum of money into bales of silk, left a large sum in a
      merchant's hands at Venice, and another considerable sum at Naples, and
      took bills of exchange for a great deal too; and yet we came with such a
      cargo to London as few American merchants had done for some years, for we
      loaded in two ships seventy-three bales of thrown silk, besides thirteen
      bales of wrought silks, from the duchy of Milan, shipped at Genoa, with
      all which I arrived safely; and some time after I married my faithful
      protectress, William's sister, with whom I am much more happy than I
      deserve.
    
    
      And now, having so plainly told you that I am come to England, after I
      have so boldly owned what life I have led abroad, it is time to leave off,
      and say no more for the present, lest some should be willing to inquire
      too nicely after your old friend CAPTAIN BOB.
    
    
      [Transcriber's Note: The words "thae" (Scottish dialect for "those") and
      "Geat Mogul" ("Great" may be meant) do occur as such in the print copy.]

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
