INTRODUCTORY NOTE

The Maine Woods was the second volume collected
from his writings after Thoreau's death. Of the material
which composed it, the first two divisions were already
in print. "Ktaadn and the Maine Woods" was the title
of a paper printed in 1848 in The Union Magazine,
and "Chesuncook" was published in The Atlantic
Monthly in 1858. The book was edited by his friend
William Ellery Channing.

It was during his second summer at Walden that
Thoreau made his first visit to the Maine woods. It was
probably in response to a request from Horace Greeley
that he wrote out the narrative from his journal, for
Mr. Greeley had shown himself eager to help Thoreau
in putting his wares on the market. In a letter to Emerson,
January 12, 1848, Thoreau writes: "I read a part
of the story of my excursion to Ktaadn to quite a large
audience of men and boys, the other night, whom it
interested. It contains many facts and some poetry."
He offered the paper to Greeley at the end of March,
and on the 17th of April Greeley responded: "I inclose
you $25 for your article on Maine scenery, as promised.
I know it is worth more, though I have not yet found
time to read it; but I have tried once to sell it without
success. It is rather long for my columns, and too fine
for the million; but I consider it a cheap bargain, and
shall print it myself if I do not dispose of it to better
advantage. You will not, of course, consider yourself
x
under any sort of obligation to me, for my offer was in
the way of business, and I have got more than the worth
of my money." But this generous, high-minded friend
was thinking of Thoreau's business, not his own, for in
October of the same year he writes, "I break a silence
of some duration to inform you that I hope on Monday
to receive payment for your glorious account of 'Ktaadn
and the Maine Woods,' which I bought of you at a
Jew's bargain and sold to The Union Magazine. I am
to get $75 for it, and as I don't choose to exploiter you
at such a rate, I shall insist on inclosing you $25 more
in this letter, which will still leave me $25 to pay various
charges and labors I have incurred in selling your articles
and getting paid for them,&mdash;the latter by far the
most difficult portion of the business."

The third of Thoreau's excursions in the Maine woods
was made very largely for the purpose of studying Indian
life and character in the person of his guide. He
had all his life been interested in the Indians, and Mr.
Sanborn tells us&mdash;what is also evident from his journal&mdash;that
it was his purpose to expand his studies into a
separate work on the subject, for which he had collected
a considerable amount of material from books
as well as from his own observations. After his return
from the Allegash and East Branch he wrote as follows
to Mr. Blake under date of August 18, 1857: "I
have now returned, and think I have had a quite profitable
journey, chiefly from associating with an intelligent
Indian.... Having returned, I flatter myself that the
world appears in some respects a little larger, and not
as usual smaller and shallower for having extended my
xi
range. I have made a short excursion into the new
world which the Indian dwells in, or is. He begins
where we leave off. It is worth the while to detect new
faculties in man, he is so much the more divine; and
anything that fairly excites our admiration expands us.
The Indian who can find his way so wonderfully in the
woods possesses so much intelligence which the white
man does not, and it increases my own capacity as
well as faith to observe it. I rejoice to find that intelligence
flows in other channels than I knew. It redeems
for me portions of what seemed brutish before. It is a
great satisfaction to find that your oldest convictions
are permanent. With regard to essentials I have never
had occasion to change my mind. The aspect of the
world varies from year to year as the landscape is differently
clothed, but I find that the truth is still true, and
I never regret any emphasis which it may have inspired.
Ktaadn is there still, but much more surely my old
conviction is there, resting with more than mountain
breadth and weight on the world, the source still of fertilizing
streams, and affording glorious views from its
summit if I can get up to it again."



THE MAINE WOODS



KTAADN

On the 31st of August, 1846, I left Concord in Massachusetts
for Bangor and the backwoods of Maine, by
way of the railroad and steamboat, intending to accompany
a relative of mine, engaged in the lumber trade
in Bangor, as far as a dam on the West Branch of the
Penobscot, in which property he was interested. From
this place, which is about one hundred miles by the river
above Bangor, thirty miles from the Houlton military
road, and five miles beyond the last log hut, I proposed
to make excursions to Mount Ktaadn, the second highest
mountain in New England, about thirty miles distant,
and to some of the lakes of the Penobscot, either alone
or with such company as I might pick up there. It is
unusual to find a camp so far in the woods at that season,
when lumbering operations have ceased, and I was glad
to avail myself of the circumstance of a gang of men being
employed there at that time in repairing the injuries
caused by the great freshet in the spring. The mountain
may be approached more easily and directly on horseback
and on foot from the northeast side, by the Aroostook
road, and the Wassataquoik River; but in that
case you see much less of the wilderness, none of the
glorious river and lake scenery, and have no experience
of the batteau and the boatman's life. I was fortunate
also in the season of the year, for in the summer
myriads of black flies, mosquitoes, and midges, or, as
the Indians call them, "no-see-ems," make traveling in
4
the woods almost impossible; but now their reign was
nearly over.

Ktaadn, whose name is an Indian word signifying
highest land, was first ascended by white men in 1804.
It was visited by Professor J. W. Bailey of West Point
in 1836; by Dr. Charles T. Jackson, the State Geologist,
in 1837; and by two young men from Boston in
1845. All these have given accounts of their expeditions.
Since I was there, two or three other parties have made
the excursion, and told their stories. Besides these, very
few, even among backwoodsmen and hunters, have ever
climbed it, and it will be a long time before the tide of
fashionable travel sets that way. The mountainous region
of the State of Maine stretches from near the White
Mountains, northeasterly one hundred and sixty miles,
to the head of the Aroostook River, and is about sixty
miles wide. The wild or unsettled portion is far more
extensive. So that some hours only of travel in this direction
will carry the curious to the verge of a primitive
forest, more interesting, perhaps, on all accounts, than
they would reach by going a thousand miles westward.

The next forenoon, Tuesday, September 1, I started
with my companion in a buggy from Bangor for "up
river," expecting to be overtaken the next day night at
Mattawamkeag Point, some sixty miles off, by two more
Bangoreans, who had decided to join us in a trip to the
mountain. We had each a knapsack or bag filled with
such clothing and articles as were indispensable, and
my companion carried his gun.

Within a dozen miles of Bangor we passed through
the villages of Stillwater and Oldtown, built at the falls
5
of the Penobscot, which furnish the principal power by
which the Maine woods are converted into lumber.
The mills are built directly over and across the river.
Here is a close jam, a hard rub, at all seasons; and then
the once green tree, long since white, I need not say as
the driven snow, but as a driven log, becomes lumber
merely. Here your inch, your two and your three inch
stuff begin to be, and Mr. Sawyer marks off those spaces
which decide the destiny of so many prostrate forests.
Through this steel riddle, more or less coarse, is the arrowy
Maine forest, from Ktaadn and Chesuncook, and
the head-waters of the St. John, relentlessly sifted, till
it comes out boards, clapboards, laths, and shingles such
as the wind can take, still, perchance, to be slit and slit
again, till men get a size that will suit. Think how stood
the white pine tree on the shore of Chesuncook, its
branches soughing with the four winds, and every individual
needle trembling in the sunlight,&mdash;think how
it stands with it now,&mdash;sold, perchance, to the New
England Friction-Match Company! There were in
1837, as I read, two hundred and fifty sawmills on the
Penobscot and its tributaries above Bangor, the greater
part of them in this immediate neighborhood, and they
sawed two hundred millions of feet of boards annually.
To this is to be added the lumber of the Kennebec, Androscoggin,
Saco, Passamaquoddy, and other streams.
No wonder that we hear so often of vessels which are
becalmed off our coast being surrounded a week at a
time by floating lumber from the Maine woods. The
mission of men there seems to be, like so many busy
demons, to drive the forest all out of the country, from
6
every solitary beaver swamp and mountain-side, as soon
as possible.

At Oldtown, we walked into a batteau-manufactory.
The making of batteaux is quite a business here for the
supply of the Penobscot River. We examined some on
the stocks. They are light and shapely vessels, calculated
for rapid and rocky streams, and to be carried over long
portages on men's shoulders, from twenty to thirty feet
long, and only four or four and a half wide, sharp at
both ends like a canoe, though broadest forward on the
bottom, and reaching seven or eight feet over the water,
in order that they may slip over rocks as gently as possible.
They are made very slight, only two boards to a
side, commonly secured to a few light maple or other
hard-wood knees, but inward are of the clearest and
widest white pine stuff, of which there is a great waste
on account of their form, for the bottom is left perfectly
flat, not only from side to side, but from end to end.
Sometimes they become "hogging" even, after long
use, and the boatmen then turn them over and straighten
them by a weight at each end. They told us that one
wore out in two years, or often in a single trip, on the
rocks, and sold for from fourteen to sixteen dollars.
There was something refreshing and wildly musical to
my ears in the very name of the white man's canoe, reminding
me of Charlevoix and Canadian Voyageurs.
The batteau is a sort of mongrel between the canoe and
the boat, a fur-trader's boat.

The ferry here took us past the Indian island. As we
left the shore, I observed a short, shabby, washerwoman-looking
Indian,&mdash;they commonly have the woebegone
7
look of the girl that cried for spilt milk,&mdash;just from
"up river," land on the Oldtown side near a grocery,
and, drawing up his canoe, take out a bundle of skins
in one hand, and an empty keg or half-barrel in the other,
and scramble up the bank with them. This picture will
do to put before the Indian's history, that is, the history
of his extinction. In 1837 there were three hundred and
sixty-two souls left of this tribe. The island seemed deserted
to-day, yet I observed some new houses among
the weather-stained ones, as if the tribe had still a design
upon life; but generally they have a very shabby, forlorn,
and cheerless look, being all back side and woodshed,
not homesteads, even Indian homesteads, but instead
of home or abroad-steads, for their life is domi aut
militiæ, at home or at war, or now rather venatus, that
is, a hunting, and most of the latter. The church is the
only trim-looking building, but that is not Abenaki,
that was Rome's doings. Good Canadian it may be,
but it is poor Indian. These were once a powerful tribe.
Politics are all the rage with them now. I even thought
that a row of wigwams, with a dance of powwows, and
a prisoner tortured at the stake, would be more respectable
than this.

We landed in Milford, and rode along on the east side
of the Penobscot, having a more or less constant view of
the river, and the Indian islands in it, for they retain all
the islands as far up as Nicketow, at the mouth of the
East Branch. They are generally well-timbered, and
are said to be better soil than the neighboring shores.
The river seemed shallow and rocky, and interrupted by
rapids, rippling and gleaming in the sun. We paused a
8
moment to see a fish hawk dive for a fish down straight
as an arrow, from a great height, but he missed his prey
this time. It was the Houlton road on which we were
now traveling, over which some troops were marched
once towards Mars' Hill, though not to Mars' field, as
it proved. It is the main, almost the only, road in these
parts, as straight and well made, and kept in as good
repair as almost any you will find anywhere. Everywhere
we saw signs of the great freshet,&mdash;this house
standing awry, and that where it was not founded, but
where it was found, at any rate, the next day; and that
other with a waterlogged look, as if it were still airing
and drying its basement, and logs with everybody's
marks upon them, and sometimes the marks of their
having served as bridges, strewn along the road. We
crossed the Sunkhaze, a summery Indian name, the
Olemmon, Passadumkeag, and other streams, which
make a greater show on the map than they now did on
the road. At Passadumkeag we found anything but
what the name implies,&mdash;earnest politicians, to wit,&mdash;white
ones, I mean,&mdash;on the alert to know how the election
was likely to go; men who talked rapidly, with subdued
voice, and a sort of factitious earnestness you could
not help believing, hardly waiting for an introduction,
one on each side of your buggy, endeavoring to say much
in little, for they see you hold the whip impatiently, but
always saying little in much. Caucuses they have had,
it seems, and caucuses they are to have again,&mdash;victory
and defeat. Somebody may be elected, somebody
may not. One man, a total stranger, who stood by our
carriage in the dusk, actually frightened the horse with
9
his asseverations, growing more solemnly positive as
there was less in him to be positive about. So Passadumkeag
did not look on the map. At sundown, leaving
the river road awhile for shortness, we went by way of
Enfield, where we stopped for the night. This, like most
of the localities bearing names on this road, was a place
to name which, in the midst of the unnamed and unincorporated
wilderness, was to make a distinction without
a difference, it seemed to me. Here, however, I noticed
quite an orchard of healthy and well-grown apple
trees, in a bearing state, it being the oldest settler's house
in this region, but all natural fruit and comparatively
worthless for want of a grafter. And so it is generally,
lower down the river. It would be a good speculation,
as well as a favor conferred on the settlers, for a Massachusetts
boy to go down there with a trunk full of choice
scions, and his grafting apparatus, in the spring.

The next morning we drove along through a high and
hilly country, in view of Cold-Stream Pond, a beautiful
lake four or five miles long, and came into the Houlton
road again, here called the military road, at Lincoln,
forty-five miles from Bangor, where there is quite a village
for this country,&mdash;the principal one above Oldtown.
Learning that there were several wigwams here,
on one of the Indian islands, we left our horse and wagon
and walked through the forest half a mile to the river,
to procure a guide to the mountain. It was not till after
considerable search that we discovered their habitations,&mdash;small
huts, in a retired place, where the scenery
was unusually soft and beautiful, and the shore skirted
with pleasant meadows and graceful elms. We paddled
10
ourselves across to the island side in a canoe, which we
found on the shore. Near where we landed sat an Indian
girl, ten or twelve years old, on a rock in the water, in
the sun, washing, and humming or moaning a song
meanwhile. It was an aboriginal strain. A salmon-spear,
made wholly of wood, lay on the shore, such as they
might have used before white men came. It had an
elastic piece of wood fastened to one side of its point,
which slipped over and closed upon the fish, somewhat
like the contrivance for holding a bucket at the end of a
well-pole. As we walked up to the nearest house, we were
met by a sally of a dozen wolfish-looking dogs, which
may have been lineal descendants from the ancient Indian
dogs, which the first voyageurs describe as "their
wolves." I suppose they were. The occupant soon appeared,
with a long pole in his hand, with which he beat
off the dogs, while he parleyed with us,&mdash;a stalwart,
but dull and greasy-looking fellow, who told us, in his
sluggish way, in answer to our questions, as if it were
the first serious business he had to do that day, that there
were Indians going "up river"&mdash;he and one other&mdash;to-day,
before noon. And who was the other? Louis Neptune,
who lives in the next house. Well, let us go over
and see Louis together. The same doggish reception,
and Louis Neptune makes his appearance,&mdash;a small,
wiry man, with puckered and wrinkled face, yet he
seemed the chief man of the two; the same, as I remembered,
who had accompanied Jackson to the mountain
in '37. The same questions were put to Louis, and the
same information obtained, while the other Indian stood
by. It appeared that they were going to start by noon,
11
with two canoes, to go up to Chesuncook to hunt moose,&mdash;to
be gone a month. "Well, Louis, suppose you get
to the Point (to the Five Islands, just below Mattawamkeag)
to camp, we walk on up the West Branch tomorrow,&mdash;four
of us,&mdash;and wait for you at the dam,
or this side. You overtake us to-morrow or next day,
and take us into your canoes. We stop for you, you stop
for us. We pay you for your trouble." "Ye'," replied
Louis, "may be you carry some provision for all,&mdash;some
pork,&mdash;some bread,&mdash;and so pay." He said,
"Me sure get some moose;" and when I asked if he
thought Pomola would let us go up, he answered that
we must plant one bottle of rum on the top; he had
planted good many; and when he looked again, the
rum was all gone. He had been up two or three times;
he had planted letter,&mdash;English, German, French,
etc. These men were slightly clad in shirt and pantaloons,
like laborers with us in warm weather. They did
not invite us into their houses, but met us outside. So
we left the Indians, thinking ourselves lucky to have
secured such guides and companions.

There were very few houses along the road, yet they
did not altogether fail, as if the law by which men are
dispersed over the globe were a very stringent one, and
not to be resisted with impunity or for slight reasons.
There were even the germs of one or two villages just
beginning to expand. The beauty of the road itself was
remarkable. The various evergreens, many of which are
rare with us,&mdash;delicate and beautiful specimens of the
larch, arbor-vitæ, ball-spruce, and fir-balsam, from a
few inches to many feet in height,&mdash;lined its sides, in
12
some places like a long front yard, springing up from
the smooth grass-plots which uninterruptedly border it,
and are made fertile by its wash; while it was but a step
on either hand to the grim, untrodden wilderness, whose
tangled labyrinth of living, fallen, and decaying trees
only the deer and moose, the bear and wolf can easily
penetrate. More perfect specimens than any front-yard
plot can show grew there to grace the passage of the
Houlton teams.

About noon we reached the Mattawamkeag, fifty-six
miles from Bangor by the way we had come, and put up
at a frequented house still on the Houlton road, where
the Houlton stage stops. Here was a substantial covered
bridge over the Mattawamkeag, built, I think they
said, some seventeen years before. We had dinner,&mdash;where,
by the way, and even at breakfast, as well as
supper, at the public-houses on this road, the front rank
is composed of various kinds of "sweet cakes," in a continuous
line from one end of the table to the other. I
think I may safely say that there was a row of ten or a
dozen plates of this kind set before us two here. To
account for which, they say that, when the lumberers
come out of the woods, they have a craving for cakes
and pies, and such sweet things, which there are almost
unknown, and this is the supply to satisfy that demand.
The supply is always equal to the demand, and these
hungry men think a good deal of getting their money's
worth. No doubt the balance of victuals is restored by
the time they reach Bangor,&mdash;Mattawamkeag takes
off the raw edge. Well, over this front rank, I say, you,
coming from the "sweet cake" side, with a cheap philosophic
13
indifference though it may be, have to assault
what there is behind, which I do not by any means
mean to insinuate is insufficient in quantity or quality
to supply that other demand, of men, not from the woods
but from the towns, for venison and strong country fare.
After dinner we strolled down to the "Point," formed by
the junction of the two rivers, which is said to be the
scene of an ancient battle between the Eastern Indians
and the Mohawks, and searched there carefully for
relics, though the men at the bar-room had never heard
of such things; but we found only some flakes of arrowhead
stone, some points of arrowheads, one small leaden
bullet, and some colored beads, the last to be referred,
perhaps, to early fur-trader days. The Mattawamkeag,
though wide, was a mere river's bed, full of rocks and
shallows at this time, so that you could cross it almost
dry-shod in boots; and I could hardly believe my companion,
when he told me that he had been fifty or sixty
miles up it in a batteau, through distant and still uncut
forests. A batteau could hardly find a harbor now at its
mouth. Deer and caribou, or reindeer, are taken here
in the winter, in sight of the house.

Before our companions arrived, we rode on up the
Houlton road seven miles to Molunkus, where the Aroostook
road comes into it, and where there is a spacious
public house in the woods, called the "Molunkus
House," kept by one Libbey, which looked as if it had
its hall for dancing and for military drills. There was
no other evidence of man but this huge shingle palace
in this part of the world; but sometimes even this is
filled with travelers. I looked off the piazza round the
14
corner of the house up the Aroostook road, on which
there was no clearing in sight. There was a man just
adventuring upon it this evening in a rude, original,
what you may call Aroostook wagon,&mdash;a mere seat,
with a wagon swung under it, a few bags on it, and a
dog asleep to watch them. He offered to carry a message
for us to anybody in that country, cheerfully. I
suspect that, if you should go to the end of the world,
you would find somebody there going farther, as if just
starting for home at sundown, and having a last word
before he drove off. Here, too, was a small trader,
whom I did not see at first, who kept a store,&mdash;but no
great store, certainly,&mdash;in a small box over the way,
behind the Molunkus sign-post. It looked like the balance-box
of a patent hay-scales. As for his house, we
could only conjecture where that was; he may have
been a boarder in the Molunkus House. I saw him
standing in his shop door,&mdash;his shop was so small, that,
if a traveler should make demonstrations of entering in,
he would have to go out by the back way, and confer
with his customer through a window, about his goods
in the cellar, or, more probably, bespoken, and yet on
the way. I should have gone in, for I felt a real impulse
to trade, if I had not stopped to consider what would
become of him. The day before, we had walked into
a shop, over against an inn where we stopped, the puny
beginning of trade, which would grow at last into a firm
copartnership in the future town or city,&mdash;indeed, it
was already "Somebody &amp; Co.," I forget who. The
woman came forward from the penetralia of the attached
house, for "Somebody &amp; Co." was in the burning,
15
and she sold us percussion-caps, canalés and smooth,
and knew their prices and qualities, and which the hunters
preferred. Here was a little of everything in a small
compass to satisfy the wants and the ambition of the
woods,&mdash;a stock selected with what pains and care,
and brought home in the wagon-box, or a corner of the
Houlton team; but there seemed to me, as usual, a preponderance
of children's toys,&mdash;dogs to bark, and cats
to mew, and trumpets to blow, where natives there hardly
are yet. As if a child born into the Maine woods, among
the pine cones and cedar berries, could not do without
such a sugar-man or skipping-jack as the young Rothschild
has.

I think that there was not more than one house on the
road to Molunkus, or for seven miles. At that place we
got over the fence into a new field, planted with potatoes,
where the logs were still burning between the hills; and,
pulling up the vines, found good-sized potatoes, nearly
ripe, growing like weeds, and turnips mixed with them.
The mode of clearing and planting is to fell the trees,
and burn once what will burn, then cut them up into
suitable lengths, roll into heaps, and burn again; then,
with a hoe, plant potatoes where you can come at the
ground between the stumps and charred logs; for a first
crop the ashes sufficing for manure, and no hoeing
being necessary the first year. In the fall, cut, roll, and
burn again, and so on, till the land is cleared; and soon
it is ready for grain, and to be laid down. Let those talk
of poverty and hard times who will in the towns and
cities; cannot the emigrant who can pay his fare to
New York or Boston pay five dollars more to get here,&mdash;I
16
paid three, all told, for my passage from Boston to
Bangor, two hundred and fifty miles,&mdash;and be as rich
as he pleases, where land virtually costs nothing, and
houses only the labor of building, and he may begin life
as Adam did? If he will still remember the distinction
of poor and rich, let him bespeak him a narrower house
forthwith.

When we returned to the Mattawamkeag, the Houlton
stage had already put up there; and a Province
man was betraying his greenness to the Yankees by his
questions. Why Province money won't pass here at par,
when States' money is good at Fredericton,&mdash;though
this, perhaps, was sensible enough. From what I saw
then, it appears that the Province man was now the only
real Jonathan, or raw country bumpkin, left so far behind
by his enterprising neighbors that he didn't know
enough to put a question to them. No people can long
continue provincial in character who have the propensity
for politics and whittling, and rapid traveling, which
the Yankees have, and who are leaving the mother country
behind in the variety of their notions and inventions.
The possession and exercise of practical talent merely
are a sure and rapid means of intellectual culture and
independence.

The last edition of Greenleaf's Map of Maine hung
on the wall here, and, as we had no pocket-map, we resolved
to trace a map of the lake country. So, dipping
a wad of tow into the lamp, we oiled a sheet of paper on
the oiled table-cloth, and, in good faith, traced what we
afterwards ascertained to be a labyrinth of errors, carefully
following the outlines of the imaginary lakes which
17
the map contains. The Map of the Public Lands of
Maine and Massachusetts is the only one I have seen
that at all deserves the name. It was while we were
engaged in this operation that our companions arrived.
They had seen the Indians' fire on the Five Islands,
and so we concluded that all was right.

Early the next morning we had mounted our packs,
and prepared for a tramp up the West Branch, my companion
having turned his horse out to pasture for a week
or ten days, thinking that a bite of fresh grass and a
taste of running water would do him as much good as
backwoods fare and new country influences his master.
Leaping over a fence, we began to follow an obscure
trail up the northern bank of the Penobscot. There was
now no road further, the river being the only highway,
and but half a dozen log huts, confined to its banks, to
be met with for thirty miles. On either hand, and beyond,
was a wholly uninhabited wilderness, stretching
to Canada. Neither horse nor cow, nor vehicle of any
kind, had ever passed over this ground; the cattle, and
the few bulky articles which the loggers use, being got
up in the winter on the ice, and down again before it
breaks up. The evergreen woods had a decidedly sweet
and bracing fragrance; the air was a sort of diet-drink,
and we walked on buoyantly in Indian file, stretching
our legs. Occasionally there was a small opening on the
bank, made for the purpose of log-rolling, where we got
a sight of the river,&mdash;always a rocky and rippling
stream. The roar of the rapids, the note of a whistler
duck on the river, of the jay and chickadee around us,
and of the pigeon woodpecker in the openings, were the
18
sounds that we heard. This was what you might call a
bran-new country; the only roads were of Nature's
making, and the few houses were camps. Here, then,
one could no longer accuse institutions and society, but
must front the true source of evil.

There are three classes of inhabitants who either frequent
or inhabit the country which we had now entered:
first, the loggers, who, for a part of the year, the winter
and spring, are far the most numerous, but in the summer,
except a few explorers for timber, completely desert
it; second, the few settlers I have named, the only
permanent inhabitants, who live on the verge of it, and
help raise supplies for the former; third, the hunters,
mostly Indians, who range over it in their season.

At the end of three miles we came to the Mattaseunk
stream and mill, where there was even a rude wooden
railroad running down to the Penobscot, the last railroad
we were to see. We crossed one tract, on the bank
of the river, of more than a hundred acres of heavy timber,
which had just been felled and burnt over, and was
still smoking. Our trail lay through the midst of it, and
was well-nigh blotted out. The trees lay at full length,
four or five feet deep, and crossing each other in all directions,
all black as charcoal, but perfectly sound
within, still good for fuel or for timber; soon they would
be cut into lengths and burnt again. Here were thousands
of cords, enough to keep the poor of Boston and
New York amply warm for a winter, which only cumbered
the ground and were in the settler's way. And
the whole of that solid and interminable forest is doomed
to be gradually devoured thus by fire, like shavings, and
19
no man be warmed by it. At Crocker's log-hut, at the
mouth of Salmon River, seven miles from the Point,
one of the party commenced distributing a store of
small, cent picture-books among the children, to teach
them to read, and also newspapers, more or less recent,
among the parents, than which nothing can be more
acceptable to a backwoods people. It was really an important
item in our outfit, and, at times, the only currency
that would circulate. I walked through Salmon
River with my shoes on, it being low water, but not
without wetting my feet. A few miles farther we came
to "Marm Howard's," at the end of an extensive clearing,
where there were two or three log huts in sight at
once, one on the opposite side of the river, and a few
graves even, surrounded by a wooden paling, where
already the rude forefathers of a hamlet lie, and a
thousand years hence, perchance, some poet will write
his "Elergy in a Country Churchyard." The "Village
Hampdens," the "mute, inglorious Miltons," and
Cromwells, "guiltless of" their "country's blood,"
were yet unborn.



"Perchance in this wild spot there will be laid
Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire;
Hands that the rod of empire might have swayed,
Or waked to ecstasy the living lyre."


The next house was Fisk's, ten miles from the Point
at the mouth of the East Branch, opposite to the island
Nicketow, or the Forks, the last of the Indian islands.
I am particular to give the names of the settlers and the
distances, since every log hut in these woods is a public
house, and such information is of no little consequence
20
to those who may have occasion to travel this way. Our
course here crossed the Penobscot, and followed the
southern bank. One of the party, who entered the house
in search of some one to set us over, reported a very neat
dwelling, with plenty of books, and a new wife, just imported
from Boston, wholly new to the woods. We found
the East Branch a large and rapid stream at its mouth
and much deeper than it appeared. Having with some
difficulty discovered the trail again, we kept up the south
side of the West Branch, or main river, passing by some
rapids called Rock-Ebeeme, the roar of which we heard
through the woods, and, shortly after, in the thickest
of the wood, some empty loggers' camps, still new,
which were occupied the previous winter. Though we
saw a few more afterwards, I will make one account
serve for all. These were such houses as the lumberers
of Maine spend the winter in, in the wilderness. There
were the camps and the hovels for the cattle, hardly
distinguishable, except that the latter had no chimney.
These camps were about twenty feet long by fifteen
wide, built of logs,&mdash;hemlock, cedar, spruce or yellow
birch,&mdash;one kind alone, or all together, with the bark
on; two or three large ones first, one directly above another,
and notched together at the ends, to the height
of three or four feet, then of smaller logs resting upon
transverse ones at the ends, each of the last successively
shorter than the other, to form the roof. The chimney
was an oblong square hole in the middle, three or four
feet in diameter, with a fence of logs as high as the ridge.
The interstices were filled with moss, and the roof was
shingled with long and handsome splints of cedar, or
21
spruce, or pine, rifted with a sledge and cleaver. The
fireplace, the most important place of all, was in shape
and size like the chimney, and directly under it, defined
by a log fence or fender on the ground, and a heap of
ashes, a foot or two deep within, with solid benches of
split logs running round it. Here the fire usually melts
the snow, and dries the rain before it can descend to
quench it. The faded beds of arbor-vitæ leaves extended
under the eaves on either hand. There was the place
for the water-pail, pork-barrel, and wash-basin, and
generally a dingy pack of cards left on a log. Usually a
good deal of whittling was expended on the latch, which
was made of wood, in the form of an iron one. These
houses are made comfortable by the huge fires, which
can be afforded night and day. Usually the scenery
about them is drear and savage enough; and the loggers'
camp is as completely in the woods as a fungus at the
foot of a pine in a swamp; no outlook but to the sky
overhead; no more clearing than is made by cutting
down the trees of which it is built, and those which are
necessary for fuel. If only it be well sheltered and convenient
to his work, and near a spring, he wastes no
thought on the prospect. They are very proper forest
houses, the stems of the trees collected together and
piled up around a man to keep out wind and rain,&mdash;made
of living green logs, hanging with moss and lichen,
and with the curls and fringes of the yellow birch bark,
and dripping with resin, fresh and moist, and redolent
of swampy odors, with that sort of vigor and perennialness
even about them that toadstools suggest.[1] The
22
logger's fare consists of tea, molasses, flour, pork (sometimes
beef), and beans. A great proportion of the beans
raised in Massachusetts find their market here. On
expeditions it is only hard bread and pork, often raw,
slice upon slice, with tea or water, as the case may be.

The primitive wood is always and everywhere damp
and mossy, so that I traveled constantly with the impression
that I was in a swamp; and only when it was
remarked that this or that tract, judging from the quality
of the timber on it, would make a profitable clearing,
was I reminded, that if the sun were let in it would make
a dry field, like the few I had seen, at once. The best
shod for the most part travel with wet feet. If the ground
was so wet and spongy at this, the dryest part of a dry
season, what must it be in the spring? The woods hereabouts
abounded in beech and yellow birch, of which
last there were some very large specimens; also spruce,
cedar, fir, and hemlock; but we saw only the stumps
of the white pine here, some of them of great size, these
having been already culled out, being the only tree
much sought after, even as low down as this. Only a
little spruce and hemlock beside had been logged here.
The Eastern wood which is sold for fuel in Massachusetts
23
all comes from below Bangor. It was the pine
alone, chiefly the white pine, that had tempted any but
the hunter to precede us on this route.

Waite's farm, thirteen miles from the Point, is an
extensive and elevated clearing, from which we got a
fine view of the river, rippling and gleaming far beneath
us. My companions had formerly had a good
view of Ktaadn and the other mountains here, but
to-day it was so smoky that we could see nothing of
them. We could overlook an immense country of uninterrupted
forest, stretching away up the East Branch
toward Canada on the north and northwest, and toward
the Aroostook valley on the northeast; and imagine
what wild life was stirring in its midst. Here was
quite a field of corn for this region, whose peculiar dry
scent we perceived a third of a mile off, before we saw it.

Eighteen miles from the Point brought us in sight of
McCauslin's, or "Uncle George's," as he was familiarly
called by my companions, to whom he was well known,
where we intended to break our long fast. His house
was in the midst of an extensive clearing or intervale,
at the mouth of the Little Schoodic River, on the opposite
or north bank of the Penobscot. So we collected
on a point of the shore, that we might be seen, and fired
our gun as a signal, which brought out his dogs forthwith,
and thereafter their master, who in due time took
us across in his batteau. This clearing was bounded
abruptly, on all sides but the river, by the naked stems
of the forest, as if you were to cut only a few feet square
in the midst of a thousand acres of mowing, and set
down a thimble therein. He had a whole heaven and
24
horizon to himself, and the sun seemed to be journeying
over his clearing only the livelong day. Here we
concluded to spend the night, and wait for the Indians,
as there was no stopping-place so convenient above.
He had seen no Indians pass, and this did not often
happen without his knowledge. He thought that his
dogs sometimes gave notice of the approach of Indians
half an hour before they arrived.

McCauslin was a Kennebec man, of Scotch descent,
who had been a waterman twenty-two years, and had
driven on the lakes and headwaters of the Penobscot
five or six springs in succession, but was now settled
here to raise supplies for the lumberers and for himself.
He entertained us a day or two with true Scotch hospitality,
and would accept no recompense for it. A man
of a dry wit and shrewdness, and a general intelligence
which I had not looked for in the back woods. In fact,
the deeper you penetrate into the woods, the more intelligent,
and, in one sense, less countrified do you find
the inhabitants; for always the pioneer has been a
traveler, and, to some extent, a man of the world; and,
as the distances with which he is familiar are greater,
so is his information more general and far reaching
than the villager's. If I were to look for a narrow, uninformed,
and countrified mind, as opposed to the intelligence
and refinement which are thought to emanate
from cities, it would be among the rusty inhabitants
of an old-settled country, on farms all run out and
gone to seed with life-everlasting, in the towns about
Boston, even on the high-road in Concord, and not in
the back woods of Maine.
25

Supper was got before our eyes in the ample kitchen,
by a fire which would have roasted an ox; many whole
logs, four feet long, were consumed to boil our tea-kettle,&mdash;birch,
or beech, or maple, the same summer
and winter; and the dishes were soon smoking on the
table, late the arm-chair, against the wall, from which
one of the party was expelled. The arms of the chair
formed the frame on which the table rested; and, when
the round top was turned up against the wall, it formed
the back of the chair, and was no more in the way than
the wall itself. This, we noticed, was the prevailing
fashion in these log houses, in order to economize in
room. There were piping-hot wheaten cakes, the flour
having been brought up the river in batteaux,&mdash;no
Indian bread, for the upper part of Maine, it will be remembered,
is a wheat country,&mdash;and ham, eggs, and
potatoes, and milk and cheese, the produce of the farm;
and also shad and salmon, tea sweetened with molasses,
and sweet cakes, in contradistinction to the hot cakes
not sweetened, the one white, the other yellow, to wind
up with. Such we found was the prevailing fare, ordinary
and extraordinary, along this river. Mountain
cranberries (Vaccinium Vitis-Idæa), stewed and sweetened,
were the common dessert. Everything here was
in profusion, and the best of its kind. Butter was in such
plenty that it was commonly used, before it was salted,
to grease boots with.

In the night we were entertained by the sound of
rain-drops on the cedar splints which covered the roof,
and awaked the next morning with a drop or two in
our eyes. It had set in for a storm, and we made up
26
our minds not to forsake such comfortable quarters with
this prospect, but wait for Indians and fair weather. It
rained and drizzled and gleamed by turns, the livelong
day. What we did there, how we killed the time would
perhaps be idle to tell; how many times we buttered
our boots, and how often a drowsy one was seen to sidle
off to the bedroom. When it held up, I strolled up and
down the bank, and gathered the harebell and cedar
berries, which grew there; or else we tried by turns the
long-handled axe on the logs before the door. The axe-helves
here were made to chop standing on the log,&mdash;a
primitive log of course,&mdash;and were, therefore, nearly
a foot longer than with us. One while we walked over
the farm and visited his well-filled barns with McCauslin.
There were one other man and two women only
here. He kept horses, cows, oxen, and sheep. I think
he said that he was the first to bring a plow and a cow
so far; and he might have added the last, with only
two exceptions. The potato-rot had found him out here,
too, the previous year, and got half or two thirds of his
crop, though the seed was of his own raising. Oats,
grass, and potatoes were his staples; but he raised, also,
a few carrots and turnips, and "a little corn for the
hens," for this was all that he dared risk, for fear that
it would not ripen. Melons, squashes, sweet corn, beans,
tomatoes, and many other vegetables, could not be
ripened there.

The very few settlers along this stream were obviously
tempted by the cheapness of the land mainly.
When I asked McCauslin why more settlers did not
come in, he answered, that one reason was, they could
27
not buy the land, it belonged to individuals or companies
who were afraid that their wild lands would be settled,
and so incorporated into towns, and they be taxed
for them; but to settling on the State's land there was
no such hindrance. For his own part, he wanted no
neighbors,&mdash;he didn't wish to see any road by his
house. Neighbors, even the best, were a trouble and
expense, especially on the score of cattle and fences.
They might live across the river, perhaps, but not on
the same side.

The chickens here were protected by the dogs. As
McCauslin said, "The old one took it up first, and she
taught the pup, and now they had got it into their heads
that it wouldn't do to have anything of the bird kind
on the premises." A hawk hovering over was not
allowed to alight, but barked off by the dogs circling
underneath; and a pigeon, or a "yellow-hammer," as
they called the pigeon woodpecker, on a dead limb or
stump, was instantly expelled. It was the main business
of their day, and kept them constantly coming and
going. One would rush out of the house on the least
alarm given by the other.

When it rained hardest, we returned to the house,
and took down a tract from the shelf. There was the
"Wandering Jew," cheap edition, and fine print, the
"Criminal Calendar," and "Parish's Geography,"
and flash novels two or three. Under the pressure of
circumstances, we read a little in these. With such aid,
the press is not so feeble an engine, after all. This house,
which was a fair specimen of those on this river, was
built of huge logs, which peeped out everywhere, and
28
were chinked with clay and moss. It contained four or
five rooms. There were no sawed boards, or shingles,
or clapboards, about it; and scarcely any tool but the
axe had been used in its construction. The partitions
were made of long clapboard-like splints, of spruce or
cedar, turned to a delicate salmon-color by the smoke.
The roof and sides were covered with the same, instead
of shingles and clapboards, and some of a much thicker
and larger size were used for the floor. These were all
so straight and smooth, that they answered the purpose
admirably, and a careless observer would not have suspected
that they were not sawed and planed. The chimney
and hearth were of vast size, and made of stone.
The broom was a few twigs of arbor-vitæ tied to a stick;
and a pole was suspended over the hearth, close to the
ceiling, to dry stockings and clothes on. I noticed that
the floor was full of small, dingy holes, as if made with
a gimlet, but which were, in fact, made by the spikes,
nearly an inch long, which the lumberers wear in their
boots to prevent their slipping on wet logs. Just above
McCauslin's, there is a rocky rapid, where logs jam in
the spring; and many "drivers" are there collected,
who frequent his house for supplies; these were their
tracks which I saw.

At sundown McCauslin pointed away over the forest,
across the river, to signs of fair weather amid the clouds,&mdash;some
evening redness there. For even there the
points of compass held; and there was a quarter of the
heavens appropriated to sunrise and another to sunset.

The next morning, the weather proving fair enough
for our purpose, we prepared to start, and, the Indians
29
having failed us, persuaded McCauslin, who was not
unwilling to revisit the scenes of his driving, to accompany
us in their stead, intending to engage one other
boatman on the way. A strip of cotton cloth for a tent,
a couple of blankets, which would suffice for the whole
party, fifteen pounds of hard bread, ten pounds of
"clear" pork, and a little tea, made up "Uncle George's"
pack. The last three articles were calculated to be provision
enough for six men for a week, with what we
might pick up. A tea-kettle, a frying-pan, and an axe,
to be obtained at the last house, would complete our
outfit.

We were soon out of McCauslin's clearing, and in
the evergreen woods again. The obscure trail made
by the two settlers above, which even the woodman is
sometimes puzzled to discern, ere long crossed a narrow,
open strip in the woods overrun with weeds, called
the Burnt Land, where a fire had raged formerly,
stretching northward nine or ten miles, to Millinocket
Lake. At the end of three miles, we reached Shad Pond,
or Noliseemack, an expansion of the river. Hodge, the
Assistant State Geologist, who passed through this on
the 25th of June, 1837, says, "We pushed our boat
through an acre or more of buck-beans, which had taken
root at the bottom, and bloomed above the surface in
the greatest profusion and beauty." Thomas Fowler's
house is four miles from McCauslin's, on the shore of
the pond, at the mouth of the Millinocket River, and
eight miles from the lake of the same name, on the latter
stream. This lake affords a more direct course to
Ktaadn, but we preferred to follow the Penobscot and
30
the Pamadumcook lakes. Fowler was just completing
a new log hut, and was sawing out a window through
the logs, nearly two feet thick, when we arrived. He
had begun to paper his house with spruce bark, turned
inside out, which had a good effect, and was in keeping
with the circumstances. Instead of water we got here a
draught of beer, which, it was allowed, would be better;
clear and thin, but strong and stringent as the cedar sap.
It was as if we sucked at the very teats of Nature's pine-clad
bosom in these parts,&mdash;the sap of all Millinocket
botany commingled,&mdash;the topmost, most fantastic,
and spiciest sprays of the primitive wood, and whatever
invigorating and stringent gum or essence it afforded
steeped and dissolved in it,&mdash;a lumberer's drink, which
would acclimate and naturalize a man at once,&mdash;which
would make him see green, and, if he slept, dream that
he heard the wind sough among the pines. Here was a
fife, praying to be played on, through which we breathed
a few tuneful strains,&mdash;brought hither to tame wild
beasts. As we stood upon the pile of chips by the door,
fish hawks were sailing overhead; and here, over Shad
Pond, might daily be witnessed the tyranny of the bald
eagle over that bird. Tom pointed away over the lake
to a bald eagle's nest, which was plainly visible more
than a mile off, on a pine, high above the surrounding
forest, and was frequented from year to year by the same
pair, and held sacred by him. There were these two
houses only there, his low hut and the eagles' airy cart-load
of fagots. Thomas Fowler, too, was persuaded to
join us, for two men were necessary to manage the batteau,
which was soon to be our carriage, and these men
31
needed to be cool and skillful for the navigation of the
Penobscot. Tom's pack was soon made, for he had not
far to look for his waterman's boots, and a red flannel
shirt. This is the favorite color with lumbermen; and
red flannel is reputed to possess some mysterious virtues,
to be most healthful and convenient in respect to
perspiration. In every gang there will be a large proportion
of red birds. We took here a poor and leaky
batteau, and began to pole up the Millinocket two miles,
to the elder Fowler's, in order to avoid the Grand Falls
of the Penobscot, intending to exchange our batteau
there for a better. The Millinocket is a small, shallow,
and sandy stream, full of what I took to be lamprey-eels'
or suckers' nests, and lined with musquash-cabins,
but free from rapids, according to Fowler, excepting at
its outlet from the lake. He was at this time engaged
in cutting the native grass&mdash;rush-grass and meadow-clover,
as he called it&mdash;on the meadows and small, low
islands of this stream. We noticed flattened places in
the grass on either side, where, he said, a moose had
laid down the night before, adding, that there were
thousands in these meadows.

Old Fowler's, on the Millinocket, six miles from
McCauslin's, and twenty-four from the Point, is the
last house. Gibson's, on the Sowadnehunk, is the only
clearing above, but that had proved a failure, and was
long since deserted. Fowler is the oldest inhabitant of
these woods. He formerly lived a few miles from here,
on the south side of the West Branch, where he built his
house sixteen years ago, the first house built above the
Five Islands. Here our new batteau was to be carried
32
over the first portage of two miles, round the Grand
Falls of the Penobscot, on a horse-sled made of saplings,
to jump the numerous rocks in the way; but we had to
wait a couple of hours for them to catch the horses,
which were pastured at a distance, amid the stumps, and
had wandered still farther off. The last of the salmon
for this season had just been caught, and were still fresh
in pickle, from which enough was extracted to fill our
empty kettle, and so graduate our introduction to simpler
forest fare. The week before they had lost nine
sheep here out of their first flock, by the wolves. The
surviving sheep came round the house, and seemed
frightened, which induced them to go and look for the
rest, when they found seven dead and lacerated, and
two still alive. These last they carried to the house, and,
as Mrs. Fowler said, they were merely scratched in the
throat, and had no more visible wound than would be
produced by the prick of a pin. She sheared off the wool
from their throats, and washed them, and put on some
salve, and turned them out, but in a few moments they
were missing, and had not been found since. In fact,
they were all poisoned, and those that were found swelled
up at once, so that they saved neither skin nor wool.
This realized the old fables of the wolves and the sheep,
and convinced me that that ancient hostility still existed.
Verily, the shepherd-boy did not need to sound
a false alarm this time. There were steel traps by the
door, of various sizes, for wolves, otter, and bears, with
large claws instead of teeth, to catch in their sinews.
Wolves are frequently killed with poisoned bait.

At length, after we had dined here on the usual backwoods
33
fare, the horses arrived, and we hauled our batteau
out of the water, and lashed it to its wicker carriage,
and, throwing in our packs, walked on before, leaving
the boatmen and driver, who was Tom's brother, to
manage the concern. The route, which led through the
wild pasture where the sheep were killed, was in some
places the roughest ever traveled by horses, over rocky
hills, where the sled bounced and slid along, like a vessel
pitching in a storm; and one man was as necessary
to stand at the stern, to prevent the boat from being
wrecked, as a helmsman in the roughest sea. The philosophy
of our progress was something like this: when
the runners struck a rock three or four feet high, the
sled bounced back and upwards at the same time; but,
as the horses never ceased pulling, it came down on
the top of the rock, and so we got over. This portage
probably followed the trail of an ancient Indian carry
round these falls. By two o'clock we, who had walked
on before, reached the river above the falls, not far from
the outlet of Quakish Lake, and waited for the batteau
to come up. We had been here but a short time, when
a thunder-shower was seen coming up from the west,
over the still invisible lakes, and that pleasant wilderness
which we were so eager to become acquainted with;
and soon the heavy drops began to patter on the leaves
around us. I had just selected the prostrate trunk of a
huge pine, five or six feet in diameter, and was crawling
under it, when, luckily, the boat arrived. It would have
amused a sheltered man to witness the manner in which
it was unlashed, and whirled over, while the first waterspout
burst upon us. It was no sooner in the hands of
34
the eager company than it was abandoned to the first
revolutionary impulse, and to gravity, to adjust it; and
they might have been seen all stooping to its shelter, and
wriggling under like so many eels, before it was fairly
deposited on the ground. When all were under, we
propped up the lee side, and busied ourselves there
whittling thole-pins for rowing, when we should reach
the lakes; and made the woods ring, between the claps
of thunder, with such boat-songs as we could remember.
The horses stood sleek and shining with the rain,
all drooping and crestfallen, while deluge after deluge
washed over us; but the bottom of a boat may be
relied on for a tight roof. At length, after two hours'
delay at this place, a streak of fair weather appeared
in the northwest, whither our course now lay, promising
a serene evening for our voyage; and the driver
returned with his horses, while we made haste to launch
our boat, and commence our voyage in good earnest.

There were six of us, including the two boatmen.
With our packs heaped up near the bows, and ourselves
disposed as baggage to trim the boat, with instructions
not to move in case we should strike a rock, more than
so many barrels of pork, we pushed out into the first
rapid, a slight specimen of the stream we had to navigate.
With Uncle George in the stern, and Tom in the
bows, each using a spruce pole about twelve feet long,
pointed with iron,[2] and poling on the same side, we
shot up the rapids like a salmon, the water rushing and
roaring around, so that only a practiced eye could distinguish
a safe course, or tell what was deep water and
35
what rocks, frequently grazing the latter on one or both
sides, with a hundred as narrow escapes as ever the Argo
had in passing through the Symplegades. I, who had
had some experience in boating, had never experienced
any half so exhilarating before. We were lucky to have
exchanged our Indians, whom we did not know, for
these men, who, together with Tom's brother, were
reputed the best boatmen on the river, and were at
once indispensable pilots and pleasant companions.
The canoe is smaller, more easily upset, and sooner
worn out; and the Indian is said not to be so skillful
in the management of the batteau. He is, for the
most part, less to be relied on, and more disposed
to sulks and whims. The utmost familiarity with dead
streams, or with the ocean, would not prepare a
man for this peculiar navigation; and the most skillful
boatman anywhere else would here be obliged to
take out his boat and carry round a hundred times,
still with great risk, as well as delay, where the practiced
batteau-man poles up with comparative ease and
safety. The hardy "voyageur" pushes with incredible
perseverance and success quite up to the foot of the
falls, and then only carries round some perpendicular
ledge, and launches again in



"The torrent's smoothness, ere it dash below,"

to struggle with the boiling rapids above. The Indians
say that the river once ran both ways, one half up
and the other down, but that, since the white man
came, it all runs down, and now they must laboriously
pole their canoes against the stream, and carry them
36
over numerous portages. In the summer, all stores&mdash;the
grindstone and the plow of the pioneer, flour, pork,
and utensils for the explorer&mdash;must be conveyed up
the river in batteaux; and many a cargo and many a
boatman is lost in these waters. In the winter, however,
which is very equable and long, the ice is the great
highway, and the loggers' team penetrates to Chesuncook
Lake, and still higher up, even two hundred miles
above Bangor. Imagine the solitary sled-track running
far up into the snowy and evergreen wilderness,
hemmed in closely for a hundred miles by the forest,
and again stretching straight across the broad surfaces
of concealed lakes!

We were soon in the smooth water of the Quakish
Lake, and took our turns at rowing and paddling across
it. It is a small, irregular, but handsome lake, shut in
on all sides by the forest, and showing no traces of man
but some low boom in a distant cove, reserved for
spring use. The spruce and cedar on its shores, hung
with gray lichens, looked at a distance like the ghosts
of trees. Ducks were sailing here and there on its
surface, and a solitary loon, like a more living wave,&mdash;a
vital spot on the lake's surface,&mdash;laughed and
frolicked, and showed its straight leg, for our amusement.
Joe Merry Mountain appeared in the northwest,
as if it were looking down on this lake especially; and
we had our first, but a partial view of Ktaadn, its summit
veiled in clouds, like a dark isthmus in that quarter,
connecting the heavens with the earth. After two miles
of smooth rowing across this lake, we found ourselves
in the river again, which was a continuous rapid for one
37
mile, to the dam, requiring all the strength and skill of
our boatmen to pole up it.

This dam is a quite important and expensive work
for this country, whither cattle and horses cannot penetrate
in the summer, raising the whole river ten feet,
and flooding, as they said, some sixty square miles by
means of the innumerable lakes with which the river
connects. It is a lofty and solid structure, with sloping
piers, some distance above, made of frames of logs
filled with stones, to break the ice.[3] Here every log
pays toll as it passes through the sluices.

We filed into the rude loggers' camp at this place,
such as I have described, without ceremony, and the
cook, at that moment the sole occupant, at once set
about preparing tea for his visitors. His fireplace,
which the rain had converted into a mud-puddle, was
soon blazing again, and we sat down on the log benches
around it to dry us. On the well-flattened and somewhat
faded beds of arbor-vitæ leaves, which stretched
on either hand under the eaves behind us, lay an odd
leaf of the Bible, some genealogical chapter out of the
Old Testament; and, half buried by the leaves, we
found Emerson's Address on West India Emancipation,
which had been left here formerly by one of our company,
and had made two converts to the Liberty party
here, as I was told; also, an odd number of the Westminster
Review, for 1834, and a pamphlet entitled
38
"History of the Erection of the Monument on the Grave
of Myron Holly." This was the readable or reading
matter in a lumberer's camp in the Maine woods,
thirty miles from a road, which would be given up to
the bears in a fortnight. These things were well
thumbed and soiled. This gang was headed by one
John Morrison, a good specimen of a Yankee; and was
necessarily composed of men not bred to the business of
dam-building, but who were jacks-at-all-trades, handy
with the axe, and other simple implements, and well
skilled in wood and water craft. We had hot cakes
for our supper even here, white as snowballs, but without
butter, and the never-failing sweet cakes, with which
we filled our pockets, foreseeing that we should not
soon meet with the like again. Such delicate puffballs
seemed a singular diet for backwoodsmen. There was
also tea without milk, sweetened with molasses. And so,
exchanging a word with John Morrison and his gang
when we had returned to the shore, and also exchanging
our batteau for a better still, we made haste to
improve the little daylight that remained. This camp,
exactly twenty-nine miles from Mattawamkeag Point
by the way we had come, and about one hundred from
Bangor by the river, was the last human habitation of
any kind in this direction. Beyond, there was no trail,
and the river and lakes, by batteaux and canoes, was
considered the only practicable route. We were about
thirty miles by the river from the summit of Ktaadn,
which was in sight, though not more than twenty, perhaps,
in a straight line.

It being about the full of the moon, and a warm and
39
pleasant evening, we decided to row five miles by moonlight
to the head of the North Twin Lake, lest the wind
should rise on the morrow. After one mile of river, or
what the boatmen call "thoroughfare,"&mdash;for the river
becomes at length only the connecting link between the
lakes,&mdash;and some slight rapid which had been mostly
made smooth water by the dam, we entered the North
Twin Lake just after sundown, and steered across for
the river "thoroughfare," four miles distant. This is a
noble sheet of water, where one may get the impression
which a new country and a "lake of the woods" are
fitted to create. There was the smoke of no log hut
nor camp of any kind to greet us, still less was any
lover of nature or musing traveler watching our batteau
from the distant hills; not even the Indian hunter was
there, for he rarely climbs them, but hugs the river
like ourselves. No face welcomed us but the fine fantastic
sprays of free and happy evergreen trees, waving
one above another in their ancient home. At first the
red clouds hung over the western shore as gorgeously
as if over a city, and the lake lay open to the light
with even a civilized aspect, as if expecting trade and
commerce, and towns and villas. We could distinguish
the inlet to the South Twin, which is said to
be the larger, where the shore was misty and blue, and
it was worth the while to look thus through a narrow
opening across the entire expanse of a concealed lake
to its own yet more dim and distant shore. The shores
rose gently to ranges of low hills covered with forests;
and though, in fact, the most valuable white-pine timber,
even about this lake, had been culled out, this would
40
never have been suspected by the voyager. The impression,
which indeed corresponded with the fact, was, as
if we were upon a high table-land between the States
and Canada, the northern side of which is drained by
the St. John and Chaudière, the southern by the Penobscot
and Kennebec. There was no bold, mountainous
shore, as we might have expected, but only isolated
hills and mountains rising here and there from the
plateau. The country is an archipelago of lakes,&mdash;the
lake-country of New England. Their levels vary
but a few feet, and the boatmen, by short portages, or
by none at all, pass easily from one to another. They
say that at very high water the Penobscot and the
Kennebec flow into each other, or at any rate, that you
may lie with your face in the one and your toes in the
other. Even the Penobscot and St. John have been
connected by a canal, so that the lumber of the Allegash,
instead of going down the St. John, comes down
the Penobscot; and the Indian's tradition, that the
Penobscot once ran both ways for his convenience, is, in
one sense, partially realized to-day.

None of our party but McCauslin had been above
this lake, so we trusted to him to pilot us, and we could
not but confess the importance of a pilot on these
waters. While it is river, you will not easily forget
which way is up-stream; but when you enter a lake,
the river is completely lost, and you scan the distant
shores in vain to find where it comes in. A stranger is,
for the time at least, lost, and must set about a voyage
of discovery first of all to find the river. To follow the
windings of the shore when the lake is ten miles, or
41
even more, in length, and of an irregularity which will
not soon be mapped, is a wearisome voyage, and will
spend his time and his provisions. They tell a story of
a gang of experienced woodmen sent to a location on
this stream, who were thus lost in the wilderness of
lakes. They cut their way through thickets, and carried
their baggage and their boats over from lake to lake,
sometimes several miles. They carried into Millinocket
Lake, which is on another stream, and is ten miles
square, and contains a hundred islands. They explored
its shores thoroughly, and then carried into another,
and another, and it was a week of toil and anxiety
before they found the Penobscot River again, and then
their provisions were exhausted, and they were obliged
to return.

While Uncle George steered for a small island near
the head of the lake, now just visible, like a speck on
the water, we rowed by turns swiftly over its surface,
singing such boat songs as we could remember. The
shores seemed at an indefinite distance in the moonlight.
Occasionally we paused in our singing and rested on
our oars, while we listened to hear if the wolves howled,
for this is a common serenade, and my companions
affirmed that it was the most dismal and unearthly of
sounds; but we heard none this time. If we did not
hear, however, we did listen, not without a reasonable
expectation; that at least I have to tell,&mdash;only some
utterly uncivilized, big-throated owl hooted loud and
dismally in the drear and boughy wilderness, plainly
not nervous about his solitary life, nor afraid to hear
the echoes of his voice there. We remembered also that
42
possibly moose were silently watching us from the
distant coves, or some surly bear or timid caribou had
been startled by our singing. It was with new emphasis
that we sang there the Canadian boat song,&mdash;



"Row, brothers, row, the stream runs fast,
The rapids are near and the daylight's past!"


which describes precisely our own adventure, and was
inspired by the experience of a similar kind of life,&mdash;for
the rapids were ever near, and the daylight long past;
the woods on shore looked dim, and many an Utawas'
tide here emptied into the lake.




"Why should we yet our sail unfurl?
There is not a breath the blue wave to curl!
But, when the wind blows off the shore,
Oh, sweetly we'll rest our weary oar."


"Utawas' tide! this trembling moon
Shall see us float o'er thy surges soon."


At last we glided past the "green isle," which had
been our landmark, all joining in the chorus; as if by
the watery links of rivers and of lakes we were about
to float over unmeasured zones of earth, bound on unimaginable
adventures,&mdash;



"Saint of this green isle! hear our prayers,
Oh, grant us cool heavens and favoring airs!"


About nine o'clock we reached the river, and ran
our boat into a natural haven between some rocks,
and drew her out on the sand. This camping-ground
McCauslin had been familiar with in his lumbering
days, and he now struck it unerringly in the moonlight,
and we heard the sound of the rill which would supply
43
us with cool water emptying into the lake. The first
business was to make a fire, an operation which was a
little delayed by the wetness of the fuel and the ground,
owing to the heavy showers of the afternoon. The fire
is the main comfort of the camp, whether in summer
or winter, and is about as ample at one season as at
another. It is as well for cheerfulness as for warmth
and dryness. It forms one side of the camp; one bright
side at any rate. Some were dispersed to fetch in dead
trees and boughs, while Uncle George felled the birches
and beeches which stood convenient, and soon we had
a fire some ten feet long by three or four high, which
rapidly dried the sand before it. This was calculated
to burn all night. We next proceeded to pitch our tent;
which operation was performed by sticking our two
spike-poles into the ground in a slanting direction,
about ten feet apart, for rafters, and then drawing our
cotton cloth over them, and tying it down at the ends,
leaving it open in front, shed-fashion. But this evening
the wind carried the sparks on to the tent and burned
it. So we hastily drew up the batteau just within the
edge of the woods before the fire, and propping up
one side three or four feet high, spread the tent on the
ground to lie on; and with the corner of a blanket, or
what more or less we could get to put over us, lay down
with our heads and bodies under the boat, and our
feet and legs on the sand toward the fire. At first we
lay awake, talking of our course, and finding ourselves
in so convenient a posture for studying the heavens,
with the moon and stars shining in our faces, our conversation
naturally turned upon astronomy, and we
44
recounted by turns the most interesting discoveries in
that science. But at length we composed ourselves
seriously to sleep. It was interesting, when awakened
at midnight, to watch the grotesque and fiend-like
forms and motions of some one of the party, who, not
being able to sleep, had got up silently to arouse the
fire, and add fresh fuel, for a change; now stealthily
lugging a dead tree from out the dark, and heaving it
on, now stirring up the embers with his fork, or tiptoeing
about to observe the stars, watched, perchance, by
half the prostrate party in breathless silence; so much
the more intense because they were awake, while each
supposed his neighbor sound asleep. Thus aroused, I,
too, brought fresh fuel to the fire, and then rambled
along the sandy shore in the moonlight, hoping to meet
a moose come down to drink, or else a wolf. The little
rill tinkled the louder, and peopled all the wilderness
for me; and the glassy smoothness of the sleeping lake,
laving the shores of a new world, with the dark, fantastic
rocks rising here and there from its surface,
made a scene not easily described. It has left such an
impression of stern, yet gentle, wildness on my memory
as will not soon be effaced. Not far from midnight we
were one after another awakened by rain falling on our
extremities; and as each was made aware of the fact
by cold or wet, he drew a long sigh and then drew up
his legs, until gradually we had all sidled round from
lying at right angles with the boat, till our bodies
formed an acute angle with it, and were wholly protected.
When next we awoke, the moon and stars were
shining again, and there were signs of dawn in the
45
east. I have been thus particular in order to convey
some idea of a night in the woods.

We had soon launched and loaded our boat, and,
leaving our fire blazing, were off again before breakfast.
The lumberers rarely trouble themselves to put
out their fires, such is the dampness of the primitive
forest; and this is one cause, no doubt, of the frequent
fires in Maine, of which we hear so much on smoky
days in Massachusetts. The forests are held cheap
after the white pine has been culled out; and the explorers
and hunters pray for rain only to clear the
atmosphere of smoke. The woods were so wet to-day,
however, that there was no danger of our fire spreading.
After poling up half a mile of river, or thoroughfare,
we rowed a mile across the foot of Pamadumcook
Lake, which is the name given on the map to this
whole chain of lakes, as if there was but one, though
they are, in each instance, distinctly separated by a
reach of the river, with its narrow and rocky channel
and its rapids. This lake, which is one of the largest,
stretched northwest ten miles, to hills and mountains
in the distance. McCauslin pointed to some distant,
and as yet inaccessible, forests of white pine, on the
sides of a mountain in that direction. The Joe Merry
Lakes, which lay between us and Moosehead, on the
west, were recently, if they are not still, "surrounded
by some of the best timbered land in the State." By
another thoroughfare we passed into Deep Cove, a part
of the same lake, which makes up two miles, toward
the northeast, and rowing two miles across this, by
another short thoroughfare, entered Ambejijis Lake.
46

At the entrance to a lake we sometimes observed
what is technically called "fencing-stuff," or the unhewn
timbers of which booms are formed, either secured
together in the water, or laid up on the rocks
and lashed to trees, for spring use. But it was always
startling to discover so plain a trail of civilized man
there. I remember that I was strangely affected, when
we were returning, by the sight of a ring-bolt well
drilled into a rock, and fastened with lead, at the head
of this solitary Ambejijis Lake.

It was easy to see that driving logs must be an exciting
as well as arduous and dangerous business. All
winter long the logger goes on piling up the trees which
he has trimmed and hauled in some dry ravine at the
head of a stream, and then in the spring he stands on
the bank and whistles for Rain and Thaw, ready to
wring the perspiration out of his shirt to swell the tide,
till suddenly, with a whoop and halloo from him, shutting
his eyes, as if to bid farewell to the existing state
of things, a fair proportion of his winter's work goes
scrambling down the country, followed by his faithful
dogs, Thaw and Rain and Freshet and Wind, the whole
pack in full cry, toward the Orono Mills. Every log is
marked with the owner's name, cut in the sapwood
with an axe or bored with an auger, so deep as not to
be worn off in the driving, and yet not so as to injure
the timber; and it requires considerable ingenuity to
invent new and simple marks where there are so many
owners. They have quite an alphabet of their own,
which only the practiced can read. One of my companions
read off from his memorandum book some
47
marks of his own logs, among which there were crosses,
belts, crow's feet, girdles, etc., as, "Y&mdash;girdle&mdash;crowfoot,"
and various other devices. When the logs have
run the gauntlet of innumerable rapids and falls, each
on its own account, with more or less jamming and
bruising, those bearing various owners' marks being
mixed up together,&mdash;since all must take advantage of
the same freshet,&mdash;they are collected together at the
heads of the lakes, and surrounded by a boom fence of
floating logs, to prevent their being dispersed by the
wind, and are thus towed all together, like a flock of
sheep, across the lake, where there is no current, by
a windlass, or boom-head, such as we sometimes saw
standing on an island or headland, and, if circumstances
permit, with the aid of sails and oars. Sometimes,
notwithstanding, the logs are dispersed over many
miles of lake surface in a few hours by winds and freshets,
and thrown up on distant shores, where the driver
can pick up only one or two at a time, and return with
them to the thoroughfare; and before he gets his flock
well through Ambejijis or Pamadumcook, he makes
many a wet and uncomfortable camp on the shore. He
must be able to navigate a log as if it were a canoe,
and be as indifferent to cold and wet as a muskrat.
He uses a few efficient tools,&mdash;a lever commonly of
rock maple, six or seven feet long, with a stout spike
in it, strongly ferruled on, and a long spike-pole, with
a screw at the end of the spike to make it hold. The
boys along shore learn to walk on floating logs as city
boys on sidewalks. Sometimes the logs are thrown up
on rocks in such positions as to be irrecoverable but by
48
another freshet as high, or they jam together at rapids
and falls, and accumulate in vast piles, which the driver
must start at the risk of his life. Such is the lumber
business, which depends on many accidents, as the
early freezing of the rivers, that the teams may get up
in season, a sufficient freshet in the spring, to fetch the
logs down, and many others.[4] I quote Michaux on
Lumbering on the Kennebec, then the source of the
best white pine lumber carried to England. "The persons
engaged in this branch of industry are generally
emigrants from New Hampshire.... In the summer
they unite in small companies, and traverse these vast
solitudes in every direction, to ascertain the places in
which the pines abound. After cutting the grass and
converting it into hay for the nourishment of the cattle
to be employed in their labor, they return home. In
the beginning of the winter they enter the forests again,
establish themselves in huts covered with the bark of
the canoe-birch, or the arbor-vitæ; and, though the cold
is so intense that the mercury sometimes remains for
several weeks from 40° to 50° [Fahr.] below the point
of congelation, they persevere, with unabated courage,
in their work." According to Springer, the company
consists of choppers, swampers,&mdash;who make roads,&mdash;barker
and loader, teamster, and cook. "When the
49
trees are felled, they cut them into logs from fourteen
to eighteen feet long, and, by means of their cattle,
which they employ with great dexterity, drag them to
the river, and, after stamping on them a mark of property,
roll them on its frozen bosom. At the breaking
of the ice, in the spring, they float down with the current....
The logs that are not drawn the first year,"
adds Michaux, "are attacked by large worms, which
form holes about two lines in diameter, in every direction;
but, if stripped of their bark, they will remain
uninjured for thirty years."

Ambejijis, this quiet Sunday morning, struck me as
the most beautiful lake we had seen. It is said to be
one of the deepest. We had the fairest view of Joe
Merry, Double Top, and Ktaadn, from its surface. The
summit of the latter had a singularly flat, table-land
appearance, like a short highway, where a demigod
might be let down to take a turn or two in an afternoon,
to settle his dinner. We rowed a mile and a half to near
the head of the lake, and, pushing through a field of lily-pads,
landed, to cook our breakfast, by the side of a large
rock, known to McCauslin. Our breakfast consisted
of tea, with hard-bread and pork, and fried salmon,
which we ate with forks neatly whittled from alder
twigs, which grew there, off strips of birch-bark for
plates. The tea was black tea, without milk to color or
sugar to sweeten it, and two tin dippers were our tea
cups. This beverage is as indispensable to the loggers
as to any gossiping old women in the land, and they,
no doubt, derive great comfort from it. Here was the
site of an old logger's camp, remembered by McCauslin,
50
now overgrown with weeds and bushes. In the midst
of a dense underwood we noticed a whole brick, on a
rock, in a small run, clean and red and square as in
a brick-yard, which had been brought thus far formerly
for tamping. Some of us afterward regretted that we
had not carried this on with us to the top of the mountain,
to be left there for our mark. It would certainly
have been a simple evidence of civilized man. McCauslin
said that large wooden crosses, made of oak, still
sound, were sometimes found standing in this wilderness,
which were set up by the first Catholic missionaries
who came through to the Kennebec.

In the next nine miles, which were the extent of our
voyage, and which it took us the rest of the day to get
over, we rowed across several small lakes, poled up
numerous rapids and thoroughfares, and carried over
four portages. I will give the names and distances, for
the benefit of future tourists. First, after leaving
Ambejijis Lake, we had a quarter of a mile of rapids
to the portage, or carry of ninety rods around Ambejijis
Falls; then a mile and a half through Passamagamet
Lake, which is narrow and river-like, to the
falls of the same name,&mdash;Ambejijis stream coming in
on the right; then two miles through Katepskonegan
Lake to the portage of ninety rods around Katepskonegan
Falls, which name signifies "carrying-place,"&mdash;Passamagamet
stream coming in on the left; then three
miles through Pockwockomus Lake, a slight expansion
of the river, to the portage of forty rods around the
falls of the same name,&mdash;Katepskonegan stream coming
in on the left; then three quarters of a mile through
51
Aboljacarmegus Lake, similar to the last, to the portage
of forty rods around the falls of the same name; then
half a mile of rapid water to the Sowadnehunk deadwater,
and the Aboljacknagesic stream.

This is generally the order of names as you ascend
the river: First, the lake, or, if there is no expansion,
the deadwater; then the falls; then the stream emptying
into the lake, or river above, all of the same name.
First we came to Passamagamet Lake, then to Passamagamet
Falls, then to Passamagamet Stream, emptying
in. This order and identity of names, it will be
perceived, is quite philosophical, since the deadwater
or lake is always at least partially produced by the
stream emptying in above; and the first fall below,
which is the outlet of that lake, and where that tributary
water makes its first plunge, also naturally bears
the same name.

At the portage around Ambejijis Falls I observed
a pork-barrel on the shore, with a hole eight or nine
inches square cut in one side, which was set against an
upright rock; but the bears, without turning or upsetting
the barrel, had gnawed a hole in the opposite side,
which looked exactly like an enormous rat-hole, big
enough to put their heads in; and at the bottom of the
barrel were still left a few mangled and slabbered slices
of pork. It is usual for the lumberers to leave such
supplies as they cannot conveniently carry along with
them at carries or camps, to which the next comers do
not scruple to help themselves, they being the property,
commonly, not of an individual, but a company, who
can afford to deal liberally.
52

I will describe particularly how we got over some of
these portages and rapids, in order that the reader may
get an idea of the boatman's life. At Ambejijis Falls,
for instance, there was the roughest path imaginable
cut through the woods; at first up hill, at an angle of
nearly forty-five degrees, over rocks and logs without
end. This was the manner of the portage. We first
carried over our baggage, and deposited it on the shore
at the other end; then, returning to the batteau, we
dragged it up the hill by the painter, and onward, with
frequent pauses, over half the portage. But this was a
bungling way, and would soon have worn out the boat.
Commonly, three men walk over with a batteau weighing
from three to five or six hundred pounds on their
heads and shoulders, the tallest standing under the
middle of the boat, which is turned over, and one at
each end, or else there are two at the bows. More
cannot well take hold at once. But this requires some
practice, as well as strength, and is in any case extremely
laborious, and wearing to the constitution, to
follow. We were, on the whole, rather an invalid party,
and could render our boatmen but little assistance.
Our two men at length took the batteau upon their
shoulders, and, while two of us steadied it, to prevent
it from rocking and wearing into their shoulders, on
which they placed their hats folded, walked bravely
over the remaining distance, with two or three pauses.
In the same manner they accomplished the other portages.
With this crushing weight they must climb and
stumble along over fallen trees and slippery rocks of
all sizes, where those who walked by the sides were
53
continually brushed off, such was the narrowness of
the path. But we were fortunate not to have to cut
our path in the first place. Before we launched our
boat, we scraped the bottom smooth again, with our
knives, where it had rubbed on the rocks, to save
friction.

To avoid the difficulties of the portage, our men determined
to "warp up" the Passamagamet Falls; so
while the rest walked over the portage with the baggage,
I remained in the batteau, to assist in warping
up. We were soon in the midst of the rapids, which
were more swift and tumultuous than any we had
poled up, and had turned to the side of the stream
for the purpose of warping, when the boatmen, who felt
some pride in their skill, and were ambitious to do
something more than usual, for my benefit, as I surmised,
took one more view of the rapids, or rather
the falls; and, in answer to our question, whether we
couldn't get up there, the other answered that he
guessed he'd try it. So we pushed again into the midst
of the stream, and began to struggle with the current.
I sat in the middle of the boat to trim it, moving
slightly to the right or left as it grazed a rock. With
an uncertain and wavering motion we wound and
bolted our way up, until the bow was actually raised two
feet above the stern at the steepest pitch; and then,
when everything depended upon his exertions, the bowman's
pole snapped in two; but before he had time
to take the spare one, which I reached him, he had
saved himself with the fragment upon a rock; and so
we got up by a hair's breadth; and Uncle George exclaimed
54
that that was never done before, and he had
not tried it if he had not known whom he had got in
the bow, nor he in the bow, if he had not known him
in the stern. At this place there was a regular portage
cut through the woods, and our boatmen had never
known a batteau to ascend the falls. As near as I can
remember, there was a perpendicular fall here, at the
worst place of the whole Penobscot River, two or three
feet at least. I could not sufficiently admire the skill
and coolness with which they performed this feat,
never speaking to each other. The bowman, not looking
behind, but knowing exactly what the other is
about, works as if he worked alone. Now sounding in
vain for a bottom in fifteen feet of water, while the
boat falls back several rods, held straight only with
the greatest skill and exertion; or, while the sternman
obstinately holds his ground, like a turtle, the bowman
springs from side to side with wonderful suppleness
and dexterity, scanning the rapids and the rocks with
a thousand eyes; and now, having got a bite at last,
with a lusty shove, which makes his pole bend and
quiver, and the whole boat tremble, he gains a few
feet upon the river. To add to the danger, the poles
are liable at any time to be caught between the rocks,
and wrenched out of their hands, leaving them at the
mercy of the rapids,&mdash;the rocks, as it were, lying in
wait, like so many alligators, to catch them in their
teeth, and jerk them from your hands, before you have
stolen an effectual shove against their palates. The
pole is set close to the boat, and the prow is made to
overshoot, and just turn the corners of the rocks, in
55
the very teeth of the rapids. Nothing but the length
and lightness, and the slight draught of the batteau,
enables them to make any headway. The bowman
must quickly choose his course; there is no time to
deliberate. Frequently the boat is shoved between
rocks where both sides touch, and the waters on either
hand are a perfect maelstrom.

Half a mile above this two of us tried our hands at
poling up a slight rapid; and we were just surmounting
the last difficulty, when an unlucky rock confounded our
calculations; and while the batteau was sweeping round
irrecoverably amid the whirlpool, we were obliged to
resign the poles to more skillful hands.

Katepskonegan is one of the shallowest and weediest
of the lakes, and looked as if it might abound in
pickerel. The falls of the same name, where we stopped
to dine, are considerable and quite picturesque. Here
Uncle George had seen trout caught by the barrelful;
but they would not rise to our bait at this hour. Halfway
over this carry, thus far in the Maine wilderness
on its way to the Provinces, we noticed a large, flaming,
Oak Hall handbill, about two feet long, wrapped round
the trunk of a pine, from which the bark had been
stripped, and to which it was fast glued by the pitch.
This should be recorded among the advantages of this
mode of advertising, that so, possibly, even the bears
and wolves, moose, deer, otter, and beaver, not to mention
the Indian, may learn where they can fit themselves
according to the latest fashion, or, at least, recover
some of their own lost garments. We christened this
the Oak Hall carry.
56

The forenoon was as serene and placid on this wild
stream in the woods, as we are apt to imagine that Sunday
in summer usually is in Massachusetts. We were
occasionally startled by the scream of a bald eagle,
sailing over the stream in front of our batteau; or of
the fish hawks on whom he levies his contributions.
There were, at intervals, small meadows of a few acres
on the sides of the stream, waving with uncut grass,
which attracted the attention of our boatmen, who regretted
that they were not nearer to their clearings,
and calculated how many stacks they might cut. Two
or three men sometimes spend the summer by themselves,
cutting the grass in these meadows, to sell to
the loggers in the winter, since it will fetch a higher
price on the spot than in any market in the State. On
a small isle, covered with this kind of rush, or cut-grass,
on which we landed to consult about our further course,
we noticed the recent track of a moose, a large, roundish
hole in the soft, wet ground, evincing the great size
and weight of the animal that made it. They are fond
of the water, and visit all these island meadows, swimming
as easily from island to island as they make their
way through the thickets on land. Now and then we
passed what McCauslin called a pokelogan, an Indian
term for what the drivers might have reason to call a
poke-logs-in, an inlet that leads nowhere. If you get in,
you have got to get out again the same way. These,
and the frequent "runrounds" which come into the
river again, would embarrass an inexperienced voyager
not a little.

The carry around Pockwockomus Falls was exceedingly
57
rough and rocky, the batteau having to be lifted
directly from the water up four or five feet on to a rock,
and launched again down a similar bank. The rocks
on this portage were covered with the dents made by
the spikes in the lumberers' boots while staggering
over under the weight of their batteaux; and you could
see where the surface of some large rocks on which
they had rested their batteaux was worn quite smooth
with use. As it was, we had carried over but half the
usual portage at this place for this stage of the water,
and launched our boat in the smooth wave just curving
to the fall, prepared to struggle with the most violent
rapid we had to encounter. The rest of the party
walked over the remainder of the portage, while I remained
with the boatmen to assist in warping up. One
had to hold the boat while the others got in to prevent
it from going over the falls. When we had pushed up
the rapids as far as possible, keeping close to the shore,
Tom seized the painter and leaped out upon a rock
just visible in the water, but he lost his footing, notwithstanding
his spiked boots, and was instantly amid
the rapids; but recovering himself by good luck, and
reaching another rock, he passed the painter to me,
who had followed him, and took his place again in the
bows. Leaping from rock to rock in the shoal water,
close to the shore, and now and then getting a bite
with the rope round an upright one, I held the boat
while one reset his pole, and then all three forced it
upward against any rapid. This was "warping up."
When a part of us walked round at such a place, we
generally took the precaution to take out the most
58
valuable part of the baggage for fear of being
swamped.

As we poled up a swift rapid for half a mile above
Aboljacarmegus Falls, some of the party read their
own marks on the huge logs which lay piled up high
and dry on the rocks on either hand, the relics probably
of a jam which had taken place here in the Great
Freshet in the spring. Many of these would have to
wait for another great freshet, perchance, if they lasted
so long, before they could be got off. It was singular
enough to meet with property of theirs which they had
never seen, and where they had never been before, thus
detained by freshets and rocks when on its way to
them. Methinks that must be where all my property
lies, cast up on the rocks on some distant and unexplored
stream, and waiting for an unheard-of freshet
to fetch it down. O make haste, ye gods, with your
winds and rains, and start the jam before it rots!

The last half mile carried us to the Sowadnehunk
Deadwater, so called from the stream of the same name,
signifying "running between mountains," an important
tributary which comes in a mile above. Here we decided
to camp, about twenty miles from the Dam, at the mouth
of Murch Brook and the Aboljacknagesic, mountain
streams, broad off from Ktaadn, and about a dozen miles
from its summit, having made fifteen miles this day.

We had been told by McCauslin that we should here
find trout enough; so, while some prepared the camp,
the rest fell to fishing. Seizing the birch poles which
some party of Indians, or white hunters, had left on
the shore, and baiting our hooks with pork, and with
59
trout, as soon as they were caught, we cast our lines
into the mouth of the Aboljacknagesic, a clear, swift,
shallow stream, which came in from Ktaadn. Instantly
a shoal of white chivin (Leuciscus pulchellus),
silvery roaches, cousin-trout, or what not, large and
small, prowling thereabouts, fell upon our bait, and one
after another were landed amidst the bushes. Anon
their cousins, the true trout, took their turn, and alternately
the speckled trout, and the silvery roaches,
swallowed the bait as fast as we could throw in; and
the finest specimens of both that I have ever seen, the
largest one weighing three pounds, were heaved upon
the shore, though at first in vain, to wriggle down into
the water again, for we stood in the boat; but soon we
learned to remedy this evil; for one, who had lost his
hook, stood on shore to catch them as they fell in a
perfect shower around him,&mdash;sometimes, wet and slippery,
full in his face and bosom, as his arms were outstretched
to receive them. While yet alive, before their
tints had faded, they glistened like the fairest flowers,
the product of primitive rivers; and he could hardly
trust his senses, as he stood over them, that these jewels
should have swam away in that Aboljacknagesic water
for so long, so many dark ages;&mdash;these bright fluviatile
flowers, seen of Indians only, made beautiful, the Lord
only knows why, to swim there! I could understand
better for this, the truth of mythology, the fables of
Proteus, and all those beautiful sea-monsters,&mdash;how
all history, indeed, put to a terrestrial use, is mere history;
but put to a celestial, is mythology always.

But there is the rough voice of Uncle George, who
60
commands at the frying-pan, to send over what you've
got, and then you may stay till morning. The pork
sizzles and cries for fish. Luckily for the foolish race,
and this particularly foolish generation of trout, the
night shut down at last, not a little deepened by the
dark side of Ktaadn, which, like a permanent shadow,
reared itself from the eastern bank. Lescarbot, writing
in 1609, tells us that the Sieur Champdoré, who,
with one of the people of the Sieur de Monts, ascended
some fifty leagues up the St. John in 1608, found the
fish so plenty, "qu'en mettant la chaudière sur le feu
ils en avoient pris suffisamment pour eux disner avant
que l'eau fust chaude." Their descendants here are
no less numerous. So we accompanied Tom into the
woods to cut cedar twigs for our bed. While he went
ahead with the axe and lopped off the smallest twigs of
the flat-leaved cedar, the arbor-vitæ of the gardens, we
gathered them up, and returned with them to the boat,
until it was loaded. Our bed was made with as much
care and skill as a roof is shingled; beginning at the
foot, and laying the twig end of the cedar upward, we
advanced to the head, a course at a time, thus successively
covering the stub-ends, and producing a soft and
level bed. For us six it was about ten feet long by six
in breadth. This time we lay under our tent, having
pitched it more prudently with reference to the wind
and the flame, and the usual huge fire blazed in front.
Supper was eaten off a large log, which some freshet
had thrown up. This night we had a dish of arbor-vitæ
or cedar tea, which the lumberer sometimes uses
when other herbs fail,&mdash;
61



"A quart of arbor-vitæ,
To make him strong and mighty,"&mdash;


but I had no wish to repeat the experiment. It had
too medicinal a taste for my palate. There was the
skeleton of a moose here, whose bones some Indian
hunters had picked on this very spot.

In the night I dreamed of trout-fishing; and, when
at length I awoke, it seemed a fable that this painted
fish swam there so near my couch, and rose to our
hooks the last evening, and I doubted if I had not
dreamed it all. So I arose before dawn to test its truth,
while my companions were still sleeping. There stood
Ktaadn with distinct and cloudless outline in the
moonlight; and the rippling of the rapids was the only
sound to break the stillness. Standing on the shore, I
once more cast my line into the stream, and found the
dream to be real and the fable true. The speckled trout
and silvery roach, like flying-fish, sped swiftly through
the moonlight air, describing bright arcs on the dark
side of Ktaadn, until moonlight, now fading into daylight,
brought satiety to my mind, and the minds of my
companions, who had joined me.

By six o'clock, having mounted our packs and a good
blanketful of trout, ready dressed, and swung up such
baggage and provision as we wished to leave behind
upon the tops of saplings, to be out of the reach of
bears, we started for the summit of the mountain, distant,
as Uncle George said the boatmen called it, about
four miles, but as I judged, and as it proved, nearer
fourteen. He had never been any nearer the mountain
than this, and there was not the slightest trace of man
62
to guide us farther in this direction. At first, pushing
a few rods up the Aboljacknagesic, or "open-land
stream," we fastened our batteau to a tree, and traveled
up the north side, through burnt lands, now partially
overgrown with young aspens and other shrubbery;
but soon, recrossing this stream, where it was about
fifty or sixty feet wide, upon a jam of logs and rocks,&mdash;and
you could cross it by this means almost anywhere,&mdash;we
struck at once for the highest peak, over
a mile or more of comparatively open land, still very
gradually ascending the while. Here it fell to my lot,
as the oldest mountain-climber, to take the lead. So,
scanning the woody side of the mountain, which lay
still at an indefinite distance, stretched out some seven
or eight miles in length before us, we determined to
steer directly for the base of the highest peak, leaving a
large slide, by which, as I have since learned, some of our
predecessors ascended, on our left. This course would
lead us parallel to a dark seam in the forest, which
marked the bed of a torrent, and over a slight spur,
which extended southward from the main mountain,
from whose bare summit we could get an outlook over
the country, and climb directly up the peak, which
would then be close at hand. Seen from this point, a
bare ridge at the extremity of the open land, Ktaadn
presented a different aspect from any mountain I have
seen, there being a greater proportion of naked rock
rising abruptly from the forest; and we looked up at
this blue barrier as if it were some fragment of a wall
which anciently bounded the earth in that direction.
Setting the compass for a northeast course, which was
63
the bearing of the southern base of the highest peak,
we were soon buried in the woods.

We soon began to meet with traces of bears and
moose, and those of rabbits were everywhere visible.
The tracks of moose, more or less recent, to speak literally,
covered every square rod on the sides of the
mountain; and these animals are probably more numerous
there now than ever before, being driven into this
wilderness, from all sides, by the settlements. The track
of a full-grown moose is like that of a cow, or larger,
and of the young, like that of a calf. Sometimes we
found ourselves traveling in faint paths, which they had
made, like cow-paths in the woods, only far more indistinct,
being rather openings, affording imperfect vistas
through the dense underwood, than trodden paths;
and everywhere the twigs had been browsed by them,
clipped as smoothly as if by a knife. The bark of trees
was stripped up by them to the height of eight or nine
feet, in long, narrow strips, an inch wide, still showing
the distinct marks of their teeth. We expected nothing
less than to meet a herd of them every moment, and
our Nimrod held his shooting-iron in readiness; but
we did not go out of our way to look for them, and,
though numerous, they are so wary that the unskillful
hunter might range the forest a long time before he
could get sight of one. They are sometimes dangerous
to encounter, and will not turn out for the hunter, but
furiously rush upon him and trample him to death, unless
he is lucky enough to avoid them by dodging round
a tree. The largest are nearly as large as a horse, and
weigh sometimes one thousand pounds; and it is said
64
that they can step over a five-foot gate in their ordinary
walk. They are described as exceedingly awkward-looking
animals, with their long legs and short bodies,
making a ludicrous figure when in full run, but making
great headway, nevertheless. It seemed a mystery to us
how they could thread these woods, which it required
all our suppleness to accomplish,&mdash;climbing, stooping,
and winding, alternately. They are said to drop their
long and branching horns, which usually spread five
or six feet, on their backs, and make their way easily
by the weight of their bodies. Our boatmen said, but
I know not with how much truth, that their horns are
apt to be gnawed away by vermin while they sleep.
Their flesh, which is more like beef than venison, is
common in Bangor market.

We had proceeded on thus seven or eight miles, till
about noon, with frequent pauses to refresh the weary
ones, crossing a considerable mountain stream, which
we conjectured to be Murch Brook, at whose mouth we
had camped, all the time in woods, without having once
seen the summit, and rising very gradually, when the
boatmen beginning to despair a little, and fearing that
we were leaving the mountain on one side of us, for
they had not entire faith in the compass, McCauslin
climbed a tree, from the top of which he could see the
peak, when it appeared that we had not swerved from
a right line, the compass down below still ranging with
his arm, which pointed to the summit. By the side of
a cool mountain rill, amid the woods, where the water
began to partake of the purity and transparency of the
air, we stopped to cook some of our fishes, which we had
65
brought thus far in order to save our hard-bread and
pork, in the use of which we had put ourselves on short
allowance. We soon had a fire blazing, and stood around
it, under the damp and sombre forest of firs and birches,
each with a sharpened stick, three or four feet in length,
upon which he had spitted his trout, or roach, previously
well gashed and salted, our sticks radiating like
the spokes of a wheel from one centre, and each crowding
his particular fish into the most desirable exposure,
not with the truest regard always to his neighbor's
rights. Thus we regaled ourselves, drinking meanwhile
at the spring, till one man's pack, at least, was considerably
lightened, when we again took up our line of
march.

At length we reached an elevation sufficiently bare
to afford a view of the summit, still distant and blue,
almost as if retreating from us. A torrent, which proved
to be the same we had crossed, was seen tumbling
down in front, literally from out of the clouds. But this
glimpse at our whereabouts was soon lost, and we were
buried in the woods again. The wood was chiefly yellow
birch, spruce, fir, mountain-ash, or round-wood,
as the Maine people call it, and moose-wood. It was
the worst kind of traveling; sometimes like the densest
scrub oak patches with us. The cornel, or bunch-berries,
were very abundant, as well as Solomon's-seal and
moose-berries. Blueberries were distributed along our
whole route; and in one place the bushes were drooping
with the weight of the fruit, still as fresh as ever.
It was the 7th of September. Such patches afforded a
grateful repast, and served to bait the tired party forward.
66
When any lagged behind, the cry of "blueberries"
was most effectual to bring them up. Even at
this elevation we passed through a moose-yard, formed
by a large flat rock, four or five rods square, where
they tread down the snow in winter. At length, fearing
that if we held the direct course to the summit, we
should not find any water near our camping-ground,
we gradually swerved to the west, till, at four o'clock,
we struck again the torrent which I have mentioned,
and here, in view of the summit, the weary party decided
to camp that night.

While my companions were seeking a suitable spot
for this purpose, I improved the little daylight that was
left in climbing the mountain alone. We were in a
deep and narrow ravine, sloping up to the clouds, at
an angle of nearly forty-five degrees, and hemmed in
by walls of rock, which were at first covered with low
trees, then with impenetrable thickets of scraggy birches
and spruce trees, and with moss, but at last bare of all
vegetation but lichens, and almost continually draped
in clouds. Following up the course of the torrent which
occupied this,&mdash;and I mean to lay some emphasis on
this word up,&mdash;pulling myself up by the side of perpendicular
falls of twenty or thirty feet, by the roots of
firs and birches, and then, perhaps, walking a level rod
or two in the thin stream, for it took up the whole
road, ascending by huge steps, as it were, a giant's
stairway, down which a river flowed, I had soon cleared
the trees, and paused on the successive shelves, to look
back over the country. The torrent was from fifteen
to thirty feet wide, without a tributary, and seemingly
67
not diminishing in breadth as I advanced; but still it
came rushing and roaring down, with a copious tide,
over and amidst masses of bare rock, from the very
clouds, as though a waterspout had just burst over
the mountain. Leaving this at last, I began to work
my way, scarcely less arduous than Satan's anciently
through Chaos, up the nearest though not the highest
peak. At first scrambling on all fours over the tops of
ancient black spruce trees (Abies nigra), old as the flood,
from two to ten or twelve feet in height, their tops flat
and spreading, and their foliage blue, and nipped with
cold, as if for centuries they had ceased growing upward
against the bleak sky, the solid cold. I walked
some good rods erect upon the tops of these trees, which
were overgrown with moss and mountain cranberries.
It seemed that in the course of time they had filled
up the intervals between the huge rocks, and the cold
wind had uniformly leveled all over. Here the principle
of vegetation was hard put to it. There was apparently
a belt of this kind running quite round the
mountain, though, perhaps, nowhere so remarkable as
here. Once, slumping through, I looked down ten feet,
into a dark and cavernous region, and saw the stem of
a spruce, on whose top I stood, as on a mass of coarse
basket-work, fully nine inches in diameter at the ground.
These holes were bears' dens, and the bears were even
then at home. This was the sort of garden I made my
way over, for an eighth of a mile, at the risk, it is true,
of treading on some of the plants, not seeing any path
through it,&mdash;certainly the most treacherous and porous
country I ever traveled.
68



"Nigh foundered on he fares,
Treading the crude consistence, half on foot,
Half flying,"


But nothing could exceed the toughness of the twigs,&mdash;not
one snapped under my weight, for they had
slowly grown. Having slumped, scrambled, rolled,
bounced, and walked, by turns, over this scraggy country,
I arrived upon a side-hill, or rather side-mountain,
where rocks, gray, silent rocks, were the flocks and
herds that pastured, chewing a rocky cud at sunset.
They looked at me with hard gray eyes, without a bleat
or a low. This brought me to the skirt of a cloud, and
bounded my walk that night. But I had already seen
that Maine country when I turned about, waving, flowing,
rippling, down below.

When I returned to my companions, they had selected
a camping-ground on the torrent's edge, and
were resting on the ground; one was on the sick list,
rolled in a blanket, on a damp shelf of rock. It was
a savage and dreary scenery enough, so wildly rough,
that they looked long to find a level and open space
for the tent. We could not well camp higher, for want
of fuel; and the trees here seemed so evergreen and
sappy, that we almost doubted if they would acknowledge
the influence of fire; but fire prevailed at last, and
blazed here, too, like a good citizen of the world. Even
at this height we met with frequent traces of moose,
as well as of bears. As here was no cedar, we made
our bed of coarser feathered spruce; but at any rate
the feathers were plucked from the live tree. It was,
perhaps, even a more grand and desolate place for a
69
night's lodging than the summit would have been, being
in the neighborhood of those wild trees, and of the
torrent. Some more aërial and finer-spirited winds
rushed and roared through the ravine all night, from
time to time arousing our fire, and dispersing the embers
about. It was as if we lay in the very nest of a
young whirlwind. At midnight, one of my bed-fellows,
being startled in his dreams by the sudden blazing
up to its top of a fir tree, whose green boughs were
dried by the heat, sprang up, with a cry, from his bed,
thinking the world on fire, and drew the whole camp
after him.

In the morning, after whetting our appetite on some
raw pork, a wafer of hard-bread, and a dipper of condensed
cloud or waterspout, we all together began to
make our way up the falls, which I have described;
this time choosing the right hand, or highest peak,
which was not the one I had approached before. But
soon my companions were lost to my sight behind the
mountain ridge in my rear, which still seemed ever retreating
before me, and I climbed alone over huge rocks,
loosely poised, a mile or more, still edging toward the
clouds; for though the day was clear elsewhere, the
summit was concealed by mist. The mountain seemed
a vast aggregation of loose rocks, as if some time it had
rained rocks, and they lay as they fell on the mountain
sides, nowhere fairly at rest, but leaning on each
other, all rocking stones, with cavities between, but
scarcely any soil or smoother shelf. They were the raw
materials of a planet dropped from an unseen quarry,
which the vast chemistry of nature would anon work
70
up, or work down, into the smiling and verdant plains
and valleys of earth. This was an undone extremity
of the globe; as in lignite we see coal in the process of
formation.

At length I entered within the skirts of the cloud
which seemed forever drifting over the summit, and yet
would never be gone, but was generated out of that
pure air as fast as it flowed away; and when, a quarter
of a mile farther, I reached the summit of the ridge,
which those who have seen in clearer weather say is
about five miles long, and contains a thousand acres of
table-land, I was deep within the hostile ranks of clouds,
and all objects were obscured by them. Now the wind
would blow me out a yard of clear sunlight, wherein I
stood; then a gray, dawning light was all it could accomplish,
the cloud-line ever rising and falling with the
wind's intensity. Sometimes it seemed as if the summit
would be cleared in a few moments, and smile in
sunshine; but what was gained on one side was lost on
another. It was like sitting in a chimney and waiting
for the smoke to blow away. It was, in fact, a cloud-factory,&mdash;these
were the cloud-works, and the wind
turned them off done from the cool, bare rocks. Occasionally,
when the windy columns broke in to me, I
caught sight of a dark, damp crag to the right or left;
the mist driving ceaselessly between it and me. It
reminded me of the creations of the old epic and dramatic
poets, of Atlas, Vulcan, the Cyclops, and Prometheus.
Such was Caucasus and the rock where Prometheus
was bound. Æschylus had no doubt visited such
scenery as this. It was vast, Titanic, and such as man
71
never inhabits. Some part of the beholder, even some
vital part, seems to escape through the loose grating of
his ribs as he ascends. He is more lone than you can
imagine. There is less of substantial thought and fair
understanding in him than in the plains where men inhabit.
His reason is dispersed and shadowy, more thin
and subtile, like the air. Vast, Titanic, inhuman Nature
has got him at disadvantage, caught him alone,
and pilfers him of some of his divine faculty. She does
not smile on him as in the plains. She seems to say
sternly, Why came ye here before your time. This
ground is not prepared for you. Is it not enough that
I smile in the valleys? I have never made this soil for
thy feet, this air for thy breathing, these rocks for thy
neighbors. I cannot pity nor fondle thee here, but forever
relentlessly drive thee hence to where I am kind.
Why seek me where I have not called thee, and then
complain because you find me but a stepmother?
Shouldst thou freeze or starve, or shudder thy life away,
here is no shrine, nor altar, nor any access to my ear.



"Chaos and ancient Night, I come no spy
With purpose to explore or to disturb
The secrets of your realm, but ...
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as my way
Lies through your spacious empire up to light."


The tops of mountains are among the unfinished
parts of the globe, whither it is a slight insult to the
gods to climb and pry into their secrets, and try their
effect on our humanity. Only daring and insolent men,
perchance, go there. Simple races, as savages, do not
climb mountains,&mdash;their tops are sacred and mysterious
72
tracts never visited by them. Pomola is always
angry with those who climb to the summit of Ktaadn.

According to Jackson, who, in his capacity of geological
surveyor of the State, has accurately measured
it, the altitude of Ktaadn is 5300 feet, or a little more
than one mile above the level of the sea, and he adds,
"It is then evidently the highest point in the State of
Maine, and is the most abrupt granite mountain in New
England." The peculiarities of that spacious table-land
on which I was standing, as well as the remarkable
semicircular precipice or basin on the eastern side, were
all concealed by the mist. I had brought my whole
pack to the top, not knowing but I should have to
make my descent to the river, and possibly to the settled
portion of the State alone, and by some other route, and
wishing to have a complete outfit with me. But at length
fearing that my companions would be anxious to reach
the river before night, and knowing that the clouds
might rest on the mountain for days, I was compelled
to descend. Occasionally, as I came down, the wind
would blow me a vista open, through which I could see
the country eastward, boundless forests, and lakes, and
streams, gleaming in the sun, some of them emptying
into the East Branch. There were also new mountains
in sight in that direction. Now and then some small
bird of the sparrow family would flit away before me,
unable to command its course, like a fragment of the
gray rock blown off by the wind.

I found my companions where I had left them, on
the side of the peak, gathering the mountain cranberries,
which filled every crevice between the rocks, together
73
with blueberries, which had a spicier flavor the higher
up they grew, but were not the less agreeable to our
palates. When the country is settled, and roads are
made, these cranberries will perhaps become an article of
commerce. From this elevation, just on the skirts of the
clouds, we could overlook the country, west and south,
for a hundred miles. There it was, the State of Maine,
which we had seen on the map, but not much like that,&mdash;immeasurable
forest for the sun to shine on, that eastern
stuff we hear of in Massachusetts. No clearing, no
house. It did not look as if a solitary traveler had cut
so much as a walking-stick there. Countless lakes,&mdash;Moosehead
in the southwest, forty miles long by ten
wide, like a gleaming silver platter at the end of the
table; Chesuncook, eighteen long by three wide, without
an island; Millinocket, on the south, with its hundred
islands; and a hundred others without a name; and
mountains, also, whose names, for the most part, are
known only to the Indians. The forest looked like a
firm grass sward, and the effect of these lakes in its
midst has been well compared, by one who has since
visited this same spot, to that of a "mirror broken into
a thousand fragments, and wildly scattered over the
grass, reflecting the full blaze of the sun." It was a
large farm for somebody, when cleared. According to
the Gazetteer, which was printed before the boundary
question was settled, this single Penobscot County, in
which we were, was larger than the whole State of
Vermont, with its fourteen counties; and this was only
a part of the wild lands of Maine. We are concerned
now, however, about natural, not political limits. We
74
were about eighty miles, as the bird flies, from Bangor,
or one hundred and fifteen, as we had ridden, and
walked, and paddled. We had to console ourselves
with the reflection that this view was probably as good
as that from the peak, as far as it went; and what were
a mountain without its attendant clouds and mists?
Like ourselves, neither Bailey nor Jackson had obtained
a clear view from the summit.

Setting out on our return to the river, still at an early
hour in the day, we decided to follow the course of
the torrent, which we supposed to be Murch Brook, as
long as it would not lead us too far out of our way.
We thus traveled about four miles in the very torrent
itself, continually crossing and recrossing it, leaping
from rock to rock, and jumping with the stream down
falls of seven or eight feet, or sometimes sliding down
on our backs in a thin sheet of water. This ravine
had been the scene of an extraordinary freshet in the
spring, apparently accompanied by a slide from the
mountain. It must have been filled with a stream of
stones and water, at least twenty feet above the present
level of the torrent. For a rod or two, on either side of
its channel, the trees were barked and splintered up to
their tops, the birches bent over, twisted, and sometimes
finely split, like a stable-broom; some, a foot in diameter,
snapped off, and whole clumps of trees bent
over with the weight of rocks piled on them. In one
place we noticed a rock, two or three feet in diameter,
lodged nearly twenty feet high in the crotch of a tree.
For the whole four miles we saw but one rill emptying
in, and the volume of water did not seem to be increased
75
from the first. We traveled thus very rapidly with a
downward impetus, and grew remarkably expert at leaping
from rock to rock, for leap we must, and leap we did,
whether there was any rock at the right distance or not.
It was a pleasant picture when the foremost turned
about and looked up the winding ravine, walled in with
rocks and the green forest, to see, at intervals of a rod
or two, a red-shirted or green-jacketed mountaineer
against the white torrent, leaping down the channel
with his pack on his back, or pausing upon a convenient
rock in the midst of the torrent to mend a rent in
his clothes, or unstrap the dipper at his belt to take a
draught of the water. At one place we were startled by
seeing, on a little sandy shelf by the side of the stream,
the fresh print of a man's foot, and for a moment realized
how Robinson Crusoe felt in a similar case; but
at last we remembered that we had struck this stream
on our way up, though we could not have told where,
and one had descended into the ravine for a drink.
The cool air above and the continual bathing of our
bodies in mountain water, alternate foot, sitz, douche,
and plunge baths, made this walk exceedingly refreshing,
and we had traveled only a mile or two, after
leaving the torrent, before every thread of our clothes
was as dry as usual, owing perhaps to a peculiar quality
in the atmosphere.

After leaving the torrent, being in doubt about our
course, Tom threw down his pack at the foot of the
loftiest spruce tree at hand, and shinned up the bare
trunk some twenty feet, and then climbed through the
green tower, lost to our sight, until he held the topmost
76
spray in his hand.[5] McCauslin, in his younger days,
had marched through the wilderness with a body of
troops, under General Somebody, and with one other
man did all the scouting and spying service. The
General's word was, "Throw down the top of that
tree," and there was no tree in the Maine woods so
high that it did not lose its top in such a case. I have
heard a story of two men being lost once in these woods,
nearer to the settlements than this, who climbed the
loftiest pine they could find, some six feet in diameter
at the ground, from whose top they discovered a solitary
clearing and its smoke. When at this height, some
two hundred feet from the ground, one of them became
dizzy, and fainted in his companion's arms, and the
latter had to accomplish the descent with him, alternately
fainting and reviving, as best he could. To Tom
we cried, "Where away does the summit bear? where
the burnt lands?" The last he could only conjecture;
he descried, however, a little meadow and pond, lying
probably in our course, which we concluded to steer
for. On reaching this secluded meadow, we found
fresh tracks of moose on the shore of the pond, and the
water was still unsettled as if they had fled before us.
77
A little farther, in a dense thicket, we seemed to be
still on their trail. It was a small meadow, of a few
acres, on the mountain-side, concealed by the forest,
and perhaps never seen by a white man before, where
one would think that the moose might browse and
bathe, and rest in peace. Pursuing this course, we soon
reached the open land, which went sloping down some
miles toward the Penobscot.

Perhaps I most fully realized that this was primeval,
untamed, and forever untamable Nature, or whatever
else men call it, while coming down this part of the
mountain. We were passing over "Burnt Lands,"
burnt by lightning, perchance, though they showed no
recent marks of fire, hardly so much as a charred
stump, but looked rather like a natural pasture for the
moose and deer, exceedingly wild and desolate, with
occasional strips of timber crossing them, and low poplars
springing up, and patches of blueberries here and
there. I found myself traversing them familiarly, like
some pasture run to waste, or partially reclaimed by
man; but when I reflected what man, what brother or
sister or kinsman of our race made it and claimed it,
I expected the proprietor to rise up and dispute my
passage. It is difficult to conceive of a region uninhabited
by man. We habitually presume his presence
and influence everywhere. And yet we have not seen
pure Nature, unless we have seen her thus vast and
drear and inhuman, though in the midst of cities. Nature
was here something savage and awful, though
beautiful. I looked with awe at the ground I trod on,
to see what the Powers had made there, the form and
78
fashion and material of their work. This was that
Earth of which we have heard, made out of Chaos and
Old Night. Here was no man's garden, but the unhandseled
globe. It was not lawn, nor pasture, nor
mead, nor woodland, nor lea, nor arable, nor waste
land. It was the fresh and natural surface of the planet
Earth, as it was made forever and ever,&mdash;to be the
dwelling of man, we say,&mdash;so Nature made it, and
man may use it if he can. Man was not to be associated
with it. It was Matter, vast, terrific,&mdash;not
his Mother Earth that we have heard of, not for him
to tread on, or be buried in,&mdash;no, it were being too
familiar even to let his bones lie there,&mdash;the home,
this, of Necessity and Fate. There was clearly felt the
presence of a force not bound to be kind to man. It
was a place for heathenism and superstitious rites,&mdash;to
be inhabited by men nearer of kin to the rocks and
to wild animals than we. We walked over it with a
certain awe, stopping, from time to time, to pick the
blueberries which grew there, and had a smart and
spicy taste. Perchance where our wild pines stand,
and leaves lie on their forest floor, in Concord, there
were once reapers, and husbandmen planted grain; but
here not even the surface had been scarred by man,
but it was a specimen of what God saw fit to make this
world. What is it to be admitted to a museum, to
see a myriad of particular things, compared with being
shown some star's surface, some hard matter in its
home! I stand in awe of my body, this matter to which
I am bound has become so strange to me. I fear not
spirits, ghosts, of which I am one,&mdash;that my body
79
might,&mdash;but I fear bodies, I tremble to meet them.
What is this Titan that has possession of me? Talk
of mysteries! Think of our life in nature,&mdash;daily to
be shown matter, to come in contact with it,&mdash;rocks,
trees, wind on our cheeks! the solid earth! the actual
world! the common sense! Contact! Contact! Who
are we? where are we?

Erelong we recognized some rocks and other features
in the landscape which we had purposely impressed on
our memories, and, quickening our pace, by two o'clock
we reached the batteau.[6] Here we had expected to
dine on trout, but in this glaring sunlight they were
slow to take the bait, so we were compelled to make
the most of the crumbs of our hard-bread and our
pork, which were both nearly exhausted. Meanwhile
we deliberated whether we should go up the river a mile
farther, to Gibson's clearing, on the Sowadnehunk,
where there was a deserted log hut, in order to get a
half-inch auger, to mend one of our spike-poles with.
There were young spruce trees enough around us, and
we had a spare spike, but nothing to make a hole with.
But as it was uncertain whether we should find any
tools left there, we patched up the broken pole, as well
as we could, for the downward voyage, in which there
would be but little use for it. Moreover, we were unwilling
to lose any time in this expedition, lest the wind
should rise before we reached the larger lakes, and detain
us; for a moderate wind produces quite a sea on
80
these waters, in which a batteau will not live for a
moment; and on one occasion McCauslin had been
delayed a week at the head of the North Twin, which
is only four miles across. We were nearly out of
provisions, and ill prepared in this respect for what
might possibly prove a week's journey round by
the shore, fording innumerable streams, and threading
a trackless forest, should any accident happen to our
boat.

It was with regret that we turned our backs on Chesuncook,
which McCauslin had formerly logged on,
and the Allegash lakes. There were still longer rapids
and portages above; among the last the Ripogenus
Portage, which he described as the most difficult on the
river, and three miles long. The whole length of the
Penobscot is two hundred and seventy-five miles, and
we are still nearly one hundred miles from its source.
Hodge, the Assistant State Geologist, passed up this
river in 1837, and by a portage of only one mile and
three quarters crossed over into the Allegash, and so
went down that into the St. John, and up the Madawaska
to the Grand Portage across to the St. Lawrence.
His is the only account that I know of an expedition
through to Canada in this direction. He thus describes
his first sight of the latter river, which, to compare
small things with great, is like Balboa's first sight of the
Pacific from the mountains of the Isthmus of Darien.
"When we first came in sight of the St. Lawrence," he
says, "from the top of a high hill, the view was most
striking, and much more interesting to me from having
been shut up in the woods for the two previous months.
81
Directly before us lay the broad river, extending across
nine or ten miles, its surface broken by a few islands
and reefs, and two ships riding at anchor near the
shore. Beyond, extended ranges of uncultivated hills,
parallel with the river. The sun was just going down
behind them, and gilding the whole scene with its parting
rays."

About four o'clock, the same afternoon, we commenced
our return voyage, which would require but
little if any poling. In shooting rapids the boatmen
use large and broad paddles, instead of poles, to guide
the boat with. Though we glided so swiftly, and often
smoothly, down, where it had cost us no slight effort
to get up, our present voyage was attended with far
more danger; for if we once fairly struck one of the
thousand rocks by which we were surrounded, the boat
would be swamped in an instant. When a boat is
swamped under these circumstances, the boatmen commonly
find no difficulty in keeping afloat at first, for
the current keeps both them and their cargo up for a
long way down the stream; and if they can swim, they
have only to work their way gradually to the shore.
The greatest danger is of being caught in an eddy behind
some larger rock, where the water rushes up stream
faster than elsewhere it does down, and being carried
round and round under the surface till they are drowned.
McCauslin pointed out some rocks which had been the
scene of a fatal accident of this kind. Sometimes the
body is not thrown out for several hours. He himself
had performed such a circuit once, only his legs being
visible to his companions; but he was fortunately
82
thrown out in season to recover his breath.[7] In shooting
the rapids, the boatman has this problem to solve:
to choose a circuitous and safe course amid a thousand
sunken rocks, scattered over a quarter or half a mile,
at the same time that he is moving steadily on at the
rate of fifteen miles an hour. Stop he cannot; the only
question is, where will he go? The bowman chooses
the course with all his eyes about him, striking broad
off with his paddle, and drawing the boat by main
force into her course. The sternman faithfully follows
the bow.

We were soon at the Aboljacarmegus Falls. Anxious
to avoid the delay, as well as the labor, of the portage
here, our boatmen went forward first to reconnoitre,
and concluded to let the batteau down the falls, carrying
the baggage only over the portage. Jumping from
rock to rock until nearly in the middle of the stream,
we were ready to receive the boat and let her down over
the first fall, some six or seven feet perpendicular. The
boatmen stand upon the edge of a shelf of rock, where
the fall is perhaps nine or ten feet perpendicular, in
from one to two feet of rapid water, one on each side
of the boat, and let it slide gently over, till the bow is
run out ten or twelve feet in the air; then, letting it
drop squarely, while one holds the painter, the other
leaps in, and his companion following, they are whirled
83
down the rapids to a new fall or to smooth water. In
a very few minutes they had accomplished a passage in
safety, which would be as foolhardy for the unskillful
to attempt as the descent of Niagara itself. It seemed
as if it needed only a little familiarity, and a little more
skill, to navigate down such falls as Niagara itself with
safety. At any rate, I should not despair of such men
in the rapids above Table Rock, until I saw them actually
go over the falls, so cool, so collected, so fertile
in resources are they. One might have thought that
these were falls, and that falls were not to be waded
through with impunity, like a mud-puddle. There was
really danger of their losing their sublimity in losing
their power to harm us. Familiarity breeds contempt.
The boatman pauses, perchance, on some shelf beneath
a table-rock under the fall, standing in some cove of
backwater two feet deep, and you hear his rough voice
come up through the spray, coolly giving directions how
to launch the boat this time.

Having carried round Pockwockomus Falls, our oars
soon brought us to the Katepskonegan, or Oak Hall
carry, where we decided to camp half-way over, leaving
our batteau to be carried over in the morning on fresh
shoulders. One shoulder of each of the boatmen showed
a red spot as large as one's hand, worn by the batteau
on this expedition; and this shoulder, as it did all the
work, was perceptibly lower than its fellow, from long
service. Such toil soon wears out the strongest constitution.
The drivers are accustomed to work in the cold
water in the spring, rarely ever dry; and if one falls in all
over he rarely changes his clothes till night, if then, even.
84
One who takes this precaution is called by a particular
nickname, or is turned off. None can lead this life who
are not almost amphibious. McCauslin said soberly,
what is at any rate a good story to tell, that he had seen
where six men were wholly under water at once, at a
jam, with their shoulders to handspikes. If the log did
not start, then they had to put out their heads to breathe.
The driver works as long as he can see, from dark to
dark, and at night has not time to eat his supper and
dry his clothes fairly, before he is asleep on his cedar
bed. We lay that night on the very bed made by such
a party, stretching our tent over the poles which were
still standing, but re-shingling the damp and faded bed
with fresh leaves.

In the morning we carried our boat over and launched
it, making haste lest the wind should rise. The boatmen
ran down Passamagamet, and soon after Ambejijis
Falls, while we walked round with the baggage. We
made a hasty breakfast at the head of Ambejijis Lake
on the remainder of our pork, and were soon rowing
across its smooth surface again, under a pleasant sky,
the mountain being now clear of clouds in the northeast.
Taking turns at the oars, we shot rapidly across
Deep Cove, the foot of Pamadumcook, and the North
Twin, at the rate of six miles an hour, the wind not being
high enough to disturb us, and reached the Dam at noon.
The boatmen went through one of the log sluices in the
batteau, where the fall was ten feet at the bottom, and
took us in below. Here was the longest rapid in our
voyage, and perhaps the running this was as dangerous
and arduous a task as any. Shooting down sometimes
85
at the rate, as we judged, of fifteen miles an hour, if
we struck a rock we were split from end to end in an
instant. Now like a bait bobbing for some river monster,
amid the eddies, now darting to this side of the
stream, now to that, gliding swift and smooth near to
our destruction, or striking broad off with the paddle
and drawing the boat to right or left with all our might,
in order to avoid a rock. I suppose that it was like
running the rapids of the Sault Sainte Marie, at the
outlet of Lake Superior, and our boatmen probably
displayed no less dexterity than the Indians there do.
We soon ran through this mile, and floated in Quakish
Lake.

After such a voyage, the troubled and angry waters,
which once had seemed terrible and not to be trifled
with, appeared tamed and subdued; they had been
bearded and worried in their channels, pricked and
whipped into submission with the spike-pole and paddle,
gone through and through with impunity, and all
their spirit and their danger taken out of them, and the
most swollen and impetuous rivers seemed but playthings
henceforth. I began, at length, to understand the boatman's
familiarity with, and contempt for, the rapids.
"Those Fowler boys," said Mrs. McCauslin, "are perfect
ducks for the water." They had run down to
Lincoln, according to her, thirty or forty miles, in a
batteau, in the night, for a doctor, when it was so dark
that they could not see a rod before them, and the river
was swollen so as to be almost a continuous rapid, so
that the doctor cried, when they brought him up by daylight,
"Why, Tom, how did you see to steer?" "We
86
didn't steer much,&mdash;only kept her straight." And yet
they met with no accident. It is true, the more difficult
rapids are higher up than this.

When we reached the Millinocket opposite to Tom's
house, and were waiting for his folks to set us over,&mdash;for
we had left our batteau above the Grand Falls,&mdash;we
discovered two canoes, with two men in each, turning
up this stream from Shad Pond, one keeping the
opposite side of a small island before us, while the other
approached the side where we were standing, examining
the banks carefully for muskrats as they came along.
The last proved to be Louis Neptune and his companion,
now, at last, on their way up to Chesuncook after
moose, but they were so disguised that we hardly knew
them. At a little distance they might have been taken
for Quakers, with their broad-brimmed hats and overcoats
with broad capes, the spoils of Bangor, seeking a
settlement in this Sylvania,&mdash;or, nearer at hand, for
fashionable gentlemen the morning after a spree. Met
face to face, these Indians in their native woods looked
like the sinister and slouching fellows whom you meet
picking up strings and paper in the streets of a city.
There is, in fact, a remarkable and unexpected resemblance
between the degraded savage and the lowest
classes in a great city. The one is no more a child of
nature than the other. In the progress of degradation
the distinction of races is soon lost. Neptune at first
was only anxious to know what we "kill," seeing some
partridges in the hands of one of the party, but we
had assumed too much anger to permit of a reply. We
thought Indians had some honor before. But&mdash;"Me
87
been sick. Oh, me unwell now. You make bargain,
then me go." They had in fact been delayed so long by
a drunken frolic at the Five Islands, and they had not
yet recovered from its effects. They had some young
musquash in their canoes, which they dug out of the
banks with a hoe, for food, not for their skins, for
musquash are their principal food on these expeditions.
So they went on up the Millinocket, and we kept down
the bank of the Penobscot, after recruiting ourselves
with a draught of Tom's beer, leaving Tom at his
home.

Thus a man shall lead his life away here on the edge
of the wilderness, on Indian Millinocket Stream, in a
new world, far in the dark of a continent, and have a
flute to play at evening here, while his strains echo to
the stars, amid the howling of wolves; shall live, as it
were, in the primitive age of the world, a primitive man.
Yet he shall spend a sunny day, and in this century be
my contemporary; perchance shall read some scattered
leaves of literature, and sometimes talk with me. Why
read history, then, if the ages and the generations are
now? He lives three thousand years deep into time, an
age not yet described by poets. Can you well go further
back in history than this? Ay! ay!&mdash;for there turns up
but now into the mouth of Millinocket Stream a still
more ancient and primitive man, whose history is not
brought down even to the former. In a bark vessel
sewn with the roots of the spruce, with horn-beam paddles,
he dips his way along. He is but dim and misty
to me, obscured by the æons that lie between the bark
canoe and the batteau. He builds no house of logs, but
88
a wigwam of skins. He eats no hot bread and sweet
cake, but musquash and moose meat and the fat of
bears. He glides up the Millinocket and is lost to my
sight, as a more distant and misty cloud is seen flitting
by behind a nearer, and is lost in space. So he goes
about his destiny, the red face of man.

After having passed the night, and buttered our boots
for the last time, at Uncle George's, whose dogs almost
devoured him for joy at his return, we kept on down
the river the next day, about eight miles on foot, and
then took a batteau, with a man to pole it, to Mattawamkeag,
ten more. At the middle of that very night,
to make a swift conclusion to a long story, we dropped
our buggy over the half-finished bridge at Oldtown,
where we heard the confused din and clink of a hundred
saws, which never rest, and at six o'clock the next
morning one of the party was steaming his way to
Massachusetts.

What is most striking in the Maine wilderness is the
continuousness of the forest, with fewer open intervals
or glades than you had imagined. Except the few
burnt lands, the narrow intervals on the rivers, the
bare tops of the high mountains, and the lakes and
streams, the forest is uninterrupted. It is even more
grim and wild than you had anticipated, a damp and
intricate wilderness, in the spring everywhere wet and
miry. The aspect of the country, indeed, is universally
stern and savage, excepting the distant views of the
forest from hills, and the lake prospects, which are
mild and civilizing in a degree. The lakes are something
89
which you are unprepared for; they lie up so
high, exposed to the light, and the forest is diminished
to a fine fringe on their edges, with here and there a
blue mountain, like amethyst jewels set around some
jewel of the first water,&mdash;so anterior, so superior, to
all the changes that are to take place on their shores,
even now civil and refined, and fair as they can ever
be. These are not the artificial forests of an English
king,&mdash;a royal preserve merely. Here prevail no forest
laws but those of nature. The aborigines have never
been dispossessed, nor nature disforested.



Maine Wilderness


It is a country full of evergreen trees, of mossy silver
birches and watery maples, the ground dotted with
insipid small, red berries, and strewn with damp and
moss-grown rocks,&mdash;a country diversified with innumerable
lakes and rapid streams, peopled with trout
and various species of leucisci, with salmon, shad, and
pickerel, and other fishes; the forest resounding at rare
intervals with the note of the chickadee, the blue jay,
and the woodpecker, the scream of the fish hawk and
the eagle, the laugh of the loon, and the whistle of
ducks along the solitary streams; at night, with the
hooting of owls and howling of wolves; in summer,
swarming with myriads of black flies and mosquitoes,
more formidable than wolves to the white man. Such
is the home of the moose, the bear, the caribou, the
wolf, the beaver, and the Indian. Who shall describe
the inexpressible tenderness and immortal life of the
grim forest, where Nature, though it be midwinter, is
ever in her spring, where the moss-grown and decaying
trees are not old, but seem to enjoy a perpetual youth;
90
and blissful, innocent Nature, like a serene infant, is
too happy to make a noise, except by a few tinkling,
lisping birds and trickling rills?

What a place to live, what a place to die and be
buried in! There certainly men would live forever, and
laugh at death and the grave. There they could have
no such thoughts as are associated with the village
graveyard,&mdash;that make a grave out of one of those
moist evergreen hummocks!



Die and be buried who will,
I mean to live here still;
My nature grows ever more young
The primitive pines among.


I am reminded by my journey how exceedingly new
this country still is. You have only to travel for a few
days into the interior and back parts even of many of
the old States, to come to that very America which the
Northmen, and Cabot, and Gosnold, and Smith, and
Raleigh visited. If Columbus was the first to discover
the islands, Americus Vespucius and Cabot, and the
Puritans, and we their descendants, have discovered
only the shores of America. While the Republic has
already acquired a history world-wide, America is still
unsettled and unexplored. Like the English in New
Holland, we live only on the shores of a continent even
yet, and hardly know where the rivers come from
which float our navy. The very timber and boards
and shingles of which our houses are made grew but
yesterday in a wilderness where the Indian still hunts
and the moose runs wild. New York has her wilderness
within her own borders; and though the sailors of
91
Europe are familiar with the soundings of her Hudson,
and Fulton long since invented the steamboat on its
waters, an Indian is still necessary to guide her scientific
men to its headwaters in the Adirondack country.

Have we even so much as discovered and settled
the shores? Let a man travel on foot along the coast,
from the Passamaquoddy to the Sabine, or to the Rio
Bravo, or to wherever the end is now, if he is swift
enough to overtake it, faithfully following the windings
of every inlet and of every cape, and stepping to the
music of the surf,&mdash;with a desolate fishing town once
a week, and a city's port once a month to cheer him,
and putting up at the lighthouses, when there are any,&mdash;and
tell me if it looks like a discovered and settled
country, and not rather, for the most part, like a desolate
island, and No-Man's Land.

We have advanced by leaps to the Pacific, and left
many a lesser Oregon and California unexplored behind
us. Though the railroad and the telegraph have been
established on the shores of Maine, the Indian still looks
out from her interior mountains over all these to the
sea. There stands the city of Bangor, fifty miles up
the Penobscot, at the head of navigation for vessels of
the largest class, the principal lumber depot on this continent,
with a population of twelve thousand, like a star
on the edge of night, still hewing at the forests of which
it is built, already overflowing with the luxuries and
refinement of Europe, and sending its vessels to Spain,
to England, and to the West Indies for its groceries,&mdash;and
yet only a few axemen have gone "up river," into
the howling wilderness which feeds it. The bear and
92
deer are still found within its limits; and the moose, as
he swims the Penobscot, is entangled amid its shipping,
and taken by foreign sailors in its harbor. Twelve miles
in the rear, twelve miles of railroad, are Orono and the
Indian Island, the home of the Penobscot tribe, and
then commence the batteau and the canoe, and the military
road; and sixty miles above, the country is virtually
unmapped and unexplored, and there still waves
the virgin forest of the New World.

CHESUNCOOK

At five P. M., September 13, 1853, I left Boston, in
the steamer, for Bangor, by the outside course. It was
a warm and still night,&mdash;warmer, probably, on the
water than on the land,&mdash;and the sea was as smooth
as a small lake in summer, merely rippled. The passengers
went singing on the deck, as in a parlor, till ten
o'clock. We passed a vessel on her beam-ends on a
rock just outside the islands, and some of us thought
that she was the "rapt ship" which ran



"on her side so low
That she drank water, and her keel ploughed air,"


not considering that there was no wind, and that she
was under bare poles. Now we have left the islands
behind and are off Nahant. We behold those features
which the discoverers saw, apparently unchanged. Now
we see the Cape Ann lights, and now pass near a small
village-like fleet of mackerel fishers at anchor, probably
off Gloucester. They salute us with a shout from their
low decks; but I understand their "Good-evening" to
mean, "Don't run against me, sir." From the wonders
of the deep we go below to yet deeper sleep. And then
the absurdity of being waked up in the night by a man
who wants the job of blacking your boots! It is more
inevitable than seasickness, and may have something to
do with it. It is like the ducking you get on crossing
the line the first time. I trusted that these old customs
were abolished. They might with the same propriety
94
insist on blacking your face. I heard of one man who
complained that somebody had stolen his boots in the
night; and when he found them, he wanted to know
what they had done to them,&mdash;they had spoiled them,&mdash;he
never put that stuff on them; and the bootblack narrowly
escaped paying damages.

Anxious to get out of the whale's belly, I rose early,
and joined some old salts, who were smoking by a dim
light on a sheltered part of the deck. We were just getting
into the river. They knew all about it, of course.
I was proud to find that I had stood the voyage so well,
and was not in the least digested. We brushed up and
watched the first signs of dawn through an open port;
but the day seemed to hang fire. We inquired the time;
none of my companions had a chronometer. At length an
African prince rushed by, observing, "Twelve o'clock,
gentlemen!" and blew out the light. It was moonrise.
So I slunk down into the monster's bowels again.

The first land we make is Monhegan Island, before
dawn, and next St. George's Islands, seeing two or three
lights. Whitehead, with its bare rocks and funereal
bell, is interesting. Next I remember that the Camden
Hills attracted my eyes, and afterward the hills about
Frankfort. We reached Bangor about noon.

When I arrived, my companion that was to be had
gone up river, and engaged an Indian, Joe Aitteon, a
son of the Governor, to go with us to Chesuncook Lake.
Joe had conducted two white men a-moose-hunting in
the same direction the year before. He arrived by cars
at Bangor that evening, with his canoe and a companion,
Sabattis Solomon, who was going to leave Bangor
95
the following Monday with Joe's father, by way of the
Penobscot, and join Joe in moose-hunting at Chesuncook
when we had done with him. They took supper at
my friend's house and lodged in his barn, saying that
they should fare worse than that in the woods. They
only made Watch bark a little, when they came to the
door in the night for water, for he does not like Indians.

The next morning Joe and his canoe were put on
board the stage for Moosehead Lake, sixty and odd
miles distant, an hour before we started in an open
wagon. We carried hard-bread, pork, smoked beef, tea,
sugar, etc., seemingly enough for a regiment; the sight
of which brought together reminded me by what ignoble
means we had maintained our ground hitherto. We
went by the Avenue Road, which is quite straight and
very good, northwestward toward Moosehead Lake,
through more than a dozen flourishing towns, with almost
every one its academy,&mdash;not one of which, however,
is on my General Atlas, published, alas! in 1824;
so much are they before the age, or I behind it! The
earth must have been considerably lighter to the shoulders
of General Atlas then.

It rained all this day and till the middle of the next
forenoon, concealing the landscape almost entirely; but
we had hardly got out of the streets of Bangor before I
began to be exhilarated by the sight of the wild fir and
spruce tops, and those of other primitive evergreens,
peering through the mist in the horizon. It was like
the sight and odor of cake to a schoolboy. He who
rides and keeps the beaten track studies the fences
chiefly. Near Bangor, the fence-posts, on account of
96
the frost's heaving them in the clayey soil, were not
planted in the ground, but were mortised into a transverse
horizontal beam lying on the surface. Afterwards,
the prevailing fences were log ones, with sometimes a
Virginia fence, or else rails slanted over crossed stakes;
and these zigzagged or played leap-frog all the way to
the lake, keeping just ahead of us. After getting out
of the Penobscot valley, the country was unexpectedly
level, or consisted of very even and equal swells, for
twenty or thirty miles, never rising above the general
level, but affording, it is said, a very good prospect in
clear weather, with frequent views of Ktaadn,&mdash;straight
roads and long hills. The houses were far apart, commonly
small and of one story, but framed. There was
very little land under cultivation, yet the forest did not
often border the road. The stumps were frequently as
high as one's head, showing the depth of the snows.
The white hay-caps, drawn over small stacks of beans
or corn in the fields on account of the rain, were a novel
sight to me. We saw large flocks of pigeons, and several
times came within a rod or two of partridges in the
road. My companion said that in one journey out of
Bangor he and his son had shot sixty partridges from
his buggy. The mountain-ash was now very handsome,
as also the wayfarer's-tree or hobble-bush, with its ripe
purple berries mixed with red. The Canada thistle, an
introduced plant, was the prevailing weed all the way
to the lake, the roadside in many places, and fields not
long cleared, being densely filled with it as with a crop,
to the exclusion of everything else. There were also
whole fields full of ferns, now rusty and withering,
97
which in older countries are commonly confined to wet
ground. There were very few flowers, even allowing
for the lateness of the season. It chanced that I saw no
asters in bloom along the road for fifty miles, though
they were so abundant then in Massachusetts,&mdash;except
in one place one or two of the Aster acuminatus,&mdash;and
no golden-rods till within twenty miles of Monson, where
I saw a three-ribbed one. There were many late buttercups,
however, and the two fire-weeds, erechthites and
epilobium, commonly where there had been a burning,
and at last the pearly everlasting. I noticed occasionally
very long troughs which supplied the road with
water, and my companion said that three dollars annually
were granted by the State to one man in each
school-district, who provided and maintained a suitable
water-trough by the roadside, for the use of travelers,&mdash;a
piece of intelligence as refreshing to me as the water
itself. That legislature did not sit in vain. It was an
Oriental act, which made me wish that I was still farther
down East,&mdash;another Maine law, which I hope
we may get in Massachusetts. That State is banishing
bar-rooms from its highways, and conducting the mountain
springs thither.

The country was first decidedly mountainous in Garland,
Sangerville, and onwards, twenty-five or thirty
miles from Bangor. At Sangerville, where we stopped
at mid-afternoon to warm and dry ourselves, the landlord
told us that he had found a wilderness where we
found him. At a fork in the road between Abbot and
Monson, about twenty miles from Moosehead Lake, I
saw a guide-post surmounted by a pair of moose horns,
98
spreading four or five feet, with the word "Monson"
painted on one blade, and the name of some other town
on the other. They are sometimes used for ornamental
hat-trees, together with deer's horns, in front entries;
but, after the experience which I shall relate, I trust
that I shall have a better excuse for killing a moose
than that I may hang my hat on his horns. We reached
Monson, fifty miles from Bangor, and thirteen from
the lake, after dark.

At four o'clock the next morning, in the dark, and
still in the rain, we pursued our journey. Close to the
academy in this town they have erected a sort of gallows
for the pupils to practice on. I thought that they
might as well hang at once all who need to go through
such exercises in so new a country, where there is nothing
to hinder their living an outdoor life. Better
omit Blair, and take the air. The country about the
south end of the lake is quite mountainous, and the
road began to feel the effects of it. There is one hill
which, it is calculated, it takes twenty-five minutes to
ascend. In many places the road was in that condition
called repaired, having just been whittled into the
required semicylindrical form with the shovel and
scraper, with all the softest inequalities in the middle,
like a hog's back with the bristles up, and Jehu was
expected to keep astride of the spine. As you looked
off each side of the bare sphere into the horizon, the
ditches were awful to behold,&mdash;a vast hollowness, like
that between Saturn and his ring. At a tavern hereabouts
the hostler greeted our horse as an old acquaintance,
though he did not remember the driver.
99
He said that he had taken care of that little mare for
a short time, a year or two before, at the Mount Kineo
House, and thought she was not in as good condition
as then. Every man to his trade. I am not acquainted
with a single horse in the world, not even the one that
kicked me.

Already we had thought that we saw Moosehead
Lake from a hilltop, where an extensive fog filled the
distant lowlands, but we were mistaken. It was not
till we were within a mile or two of its south end that
we got our first view of it,&mdash;a suitably wild-looking
sheet of water, sprinkled with small, low islands, which
were covered with shaggy spruce and other wild wood,&mdash;seen
over the infant port of Greenville with mountains
on each side and far in the north, and a steamer's
smoke-pipe rising above a roof. A pair of moose-horns
ornamented a corner of the public house where we
left our horse, and a few rods distant lay the small
steamer Moosehead, Captain King. There was no
village, and no summer road any farther in this direction,
but a winter road, that is, one passable only
when deep snow covers its inequalities, from Greenville
up the east side of the lake to Lily Bay, about
twelve miles.

I was here first introduced to Joe. He had ridden
all the way on the outside of the stage, the day before,
in the rain, giving way to ladies, and was well wetted.
As it still rained, he asked if we were going to "put it
through." He was a good-looking Indian, twenty-four
years old, apparently of unmixed blood, short and stout,
with a broad face and reddish complexion, and eyes,
100
methinks, narrower and more turned up at the outer
corners than ours, answering to the description of his
race. Besides his underclothing, he wore a red flannel
shirt, woolen pants, and a black Kossuth hat, the ordinary
dress of the lumberman, and, to a considerable
extent, of the Penobscot Indian. When, afterward, he
had occasion to take off his shoes and stockings, I was
struck with the smallness of his feet. He had worked
a good deal as a lumberman, and appeared to identify
himself with that class. He was the only one of the
party who possessed an india-rubber jacket. The top
strip or edge of his canoe was worn nearly through by
friction on the stage.

At eight o'clock the steamer, with her bell and whistle,
scaring the moose, summoned us on board. She was a
well-appointed little boat, commanded by a gentlemanly
captain, with patent life-seats and metallic life-boat, and
dinner on board, if you wish. She is chiefly used by
lumberers for the transportation of themselves, their
boats, and supplies, but also by hunters and tourists.
There was another steamer, named Amphitrite, laid
up close by; but, apparently, her name was not more
trite than her hull. There were also two or three large
sailboats in port. These beginnings of commerce on
a lake in the wilderness are very interesting,&mdash;these
larger white birds that come to keep company with
the gulls. There were but few passengers, and not one
female among them: a St. Francis Indian, with his
canoe and moose-hides; two explorers for lumber; three
men who landed at Sandbar Island, and a gentleman
who lives on Deer Island, eleven miles up the lake,
101
and owns also Sugar Island, between which and the
former the steamer runs; these, I think, were all beside
ourselves. In the saloon was some kind of musical
instrument&mdash;cherubim or seraphim&mdash;to soothe the
angry waves; and there, very properly, was tacked up
the map of the public lands of Maine and Massachusetts,
a copy of which I had in my pocket.

The heavy rain confining us to the saloon awhile, I
discoursed with the proprietor of Sugar Island on the
condition of the world in Old Testament times. But
at length, leaving this subject as fresh as we found it,
he told me that he had lived about this lake twenty or
thirty years, and yet had not been to the head of it
for twenty-one years. He faces the other way. The
explorers had a fine new birch on board, larger than
ours, in which they had come up the Piscataquis from
Howland, and they had had several messes of trout
already. They were going to the neighborhood of
Eagle and Chamberlain lakes, or the head-waters of
the St. John, and offered to keep us company as far as
we went. The lake to-day was rougher than I found
the ocean, either going or returning, and Joe remarked
that it would swamp his birch. Off Lily Bay it is a
dozen miles wide, but it is much broken by islands.
The scenery is not merely wild, but varied and interesting;
mountains were seen, farther or nearer, on all
sides but the northwest, their summits now lost in the
clouds; but Mount Kineo is the principal feature of
the lake, and more exclusively belongs to it. After
leaving Greenville, at the foot, which is the nucleus of
a town some eight or ten years old, you see but three
102
or four houses for the whole length of the lake, or
about forty miles, three of them the public houses at
which the steamer is advertised to stop, and the shore is
an unbroken wilderness. The prevailing wood seemed
to be spruce, fir, birch, and rock maple. You could
easily distinguish the hard wood from the soft, or
"black growth," as it is called, at a great distance, the
former being smooth, round-topped, and light green,
with a bowery and cultivated look.

Mount Kineo, at which the boat touched, is a peninsula
with a narrow neck, about midway the lake on the
east side. The celebrated precipice is on the east or land
side of this, and is so high and perpendicular that you
can jump from the top, many hundred feet, into the
water, which makes up behind the point. A man on
board told us that an anchor had been sunk ninety
fathoms at its base before reaching bottom! Probably
it will be discovered ere long that some Indian maiden
jumped off it for love once, for true love never could
have found a path more to its mind. We passed quite
close to the rock here, since it is a very bold shore, and
I observed marks of a rise of four or five feet on it. The
St. Francis Indian expected to take in his boy here, but
he was not at the landing. The father's sharp eyes,
however, detected a canoe with his boy in it far away
under the mountain, though no one else could see it.
"Where is the canoe?" asked the captain, "I don't see
it;" but he held on, nevertheless, and by and by it hove
in sight.

We reached the head of the lake about noon. The
weather had, in the meanwhile, cleared up, though the
103
mountains were still capped with clouds. Seen from
this point, Mount Kineo, and two other allied mountains
ranging with it northeasterly, presented a very
strong family likeness, as if all cast in one mould. The
steamer here approached a long pier projecting from the
northern wilderness, and built of some of its logs, and
whistled, where not a cabin nor a mortal was to be seen.
The shore was quite low, with flat rocks on it, overhung
with black ash, arbor-vitæ, etc., which at first looked
as if they did not care a whistle for us. There was not
a single cabman to cry "Coach!" or inveigle us to the
United States Hotel. At length a Mr. Hinckley, who has
a camp at the other end of the "carry," appeared with
a truck drawn by an ox and a horse over a rude log-railway
through the woods. The next thing was to get
our canoe and effects over the carry from this lake, one
of the heads of the Kennebec, into the Penobscot River.
This railway from the lake to the river occupied the
middle of a clearing two or three rods wide and perfectly
straight through the forest. We walked across
while our baggage was drawn behind. My companion
went ahead to be ready for partridges, while I followed,
looking at the plants.

This was an interesting botanical locality for one
coming from the south to commence with; for many
plants which are rather rare, and one or two which are
not found at all, in the eastern part of Massachusetts,
grew abundantly between the rails,&mdash;as Labrador-tea,
Kalmia glauca, Canada blueberry (which was still in
fruit, and a second time in bloom), Clintonia and Linnæa
borealis, which last a lumberer called moxon, creeping
104
snowberry, painted trillium, large-flowered bellwort,
etc. I fancied that the Aster Radula, Diplopappus umbellatus,
Solidago lanceolata, red trumpet-weed, and many
others which were conspicuously in bloom on the shore
of the lake and on the carry, had a peculiarly wild and
primitive look there. The spruce and fir trees crowded
to the track on each side to welcome us, the arbor-vitæ,
with its changing leaves, prompted us to make haste,
and the sight of the canoe birch gave us spirits to do so.
Sometimes an evergreen just fallen lay across the track
with its rich burden of cones, looking, still, fuller of life
than our trees in the most favorable positions. You did
not expect to find such spruce trees in the wild woods,
but they evidently attend to their toilets each morning
even there. Through such a front yard did we enter that
wilderness.

There was a very slight rise above the lake,&mdash;the
country appearing like, and perhaps being partly a
swamp,&mdash;and at length a gradual descent to the Penobscot,
which I was surprised to find here a large stream,
from twelve to fifteen rods wide, flowing from west to
east, or at right angles with the lake, and not more than
two and a half miles from it. The distance is nearly
twice too great on the Map of the Public Lands, and on
Colton's Map of Maine, and Russell Stream is placed
too far down. Jackson makes Moosehead Lake to be
nine hundred and sixty feet above high water in Portland
harbor. It is higher than Chesuncook, for the
lumberers consider the Penobscot, where we struck it,
twenty-five feet lower than Moosehead, though eight
miles above it is said to be the highest, so that the water
105
can be made to flow either way, and the river falls a
good deal between here and Chesuncook. The carry-man
called this about one hundred and forty miles above
Bangor by the river, or two hundred from the ocean,
and fifty-five miles below Hilton's, on the Canada road,
the first clearing above, which is four and a half miles
from the source of the Penobscot.

At the north end of the carry, in the midst of a
clearing of sixty acres or more, there was a log camp
of the usual construction, with something more like a
house adjoining, for the accommodation of the carry-man's
family and passing lumberers. The bed of withered
fir twigs smelled very sweet, though really very
dirty. There was also a store-house on the bank of the
river, containing pork, flour, iron, batteaux, and birches,
locked up.

We now proceeded to get our dinner, which always
turned out to be tea, and to pitch canoes, for which
purpose a large iron pot lay permanently on the bank.
This we did in company with the explorers. Both Indians
and whites use a mixture of rosin and grease for
this purpose, that is, for the pitching, not the dinner.
Joe took a small brand from the fire and blew the heat
and flame against the pitch on his birch, and so melted
and spread it. Sometimes he put his mouth over the
suspected spot and sucked, to see if it admitted air;
and at one place, where we stopped, he set his canoe
high on crossed stakes, and poured water into it. I narrowly
watched his motions, and listened attentively to
his observations, for we had employed an Indian mainly
that I might have an opportunity to study his ways.
106
I heard him swear once, mildly, during this operation,
about his knife being as dull as a hoe,&mdash;an accomplishment
which he owed to his intercourse with the whites;
and he remarked, "We ought to have some tea before
we start; we shall be hungry before we kill that moose."

At mid-afternoon we embarked on the Penobscot.
Our birch was nineteen and a half feet long by two and
a half at the widest part, and fourteen inches deep
within, both ends alike, and painted green, which Joe
thought affected the pitch and made it leak. This, I
think, was a middling-sized one. That of the explorers
was much larger, though probably not much longer.
This carried us three with our baggage, weighing in all
between five hundred and fifty and six hundred pounds.
We had two heavy, though slender, rock-maple paddles,
one of them of bird's-eye maple. Joe placed birch-bark
on the bottom for us to sit on, and slanted cedar
splints against the cross-bars to protect our backs, while
he himself sat upon a cross-bar in the stern. The baggage
occupied the middle or widest part of the canoe.
We also paddled by turns in the bows, now sitting with
our legs extended, now sitting upon our legs, and now
rising upon our knees; but I found none of these positions
endurable, and was reminded of the complaints
of the old Jesuit missionaries of the torture they endured
from long confinement in constrained positions
in canoes, in their long voyages from Quebec to the
Huron country; but afterwards I sat on the cross-bars,
or stood up, and experienced no inconvenience.

It was deadwater for a couple of miles. The river
had been raised about two feet by the rain, and lumberers
107
were hoping for a flood sufficient to bring down
the logs that were left in the spring. Its banks were
seven or eight feet high, and densely covered with white
and black spruce,&mdash;which, I think, must be the commonest
trees thereabouts,&mdash;fir, arbor-vitæ, canoe,
yellow and black birch, rock, mountain, and a few red
maples, beech, black and mountain ash, the large-toothed
aspen, many civil-looking elms, now imbrowned,
along the stream, and at first a few hemlocks also.
We had not gone far before I was startled by seeing
what I thought was an Indian encampment, covered
with a red flag, on the bank, and exclaimed, "Camp!"
to my comrades. I was slow to discover that it was a
red maple changed by the frost. The immediate shores
were also densely covered with the speckled alder, red
osier, shrubby willows or sallows, and the like. There
were a few yellow lily pads still left, half-drowned,
along the sides, and sometimes a white one. Many
fresh tracks of moose were visible where the water was
shallow, and on the shore, the lily stems were freshly
bitten off by them.

After paddling about two miles, we parted company
with the explorers, and turned up Lobster Stream,
which comes in on the right, from the southeast. This
was six or eight rods wide, and appeared to run nearly
parallel with the Penobscot. Joe said that it was so
called from small fresh-water lobsters found in it. It is
the Matahumkeag of the maps. My companion wished
to look for moose signs, and intended, if it proved
worth the while, to camp up that way, since the Indian
advised it. On account of the rise of the Penobscot,
108
the water ran up this stream to the pond of the same
name, one or two miles. The Spencer Mountains, east
of the north end of Moosehead Lake, were now in plain
sight in front of us. The kingfisher flew before us, the
pigeon woodpecker was seen and heard, and nuthatches
and chickadees close at hand. Joe said that they called
the chickadee kecunnilessu in his language. I will not
vouch for the spelling of what possibly was never spelt
before, but I pronounced after him till he said it would
do. We passed close to a woodcock, which stood perfectly
still on the shore, with feathers puffed up, as if
sick. This Joe said they called nipsquecohossus. The
kingfisher was skuscumonsuck; bear was wassus; Indian
devil, lunxus; the mountain-ash, upahsis. This was
very abundant and beautiful. Moose tracks were not
so fresh along this stream, except in a small creek about
a mile up it, where a large log had lodged in the spring,
marked "W-cross-girdle-crow-foot." We saw a pair of
moose-horns on the shore, and I asked Joe if a moose
had shed them; but he said there was a head attached
to them, and I knew that they did not shed their heads
more than once in their lives.

After ascending about a mile and a half, to within
a short distance of Lobster Lake, we returned to the
Penobscot. Just below the mouth of the Lobster we
found quick water, and the river expanded to twenty
or thirty rods in width. The moose-tracks were quite
numerous and fresh here. We noticed in a great many
places narrow and well-trodden paths by which they
had come down to the river, and where they had slid
on the steep and clayey bank. Their tracks were either
109
close to the edge of the stream, those of the calves distinguishable
from the others, or in shallow water; the
holes made by their feet in the soft bottom being visible
for a long time. They were particularly numerous
where there was a small bay, or pokelogan, as it is
called, bordered by a strip of meadow, or separated
from the river by a low peninsula covered with coarse
grass, wool-grass, etc., wherein they had waded back
and forth and eaten the pads. We detected the remains
of one in such a spot. At one place, where we landed
to pick up a summer duck, which my companion had
shot, Joe peeled a canoe birch for bark for his hunting-horn.
He then asked if we were not going to get the
other duck, for his sharp eyes had seen another fall
in the bushes a little farther along, and my companion
obtained it. I now began to notice the bright red berries
of the tree-cranberry, which grows eight or ten
feet high, mingled with the alders and cornel along the
shore. There was less hard wood than at first.

After proceeding a mile and three quarters below
the mouth of the Lobster, we reached, about sundown,
a small island at the head of what Joe called the
Moosehorn Deadwater (the Moosehorn, in which he
was going to hunt that night, coming in about three
miles below), and on the upper end of this we decided
to camp. On a point at the lower end lay the carcass
of a moose killed a month or more before. We concluded
merely to prepare our camp, and leave our baggage
here, that all might be ready when we returned
from moose-hunting. Though I had not come a-hunting,
and felt some compunctions about accompanying
110
the hunters, I wished to see a moose near at hand, and
was not sorry to learn how the Indian managed to kill
one. I went as reporter or chaplain to the hunters,&mdash;and
the chaplain has been known to carry a gun himself.
After clearing a small space amid the dense spruce
and fir trees, we covered the damp ground with a
shingling of fir twigs, and, while Joe was preparing his
birch horn and pitching his canoe,&mdash;for this had to be
done whenever we stopped long enough to build a fire,
and was the principal labor which he took upon himself
at such times,&mdash;we collected fuel for the night,
large, wet, and rotting logs, which had lodged at the
head of the island, for our hatchet was too small for
effective chopping; but we did not kindle a fire, lest
the moose should smell it. Joe set up a couple of
forked stakes, and prepared half a dozen poles, ready
to cast one of our blankets over in case it rained in the
night, which precaution, however, was omitted the next
night. We also plucked the ducks which had been
killed for breakfast.

While we were thus engaged in the twilight, we
heard faintly, from far down the stream, what sounded
like two strokes of a woodchopper's axe, echoing dully
through the grim solitude. We are wont to liken many
sounds, heard at a distance in the forest, to the stroke
of an axe, because they resemble each other under those
circumstances, and that is the one we commonly hear
there. When we told Joe of this, he exclaimed, "By
George, I'll bet that was a moose! They make a noise
like that." These sounds affected us strangely, and by
their very resemblance to a familiar one, where they
111
probably had so different an origin, enhanced the impression
of solitude and wildness.

At starlight we dropped down the stream, which was
a deadwater for three miles, or as far as the Moosehorn;
Joe telling us that we must be very silent, and
he himself making no noise with his paddle, while he
urged the canoe along with effective impulses. It was
a still night, and suitable for this purpose,&mdash;for if
there is wind, the moose will smell you,&mdash;and Joe was
very confident that he should get some. The Harvest
Moon had just risen, and its level rays began to light
up the forest on our right, while we glided downward
in the shade on the same side, against the little breeze
that was stirring. The lofty, spiring tops of the spruce
and fir were very black against the sky, and more distinct
than by day, close bordering this broad avenue on
each side; and the beauty of the scene, as the moon
rose above the forest, it would not be easy to describe.
A bat flew over our heads, and we heard a few faint
notes of birds from time to time, perhaps the myrtle-bird
for one, or the sudden plunge of a musquash, or
saw one crossing the stream before us, or heard the
sound of a rill emptying in, swollen by the recent rain.
About a mile below the island, when the solitude
seemed to be growing more complete every moment,
we suddenly saw the light and heard the crackling of a
fire on the bank, and discovered the camp of the two
explorers; they standing before it in their red shirts, and
talking aloud of the adventures and profits of the day.
They were just then speaking of a bargain, in which,
as I understood, somebody had cleared twenty-five
112
dollars. We glided by without speaking, close under
the bank, within a couple of rods of them; and Joe,
taking his horn, imitated the call of the moose, till we
suggested that they might fire on us. This was the last
we saw of them, and we never knew whether they detected
or suspected us.

I have often wished since that I was with them.
They search for timber over a given section, climbing
hills and often high trees to look off; explore the
streams by which it is to be driven, and the like; spend
five or six weeks in the woods, they two alone, a hundred
miles or more from any town, roaming about,
and sleeping on the ground where night overtakes
them, depending chiefly on the provisions they carry
with them, though they do not decline what game they
come across; and then in the fall they return and make
report to their employers, determining the number of
teams that will be required the following winter. Experienced
men get three or four dollars a day for this
work. It is a solitary and adventurous life, and comes
nearest to that of the trapper of the West, perhaps.
They work ever with a gun as well as an axe, let their
beards grow, and live without neighbors, not on an
open plain, but far within a wilderness.

This discovery accounted for the sounds which we
had heard, and destroyed the prospect of seeing moose
yet awhile. At length, when we had left the explorers
far behind, Joe laid down his paddle, drew forth his
birch horn,&mdash;a straight one, about fifteen inches long
and three or four wide at the mouth, tied round with
strips of the same bark,&mdash;and, standing up, imitated
113
the call of the moose,&mdash;ugh-ugh-ugh, or oo-oo-oo-oo,
and then a prolonged oo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o, and listened
attentively for several minutes. We asked him what
kind of noise he expected to hear. He said that if a
moose heard it, he guessed we should find out; we
should hear him coming half a mile off; he would come
close to, perhaps into, the water, and my companion
must wait till he got fair sight, and then aim just
behind the shoulder.

The moose venture out to the riverside to feed and
drink at night. Earlier in the season the hunters do
not use a horn to call them out, but steal upon them
as they are feeding along the sides of the stream, and
often the first notice they have of one is the sound of
the water dropping from its muzzle. An Indian whom
I heard imitate the voice of the moose, and also that
of the caribou and the deer, using a much longer horn
than Joe's, told me that the first could be heard eight
or ten miles, sometimes; it was a loud sort of bellowing
sound, clearer and more sonorous than the lowing of
cattle, the caribou's a sort of snort, and the small deer's
like that of a lamb.

At length we turned up the Moosehorn, where the
Indians at the carry had told us that they killed a
moose the night before. This is a very meandering
stream, only a rod or two in width, but comparatively
deep, coming in on the right, fitly enough named Moosehorn,
whether from its windings or its inhabitants. It
was bordered here and there by narrow meadows between
the stream and the endless forest, affording
favorable places for the moose to feed, and to call them
114
out on. We proceeded half a mile up this as through
a narrow, winding canal, where the tall, dark spruce
and firs and arbor-vitæ towered on both sides in the
moonlight, forming a perpendicular forest-edge of great
height, like the spires of a Venice in the forest. In two
places stood a small stack of hay on the bank, ready
for the lumberer's use in the winter, looking strange
enough there. We thought of the day when this might
be a brook winding through smooth-shaven meadows
on some gentleman's grounds; and seen by moonlight
then, excepting the forest that now hems it in, how little
changed it would appear!

Again and again Joe called the moose, placing the
canoe close by some favorable point of meadow for
them to come out on, but listened in vain to hear one
come rushing through the woods, and concluded that
they had been hunted too much thereabouts. We saw,
many times, what to our imaginations looked like a
gigantic moose, with his horns peering from out the
forest edge; but we saw the forest only, and not its
inhabitants, that night. So at last we turned about.
There was now a little fog on the water, though it was
a fine, clear night above. There were very few sounds
to break the stillness of the forest. Several times we
heard the hooting of a great horned owl, as at home,
and told Joe that he would call out the moose for him,
for he made a sound considerably like the horn; but
Joe answered, that the moose had heard that sound a
thousand times, and knew better; and oftener still we
were startled by the plunge of a musquash. Once, when
Joe had called again, and we were listening for moose,
115
we heard, come faintly echoing, or creeping from far
through the moss-clad aisles, a dull, dry, rushing sound
with a solid core to it, yet as if half smothered under
the grasp of the luxuriant and fungus-like forest, like
the shutting of a door in some distant entry of the
damp and shaggy wilderness. If we had not been there,
no mortal had heard it. When we asked Joe in a whisper
what it was, he answered, "Tree fall." There is
something singularly grand and impressive in the sound
of a tree falling in a perfectly calm night like this, as
if the agencies which overthrow it did not need to be
excited, but worked with a subtle, deliberate, and conscious
force, like a boa-constrictor, and more effectively
then than even in a windy day. If there is any such
difference, perhaps it is because trees with the dews of
the night on them are heavier than by day.

Having reached the camp, about ten o'clock, we
kindled our fire and went to bed. Each of us had a
blanket, in which he lay on the fir twigs, with his extremities
toward the fire, but nothing over his head. It
was worth the while to lie down in a country where you
could afford such great fires; that was one whole side,
and the bright side, of our world. We had first rolled
up a large log some eighteen inches through and ten
feet long, for a backlog, to last all night, and then piled
on the trees to the height of three or four feet, no matter
how green or damp. In fact, we burned as much
wood that night as would, with economy and an air-tight
stove, last a poor family in one of our cities all
winter. It was very agreeable, as well as independent,
thus lying in the open air, and the fire kept our uncovered
116
extremities warm enough. The Jesuit missionaries
used to say, that, in their journeys with the
Indians in Canada, they lay on a bed which had never
been shaken up since the creation, unless by earthquakes.
It is surprising with what impunity and comfort
one who has always lain in a warm bed in a close
apartment, and studiously avoided drafts of air, can
lie down on the ground without a shelter, roll himself
in a blanket, and sleep before a fire, in a frosty autumn
night, just after a long rain-storm, and even come soon
to enjoy and value the fresh air.

I lay awake awhile, watching the ascent of the sparks
through the firs, and sometimes their descent in half-extinguished
cinders on my blanket. They were as
interesting as fireworks, going up in endless, successive
crowds, each after an explosion, in an eager, serpentine
course, some to five or six rods above the tree-tops before
they went out. We do not suspect how much our
chimneys have concealed; and now air-tight stoves
have come to conceal all the rest. In the course of the
night, I got up once or twice and put fresh logs on the
fire, making my companions curl up their legs.

When we awoke in the morning (Saturday, September
17), there was considerable frost whitening the
leaves. We heard the sound of the chickadee, and a
few faintly lisping birds, and also of ducks in the water
about the island. I took a botanical account of stock
of our domains before the dew was off, and found that
the ground-hemlock, or American yew, was the prevailing
undershrub. We breakfasted on tea, hard-bread,
and ducks.
117

Before the fog had fairly cleared away we paddled
down the stream again, and were soon past the mouth
of the Moosehorn. These twenty miles of the Penobscot,
between Moosehead and Chesuncook lakes, are
comparatively smooth, and a great part deadwater; but
from time to time it is shallow and rapid, with rocks or
gravel beds, where you can wade across. There is no
expanse of water, and no break in the forest, and the
meadow is a mere edging here and there. There are
no hills near the river nor within sight, except one or
two distant mountains seen in a few places. The
banks are from six to ten feet high, but once or twice
rise gently to higher ground. In many places the forest
on the bank was but a thin strip, letting the light
through from some alder swamp or meadow behind.
The conspicuous berry-bearing bushes and trees along
the shore were the red osier, with its whitish fruit,
hobble-bush, mountain-ash, tree-cranberry, choke-cherry,
now ripe, alternate cornel, and naked viburnum.
Following Joe's example, I ate the fruit of the
last, and also of the hobble-bush, but found them rather
insipid and seedy. I looked very narrowly at the vegetation,
as we glided along close to the shore, and frequently
made Joe turn aside for me to pluck a plant,
that I might see by comparison what was primitive
about my native river. Horehound, horse-mint, and
the sensitive fern grew close to the edge, under the willows
and alders, and wool-grass on the islands, as along
the Assabet River in Concord. It was too late for
flowers, except a few asters, goldenrods, etc. In several
places we noticed the slight frame of a camp, such
118
as we had prepared to set up, amid the forest by the
riverside, where some lumberers or hunters had passed
a night, and sometimes steps cut in the muddy or
clayey bank in front of it.

We stopped to fish for trout at the mouth of a small
stream called Ragmuff, which came in from the west,
about two miles below the Moosehorn. Here were the
ruins of an old lumbering-camp, and a small space,
which had formerly been cleared and burned over,
was now densely overgrown with the red cherry and
raspberries. While we were trying for trout, Joe,
Indian-like, wandered off up the Ragmuff on his own
errands, and when we were ready to start was far beyond
call. So we were compelled to make a fire and get our
dinner here, not to lose time. Some dark reddish birds,
with grayer females (perhaps purple finches), and
myrtle-birds in their summer dress, hopped within six
or eight feet of us and our smoke. Perhaps they smelled
the frying pork. The latter bird, or both, made the
lisping notes which I had heard in the forest. They
suggested that the few small birds found in the wilderness
are on more familiar terms with the lumberman
and hunter than those of the orchard and clearing with
the farmer. I have since found the Canada jay, and
partridges, both the black and the common, equally
tame there, as if they had not yet learned to mistrust
man entirely. The chickadee, which is at home alike
in the primitive woods and in our wood-lots, still retains
its confidence in the towns to a remarkable
degree.

Joe at length returned, after an hour and a half, and
119
said that he had been two miles up the stream exploring,
and had seen a moose, but, not having the gun, he
did not get him. We made no complaint, but concluded
to look out for Joe the next time. However, this may
have been a mere mistake, for we had no reason to
complain of him afterwards. As we continued down
the stream, I was surprised to hear him whistling "O
Susanna" and several other such airs, while his paddle
urged us along. Once he said, "Yes, sir-ee." His
common word was "Sartain." He paddled, as usual,
on one side only, giving the birch an impulse by
using the side as a fulcrum. I asked him how the
ribs were fastened to the side rails. He answered, "I
don't know, I never noticed." Talking with him about
subsisting wholly on what the woods yielded,&mdash;game,
fish, berries, etc.,&mdash;I suggested that his ancestors did
so; but he answered that he had been brought up in
such a way that he could not do it. "Yes," said he,
"that's the way they got a living, like wild fellows,
wild as bears. By George! I shan't go into the woods
without provision,&mdash;hard-bread, pork, etc." He had
brought on a barrel of hard-bread and stored it at
the carry for his hunting. However, though he was
a Governor's son, he had not learned to read.

At one place below this, on the east side, where the
bank was higher and drier than usual, rising gently
from the shore to a slight elevation, some one had felled
the trees over twenty or thirty acres, and left them
drying in order to burn. This was the only preparation
for a house between the Moosehead Carry and Chesuncook,
but there was no hut nor inhabitants there
120
yet. The pioneer thus selects a site for his house,
which will, perhaps, prove the germ of a town.

My eyes were all the while on the trees, distinguishing
between the black and white spruce and the fir.
You paddle along in a narrow canal through an endless
forest, and the vision I have in my mind's eye, still, is
of the small, dark, and sharp tops of tall fir and spruce
trees, and pagoda-like arbor-vitæs, crowded together on
each side, with various hard woods intermixed. Some
of the arbor-vitæs were at least sixty feet high. The
hard woods, occasionally occurring exclusively, were less
wild to my eye. I fancied them ornamental grounds,
with farmhouses in the rear. The canoe and yellow
birch, beech, maple, and elm are Saxon and Norman,
but the spruce and fir, and pines generally, are Indian.
The soft engravings which adorn the annuals give no
idea of a stream in such a wilderness as this. The
rough sketches in Jackson's Reports on the Geology of
Maine answer much better. At one place we saw a
small grove of slender sapling white pines, the only
collection of pines that I saw on this voyage. Here
and there, however, was a full-grown, tall, and slender,
but defective one, what lumbermen call a konchus tree,
which they ascertain with their axes, or by the knots.
I did not learn whether this word was Indian or English.
It reminded me of the Greek κόγχη, a conch or
shell, and I amused myself with fancying that it might
signify the dead sound which the trees yield when
struck. All the rest of the pines had been driven off.

How far men go for the material of their houses!
The inhabitants of the most civilized cities, in all ages,
121
send into far, primitive forests, beyond the bounds of
their civilization, where the moose and bear and savage
dwell, for their pine boards for ordinary use. And, on
the other hand, the savage soon receives from cities
iron arrow-points, hatchets, and guns, to point his
savageness with.

The solid and well-defined fir-tops, like sharp and
regular spearheads, black against the sky, gave a peculiar,
dark, and sombre look to the forest. The spruce-tops
have a similar but more ragged outline, their
shafts also merely feathered below. The firs were
somewhat oftener regular and dense pyramids. I was
struck by this universal spiring upward of the forest
evergreens. The tendency is to slender, spiring tops,
while they are narrower below. Not only the spruce
and fir, but even the arbor-vitæ and white pine, unlike
the soft, spreading second-growth, of which I saw
none, all spire upwards, lifting a dense spearhead of
cones to the light and air, at any rate, while their
branches straggle after as they may; as Indians lift the
ball over the heads of the crowd in their desperate
game. In this they resemble grasses, as also palms
somewhat. The hemlock is commonly a tent-like pyramid
from the ground to its summit.

After passing through some long rips, and by a
large island, we reached an interesting part of the
river called the Pine Stream Deadwater, about six
miles below Ragmuff, where the river expanded to
thirty rods in width and had many islands in it, with
elms and canoe-birches, now yellowing, along the
shore, and we got our first sight of Ktaadn.
122

Here, about two o'clock, we turned up a small
branch three or four rods wide, which comes in on the
right from the south, called Pine Stream, to look for
moose signs. We had gone but a few rods before we
saw very recent signs along the water's edge, the mud
lifted up by their feet being quite fresh, and Joe declared
that they had gone along there but a short time
before. We soon reached a small meadow on the east
side, at an angle in the stream, which was, for the
most part, densely covered with alders. As we were
advancing along the edge of this, rather more quietly
than usual, perhaps, on account of the freshness of the
signs,&mdash;the design being to camp up this stream, if it
promised well,&mdash;I heard a slight crackling of twigs
deep in the alders, and turned Joe's attention to it;
whereupon he began to push the canoe back rapidly;
and we had receded thus half a dozen rods, when we
suddenly spied two moose standing just on the edge
of the open part of the meadow which we had passed,
not more than six or seven rods distant, looking round
the alders at us. They made me think of great frightened
rabbits, with their long ears and half-inquisitive,
half-frightened looks; the true denizens of the forest
(I saw at once), filling a vacuum which now first I
discovered had not been filled for me,&mdash;moose-men,
wood-eaters, the word is said to mean,&mdash;clad in a sort
of Vermont gray, or homespun. Our Nimrod, owing to
the retrograde movement, was now the farthest from the
game; but being warned of its neighborhood, he hastily
stood up, and, while we ducked, fired over our heads
one barrel at the foremost, which alone he saw, though
123
he did not know what kind of creature it was; whereupon
this one dashed across the meadow and up a high
bank on the northeast, so rapidly as to leave but an
indistinct impression of its outlines on my mind. At
the same instant, the other, a young one, but as tall as
a horse, leaped out into the stream, in full sight, and
there stood cowering for a moment, or rather its disproportionate
lowness behind gave it that appearance,
and uttering two or three trumpeting squeaks. I have
an indistinct recollection of seeing the old one pause
an instant on the top of the bank in the woods, look
toward its shivering young, and then dash away again.
The second barrel was leveled at the calf, and when
we expected to see it drop in the water, after a little
hesitation, it, too, got out of the water, and dashed up
the hill, though in a somewhat different direction. All
this was the work of a few seconds, and our hunter,
having never seen a moose before, did not know but
they were deer, for they stood partly in the water, nor
whether he had fired at the same one twice or not.
From the style in which they went off, and the fact
that he was not used to standing up and firing from a
canoe, I judged that we should not see anything more
of them. The Indian said that they were a cow and
her calf,&mdash;a yearling, or perhaps two years old, for
they accompany their dams so long; but, for my part,
I had not noticed much difference in their size. It was
but two or three rods across the meadow to the foot
of the bank, which, like all the world thereabouts, was
densely wooded; but I was surprised to notice, that,
as soon as the moose had passed behind the veil of the
124
woods, there was no sound of footsteps to be heard
from the soft, damp moss which carpets that forest,
and long before we landed, perfect silence reigned.
Joe said, "If you wound 'em moose, me sure get
'em."

We all landed at once. My companion reloaded; the
Indian fastened his birch, threw off his hat, adjusted
his waistband, seized the hatchet, and set out. He told
me afterward, casually, that before we landed he had
seen a drop of blood on the bank, when it was two or
three rods off. He proceeded rapidly up the bank and
through the woods, with a peculiar, elastic, noiseless, and
stealthy tread, looking to right and left on the ground,
and stepping in the faint tracks of the wounded moose,
now and then pointing in silence to a single drop of
blood on the handsome, shining leaves of the Clintonia
borealis, which, on every side, covered the ground, or
to a dry fern stem freshly broken, all the while chewing
some leaf or else the spruce gum. I followed, watching
his motions more than the trail of the moose. After
following the trail about forty rods in a pretty direct
course, stepping over fallen trees and winding between
standing ones, he at length lost it, for there were many
other moose-tracks there, and, returning once more to
the last blood-stain, traced it a little way and lost it
again, and, too soon, I thought, for a good hunter, gave
it up entirely. He traced a few steps, also, the tracks
of the calf; but, seeing no blood, soon relinquished the
search.

I observed, while he was tracking the moose, a certain
reticence or moderation in him. He did not communicate
125
several observations of interest which he made,
as a white man would have done, though they may have
leaked out afterward. At another time, when we heard
a slight crackling of twigs and he landed to reconnoitre,
he stepped lightly and gracefully, stealing through
the bushes with the least possible noise, in a way in
which no white man does,&mdash;as it were, finding a place
for his foot each time.

About half an hour after seeing the moose, we pursued
our voyage up Pine Stream, and soon, coming to
a part which was very shoal and also rapid, we took
out the baggage, and proceeded to carry it round, while
Joe got up with the canoe alone. We were just completing
our portage and I was absorbed in the plants,
admiring the leaves of the Aster macrophyllus, ten
inches wide, and plucking the seeds of the great round-leaved
orchis, when Joe exclaimed from the stream
that he had killed a moose. He had found the cow
moose lying dead, but quite warm, in the middle of
the stream, which was so shallow that it rested on the
bottom, with hardly a third of its body above water.
It was about an hour after it was shot, and it was
swollen with water. It had run about a hundred rods
and sought the stream again, cutting off a slight bend.
No doubt a better hunter would have tracked it to this
spot at once. I was surprised at its great size, horse-like,
but Joe said it was not a large cow moose. My
companion went in search of the calf again. I took
hold of the ears of the moose, while Joe pushed his
canoe down-stream toward a favorable shore, and so
we made out, though with some difficulty, its long nose
126
frequently sticking in the bottom, to drag it into still
shallower water. It was a brownish-black, or perhaps
a dark iron-gray, on the back and sides, but lighter
beneath and in front. I took the cord which served for
the canoe's painter, and with Joe's assistance measured
it carefully, the greatest distances first, making a knot
each time. The painter being wanted, I reduced these
measures that night with equal care to lengths and fractions
of my umbrella, beginning with the smallest measures,
and untying the knots as I proceeded; and when
we arrived at Chesuncook the next day, finding a two-foot
rule there, I reduced the last to feet and inches;
and, moreover, I made myself a two-foot rule of a thin
and narrow strip of black ash, which would fold up
conveniently to six inches. All this pains I took because
I did not wish to be obliged to say merely that
the moose was very large. Of the various dimensions
which I obtained I will mention only two. The distance
from the tips of the hoofs of the fore feet, stretched out,
to the top of the back between the shoulders, was seven
feet and five inches. I can hardly believe my own measure,
for this is about two feet greater than the height
of a tall horse. (Indeed, I am now satisfied that this
measurement was incorrect, but the other measures
given here I can warrant to be correct, having proved
them in a more recent visit to those woods.) The extreme
length was eight feet and two inches. Another
cow moose, which I have since measured in those woods
with a tape, was just six feet from the tip of the hoof
to the shoulders, and eight feet long as she lay.

When afterward I asked an Indian at the carry how
127
much taller the male was, he answered, "Eighteen
inches," and made me observe the height of a cross-stake
over the fire, more than four feet from the ground,
to give me some idea of the depth of his chest. Another
Indian, at Oldtown, told me that they were nine
feet high to the top of the back, and that one which he
tried weighed eight hundred pounds. The length of
the spinal projections between the shoulders is very
great. A white hunter, who was the best authority
among hunters that I could have, told me that the male
was not eighteen inches taller than the female; yet he
agreed that he was sometimes nine feet high to the top
of the back, and weighed a thousand pounds. Only
the male has horns, and they rise two feet or more
above the shoulders,&mdash;spreading three or four, and
sometimes six feet,&mdash;which would make him in all,
sometimes, eleven feet high! According to this calculation,
the moose is as tall, though it may not be as
large, as the great Irish elk, Megaceros Hibernicus, of a
former period, of which Mantell says that it "very far
exceeded in magnitude any living species, the skeleton"
being "upward of ten feet high from the ground to the
highest point of the antlers." Joe said, that, though
the moose shed the whole horn annually, each new
horn has an additional prong; but I have noticed that
they sometimes have more prongs on one side than on
the other. I was struck with the delicacy and tenderness
of the hoofs, which divide very far up, and the
one half could be pressed very much behind the other,
thus probably making the animal surer-footed on the
uneven ground and slippery moss-covered logs of the
128
primitive forest. They were very unlike the stiff and
battered feet of our horses and oxen. The bare, horny
part of the fore foot was just six inches long, and the
two portions could be separated four inches at the
extremities.

The moose is singularly grotesque and awkward to
look at. Why should it stand so high at the shoulders?
Why have so long a head? Why have no tail to speak
of? for in my examination I overlooked it entirely.
Naturalists say it is an inch and a half long. It reminded
me at once of the camelopard, high before and
low behind,&mdash;and no wonder, for, like it, it is fitted to
browse on trees. The upper lip projected two inches
beyond the lower for this purpose. This was the kind
of man that was at home there; for, as near as I can
learn, that has never been the residence, but rather the
hunting-ground of the Indian. The moose will, perhaps,
one day become extinct; but how naturally then, when
it exists only as a fossil relic, and unseen as that, may
the poet or sculptor invent a fabulous animal with similar
branching and leafy horns,&mdash;a sort of fucus or lichen
in bone,&mdash;to be the inhabitant of such a forest as this!

Here, just at the head of the murmuring rapids, Joe
now proceeded to skin the moose with a pocket-knife,
while I looked on; and a tragical business it was,&mdash;to
see that still warm and palpitating body pierced with a
knife, to see the warm milk stream from the rent udder,
and the ghastly naked red carcass appearing from within
its seemly robe, which was made to hide it. The ball
had passed through the shoulder-blade diagonally and
lodged under the skin on the opposite side, and was
129
partially flattened. My companion keeps it to show to
his grandchildren. He has the shanks of another moose
which he has since shot, skinned and stuffed, ready to
be made into boots by putting in a thick leather sole.
Joe said, if a moose stood fronting you, you must not
fire, but advance toward him, for he will turn slowly
and give you a fair shot. In the bed of this narrow,
wild, and rocky stream, between two lofty walls of
spruce and firs, a mere cleft in the forest which the
stream had made, this work went on. At length Joe
had stripped off the hide and dragged it trailing to the
shore, declaring that it weighed a hundred pounds,
though probably fifty would have been nearer the truth.
He cut off a large mass of the meat to carry along, and
another, together with the tongue and nose, he put with
the hide on the shore to lie there all night, or till we
returned. I was surprised that he thought of leaving
this meat thus exposed by the side of the carcass, as
the simplest course, not fearing that any creature would
touch it; but nothing did. This could hardly have happened
on the bank of one of our rivers in the eastern
part of Massachusetts; but I suspect that fewer small
wild animals are prowling there than with us. Twice,
however, in this excursion, I had a glimpse of a species of
large mouse.

This stream was so withdrawn, and the moose-tracks
were so fresh, that my companions, still bent on hunting,
concluded to go farther up it and camp, and then
hunt up or down at night. Half a mile above this, at a
place where I saw the Aster puniceus and the beaked
hazel, as we paddled along, Joe, hearing a slight rustling
130
amid the alders, and seeing something black about
two rods off, jumped up and whispered, "Bear!" but
before the hunter had discharged his piece, he corrected
himself to "Beaver!"&mdash;"Hedgehog!" The bullet
killed a large hedgehog more than two feet and eight
inches long. The quills were rayed out and flattened
on the hinder part of its back, even as if it had lain
on that part, but were erect and long between this and
the tail. Their points, closely examined, were seen to
be finely bearded or barbed, and shaped like an awl,
that is, a little concave, to give the barbs effect. After
about a mile of still water, we prepared our camp on
the right side, just at the foot of a considerable fall.
Little chopping was done that night, for fear of scaring
the moose. We had moose meat fried for supper. It
tasted like tender beef, with perhaps more flavor,&mdash;sometimes
like veal.

After supper, the moon having risen, we proceeded
to hunt a mile up this stream, first "carrying" about
the falls. We made a picturesque sight, wending single
file along the shore, climbing over rocks and logs, Joe,
who brought up the rear, twirling his canoe in his
hands as if it were a feather, in places where it was
difficult to get along without a burden. We launched
the canoe again from the ledge over which the stream
fell, but after half a mile of still water, suitable for
hunting, it became rapid again, and we were compelled
to make our way along the shore, while Joe endeavored
to get up in the birch alone, though it was still very
difficult for him to pick his way amid the rocks in the
night. We on the shore found the worst of walking, a
131
perfect chaos of fallen and drifted trees, and of bushes
projecting far over the water, and now and then we
made our way across the mouth of a small tributary on
a kind of network of alders. So we went tumbling on
in the dark, being on the shady side, effectually scaring
all the moose and bears that might be thereabouts. At
length we came to a standstill, and Joe went forward
to reconnoitre; but he reported that it was still a continuous
rapid as far as he went, or half a mile, with no
prospect of improvement, as if it were coming down
from a mountain. So we turned about, hunting back
to the camp through the still water. It was a splendid
moonlight night, and I, getting sleepy as it grew late,&mdash;for
I had nothing to do,&mdash;found it difficult to realize
where I was. This stream was much more unfrequented
than the main one, lumbering operations being no longer
carried on in this quarter. It was only three or four
rods wide, but the firs and spruce through which it
trickled seemed yet taller by contrast. Being in this
dreamy state, which the moonlight enhanced, I did not
clearly discern the shore, but seemed, most of the time,
to be floating through ornamental grounds,&mdash;for I
associated the fir-tops with such scenes;&mdash;very high
up some Broadway, and beneath or between their tops,
I thought I saw an endless succession of porticoes and
columns, cornices and façades, verandas and churches.
I did not merely fancy this, but in my drowsy state such
was the illusion. I fairly lost myself in sleep several
times, still dreaming of that architecture and the nobility
that dwelt behind and might issue from it: but all at
once I would be aroused and brought back to a sense
132
of my actual position by the sound of Joe's birch horn
in the midst of all this silence calling the moose, ugh,
ugh, oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo, and I prepared to hear a furious
moose come rushing and crashing through the forest,
and see him burst out on to the little strip of meadow
by our side.

But, on more accounts than one, I had had enough
of moose-hunting. I had not come to the woods for
this purpose, nor had I foreseen it, though I had been
willing to learn how the Indian man&oelig;uvred; but one
moose killed was as good, if not as bad, as a dozen.
The afternoon's tragedy, and my share in it, as it
affected the innocence, destroyed the pleasure of my
adventure. It is true, I came as near as is possible to
come to being a hunter and miss it, myself; and as it
is, I think that I could spend a year in the woods, fishing
and hunting just enough to sustain myself, with
satisfaction. This would be next to living like a philosopher
on the fruits of the earth which you had raised,
which also attracts me. But this hunting of the moose
merely for the satisfaction of killing him,&mdash;not even
for the sake of his hide,&mdash;without making any extraordinary
exertion or running any risk yourself, is too
much like going out by night to some wood-side pasture
and shooting your neighbor's horses. These are God's
own horses, poor, timid creatures, that will run fast
enough as soon as they smell you, though they are nine
feet high. Joe told us of some hunters who a year or
two before had shot down several oxen by night, somewhere
in the Maine woods, mistaking them for moose.
And so might any of the hunters; and what is the
133
difference in the sport, but the name? In the former
case, having killed one of God's and your own oxen,
you strip off its hide,&mdash;because that is the common
trophy, and, moreover, you have heard that it may be
sold for moccasins,&mdash;cut a steak from its haunches, and
leave the huge carcass to smell to heaven for you. It is
no better, at least, than to assist at a slaughter-house.

This afternoon's experience suggested to me how
base or coarse are the motives which commonly carry
men into the wilderness. The explorers and lumberers
generally are all hirelings, paid so much a day for their
labor, and as such they have no more love for wild
nature than wood-sawyers have for forests. Other white
men and Indians who come here are for the most part
hunters, whose object is to slay as many moose and
other wild animals as possible. But, pray, could not
one spend some weeks or years in the solitude of this
vast wilderness with other employments than these,&mdash;employments
perfectly sweet and innocent and ennobling?
For one that comes with a pencil to sketch or
sing, a thousand come with an axe or rifle. What a
coarse and imperfect use Indians and hunters make of
nature! No wonder that their race is so soon exterminated.
I already, and for weeks afterward, felt my
nature the coarser for this part of my woodland experience,
and was reminded that our life should be lived
as tenderly and daintily as one would pluck a flower.

With these thoughts, when we reached our camping-ground,
I decided to leave my companions to continue
moose-hunting down the stream, while I prepared the
camp, though they requested me not to chop much nor
134
make a large fire, for fear I should scare their game.
In the midst of the damp fir wood, high on the mossy
bank, about nine o'clock of this bright moonlight night,
I kindled a fire, when they were gone, and, sitting on
the fir twigs, within sound of the falls, examined by its
light the botanical specimens which I had collected
that afternoon, and wrote down some of the reflections
which I have here expanded; or I walked along the
shore and gazed up the stream, where the whole space
above the falls was filled with mellow light. As I sat
before the fire on my fir-twig seat, without walls above
or around me, I remembered how far on every hand
that wilderness stretched, before you came to cleared or
cultivated fields, and wondered if any bear or moose was
watching the light of my fire; for Nature looked sternly
upon me on account of the murder of the moose.

Strange that so few ever come to the woods to see
how the pine lives and grows and spires, lifting its
evergreen arms to the light,&mdash;to see its perfect success;
but most are content to behold it in the shape of
many broad boards brought to market, and deem that
its true success! But the pine is no more lumber than
man is, and to be made into boards and houses is no
more its true and highest use than the truest use of a
man is to be cut down and made into manure. There
is a higher law affecting our relation to pines as well
as to men. A pine cut down, a dead pine, is no more a
pine than a dead human carcass is a man. Can he who
has discovered only some of the values of whalebone
and whale oil be said to have discovered the true use
of the whale? Can he who slays the elephant for his
135
ivory be said to have "seen the elephant"? These are
petty and accidental uses; just as if a stronger race
were to kill us in order to make buttons and flageolets
of our bones; for everything may serve a lower as well
as a higher use. Every creature is better alive than dead,
men and moose and pine trees, and he who understands
it aright will rather preserve its life than destroy it.



Pine Tree, Boar Mountain


Is it the lumberman, then, who is the friend and lover
of the pine, stands nearest to it, and understands its
nature best? Is it the tanner who has barked it, or he
who has boxed it for turpentine, whom posterity will
fable to have been changed into a pine at last? No!
no! it is the poet; he it is who makes the truest use of
the pine, who does not fondle it with an axe, nor tickle
it with a saw, nor stroke it with a plane, who knows
whether its heart is false without cutting into it, who
has not bought the stumpage of the township on which
it stands. All the pines shudder and heave a sigh when
that man steps on the forest floor. No, it is the poet,
who loves them as his own shadow in the air, and lets
them stand. I have been into the lumber-yard, and the
carpenter's shop, and the tannery, and the lampblack
factory, and the turpentine clearing; but when at length
I saw the tops of the pines waving and reflecting the
light at a distance high over all the rest of the forest, I
realized that the former were not the highest use of the
pine. It is not their bones or hide or tallow that I love
most. It is the living spirit of the tree, not its spirit of
turpentine, with which I sympathize, and which heals
my cuts. It is as immortal as I am, and perchance will
go to as high a heaven, there to tower above me still.
136

Ere long, the hunters returned, not having seen a
moose, but, in consequence of my suggestions, bringing
a quarter of the dead one, which, with ourselves, made
quite a load for the canoe.

After breakfasting on moose meat, we returned down
Pine Stream on our way to Chesuncook Lake, which was
about five miles distant. We could see the red carcass
of the moose lying in Pine Stream when nearly half a
mile off. Just below the mouth of this stream were the
most considerable rapids between the two lakes, called
Pine Stream Falls, where were large flat rocks washed
smooth, and at this time you could easily wade across
above them. Joe ran down alone while we walked over
the portage, my companion collecting spruce gum for
his friends at home, and I looking for flowers. Near
the lake, which we were approaching with as much expectation
as if it had been a university,&mdash;for it is not
often that the stream of our life opens into such expansions,&mdash;were
islands, and a low and meadowy shore
with scattered trees, birches, white and yellow, slanted
over the water, and maples,&mdash;many of the white birches
killed, apparently by inundations. There was considerable
native grass; and even a few cattle&mdash;whose movements
we heard, though we did not see them, mistaking
them at first for moose&mdash;were pastured there.

On entering the lake, where the stream runs southeasterly,
and for some time before, we had a view of
the mountains about Ktaadn (Katahdinauquoh one says
they are called), like a cluster of blue fungi of rank
growth, apparently twenty-five or thirty miles distant,
in a southeast direction, their summits concealed by
137
clouds. Joe called some of them the Sowadnehunk
Mountains. This is the name of a stream there, which
another Indian told us meant "running between mountains."
Though some lower summits were afterward
uncovered, we got no more complete view of Ktaadn
while we were in the woods. The clearing to which we
were bound was on the right of the mouth of the river,
and was reached by going round a low point, where the
water was shallow to a great distance from the shore.
Chesuncook Lake extends northwest and southeast, and
is called eighteen miles long and three wide, without
an island. We had entered the northwest corner of it,
and when near the shore could see only part way
down it. The principal mountains visible from the land
here were those already mentioned, between southeast
and east, and a few summits a little west of north, but
generally the north and northwest horizon about the
St. John and the British boundary was comparatively
level.

Ansell Smith's, the oldest and principal clearing about
this lake, appeared to be quite a harbor for batteaux
and canoes; seven or eight of the former were lying
about, and there was a small scow for hay, and a capstan
on a platform, now high and dry, ready to be floated and
anchored to tow rafts with. It was a very primitive kind
of harbor, where boats were drawn up amid the stumps,&mdash;such
a one, methought, as the Argo might have been
launched in. There were five other huts with small
clearings on the opposite side of the lake, all at this end
and visible from this point. One of the Smiths told me
that it was so far cleared that they came here to live and
138
built the present house four years before, though the
family had been here but a few months.

I was interested to see how a pioneer lived on this side
of the country. His life is in some respects more adventurous
than that of his brother in the West; for he contends
with winter as well as the wilderness, and there is
a greater interval of time at least between him and the
army which is to follow. Here immigration is a tide
which may ebb when it has swept away the pines; there
it is not a tide, but an inundation, and roads and other
improvements come steadily rushing after.

As we approached the log house, a dozen rods from
the lake, and considerably elevated above it, the projecting
ends of the logs lapping over each other irregularly
several feet at the corners gave it a very rich
and picturesque look, far removed from the meanness
of weather-boards. It was a very spacious, low building,
about eighty feet long, with many large apartments.
The walls were well clayed between the logs, which were
large and round, except on the upper and under sides,
and as visible inside as out, successive bulging cheeks
gradually lessening upwards and tuned to each other
with the axe, like Pandean pipes. Probably the musical
forest gods had not yet cast them aside; they never do
till they are split or the bark is gone. It was a style of
architecture not described by Vitruvius, I suspect, though
possibly hinted at in the biography of Orpheus; none
of your frilled or fluted columns, which have cut such
a false swell, and support nothing but a gable end and
their builder's pretensions,&mdash;that is, with the multitude;
and as for "ornamentation," one of those words with a
139
dead tail which architects very properly use to describe
their flourishes, there were the lichens and mosses and
fringes of bark, which nobody troubled himself about.
We certainly leave the handsomest paint and clapboards
behind in the woods, when we strip off the bark and
poison ourselves with white-lead in the towns. We get
but half the spoils of the forest. For beauty, give me
trees with the fur on. This house was designed and
constructed with the freedom of stroke of a forester's
axe, without other compass and square than Nature
uses. Wherever the logs were cut off by a window or
door, that is, were not kept in place by alternate overlapping,
they were held one upon another by very large
pins, driven in diagonally on each side, where branches
might have been, and then cut off so close up and down
as not to project beyond the bulge of the log, as if the
logs clasped each other in their arms. These logs were
posts, studs, boards, clapboards, laths, plaster, and nails,
all in one. Where the citizen uses a mere sliver or board,
the pioneer uses the whole trunk of a tree. The house
had large stone chimneys, and was roofed with spruce-bark.
The windows were imported, all but the casings.
One end was a regular logger's camp, for the boarders,
with the usual fir floor and log benches. Thus this house
was but a slight departure from the hollow tree, which
the bear still inhabits,&mdash;being a hollow made with trees
piled up, with a coating of bark like its original.

The cellar was a separate building, like an ice-house,
and it answered for a refrigerator at this season, our
moose meat being kept there. It was a potato hole with
a permanent roof. Each structure and institution here
140
was so primitive that you could at once refer it to its
source; but our buildings commonly suggest neither
their origin nor their purpose. There was a large, and
what farmers would call handsome, barn, part of whose
boards had been sawed by a whip-saw; and the saw-pit,
with its great pile of dust, remained before the house.
The long split shingles on a portion of the barn were laid
a foot to the weather, suggesting what kind of weather
they have there. Grant's barn at Caribou Lake was said
to be still larger, the biggest ox-nest in the woods, fifty
feet by a hundred. Think of a monster barn in that
primitive forest lifting its gray back above the tree-tops!
Man makes very much such a nest for his domestic
animals, of withered grass and fodder, as the squirrels
and many other wild creatures do for themselves.

There was also a blacksmith's shop, where plainly a
good deal of work was done. The oxen and horses used
in lumbering operations were shod, and all the iron-work
of sleds, etc., was repaired or made here. I saw
them load a batteau at the Moosehead Carry, the next
Tuesday, with about thirteen hundredweight of bar
iron for this shop. This reminded me how primitive
and honorable a trade was Vulcan's. I do not hear that
there was any carpenter or tailor among the gods. The
smith seems to have preceded these and every other
mechanic at Chesuncook as well as on Olympus, and
his family is the most widely dispersed, whether he be
christened John or Ansell.

Smith owned two miles down the lake by half a mile
in width. There were about one hundred acres cleared
here. He cut seventy tons of English hay this year on
141
this ground, and twenty more on another clearing, and
he uses it all himself in lumbering operations. The barn
was crowded with pressed hay, and a machine to press
it. There was a large garden full of roots,&mdash;turnips,
beets, carrots, potatoes, etc., all of great size. They said
that they were worth as much here as in New York. I
suggested some currants for sauce, especially as they had
no apple trees set out, and showed how easily they could
be obtained.

There was the usual long-handled axe of the primitive
woods by the door, three and a half feet long,&mdash;for my
new black-ash rule was in constant use,&mdash;and a large,
shaggy dog, whose nose, report said, was full of porcupine
quills. I can testify that he looked very sober. This
is the usual fortune of pioneer dogs, for they have to
face the brunt of the battle for their race, and act the
part of Arnold Winkelried without intending it. If he
should invite one of his town friends up this way, suggesting
moose meat and unlimited freedom, the latter
might pertinently inquire, "What is that sticking in
your nose?" When a generation or two have used up all
the enemies' darts, their successors lead a comparatively
easy life. We owe to our fathers analogous blessings.
Many old people receive pensions for no other reason, it
seems to me, but as a compensation for having lived a
long time ago. No doubt our town dogs still talk, in
a snuffling way, about the days that tried dogs' noses.
How they got a cat up there I do not know, for they are
as shy as my aunt about entering a canoe. I wondered
that she did not run up a tree on the way; but perhaps
she was bewildered by the very crowd of opportunities.
142

Twenty or thirty lumberers, Yankee and Canadian,
were coming and going,&mdash;Aleck among the rest,&mdash;and
from time to time an Indian touched here. In the
winter there are sometimes a hundred men lodged here
at once. The most interesting piece of news that circulated
among them appeared to be, that four horses
belonging to Smith, worth seven hundred dollars, had
passed by farther into the woods a week before.

The white pine tree was at the bottom or farther end
of all this. It is a war against the pines, the only real
Aroostook or Penobscot war. I have no doubt that they
lived pretty much the same sort of life in the Homeric
age, for men have always thought more of eating than
of fighting; then, as now, their minds ran chiefly on the
"hot bread and sweet cakes;" and the fur and lumber
trade is an old story to Asia and Europe. I doubt if men
ever made a trade of heroism. In the days of Achilles,
even, they delighted in big barns, and perchance in
pressed hay, and he who possessed the most valuable
team was the best fellow.

We had designed to go on at evening up the Caucomgomoc,
whose mouth was a mile or two distant, to the
lake of the same name, about ten miles off; but some
Indians of Joe's acquaintance, who were making canoes
on the Caucomgomoc, came over from that side, and
gave so poor an account of the moose-hunting, so many
had been killed there lately, that my companions concluded
not to go there. Joe spent this Sunday and the
night with his acquaintances. The lumberers told me
that there were many moose hereabouts, but no caribou
or deer. A man from Oldtown had killed ten or twelve
143
moose, within a year, so near the house that they heard
all his guns. His name may have been Hercules, for
aught I know, though I should rather have expected to
hear the rattling of his club; but, no doubt, he keeps pace
with the improvements of the age, and uses a Sharp's
rifle now; probably he gets all his armor made and repaired
at Smith's shop. One moose had been killed
and another shot at within sight of the house within
two years. I do not know whether Smith has yet got
a poet to look after the cattle, which, on account of the
early breaking up of the ice, are compelled to summer in
the woods, but I would suggest this office to such of my
acquaintances as love to write verses and go a-gunning.

After a dinner at which apple-sauce was the greatest
luxury to me, but our moose meat was oftenest called for
by the lumberers, I walked across the clearing into the
forest, southward, returning along the shore. For my
dessert, I helped myself to a large slice of the Chesuncook
woods, and took a hearty draught of its waters with
all my senses. The woods were as fresh and full of vegetable
life as a lichen in wet weather, and contained many
interesting plants; but unless they are of white pine,
they are treated with as little respect here as a mildew,
and in the other case they are only the more quickly cut
down. The shore was of coarse, flat, slate rocks, often
in slabs, with the surf beating on it. The rocks and
bleached drift-logs, extending some way into the shaggy
woods, showed a rise and fall of six or eight feet, caused
partly by the dam at the outlet. They said that in winter
the snow was three feet deep on a level here, and
sometimes four or five,&mdash;that the ice on the lake was
144
two feet thick, clear, and four feet including the snow-ice.
Ice had already formed in vessels.

We lodged here this Sunday night in a comfortable
bedroom, apparently the best one; and all that I noticed
unusual in the night&mdash;for I still kept taking notes,
like a spy in the camp&mdash;was the creaking of the thin
split boards, when any of our neighbors stirred.

Such were the first rude beginnings of a town. They
spoke of the practicability of a winter road to the Moosehead
Carry, which would not cost much, and would
connect them with steam and staging and all the busy
world. I almost doubted if the lake would be there,&mdash;the
self-same lake,&mdash;preserve its form and identity,
when the shores should be cleared and settled; as if
these lakes and streams which explorers report never
awaited the advent of the citizen.

The sight of one of these frontier houses, built of these
great logs, whose inhabitants have unflinchingly maintained
their ground many summers and winters in the
wilderness, reminds me of famous forts, like Ticonderoga
or Crown Point, which have sustained memorable
sieges. They are especially winter-quarters, and at this
season this one had a partially deserted look, as if the
siege were raised a little, the snowbanks being melted
from before it, and its garrison accordingly reduced.
I think of their daily food as rations,&mdash;it is called
"supplies;" a Bible and a greatcoat are munitions of
war, and a single man seen about the premises is a sentinel
on duty. You expect that he will require the countersign,
and will perchance take you for Ethan Allen, come to
demand the surrender of his fort in the name of the Continental
145
Congress. It is a sort of ranger service. Arnold's
expedition is a daily experience with these settlers.
They can prove that they were out at almost any time;
and I think that all the first generation of them deserve
a pension more than any that went to the Mexican war.

Early the next morning we started on our return up
the Penobscot, my companion wishing to go about
twenty-five miles above the Moosehead Carry to a camp
near the junction of the two forks, and look for moose
there. Our host allowed us something for the quarter of
the moose which we had brought, and which he was glad
to get. Two explorers from Chamberlain Lake started
at the same time that we did. Red flannel shirts should
be worn in the woods, if only for the fine contrast which
this color makes with the evergreens and the water.
Thus I thought when I saw the forms of the explorers
in their birch, poling up the rapids before us, far off
against the forest. It is the surveyor's color also, most
distinctly seen under all circumstances. We stopped to
dine at Ragmuff, as before. My companion it was who
wandered up the stream to look for moose this time,
while Joe went to sleep on the bank, so that we felt sure
of him; and I improved the opportunity to botanize and
bathe. Soon after starting again, while Joe was gone back
in the canoe for the frying-pan, which had been left, we
picked a couple of quarts of tree-cranberries for a sauce.

I was surprised by Joe's asking me how far it was to
the Moosehorn. He was pretty well acquainted with this
stream, but he had noticed that I was curious about distances,
and had several maps. He and Indians generally,
with whom I have talked, are not able to describe dimensions
146
or distances in our measures with any accuracy.
He could tell, perhaps, at what time we should arrive, but
not how far it was. We saw a few wood ducks, sheldrakes,
and black ducks, but they were not so numerous there
at that season as on our river at home. We scared the
same family of wood ducks before us, going and returning.
We also heard the note of one fish hawk, somewhat
like that of a pigeon woodpecker, and soon after saw him
perched near the top of a dead white pine against the
island where we had first camped, while a company of
peetweets were twittering and teetering about over the
carcass of a moose on a low sandy spit just beneath.
We drove the fish hawk from perch to perch, each time
eliciting a scream or whistle, for many miles before us.
Our course being up-stream, we were obliged to work
much harder than before, and had frequent use for
a pole. Sometimes all three of us paddled together,
standing up, small and heavily laden as the canoe was.
About six miles from Moosehead, we began to see the
mountains east of the north end of the lake, and at four
o'clock we reached the carry.

The Indians were still encamped here. There were
three, including the St. Francis Indian who had come
in the steamer with us. One of the others was called
Sabattis. Joe and the St. Francis Indian were plainly
clear Indian, the other two apparently mixed Indian and
white; but the difference was confined to their features
and complexion, for all that I could see. We here cooked
the tongue of the moose for supper,&mdash;having left the
nose, which is esteemed the choicest part, at Chesuncook,
boiling, it being a good deal of trouble to prepare
147
it. We also stewed our tree-cranberries (Viburnum
opulus), sweetening them with sugar. The lumberers
sometimes cook them with molasses. They were used in
Arnold's expedition. This sauce was very grateful to us
who had been confined to hard-bread, pork, and moose
meat, and, notwithstanding their seeds, we all three
pronounced them equal to the common cranberry; but
perhaps some allowance is to be made for our forest
appetites. It would be worth the while to cultivate them,
both for beauty and for food. I afterward saw them in
a garden in Bangor. Joe said that they were called
ebeemenar.

While we were getting supper, Joe commenced curing
the moose-hide, on which I had sat a good part of the
voyage, he having already cut most of the hair off with
his knife at the Caucomgomoc. He set up two stout
forked poles on the bank, seven or eight feet high, and
as much asunder east and west, and having cut slits
eight or ten inches long, and the same distance apart,
close to the edge, on the sides of the hide, he threaded
poles through them, and then, placing one of the poles
on the forked stakes, tied the other down tightly at the
bottom. The two ends also were tied with cedar bark,
their usual string, to the upright poles, through small
holes at short intervals. The hide, thus stretched, and
slanted a little to the north, to expose its flesh side to
the sun, measured, in the extreme, eight feet long by
six high. Where any flesh still adhered, Joe boldly
scored it with his knife to lay it open to the sun. It
now appeared somewhat spotted and injured by the
duck shot. You may see the old frames on which hides
148
have been stretched at many camping-places in these
woods.

For some reason or other, the going to the forks of the
Penobscot was given up, and we decided to stop here,
my companion intending to hunt down the stream at
night. The Indians invited us to lodge with them, but
my companion inclined to go to the log camp on the
carry. This camp was close and dirty, and had an ill
smell, and I preferred to accept the Indians' offer, if we
did not make a camp for ourselves; for, though they
were dirty, too, they were more in the open air, and were
much more agreeable, and even refined company, than
the lumberers. The most interesting question entertained
at the lumberers' camp was, which man could
"handle" any other on the carry; and, for the most part,
they possessed no qualities which you could not lay
hands on. So we went to the Indians' camp or wigwam.

It was rather windy, and therefore Joe concluded to
hunt after midnight, if the wind went down, which the
other Indians thought it would not do, because it was
from the south. The two mixed-bloods, however, went
off up the river for moose at dark, before we arrived at
their camp. This Indian camp was a slight, patched-up
affair, which had stood there several weeks, built
shed-fashion, open to the fire on the west. If the wind
changed, they could turn it round. It was formed by two
forked stakes and a cross-bar, with rafters slanted from
this to the ground. The covering was partly an old sail,
partly birch-bark, quite imperfect, but securely tied on,
and coming down to the ground on the sides. A large
log was rolled up at the back side for a headboard, and
149
two or three moose-hides were spread on the ground
with the hair up. Various articles of their wardrobe were
tucked around the sides and corners, or under the roof.
They were smoking moose meat on just such a crate as is
represented by With, in De Bry's "Collectio Peregrinationum,"
published in 1588, and which the natives of
Brazil called boucan (whence buccaneer), on which were
frequently shown pieces of human flesh drying along
with the rest. It was erected in front of the camp over
the usual large fire, in the form of an oblong square.
Two stout forked stakes, four or five feet apart and five
feet high, were driven into the ground at each end, and
then two poles ten feet long were stretched across over
the fire, and smaller ones laid transversely on these a foot
apart. On the last hung large, thin slices of moose meat
smoking and drying, a space being left open over the
centre of the fire. There was the whole heart, black as a
thirty-two pound ball, hanging at one corner. They said
that it took three or four days to cure this meat, and it
would keep a year or more. Refuse pieces lay about on
the ground in different stages of decay, and some pieces
also in the fire, half buried and sizzling in the ashes,
as black and dirty as an old shoe. These last I at first
thought were thrown away, but afterwards found that
they were being cooked. Also a tremendous rib-piece
was roasting before the fire, being impaled on an upright
stake forced in and out between the ribs. There
was a moose-hide stretched and curing on poles like ours,
and quite a pile of cured skins close by. They had killed
twenty-two moose within two months, but, as they
could use but very little of the meat, they left the carcases
150
on the ground. Altogether it was about as savage
a sight as was ever witnessed, and I was carried back at
once three hundred years. There were many torches of
birch-bark, shaped like straight tin horns, lying ready
for use on a stump outside.

For fear of dirt, we spread our blankets over their
hides, so as not to touch them anywhere. The St.
Francis Indian and Joe alone were there at first, and we
lay on our backs talking with them till midnight. They
were very sociable, and, when they did not talk with us,
kept up a steady chatting in their own language. We
heard a small bird just after dark, which, Joe said,
sang at a certain hour in the night,&mdash;at ten o'clock,
he believed. We also heard the hylodes and tree-toads,
and the lumberers singing in their camp a quarter of a
mile off. I told them that I had seen pictured in old
books pieces of human flesh drying on these crates;
whereupon they repeated some tradition about the
Mohawks eating human flesh, what parts they preferred,
etc., and also of a battle with the Mohawks near
Moosehead, in which many of the latter were killed; but
I found that they knew but little of the history of their
race, and could be entertained by stories about their
ancestors as readily as any way. At first I was nearly
roasted out, for I lay against one side of the camp,
and felt the heat reflected not only from the birch-bark
above, but from the side; and again I remembered the
sufferings of the Jesuit missionaries, and what extremes
of heat and cold the Indians were said to endure. I struggled
long between my desire to remain and talk with
them and my impulse to rush out and stretch myself on
151
the cool grass; and when I was about to take the last
step, Joe, hearing my murmurs, or else being uncomfortable
himself, got up and partially dispersed the fire.
I suppose that that is Indian manners,&mdash;to defend
yourself.

While lying there listening to the Indians, I amused
myself with trying to guess at their subject by their gestures,
or some proper name introduced. There can be
no more startling evidence of their being a distinct and
comparatively aboriginal race than to hear this unaltered
Indian language, which the white man cannot speak nor
understand. We may suspect change and deterioration
in almost every other particular but the language which
is so wholly unintelligible to us. It took me by surprise,
though I had found so many arrowheads, and convinced
me that the Indian was not the invention of historians
and poets. It was a purely wild and primitive American
sound, as much as the barking of a chickaree, and
I could not understand a syllable of it; but Paugus,
had he been there, would have understood it. These
Abenakis gossiped, laughed, and jested, in the language
in which Eliot's Indian Bible is written, the language
which has been spoken in New England who shall say
how long? These were the sounds that issued from the
wigwams of this country before Columbus was born;
they have not yet died away; and, with remarkably few
exceptions, the language of their forefathers is still
copious enough for them. I felt that I stood, or rather
lay, as near to the primitive man of America, that night,
as any of its discoverers ever did.

In the midst of their conversation, Joe suddenly
152
appealed to me to know how long Moosehead Lake
was.

Meanwhile, as we lay there, Joe was making and
trying his horn, to be ready for hunting after midnight.
The St. Francis Indian also amused himself with sounding
it, or rather calling through it; for the sound is made
with the voice, and not by blowing through the horn.
The latter appeared to be a speculator in moose-hides.
He bought my companion's for two dollars and a quarter,
green. Joe said that it was worth two and a half at
Oldtown. Its chief use is for moccasins. One or two of
these Indians wore them. I was told that, by a recent
law of Maine, foreigners are not allowed to kill moose
there at any season; white Americans can kill them only
at a particular season, but the Indians of Maine at all
seasons. The St. Francis Indian accordingly asked my
companion for a wighiggin, or bill, to show, since he was
a foreigner. He lived near Sorel. I found that he could
write his name very well, Tahmunt Swasen. One Ellis,
an old white man of Guilford, a town through which
we passed, not far from the south end of Moosehead,
was the most celebrated moose-hunter of those parts.
Indians and whites spoke with equal respect of him.
Tahmunt said that there were more moose here than
in the Adirondack country in New York, where he had
hunted; that three years before there were a great many
about, and there were a great many now in the woods,
but they did not come out to the water. It was of no use
to hunt them at midnight,&mdash;they would not come out
then. I asked Sabattis, after he came home, if the moose
never attacked him. He answered that you must not
153
fire many times, so as to mad him. "I fire once and hit
him in the right place, and in the morning I find him.
He won't go far. But if you keep firing, you mad him.
I fired once five bullets, every one through the heart,
and he did not mind 'em at all; it only made him more
mad." I asked him if they did not hunt them with dogs.
He said that they did so in winter, but never in the summer,
for then it was of no use; they would run right off
straight and swiftly a hundred miles.

Another Indian said that the moose, once scared,
would run all day. A dog will hang to their lips, and be
carried along till he is swung against a tree and drops
off. They cannot run on a "glaze," though they can
run in snow four feet deep; but the caribou can run on
ice. They commonly find two or three moose together.
They cover themselves with water, all but their noses,
to escape flies. He had the horns of what he called "the
black moose that goes in low lands." These spread three
or four feet. The "red moose" was another kind,
"running on mountains," and had horns which spread
six feet. Such were his distinctions. Both can move their
horns. The broad flat blades are covered with hair,
and are so soft, when the animal is alive, that you can
run a knife through them. They regard it as a good or
bad sign, if the horns turn this way or that. His caribou
horns had been gnawed by mice in his wigwam, but he
thought that the horns neither of the moose nor of the
caribou were ever gnawed while the creature was alive,
as some have asserted. An Indian, whom I met after this
at Oldtown, who had carried about a bear and other
animals of Maine to exhibit, told me that thirty years
154
ago there were not so many moose in Maine as now;
also, that the moose were very easily tamed, and would
come back when once fed, and so would deer, but not
caribou. The Indians of this neighborhood are about
as familiar with the moose as we are with the ox, having
associated with them for so many generations. Father
Rasles, in his Dictionary of the Abenaki Language,
gives not only a word for the male moose (aianbé), and
another for the female (hèrar), but for the bone which is
in the middle of the heart of the moose (!), and for his
left hind leg.

There were none of the small deer up there; they are
more common about the settlements. One ran into the
city of Bangor two years before, and jumped through
a window of costly plate glass, and then into a mirror,
where it thought it recognized one of its kind, and out
again, and so on, leaping over the heads of the crowd,
until it was captured. This the inhabitants speak of
as the deer that went a-shopping. The last-mentioned
Indian spoke of the lunxus or Indian devil (which I take
to be the cougar, and not the Gulo luscus), as the only
animal in Maine which man need fear; it would follow a
man, and did not mind a fire. He also said that beavers
were getting to be pretty numerous again, where we
went, but their skins brought so little now that it was not
profitable to hunt them.

I had put the ears of our moose, which were ten inches
long, to dry along with the moose meat over the fire,
wishing to preserve them; but Sabattis told me that I
must skin and cure them, else the hair would all come
off. He observed that they made tobacco pouches of the
155
skins of their ears, putting the two together inside to
inside. I asked him how he got fire; and he produced
a little cylindrical box of friction matches. He also had
flints and steel, and some punk, which was not dry; I
think it was from the yellow birch. "But suppose you
upset, and all these and your powder get wet." "Then,"
said he, "we wait till we get to where there is some
fire." I produced from my pocket a little vial, containing
matches, stoppled water-tight, and told him, that,
though we were upset, we should still have some dry
matches; at which he stared without saying a word.

We lay awake thus a long while talking, and they
gave us the meaning of many Indian names of lakes and
streams in the vicinity,&mdash;especially Tahmunt. I asked
the Indian name of Moosehead Lake. Joe answered
Sebamook; Tahmunt pronounced it Sebemook. When I
asked what it meant, they answered, Moosehead Lake.
At length, getting my meaning, they alternately repeated
the word over to themselves, as a philologist might,&mdash;Sebamook,&mdash;Sebamook,&mdash;now
and then comparing
notes in Indian; for there was a slight difference in their
dialects; and finally Tahmunt said, "Ugh! I know,"&mdash;and
he rose up partly on the moose-hide,&mdash;"like as
here is a place, and there is a place," pointing to different
parts of the hide, "and you take water from there and
fill this, and it stays here; that is Sebamook." I understood
him to mean that it was a reservoir of water which
did not run away, the river coming in on one side and
passing out again near the same place, leaving a permanent
bay. Another Indian said, that it meant Large
Bay Lake, and that Sebago and Sebec, the names of
156
other lakes, were kindred words, meaning large open
water. Joe said that Seboois meant Little River. I
observed their inability, often described, to convey an
abstract idea. Having got the idea, though indistinctly,
they groped about in vain for words with which to
express it. Tahmunt thought that the whites called it
Moosehead Lake, because Mount Kineo, which commands
it, is shaped like a moose's head, and that Moose
River was so called "because the mountain points right
across the lake to its mouth." John Josselyn, writing
about 1673, says, "Twelve miles from Casco Bay, and
passable for men and horses, is a lake, called by the Indians
Sebug. On the brink thereof, at one end, is the
famous rock, shaped like a moose deer or helk, diaphanous,
and called the Moose Rock." He appears to have
confounded Sebamook with Sebago, which is nearer,
but has no "diaphanous" rock on its shore.

I give more of their definitions, for what they are
worth,&mdash;partly because they differ sometimes from the
commonly received ones. They never analyzed these
words before. After long deliberation and repeating of
the word,&mdash;for it gave much trouble,&mdash;Tahmunt said
that Chesuncook meant a place where many streams
emptied in (?), and he enumerated them,&mdash;Penobscot,
Umbazookskus, Cusabesex, Red Brook, etc. "Caucomgomoc,&mdash;what
does that mean?" "What are those
large white birds?" he asked. "Gulls," said I. "Ugh!
Gull Lake." Pammadumcook, Joe thought, meant the
Lake with Gravelly Bottom or Bed. Kenduskeag,
Tahmunt concluded at last, after asking if birches went
up it,&mdash;for he said that he was not much acquainted
157
with it,&mdash;meant something like this: "You go up
Penobscot till you come to Kenduskeag, and you go by,
you don't turn up there. That is Kenduskeag." (?)
Another Indian, however, who knew the river better,
told us afterward that it meant Little Eel River. Mattawamkeag
was a place where two rivers meet. (?)
Penobscot was Rocky River. One writer says that this
was "originally the name of only a section of the main
channel, from the head of the tide-water to a short distance
above Oldtown."

A very intelligent Indian, whom we afterward met,
son-in-law of Neptune, gave us also these other definitions:
Umbazookskus, Meadow Stream; Millinoket,
Place of Islands; Aboljacarmegus, Smooth-Ledge Falls
(and Deadwater); Aboljacarmeguscook, the stream
emptying in (the last was the word he gave when I
asked about Aboljacknagesic, which he did not recognize);
Mattahumkeag, Sand-Creek Pond; Piscataquis,
Branch of a River.

I asked our hosts what Musketaquid, the Indian name
of Concord, Massachusetts, meant; but they changed it
to Musketicook, and repeated that, and Tahmunt said
that it meant Dead Stream, which is probably true.
Cook appears to mean stream, and perhaps quid signifies
the place or ground. When I asked the meaning
of the names of two of our hills, they answered that they
were another language. As Tahmunt said that he traded
at Quebec, my companion inquired the meaning of the
word Quebec, about which there has been so much
question. He did not know, but began to conjecture.
He asked what those great ships were called that carried
158
soldiers. "Men-of-war," we answered. "Well," he said,
"when the English ships came up the river, they could
not go any farther, it was so narrow there; they must go
back,&mdash;go-back,&mdash;that's Que-bec." I mention this
to show the value of his authority in the other cases.

Late at night the other two Indians came home from
moose-hunting, not having been successful, aroused the
fire again, lighted their pipes, smoked awhile, took
something strong to drink, and ate some moose meat,
and, finding what room they could, lay down on the
moose-hides; and thus we passed the night, two white
men and four Indians, side by side.

When I awoke in the morning the weather was drizzling.
One of the Indians was lying outside, rolled in
his blanket, on the opposite side of the fire, for want of
room. Joe had neglected to awake my companion, and
he had done no hunting that night. Tahmunt was making
a cross-bar for his canoe with a singularly shaped
knife, such as I have since seen other Indians using.
The blade was thin, about three quarters of an inch
wide, and eight or nine inches long, but curved out of
its plane into a hook, which he said made it more convenient
to shave with. As the Indians very far north and
northwest use the same kind of knife, I suspect that
it was made according to an aboriginal pattern, though
some white artisans may use a similar one. The Indians
baked a loaf of flour bread in a spider on its edge before
the fire for their breakfast; and while my companion
was making tea, I caught a dozen sizable fishes in the
Penobscot, two kinds of sucker and one trout. After we
had breakfasted by ourselves, one of our bed-fellows,
159
who had also breakfasted, came along, and, being
invited, took a cup of tea, and finally, taking up the
common platter, licked it clean. But he was nothing to
a white fellow, a lumberer, who was continually stuffing
himself with the Indians' moose meat, and was the butt
of his companions accordingly. He seems to have
thought that it was a feast "to eat all." It is commonly
said that the white man finally surpasses the Indian on
his own ground, and it was proved true in this case. I
cannot swear to his employment during the hours of
darkness, but I saw him at it again as soon as it was
light, though he came a quarter of a mile to his work.

The rain prevented our continuing any longer in the
woods; so, giving some of our provisions and utensils
to the Indians, we took leave of them. This being the
steamer's day, I set out for the lake at once.

I walked over the carry alone and waited at the head
of the lake. An eagle, or some other large bird, flew
screaming away from its perch by the shore at my
approach. For an hour after I reached the shore there
was not a human being to be seen, and I had all that
wide prospect to myself. I thought that I heard the
sound of the steamer before she came in sight on the
open lake. I noticed at the landing, when the steamer
came in, one of our bed-fellows, who had been a-moose-hunting
the night before, now very sprucely dressed in
a clean white shirt and fine black pants, a true Indian
dandy, who had evidently come over the carry to show
himself to any arrivers on the north shore of Moosehead
Lake, just as New York dandies take a turn up Broadway
and stand on the steps of a hotel.
160

Midway the lake we took on board two manly-looking
middle-aged men, with their batteau, who had been exploring
for six weeks as far as the Canada line, and had
let their beards grow. They had the skin of a beaver,
which they had recently caught, stretched on an oval
hoop, though the fur was not good at that season. I
talked with one of them, telling him that I had come
all this distance partly to see where the white pine, the
Eastern stuff of which our houses are built, grew, but
that on this and a previous excursion into another part
of Maine I had found it a scarce tree; and I asked him
where I must look for it. With a smile, he answered
that he could hardly tell me. However, he said that he
had found enough to employ two teams the next winter
in a place where there was thought to be none left.
What was considered a "tip-top" tree now was not
looked at twenty years ago, when he first went into the
business; but they succeeded very well now with what
was considered quite inferior timber then. The explorer
used to cut into a tree higher and higher up, to see if it
was false-hearted, and if there was a rotten heart as big
as his arm, he let it alone; but now they cut such a tree
and sawed it all around the rot, and it made the very
best of boards, for in such a case they were never shaky.

One connected with lumbering operations at Bangor
told me that the largest pine belonging to his firm, cut
the previous winter, "scaled" in the woods four thousand
five hundred feet, and was worth ninety dollars in
the log at the Bangor boom in Oldtown. They cut a
road three and a half miles long for this tree alone. He
thought that the principal locality for the white pine
161
that came down the Penobscot now was at the head
of the East Branch and the Allegash, about Webster
Stream and Eagle and Chamberlain lakes. Much timber
has been stolen from the public lands. (Pray, what kind
of forest-warden is the Public itself?) I heard of one
man who, having discovered some particularly fine trees
just within the boundaries of the public lands, and not
daring to employ an accomplice, cut them down, and by
means of block and tackle, without cattle, tumbled them
into a stream, and so succeeded in getting off with them
without the least assistance. Surely, stealing pine trees
in this way is not so mean as robbing hen-roosts.

We reached Monson that night, and the next day rode
to Bangor, all the way in the rain again, varying our
route a little. Some of the taverns on this road, which
were particularly dirty, were plainly in a transition state
from the camp to the house.

The next forenoon we went to Oldtown. One slender
old Indian on the Oldtown shore, who recognized my
companion, was full of mirth and gestures, like a Frenchman.
A Catholic priest crossed to the island in the same
batteau with us. The Indian houses are framed, mostly
of one story, and in rows one behind another, at the
south end of the island, with a few scattered ones. I
counted about forty, not including the church and what
my companion called the council-house. The last,
which I suppose is their town-house, was regularly
framed and shingled like the rest. There were several
of two stories, quite neat, with front yards inclosed, and
one at least had green blinds. Here and there were
162
moose-hides stretched and drying about them. There
were no cart-paths, nor tracks of horses, but footpaths;
very little land cultivated, but an abundance of weeds,
indigenous and naturalized; more introduced weeds
than useful vegetables, as the Indian is said to cultivate
the vices rather than the virtues of the white man. Yet
this village was cleaner than I expected, far cleaner than
such Irish villages as I have seen. The children were not
particularly ragged nor dirty. The little boys met us
with bow in hand and arrow on string, and cried, "Put
up a cent." Verily, the Indian has but a feeble hold
on his bow now; but the curiosity of the white man is
insatiable, and from the first he has been eager to witness
this forest accomplishment. That elastic piece of wood
with its feathered dart, so sure to be unstrung by contact
with civilization, will serve for the type, the coat-of-arms
of the savage. Alas for the Hunter Race! the white
man has driven off their game, and substituted a cent in
its place. I saw an Indian woman washing at the water's
edge. She stood on a rock, and, after dipping the clothes
in the stream, laid them on the rock, and beat them with
a short club. In the graveyard, which was crowded with
graves, and overrun with weeds, I noticed an inscription
in Indian, painted on a wooden grave-board. There was
a large wooden cross on the island.

Since my companion knew him, we called on Governor
Neptune, who lived in a little "ten-footer," one
of the humblest of them all. Personalities are allowable
in speaking of public men, therefore I will give the particulars
of our visit. He was abed. When we entered
the room, which was one half of the house, he was sitting
163
on the side of the bed. There was a clock hanging in one
corner. He had on a black frock coat, and black pants,
much worn, white cotton shirt, socks, a red silk handkerchief
about his neck, and a straw hat. His black hair
was only slightly grayed. He had very broad cheeks, and
his features were decidedly and refreshingly different
from those of any of the upstart Native American party
whom I have seen. He was no darker than many old
white men. He told me that he was eighty-nine; but he
was going a-moose-hunting that fall, as he had been the
previous one. Probably his companions did the hunting.
We saw various squaws dodging about. One sat on the
bed by his side and helped him out with his stories. They
were remarkably corpulent, with smooth, round faces,
apparently full of good-humor. Certainly our much-abused
climate had not dried up their adipose substance.
While we were there,&mdash;for we stayed a good while,&mdash;one
went over to Oldtown, returned and cut out a dress,
which she had bought, on another bed in the room. The
Governor said that "he could remember when the moose
were much larger; that they did not use to be in the
woods, but came out of the water, as all deer did.
Moose was whale once. Away down Merrimack way,
a whale came ashore in a shallow bay. Sea went out and
left him, and he came up on land a moose. What made
them know he was a whale was, that at first, before he
began to run in bushes, he had no bowels inside, but"&mdash;and
then the squaw who sat on the bed by his side, as
the Governor's aid, and had been putting in a word
now and then and confirming the story, asked me what
we called that soft thing we find along the seashore.
164
"Jelly-fish," I suggested. "Yes," said he, "no bowels,
but jelly-fish."

There may be some truth in what he said about the
moose growing larger formerly; for the quaint John
Josselyn, a physician who spent many years in this very
district of Maine in the seventeenth century, says that
the tips of their horns "are sometimes found to be two
fathoms asunder,"&mdash;and he is particular to tell us that
a fathom is six feet,&mdash;"and [they are] in height, from
the toe of the fore foot to the pitch of the shoulder,
twelve foot, both which hath been taken by some of
my sceptique readers to be monstrous lies;" and he
adds, "There are certain transcendentia in every creature,
which are the indelible character of God, and
which discover God." This is a greater dilemma to be
caught in than is presented by the cranium of the young
Bechuana ox, apparently another of the transcendentia,
in the collection of Thomas Steel, Upper Brook Street,
London, whose "entire length of horn, from tip to tip,
along the curve, is 13 ft. 5 in.; distance (straight) between
the tips of the horns, 8 ft. 8½ in." However, the
size both of the moose and the cougar, as I have found,
is generally rather underrated than overrated, and I
should be inclined to add to the popular estimate a part
of what I subtracted from Josselyn's.

But we talked mostly with the Governor's son-in-law,
a very sensible Indian; and the Governor, being so old
and deaf, permitted himself to be ignored, while we
asked questions about him. The former said that there
were two political parties among them,&mdash;one in favor
of schools, and the other opposed to them, or rather
165
they did not wish to resist the priest, who was opposed to
them. The first had just prevailed at the election and
sent their man to the legislature. Neptune and Aitteon
and he himself were in favor of schools. He said, "If
Indians got learning, they would keep their money."
When we asked where Joe's father, Aitteon, was, he
knew that he must be at Lincoln, though he was about
going a-moose-hunting, for a messenger had just gone to
him there to get his signature to some papers. I asked
Neptune if they had any of the old breed of dogs yet.
He answered, "Yes." "But that," said I, pointing to
one that had just come in, "is a Yankee dog." He
assented. I said that he did not look like a good one.
"Oh, yes!" he said, and he told, with much gusto, how,
the year before, he had caught and held by the throat a
wolf. A very small black puppy rushed into the room
and made at the Governor's feet, as he sat in his stockings
with his legs dangling from the bedside. The Governor
rubbed his hands and dared him to come on,
entering into the sport with spirit. Nothing more that
was significant transpired, to my knowledge, during this
interview. This was the first time that I ever called on a
governor, but, as I did not ask for an office, I can speak
of it with the more freedom.

An Indian who was making canoes behind a house,
looking up pleasantly from his work,&mdash;for he knew my
companion,&mdash;said that his name was Old John Pennyweight.
I had heard of him long before, and I inquired
after one of his contemporaries, Joe Four-pence-ha'penny;
but alas! he no longer circulates. I made a
faithful study of canoe-building, and I thought that I
166
should like to serve an apprenticeship at that trade for
one season, going into the woods for bark with my
"boss," making the canoe there, and returning in it at
last.

While the batteau was coming over to take us off, I
picked up some fragments of arrowheads on the shore,
and one broken stone chisel, which were greater novelties
to the Indians than to me. After this, on Old Fort
Hill, at the bend of the Penobscot, three miles above
Bangor, looking for the site of an Indian town which
some think stood thereabouts, I found more arrowheads,
and two little dark and crumbling fragments of
Indian earthenware, in the ashes of their fires. The
Indians on the island appeared to live quite happily and
to be well treated by the inhabitants of Oldtown.

We visited Veazie's mills, just below the island, where
were sixteen sets of saws,&mdash;some gang saws, sixteen
in a gang, not to mention circular saws. On one side,
they were hauling the logs up an inclined plane by water-power;
on the other, passing out the boards, planks, and
sawed timber, and forming them into rafts. The trees
were literally drawn and quartered there. In forming
the rafts, they use the lower three feet of hard-wood
saplings, which have a crooked and knobbed butt-end,
for bolts, passing them up through holes bored in the
corners and sides of the rafts, and keying them. In
another apartment they were making fence-slats, such
as stand all over New England, out of odds and ends;
and it may be that I saw where the picket-fence behind
which I dwell at home came from. I was surprised to
find a boy collecting the long edgings of boards as fast as
167
cut off, and thrusting them down a hopper, where they
were ground up beneath the mill, that they might be
out of the way; otherwise they accumulate in vast piles
by the side of the building, increasing the danger from
fire, or, floating off, they obstruct the river. This was
not only a sawmill, but a gristmill, then. The inhabitants
of Oldtown, Stillwater, and Bangor cannot suffer
for want of kindling stuff, surely. Some get their living
exclusively by picking up the driftwood and selling it
by the cord in the winter. In one place I saw where an
Irishman, who keeps a team and a man for the purpose,
had covered the shore for a long distance with regular
piles, and I was told that he had sold twelve hundred
dollars' worth in a year. Another, who lived by the
shore, told me that he got all the material of his outbuildings
and fences from the river; and in that neighborhood
I perceived that this refuse wood was frequently
used instead of sand to fill hollows with, being
apparently cheaper than dirt.

I got my first clear view of Ktaadn, on this excursion,
from a hill about two miles northwest of Bangor, whither
I went for this purpose. After this I was ready to return
to Massachusetts.

Humboldt has written an interesting chapter on the
primitive forest, but no one has yet described for me
the difference between that wild forest which once
occupied our oldest townships, and the tame one which
I find there to-day. It is a difference which would be
worth attending to. The civilized man not only clears
the land permanently to a great extent, and cultivates
168
open fields, but he tames and cultivates to a certain
extent the forest itself. By his mere presence, almost,
he changes the nature of the trees as no other creature
does. The sun and air, and perhaps fire, have been
introduced, and grain raised where it stands. It has lost
its wild, damp, and shaggy look; the countless fallen
and decaying trees are gone, and consequently that
thick coat of moss which lived on them is gone too. The
earth is comparatively bare and smooth and dry. The
most primitive places left with us are the swamps, where
the spruce still grows shaggy with usnea. The surface
of the ground in the Maine woods is everywhere spongy
and saturated with moisture. I noticed that the plants
which cover the forest floor there are such as are commonly
confined to swamps with us,&mdash;the Clintonia
borealis, orchises, creeping snowberry, and others; and
the prevailing aster there is the Aster acuminatus, which
with us grows in damp and shady woods. The asters
cordifolius and macrophyllus also are common, asters
of little or no color, and sometimes without petals. I
saw no soft, spreading, second-growth white pines, with
smooth bark, acknowledging the presence of the woodchopper,
but even the young white pines were all tall
and slender rough-barked trees.

Those Maine woods differ essentially from ours.
There you are never reminded that the wilderness which
you are threading is, after all, some villager's familiar
wood-lot, some widow's thirds, from which her ancestors
have sledded fuel for generations, minutely described in
some old deed which is recorded, of which the owner
has got a plan, too, and old bound-marks may be found
169
every forty rods, if you will search. 'Tis true, the map
may inform you that you stand on land granted by the
State to some academy, or on Bingham's purchase; but
these names do not impose on you, for you see nothing to
remind you of the academy or of Bingham. What were
the "forests" of England to these? One writer relates
of the Isle of Wight, that in Charles the Second's time
"there were woods in the island so complete and extensive,
that it is said a squirrel might have traveled in
several parts many leagues together on the top of the
trees." If it were not for the rivers (and he might go
round their heads), a squirrel could here travel thus the
whole breadth of the country.

We have as yet had no adequate account of a primitive
pine forest. I have noticed that in a physical atlas lately
published in Massachusetts, and used in our schools,
the "wood land" of North America is limited almost
solely to the valleys of the Ohio and some of the Great
Lakes, and the great pine forests of the globe are not
represented. In our vicinity, for instance, New Brunswick
and Maine are exhibited as bare as Greenland.
It may be that the children of Greenville, at the foot of
Moosehead Lake, who surely are not likely to be scared
by an owl, are referred to the valley of the Ohio to get
an idea of a forest; but they would not know what to
do with their moose, bear, caribou, beaver, etc., there.
Shall we leave it to an Englishman to inform us, that
"in North America, both in the United States and Canada,
are the most extensive pine forests in the world"?
The greater part of New Brunswick, the northern half of
Maine, and adjacent parts of Canada, not to mention the
170
northeastern part of New York and other tracts farther
off, are still covered with an almost unbroken pine forest.

But Maine, perhaps, will soon be where Massachusetts
is. A good part of her territory is already as bare
and commonplace as much of our neighborhood, and
her villages generally are not so well shaded as ours.
We seem to think that the earth must go through the
ordeal of sheep-pasturage before it is habitable by man.
Consider Nahant, the resort of all the fashion of Boston,&mdash;which
peninsula I saw but indistinctly in the twilight,
when I steamed by it, and thought that it was unchanged
since the discovery. John Smith described it in 1614 as
"the Mattahunts, two pleasant isles of groves, gardens,
and cornfields;" and others tell us that it was once well
wooded, and even furnished timber to build the wharves
of Boston. Now it is difficult to make a tree grow there,
and the visitor comes away with a vision of Mr. Tudor's
ugly fences, a rod high, designed to protect a few pear
shrubs. And what are we coming to in our Middlesex
towns? A bald, staring town-house, or meeting-house,
and a bare liberty-pole, as leafless as it is fruitless, for
all I can see. We shall be obliged to import the timber
for the last, hereafter, or splice such sticks as we have.
And our ideas of liberty are equally mean with these.
The very willow-rows lopped every three years for fuel
or powder, and every sizable pine and oak, or other
forest tree, cut down within the memory of man! As if
individual speculators were to be allowed to export the
clouds out of the sky, or the stars out of the firmament,
one by one. We shall be reduced to gnaw the very crust
of the earth for nutriment.
171

They have even descended to smaller game. They
have lately, as I hear, invented a machine for chopping
up huckleberry bushes fine, and so converting them into
fuel!&mdash;bushes which, for fruit alone, are worth all the
pear trees in the country many times over. (I can give
you a list of the three best kinds, if you want it.) At
this rate, we shall all be obliged to let our beards grow
at least, if only to hide the nakedness of the land and
make a sylvan appearance. The farmer sometimes talks
of "brushing up," simply as if bare ground looked better
than clothed ground, than that which wears its natural
vesture,&mdash;as if the wild hedges, which, perhaps, are
more to his children than his whole farm beside, were
dirt. I know of one who deserves to be called the Tree-hater,
and, perhaps, to leave this for a new patronymic
to his children. You would think that he had been
warned by an oracle that he would be killed by the fall
of a tree, and so was resolved to anticipate them. The
journalists think that they cannot say too much in favor
of such "improvements" in husbandry; it is a safe
theme, like piety; but as for the beauty of one of these
"model farms," I would as lief see a patent churn and
a man turning it. They are, commonly, places merely
where somebody is making money, it may be counterfeiting.
The virtue of making two blades of grass grow
where only one grew before does not begin to be superhuman.

Nevertheless, it was a relief to get back to our smooth
but still varied landscape. For a permanent residence,
it seemed to me that there could be no comparison
between this and the wilderness, necessary as the latter
172
is for a resource and a background, the raw material of
all our civilization. The wilderness is simple, almost to
barrenness. The partially cultivated country it is which
chiefly has inspired, and will continue to inspire, the
strains of poets, such as compose the mass of any literature.
Our woods are sylvan, and their inhabitants woodmen
and rustics; that is selvaggia, and the inhabitants
are salvages. A civilized man, using the word in the
ordinary sense, with his ideas and associations, must at
length pine there, like a cultivated plant, which clasps
its fibres about a crude and undissolved mass of peat.
At the extreme north, the voyagers are obliged to dance
and act plays for employment. Perhaps our own woods
and fields,&mdash;in the best wooded towns, where we need
not quarrel about the huckleberries,&mdash;with the primitive
swamps scattered here and there in their midst, but
not prevailing over them, are the perfection of parks and
groves, gardens, arbors, paths, vistas, and landscapes.
They are the natural consequence of what art and refinement
we as a people have,&mdash;the common which each
village possesses, its true paradise, in comparison with
which all elaborately and willfully wealth-constructed
parks and gardens are paltry imitations. Or, I would
rather say, such were our groves twenty years ago. The
poet's, commonly, is not a logger's path, but a woodman's.
The logger and pioneer have preceded him, like
John the Baptist; eaten the wild honey, it may be, but
the locusts also; banished decaying wood and the spongy
mosses which feed on it, and built hearths and humanized
Nature for him.

But there are spirits of a yet more liberal culture, to
173
whom no simplicity is barren. There are not only stately
pines, but fragile flowers, like the orchises, commonly
described as too delicate for cultivation, which derive
their nutriment from the crudest mass of peat. These
remind us, that, not only for strength, but for beauty,
the poet must, from time to time, travel the logger's
path and the Indian's trail, to drink at some new and
more bracing fountain of the Muses, far in the recesses
of the wilderness.

The kings of England formerly had their forests "to
hold the king's game," for sport or food, sometimes
destroying villages to create or extend them; and I
think that they were impelled by a true instinct. Why
should not we, who have renounced the king's authority,
have our national preserves, where no villages need be
destroyed, in which the bear and panther, and some
even of the hunter race, may still exist, and not be
"civilized off the face of the earth,"&mdash;our forests, not
to hold the king's game merely, but to hold and preserve
the king himself also, the lord of creation,&mdash;not
for idle sport or food, but for inspiration and our own
true recreation? or shall we, like the villains, grub them
all up, poaching on our own national domains?
174

THE ALLEGASH AND EAST BRANCH

I started on my third excursion to the Maine woods
Monday, July 20, 1857, with one companion, arriving
at Bangor the next day at noon. We had hardly left the
steamer, when we passed Molly Molasses in the street.
As long as she lives, the Penobscots may be considered
extant as a tribe. The succeeding morning, a relative of
mine, who is well acquainted with the Penobscot Indians,
and who had been my companion in my two previous
excursions into the Maine woods, took me in his wagon
to Oldtown, to assist me in obtaining an Indian for this
expedition. We were ferried across to the Indian Island
in a batteau. The ferryman's boy had got the key to it,
but the father, who was a blacksmith, after a little hesitation
cut the chain with a cold-chisel on the rock. He
told me that the Indians were nearly all gone to the seaboard
and to Massachusetts, partly on account of the
smallpox&mdash;of which they are very much afraid&mdash;having
broken out in Oldtown, and it was doubtful whether
we should find a suitable one at home. The old chief
Neptune, however, was there still. The first man we saw
on the island was an Indian named Joseph Polis, whom
my relative had known from a boy, and now addressed
familiarly as "Joe." He was dressing a deer-skin in his
yard. The skin was spread over a slanting log, and he
was scraping it with a stick held by both hands. He was
stoutly built, perhaps a little above the middle height,
with a broad face, and, as others said, perfect Indian
175
features and complexion. His house was a two-story
white one, with blinds, the best-looking that I noticed
there, and as good as an average one on a New England
village street. It was surrounded by a garden and fruit-trees,
single cornstalks standing thinly amid the beans.
We asked him if he knew any good Indian who would
like to go into the woods with us, that is, to the Allegash
Lakes, by way of Moosehead, and return by the East
Branch of the Penobscot, or vary from this as we pleased.
To which he answered, out of that strange remoteness
in which the Indian ever dwells to the white man, "Me
like to go myself; me wants to get some moose;" and
kept on scraping the skin. His brother had been into the
woods with my relative only a year or two before, and
the Indian now inquired what the latter had done to
him, that he did not come back, for he had not seen nor
heard from him since.

At length we got round to the more interesting topic
again. The ferryman had told us that all the best
Indians were gone except Polis, who was one of the
aristocracy. He to be sure would be the best man we
could have, but if he went at all would want a great
price; so we did not expect to get him. Polis asked at
first two dollars a day, but agreed to go for a dollar and
a half, and fifty cents a week for his canoe. He would
come to Bangor with his canoe by the seven o'clock train
that evening,&mdash;we might depend on him. We thought
ourselves lucky to secure the services of this man, who
was known to be particularly steady and trustworthy.

I spent the afternoon with my companion, who had
remained in Bangor, in preparing for our expedition,
176
purchasing provisions, hard-bread, pork, coffee, sugar,
etc., and some india-rubber clothing.

We had at first thought of exploring the St. John from
its source to its mouth, or else to go up the Penobscot
by its East Branch to the lakes of the St. John, and
return by way of Chesuncook and Moosehead. We had
finally inclined to the last route, only reversing the order
of it, going by way of Moosehead, and returning by the
Penobscot, otherwise it would have been all the way upstream
and taken twice as long.

At evening the Indian arrived in the cars, and I led
the way while he followed me three quarters of a mile to
my friend's house, with the canoe on his head. I did not
know the exact route myself, but steered by the lay of
the land, as I do in Boston, and I tried to enter into
conversation with him, but as he was puffing under the
weight of his canoe, not having the usual apparatus for
carrying it, but, above all, was an Indian, I might as
well have been thumping on the bottom of his birch the
while. In answer to the various observations which I
made by way of breaking the ice, he only grunted vaguely
from beneath his canoe once or twice, so that I knew he
was there.

Early the next morning (July 23) the stage called for
us, the Indian having breakfasted with us, and already
placed the baggage in the canoe to see how it would go.
My companion and I had each a large knapsack as full
as it would hold, and we had two large india-rubber
bags which held our provision and utensils. As for the
Indian, all the baggage he had, beside his axe and gun,
was a blanket, which he brought loose in his hand. However,
177
he had laid in a store of tobacco and a new pipe for
the excursion. The canoe was securely lashed diagonally
across the top of the stage, with bits of carpet tucked
under the edge to prevent its chafing. The very accommodating
driver appeared as much accustomed to carrying
canoes in this way as bandboxes.

At the Bangor House we took in four men bound on a
hunting excursion, one of the men going as cook. They
had a dog, a middling-sized brindled cur, which ran
by the side of the stage, his master showing his head
and whistling from time to time; but after we had gone
about three miles the dog was suddenly missing, and two
of the party went back for him, while the stage, which
was full of passengers, waited. I suggested that he had
taken the back track for the Bangor House. At length
one man came back, while the other kept on. This
whole party of hunters declared their intention to stop
till the dog was found; but the very obliging driver was
ready to wait a spell longer. He was evidently unwilling
to lose so many passengers, who would have taken a
private conveyance, or perhaps the other line of stages,
the next day. Such progress did we make, with a journey
of over sixty miles to be accomplished that day, and a
rain-storm just setting in. We discussed the subject of
dogs and their instincts till it was threadbare, while we
waited there, and the scenery of the suburbs of Bangor
is still distinctly impressed on my memory. After full
half an hour the man returned, leading the dog by a rope.
He had overtaken him just as he was entering the Bangor
House. He was then tied on the top of the stage, but
being wet and cold, several times in the course of the
178
journey he jumped off, and I saw him dangling by his
neck. This dog was depended on to stop bears with.
He had already stopped one somewhere in New Hampshire,
and I can testify that he stopped a stage in Maine.
This party of four probably paid nothing for the dog's
ride, nor for his run, while our party of three paid two
dollars&mdash;and were charged four&mdash;for the light canoe
which lay still on the top.

It soon began to rain, and grew more and more
stormy as the day advanced. This was the third time
that I had passed over this route, and it rained steadily
each time all day. We accordingly saw but little of the
country. The stage was crowded all the way, and I
attended the more to my fellow-travelers. If you had
looked inside this coach you would have thought that
we were prepared to run the gauntlet of a band of robbers,
for there were four or five guns on the front seat,
the Indian's included, and one or two on the back one,
each man holding his darling in his arms. One had a gun
which carried twelve to a pound. It appeared that this
party of hunters was going our way, but much farther,&mdash;down
the Allegash and St. John, and thence up some
other stream, and across to the Restigouche and the Bay
of Chaleur, to be gone six weeks. They had canoes, axes,
and supplies deposited some distance along the route.
They carried flour, and were to have new bread made
every day. Their leader was a handsome man about
thirty years old, of good height, but not apparently
robust, of gentlemanly address and faultless toilet; such
a one as you might expect to meet on Broadway. In fact,
in the popular sense of the word, he was the most "gentlemanly"
179
appearing man in the stage, or that we saw
on the road. He had a fair white complexion, as if he
had always lived in the shade, and an intellectual face,
and with his quiet manners might have passed for a
divinity student who had seen something of the world.
I was surprised to find, on talking with him in the
course of the day's journey, that he was a hunter at all,&mdash;for
his gun was not much exposed,&mdash;and yet more
to find that he was probably the chief white hunter of
Maine, and was known all along the road. He had also
hunted in some of the States farther south and west. I
afterwards heard him spoken of as one who could endure
a great deal of exposure and fatigue without showing the
effect of it; and he could not only use guns, but make
them, being himself a gunsmith. In the spring, he had
saved a stage-driver and two passengers from drowning
in the backwater of the Piscataquis in Foxcroft on this
road, having swum ashore in the freezing water and
made a raft and got them off,&mdash;though the horses were
drowned,&mdash;at great risk to himself, while the only other
man who could swim withdrew to the nearest house to
prevent freezing. He could now ride over this road for
nothing. He knew our man, and remarked that we had
a good Indian there, a good hunter; adding that he was
said to be worth $6000. The Indian also knew him, and
said to me, "the great hunter."

The former told me that he practiced a kind of still-hunting,
new or uncommon in those parts; that the
caribou, for instance, fed round and round the same
meadow, returning on the same path, and he lay in wait
for them.
180

The Indian sat on the front seat, saying nothing to
anybody, with a stolid expression of face, as if barely
awake to what was going on. Again I was struck by
the peculiar vagueness of his replies when addressed in
the stage, or at the taverns. He really never said anything
on such occasions. He was merely stirred up, like
a wild beast, and passively muttered some insignificant
response. His answer, in such cases, was never the consequence
of a positive mental energy, but vague as a
puff of smoke, suggesting no responsibility, and if you
considered it, you would find that you had got nothing
out of him. This was instead of the conventional palaver
and smartness of the white man, and equally profitable.
Most get no more than this out of the Indian, and pronounce
him stolid accordingly. I was surprised to see
what a foolish and impertinent style a Maine man, a
passenger, used in addressing him, as if he were a child,
which only made his eyes glisten a little. A tipsy Canadian
asked him at a tavern, in a drawling tone, if he
smoked, to which he answered with an indefinite "Yes."
"Won't you lend me your pipe a little while?" asked the
other. He replied, looking straight by the man's head,
with a face singularly vacant to all neighboring interests,
"Me got no pipe;" yet I had seen him put a new one,
with a supply of tobacco, into his pocket that morning.

Our little canoe, so neat and strong, drew a favorable
criticism from all the wiseacres among the tavern
loungers along the road. By the roadside, close to the
wheels, I noticed a splendid great purple fringed orchis
with a spike as big as an epilobium, which I would fain
have stopped the stage to pluck, but as this had never
181
been known to stop a bear, like the cur on the stage, the
driver would probably have thought it a waste of time.

When we reached the lake, about half past eight in
the evening, it was still steadily raining, and harder than
before; and, in that fresh, cool atmosphere, the hylodes
were peeping and the toads ringing about the lake universally,
as in the spring with us. It was as if the season
had revolved backward two or three months, or I had
arrived at the abode of perpetual spring.

We had expected to go upon the lake at once, and,
after paddling up two or three miles, to camp on one of
its islands; but on account of the steady and increasing
rain, we decided to go to one of the taverns for the night,
though, for my own part, I should have preferred to
camp out.

About four o'clock the next morning (July 24), though
it was quite cloudy, accompanied by the landlord to the
water's edge, in the twilight, we launched our canoe
from a rock on the Moosehead Lake. When I was there
four years before, we had a rather small canoe for three
persons, and I had thought that this time I would get a
larger one, but the present one was even smaller than
that. It was 18¼ feet long by 2 feet 6½ inches wide in the
middle, and one foot deep within, so I found by measurement,
and I judged that it would weigh not far from
eighty pounds. The Indian had recently made it himself,
and its smallness was partly compensated for by its
newness, as well as stanchness and solidity, it being
made of very thick bark and ribs. Our baggage weighed
about 166 pounds, so that the canoe carried about
600 pounds in all, or the weight of four men. The
182
principal part of the baggage was, as usual, placed in
the middle of the broadest part, while we stowed ourselves
in the chinks and crannies that were left before
and behind it, where there was no room to extend our
legs, the loose articles being tucked into the ends. The
canoe was thus as closely packed as a market-basket,
and might possibly have been upset without spilling any
of its contents. The Indian sat on a cross-bar in the
stern, but we flat on the bottom, with a splint or chip
behind our backs, to protect them from the cross-bar,
and one of us commonly paddled with the Indian. He
foresaw that we should not want a pole till we reached
the Umbazookskus River, it being either deadwater or
down-stream so far, and he was prepared to make a sail
of his blanket in the bows if the wind should be fair; but
we never used it.

It had rained more or less the four previous days, so
that we thought we might count on some fair weather.
The wind was at first southwesterly.

Paddling along the eastern side of the lake in the still
of the morning, we soon saw a few sheldrakes, which
the Indian called Shecorways, and some peetweets,
Naramekechus, on the rocky shore; we also saw and
heard loons, Medawisla, which he said was a sign of
wind. It was inspiriting to hear the regular dip of the
paddles, as if they were our fins or flippers, and to realize
that we were at length fairly embarked. We who had felt
strangely as stage-passengers and tavern-lodgers were
suddenly naturalized there and presented with the freedom
of the lakes and the woods. Having passed the
small rocky isles within two or three miles of the foot of
183
the lake, we had a short consultation respecting our
course, and inclined to the western shore for the sake of
its lee; for otherwise, if the wind should rise, it would be
impossible for us to reach Mount Kineo, which is about
midway up the lake on the east side, but at its narrowest
part, where probably we could recross if we took the
western side. The wind is the chief obstacle to crossing
the lakes, especially in so small a canoe. The Indian
remarked several times that he did not like to cross the
lakes "in littlum canoe," but nevertheless, "just as we
say, it made no odds to him." He sometimes took a
straight course up the middle of the lake between Sugar
and Deer islands, when there was no wind.

Measured on the map, Moosehead Lake is twelve
miles wide at the widest place, and thirty miles long in
a direct line, but longer as it lies. The captain of the
steamer called it thirty-eight miles as he steered. We
should probably go about forty. The Indian said that
it was called "Mspame, because large water." Squaw
Mountain rose darkly on our left, near the outlet of
the Kennebec, and what the Indian called Spencer Bay
Mountain, on the east, and already we saw Mount
Kineo before us in the north.

Paddling near the shore, we frequently heard the pe-pe
of the olive-sided flycatcher, also the wood pewee, and
the kingfisher, thus early in the morning. The Indian
reminding us that he could not work without eating, we
stopped to breakfast on the main shore, southwest of
Deer Island, at a spot where the Mimulus ringens grew
abundantly. We took out our bags, and the Indian made
a fire under a very large bleached log, using white pine
184
bark from a stump, though he said that hemlock was
better, and kindling with canoe birch bark. Our table
was a large piece of freshly peeled birch bark, laid
wrong side up, and our breakfast consisted of hard-bread,
fried pork, and strong coffee, well sweetened, in
which we did not miss the milk.

While we were getting breakfast, a brood of twelve
black dippers, half grown, came paddling by within
three or four rods, not at all alarmed; and they loitered
about as long as we stayed, now huddled close
together, within a circle of eighteen inches in diameter,
now moving off in a long line, very cunningly. Yet they
bore a certain proportion to the great Moosehead Lake
on whose bosom they floated, and I felt as if they were
under its protection.

Looking northward from this place it appeared as if
we were entering a large bay, and we did not know
whether we should be obliged to diverge from our course
and keep outside a point which we saw, or should find
a passage between this and the mainland. I consulted
my map and used my glass, and the Indian did the
same, but we could not find our place exactly on the
map, nor could we detect any break in the shore. When
I asked the Indian the way, he answered, "I don't
know," which I thought remarkable, since he had said
that he was familiar with the lake; but it appeared that
he had never been up this side. It was misty dog-day
weather, and we had already penetrated a smaller bay
of the same kind, and knocked the bottom out of it,
though we had been obliged to pass over a small bar,
between an island and the shore, where there was but
185
just breadth and depth enough to float the canoe, and
the Indian had observed, "Very easy makum bridge
here," but now it seemed that, if we held on, we should
be fairly embayed. Presently, however, though we had
not stirred, the mist lifted somewhat, and revealed a
break in the shore northward, showing that the point
was a portion of Deer Island, and that our course lay
westward of it. Where it had seemed a continuous shore
even through a glass, one portion was now seen by the
naked eye to be much more distant than the other which
overlapped it, merely by the greater thickness of the mist
which still rested on it, while the nearer or island portion
was comparatively bare and green. The line of separation
was very distinct, and the Indian immediately
remarked, "I guess you and I go there,&mdash;I guess
there's room for my canoe there." This was his common
expression instead of saying "we." He never addressed
us by our names, though curious to know how they were
spelled and what they meant, while we called him Polis.
He had already guessed very accurately at our ages, and
said that he was forty-eight.



Squaw Mountain, Moosehead Lake


After breakfast I emptied the melted pork that was
left into the lake, making what sailors call a "slick," and
watching to see how much it spread over and smoothed
the agitated surface. The Indian looked at it a moment
and said, "That make hard paddlum thro'; hold 'em
canoe. So say old times."

We hastily reloaded, putting the dishes loose in the
bows, that they might be at hand when wanted, and set
out again. The western shore, near which we paddled
along, rose gently to a considerable height, and was
186
everywhere densely covered with the forest, in which was
a large proportion of hard wood to enliven and relieve the
fir and spruce.

The Indian said that the usnea lichen which we saw
hanging from the trees was called chorchorque. We
asked him the names of several small birds which we
heard this morning. The wood thrush, which was quite
common, and whose note he imitated, he said was called
Adelungquamooktum; but sometimes he could not tell
the name of some small bird which I heard and knew,
but he said, "I tell all the birds about here,&mdash;this country;
can't tell littlum noise, but I see 'em, then I can tell."

I observed that I should like to go to school to him to
learn his language, living on the Indian island the while;
could not that be done? "Oh, yer," he replied, "good
many do so." I asked how long he thought it would
take. He said one week. I told him that in this voyage
I would tell him all I knew, and he should tell me all he
knew, to which he readily agreed.

The birds sang quite as in our woods,&mdash;the red-eye,
redstart, veery, wood pewee, etc., but we saw no bluebirds
in all our journey, and several told me in Bangor
that they had not the bluebird there. Mount Kineo,
which was generally visible, though occasionally concealed
by islands or the mainland in front, had a level
bar of cloud concealing its summit, and all the mountain-tops
about the lake were cut off at the same height.
Ducks of various kinds&mdash;sheldrake, summer ducks,
etc.&mdash;were quite common, and ran over the water
before us as fast as a horse trots. Thus they were soon
out of sight.
187

The Indian asked the meaning of reality, as near as
I could make out the word, which he said one of us had
used; also of "interrent," that is, intelligent. I observed
that he could rarely sound the letter r, but used l, as also
r for l sometimes; as load for road, pickelel for pickerel,
Soogle Island for Sugar Island, lock for rock, etc. Yet
he trilled the r pretty well after me.

He generally added the syllable um to his words when
he could,&mdash;as paddlum, etc. I have once heard a
Chippeway lecture, who made his audience laugh unintentionally
by putting m after the word too, which word
he brought in continually and unnecessarily, accenting
and prolonging this sound into m-ah sonorously, as if
it were necessary to bring in so much of his vernacular
as a relief to his organs, a compensation for twisting his
jaws about, and putting his tongue into every corner
of his mouth, as he complained that he was obliged to
do when he spoke English. There was so much of the
Indian accent resounding through his English, so much
of the "bow-arrow tang" as my neighbor calls it, and I
have no doubt that word seemed to him the best pronounced.
It was a wild and refreshing sound, like that
of the wind among the pines, or the booming of the surf
on the shore.

I asked him the meaning of the word Musketicook,
the Indian name of Concord River. He pronounced it
Muskéeticook, emphasizing the second syllable with a
peculiar guttural sound, and said that it meant "deadwater,"
which it is, and in this definition he agreed
exactly with the St. Francis Indian with whom I talked
in 1853.
188

On a point on the mainland some miles southwest of
Sand-bar Island, where we landed to stretch our legs
and look at the vegetation, going inland a few steps, I
discovered a fire still glowing beneath its ashes, where
somebody had breakfasted, and a bed of twigs prepared
for the following night. So I knew not only that they
had just left, but that they designed to return, and by the
breadth of the bed that there was more than one in
the party. You might have gone within six feet of these
signs without seeing them. There grew the beaked
hazel, the only hazel which I saw on this journey, the
diervilla, rue seven feet high, which was very abundant
on all the lake and river shores, and Cornus stolonifera,
or red osier, whose bark, the Indian said, was good
to smoke, and was called maquoxigill, "tobacco before
white people came to this country, Indian tobacco."

The Indian was always very careful in approaching
the shore, lest he should injure his canoe on the rocks,
letting it swing round slowly sidewise, and was still more
particular that we should not step into it on shore, nor
till it floated free, and then should step gently lest we
should open its seams, or make a hole in the bottom.
He said that he would tell us when to jump.

Soon after leaving this point we passed the Kennebec,
or outlet of the lake, and heard the falls at the dam
there, for even Moosehead Lake is dammed. After
passing Deer Island, we saw the little steamer from
Greenville, far east in the middle of the lake, and she
appeared nearly stationary. Sometimes we could hardly
tell her from an island which had a few trees on it.
Here we were exposed to the wind from over the whole
189
breadth of the lake, and ran a little risk of being swamped.
While I had my eye fixed on the spot where a large fish
had leaped, we took in a gallon or two of water, which
filled my lap; but we soon reached the shore and took
the canoe over the bar, at Sand-bar Island, a few feet
wide only, and so saved a considerable distance. One
landed first at a more sheltered place, and walking round
caught the canoe by the prow, to prevent it being injured
against the shore.

Again we crossed a broad bay opposite the mouth
of Moose River, before reaching the narrow strait at
Mount Kineo, made what the voyageurs call a traverse,
and found the water quite rough. A very little wind on
these broad lakes raises a sea which will swamp a canoe.
Looking off from the shore, the surface may appear to be
very little agitated, almost smooth, a mile distant, or if
you see a few white crests they appear nearly level with
the rest of the lake; but when you get out so far, you
may find quite a sea running, and ere long, before you
think of it, a wave will gently creep up the side of the
canoe and fill your lap, like a monster deliberately
covering you with its slime before it swallows you, or it
will strike the canoe violently, and break into it. The
same thing may happen when the wind rises suddenly,
though it were perfectly calm and smooth there a few
minutes before; so that nothing can save you, unless
you can swim ashore, for it is impossible to get into a
canoe again when it is upset. Since you sit flat on the
bottom, though the danger should not be imminent, a
little water is a great inconvenience, not to mention the
wetting of your provisions. We rarely crossed even a
190
bay directly, from point to point, when there was wind,
but made a slight curve corresponding somewhat to the
shore, that we might the sooner reach it if the wind
increased.

When the wind is aft, and not too strong, the Indian
makes a spritsail of his blanket. He thus easily skims
over the whole length of this lake in a day.

The Indian paddled on one side, and one of us on the
other, to keep the canoe steady, and when he wanted to
change hands he would say, "T' other side." He asserted,
in answer to our questions, that he had never upset a
canoe himself, though he may have been upset by others.

Think of our little eggshell of a canoe tossing across
that great lake, a mere black speck to the eagle soaring
above it!

My companion trailed for trout as we paddled along,
but the Indian warning him that a big fish might upset
us, for there are some very large ones there, he agreed
to pass the line quickly to him in the stern if he had a
bite. Besides trout, I heard of cusk, whitefish, etc., as
found in this lake.

While we were crossing this bay, where Mount Kineo
rose dark before us, within two or three miles, the Indian
repeated the tradition respecting this mountain's having
anciently been a cow moose,&mdash;how a mighty Indian
hunter, whose name I forget, succeeded in killing this
queen of the moose tribe with great difficulty, while her
calf was killed somewhere among the islands in Penobscot
Bay, and, to his eyes, this mountain had still the
form of the moose in a reclining posture, its precipitous
side presenting the outline of her head. He told this at
191
some length, though it did not amount to much, and
with apparent good faith, and asked us how we supposed
the hunter could have killed such a mighty moose
as that,&mdash;how we could do it. Whereupon a man-of-war
to fire broadsides into her was suggested, etc. An
Indian tells such a story as if he thought it deserved to
have a good deal said about it, only he has not got it to
say, and so he makes up for the deficiency by a drawling
tone, long-windedness, and a dumb wonder which he
hopes will be contagious.

We approached the land again through pretty rough
water, and then steered directly across the lake, at its
narrowest part, to the eastern side, and were soon
partly under the lee of the mountain, about a mile north
of the Kineo House, having paddled about twenty miles.
It was now about noon.

We designed to stop there that afternoon and night,
and spent half an hour looking along the shore northward
for a suitable place to camp. We took out all our
baggage at one place in vain, it being too rocky and
uneven, and while engaged in this search we made our
first acquaintance with the moose-fly. At length, half
a mile farther north, by going half a dozen rods into the
dense spruce and fir wood on the side of the mountain,
almost as dark as a cellar, we found a place sufficiently
clear and level to lie down on, after cutting away a few
bushes. We required a space only seven feet by six for
our bed, the fire being four or five feet in front, though it
made no odds how rough the hearth was; but it was not
always easy to find this in those woods. The Indian first
cleared a path to it from the shore with his axe, and we
192
then carried up all our baggage, pitched our tent, and
made our bed, in order to be ready for foul weather,
which then threatened us, and for the night. He gathered
a large armful of fir twigs, breaking them off, which
he said were the best for our bed, partly, I thought,
because they were the largest and could be most rapidly
collected. It had been raining more or less for four or
five days, and the wood was even damper than usual, but
he got dry bark for the fire from the under side of a dead
leaning hemlock, which, he said, he could always do.

This noon his mind was occupied with a law question,
and I referred him to my companion, who was a lawyer.
It appeared that he had been buying land lately (I think
it was a hundred acres), but there was probably an
incumbrance to it, somebody else claiming to have
bought some grass on it for this year. He wished to
know to whom the grass belonged, and was told that
if the other man could prove that he bought the grass
before he, Polis, bought the land, the former could take
it, whether the latter knew it or not. To which he only
answered, "Strange!" He went over this several times,
fairly sat down to it, with his back to a tree, as if he
meant to confine us to this topic henceforth; but as he
made no headway, only reached the jumping-off place
of his wonder at white men's institutions after each
explanation, we let the subject die.

He said that he had fifty acres of grass, potatoes, etc.,
somewhere above Oldtown, besides some about his
house; that he hired a good deal of his work, hoeing,
etc., and preferred white men to Indians, because "they
keep steady, and know how."
193

After dinner we returned southward along the shore,
in the canoe, on account of the difficulty of climbing
over the rocks and fallen trees, and began to ascend the
mountain along the edge of the precipice. But a smart
shower coming up just then, the Indian crept under his
canoe, while we, being protected by our rubber coats,
proceeded to botanize. So we sent him back to the camp
for shelter, agreeing that he should come there for us
with his canoe toward night. It had rained a little in the
forenoon, and we trusted that this would be the clearing-up
shower, which it proved; but our feet and legs
were thoroughly wet by the bushes. The clouds breaking
away a little, we had a glorious wild view, as we ascended,
of the broad lake with its fluctuating surface and numerous
forest-clad islands, extending beyond our sight both
north and south, and the boundless forest undulating
away from its shores on every side, as densely packed
as a rye-field, and enveloping nameless mountains in
succession; but above all, looking westward over a large
island, was visible a very distant part of the lake, though
we did not then suspect it to be Moosehead,&mdash;at first
a mere broken white line seen through the tops of the
island trees, like hay-caps, but spreading to a lake when
we got higher. Beyond this we saw what appears to be
called Bald Mountain on the map, some twenty-five
miles distant, near the sources of the Penobscot. It was
a perfect lake of the woods. But this was only a transient
gleam, for the rain was not quite over.

Looking southward, the heavens were completely
overcast, the mountains capped with clouds, and the
lake generally wore a dark and stormy appearance, but
194
from its surface just north of Sugar Island, six or eight
miles distant, there was reflected upward to us through
the misty air a bright blue tinge from the distant unseen
sky of another latitude beyond. They probably had a
clear sky then at Greenville, the south end of the lake.
Standing on a mountain in the midst of a lake, where
would you look for the first sign of approaching fair
weather? Not into the heavens, it seems, but into the
lake.

Again we mistook a little rocky islet seen through the
"drisk," with some taller bare trunks or stumps on it,
for the steamer with its smoke-pipes, but as it had not
changed its position after half an hour, we were undeceived.
So much do the works of man resemble the
works of nature. A moose might mistake a steamer for
a floating isle, and not be scared till he heard its puffing
or its whistle.

If I wished to see a mountain or other scenery under
the most favorable auspices, I would go to it in foul
weather, so as to be there when it cleared up; we are
then in the most suitable mood, and nature is most fresh
and inspiring. There is no serenity so fair as that which
is just established in a tearful eye.

Jackson, in his Report on the Geology of Maine, in
1838, says of this mountain: "Hornstone, which will
answer for flints, occurs in various parts of the State,
where trap-rocks have acted upon silicious slate. The
largest mass of this stone known in the world is Mount
Kineo, upon Moosehead Lake, which appears to be
entirely composed of it, and rises seven hundred feet
above the lake level. This variety of hornstone I have
195
seen in every part of New England in the form of Indian
arrowheads, hatchets, chisels, etc., which were probably
obtained from this mountain by the aboriginal
inhabitants of the country." I have myself found hundreds
of arrowheads made of the same material. It is
generally slate-colored, with white specks, becoming a
uniform white where exposed to the light and air, and
it breaks with a conchoidal fracture, producing a ragged
cutting edge. I noticed some conchoidal hollows more
than a foot in diameter. I picked up a small thin piece
which had so sharp an edge that I used it as a dull knife,
and to see what I could do, fairly cut off an aspen one
inch thick with it, by bending it and making many cuts;
though I cut my fingers badly with the back of it in the
meanwhile.



Moosehead Lake, from Mount Kineo


From the summit of the precipice which forms the
southern and eastern sides of this mountain peninsula,
and is its most remarkable feature, being described as
five or six hundred feet high, we looked, and probably
might have jumped, down to the water, or to the seemingly
dwarfish trees on the narrow neck of land which
connects it with the main. It is a dangerous place to try
the steadiness of your nerves. Hodge says that these
cliffs descend "perpendicularly ninety feet" below the
surface of the water.

The plants which chiefly attracted our attention on
this mountain were the mountain cinquefoil (Potentilla
tridentata), abundant and in bloom still at the very base,
by the waterside, though it is usually confined to the
summits of mountains in our latitude; very beautiful
harebells overhanging the precipice; bear-berry; the
196
Canada blueberry (Vaccinium Canadense), similar to
the V. Pennsylvanicum, our earliest one, but entire-leaved
and with a downy stem and leaf (I have not seen
it in Massachusetts); Diervilla trifida; Microstylis
ophioglossoides, an orchidaceous plant new to us; wild
holly (Nemopanthes Canadensis); the great round-leaved
orchis (Platanthera orbiculata), not long in bloom;
Spiranthes cernua, at the top; bunchberry, reddening
as we ascended, green at the base of the mountain, red
at the top; and the small fern Woodsia ilvensis, growing
in tufts, now in fruit. I have also received Liparis
liliifolia, or tway-blade, from this spot. Having explored
the wonders of the mountain, and the weather being
now entirely cleared up, we commenced the descent.
We met the Indian, puffing and panting, about one third
of the way up, but thinking that he must be near the top,
and saying that it took his breath away. I thought that
superstition had something to do with his fatigue. Perhaps
he believed that he was climbing over the back of a
tremendous moose. He said that he had never ascended
Kineo. On reaching the canoe we found that he had
caught a lake trout weighing about three pounds, at the
depth of twenty-five or thirty feet, while we were on the
mountain.

When we got to the camp, the canoe was taken out
and turned over, and a log laid across it to prevent its
being blown away. The Indian cut some large logs of
damp and rotten hard wood to smoulder and keep fire
through the night. The trout was fried for supper. Our
tent was of thin cotton cloth and quite small, forming
with the ground a triangular prism closed at the rear end,
197
six feet long, seven wide, and four high, so that we could
barely sit up in the middle. It required two forked
stakes, a smooth ridge-pole, and a dozen or more pins
to pitch it. It kept off dew and wind, and an ordinary
rain, and answered our purpose well enough. We
reclined within it till bedtime, each with his baggage at
his head, or else sat about the fire, having hung our wet
clothes on a pole before the fire for the night.

As we sat there, just before night, looking out through
the dusky wood, the Indian heard a noise which he said
was made by a snake. He imitated it at my request,
making a low whistling note,&mdash;pheet&mdash;pheet,&mdash;two
or three times repeated, somewhat like the peep of the
hylodes, but not so loud. In answer to my inquiries, he
said that he had never seen them while making it, but
going to the spot he finds the snake. This, he said on
another occasion, was a sign of rain. When I had
selected this place for our camp, he had remarked that
there were snakes there,&mdash;he saw them. "But they
won't do any hurt," I said. "Oh, no," he answered,
"just as you say; it makes no difference to me."

He lay on the right side of the tent, because, as he
said, he was partly deaf in one ear, and he wanted to lie
with his good ear up. As we lay there, he inquired if I
ever heard "Indian sing." I replied that I had not
often, and asked him if he would not favor us with a
song. He readily assented, and, lying on his back, with
his blanket wrapped around him, he commenced a slow,
somewhat nasal, yet musical chant, in his own language,
which probably was taught his tribe long ago by the
Catholic missionaries. He translated it to us, sentence
198
by sentence, afterward, wishing to see if we could remember
it. It proved to be a very simple religious exercise
or hymn, the burden of which was, that there was only
one God who ruled all the world. This was hammered
(or sung) out very thin, so that some stanzas well-nigh
meant nothing at all, merely keeping up the idea. He
then said that he would sing us a Latin song; but we
did not detect any Latin, only one or two Greek words
in it,&mdash;the rest may have been Latin with the Indian
pronunciation.

His singing carried me back to the period of the discovery
of America, to San Salvador and the Incas, when
Europeans first encountered the simple faith of the
Indian. There was, indeed, a beautiful simplicity about
it; nothing of the dark and savage, only the mild and
infantile. The sentiments of humility and reverence
chiefly were expressed.

It was a dense and damp spruce and fir wood in
which we lay, and, except for our fire, perfectly dark;
and when I awoke in the night, I either heard an owl
from deeper in the forest behind us, or a loon from a
distance over the lake. Getting up some time after midnight
to collect the scattered brands together, while my
companions were sound asleep, I observed, partly in
the fire, which had ceased to blaze, a perfectly regular
elliptical ring of light, about five inches in its shortest
diameter, six or seven in its longer, and from one eighth
to one quarter of an inch wide. It was fully as bright as
the fire, but not reddish or scarlet, like a coal, but a
white and slumbering light, like the glow-worm's. I
could tell it from the fire only by its whiteness. I saw at
199
once that it must be phosphorescent wood, which I had
so often heard of, but never chanced to see. Putting my
finger on it, with a little hesitation, I found that it was
a piece of dead moose-wood (Acer striatum) which the
Indian had cut off in a slanting direction the evening
before. Using my knife, I discovered that the light proceeded
from that portion of the sap-wood immediately
under the bark, and thus presented a regular ring at the
end, which, indeed, appeared raised above the level of
the wood, and when I pared off the bark and cut into the
sap, it was all aglow along the log. I was surprised to
find the wood quite hard and apparently sound, though
probably decay had commenced in the sap, and I cut
out some little triangular chips, and, placing them in the
hollow of my hand, carried them into the camp, waked
my companion, and showed them to him. They lit up
the inside of my hand, revealing the lines and wrinkles,
and appearing exactly like coals of fire raised to a white
heat, and I saw at once how, probably, the Indian jugglers
had imposed on their people and on travelers,
pretending to hold coals of fire in their mouths.

I also noticed that part of a decayed stump within
four or five feet of the fire, an inch wide and six inches
long, soft and shaking wood, shone with equal brightness.

I neglected to ascertain whether our fire had anything
to do with this, but the previous day's rain and long-continued
wet weather undoubtedly had.

I was exceedingly interested by this phenomenon, and
already felt paid for my journey. It could hardly have
thrilled me more if it had taken the form of letters, or
200
of the human face. If I had met with this ring of light
while groping in this forest alone, away from any fire, I
should have been still more surprised. I little thought
that there was such a light shining in the darkness of
the wilderness for me.

The next day the Indian told me their name for this
light,&mdash;artoosoqu'&mdash;and on my inquiring concerning
the will-o'-the-wisp, and the like phenomena, he said
that his "folks" sometimes saw fires passing along at
various heights, even as high as the trees, and making
a noise. I was prepared after this to hear of the most
startling and unimagined phenomena, witnessed by
"his folks;" they are abroad at all hours and seasons
in scenes so unfrequented by white men. Nature must
have made a thousand revelations to them which are
still secrets to us.

I did not regret my not having seen this before, since
I now saw it under circumstances so favorable. I was
in just the frame of mind to see something wonderful,
and this was a phenomenon adequate to my circumstances
and expectation, and it put me on the alert to see
more like it. I exulted like "a pagan suckled in a creed"
that had never been worn at all, but was bran-new, and
adequate to the occasion. I let science slide, and rejoiced
in that light as if it had been a fellow creature. I saw
that it was excellent, and was very glad to know that it
was so cheap. A scientific explanation, as it is called,
would have been altogether out of place there. That is
for pale daylight. Science with its retorts would have
put me to sleep; it was the opportunity to be ignorant
that I improved. It suggested to me that there was
201
something to be seen if one had eyes. It made a believer
of me more than before. I believed that the woods were
not tenantless, but choke-full of honest spirits as good
as myself any day,&mdash;not an empty chamber, in which
chemistry was left to work alone, but an inhabited
house,&mdash;and for a few moments I enjoyed fellowship
with them. Your so-called wise man goes trying to persuade
himself that there is no entity there but himself
and his traps, but it is a great deal easier to believe the
truth. It suggested, too, that the same experience always
gives birth to the same sort of belief or religion. One revelation
has been made to the Indian, another to the white
man. I have much to learn of the Indian, nothing of the
missionary. I am not sure but all that would tempt me
to teach the Indian my religion would be his promise to
teach me his. Long enough I had heard of irrelevant
things; now at length I was glad to make acquaintance
with the light that dwells in rotten wood. Where is all
your knowledge gone to? It evaporates completely, for
it has no depth.

I kept those little chips and wet them again the next
night, but they emitted no light.


Saturday, July 25.


At breakfast this Saturday morning, the Indian,
evidently curious to know what would be expected of
him the next day, whether we should go along or not,
asked me how I spent the Sunday when at home. I told
him that I commonly sat in my chamber reading, etc.,
in the forenoon, and went to walk in the afternoon. At
which he shook his head and said, "Er, that is ver bad."
202
"How do you spend it?" I asked. He said that he did
no work, that he went to church at Oldtown when he
was at home; in short, he did as he had been taught by
the whites. This led to a discussion in which I found myself
in the minority. He stated that he was a Protestant,
and asked me if I was. I did not at first know what to
say, but I thought that I could answer with truth that I
was.

When we were washing the dishes in the lake, many
fishes, apparently chivin, came close up to us to get the
particles of grease.

The weather seemed to be more settled this morning,
and we set out early in order to finish our voyage up
the lake before the wind arose. Soon after starting, the
Indian directed our attention to the Northeast Carry,
which we could plainly see, about thirteen miles distant
in that direction as measured on the map, though it is
called much farther. This carry is a rude wooden railroad,
running north and south about two miles, perfectly
straight, from the lake to the Penobscot, through
a low tract, with a clearing three or four rods wide;
but low as it is, it passes over the height of land there.
This opening appeared as a clear bright, or light, point
in the horizon, resting on the edge of the lake, whose
breadth a hair could have covered at a considerable
distance from the eye, and of no appreciable height. We
should not have suspected it to be visible if the Indian
had not drawn our attention to it. It was a remarkable
kind of light to steer for,&mdash;daylight seen through a
vista in the forest,&mdash;but visible as far as an ordinary
beacon at night.
203

We crossed a deep and wide bay which makes eastward
north of Kineo, leaving an island on our left, and
keeping up the eastern side of the lake. This way or that
led to some Tomhegan or Socatarian stream, up which
the Indian had hunted, and whither I longed to go. The
last name, however, had a bogus sound, too much like
sectarian for me, as if a missionary had tampered with it;
but I knew that the Indians were very liberal. I think I
should have inclined to the Tomhegan first.

We then crossed another broad bay, which, as we
could no longer observe the shore particularly, afforded
ample time for conversation. The Indian said that he
had got his money by hunting, mostly high up the West
Branch of the Penobscot, and toward the head of the
St. John; he had hunted there from a boy, and knew
all about that region. His game had been beaver, otter,
black cat (or fisher), sable, moose, etc. Loup-cervier (or
Canada lynx) were plenty yet in burnt grounds. For
food in the woods, he uses partridges, ducks, dried
moose-meat, hedgehog, etc. Loons, too, were good,
only "bile 'em good." He told us at some length how
he had suffered from starvation when a mere lad, being
overtaken by winter when hunting with two grown
Indians in the northern part of Maine, and obliged to
leave their canoe on account of ice.

Pointing into the bay, he said that it was the way
to various lakes which he knew. Only solemn bear-haunted
mountains, with their great wooded slopes,
were visible; where, as man is not, we suppose some
other power to be. My imagination personified the
slopes themselves, as if by their very length they would
204
waylay you, and compel you to camp again on them
before night. Some invisible glutton would seem to drop
from the trees and gnaw at the heart of the solitary
hunter who threaded those woods; and yet I was
tempted to walk there. The Indian said that he had
been along there several times.

I asked him how he guided himself in the woods.
"Oh," said he, "I can tell good many ways." When I
pressed him further, he answered, "Sometimes I lookum
side-hill," and he glanced toward a high hill or mountain
on the eastern shore, "great difference between
the north and south, see where the sun has shone most.
So trees,&mdash;the large limbs bend toward south. Sometimes
I lookum locks" (rocks). I asked what he saw
on the rocks, but he did not describe anything in particular,
answering vaguely, in a mysterious or drawling
tone, "Bare locks on lake shore,&mdash;great difference between
north, south, east, west, side,&mdash;can tell what the
sun has shone on." "Suppose," said I, "that I should
take you in a dark night, right up here into the middle
of the woods a hundred miles, set you down, and turn
you round quickly twenty times, could you steer straight
to Oldtown?" "Oh, yer," said he, "have done pretty
much same thing. I will tell you. Some years ago I
met an old white hunter at Millinocket; very good
hunter. He said he could go anywhere in the woods. He
wanted to hunt with me that day, so we start. We chase
a moose all the forenoon, round and round, till middle
of afternoon, when we kill him. Then I said to him,
'Now you go straight to camp. Don't go round and
round where we've been, but go straight.' He said, 'I
205
can't do that, I don't know where I am.' 'Where you
think camp?' I asked. He pointed so. Then I laugh
at him. I take the lead and go right off the other way,
cross our tracks many times, straight camp." "How do
you do that?" asked I. "Oh, I can't tell you," he replied.
"Great difference between me and white man."

It appeared as if the sources of information were so
various that he did not give a distinct, conscious attention
to any one, and so could not readily refer to any
when questioned about it, but he found his way very
much as an animal does. Perhaps what is commonly
called instinct in the animal, in this case is merely a
sharpened and educated sense. Often, when an Indian
says, "I don't know," in regard to the route he is to
take, he does not mean what a white man would by
those words, for his Indian instinct may tell him still as
much as the most confident white man knows. He does
not carry things in his head, nor remember the route
exactly, like a white man, but relies on himself at the
moment. Not having experienced the need of the other
sort of knowledge, all labeled and arranged, he has not
acquired it.

The white hunter with whom I talked in the stage
knew some of the resources of the Indian. He said that
he steered by the wind, or by the limbs of the hemlocks,
which were largest on the south side; also sometimes,
when he knew that there was a lake near, by firing his
gun and listening to hear the direction and distance of
the echo from over it.

The course we took over this lake, and others afterward,
was rarely direct, but a succession of curves from
206
point to point, digressing considerably into each of the
bays; and this was not merely on account of the wind,
for the Indian, looking toward the middle of the lake,
said it was hard to go there, easier to keep near the
shore, because he thus got over it by successive reaches
and saw by the shore how he got along.

The following will suffice for a common experience
in crossing lakes in a canoe. As the forenoon advanced,
the wind increased. The last bay which we crossed
before reaching the desolate pier at the Northeast Carry
was two or three miles over, and the wind was southwesterly.
After going a third of the way, the waves had
increased so as occasionally to wash into the canoe, and
we saw that it was worse and worse ahead. At first we
might have turned about, but were not willing to. It
would have been of no use to follow the course of the
shore, for not only the distance would have been much
greater, but the waves ran still higher there on account
of the greater sweep the wind had. At any rate it would
have been dangerous now to alter our course, because
the waves would have struck us at an advantage. It will
not do to meet them at right angles, for then they will
wash in both sides, but you must take them quartering.
So the Indian stood up in the canoe, and exerted all his
skill and strength for a mile or two, while I paddled
right along in order to give him more steerage-way. For
more than a mile he did not allow a single wave to strike
the canoe as it would, but turned it quickly from this
side to that, so that it would always be on or near the
crest of a wave when it broke, where all its force was
spent, and we merely settled down with it. At length I
207
jumped out on to the end of the pier, against which the
waves were dashing violently, in order to lighten the
canoe, and catch it at the landing, which was not much
sheltered; but just as I jumped we took in two or three
gallons of water. I remarked to the Indian, "You managed
that well," to which he replied, "Ver few men do
that. Great many waves; when I look out for one,
another come quick."

While the Indian went to get cedar bark, etc., to
carry his canoe with, we cooked the dinner on the shore,
at this end of the carry, in the midst of a sprinkling rain.

He prepared his canoe for carrying in this wise. He
took a cedar shingle or splint eighteen inches long and
four or five wide, rounded at one end, that the corners
might not be in the way, and tied it with cedar bark by
two holes made midway, near the edge on each side, to
the middle cross-bar of the canoe. When the canoe was
lifted upon his head bottom up, this shingle, with its
rounded end uppermost, distributed the weight over his
shoulders and head, while a band of cedar bark, tied to
the cross-bar on each side of the shingle, passed round
his breast, and another longer one, outside of the last,
round his forehead; also a hand on each side-rail served
to steer the canoe and keep it from rocking. He thus
carried it with his shoulders, head, breast, forehead, and
both hands, as if the upper part of his body were all one
hand to clasp and hold it. If you know of a better way,
I should like to hear of it. A cedar tree furnished all the
gear in this case, as it had the woodwork of the canoe.
One of the paddles rested on the cross-bars in the bows.
I took the canoe upon my head and found that I could
208
carry it with ease, though the straps were not fitted to
my shoulders; but I let him carry it, not caring to establish
a different precedent, though he said that if I would
carry the canoe, he would take all the rest of the baggage,
except my companion's. This shingle remained
tied to the cross-bar throughout the voyage, was always
ready for the carries, and also served to protect the back
of one passenger.

We were obliged to go over this carry twice, our load
was so great. But the carries were an agreeable variety,
and we improved the opportunity to gather the rare
plants which we had seen, when we returned empty
handed.

We reached the Penobscot about four o'clock, and
found there some St. Francis Indians encamped on the
bank, in the same place where I camped with four
Indians four years before. They were making a canoe,
and, as then, drying moose-meat. The meat looked very
suitable to make a black broth at least. Our Indian said
it was not good. Their camp was covered with spruce
bark. They had got a young moose, taken in the river
a fortnight before, confined in a sort of cage of logs piled
up cob-fashion, seven or eight feet high. It was quite
tame, about four feet high, and covered with moose-flies.
There was a large quantity of cornel (C. stolonifera),
red maple, and also willow and aspen boughs,
stuck through between the logs on all sides, butt ends
out, and on their leaves it was browsing. It looked at
first as if it were in a bower rather than a pen.

Our Indian said that he used black spruce roots to sew
canoes with, obtaining it from high lands or mountains.
209
The St. Francis Indian thought that white spruce roots
might be best. But the former said, "No good, break,
can't split 'em;" also that they were hard to get, deep
in ground, but the black were near the surface, on higher
land, as well as tougher. He said that the white spruce
was subekoondark, black, skusk. I told him I thought
that I could make a canoe, but he expressed great doubt
of it; at any rate, he thought that my work would not be
"neat" the first time. An Indian at Greenville had told
me that the winter bark, that is, bark taken off before
the sap flows in May, was harder and much better than
summer bark.

Having reloaded, we paddled down the Penobscot,
which, as the Indian remarked, and even I detected,
remembering how it looked before, was uncommonly
full. We soon after saw a splendid yellow lily (Lilium
Canadense) by the shore, which I plucked. It was six
feet high, and had twelve flowers, in two whorls, forming
a pyramid, such as I have seen in Concord. We afterward
saw many more thus tall along this stream, and
also still more numerous on the East Branch, and, on the
latter, one which I thought approached yet nearer to the
Lilium superbum. The Indian asked what we called it,
and said that the "loots" (roots) were good for soup,
that is, to cook with meat, to thicken it, taking the place
of flour. They get them in the fall. I dug some, and
found a mass of bulbs pretty deep in the earth, two
inches in diameter, looking, and even tasting, somewhat
like raw green corn on the ear.

When we had gone about three miles down the
Penobscot, we saw through the tree-tops a thunder-shower
210
coming up in the west, and we looked out a
camping-place in good season, about five o'clock, on the
west side, not far below the mouth of what Joe Aitteon,
in '53, called Lobster Stream, coming from Lobster
Pond. Our present Indian, however, did not admit this
name, nor even that of Matahumkeag, which is on the
map, but called the lake Beskabekuk.

I will describe, once for all, the routine of camping at
this season. We generally told the Indian that we would
stop at the first suitable place, so that he might be on the
lookout for it. Having observed a clear, hard, and flat
beach to land on, free from mud, and from stones which
would injure the canoe, one would run up the bank to
see if there were open and level space enough for the
camp between the trees, or if it could be easily cleared,
preferring at the same time a cool place, on account of
insects. Sometimes we paddled a mile or more before
finding one to our minds, for where the shore was suitable,
the bank would often be too steep, or else too low
and grassy, and therefore mosquitoey. We then took
out the baggage and drew up the canoe, sometimes turning
it over on shore for safety. The Indian cut a path to
the spot we had selected, which was usually within two or
three rods of the water, and we carried up our baggage.
One, perhaps, takes canoe birch bark, always at hand,
and dead dry wood or bark, and kindles a fire five or six
feet in front of where we intend to lie. It matters not,
commonly, on which side this is, because there is little
or no wind in so dense a wood at that season; and then
he gets a kettle of water from the river, and takes out the
pork, bread, coffee, etc., from their several packages.
211

Another, meanwhile, having the axe, cuts down the
nearest dead rock maple or other dry hard wood, collecting
several large logs to last through the night, also a
green stake, with a notch or fork to it, which is slanted
over the fire, perhaps resting on a rock or forked stake,
to hang the kettle on, and two forked stakes and a pole
for the tent.

The third man pitches the tent, cuts a dozen or more
pins with his knife, usually of moose-wood, the common
underwood, to fasten it down with, and then collects an
armful or two of fir twigs,[8] arbor-vitæ, spruce, or hemlock,
whichever is at hand, and makes the bed, beginning
at either end, and laying the twigs wrong side up,
in regular rows, covering the stub ends of the last row;
first, however, filling the hollows, if there are any, with
coarser material. Wrangel says that his guides in Siberia
first strewed a quantity of dry brushwood on the ground,
and then cedar twigs on that.

Commonly, by the time the bed is made, or within
fifteen or twenty minutes, the water boils, the pork is
fried, and supper is ready. We eat this sitting on the
ground, or a stump, if there is any, around a large piece
of birch bark for a table, each holding a dipper in one
hand and a piece of ship-bread or fried pork in the other,
frequently making a pass with his hand, or thrusting his
head into the smoke, to avoid the mosquitoes.

Next, pipes are lit by those who smoke, and veils are
donned by those who have them, and we hastily examine
and dry our plants, anoint our faces and hands, and go
to bed&mdash;and&mdash;the mosquitoes.
212

Though you have nothing to do but see the country,
there's rarely any time to spare, hardly enough to examine
a plant, before the night or drowsiness is upon you.

Such was the ordinary experience, but this evening
we had camped earlier on account of the rain, and had
more time.

We found that our camp to-night was on an old, and
now more than usually indistinct, supply road, running
along the river. What is called a road there shows no
ruts or trace of wheels, for they are not used; nor, indeed,
of runners, since they are used only in the winter
when the snow is several feet deep. It is only an indistinct
vista through the wood, which it takes an experienced
eye to detect.

We had no sooner pitched our tent than the thunder-shower
burst on us, and we hastily crept under it, drawing
our bags after us, curious to see how much of a shelter
our thin cotton roof was going to be in this excursion.
Though the violence of the rain forced a fine shower
through the cloth before it was fairly wetted and shrunk,
with which we were well bedewed, we managed to keep
pretty dry, only a box of matches having been left out
and spoiled, and before we were aware of it the shower
was over, and only the dripping trees imprisoned us.

Wishing to see what fishes there were in the river
there, we cast our lines over the wet bushes on the
shore, but they were repeatedly swept down the swift
stream in vain. So, leaving the Indian, we took the canoe
just before dark, and dropped down the river a few rods
to fish at the mouth of a sluggish brook on the opposite
side. We pushed up this a rod or two, where, perhaps,
213
only a canoe had been before. But though there were a
few small fishes, mostly chivin, there, we were soon
driven off by the mosquitoes. While there we heard the
Indian fire his gun twice in such rapid succession that
we thought it must be double-barreled, though we
observed afterward that it was single. His object was to
clean out and dry it after the rain, and he then loaded it
with ball, being now on ground where he expected to
meet with large game. This sudden, loud, crashing noise
in the still aisles of the forest, affected me like an insult to
nature, or ill manners at any rate, as if you were to fire
a gun in a hall or temple. It was not heard far, however,
except along the river, the sound being rapidly hushed
up or absorbed by the damp trees and mossy ground.

The Indian made a little smothered fire of damp
leaves close to the back of the camp, that the smoke
might drive through and keep out the mosquitoes; but
just before we fell asleep this suddenly blazed up, and
came near setting fire to the tent. We were considerably
molested by mosquitoes at this camp.


Sunday, July 26.


The note of the white-throated sparrow, a very inspiriting
but almost wiry sound, was the first heard in the
morning, and with this all the woods rang. This was the
prevailing bird in the northern part of Maine. The
forest generally was all alive with them at this season,
and they were proportionally numerous and musical
about Bangor. They evidently breed in that State.
Though commonly unseen, their simple ah, te-te-te,
te-te-te, te-te-te, so sharp and piercing, was as distinct to
214
the ear as the passage of a spark of fire shot into the
darkest of the forest would be to the eye. I thought that
they commonly uttered it as they flew. I hear this note
for a few days only in the spring, as they go through
Concord, and in the fall see them again going southward,
but then they are mute. We were commonly
aroused by their lively strain very early. What a glorious
time they must have in that wilderness, far from
mankind and election day!

I told the Indian that we would go to church to
Chesuncook this (Sunday) morning, some fifteen miles.
It was settled weather at last. A few swallows flitted
over the water, we heard Maryland yellow-throats along
the shore, the phebe notes of the chickadee, and, I
believe, redstarts, and moose-flies of large size pursued
us in midstream.

The Indian thought that we should lie by on Sunday.
Said he, "We come here lookum things, look all round;
but come Sunday, lock up all that, and then Monday
look again." He spoke of an Indian of his acquaintance
who had been with some ministers to Ktaadn, and had
told him how they conducted. This he described in a
low and solemn voice. "They make a long prayer every
morning and night, and at every meal. Come Sunday,"
said he, "they stop 'em, no go at all that day,&mdash;keep
still,&mdash;preach all day,&mdash;first one, then another, just
like church. Oh, ver good men." "One day," said he,
"going along a river, they came to the body of a man in
the water, drowned good while, all ready fall to pieces.
They go right ashore,&mdash;stop there, go no farther that
day,&mdash;they have meeting there, preach and pray just
215
like Sunday. Then they get poles and lift up the body,
and they go back and carry the body with them. Oh,
they ver good men."

I judged from this account that their every camp was
a camp-meeting, and they had mistaken their route,&mdash;they
should have gone to Eastham; that they wanted
an opportunity to preach somewhere more than to see
Ktaadn. I read of another similar party that seem to
have spent their time there singing the songs of Zion.
I was glad that I did not go to that mountain with such
slow coaches.

However, the Indian added, plying the paddle all the
while, that if we would go along, he must go with us, he
our man, and he suppose that if he no takum pay for
what he do Sunday, then ther's no harm, but if he takum
pay, then wrong. I told him that he was stricter than
white men. Nevertheless, I noticed that he did not forget
to reckon in the Sundays at last.

He appeared to be a very religious man, and said his
prayers in a loud voice, in Indian, kneeling before the
camp, morning and evening,&mdash;sometimes scrambling
up again in haste when he had forgotten this, and saying
them with great rapidity. In the course of the day, he
remarked, not very originally, "Poor man rememberum
God more than rich."

We soon passed the island where I had camped four
years before, and I recognized the very spot. The deadwater,
a mile or two below it, the Indian called Beskabekukskishtuk,
from the lake Beskabekuk, which empties
in above. This deadwater, he said, was "a great place
for moose always." We saw the grass bent where a
216
moose came out the night before, and the Indian said
that he could smell one as far as he could see him;
but, he added, that if he should see five or six to-day
close by canoe, he no shoot 'em. Accordingly, as he was
the only one of the party who had a gun, or had come
a-hunting, the moose were safe.

Just below this, a cat owl flew heavily over the stream,
and he, asking if I knew what it was, imitated very well
the common hoo, hoo, hoo, hoorer, hoo, of our woods;
making a hard, guttural sound, "Ugh, ugh, ugh,&mdash;ugh,
ugh." When we passed the Moose-horn, he said
that it had no name. What Joe Aitteon had called Ragmuff,
he called Paytaytequick, and said that it meant
Burnt Ground Stream. We stopped there, where I had
stopped before, and I bathed in this tributary. It was
shallow but cold, apparently too cold for the Indian, who
stood looking on. As we were pushing away again, a
white-headed eagle sailed over our heads. A reach some
miles above Pine Stream, where there were several
islands, the Indian said was Nonglangyis Deadwater.
Pine Stream he called Black River, and said that its
Indian name was Karsaootuk. He could go to Caribou
Lake that way.

We carried a part of the baggage about Pine Stream
Falls, while the Indian went down in the canoe. A
Bangor merchant had told us that two men in his employ
were drowned some time ago while passing these falls in
a batteau, and a third clung to a rock all night, and was
taken off in the morning. There were magnificent great
purple fringed orchises on this carry and the neighboring
shores. I measured the largest canoe birch which I saw
217
in this journey near the end of the carry. It was 14½
feet in circumference at two feet from the ground, but
at five feet divided into three parts. The canoe birches
thereabouts were commonly marked by conspicuous
dark spiral ridges, with a groove between, so that I
thought at first that they had been struck by lightning,
but, as the Indian said, it was evidently caused by the
grain of the tree. He cut a small, woody knob, as big as a
filbert, from the trunk of a fir, apparently an old balsam
vesicle filled with wood, which he said was good medicine.

After we had embarked and gone half a mile, my companion
remembered that he had left his knife, and we
paddled back to get it, against the strong and swift current.
This taught us the difference between going up and
down the stream, for while we were working our way
back a quarter of a mile, we should have gone down a
mile and a half at least. So we landed, and while he and
the Indian were gone back for it, I watched the motions
of the foam, a kind of white water-fowl near the shore,
forty or fifty rods below. It alternately appeared and
disappeared behind the rock, being carried round by an
eddy. Even this semblance of life was interesting on
that lonely river.

Immediately below these falls was the Chesuncook
Deadwater, caused by the flowing back of the lake. As
we paddled slowly over this, the Indian told us a story
of his hunting thereabouts, and something more interesting
about himself. It appeared that he had represented
his tribe at Augusta, and also once at Washington,
where he had met some Western chiefs. He had
been consulted at Augusta, and gave advice, which he
218
said was followed, respecting the eastern boundary of
Maine, as determined by highlands and streams, at the
time of the difficulties on that side. He was employed with
the surveyors on the line. Also he had called on Daniel
Webster in Boston, at the time of his Bunker Hill oration.

I was surprised to hear him say that he liked to go to
Boston, New York, Philadelphia, etc., etc.; that he
would like to live there. But then, as if relenting a little,
when he thought what a poor figure he would make
there, he added, "I suppose, I live in New York, I be
poorest hunter, I expect." He understood very well both
his superiority and his inferiority to the whites. He criticised
the people of the United States as compared with
other nations, but the only distinct idea with which he
labored was, that they were "very strong," but, like
some individuals, "too fast." He must have the credit of
saying this just before the general breaking down of railroads
and banks. He had a great idea of education, and
would occasionally break out into such expressions as
this, "Kademy&mdash;a-cad-e-my&mdash;good thing&mdash;I suppose
they usum Fifth Reader there.... You been college?"

From this deadwater the outlines of the mountains
about Ktaadn were visible. The top of Ktaadn was concealed
by a cloud, but the Souneunk Mountains were
nearer, and quite visible. We steered across the northwest
end of the lake, from which we looked down south-southeast,
the whole length to Joe Merry Mountain,
seen over its extremity. It is an agreeable change to
cross a lake, after you have been shut up in the woods,
not only on account of the greater expanse of water, but
also of sky. It is one of the surprises which Nature has in
219
store for the traveler in the forest. To look down, in this
case, over eighteen miles of water, was liberating and
civilizing even. No doubt, the short distance to which
you can see in the woods, and the general twilight, would
at length react on the inhabitants, and make them salvages.
The lakes also reveal the mountains, and give
ample scope and range to our thought. The very gulls
which we saw sitting on the rocks, like white specks, or
circling about, reminded me of custom-house officers.
Already there were half a dozen log huts about this end
of the lake, though so far from a road. I perceive that in
these woods the earliest settlements are, for various
reasons, clustering about the lakes, but partly, I think,
for the sake of the neighborhood as the oldest clearings.
They are forest schools already established,&mdash;great
centres of light. Water is a pioneer which the settler
follows, taking advantage of its improvements.

Thus far only I had been before. About noon we
turned northward, up a broad kind of estuary, and at its
northeast corner found the Caucomgomoc River, and
after going about a mile from the lake, reached the
Umbazookskus, which comes in on the right at a point
where the former river, coming from the west, turns
short to the south. Our course was up the Umbazookskus,
but as the Indian knew of a good camping-place,
that is, a cool place where there were few mosquitoes
about half a mile farther up the Caucomgomoc, we went
thither. The latter river, judging from the map, is the
longer and principal stream, and, therefore, its name
must prevail below the junction. So quickly we changed
the civilizing sky of Chesuncook for the dark wood of
220
the Caucomgomoc. On reaching the Indian's camping-ground,
on the south side, where the bank was about a
dozen feet high, I read on the trunk of a fir tree, blazed
by an axe, an inscription in charcoal which had been left
by him. It was surmounted by a drawing of a bear paddling
a canoe, which he said was the sign which had been
used by his family always. The drawing, though rude,
could not be mistaken for anything but a bear, and he
doubted my ability to copy it. The inscription ran thus,
verbatim et literatim. I interline the English of his Indian
as he gave it to me.

This was one of his homes. I saw where he had sometimes
stretched his moose-hides on the opposite or
sunny north side of the river, where there was a narrow
meadow.

After we had selected a place for our camp, and kindled
our fire, almost exactly on the site of the Indian's
last camp here, he, looking up, observed, "That tree
danger." It was a dead part, more than a foot in diameter,
of a large canoe birch, which branched at the
ground. This branch, rising thirty feet or more, slanted
directly over the spot which we had chosen for our bed.
I told him to try it with his axe; but he could not shake
it perceptibly, and therefore seemed inclined to disregard
it, and my companion expressed his willingness to
run the risk. But it seemed to me that we should be
fools to lie under it, for though the lower part was firm,
the top, for aught we knew, might be just ready to fall,
and we should at any rate be very uneasy if the wind
arose in the night. It is a common accident for men
camping in the woods to be killed by a falling tree. So
the camp was moved to the other side of the fire.

It was, as usual, a damp and shaggy forest, that
Caucomgomoc one, and the most you knew about it
was, that on this side it stretched toward the settlements,
and on that to still more unfrequented regions.
You carried so much topography in your mind always,&mdash;and
sometimes it seemed to make a considerable
difference whether you sat or lay nearer the settlements,
or farther off, than your companions,&mdash;were the rear or
frontier man of the camp. But there is really the same
difference between our positions wherever we may be
222
camped, and some are nearer the frontiers on feather-beds
in the towns than others on fir twigs in the backwoods.

The Indian said that the Umbazookskus, being a
dead stream with broad meadows, was a good place for
moose, and he frequently came a-hunting here, being out
alone three weeks or more from Oldtown. He sometimes,
also, went a-hunting to the Seboois Lakes, taking
the stage, with his gun and ammunition, axe and blankets,
hard-bread and pork, perhaps for a hundred miles
of the way, and jumped off at the wildest place on the
road, where he was at once at home, and every rod was
a tavern-site for him. Then, after a short journey
through the woods, he would build a spruce-bark canoe
in one day, putting but few ribs into it, that it might be
light, and, after doing his hunting with it on the lakes,
would return with his furs the same way he had come.
Thus you have an Indian availing himself cunningly of
the advantages of civilization, without losing any of his
woodcraft, but proving himself the more successful
hunter for it.

This man was very clever and quick to learn anything
in his line. Our tent was of a kind new to him; but when
he had once seen it pitched, it was surprising how
quickly he would find and prepare the pole and forked
stakes to pitch it with, cutting and placing them right
the first time, though I am sure that the majority of
white men would have blundered several times.

This river came from Caucomgomoc Lake, about ten
miles farther up. Though it was sluggish here, there
were falls not far above us, and we saw the foam from
223
them go by from time to time. The Indian said that
Caucomgomoc meant Big-Gull Lake (i.&nbsp;e., herring gull,
I suppose), gomoc meaning lake. Hence this was Caucomgomoctook,
or the river from that lake. This was the
Penobscot Caucomgomoctook; there was another St.
John one not far north. He finds the eggs of this gull,
sometimes twenty together, as big as hen's eggs, on rocky
ledges on the west side of Millinocket River, for instance,
and eats them.

Now I thought I would observe how he spent his
Sunday. While I and my companion were looking about
at the trees and river, he went to sleep. Indeed, he
improved every opportunity to get a nap, whatever the
day.

Rambling about the woods at this camp, I noticed
that they consisted chiefly of firs, black spruce, and
some white, red maple, canoe birch, and, along the river,
the hoary alder (Alnus incana). I name them in the order
of their abundance. The Viburnum nudum was a common
shrub, and of smaller plants, there were the dwarf
cornel, great round-leaved orchis, abundant and in
bloom (a greenish-white flower growing in little communities),
Uvularia grandiflora, whose stem tasted like
a cucumber, Pyrola secunda, apparently the commonest
pyrola in those woods, now out of bloom, Pyrola elliptica,
and Chiogenes hispidula. The Clintonia borealis,
with ripe berries, was very abundant, and perfectly at
home there. Its leaves, disposed commonly in triangles
about its stem, were just as handsomely formed and
green, and its berries as blue and glossy, as if it grew by
some botanist's favorite path.
224

I could trace the outlines of large birches that had
fallen long ago, collapsed and rotted and turned to soil,
by faint yellowish-green lines of feather-like moss,
eighteen inches wide and twenty or thirty feet long,
crossed by other similar lines.

I heard a night-warbler, wood thrush, kingfisher,
tweezer-bird or parti-colored warbler, and a nighthawk.
I also heard and saw red squirrels, and heard a bullfrog.
The Indian said that he heard a snake.

Wild as it was, it was hard for me to get rid of the
associations of the settlements. Any steady and monotonous
sound, to which I did not distinctly attend, passed
for a sound of human industry. The waterfalls which I
heard were not without their dams and mills to my
imagination; and several times I found that I had been
regarding the steady rushing sound of the wind from
over the woods beyond the rivers as that of a train
of cars,&mdash;the cars at Quebec. Our minds anywhere,
when left to themselves, are always thus busily drawing
conclusions from false premises.

I asked the Indian to make us a sugar-bowl of birch
bark, which he did, using the great knife which dangled
in a sheath from his belt; but the bark broke at the
corners when he bent it up, and he said it was not good;
that there was a great difference in this respect between
the bark of one canoe birch and that of another, i.&nbsp;e.,
one cracked more easily than another. I used some thin
and delicate sheets of this bark which he split and cut,
in my flower-book; thinking it would be good to separate
the dried specimens from the green.

My companion, wishing to distinguish between the
225
black and white spruce, asked Polis to show him a twig
of the latter, which he did at once, together with the
black; indeed, he could distinguish them about as far
as he could see them; but as the two twigs appeared
very much alike, my companion asked the Indian to
point out the difference; whereupon the latter, taking
the twigs, instantly remarked, as he passed his hand over
them successively in a stroking manner, that the white
was rough (i.&nbsp;e., the needles stood up nearly perpendicular),
but the black smooth (i.&nbsp;e., as if bent or combed
down). This was an obvious difference, both to sight
and touch. However, if I remember rightly, this would
not serve to distinguish the white spruce from the light-colored
variety of the black.

I asked him to let me see him get some black spruce
root, and make some thread. Whereupon, without looking
up at the trees overhead, he began to grub in the
ground, instantly distinguishing the black spruce roots,
and cutting off a slender one, three or four feet long, and
as big as a pipe-stem, he split the end with his knife,
and, taking a half between the thumb and forefinger of
each hand, rapidly separated its whole length into two
equal semicylindrical halves; then giving me another
root, he said, "You try." But in my hands it immediately
ran off one side, and I got only a very short piece.
In short, though it looked very easy, I found that there
was a great art in splitting these roots. The split is skillfully
humored by bending short with this hand or that,
and so kept in the middle. He then took off the bark
from each half, pressing a short piece of cedar bark
against the convex side with both hands, while he drew
226
the root upward with his teeth. An Indian's teeth are
strong, and I noticed that he used his often where we
should have used a hand. They amounted to a third
hand. He thus obtained, in a moment, a very neat,
tough, and flexible string, which he could tie into a knot,
or make into a fish-line even. It is said that in Norway
and Sweden the roots of the Norway spruce (Abies
excelsa) are used in the same way for the same purpose.
He said that you would be obliged to give half a dollar
for spruce root enough for a canoe, thus prepared. He
had hired the sewing of his own canoe, though he made
all the rest. The root in his canoe was of a pale slate-color,
probably acquired by exposure to the weather,
or perhaps from being boiled in water first.

He had discovered the day before that his canoe
leaked a little, and said that it was owing to stepping
into it violently, which forced the water under the edge
of the horizontal seams on the side. I asked him where
he would get pitch to mend it with, for they commonly
use hard pitch, obtained of the whites at Oldtown. He
said that he could make something very similar, and
equally good, not of spruce gum, or the like, but of
material which we had with us; and he wished me to
guess what. But I could not, and he would not tell me,
though he showed me a ball of it when made, as big as a
pea, and like black pitch, saying, at last, that there were
some things which a man did not tell even his wife. It
may have been his own discovery. In Arnold's expedition
the pioneers used for their canoe "the turpentine of
the pine, and the scrapings of the pork-bag."

Being curious to see what kind of fishes there were
227
in this dark, deep, sluggish river, I cast in my line just
before night, and caught several small somewhat yellowish
sucker-like fishes, which the Indian at once rejected,
saying that they were michigan fish (i.&nbsp;e., soft and
stinking fish) and good for nothing. Also, he would not
touch a pout, which I caught, and said that neither
Indians nor whites thereabouts ever ate them, which I
thought was singular, since they are esteemed in Massachusetts,
and he had told me that he ate hedgehogs,
loons, etc. But he said that some small silvery fishes,
which I called white chivin, which were similar in size
and form to the first, were the best fish in the Penobscot
waters, and if I would toss them up the bank to him, he
would cook them for me. After cleaning them, not very
carefully, leaving the heads on, he laid them on the coals
and so broiled them.

Returning from a short walk, he brought a vine in his
hand, and asked me if I knew what it was, saying that
it made the best tea of anything in the woods. It was
the creeping snowberry (Chiogenes hispidula), which
was quite common there, its berries just grown. He
called it cowosnebagosar, which name implies that it
grows where old prostrate trunks have collapsed and
rotted. So we determined to have some tea made of this
to-night. It had a slight checkerberry flavor, and we
both agreed that it was really better than the black tea
which we had brought. We thought it quite a discovery,
and that it might well be dried, and sold in the shops. I,
for one, however, am not an old tea-drinker, and cannot
speak with authority to others. It would have been particularly
good to carry along for a cold drink during the
228
day, the water thereabouts being invariably warm. The
Indian said that they also used for tea a certain herb
which grew in low ground, which he did not find there,
and ledum, or Labrador tea, which I have since found
and tried in Concord; also hemlock leaves, the last
especially in the winter, when the other plants were
covered with snow; and various other things; but he
did not approve of arbor-vitæ, which I said I had drunk
in those woods. We could have had a new kind of tea
every night.

Just before night we saw a musquash (he did not say
muskrat), the only one we saw in this voyage, swimming
downward on the opposite side of the stream. The
Indian, wishing to get one to eat, hushed us, saying,
"Stop, me call 'em;" and, sitting flat on the bank, he
began to make a curious squeaking, wiry sound with his
lips, exerting himself considerably. I was greatly surprised,&mdash;thought
that I had at last got into the wilderness,
and that he was a wild man indeed, to be talking
to a musquash! I did not know which of the two was the
strangest to me. He seemed suddenly to have quite forsaken
humanity, and gone over to the musquash side.
The musquash, however, as near as I could see, did not
turn aside, though he may have hesitated a little, and the
Indian said that he saw our fire; but it was evident that
he was in the habit of calling the musquash to him, as he
said. An acquaintance of mine who was hunting moose
in those woods a month after this, tells me that his
Indian in this way repeatedly called the musquash
within reach of his paddle in the moonlight, and struck
at them.
229

The Indian said a particularly long prayer this Sunday
evening, as if to atone for working in the morning.


Monday, July 27.


Having rapidly loaded the canoe, which the Indian
always carefully attended to, that it might be well
trimmed, and each having taken a look, as usual, to
see that nothing was left, we set out again descending
the Caucomgomoc, and turning northeasterly up the
Umbazookskus. This name, the Indian said, meant
Much Meadow River. We found it a very meadowy
stream, and deadwater, and now very wide on account
of the rains, though, he said, it was sometimes quite narrow.
The space between the woods, chiefly bare meadow,
was from fifty to two hundred rods in breadth, and
is a rare place for moose. It reminded me of the Concord;
and what increased the resemblance was one old
musquash-house almost afloat.

In the water on the meadows grew sedges, wool-grass,
the common blue flag abundantly, its flower just showing
itself above the high water, as if it were a blue water-lily,
and higher in the meadows a great many clumps
of a peculiar narrow-leaved willow (Salix petiolaris),
which is common in our river meadows. It was the prevailing
one here, and the Indian said that the musquash
ate much of it; and here also grew the red osier (Cornus
stolonifera), its large fruit now whitish.

Though it was still early in the morning, we saw
nighthawks circling over the meadow, and as usual
heard the pepe (Muscicapa Cooperi), which is one of the
prevailing birds in these woods, and the robin.
230

It was unusual for the woods to be so distant from the
shore, and there was quite an echo from them, but when
I was shouting in order to awake it, the Indian reminded
me that I should scare the moose, which he was looking
out for, and which we all wanted to see. The word for
echo was Pockadunkquaywayle.

A broad belt of dead larch trees along the distant edge
of the meadow, against the forest on each side, increased
the usual wildness of the scenery. The Indian called
these juniper, and said that they had been killed by
the backwater caused by the dam at the outlet of Chesuncook
Lake, some twenty miles distant. I plucked
at the water's edge the Asclepias incarnata, with quite
handsome flowers, a brighter red than our variety
(the pulchra). It was the only form of it which I saw
there.

Having paddled several miles up the Umbazookskus,
it suddenly contracted to a mere brook, narrow and
swift, the larches and other trees approaching the bank
and leaving no open meadow, and we landed to get a
black spruce pole for pushing against the stream. This
was the first occasion for one. The one selected was
quite slender, cut about ten feet long, merely whittled to
a point, and the bark shaved off. The stream, though
narrow and swift, was still deep, with a muddy bottom,
as I proved by diving to it. Beside the plants which I
have mentioned, I observed on the bank here the Salix
cordata and rostrata, Ranunculus recurvatus, and Rubus
triflorus with ripe fruit.

While we were thus employed, two Indians in a canoe
hove in sight round the bushes, coming down stream.
231
Our Indian knew one of them, an old man, and fell into
conversation with him in Indian. He belonged at the
foot of Moosehead. The other was of another tribe.
They were returning from hunting. I asked the younger
if they had seen any moose, to which he said no; but I,
seeing the moose-hides sticking out from a great bundle
made with their blankets in the middle of the canoe,
added, "Only their hides." As he was a foreigner, he
may have wished to deceive me, for it is against the law
for white men and foreigners to kill moose in Maine
at this season. But perhaps he need not have been
alarmed, for the moose-wardens are not very particular.
I heard quite directly of one who being asked by
a white man going into the woods what he would say if
he killed a moose, answered, "If you bring me a quarter
of it, I guess you won't be troubled." His duty being,
as he said, only to prevent the "indiscriminate" slaughter
of them for their hides. I suppose that he would consider
it an indiscriminate slaughter when a quarter was
not reserved for himself. Such are the perquisites of
this office.

We continued along through the most extensive larch
wood which I had seen,&mdash;tall and slender trees with
fantastic branches. But though this was the prevailing
tree here, I do not remember that we saw any afterward.
You do not find straggling trees of this species here and
there throughout the wood, but rather a little forest
of them. The same is the case with the white and red
pines, and some other trees, greatly to the convenience
of the lumberer. They are of a social habit, growing
in "veins," "clumps," "groups," or "communities," as
232
the explorers call them, distinguishing them far away,
from the top of a hill or a tree, the white pines towering
above the surrounding forest, or else they form extensive
forests by themselves. I should have liked to come
across a large community of pines, which had never
been invaded by the lumbering army.

We saw some fresh moose-tracks along the shore, but
the Indian said that the moose were not driven out of
the woods by the flies, as usual at this season, on account
of the abundance of water everywhere. The stream was
only from one and one half to three rods wide, quite
winding, with occasional small islands, meadows, and
some very swift and shallow places. When we came to
an island, the Indian never hesitated which side to take,
as if the current told him which was the shortest and
deepest. It was lucky for us that the water was so high.
We had to walk but once on this stream, carrying a part
of the load, at a swift and shallow reach, while he got up
with the canoe, not being obliged to take out, though he
said it was very strong water. Once or twice we passed
the red wreck of a batteau which had been stove some
spring.

While making this portage I saw many splendid specimens
of the great purple fringed orchis, three feet high.
It is remarkable that such delicate flowers should here
adorn these wilderness paths.

Having resumed our seats in the canoe, I felt the
Indian wiping my back, which he had accidentally spat
upon. He said it was a sign that I was going to be
married.

The Umbazookskus River is called ten miles long.
233
Having poled up the narrowest part some three or four
miles, the next opening in the sky was over Umbazookskus
Lake, which we suddenly entered about eleven
o'clock in the forenoon. It stretches northwesterly four
or five miles, with what the Indian called the Caucomgomoc
Mountain seen far beyond it. It was an agreeable
change.

This lake was very shallow a long distance from the
shore, and I saw stone-heaps on the bottom, like those
in the Assabet at home. The canoe ran into one. The
Indian thought that they were made by an eel. Joe
Aitteon in 1853 thought that they were made by chub.
We crossed the southeast end of the lake to the carry
into Mud Pond.

Umbazookskus Lake is the head of the Penobscot in
this direction, and Mud Pond is the nearest head of the
Allegash, one of the chief sources of the St. John. Hodge,
who went through this way to the St. Lawrence in the
service of the State, calls the portage here a mile and
three quarters long, and states that Mud Pond has been
found to be fourteen feet higher than Umbazookskus
Lake. As the West Branch of the Penobscot at the
Moosehead carry is considered about twenty-five feet
lower than Moosehead Lake, it appears that the Penobscot
in the upper part of its course runs in a broad and
shallow valley, between the Kennebec and St. John, and
lower than either of them, though, judging from the
map, you might expect it to be the highest.

Mud Pond is about halfway from Umbazookskus to
Chamberlain Lake, into which it empties, and to which
we were bound. The Indian said that this was the wettest
234
carry in the State, and as the season was a very wet
one, we anticipated an unpleasant walk. As usual he
made one large bundle of the pork-keg, cooking-utensils,
and other loose traps, by tying them up in his blanket.
We should be obliged to go over the carry twice, and our
method was to carry one half part way, and then go back
for the rest.

Our path ran close by the door of a log hut in a clearing
at this end of the carry, which the Indian, who alone
entered it, found to be occupied by a Canadian and his
family, and that the man had been blind for a year. He
seemed peculiarly unfortunate to be taken blind there,
where there were so few eyes to see for him. He could
not even be led out of that country by a dog, but must
be taken down the rapids as passively as a barrel of
flour. This was the first house above Chesuncook, and
the last on the Penobscot waters, and was built here, no
doubt, because it was the route of the lumberers in the
winter and spring.

After a slight ascent from the lake through the
springy soil of the Canadian's clearing, we entered on a
level and very wet and rocky path through the universal
dense evergreen forest, a loosely paved gutter merely,
where we went leaping from rock to rock and from side
to side, in the vain attempt to keep out of the water and
mud. We concluded that it was yet Penobscot water,
though there was no flow to it. It was on this carry that
the white hunter whom I met in the stage, as he told me,
had shot two bears a few months before. They stood
directly in the path, and did not turn out for him. They
might be excused for not turning out there, or only taking
235
the right as the law directs. He said that at this
season bears were found on the mountains and hillsides
in search of berries, and were apt to be saucy,&mdash;that
we might come across them up Trout Stream; and he
added, what I hardly credited, that many Indians slept
in their canoes, not daring to sleep on land, on account
of them.

Here commences what was called, twenty years ago,
the best timber land in the State. This very spot was
described as "covered with the greatest abundance of
pine," but now this appeared to me, comparatively, an
uncommon tree there,&mdash;and yet you did not see where
any more could have stood, amid the dense growth of
cedar, fir, etc. It was then proposed to cut a canal from
lake to lake here, but the outlet was finally made farther
east, at Telos Lake, as we shall see.

The Indian with his canoe soon disappeared before
us; but ere long he came back and told us to take a path
which turned off westward, it being better walking, and,
at my suggestion, he agreed to leave a bough in the regular
carry at that place, that we might not pass it by mistake.
Thereafter, he said, we were to keep the main
path, and he added, "You see 'em my tracks." But I
had not much faith that we could distinguish his tracks,
since others had passed over the carry within a few days.

We turned off at the right place, but were soon confused
by numerous logging-paths, coming into the one
we were on, by which lumberers had been to pick out
those pines which I have mentioned. However, we kept
what we considered the main path, though it was a winding
one, and in this, at long intervals, we distinguished a
236
faint trace of a footstep. This, though comparatively
unworn, was at first a better, or, at least, a drier road
than the regular carry which we had left. It led through
an arbor-vitæ wilderness of the grimmest character.
The great fallen and rotting trees had been cut through
and rolled aside, and their huge trunks abutted on the
path on each side, while others still lay across it two or
three feet high. It was impossible for us to discern the
Indian's trail in the elastic moss, which, like a thick
carpet, covered every rock and fallen tree, as well as the
earth. Nevertheless, I did occasionally detect the track
of a man, and I gave myself some credit for it. I carried
my whole load at once, a heavy knapsack, and a large
india-rubber bag, containing our bread and a blanket,
swung on a paddle; in all, about sixty pounds; but my
companion preferred to make two journeys, by short
stages, while I waited for him. We could not be sure that
we were not depositing our loads each time farther off
from the true path.

As I sat waiting for my companion, he would seem to
be gone a long time, and I had ample opportunity to
make observations on the forest. I now first began to be
seriously molested by the black fly, a very small but
perfectly formed fly of that color, about one tenth of an
inch long, which I first felt, and then saw, in swarms
about me, as I sat by a wider and more than usually
doubtful fork in this dark forest path. The hunters tell
bloody stories about them,&mdash;how they settle in a ring
about your neck, before you know it, and are wiped off
in great numbers with your blood. But remembering
that I had a wash in my knapsack, prepared by a
237
thoughtful hand in Bangor, I made haste to apply it to
my face and hands, and was glad to find it effectual,
as long as it was fresh, or for twenty minutes, not only
against black flies, but all the insects that molested us.
They would not alight on the part thus defended. It was
composed of sweet oil and oil of turpentine, with a little
oil of spearmint, and camphor. However, I finally concluded
that the remedy was worse than the disease. It
was so disagreeable and inconvenient to have your face
and hands covered with such a mixture.

Three large slate-colored birds of the jay genus
(Garrulus Canadensis), the Canada jay, moose-bird,
meat-bird, or what not, came flitting silently and by
degrees toward me, and hopped down the limbs inquisitively
to within seven or eight feet. They were more
clumsy and not nearly so handsome as the bluejay.
Fish hawks, from the lake, uttered their sharp whistling
notes low over the top of the forest near me, as if they
were anxious about a nest there.

After I had sat there some time, I noticed at this fork
in the path a tree which had been blazed, and the letters
"Chamb. L." written on it with red chalk. This I knew
to mean Chamberlain Lake. So I concluded that on the
whole we were on the right course, though as we had come
nearly two miles, and saw no signs of Mud Pond, I did
harbor the suspicion that we might be on a direct course
to Chamberlain Lake, leaving out Mud Pond. This I
found by my map would be about five miles northeasterly,
and I then took the bearing by my compass.

My companion having returned with his bag, and also
defended his face and hands with the insect-wash, we set
238
forward again. The walking rapidly grew worse, and the
path more indistinct, and at length, after passing through
a patch of Calla palustris, still abundantly in bloom,
we found ourselves in a more open and regular swamp,
made less passable than ordinary by the unusual wetness
of the season. We sank a foot deep in water and mud at
every step, and sometimes up to our knees, and the trail
was almost obliterated, being no more than that a musquash
leaves in similar places, when he parts the floating
sedge. In fact, it probably was a musquash trail in
some places. We concluded that if Mud Pond was as
muddy as the approach to it was wet, it certainly deserved
its name. It would have been amusing to behold
the dogged and deliberate pace at which we entered
that swamp, without interchanging a word, as if determined
to go through it, though it should come up to our
necks. Having penetrated a considerable distance into
this, and found a tussock on which we could deposit our
loads, though there was no place to sit, my companion
went back for the rest of his pack. I had thought to
observe on this carry when we crossed the dividing line
between the Penobscot and St. John, but as my feet had
hardly been out of water the whole distance, and it was
all level and stagnant, I began to despair of finding it.
I remembered hearing a good deal about the "highlands"
dividing the waters of the Penobscot from those
of the St. John, as well as the St. Lawrence, at the time
of the northeast boundary dispute, and I observed by
my map, that the line claimed by Great Britain as the
boundary prior to 1842 passed between Umbazookskus
Lake and Mud Pond, so that we had either crossed or
239
were then on it. These, then, according to her interpretation
of the treaty of '83, were the "highlands which
divide those rivers that empty themselves into the
St. Lawrence from those which fall into the Atlantic
Ocean." Truly an interesting spot to stand on,&mdash;if that
were it,&mdash;though you could not sit down there. I
thought that if the commissioners themselves, and the
King of Holland with them, had spent a few days here,
with their packs upon their backs, looking for that
"highland," they would have had an interesting time,
and perhaps it would have modified their views of the
question somewhat. The King of Holland would have
been in his element. Such were my meditations while
my companion was gone back for his bag.

It was a cedar swamp, through which the peculiar
note of the white-throated sparrow rang loud and clear.
There grew the side-saddle flower, Labrador tea,
Kalmia glauca, and, what was new to me, the low birch
(Betula pumila), a little round-leafed shrub, two or three
feet high only. We thought to name this swamp after the
latter.

After a long while my companion came back, and the
Indian with him. We had taken the wrong road, and
the Indian had lost us. He had very wisely gone back
to the Canadian's camp, and asked him which way we
had probably gone, since he could better understand the
ways of white men, and he told him correctly that we
had undoubtedly taken the supply road to Chamberlain
Lake (slender supplies they would get over such a road
at this season). The Indian was greatly surprised that
we should have taken what he called a "tow" (i.&nbsp;e., tote
240
or toting or supply) road, instead of a carry path,&mdash;that
we had not followed his tracks,&mdash;said it was "strange,"
and evidently thought little of our woodcraft.

Having held a consultation, and eaten a mouthful of
bread, we concluded that it would perhaps be nearer for
us two now to keep on to Chamberlain Lake, omitting
Mud Pond, than to go back and start anew for the last
place, though the Indian had never been through this
way, and knew nothing about it. In the meanwhile he
would go back and finish carrying over his canoe and
bundle to Mud Pond, cross that, and go down its outlet
and up Chamberlain Lake, and trust to meet us there
before night. It was now a little after noon. He supposed
that the water in which we stood had flowed back
from Mud Pond, which could not be far off eastward,
but was unapproachable through the dense cedar swamp.

Keeping on, we were ere long agreeably disappointed
by reaching firmer ground, and we crossed a ridge where
the path was more distinct, but there was never any outlook
over the forest. While descending the last, I saw
many specimens of the great round-leaved orchis, of
large size; one which I measured had leaves, as usual,
flat on the ground, nine and a half inches long, and nine
wide, and was two feet high. The dark, damp wilderness
is favorable to some of these orchidaceous plants, though
they are too delicate for cultivation. I also saw the
swamp gooseberry (Rides lacustre), with green fruit, and
in all the low ground, where it was not too wet, the Rubus
triflorus in fruit. At one place I heard a very clear and
piercing note from a small hawk, like a single note from
a white-throated sparrow, only very much louder, as he
241
dashed through the tree-tops over my head. I wondered
that he allowed himself to be disturbed by our presence,
since it seemed as if he could not easily find his nest
again himself in that wilderness. We also saw and heard
several times the red squirrel, and often, as before
observed, the bluish scales of the fir cones which it had
left on a rock or fallen tree. This, according to the
Indian, is the only squirrel found in those woods, except
a very few striped ones. It must have a solitary time in
that dark evergreen forest, where there is so little life,
seventy-five miles from a road as we had come. I wondered
how he could call any particular tree there his
home; and yet he would run up the stem of one out of
the myriads, as if it were an old road to him. How can a
hawk ever find him there? I fancied that he must be
glad to see us, though he did seem to chide us. One of
those sombre fir and spruce woods is not complete unless
you hear from out its cavernous mossy and twiggy
recesses his fine alarum,&mdash;his spruce voice, like the
working of the sap through some crack in a tree,&mdash;the
working of the spruce beer. Such an impertinent fellow
would occasionally try to alarm the wood about me.
"Oh," said I, "I am well acquainted with your family,
I know your cousins in Concord very well. Guess the
mail's irregular in these parts, and you'd like to hear
from 'em." But my overtures were vain, for he would
withdraw by his aerial turnpikes into a more distant
cedar-top, and spring his rattle again.

We then entered another swamp, at a necessarily
slow pace, where the walking was worse than ever,
not only on account of the water, but the fallen timber,
242
which often obliterated the indistinct trail entirely. The
fallen trees were so numerous, that for long distances the
route was through a succession of small yards, where we
climbed over fences as high as our heads, down into
water often up to our knees, and then over another fence
into a second yard, and so on; and, going back for his
bag, my companion once lost his way and came back
without it. In many places the canoe would have run if
it had not been for the fallen timber. Again it would be
more open, but equally wet, too wet for trees to grow,
and no place to sit down. It was a mossy swamp, which
it required the long legs of a moose to traverse, and it is
very likely that we scared some of them in our transit,
though we saw none. It was ready to echo the growl of
a bear, the howl of a wolf, or the scream of a panther;
but when you get fairly into the middle of one of these
grim forests, you are surprised to find that the larger
inhabitants are not at home commonly, but have left
only a puny red squirrel to bark at you. Generally
speaking, a howling wilderness does not howl: it is the
imagination of the traveler that does the howling. I did,
however, see one dead porcupine; perhaps he had succumbed
to the difficulties of the way. These bristly fellows
are a very suitable small fruit of such unkempt
wildernesses.

Making a logging-road in the Maine woods is called
"swamping" it, and they who do the work are called
"swampers." I now perceived the fitness of the term.
This was the most perfectly swamped of all the roads I
ever saw. Nature must have cooperated with art here.
However, I suppose they would tell you that this name
243
took its origin from the fact that the chief work of roadmakers
in those woods is to make the swamps passable.
We came to a stream where the bridge, which had been
made of logs tied together with cedar bark, had been
broken up, and we got over as we could. This probably
emptied into Mud Pond, and perhaps the Indian might
have come up it and taken us in there if he had known it.
Such as it was, this ruined bridge was the chief evidence
that we were on a path of any kind.

We then crossed another low rising ground, and I,
who wore shoes, had an opportunity to wring out my
stockings, but my companion, who used boots, had
found that this was not a safe experiment for him, for he
might not be able to get his wet boots on again. He went
over the whole ground, or water, three times, for which
reason our progress was very slow; beside that the
water softened our feet, and to some extent unfitted
them for walking. As I sat waiting for him, it would
naturally seem an unaccountable time that he was gone.
Therefore, as I could see through the woods that the sun
was getting low, and it was uncertain how far the lake
might be, even if we were on the right course, and in
what part of the world we should find ourselves at nightfall,
I proposed that I should push through with what
speed I could, leaving boughs to mark my path, and
find the lake and the Indian, if possible, before night,
and send the latter back to carry my companion's bag.

Having gone about a mile, and got into low ground
again, I heard a noise like the note of an owl, which I
soon discovered to be made by the Indian, and, answering
him, we soon came together. He had reached the
244
lake, after crossing Mud Pond, and running some rapids
below it, and had come up about a mile and a half on
our path. If he had not come back to meet us, we probably
should not have found him that night, for the path
branched once or twice before reaching this particular
part of the lake. So he went back for my companion and
his bag, while I kept on. Having waded through another
stream, where the bridge of logs had been broken up and
half floated away,&mdash;and this was not altogether worse
than our ordinary walking, since it was less muddy,&mdash;we
continued on, through alternate mud and water, to
the shore of Apmoojenegamook Lake, which we reached
in season for a late supper, instead of dining there, as we
had expected, having gone without our dinner. It was at
least five miles by the way we had come, and as my companion
had gone over most of it three times, he had
walked full a dozen miles, bad as it was. In the winter,
when the water is frozen, and the snow is four feet deep,
it is no doubt a tolerable path to a footman. As it was, I
would not have missed that walk for a good deal. If you
want an exact recipe for making such a road, take one
part Mud Pond, and dilute it with equal parts of Umbazookskus
and Apmoojenegamook; then send a family
of musquash through to locate it, look after the grades
and culverts, and finish it to their minds, and let a hurricane
follow to do the fencing.

We had come out on a point extending into Apmoojenegamook,
or Chamberlain Lake, west of the outlet
of Mud Pond, where there was a broad, gravelly, and
rocky shore, encumbered with bleached logs and trees.
We were rejoiced to see such dry things in that part of the
245
world. But at first we did not attend to dryness so much
as to mud and wetness. We all three walked into the
lake up to our middle to wash our clothes.

This was another noble lake, called twelve miles long,
east and west; if you add Telos Lake, which, since the
dam was built, has been connected with it by dead
water, it will be twenty; and it is apparently from a
mile and a half to two miles wide. We were about midway
its length, on the south side. We could see the only
clearing in these parts, called the "Chamberlain Farm,"
with two or three log buildings close together, on the
opposite shore, some two and a half miles distant. The
smoke of our fire on the shore brought over two men in
a canoe from the farm, that being a common signal
agreed on when one wishes to cross. It took them about
half an hour to come over, and they had their labor
for their pains this time. Even the English name of the
lake had a wild, woodland sound, reminding me of
that Chamberlain who killed Paugus at Lovewell's
fight.

After putting on such dry clothes as we had, and
hanging the others to dry on the pole which the Indian
arranged over the fire, we ate our supper, and lay down
on the pebbly shore with our feet to the fire, without
pitching our tent, making a thin bed of grass to cover
the stones.

Here first I was molested by the little midge called the
no-see-em (Simulium nocivum,&mdash;the latter word is not
the Latin for no-see-em), especially over the sand at the
water's edge, for it is a kind of sand-fly. You would not
observe them but for their light-colored wings. They are
246
said to get under your clothes, and produce a feverish
heat, which I suppose was what I felt that night.

Our insect foes in this excursion, to sum them up,
were, first, mosquitoes, the chief ones, but only troublesome
at night, or when we sat still on shore by day;
second, black flies (Simulium molestum), which molested
us more or less on the carries by day, as I have
before described, and sometimes in narrower parts of
the stream. Harris mistakes when he says that they are
not seen after June. Third, moose-flies. The big ones,
Polis said, were called Bososquasis. It is a stout, brown
fly, much like a horse-fly, about eleven sixteenths of
an inch long, commonly rusty-colored beneath, with
unspotted wings. They can bite smartly, according to
Polis, but are easily avoided or killed. Fourth, the no-see-ems
above mentioned. Of all these, the mosquitoes
are the only ones that troubled me seriously; but, as I
was provided with a wash and a veil, they have not made
any deep impression.

The Indian would not use our wash to protect his face
and hands, for fear that it would hurt his skin, nor had
he any veil; he, therefore, suffered from insects now,
and throughout this journey, more than either of us. I
think that he suffered more than I did, when neither of
us was protected. He regularly tied up his face in his
handkerchief, and buried it in his blanket, and he now
finally lay down on the sand between us and the fire for
the sake of the smoke, which he tried to make enter his
blanket about his face, and for the same purpose he lit
his pipe and breathed the smoke into his blanket.

As we lay thus on the shore, with nothing between us
247
and the stars, I inquired what stars he was acquainted
with, or had names for. They were the Great Bear,
which he called by this name, the Seven Stars, which he
had no English name for, "the morning star," and "the
north star."

In the middle of the night, as indeed each time that
we lay on the shore of a lake, we heard the voice of the
loon, loud and distinct, from far over the lake. It is a
very wild sound, quite in keeping with the place and the
circumstances of the traveler, and very unlike the voice
of a bird. I could lie awake for hours listening to it, it is
so thrilling. When camping in such a wilderness as this,
you are prepared to hear sounds from some of its inhabitants
which will give voice to its wildness. Some idea of
bears, wolves, or panthers runs in your head naturally,
and when this note is first heard very far off at midnight,
as you lie with your ear to the ground,&mdash;the forest
being perfectly still about you, you take it for granted
that it is the voice of a wolf or some other wild beast,
for only the last part is heard when at a distance,&mdash;you
conclude that it is a pack of wolves, baying the moon, or,
perchance, cantering after a moose. Strange as it may
seem, the "mooing" of a cow on a mountain-side comes
nearest to my idea of the voice of a bear; and this bird's
note resembled that. It was the unfailing and characteristic
sound of those lakes. We were not so lucky as to
hear wolves howl, though that is an occasional serenade.
Some friends of mine, who two years ago went up the
Caucomgomoc River, were serenaded by wolves while
moose-hunting by moonlight. It was a sudden burst, as
if a hundred demons had broke loose,&mdash;a startling
248
sound enough, which, if any, would make your hair
stand on end, and all was still again. It lasted but a
moment, and you'd have thought there were twenty of
them, when probably there were only two or three. They
heard it twice only, and they said that it gave expression
to the wilderness which it lacked before. I heard of some
men who, while skinning a moose lately in those woods,
were driven off from the carcass by a pack of wolves,
which ate it up.

This of the loon&mdash;I do not mean its laugh, but its
looning,&mdash;is a long-drawn call, as it were, sometimes
singularly human to my ear,&mdash;hoo-hoo-ooooo, like the
hallooing of a man on a very high key, having thrown
his voice into his head. I have heard a sound exactly
like it when breathing heavily through my own nostrils,
half awake at ten at night, suggesting my affinity to the
loon; as if its language were but a dialect of my own,
after all. Formerly, when lying awake at midnight in
those woods, I had listened to hear some words or syllables
of their language, but it chanced that I listened in
vain until I heard the cry of the loon. I have heard it
occasionally on the ponds of my native town, but there
its wildness is not enhanced by the surrounding scenery.

I was awakened at midnight by some heavy, low-flying
bird, probably a loon, flapping by close over my
head, along the shore. So, turning the other side of my
half-clad body to the fire, I sought slumber again.


Tuesday, July 28.


When we awoke, we found a heavy dew on our blankets.
I lay awake very early, and listened to the clear,
249
shrill ah, te te, te te, te of the white-throated sparrow,
repeated at short intervals, without the least variation,
for half an hour, as if it could not enough express its
happiness. Whether my companions heard it or not, I
know not, but it was a kind of matins to me, and the
event of that forenoon.

It was a pleasant sunrise, and we had a view of the
mountains in the southeast. Ktaadn appeared about
southeast by south. A double-topped mountain, about
southeast by east, and another portion of the same, east-southeast.
The last the Indian called Nerlumskeechticook,
and said that it was at the head of the East Branch,
and we should pass near it on our return that way.

We did some more washing in the lake this morning,
and with our clothes hung about on the dead trees and
rocks, the shore looked like washing-day at home. The
Indian, taking the hint, borrowed the soap, and, walking
into the lake, washed his only cotton shirt on his
person, then put on his pants and let it dry on him.

I observed that he wore a cotton shirt, originally
white, a greenish flannel one over it, but no waistcoat,
flannel drawers, and strong linen or duck pants, which
also had been white, blue woolen stockings, cowhide
boots, and a Kossuth hat. He carried no change of
clothing, but putting on a stout, thick jacket, which he
laid aside in the canoe, and seizing a full-sized axe, his
gun and ammunition, and a blanket, which would do for
a sail or knapsack, if wanted, and strapping on his belt,
which contained a large sheath-knife, he walked off at
once, ready to be gone all summer. This looked very
independent; a few simple and effective tools, and no
250
india-rubber clothing. He was always the first ready to
start in the morning, and if it had not held some of our
property, would not have been obliged to roll up his
blanket. Instead of carrying a large bundle of his own
extra clothing, etc., he brought back the greatcoats of
moose tied up in his blanket. I found that his outfit was
the result of a long experience, and in the main hardly
to be improved on, unless by washing and an extra shirt.
Wanting a button here, he walked off to a place where
some Indians had recently encamped, and searched for
one, but I believe in vain.

Having softened our stiffened boots and shoes with
the pork fat, the usual disposition of what was left at
breakfast, we crossed the lake early, steering in a diagonal
direction, northeasterly about four miles, to the outlet,
which was not to be discovered till we were close to
it. The Indian name, Apmoojenegamook, means lake
that is crossed, because the usual course lies across, and
not along it. This is the largest of the Allegash lakes,
and was the first St. John water that we floated on. It
is shaped in the main like Chesuncook. There are no
mountains or high hills very near it. At Bangor we had
been told of a township many miles farther northwest;
it was indicated to us as containing the highest land
thereabouts, where, by climbing a particular tree in the
forest, we could get a general idea of the country. I have
no doubt that the last was good advice, but we did not
go there. We did not intend to go far down the Allegash,
but merely to get a view of the great lakes which
are its source, and then return this way to the East
Branch of the Penobscot. The water now, by good
251
rights, flowed northward, if it could be said to flow at all.

After reaching the middle of the lake, we found the
waves as usual pretty high, and the Indian warned my
companion, who was nodding, that he must not allow
himself to fall asleep in the canoe lest he should upset us;
adding, that when Indians want to sleep in a canoe, they
lie down straight on the bottom. But in this crowded one
that was impossible. However, he said that he would
nudge him if he saw him nodding.

A belt of dead trees stood all around the lake, some
far out in the water, with others prostrate behind them,
and they made the shore, for the most part, almost inaccessible.
This is the effect of the dam at the outlet. Thus
the natural sandy or rocky shore, with its green fringe,
was concealed and destroyed. We coasted westward
along the north side, searching for the outlet, about one
quarter of a mile distant from this savage-looking shore,
on which the waves were breaking violently, knowing
that it might easily be concealed amid this rubbish, or by
the overlapping of the shore. It is remarkable how little
these important gates to a lake are blazoned. There is
no triumphal arch over the modest inlet or outlet, but at
some undistinguished point it trickles in or out through
the uninterrupted forest, almost as through a sponge.

We reached the outlet in about an hour, and carried
over the dam there, which is quite a solid structure, and
about one quarter of a mile farther there was a second
dam. The reader will perceive that the result of this
particular damming about Chamberlain Lake is, that
the head-waters of the St. John are made to flow by
Bangor. They have thus dammed all the larger lakes,
252
raising their broad surfaces many feet; Moosehead, for
instance, some forty miles long, with its steamer on it;
thus turning the forces of nature against herself, that
they might float their spoils out of the country. They
rapidly run out of these immense forests all the finer,
and more accessible pine timber, and then leave the
bears to watch the decaying dams, not clearing nor cultivating
the land, nor making roads, nor building
houses, but leaving it a wilderness as they found it. In
many parts, only these dams remain, like deserted
beaver-dams. Think how much land they have flowed,
without asking Nature's leave! When the State wishes
to endow an academy or university, it grants it a tract
of forest land: one saw represents an academy; a gang,
a university.

The wilderness experiences a sudden rise of all her
streams and lakes. She feels ten thousand vermin gnawing
at the base of her noblest trees. Many combining
drag them off, jarring over the roots of the survivors,
and tumble them into the nearest stream, till, the fairest
having fallen, they scamper off to ransack some new
wilderness, and all is still again. It is as when a migrating
army of mice girdles a forest of pines. The chopper
fells trees from the same motive that the mouse gnaws
them,&mdash;to get his living. You tell me that he has a
more interesting family than the mouse. That is as it
happens. He speaks of a "berth" of timber, a good
place for him to get into, just as a worm might. When
the chopper would praise a pine, he will commonly tell
you that the one he cut was so big that a yoke of oxen
stood on its stump; as if that were what the pine had
253
grown for, to become the footstool of oxen. In my
mind's eye, I can see these unwieldy tame deer, with a
yoke binding them together, and brazen-tipped horns
betraying their servitude, taking their stand on the
stump of each giant pine in succession throughout this
whole forest, and chewing their cud there, until it is
nothing but an ox-pasture, and run out at that. As if
it were good for the oxen, and some terebinthine or
other medicinal quality ascended into their nostrils. Or
is their elevated position intended merely as a symbol of
the fact that the pastoral comes next in order to the
sylvan or hunter life?

The character of the logger's admiration is betrayed
by his very mode of expressing it. If he told all that was
in his mind, he would say, it was so big that I cut it down
and then a yoke of oxen could stand on its stump. He
admires the log, the carcass or corpse, more than the
tree. Why, my dear sir, the tree might have stood on its
own stump, and a great deal more comfortably and
firmly than a yoke of oxen can, if you had not cut it
down. What right have you to celebrate the virtues of
the man you murdered?

The Anglo-American can indeed cut down, and grub
up all this waving forest, and make a stump speech, and
vote for Buchanan on its ruins, but he cannot converse
with the spirit of the tree he fells, he cannot read the
poetry and mythology which retire as he advances. He
ignorantly erases mythological tablets in order to print
his handbills and town-meeting warrants on them.
Before he has learned his a&nbsp;&nbsp;b&nbsp;&nbsp;c in the beautiful but
mystic lore of the wilderness which Spenser and Dante
254
had just begun to read, he cuts it down, coins a pine-tree
shilling (as if to signify the pine's value to him), puts
up a deestrict schoolhouse, and introduces Webster's
spelling-book.

Below the last dam, the river being swift and shallow,
though broad enough, we two walked about half a mile
to lighten the canoe. I made it a rule to carry my knapsack
when I walked, and also to keep it tied to a crossbar
when in the canoe, that it might be found with the
canoe if we should upset.

I heard the dog-day locust here, and afterward on the
carries, a sound which I had associated only with more
open, if not settled countries. The area for locusts must
be small in the Maine woods.

We were now fairly on the Allegash River, which
name our Indian said meant hemlock bark. These
waters flow northward about one hundred miles, at first
very feebly, then southeasterly two hundred and fifty
more to the Bay of Fundy. After perhaps two miles of
river, we entered Heron Lake, called on the map Pongokwahem,
scaring up forty or fifty young shecorways, sheldrakes,
at the entrance, which ran over the water with
great rapidity, as usual in a long line.

This was the fourth great lake, lying northwest and
southeast, like Chesuncook and most of the long lakes
in that neighborhood, and, judging from the map, it is
about ten miles long. We had entered it on the southwest
side, and saw a dark mountain northeast over the
lake, not very far off nor high, which the Indian said was
called Peaked Mountain, and used by explorers to look
for timber from. There was also some other high land
255
more easterly. The shores were in the same ragged and
unsightly condition, encumbered with dead timber, both
fallen and standing, as in the last lake, owing to the dam
on the Allegash below. Some low points or islands were
almost drowned.

I saw something white a mile off on the water, which
turned out to be a great gull on a rock in the middle,
which the Indian would have been glad to kill and eat,
but it flew away long before we were near; and also a
flock of summer ducks that were about the rock with it.
I asking him about herons, since this was Heron Lake,
he said that he found the blue heron's nests in the hardwood
trees. I thought that I saw a light-colored object
move along the opposite or northern shore, four or five
miles distant. He did not know what it could be, unless
it were a moose, though he had never seen a white one;
but he said that he could distinguish a moose "anywhere
on shore, clear across the lake."

Rounding a point, we stood across a bay for a mile
and a half or two miles, toward a large island, three or
four miles down the lake. We met with ephemeræ (shadfly)
midway, about a mile from the shore, and they
evidently fly over the whole lake. On Moosehead I had
seen a large devil's-needle half a mile from the shore,
coming from the middle of the lake, where it was three
or four miles wide at least. It had probably crossed. But
at last, of course, you come to lakes so large that an
insect cannot fly across them; and this, perhaps, will
serve to distinguish a large lake from a small one.

We landed on the southeast side of the island, which
was rather elevated and densely wooded, with a rocky
256
shore, in season for an early dinner. Somebody had
camped there not long before, and left the frame on
which they stretched a moose-hide, which our Indian
criticised severely, thinking it showed but little woodcraft.
Here were plenty of the shells of crayfish, or fresh-water
lobsters, which had been washed ashore, such as
have given a name to some ponds and streams. They
are commonly four or five inches long. The Indian proceeded
at once to cut a canoe birch, slanted it up against
another tree on the shore, tying it with a withe, and lay
down to sleep in its shade.

When we were on the Caucomgomoc, he recommended
to us a new way home, the very one which we
had first thought of, by the St. John. He even said that
it was easier, and would take but little more time than
the other, by the East Branch of the Penobscot, though
very much farther round; and taking the map, he
showed where we should be each night, for he was
familiar with the route. According to his calculation,
we should reach the French settlements the next night
after this, by keeping northward down the Allegash, and
when we got into the main St. John the banks would be
more or less settled all the way; as if that were a recommendation.
There would be but one or two falls, with
short carrying-places, and we should go down the stream
very fast, even a hundred miles a day, if the wind
allowed; and he indicated where we should carry over
into Eel River to save a bend below Woodstock in New
Brunswick, and so into the Schoodic Lake, and thence
to the Mattawamkeag. It would be about three hundred
and sixty miles to Bangor this way, though only about
257
one hundred and sixty by the other; but in the former
case we should explore the St. John from its source
through two thirds of its course, as well as the Schoodic
Lake and Mattawamkeag,&mdash;and we were again tempted
to go that way. I feared, however, that the banks of
the St. John were too much settled. When I asked
him which course would take us through the wildest
country, he said the route by the East Branch. Partly
from this consideration, as also from its shortness, we
resolved to adhere to the latter route, and perhaps ascend
Ktaadn on the way. We made this island the limit of
our excursion in this direction.

We had now seen the largest of the Allegash lakes.
The next dam "was about fifteen miles" farther north,
down the Allegash, and it was dead water so far. We
had been told in Bangor of a man who lived alone, a sort
of hermit, at that dam, to take care of it, who spent his
time tossing a bullet from one hand to the other, for
want of employment,&mdash;as if we might want to call on
him. This sort of tit-for-tat intercourse between his two
hands, bandying to and fro a leaden subject, seems to
have been his symbol for society.

This island, according to the map, was about a hundred
and ten miles in a straight line north-northwest
from Bangor, and about ninety-nine miles east-southeast
from Quebec. There was another island visible
toward the north end of the lake, with an elevated clearing
on it; but we learned afterward that it was not
inhabited, had only been used as a pasture for cattle
which summered in these woods, though our informant
said that there was a hut on the mainland near the outlet
258
of the lake. This unnaturally smooth-shaven, squarish
spot, in the midst of the otherwise uninterrupted forest,
only reminded us how uninhabited the country was.
You would sooner expect to meet with a bear than an ox
in such a clearing. At any rate, it must have been a surprise
to the bears when they came across it. Such, seen
far or near, you know at once to be man's work, for
Nature never does it. In order to let in the light to the
earth as on a lake, he clears off the forest on the hillsides
and plains, and sprinkles fine grass seed, like an enchanter,
and so carpets the earth with a firm sward.

Polis had evidently more curiosity respecting the few
settlers in those woods than we. If nothing was said, he
took it for granted that we wanted to go straight to the
next log-hut. Having observed that we came by the log
huts at Chesuncook, and the blind Canadian's at the
Mud Pond carry, without stopping to communicate
with the inhabitants, he took occasion now to suggest
that the usual way was, when you came near a house, to
go to it, and tell the inhabitants what you had seen or
heard, and then they tell you what they had seen; but
we laughed, and said that we had had enough of houses
for the present, and had come here partly to avoid them.

In the meanwhile, the wind, increasing, blew down
the Indian's birch, and created such a sea that we found
ourselves prisoners on the island, the nearest shore,
which was the western, being perhaps a mile distant,
and we took the canoe out to prevent its drifting away.
We did not know but we should be compelled to spend
the rest of the day and the night there. At any rate, the
Indian went to sleep again in the shade of his birch, my
259
companion busied himself drying his plants, and I
rambled along the shore westward, which was quite
stony, and obstructed with fallen, bleached, or drifted
trees for four or five rods in width. I found growing on
this broad, rocky, and gravelly shore the Salix rostrata,
discolor, and lucida, Ranunculus recurvatus, Potentilla
Norvegica, Scutellaria lateriflora, Eupatorium purpureum,
Aster Tradescanti, Mentha Canadensis, Epilobium
angustifolium (abundant), Lycopus sinuatus, Solidago
lanceolata, Spiræa salicifolia, Antennaria margaraticea,
Prunella, Rumex Acetosella, raspberries, wool-grass,
Onoclea, etc. The nearest trees were Betula papyracea
and excelsa, and Populus tremuloides. I give these
names because it was my farthest northern point.

Our Indian said that he was a doctor, and could tell
me some medicinal use for every plant I could show
him. I immediately tried him. He said that the inner
bark of the aspen (Populus tremuloides) was good for
sore eyes; and so with various other plants, proving
himself as good as his word. According to his account,
he had acquired such knowledge in his youth from a
wise old Indian with whom he associated, and he
lamented that the present generation of Indians "had
lost a great deal."

He said that the caribou was a "very great runner,"
that there was none about this lake now, though there
used to be many, and pointing to the belt of dead trees
caused by the dams, he added, "No likum stump,&mdash;when
he sees that he scared."

Pointing southeasterly over the lake and distant
forest, he observed, "Me go Oldtown in three days." I
260
asked how he would get over the swamps and fallen
trees. "Oh," said he, "in winter all covered, go anywhere
on snowshoes, right across lakes." When I asked
how he went, he said, "First I go Ktaadn, west side,
then I go Millinocket, then Pamadumcook, then Nicketow,
then Lincoln, then Oldtown," or else he went a
shorter way by the Piscataquis. What a wilderness walk
for a man to take alone! None of your half-mile swamps,
none of your mile-wide woods merely, as on the skirts
of our towns, without hotels, only a dark mountain or a
lake for guide-board and station, over ground much of it
impassable in summer!

It reminded me of Prometheus Bound. Here was
traveling of the old heroic kind over the unaltered face
of nature. From the Allegash, or Hemlock River, and
Pongoquahem Lake, across great Apmoojenegamook,
and leaving the Nerlumskeechticook Mountain on his
left, he takes his way under the bear-haunted slopes of
Souneunk and Ktaadn Mountains to Pamadumcook,
and Millinocket's inland seas (where often gulls'-eggs
may increase his store), and so on to the forks of the
Nicketow (niasoseb, "we alone Joseph," seeing what our
folks see), ever pushing the boughs of the fir and spruce
aside, with his load of furs, contending day and night,
night and day, with the shaggy demon vegetation, traveling
through the mossy graveyard of trees. Or he could
go by "that rough tooth of the sea," Kineo, great source
of arrows and of spears to the ancients, when weapons of
stone were used. Seeing and hearing moose, caribou,
bears, porcupines, lynxes, wolves, and panthers. Places
where he might live and die and never hear of the
261
United States, which make such a noise in the world,&mdash;never
hear of America, so called from the name of a
European gentleman.

There is a lumberer's road called the Eagle Lake
road, from the Seboois to the east side of this lake. It
may seem strange that any road through such a wilderness
should be passable, even in winter, when the snow
is three or four feet deep, but at that season, wherever
lumbering operations are actively carried on, teams are
continually passing on the single track, and it becomes
as smooth almost as a railway. I am told that in the
Aroostook country the sleds are required by law to be
of one width (four feet), and sleighs must be altered to
fit the track, so that one runner may go in one rut and
the other follow the horse. Yet it is very bad turning out.

We had for some time seen a thunder-shower coming
up from the west over the woods of the island, and heard
the muttering of the thunder, though we were in doubt
whether it would reach us; but now the darkness rapidly
increasing, and a fresh breeze rustling the forest, we
hastily put up the plants which we had been drying, and
with one consent made a rush for the tent material and
set about pitching it. A place was selected and stakes
and pins cut in the shortest possible time, and we were
pinning it down lest it should be blown away, when the
storm suddenly burst over us.

As we lay huddled together under the tent, which
leaked considerably about the sides, with our baggage
at our feet, we listened to some of the grandest thunder
which I ever heard,&mdash;rapid peals, round and plump,
bang, bang, bang, in succession, like artillery from some
262
fortress in the sky; and the lightning was proportionally
brilliant. The Indian said, "It must be good powder."
All for the benefit of the moose and us, echoing far over
the concealed lakes. I thought it must be a place which
the thunder loved, where the lightning practiced to keep
its hand in, and it would do no harm to shatter a few
pines. What had become of the ephemeræ and devil's-needles
then? Were they prudent enough to seek harbor
before the storm? Perhaps their motions might guide
the voyageur.

Looking out I perceived that the violent shower
falling on the lake had almost instantaneously flattened
the waves,&mdash;the commander of that fortress had
smoothed it for us so,&mdash;and, it clearing off, we resolved
to start immediately, before the wind raised them again.

Going outside, I said that I saw clouds still in the
southwest, and heard thunder there. The Indian asked
if the thunder went "lound" (round), saying that if it did
we should have more rain. I thought that it did. We
embarked, nevertheless, and paddled rapidly back
toward the dams. The white-throated sparrows on the
shore were about, singing, Ah, te-e-e, te-e-e, te, or else
ah, te-e-e, te-e-e, te-e-e, te-e-e.

At the outlet of Chamberlain Lake we were overtaken
by another gusty rain-storm, which compelled us
to take shelter, the Indian under his canoe on the bank,
and we ran under the edge of the dam. However, we
were more scared than wet. From my covert I could see
the Indian peeping out from beneath his canoe to see
what had become of the rain. When we had taken our
respective places thus once or twice, the rain not coming
263
down in earnest, we commenced rambling about the
neighborhood, for the wind had by this time raised such
waves on the lake that we could not stir, and we feared
that we should be obliged to camp there. We got an
early supper on the dam and tried for fish there, while
waiting for the tumult to subside. The fishes were not
only few, but small and worthless, and the Indian
declared that there were no good fishes in the St. John's
waters; that we must wait till we got to the Penobscot
waters.

At length, just before sunset, we set out again. It
was a wild evening when we coasted up the north side
of this Apmoojenegamook Lake. One thunder-storm
was just over, and the waves which it had raised still
running with violence, and another storm was now seen
coming up in the southwest, far over the lake; but it
might be worse in the morning, and we wished to get as
far as possible on our way up the lake while we might.
It blowed hard against the northern shore about an
eighth of a mile distant on our left, and there was just
as much sea as our shallow canoe would bear, without
our taking unusual care. That which we kept off, and
toward which the waves were driving, was as dreary and
harborless a shore as you can conceive. For half a dozen
rods in width it was a perfect maze of submerged trees,
all dead and bare and bleaching, some standing half
their original height, others prostrate, and criss-across,
above or beneath the surface, and mingled with them
were loose trees and limbs and stumps, beating about.
Imagine the wharves of the largest city in the world,
decayed, and the earth and planking washed away,
264
leaving the spiles standing in loose order, but often of
twice the ordinary height, and mingled with and beating
against them the wreck of ten thousand navies, all their
spars and timbers, while there rises from the water's edge
the densest and grimmest wilderness, ready to supply
more material when the former fails, and you may get a
faint idea of that coast. We could not have landed if we
would, without the greatest danger of being swamped;
so blow as it might, we must depend on coasting by it.
It was twilight, too, and that stormy cloud was advancing
rapidly in our rear. It was a pleasant excitement,
yet we were glad to reach, at length, in the dusk, the
cleared shore of the Chamberlain Farm.

We landed on a low and thinly wooded point there,
and while my companions were pitching the tent, I ran
up to the house to get some sugar, our six pounds being
gone;&mdash;it was no wonder they were, for Polis had a
sweet tooth. He would first fill his dipper nearly a third
full of sugar, and then add the coffee to it. Here was a
clearing extending back from the lake to a hilltop, with
some dark-colored log buildings and a storehouse in it,
and half a dozen men standing in front of the principal
hut, greedy for news. Among them was the man who
tended the dam on the Allegash and tossed the bullet.
He having charge of the dams, and learning that we
were going to Webster Stream the next day, told me that
some of their men, who were haying at Telos Lake, had
shut the dam at the canal there in order to catch trout,
and if we wanted more water to take us through the
canal, we might raise the gate, for he would like to have
it raised. The Chamberlain Farm is no doubt a cheerful
265
opening in the woods, but such was the lateness of the
hour that it has left but a dusky impression on my mind.
As I have said, the influx of light merely is civilizing,
yet I fancied that they walked about on Sundays in their
clearing somewhat as in a prison-yard.

They were unwilling to spare more than four pounds
of brown sugar,&mdash;unlocking the storehouse to get it,&mdash;since
they only kept a little for such cases as this, and
they charged twenty cents a pound for it, which certainly
it was worth to get it up there.

When I returned to the shore it was quite dark, but
we had a rousing fire to warm and dry us by, and a snug
apartment behind it. The Indian went up to the house
to inquire after a brother who had been absent hunting
a year or two, and while another shower was beginning,
I groped about cutting spruce and arbor-vitæ twigs for a
bed. I preferred the arbor-vitæ on account of its fragrance,
and spread it particularly thick about the shoulders.
It is remarkable with what pure satisfaction the
traveler in these woods will reach his camping-ground
on the eve of a tempestuous night like this, as if he had
got to his inn, and, rolling himself in his blanket, stretch
himself on his six-feet-by-two bed of dripping fir twigs,
with a thin sheet of cotton for roof, snug as a meadow-mouse
in its nest. Invariably our best nights were those
when it rained, for then we were not troubled with
mosquitoes.

You soon come to disregard rain on such excursions,
at least in the summer, it is so easy to dry yourself, supposing
a dry change of clothing is not to be had. You
can much sooner dry you by such a fire as you can make
266
in the woods than in anybody's kitchen, the fireplace is
so much larger, and wood so much more abundant. A
shed-shaped tent will catch and reflect the heat like a
Yankee baker, and you may be drying while you are
sleeping.

Some who have leaky roofs in the towns may have
been kept awake, but we were soon lulled asleep by a
steady, soaking rain, which lasted all night. To-night,
the rain not coming at once with violence, the twigs were
soon dried by the reflected heat.


Wednesday, July 29.


When we awoke it had done raining, though it was
still cloudy. The fire was put out, and the Indian's
boots, which stood under the eaves of the tent, were half
full of water. He was much more improvident in such
respects than either of us, and he had to thank us for
keeping his powder dry. We decided to cross the lake
at once, before breakfast, or while we could; and before
starting I took the bearing of the shore which we wished
to strike, S. S. E. about three miles distant, lest a sudden
misty rain should conceal it when we were midway.
Though the bay in which we were was perfectly quiet
and smooth, we found the lake already wide awake outside,
but not dangerously or unpleasantly so; nevertheless,
when you get out on one of those lakes in a canoe
like this, you do not forget that you are completely at the
mercy of the wind, and a fickle power it is. The playful
waves may at any time become too rude for you in their
sport, and play right on over you. We saw a few shecorways
and a fish hawk thus early, and after much steady
267
paddling and dancing over the dark waves of Apmoojenegamook,
we found ourselves in the neighborhood of
the southern land, heard the waves breaking on it, and
turned our thoughts wholly to that side. After coasting
eastward along this shore a mile or two, we breakfasted
on a rocky point, the first convenient place that offered.

It was well enough that we crossed thus early, for the
waves now ran quite high, and we should have been
obliged to go round somewhat, but beyond this point we
had comparatively smooth water. You can commonly go
along one side or the other of a lake, when you cannot
cross it.

The Indian was looking at the hard-wood ridges from
time to time, and said that he would like to buy a few
hundred acres somewhere about this lake, asking our
advice. It was to buy as near the crossing-place as
possible.

My companion and I, having a minute's discussion
on some point of ancient history, were amused by the
attitude which the Indian, who could not tell what we
were talking about, assumed. He constituted himself
umpire, and, judging by our air and gesture, he very
seriously remarked from time to time, "you beat," or
"he beat."

Leaving a spacious bay, a northeasterly prolongation
of Chamberlain Lake, on our left, we entered through a
short strait into a small lake a couple of miles over, called
on the map Telasinis, but the Indian had no distinct
name for it, and thence into Telos Lake, which he called
Paytaywecomgomoc, or Burnt-Ground Lake. This
curved round toward the northeast, and may have been
268
three or four miles long as we paddled. He had not been
here since 1825. He did not know what Telos meant;
thought it was not Indian. He used the word "spokelogan"
(for an inlet in the shore which led nowhere),
and when I asked its meaning said that there was "no
Indian in 'em." There was a clearing, with a house and
barn, on the southwest shore, temporarily occupied by
some men who were getting the hay, as we had been
told; also a clearing for a pasture on a hill on the west
side of the lake.

We landed on a rocky point on the northeast side, to
look at some red pines (Pinus resinosa), the first we had
noticed, and get some cones, for our few which grow in
Concord do not bear any.

The outlet from the lake into the East Branch of the
Penobscot is an artificial one, and it was not very apparent
where it was exactly, but the lake ran curving far up
northeasterly into two narrow valleys or ravines, as if it
had for a long time been groping its way toward the
Penobscot waters, or remembered when it anciently
flowed there; by observing where the horizon was
lowest, and following the longest of these, we at length
reached the dam, having come about a dozen miles from
the last camp. Somebody had left a line set for trout,
and the jack knife with which the bait had been cut on
the dam beside it, an evidence that man was near, and
on a deserted log close by a loaf of bread baked in a
Yankee baker. These proved the property of a solitary
hunter, whom we soon met, and canoe and gun and
traps were not far off. He told us that it was twenty
miles farther on our route to the foot of Grand Lake,
269
where you could catch as many trout as you wanted, and
that the first house below the foot of the lake, on the
East Branch, was Hunt's, about forty-five miles farther;
though there was one about a mile and a half up Trout
Stream, some fifteen miles ahead, but it was rather a
blind route to it. It turned out that, though the stream
was in our favor, we did not reach the next house till the
morning of the third day after this. The nearest permanently
inhabited house behind us was now a dozen miles
distant, so that the interval between the two nearest
houses on our route was about sixty miles.

This hunter, who was a quite small, sunburnt man,
having already carried his canoe over, and baked his
loaf, had nothing so interesting and pressing to do as to
observe our transit. He had been out a month or more
alone. How much more wild and adventurous his life
than that of the hunter in Concord woods, who gets
back to his house and the mill-dam every night! Yet
they in the towns who have wild oats to sow commonly
sow them on cultivated and comparatively exhausted
ground. And as for the rowdy world in the large cities,
so little enterprise has it that it never adventures in this
direction, but like vermin clubs together in alleys and
drinking-saloons, its highest accomplishment, perchance,
to run beside a fire-engine and throw brickbats.
But the former is comparatively an independent and
successful man, getting his living in a way that he likes,
without disturbing his human neighbors. How much
more respectable also is the life of the solitary pioneer or
settler in these, or any woods,&mdash;having real difficulties,
not of his own creation, drawing his subsistence directly
270
from nature,&mdash;than that of the helpless multitudes in
the towns who depend on gratifying the extremely artificial
wants of society and are thrown out of employment
by hard times!

Here for the first time we found the raspberries really
plenty,&mdash;that is, on passing the height of land between
the Allegash and the East Branch of the Penobscot; the
same was true of the blueberries.

Telos Lake, the head of the St. John on this side,
and Webster Pond, the head of the East Branch of the
Penobscot, are only about a mile apart, and they are
connected by a ravine, in which but little digging was
required to make the water of the former, which is the
highest, flow into the latter. This canal, which is something
less than a mile long and about four rods wide, was
made a few years before my first visit to Maine. Since
then the lumber of the upper Allegash and its lakes has
been run down the Penobscot, that is, up the Allegash,
which here consists principally of a chain of large and
stagnant lakes, whose thoroughfares, or river-links, have
been made nearly equally stagnant by damming, and
then down the Penobscot. The rush of the water has
produced such changes in the canal that it has now the
appearance of a very rapid mountain stream flowing
through a ravine, and you would not suspect that any
digging had been required to persuade the waters of the
St. John to flow into the Penobscot here. It was so
winding that one could see but little way down.

It is stated by Springer, in his "Forest Life," that the
cause of this canal being dug was this: according to the
treaty of 1842 with Great Britain, it was agreed that all
271
the timber run down the St. John, which rises in Maine,
"when within the Province of New Brunswick ...
shall be dealt with as if it were the produce of the said
Province," which was thought by our side to mean that
it should be free from taxation. Immediately, the Province,
wishing to get something out of the Yankees,
levied a duty on all the timber that passed down the
St. John; but to satisfy its own subjects "made a corresponding
discount on the stumpage charged those
hauling timber from the crown lands." The result was
that the Yankees made the St. John run the other way,
or down the Penobscot, so that the Province lost both its
duty and its water, while the Yankees, being greatly
enriched, had reason to thank it for the suggestion.

It is wonderful how well watered this country is. As
you paddle across a lake, bays will be pointed out to you,
by following up which, and perhaps the tributary stream
which empties in, you may, after a short portage, or
possibly, at some seasons, none at all, get into another
river, which empties far away from the one you are on.
Generally, you may go in any direction in a canoe, by
making frequent but not very long portages. You are
only realizing once more what all nature distinctly
remembers here, for no doubt the waters flowed thus in
a former geological period, and, instead of being a lake
country, it was an archipelago. It seems as if the more
youthful and impressible streams can hardly resist the
numerous invitations and temptations to leave their
native beds and run down their neighbors' channels.
Your carries are often over half-submerged ground, on
the dry channels of a former period. In carrying from
272
one river to another, I did not go over such high and
rocky ground as in going about the falls of the same
river. For in the former case I was once lost in a swamp,
as I have related, and, again, found an artificial canal
which appeared to be natural.

I remember once dreaming of pushing a canoe up the
rivers of Maine, and that, when I had got so high that
the channels were dry, I kept on through the ravines and
gorges, nearly as well as before, by pushing a little
harder, and now it seemed to me that my dream was
partially realized.

Wherever there is a channel for water, there is a road
for the canoe. The pilot of the steamer which ran from
Oldtown up the Penobscot in 1854 told me that she
drew only fourteen inches, and would run easily in two
feet of water, though they did not like to. It is said that
some Western steamers can run on a heavy dew, whence
we can imagine what a canoe may do. Montresor, who
was sent from Quebec by the English about 1760 to
explore the route to the Kennebec, over which Arnold
afterward passed, supplied the Penobscot near its source
with water by opening the beaver-dams, and he says,
"This is often done." He afterward states that the
Governor of Canada had forbidden to molest the beaver
about the outlet of the Kennebec from Moosehead Lake,
on account of the service which their dams did by raising
the water for navigation.

This canal, so called, was a considerable and extremely
rapid and rocky river. The Indian decided that
there was water enough in it without raising the dam,
which would only make it more violent, and that he
273
would run down it alone, while we carried the greater
part of the baggage. Our provision being about half
consumed, there was the less left in the canoe. We had
thrown away the pork-keg, and wrapt its contents in
birch bark, which is the unequaled wrapping-paper of
the woods.

Following a moist trail through the forest, we reached
the head of Webster Pond about the same time with the
Indian, notwithstanding the velocity with which he
moved, our route being the most direct. The Indian
name of Webster Stream, of which this pond is the
source, is, according to him, Madunkchunk , i.&nbsp;e., Height
of Land, and of the pond, Madunkchunk-gamooc, or
Height of Land Pond. The latter was two or three miles
long. We passed near a pine on its shore which had been
splintered by lightning, perhaps the day before. This
was the first proper East Branch Penobscot water that
we came to.

At the outlet of Webster Lake was another dam, at
which we stopped and picked raspberries, while the
Indian went down the stream a half-mile through the
forest, to see what he had got to contend with. There
was a deserted log camp here, apparently used the previous
winter, with its "hovel" or barn for cattle. In the
hut was a large fir twig bed, raised two feet from the
floor, occupying a large part of the single apartment, a
long narrow table against the wall, with a stout log
bench before it, and above the table a small window, the
only one there was, which admitted a feeble light. It
was a simple and strong fort erected against the cold, and
suggested what valiant trencher work had been done
274
there. I discovered one or two curious wooden traps,
which had not been used for a long time, in the woods
near by. The principal part consisted of a long and
slender pole.

We got our dinner on the shore, on the upper side of
the dam. As we were sitting by our fire, concealed by the
earth bank of the dam, a long line of sheldrake, half-grown,
came waddling over it from the water below,
passing within about a rod of us, so that we could almost
have caught them in our hands. They were very abundant
on all the streams and lakes which we visited, and
every two or three hours they would rush away in a long
string over the water before us, twenty to fifty of them
at once, rarely ever flying, but running with great rapidity
up or down the stream, even in the midst of the most
violent rapids, and apparently as fast up as down, or else
crossing diagonally, the old, as it appeared, behind, and
driving them, and flying to the front from time to time,
as if to direct them. We also saw many small black dippers,
which behaved in a similar manner, and, once or
twice, a few black ducks.

An Indian at Oldtown had told us that we should be
obliged to carry ten miles between Telos Lake on the
St. John and Second Lake on the East Branch of the
Penobscot; but the lumberers whom we met assured us
that there would not be more than a mile of carry. It
turned out that the Indian, who had lately been over
this route, was nearest right, as far as we were concerned.
However, if one of us could have assisted the Indian in
managing the canoe in the rapids, we might have run the
greater part of the way; but as he was alone in the management
275
of the canoe in such places, we were obliged to
walk the greater part. I did not feel quite ready to try
such an experiment on Webster Stream, which has so
bad a reputation. According to my observation, a batteau,
properly manned, shoots rapids as a matter of
course, which a single Indian with a canoe carries round.

My companion and I carried a good part of the baggage
on our shoulders, while the Indian took that which
would be least injured by wet in the canoe. We did not
know when we should see him again, for he had not been
this way since the canal was cut, nor for more than
thirty years. He agreed to stop when he got to smooth
water, come up and find our path if he could, and halloo
for us, and after waiting a reasonable time go on and try
again,&mdash;and we were to look out in like manner for him.

He commenced by running through the sluiceway
and over the dam, as usual, standing up in his tossing
canoe, and was soon out of sight behind a point in a wild
gorge. This Webster Stream is well known to lumbermen
as a difficult one. It is exceedingly rapid and rocky,
and also shallow, and can hardly be considered navigable,
unless that may mean that what is launched in it
is sure to be carried swiftly down it, though it may be
dashed to pieces by the way. It is somewhat like navigating
a thunder-spout. With commonly an irresistible
force urging you on, you have got to choose your own
course each moment, between the rocks and shallows,
and to get into it, moving forward always with the
utmost possible moderation, and often holding on, if you
can, that you may inspect the rapids before you.

By the Indian's direction we took an old path on the
276
south side, which appeared to keep down the stream,
though at a considerable distance from it, cutting off
bends, perhaps to Second Lake, having first taken the
course from the map with a compass, which was northeasterly,
for safety. It was a wild wood-path, with a few
tracks of oxen which had been driven over it, probably
to some old camp clearing, for pasturage, mingled with
the tracks of moose which had lately used it. We kept on
steadily for about an hour without putting down our
packs, occasionally winding around or climbing over a
fallen tree, for the most part far out of sight and hearing
of the river; till, after walking about three miles, we
were glad to find that the path came to the river again at
an old camp ground, where there was a small opening
in the forest, at which we paused. Swiftly as the shallow
and rocky river ran here, a continuous rapid with dancing
waves, I saw, as I sat on the shore, a long string of
sheldrakes, which something scared, run up the opposite
side of the stream by me, with the same ease that
they commonly did down it, just touching the surface
of the waves, and getting an impulse from them as they
flowed from under them; but they soon came back,
driven by the Indian, who had fallen a little behind us
on account of the windings. He shot round a point just
above, and came to land by us with considerable water
in his canoe. He had found it, as he said, "very strong
water," and had been obliged to land once before to
empty out what he had taken in. He complained that it
strained him to paddle so hard in order to keep his canoe
straight in its course, having no one in the bows to aid
him, and, shallow as it was, said that it would be no joke
277
to upset there, for the force of the water was such that he
had as lief I would strike him over the head with a paddle
as have that water strike him. Seeing him come out
of that gap was as if you should pour water down an
inclined and zigzag trough, then drop a nutshell into it,
and, taking a short cut to the bottom, get there in time
to see it come out, notwithstanding the rush and tumult,
right side up, and only partly full of water.

After a moment's breathing-space, while I held his
canoe, he was soon out of sight again around another
bend, and we, shouldering our packs, resumed our
course.

We did not at once fall into our path again, but made
our way with difficulty along the edge of the river, till at
length, striking inland through the forest, we recovered
it. Before going a mile we heard the Indian calling to us.
He had come up through the woods and along the path
to find us, having reached sufficiently smooth water to
warrant his taking us in. The shore was about one fourth
of a mile distant, through a dense, dark forest, and as he
led us back to it, winding rapidly about to the right
and left, I had the curiosity to look down carefully, and
found that he was following his steps backward. I could
only occasionally perceive his trail in the moss, and yet
he did not appear to look down nor hesitate an instant,
but led us out exactly to his canoe. This surprised me;
for without a compass, or the sight or noise of the river
to guide us, we could not have kept our course many
minutes, and could have retraced our steps but a short
distance, with a great deal of pains and very slowly,
using a laborious circumspection. But it was evident
278
that he could go back through the forest wherever he
had been during the day.

After this rough walking in the dark woods it was an
agreeable change to glide down the rapid river in the
canoe once more. This river, which was about the size
of our Assabet (in Concord), though still very swift, was
almost perfectly smooth here, and showed a very visible
declivity, a regularly inclined plane, for several miles,
like a mirror set a little aslant, on which we coasted
down. This very obvious regular descent, particularly
plain when I regarded the water-line against the shores,
made a singular impression on me, which the swiftness
of our motion probably enhanced, so that we seemed to
be gliding down a much steeper declivity than we were,
and that we could not save ourselves from rapids and
falls if we should suddenly come to them. My companion
did not perceive this slope, but I have a surveyor's
eyes, and I satisfied myself that it was no ocular illusion.
You could tell at a glance on approaching such a river
which way the water flowed, though you might perceive
no motion. I observed the angle at which a level line
would strike the surface, and calculated the amount of
fall in a rod, which did not need to be remarkably great
to produce this effect.

It was very exhilarating, and the perfection of traveling,
quite unlike floating on our dead Concord River,
the coasting down this inclined mirror, which was now
and then gently winding, down a mountain, indeed,
between two evergreen forests, edged with lofty dead
white pines, sometimes slanted half-way over the stream,
and destined soon to bridge it. I saw some monsters
279
there, nearly destitute of branches, and scarcely diminishing
in diameter for eighty or ninety feet.

As we thus swept along, our Indian repeated in a
deliberate and drawling tone the words "Daniel Webster,
great lawyer," apparently reminded of him by the
name of the stream, and he described his calling on him
once in Boston, at what he supposed was his boarding-house.
He had no business with him, but merely went
to pay his respects, as we should say. In answer to our
questions, he described his person well enough. It was
on the day after Webster delivered his Bunker Hill oration,
which I believe Polis heard. The first time he
called he waited till he was tired without seeing him, and
then went away. The next time, he saw him go by the
door of the room in which he was waiting several times,
in his shirt-sleeves, without noticing him. He thought
that if he had come to see Indians, they would not have
treated him so. At length, after very long delay, he came
in, walked toward him, and asked in a loud voice,
gruffly, "What do you want?" and he, thinking at first,
by the motion of his hand, that he was going to strike
him, said to himself, "You'd better take care; if you try
that I shall know what to do." He did not like him, and
declared that all he said "was not worth talk about a
musquash." We suggested that probably Mr. Webster
was very busy, and had a great many visitors just then.

Coming to falls and rapids, our easy progress was
suddenly terminated. The Indian went alongshore to
inspect the water, while we climbed over the rocks,
picking berries. The peculiar growth of blueberries on
the tops of large rocks here made the impression of high
280
land, and indeed this was the Height-of-Land Stream.
When the Indian came back, he remarked, "You got to
walk; ver strong water." So, taking out his canoe, he
launched it again below the falls, and was soon out of
sight. At such times he would step into the canoe, take
up his paddle, and, with an air of mystery, start off,
looking far down-stream, and keeping his own counsel,
as if absorbing all the intelligence of forest and stream
into himself; but I sometimes detected a little fun in his
face, which could yield to my sympathetic smile, for he
was thoroughly good-humored. We meanwhile scrambled
along the shore with our packs, without any path.
This was the last of our boating for the day.

The prevailing rock here was a kind of slate, standing
on its edges, and my companion, who was recently from
California, thought it exactly like that in which the gold
is found, and said that if he had had a pan he would
have liked to wash a little of the sand here.

The Indian now got along much faster than we, and
waited for us from time to time. I found here the only
cool spring that I drank at anywhere on this excursion,
a little water filling a hollow in the sandy bank. It was a
quite memorable event, and due to the elevation of the
country, for wherever else we had been the water in the
rivers and the streams emptying in was dead and warm,
compared with that of a mountainous region. It was
very bad walking along the shore over fallen and drifted
trees and bushes, and rocks, from time to time swinging
ourselves round over the water, or else taking to a gravel
bar or going inland. At one place, the Indian being
ahead, I was obliged to take off all my clothes in order
281
to ford a small but deep stream emptying in, while my
companion, who was inland, found a rude bridge, high
up in the woods, and I saw no more of him for some
time. I saw there very fresh moose tracks, found a new
goldenrod to me (perhaps Solidago thyrsoidea), and I
passed one white pine log, which had lodged, in the
forest near the edge of the stream, which was quite five
feet in diameter at the butt. Probably its size detained it.

Shortly after this I overtook the Indian at the edge
of some burnt land, which extended three or four miles
at least, beginning about three miles above Second Lake,
which we were expecting to reach that night, and which
is about ten miles from Telos Lake. This burnt region
was still more rocky than before, but, though comparatively
open, we could not yet see the lake. Not having
seen my companion for some time, I climbed, with the
Indian, a singular high rock on the edge of the river,
forming a narrow ridge only a foot or two wide at top,
in order to look for him; and, after calling many times,
I at length heard him answer from a considerable distance
inland, he having taken a trail which led off from
the river, perhaps directly to the lake, and was now in
search of the river again. Seeing a much higher rock, of
the same character, about one third of a mile farther
east, or down-stream, I proceeded toward it, through the
burnt land, in order to look for the lake from its summit,
supposing that the Indian would keep down the stream
in his canoe, and hallooing all the while that my companion
might join me on the way. Before we came
together I noticed where a moose, which possibly I had
scared by my shouting, had apparently just run along a
282
large rotten trunk of a pine, which made a bridge, thirty
or forty feet long, over a hollow, as convenient for him
as for me. The tracks were as large as those of an ox,
but an ox could not have crossed there. This burnt land
was an exceedingly wild and desolate region. Judging
by the weeds and sprouts, it appeared to have been burnt
about two years before. It was covered with charred
trunks, either prostrate or standing, which crocked our
clothes and hands, and we could not easily have distinguished
a bear there by his color. Great shells of
trees, sometimes unburnt without, or burnt on one side
only, but black within, stood twenty or forty feet high.
The fire had run up inside, as in a chimney, leaving the
sap-wood. Sometimes we crossed a rocky ravine fifty
feet wide, on a fallen trunk; and there were great fields
of fire-weed (Epilobium angustifolium) on all sides, the
most extensive that I ever saw, which presented great
masses of pink. Intermixed with these were blueberry
and raspberry bushes.

Having crossed a second rocky ridge like the first,
when I was beginning to ascend the third, the Indian,
whom I had left on the shore some fifty rods behind,
beckoned to me to come to him, but I made sign that I
would first ascend the highest rock before me, whence I
expected to see the lake. My companion accompanied
me to the top. This was formed just like the others.
Being struck with the perfect parallelism of these singular
rock hills, however much one might be in advance of
another, I took out my compass and found that they lay
northwest and southeast, the rock being on its edge, and
sharp edges they were. This one, to speak from memory,
283
was perhaps a third of a mile in length, but quite narrow,
rising gradually from the northwest to the height of
about eighty feet, but steep on the southeast end. The
southwest side was as steep as an ordinary roof, or as we
could safely climb; the northeast was an abrupt precipice
from which you could jump clean to the bottom,
near which the river flowed; while the level top of the
ridge, on which you walked along, was only from one
to three or four feet in width. For a rude illustration,
take the half of a pear cut in two lengthwise, lay it on its
flat side, the stem to the northwest, and then halve it
vertically in the direction of its length, keeping the
southwest half. Such was the general form.

There was a remarkable series of these great rock-waves
revealed by the burning; breakers, as it were. No
wonder that the river that found its way through them
was rapid and obstructed by falls. No doubt the absence
of soil on these rocks, or its dryness where there
was any, caused this to be a very thorough burning.
We could see the lake over the woods, two or three miles
ahead, and that the river made an abrupt turn southward
around the northwest end of the cliff on which we stood,
or a little above us, so that we had cut off a bend, and
that there was an important fall in it a short distance
below us. I could see the canoe a hundred rods behind,
but now on the opposite shore, and supposed that the
Indian had concluded to take out and carry round some
bad rapids on that side, and that that might be what he
had beckoned to me for; but after waiting a while I
could still see nothing of him, and I observed to my companion
that I wondered where he was, though I began
284
to suspect that he had gone inland to look for the lake
from some hilltop on that side, as we had done. This
proved to be the case; for after I had started to return
to the canoe, I heard a faint halloo, and descried him on
the top of a distant rocky hill on that side. But as, after
a long time had elapsed, I still saw his canoe in the same
place, and he had not returned to it, and appeared in no
hurry to do so, and, moreover, as I remembered that he
had previously beckoned to me, I thought that there
might be something more to delay him than I knew, and
began to return northwest, along the ridge, toward the
angle in the river. My companion, who had just been
separated from us, and had even contemplated the
necessity of camping alone, wishing to husband his
steps, and yet to keep with us, inquired where I was
going; to which I answered that I was going far enough
back to communicate with the Indian, and that then I
thought we had better go along the shore together, and
keep him in sight.

When we reached the shore, the Indian appeared
from out the woods on the opposite side, but on account
of the roar of the water it was difficult to communicate
with him. He kept along the shore westward to his
canoe, while we stopped at the angle where the stream
turned southward around the precipice. I again said
to my companion that we would keep along the shore
and keep the Indian in sight. We started to do so, being
close together, the Indian behind us having launched
his canoe again, but just then I saw the latter, who had
crossed to our side, forty or fifty rods behind, beckoning
to me, and I called to my companion, who had just disappeared
285
behind large rocks at the point of the precipice,
three or four rods before me, on his way down the
stream, that I was going to help the Indian a moment.
I did so,&mdash;helped get the canoe over a fall, lying with
my breast over a rock, and holding one end while he
received it below,&mdash;and within ten or fifteen minutes
at most I was back again at the point where the river
turned southward, in order to catch up with my companion,
while Polis glided down the river alone, parallel
with me. But to my surprise, when I rounded the precipice,
though the shore was bare of trees, without rocks,
for a quarter of a mile at least, my companion was not
to be seen. It was as if he had sunk into the earth. This
was the more unaccountable to me, because I knew that
his feet were, since our swamp walk, very sore, and that
he wished to keep with the party; and besides this was
very bad walking, climbing over or about the rocks. I
hastened along, hallooing and searching for him, thinking
he might be concealed behind a rock, yet doubting if
he had not taken the other side of the precipice, but the
Indian had got along still faster in his canoe, till he was
arrested by the falls, about a quarter of a mile below.
He then landed, and said that we could go no farther that
night. The sun was setting, and on account of falls and
rapids we should be obliged to leave this river and carry
a good way into another farther east. The first thing
then was to find my companion, for I was now very much
alarmed about him, and I sent the Indian along the
shore down-stream, which began to be covered with unburnt
wood again just below the falls, while I searched
backward about the precipice which we had passed.
286
The Indian showed some unwillingness to exert himself,
complaining that he was very tired, in consequence
of his day's work, that it had strained him very much
getting down so many rapids alone; but he went off
calling somewhat like an owl. I remembered that my
companion was near-sighted, and I feared that he had
either fallen from the precipice, or fainted and sunk
down amid the rocks beneath it. I shouted and searched
above and below this precipice in the twilight till I could
not see, expecting nothing less than to find his body
beneath it. For half an hour I anticipated and believed
only the worst. I thought what I should do the next day
if I did not find him, what I could do in such a wilderness,
and how his relatives would feel, if I should return
without him. I felt that if he were really lost away from
the river there, it would be a desperate undertaking to
find him; and where were they who could help you?
What would it be to raise the country, where there were
only two or three camps, twenty or thirty miles apart,
and no road, and perhaps nobody at home? Yet we
must try the harder, the less the prospect of success.

I rushed down from this precipice to the canoe in order
to fire the Indian's gun, but found that my companion
had the caps. I was still thinking of getting it off when
the Indian returned. He had not found him, but he said
that he had seen his tracks once or twice along the shore.
This encouraged me very much. He objected to firing
the gun, saying that if my companion heard it, which
was not likely, on account of the roar of the stream, it
would tempt him to come toward us, and he might break
his neck in the dark. For the same reason we refrained
287
from lighting a fire on the highest rock. I proposed that
we should both keep down the stream to the lake, or
that I should go at any rate, but the Indian said: "No
use, can't do anything in the dark; come morning, then
we find 'em. No harm,&mdash;he make 'em camp. No bad
animals here, no gristly bears, such as in California,
where he's been,&mdash;warm night,&mdash;he well off as you
and I." I considered that if he was well he could do
without us. He had just lived eight years in California,
and had plenty of experience with wild beasts and wilder
men, was peculiarly accustomed to make journeys of
great length; but if he were sick or dead, he was near
where we were. The darkness in the woods was by this
so thick that it alone decided the question. We must
camp where we were. I knew that he had his knapsack,
with blankets and matches, and, if well, would fare no
worse than we, except that he would have no supper nor
society.

This side of the river being so encumbered with rocks,
we crossed to the eastern or smoother shore, and proceeded
to camp there, within two or three rods of the
falls. We pitched no tent, but lay on the sand, putting a
few handfuls of grass and twigs under us, there being no
evergreen at hand. For fuel we had some of the charred
stumps. Our various bags of provisions had got quite
wet in the rapids, and I arranged them about the fire to
dry. The fall close by was the principal one on this
stream, and it shook the earth under us. It was a cool,
because dewy, night; the more so, probably, owing to
the nearness of the falls. The Indian complained a good
deal, and thought afterward that he got a cold there
288
which occasioned a more serious illness. We were not
much troubled by mosquitoes at any rate. I lay awake a
good deal from anxiety, but, unaccountably to myself,
was at length comparatively at ease respecting him. At
first I had apprehended the worst, but now I had little
doubt but that I should find him in the morning. From
time to time I fancied that I heard his voice calling
through the roar of the falls from the opposite side of the
river; but it is doubtful if we could have heard him
across the stream there. Sometimes I doubted whether
the Indian had really seen his tracks, since he manifested
an unwillingness to make much of a search, and then my
anxiety returned.

It was the most wild and desolate region we had
camped in, where, if anywhere, one might expect to meet
with befitting inhabitants, but I heard only the squeak
of a nighthawk flitting over. The moon in her first quarter,
in the fore part of the night, setting over the bare
rocky hills garnished with tall, charred, and hollow
stumps or shells of trees, served to reveal the desolation.


Thursday, July 30.


I aroused the Indian early this morning to go in search
of our companion, expecting to find him within a mile
or two, farther down the stream. The Indian wanted
his breakfast first, but I reminded him that my companion
had had neither breakfast nor supper. We were
obliged first to carry our canoe and baggage over into
another stream, the main East Branch, about three
fourths of a mile distant, for Webster Stream was no
farther navigable. We went twice over this carry, and the
289
dewy bushes wet us through like water up to the middle;
I hallooed in a high key from time to time, though I
had little expectation that I could be heard over the roar
of the rapids, and, moreover, we were necessarily on the
opposite side of the stream to him. In going over this
portage the last time, the Indian, who was before me
with the canoe on his head, stumbled and fell heavily
once, and lay for a moment silent, as if in pain. I hastily
stepped forward to help him, asking if he was much
hurt, but after a moment's pause, without replying, he
sprang up and went forward. He was all the way subject
to taciturn fits, but they were harmless ones.

We had launched our canoe and gone but little way
down the East Branch, when I heard an answering
shout from my companion, and soon after saw him
standing on a point where there was a clearing a quarter
of a mile below, and the smoke of his fire was rising near
by. Before I saw him I naturally shouted again and
again, but the Indian curtly remarked, "He hears you,"
as if once was enough. It was just below the mouth of
Webster Stream. When we arrived, he was smoking his
pipe, and said that he had passed a pretty comfortable
night, though it was rather cold, on account of the dew.

It appeared that when we stood together the previous
evening, and I was shouting to the Indian across the
river, he, being near-sighted, had not seen the Indian
nor his canoe, and when I went back to the Indian's
assistance, did not see which way I went, and supposed
that we were below and not above him, and so, making
haste to catch up, he ran away from us. Having reached
this clearing, a mile or more below our camp, the night
290
overtook him, and he made a fire in a little hollow, and
lay down by it in his blanket, still thinking that we were
ahead of him. He thought it likely that he had heard
the Indian call once the evening before, but mistook it
for an owl. He had seen one botanical rarity before it
was dark,&mdash;pure white Epilobium angustifolium amidst
the fields of pink ones, in the burnt lands. He had already
stuck up the remnant of a lumberer's shirt, found
on the point, on a pole by the waterside, for a signal, and
attached a note to it, to inform us that he had gone on
to the lake, and that if he did not find us there, he
would be back in a couple of hours. If he had not found
us soon, he had some thoughts of going back in search
of the solitary hunter whom we had met at Telos Lake,
ten miles behind, and, if successful, hire him to take
him to Bangor. But if this hunter had moved as fast as
we, he would have been twenty miles off by this time,
and who could guess in what direction? It would have
been like looking for a needle in a haymow, to search
for him in these woods. He had been considering how
long he could live on berries alone.

We substituted for his note a card containing our
names and destination, and the date of our visit, which
Polis neatly inclosed in a piece of birch bark to keep it
dry. This has probably been read by some hunter or
explorer ere this.

We all had good appetites for the breakfast which we
made haste to cook here, and then, having partially dried
our clothes, we glided swiftly down the winding stream
toward Second Lake.

As the shores became flatter with frequent gravel and
291
sand-bars, and the stream more winding in the lower
land near the lake, elms and ash trees made their appearance;
also the wild yellow lily (Lilium Canadense), some
of whose bulbs I collected for a soup. On some ridges
the burnt land extended as far as the lake. This was a
very beautiful lake, two or three miles long, with high
mountains on the southwest side, the (as our Indian
said) Nerlumskeechticook, i.&nbsp;e., Deadwater Mountain.
It appears to be the same called Carbuncle Mountain
on the map. According to Polis, it extends in separate
elevations all along this and the next lake, which is much
larger. The lake, too, I think, is called by the same
name, or perhaps with the addition of gamoc or mooc.
The morning was a bright one, and perfectly still and
serene, the lake as smooth as glass, we making the only
ripple as we paddled into it. The dark mountains about
it were seen through a glaucous mist, and the brilliant
white stems of canoe birches mingled with the other
woods around it. The wood thrush sang on the distant
shore, and the laugh of some loons, sporting in a concealed
western bay, as if inspired by the morning, came
distinct over the lake to us, and, what was more remarkable,
the echo which ran round the lake was much louder
than the original note; probably because, the loon being
in a regularly curving bay under the mountain, we were
exactly in the focus of many echoes, the sound being
reflected like light from a concave mirror. The beauty
of the scene may have been enhanced to our eyes by the
fact that we had just come together again after a night
of some anxiety. This reminded me of the Ambejijis
Lake on the West Branch, which I crossed in my first
292
coming to Maine. Having paddled down three quarters
of the lake, we came to a standstill, while my companion
let down for fish. A white (or whitish) gull sat on a rock
which rose above the surface in mid-lake not far off, quite
in harmony with the scene; and as we rested there in the
warm sun, we heard one loud crushing or crackling
sound from the forest, forty or fifty rods distant, as of a
stick broken by the foot of some large animal. Even this
was an interesting incident there. In the midst of our
dreams of giant lake trout, even then supposed to be
nibbling, our fishermen drew up a diminutive red perch,
and we took up our paddles again in haste.

It was not apparent where the outlet of this lake was,
and while the Indian thought it was in one direction,
I thought it was in another. He said, "I bet you four-pence
it is there," but he still held on in my direction,
which proved to be the right one. As we were approaching
the outlet, it being still early in the forenoon, he suddenly
exclaimed, "Moose! moose!" and told us to be
still. He put a cap on his gun, and, standing up in the
stern, rapidly pushed the canoe straight toward the shore
and the moose. It was a cow moose, about thirty rods
off, standing in the water by the side of the outlet, partly
behind some fallen timber and bushes, and at that distance
she did not look very large. She was flapping her
large ears, and from time to time poking off the flies with
her nose from some part of her body. She did not appear
much alarmed by our neighborhood, only occasionally
turned her head and looked straight at us, and then gave
her attention to the flies again. As we approached nearer
she got out of the water, stood higher, and regarded us
293
more suspiciously. Polis pushed the canoe steadily forward
in the shallow water, and I for a moment forgot
the moose in attending to some pretty rose-colored
Polygonums just rising above the surface, but the canoe
soon grounded in the mud eight or ten rods distant from
the moose, and the Indian seized his gun and prepared
to fire. After standing still a moment, she turned slowly,
as usual, so as to expose her side, and he improved this
moment to fire, over our heads. She thereupon moved
off eight or ten rods at a moderate pace, across a shallow
bay, to an old standing-place of hers, behind some fallen
red maples, on the opposite shore, and there she stood
still again a dozen or fourteen rods from us, while the
Indian hastily loaded and fired twice at her, without her
moving. My companion, who passed him his caps and
bullets, said that Polis was as excited as a boy of fifteen,
that his hand trembled, and he once put his ramrod back
upside down. This was remarkable for so experienced a
hunter. Perhaps he was anxious to make a good shot
before us. The white hunter had told me that the
Indians were not good shots, because they were excited,
though he said that we had got a good hunter with us.

The Indian now pushed quickly and quietly back,
and a long distance round, in order to get into the outlet,&mdash;for
he had fired over the neck of a peninsula between
it and the lake,&mdash;till we approached the place where
the moose had stood, when he exclaimed, "She is a
goner!" and was surprised that we did not see her as
soon as he did. There, to be sure, she lay perfectly dead,
with her tongue hanging out, just where she had stood
to receive the last shots, looking unexpectedly large and
294
horse-like, and we saw where the bullets had scarred the
trees.

Using a tape, I found that the moose measured just
six feet from the shoulder to the tip of the hoof, and was
eight feet long as she lay. Some portions of the body,
for a foot in diameter, were almost covered with flies,
apparently the common fly of our woods, with a dark
spot on the wing, and not the very large ones which
occasionally pursued us in midstream, though both are
called moose-flies.

Polis, preparing to skin the moose, asked me to help
him find a stone on which to sharpen his large knife. It
being all a flat alluvial ground where the moose had
fallen, covered with red maples, etc., this was no easy
matter; we searched far and wide, a long time, till at
length I found a flat kind of slate-stone, and soon after he
returned with a similar one, on which he soon made his
knife very sharp.

While he was skinning the moose, I proceeded to
ascertain what kind of fishes were to be found in the
sluggish and muddy outlet. The greatest difficulty was
to find a pole. It was almost impossible to find a slender,
straight pole ten or twelve feet long in those woods. You
might search half an hour in vain. They are commonly
spruce, arbor-vitæ, fir, etc., short, stout, and branchy,
and do not make good fish-poles, even after you have
patiently cut off all their tough and scraggy branches.
The fishes were red perch and chivin.

The Indian, having cut off a large piece of sirloin, the
upper lip, and the tongue, wrapped them in the hide,
and placed them in the bottom of the canoe, observing
295
that there was "one man," meaning the weight of one.
Our load had previously been reduced some thirty
pounds, but a hundred pounds were now added,&mdash;a serious
addition, which made our quarters still more narrow,
and considerably increased the danger on the lakes and
rapids, as well as the labor of the carries. The skin was
ours according to custom, since the Indian was in our
employ, but we did not think of claiming it. He being
a skillful dresser of moose-hides would make it worth
seven or eight dollars to him, as I was told. He said that
he sometimes earned fifty or sixty dollars in a day at
them; he had killed ten moose in one day, though the
skinning and all took two days. This was the way he
had got his property. There were the tracks of a calf
thereabouts, which he said would come "by, by," and he
could get it if we cared to wait, but I cast cold water on
the project.

We continued along the outlet toward Grand Lake,
through a swampy region, by a long, winding, and narrow
dead water, very much choked up by wood, where
we were obliged to land sometimes in order to get the
canoe over a log. It was hard to find any channel, and
we did not know but we should be lost in the swamp.
It abounded in ducks, as usual. At length we reached
Grand Lake, which the Indian called Matungamook.

At the head of this we saw, coming in from the southwest,
with a sweep apparently from a gorge in the mountains,
Trout Stream, or Uncardnerheese, which name,
the Indian said, had something to do with mountains.

We stopped to dine on an interesting high rocky
island, soon after entering Matungamook Lake, securing
296
our canoe to the cliffy shore. It is always pleasant to step
from a boat on to a large rock or cliff. Here was a good
opportunity to dry our dewy blankets on the open sunny
rock. Indians had recently camped here, and accidentally
burned over the western end of the island, and Polis
picked up a gun-case of blue broadcloth, and said that he
knew the Indian it belonged to, and would carry it to
him. His tribe is not so large but he may know all its
effects. We proceeded to make a fire and cook our dinner
amid some pines, where our predecessors had done
the same, while the Indian busied himself about his
moose-hide on the shore, for he said that he thought it a
good plan for one to do all the cooking, i.&nbsp;e., I suppose,
if that one were not himself. A peculiar evergreen overhung
our fire, which at first glance looked like a pitch
pine (P. rigida), with leaves little more than an inch
long, spruce-like, but we found it to be the Pinus Banksiana,&mdash;"Banks's,
or the Labrador Pine," also called
scrub pine, gray pine, etc., a new tree to us. These
must have been good specimens, for several were thirty
or thirty-five feet high. Richardson found it forty feet
high and upward, and states that the porcupine feeds on
its bark. Here also grew the red pine (Pinus resinosa).

I saw where the Indians had made canoes in a little
secluded hollow in the woods, on the top of the rock,
where they were out of the wind, and large piles of whittlings
remained. This must have been a favorite resort
for their ancestors, and, indeed, we found here the point
of an arrowhead, such as they have not used for two
centuries and now know not how to make. The Indian,
picking up a stone, remarked to me, "That very strange
297
lock (rock)." It was a piece of hornstone, which I told
him his tribe had probably brought here centuries before
to make arrowheads of. He also picked up a yellowish
curved bone by the side of our fireplace and asked me
to guess what it was. It was one of the upper incisors of a
beaver, on which some party had feasted within a year
or two. I found also most of the teeth, and the skull, etc.
We here dined on fried moose-meat.

One who was my companion in my two previous
excursions to these woods, tells me that when hunting
up the Caucomgomoc, about two years ago, he found
himself dining one day on moose-meat, mud turtle,
trout, and beaver, and he thought that there were few
places in the world where these dishes could easily be
brought together on one table.

After the almost incessant rapids and falls of the
Madunkchunk (Height-of-Land, or Webster Stream),
we had just passed through the dead water of Second
Lake, and were now in the much larger dead water of
Grand Lake, and I thought the Indian was entitled to
take an extra nap here. Ktaadn, near which we were to
pass the next day, is said to mean "Highest Land." So
much geography is there in their names. The Indian
navigator naturally distinguishes by a name those parts
of a stream where he has encountered quick water and
forks, and again, the lakes and smooth water where he
can rest his weary arms, since those are the most interesting
and more arable parts to him. The very sight
of the Nerlumskeechticook, or Deadwater Mountains, a
day's journey off over the forest, as we first saw them,
must awaken in him pleasing memories. And not less
298
interesting is it to the white traveler, when he is crossing
a placid lake in these out-of-the-way woods, perhaps
thinking that he is in some sense one of the earlier discoverers
of it, to be reminded that it was thus well known
and suitably named by Indian hunters perhaps a thousand
years ago.

Ascending the precipitous rock which formed this
long narrow island, I was surprised to find that its summit
was a narrow ridge, with a precipice on one side, and
that its axis of elevation extended from northwest to
southeast exactly like that of the great rocky ridge at the
commencement of the Burnt Ground, ten miles northwesterly.
The same arrangement prevailed here, and we
could plainly see that the mountain ridges on the west
of the lake trended the same way. Splendid large harebells
nodded over the edge and in the clefts of the cliff,
and the blueberries (Vaccinium Canadense) were for
the first time really abundant in the thin soil on its top.
There was no lack of them henceforward on the East
Branch. There was a fine view hence over the sparkling
lake, which looked pure and deep, and had two or three,
in all, rocky islands in it. Our blankets being dry, we set
out again, the Indian as usual having left his gazette on
a tree. This time it was we three in a canoe, my companion
smoking. We paddled southward down this
handsome lake, which appeared to extend nearly as far
east as south, keeping near the western shore, just outside
a small island, under the dark Nerlumskeechticook
Mountain. For I had observed on my map that this was
the course. It was three or four miles across it. It struck
me that the outline of this mountain on the southwest
299
of the lake, and of another beyond it, was not only like
that of the huge rock waves of Webster Stream, but in
the main like Kineo, on Moosehead Lake, having a
similar but less abrupt precipice at the southeast end;
in short, that all the prominent hills and ridges hereabouts
were larger or smaller Kineos, and that possibly
there was such a relation between Kineo and the rocks
of Webster Stream.



Mount Kineo Cliff


The Indian did not know exactly where the outlet
was, whether at the extreme southwest angle or more
easterly, and had asked to see my plan at the last stopping-place,
but I had forgotten to show it to him. As
usual, he went feeling his way by a middle course
between two probable points, from which he could
diverge either way at last without losing much distance.
In approaching the south shore, as the clouds looked
gusty and the waves ran pretty high, we so steered as to
get partly under the lee of an island, though at a great
distance from it.

I could not distinguish the outlet till we were almost
in it, and heard the water falling over the dam there.

Here was a considerable fall, and a very substantial
dam, but no sign of a cabin or camp. The hunter whom
we met at Telos Lake had told us that there were plenty
of trout here, but at this hour they did not rise to the bait,
only cousin trout, from the very midst of the rushing
waters. There are not so many fishes in these rivers as
in the Concord.

While we loitered here, Polis took occasion to cut
with his big knife some of the hair from his moose-hide,
and so lightened and prepared it for drying. I noticed
300
at several old Indian camps in the woods the pile of hair
which they had cut from their hides.

Having carried over the dam, he darted down the
rapids, leaving us to walk for a mile or more, where for
the most part there was no path, but very thick and
difficult traveling near the stream. At length he would
call to let us know where he was waiting for us with his
canoe, when, on account of the windings of the stream,
we did not know where the shore was, but he did not call
often enough, forgetting that we were not Indians. He
seemed to be very saving of his breath,&mdash;yet he would
be surprised if we went by, or did not strike the right
spot. This was not because he was unaccommodating,
but a proof of superior manners. Indians like to get
along with the least possible communication and ado.
He was really paying us a great compliment all the
while, thinking that we preferred a hint to a kick.

At length, climbing over the willows and fallen trees,
when this was easier than to go round or under them, we
overtook the canoe, and glided down the stream in
smooth but swift water for several miles. I here observed
again, as at Webster Stream, and on a still larger scale
the next day, that the river was a smooth and regularly
inclined plane down which we coasted. As we thus
glided along we started the first black ducks which we
had distinguished.

We decided to camp early to-night, that we might
have ample time before dark; so we stopped at the first
favorable shore, where there was a narrow gravelly
beach on the western side, some five miles below the outlet
of the lake. It was an interesting spot, where the
301
river began to make a great bend to the east, and the
last of the peculiar moose-faced Nerlumskeechticook
Mountains not far southwest of Grand Lake rose dark
in the northwest a short distance behind, displaying its
gray precipitous southeast side, but we could not see this
without coming out upon the shore.

Two steps from the water on either side, and you
come to the abrupt bushy and rooty if not turfy edge of
the bank, four or five feet high, where the interminable
forest begins, as if the stream had but just cut its way
through it.

It is surprising on stepping ashore anywhere into this
unbroken wilderness to see so often, at least within a few
rods of the river, the marks of the axe, made by lumberers
who have either camped here or driven logs past
in previous springs. You will see perchance where,
going on the same errand that you do, they have cut
large chips from a tall white pine stump for their fire.
While we were pitching the camp and getting supper,
the Indian cut the rest of the hair from his moose-hide,
and proceeded to extend it vertically on a temporary
frame between two small trees, half a dozen feet from the
opposite side of the fire, lashing and stretching it with
arbor-vitæ bark which was always at hand, and in this
case was stripped from one of the trees it was tied to.
Asking for a new kind of tea, he made us some, pretty
good, of the checkerberry (Gaultheria procumbens),
which covered the ground, dropping a little bunch of it
tied up with cedar bark into the kettle; but it was not
quite equal to the Chiogenes. We called this therefore
Checkerberry-Tea Camp.
302

I was struck with the abundance of the Linnæa
borealis, checkerberry, and Chiogenes hispidula, almost
everywhere in the Maine woods. The wintergreen
(Chimaphila umbellata) was still in bloom here, and
clintonia berries were abundant and ripe. This handsome
plant is one of the most common in that forest. We
here first noticed the moose-wood in fruit on the banks.
The prevailing trees were spruce (commonly black),
arbor-vitæ, canoe birch (black ash and elms beginning
to appear), yellow birch, red maple, and a little hemlock
skulking in the forest. The Indian said that the white
maple punk was the best for tinder, that yellow birch
punk was pretty good, but hard. After supper he put on
the moose tongue and lips to boil, cutting out the septum.
He showed me how to write on the under side of
birch bark, with a black spruce twig, which is hard and
tough, and can be brought to a point.

The Indian wandered off into the woods a short distance
just before night, and, coming back, said, "Me
found great treasure,&mdash;fifty, sixty dollars' worth."
"What's that?" we asked. "Steel traps, under a log,
thirty or forty, I didn't count 'em. I guess Indian work,&mdash;worth
three dollars apiece." It was a singular coincidence
that he should have chanced to walk to and look
under that particular log, in that trackless forest.

I saw chivin and chub in the stream when washing
my hands, but my companion tried in vain to catch
them. I also heard the sound of bullfrogs from a swamp
on the opposite side, thinking at first that they were
moose; a duck paddled swiftly by; and sitting in that
dusky wilderness, under that dark mountain, by the
303
bright river which was full of reflected light, still I heard
the wood thrush sing, as if no higher civilization could
be attained. By this time the night was upon us.

You commonly make your camp just at sundown, and
are collecting wood, getting your supper, or pitching
your tent while the shades of night are gathering around
and adding to the already dense gloom of the forest.
You have no time to explore or look around you before
it is dark. You may penetrate half a dozen rods farther
into that twilight wilderness, after some dry bark to
kindle your fire with, and wonder what mysteries lie hidden
still deeper in it, say at the end of a long day's walk;
or you may run down to the shore for a dipper of water,
and get a clearer view for a short distance up or down
the stream, and while you stand there, see a fish leap, or
duck alight in the river, or hear a wood thrush or robin
sing in the woods. That is as if you had been to town or
civilized parts. But there is no sauntering off to see the
country, and ten or fifteen rods seems a great way from
your companions, and you come back with the air of a
much-traveled man, as from a long journey, with adventures
to relate, though you may have heard the crackling
of the fire all the while,&mdash;and at a hundred rods you
might be lost past recovery, and have to camp out. It is
all mossy and moosey. In some of those dense fir and
spruce woods there is hardly room for the smoke to go
up. The trees are a standing night, and every fir and
spruce which you fell is a plume plucked from night's
raven wing. Then at night the general stillness is more
impressive than any sound, but occasionally you hear
the note of an owl farther or nearer in the woods, and if
304
near a lake, the semihuman cry of the loons at their
unearthly revels.

To-night the Indian lay between the fire and his
stretched moose-hide, to avoid the mosquitoes. Indeed,
he also made a small smoky fire of damp leaves at his
head and his feet, and then as usual rolled up his head
in his blanket. We with our veils and our wash were
tolerably comfortable, but it would be difficult to pursue
any sedentary occupation in the woods at this season;
you cannot see to read much by the light of a fire through
a veil in the evening, nor handle pencil and paper well
with gloves or anointed fingers.


Friday, July 31.


The Indian said, "You and I kill moose last night,
therefore use 'em best wood. Always use hard wood to
cook moose-meat." His "best wood" was rock maple.
He cast the moose's lip into the fire, to burn the hair off,
and then rolled it up with the meat to carry along.
Observing that we were sitting down to breakfast without
any pork, he said, with a very grave look, "Me want
some fat," so he was told that he might have as much as
he would fry.

We had smooth but swift water for a considerable
distance, where we glided rapidly along, scaring up
ducks and kingfishers. But, as usual, our smooth progress
ere long came to an end, and we were obliged to
carry canoe and all about half a mile down the right
bank, around some rapids or falls. It required sharp
eyes sometimes to tell which side was the carry, before
you went over the falls, but Polis never failed to land us
305
rightly. The raspberries were particularly abundant
and large here, and all hands went to eating them, the
Indian remarking on their size.

Often on bare rocky carries the trail was so indistinct
that I repeatedly lost it, but when I walked behind him
I observed that he could keep it almost like a hound, and
rarely hesitated, or, if he paused a moment on a bare
rock, his eye immediately detected some sign which
would have escaped me. Frequently we found no path
at all at these places, and were to him unaccountably
delayed. He would only say it was "ver strange."

We had heard of a Grand Fall on this stream, and
thought that each fall we came to must be it, but after
christening several in succession with this name, we gave
up the search. There were more Grand or Petty Falls
than I can remember.

I cannot tell how many times we had to walk on
account of falls or rapids. We were expecting all the
while that the river would take a final leap and get to
smooth water, but there was no improvement this forenoon.
However, the carries were an agreeable variety.
So surely as we stepped out of the canoe and stretched
our legs we found ourselves in a blueberry and raspberry
garden, each side of our rocky trail around the falls being
lined with one or both. There was not a carry on the
main East Branch where we did not find an abundance
of both these berries, for these were the rockiest places,
and partially cleared, such as these plants prefer, and
there had been none to gather the finest before us.

In our three journeys over the carries,&mdash;for we were
obliged to go over the ground three times whenever the
306
canoe was taken out,&mdash;we did full justice to the berries,
and they were just what we wanted to correct the effect of
our hard bread and pork diet. Another name for making
a portage would have been going a-berrying. We also
found a few amelanchier, or service, berries, though
most were abortive, but they held on rather more generally
than they do in Concord. The Indian called them
pemoymenuk, and said that they bore much fruit in
some places. He sometimes also ate the northern wild
red cherries, saying that they were good medicine, but
they were scarcely edible. We bathed and dined at the
foot of one of these carries. It was the Indian who commonly
reminded us that it was dinner-time, sometimes
even by turning the prow to the shore. He once made an
indirect, but lengthy apology, by saying that we might
think it strange, but that one who worked hard all day
was very particular to have his dinner in good season.
At the most considerable fall on this stream, when I was
walking over the carry, close behind the Indian, he
observed a track on the rock, which was but slightly
covered with soil, and, stooping, muttered "caribou."
When we returned, he observed a much larger track
near the same place, where some animal's foot had sunk
into a small hollow in the rock, partly filled with grass
and earth, and he exclaimed with surprise, "What
that?" "Well, what is it?" I asked. Stooping and laying
his hand in it, he answered with a mysterious air,
and in a half whisper, "Devil [that is, Indian Devil, or
cougar]&mdash;ledges about here&mdash;very bad animal&mdash;pull
'em rocks all to pieces." "How long since it was made?"
I asked. "To-day or yesterday," said he. But when I
307
asked him afterward if he was sure it was the devil's
track, he said he did not know. I had been told that the
scream of a cougar was heard about Ktaadn recently,
and we were not far from that mountain.

We spent at least half the time in walking to-day, and
the walking was as bad as usual, for the Indian, being
alone, commonly ran down far below the foot of the
carries before he waited for us. The carry-paths themselves
were more than usually indistinct, often the route
being revealed only by the countless small holes in the
fallen timber made by the tacks in the drivers' boots, or
where there was a slight trail we did not find it. It was a
tangled and perplexing thicket, through which we
stumbled and threaded our way, and when we had finished
a mile of it, our starting-point seemed far away.
We were glad that we had not got to walk to Bangor
along the banks of this river, which would be a journey
of more than a hundred miles. Think of the denseness
of the forest, the fallen trees and rocks, the windings of
the river, the streams emptying in, and the frequent
swamps to be crossed. It made you shudder. Yet the
Indian from time to time pointed out to us where he had
thus crept along day after day when he was a boy of ten,
and in a starving condition. He had been hunting far
north of this with two grown Indians. The winter came
on unexpectedly early, and the ice compelled them to
leave their canoe at Grand Lake, and walk down the
bank. They shouldered their furs and started for Oldtown.
The snow was not deep enough for snowshoes,
or to cover the inequalities of the ground. Polis was soon
too weak to carry any burden; but he managed to catch
308
one otter. This was the most they all had to eat on this
journey, and he remembered how good the yellow lily
roots were, made into a soup with the otter oil. He
shared this food equally with the other two, but being so
small he suffered much more than they. He waded
through the Mattawamkeag at its mouth, when it was
freezing cold and came up to his chin, and he, being
very weak and emaciated, expected to be swept away.
The first house which they reached was at Lincoln, and
thereabouts they met a white teamster with supplies,
who, seeing their condition, gave them as much of his
load as they could eat. For six months after getting
home, he was very low, and did not expect to live, and
was perhaps always the worse for it.

We could not find much more than half of this day's
journey on our maps (the "Map of the Public Lands of
Maine and Massachusetts," and "Colton's Railroad
and Township Map of Maine," which copies the
former). By the maps there was not more than fifteen
miles between camps at the outside, and yet we had been
busily progressing all day, and much of the time very
rapidly.

For seven or eight miles below that succession of
"Grand" falls, the aspect of the banks as well as the
character of the stream was changed. After passing a
tributary from the northeast, perhaps Bowlin Stream,
we had good swift smooth water, with a regular slope,
such as I have described. Low, grassy banks and muddy
shores began. Many elms, as well as maples, and more
ash trees, overhung the stream, and supplanted the
spruce.
309

My lily roots having been lost when the canoe was
taken out at a carry, I landed late in the afternoon, at a
low and grassy place amid maples, to gather more. It
was slow work, grubbing them up amid the sand, and
the mosquitoes were all the while feasting on me. Mosquitoes,
black flies, etc., pursued us in mid-channel, and
we were glad sometimes to get into violent rapids, for
then we escaped them.

A red-headed woodpecker flew across the river, and
the Indian remarked that it was good to eat. As we
glided swiftly down the inclined plane of the river, a
great cat owl launched itself away from a stump on the
bank, and flew heavily across the stream, and the Indian,
as usual, imitated its note. Soon the same bird flew
back in front of us, and we afterwards passed it perched
on a tree. Soon afterward a white-headed eagle sailed
down the stream before us. We drove him several miles,
while we were looking for a good place to camp, for we
expected to be overtaken by a shower,&mdash;and still we
could distinguish him by his white tail, sailing away from
time to time from some tree by the shore still farther
down the stream. Some shecorways being surprised by
us, a part of them dived, and we passed directly over
them, and could trace their course here and there by a
bubble on the surface, but we did not see them come up.
Polis detected once or twice what he called a "tow"
road, an indistinct path leading into the forest. In the
meanwhile we passed the mouth of the Seboois on our
left. This did not look so large as our stream, which was
indeed the main one. It was some time before we found
a camping-place, for the shore was either too grassy and
310
muddy, where mosquitoes abounded, or too steep a hillside.
The Indian said that there were but few mosquitoes
on a steep hillside. We examined a good place,
where somebody had camped a long time; but it seemed
pitiful to occupy an old site, where there was so much
room to choose, so we continued on. We at length found
a place to our minds, on the west bank, about a mile
below the mouth of the Seboois, where, in a very dense
spruce wood above a gravelly shore, there seemed to be
but few insects. The trees were so thick that we were
obliged to clear a space to build our fire and lie down in,
and the young spruce trees that were left were like the
wall of an apartment rising around us. We were obliged
to pull ourselves up a steep bank to get there. But the
place which you have selected for your camp, though
never so rough and grim, begins at once to have its
attractions, and becomes a very centre of civilization to
you: "Home is home, be it never so homely."

It turned out that the mosquitoes were more numerous
here than we had found them before, and the Indian
complained a good deal, though he lay, as the night
before, between three fires and his stretched hide. As I
sat on a stump by the fire, with a veil and gloves on, trying
to read, he observed, "I make you candle," and in a
minute he took a piece of birch bark about two inches
wide and rolled it hard, like an allumette fifteen inches
long, lit it, and fixed it by the other end horizontally in a
split stick three feet high, stuck it in the ground, turning
the blazing end to the wind, and telling me to snuff it
from time to time. It answered the purpose of a candle
pretty well.
311

I noticed, as I had done before, that there was a lull
among the mosquitoes about midnight, and that they
began again in the morning. Nature is thus merciful.
But apparently they need rest as well as we. Few, if any,
creatures are equally active all night. As soon as it was
light I saw, through my veil, that the inside of the tent
about our heads was quite blackened with myriads, each
one of their wings when flying, as has been calculated,
vibrating some three thousand times in a minute, and
their combined hum was almost as bad to endure as
their stings. I had an uncomfortable night on this
account though I am not sure that one succeeded in his
attempt to sting me. We did not suffer so much from
insects on this excursion as the statements of some who
have explored these woods in midsummer led us to anticipate.
Yet I have no doubt that at some seasons and in
some places they are a much more serious pest. The
Jesuit Hierome Lalemant, of Quebec, reporting the
death of Father Reni Menard, who was abandoned, lost
his way, and died in the woods, among the Ontarios near
Lake Superior, in 1661, dwells chiefly on his probable
sufferings from the attacks of mosquitoes when too weak
to defend himself, adding that there was a frightful
number of them in those parts, "and so insupportable,"
says he, "that the three Frenchmen who have made that
voyage affirm that there was no other means of defending
one's self but to run always without stopping, and it was
even necessary for two of them to be employed in driving
off these creatures while the third wanted to drink,
otherwise he could not have done it." I have no doubt
that this was said in good faith.
312


August 1.


I caught two or three large red chivin (Leuciscus
pulchellus) early this morning, within twenty feet of the
camp, which, added to the moose-tongue, that had been
left in the kettle boiling overnight, and to our other
stores, made a sumptuous breakfast. The Indian made
us some hemlock tea instead of coffee, and we were not
obliged to go as far as China for it; indeed, not quite so
far as for the fish. This was tolerable, though he said it
was not strong enough. It was interesting to see so simple
a dish as a kettle of water with a handful of green
hemlock sprigs in it, boiling over the huge fire in the
open air, the leaves fast losing their lively green color,
and know that it was for our breakfast.

We were glad to embark once more, and leave some
of the mosquitoes behind. We had passed the Wassataquoik
without perceiving it. This, according to the
Indian, is the name of the main East Branch itself, and
not properly applied to this small tributary alone, as on
the maps.

We found that we had camped about a mile above
Hunt's, which is on the east bank, and is the last house
for those who ascend Ktaadn on this side.

We had expected to ascend it from this point, but my
companion was obliged to give up this on account of sore
feet. The Indian, however, suggested that perhaps he
might get a pair of moccasins at this place, and that he
could walk very easily in them without hurting his feet,
wearing several pairs of stockings, and he said beside
that they were so porous that when you had taken in
313
water it all drained out again in a little while. We
stopped to get some sugar, but found that the family
had moved away, and the house was unoccupied, except
temporarily by some men who were getting the hay.
They told me that the road to Ktaadn left the river eight
miles above; also that perhaps we could get some sugar
at Fisk's, fourteen miles below. I do not remember that
we saw the mountain at all from the river. I noticed a
seine here stretched on the bank, which probably had
been used to catch salmon. Just below this, on the west
bank, we saw a moose-hide stretched, and with it a bearskin,
which was comparatively very small. I was the
more interested in this sight, because it was near here
that a townsman of ours, then quite a lad, and alone,
killed a large bear some years ago. The Indian said that
they belonged to Joe Aitteon, my last guide, but how he
told I do not know. He was probably hunting near, and
had left them for the day. Finding that we were going
directly to Oldtown, he regretted that he had not taken
more of the moose-meat to his family, saying that in a
short time, by drying it, he could have made it so light
as to have brought away the greater part, leaving the
bones. We once or twice inquired after the lip, which is
a famous tidbit, but he said, "That go Oldtown for my
old woman; don't get it every day."

Maples grew more and more numerous. It was lowering,
and rained a little during the forenoon, and, as we
expected a wetting, we stopped early and dined on the
east side of a small expansion of the river, just above
what are probably called Whetstone Falls, about a
dozen miles below Hunt's. There were pretty fresh
314
moose-tracks by the waterside. There were singular long
ridges hereabouts, called "horsebacks," covered with
ferns. My companion, having lost his pipe, asked the
Indian if he could not make him one. "Oh, yer," said
he, and in a minute rolled up one of birch bark, telling
him to wet the bowl from time to time. Here also he left
his gazette on a tree.

We carried round the falls just below, on the west
side. The rocks were on their edges, and very sharp.
The distance was about three fourths of a mile. When
we had carried over one load, the Indian returned by
the shore, and I by the path, and though I made no particular
haste, I was nevertheless surprised to find him at
the other end as soon as I. It was remarkable how
easily he got along over the worst ground. He said to me,
"I take canoe and you take the rest, suppose you can
keep along with me?" I thought that he meant that
while he ran down the rapids I should keep along the
shore, and be ready to assist him from time to time, as I
had done before; but as the walking would be very bad,
I answered, "I suppose you will go too fast for me, but I
will try." But I was to go by the path, he said. This I
thought would not help the matter, I should have so far
to go to get to the riverside when he wanted me. But
neither was this what he meant. He was proposing a
race over the carry, and asked me if I thought I could
keep along with him by the same path, adding that I
must be pretty smart to do it. As his load, the canoe,
would be much the heaviest and bulkiest, though the
simplest, I thought that I ought to be able to do it, and
said that I would try. So I proceeded to gather up the
315
gun, axe, paddle, kettle, frying-pan, plates, dippers,
carpets, etc., etc., and while I was thus engaged he threw
me his cowhide boots. "What, are these in the bargain?"
I asked. "Oh, yer," said he; but before I could
make a bundle of my load I saw him disappearing over
a hill with the canoe on his head; so, hastily scraping the
various articles together, I started on the run, and immediately
went by him in the bushes, but I had no sooner
left him out of sight in a rocky hollow than the greasy
plates, dippers, etc., took to themselves wings, and while
I was employed in gathering them up again, he went by
me; but hastily pressing the sooty kettle to my side, I
started once more, and soon passing him again, I saw
him no more on the carry. I do not mention this as anything
of a feat, for it was but poor running on my part,
and he was obliged to move with great caution for fear
of breaking his canoe as well as his neck. When he
made his appearance, puffing and panting like myself,
in answer to my inquiries where he had been, he said,
"Rocks (locks) cut 'em feet," and, laughing, added,
"Oh, me love to play sometimes." He said that he and
his companions, when they came to carries several miles
long, used to try who would get over first; each, perhaps,
with a canoe on his head. I bore the sign of the
kettle on my brown linen sack for the rest of the voyage.

We made a second carry on the west side, around
some falls about a mile below this. On the mainland
were Norway pines, indicating a new geological formation,
and it was such a dry and sandy soil as we had not
noticed before.

As we approached the mouth of the East Branch,
316
we passed two or three huts, the first sign of civilization
after Hunt's, though we saw no road as yet; we heard a
cow-bell, and even saw an infant held up to a small
square window to see us pass, but apparently the infant
and the mother that held it were the only inhabitants
then at home for several miles. This took the wind out
of our sails, reminding us that we were travelers surely,
while it was a native of the soil, and had the advantage
of us. Conversation flagged. I would only hear the
Indian, perhaps, ask my companion, "You load my
pipe?" He said that he smoked alder bark, for medicine.
On entering the West Branch at Nicketow it
appeared much larger than the East. Polis remarked
that the former was all gone and lost now, that it was all
smooth water hence to Oldtown, and he threw away his
pole which was cut on the Umbazookskus. Thinking of
the rapids, he said once or twice that you wouldn't
catch him to go East Branch again; but he did not by
any means mean all that he said.

Things are quite changed since I was here eleven
years ago. Where there were but one or two houses, I
now found quite a village, with sawmills and a store (the
latter was locked, but its contents were so much the more
safely stored), and there was a stage-road to Mattawamkeag,
and the rumor of a stage. Indeed, a steamer
had ascended thus far once, when the water was very
high. But we were not able to get any sugar, only a
better shingle to lean our backs against.

We camped about two miles below Nicketow, on the
south side of the West Branch, covering with fresh twigs
the withered bed of a former traveler, and feeling that
317
we were now in a settled country, especially when in the
evening we heard an ox sneeze in its wild pasture across
the river. Wherever you land along the frequented part
of the river, you have not far to go to find these sites of
temporary inns, the withered bed of flattened twigs, the
charred sticks, and perhaps the tent-poles. And not
long since, similar beds were spread along the Connecticut,
the Hudson, and the Delaware, and longer still ago,
by the Thames and Seine, and they now help to make
the soil where private and public gardens, mansions and
palaces are. We could not get fir twigs for our bed here,
and the spruce was harsh in comparison, having more
twig in proportion to its leaf, but we improved it somewhat
with hemlock. The Indian remarked as before,
"Must have hard wood to cook moose-meat," as if that
were a maxim, and proceeded to get it. My companion
cooked some in California fashion, winding a long string
of the meat round a stick and slowly turning it in his
hand before the fire. It was very good. But the Indian,
not approving of the mode, or because he was not
allowed to cook it his own way, would not taste it. After
the regular supper we attempted to make a lily soup
of the bulbs which I had brought along, for I wished
to learn all I could before I got out of the woods. Following
the Indian's directions, for he began to be sick,
I washed the bulbs carefully, minced some moose-meat
and some pork, salted and boiled all together, but we had
not patience to try the experiment fairly, for he said it
must be boiled till the roots were completely softened so
as to thicken the soup like flour; but though we left it on
all night, we found it dried to the kettle in the morning,
318
and not yet boiled to a flour. Perhaps the roots were not
ripe enough, for they commonly gather them in the fall.
As it was, it was palatable enough, but it reminded me
of the Irishman's limestone broth. The other ingredients
were enough alone. The Indian's name for these bulbs
was Sheepnoc. I stirred the soup by accident with a
striped maple or moose-wood stick, which I had peeled,
and he remarked that its bark was an emetic.

He prepared to camp as usual between his moose-hide
and the fire; but it beginning to rain suddenly, he took
refuge under the tent with us, and gave us a song before
falling asleep. It rained hard in the night, and spoiled
another box of matches for us, which the Indian had
left out, for he was very careless; but, as usual, we had
so much the better night for the rain, since it kept the
mosquitoes down.


Sunday, August 2.


Was a cloudy and unpromising morning. One of us
observed to the Indian, "You did not stretch your
moose-hide last night, did you, Mr. Polis?" Whereat
he replied, in a tone of surprise, though perhaps not of
ill humor: "What you ask me that question for? Suppose
I stretch 'em, you see 'em. May be your way talking,
may be all right, no Indian way." I had observed
that he did not wish to answer the same question more
than once, and was often silent when it was put again
for the sake of certainty, as if he were moody. Not that
he was incommunicative, for he frequently commenced
a long-winded narrative of his own accord,&mdash;repeated
at length the tradition of some old battle, or some passage
319
in the recent history of his tribe in which he had
acted a prominent part, from time to time drawing a
long breath, and resuming the thread of his tale, with the
true story-teller's leisureliness, perhaps after shooting a
rapid,&mdash;prefacing with "We-e-ll, by-by," etc., as he
paddled along. Especially after the day's work was
over, and he had put himself in posture for the night,
he would be unexpectedly sociable, exhibit even the
bonhommie of a Frenchman, and we would fall asleep
before he got through his periods.

Nicketow is called eleven miles from Mattawamkeag
by the river. Our camp was, therefore, about nine miles
from the latter place.

The Indian was quite sick this morning with the colic.
I thought that he was the worse for the moose-meat he
had eaten.

We reached the Mattawamkeag at half past eight in
the morning, in the midst of a drizzling rain, and, after
buying some sugar, set out again.

The Indian growing much worse, we stopped in the
north part of Lincoln to get some brandy for him; but
failing in this, an apothecary recommended Brandreth's
pills, which he refused to take, because he was not
acquainted with them. He said to me, "Me doctor,&mdash;first
study my case, find out what ail 'em,&mdash;then I
know what to take." We dropped down a little farther,
and stopped at mid-forenoon on an island and made him
a dipper of tea. Here, too, we dined and did some washing
and botanizing, while he lay on the bank. In the
afternoon we went on a little farther, though the Indian
was no better. "Burntibus," as he called it, was a long,
320
smooth, lake-like reach below the Five Islands. He said
that he owned a hundred acres somewhere up this way.
As a thunder-shower appeared to be coming up, we
stopped opposite a barn on the west bank, in Chester,
about a mile above Lincoln. Here at last we were
obliged to spend the rest of the day and night, on account
of our patient, whose sickness did not abate. He lay
groaning under his canoe on the bank, looking very woebegone,
yet it was only a common case of colic. You
would not have thought, if you had seen him lying about
thus, that he was the proprietor of so many acres in that
neighborhood, was worth six thousand dollars, and had
been to Washington. It seemed to me that, like the
Irish, he made a greater ado about his sickness than
a Yankee does, and was more alarmed about himself.
We talked somewhat of leaving him with his people in
Lincoln,&mdash;for that is one of their homes,&mdash;and taking
the stage the next day, but he objected on account
of the expense saying, "Suppose me well in morning,
you and I go Oldtown by noon."

As we were taking our tea at twilight, while he lay
groaning still under his canoe, having at length found
out "what ail him," he asked me to get him a dipper of
water. Taking the dipper in one hand he seized his
powder-horn with the other, and, pouring into it a charge
or two of powder, stirred it up with his finger, and drank
it off. This was all he took to-day after breakfast beside
his tea.

To save the trouble of pitching our tent, when we had
secured our stores from wandering dogs, we camped in
the solitary half-open barn near the bank, with the
321
permission of the owner, lying on new-mown hay four
feet deep. The fragrance of the hay, in which many
ferns, etc., were mingled, was agreeable, though it was
quite alive with grasshoppers which you could hear
crawling through it. This served to graduate our approach
to houses and feather beds. In the night some
large bird, probably an owl, flitted through over our
heads, and very early in the morning we were awakened
by the twittering of swallows which had their nests there.


Monday, August 3.


We started early before breakfast, the Indian being
considerably better, and soon glided by Lincoln, and
after another long and handsome lake-like reach, we
stopped to breakfast on the west shore, two or three
miles below this town.

We frequently passed Indian islands with their small
houses on them. The Governor, Aitteon, lives in one of
them, in Lincoln.

The Penobscot Indians seem to be more social, even,
than the whites. Ever and anon in the deepest wilderness
of Maine, you come to the log hut of a Yankee or
Canada settler, but a Penobscot never takes up his
residence in such a solitude. They are not even scattered
about on their islands in the Penobscot, which
are all within the settlements, but gathered together on
two or three,&mdash;though not always on the best soil,&mdash;evidently
for the sake of society. I saw one or two houses
not now used by them, because, as our Indian Polis said,
they were too solitary.

The small river emptying in at Lincoln is the Matanancook,
322
which also, we noticed, was the name of a
steamer moored there. So we paddled and floated along,
looking into the mouths of rivers. When passing the
Mohawk Rips, or, as the Indian called them, "Mohog
lips," four or five miles below Lincoln, he told us at
length the story of a fight between his tribe and the
Mohawks there, anciently,&mdash;how the latter were overcome
by stratagem, the Penobscots using concealed
knives,&mdash;but they could not for a long time kill the
Mohawk chief, who was a very large and strong man,
though he was attacked by several canoes at once, when
swimming alone in the river.

From time to time we met Indians in their canoes,
going up river. Our man did not commonly approach
them, but exchanged a few words with them at a distance
in his tongue. These were the first Indians we had
met since leaving the Umbazookskus.

At Piscataquis Falls, just above the river of that name,
we walked over the wooden railroad on the eastern
shore, about one and a half miles long, while the Indian
glided down the rapids. The steamer from Oldtown
stops here, and passengers take a new boat above.
Piscataquis, whose mouth we here passed, means
"branch." It is obstructed by falls at its mouth, but can
be navigated with batteaux or canoes above through a
settled country, even to the neighborhood of Moosehead
Lake, and we had thought at first of going that way. We
were not obliged to get out of the canoe after this on
account of falls or rapids, nor, indeed, was it quite
necessary here. We took less notice of the scenery to-day,
because we were in quite a settled country. The river
323
became broad and sluggish, and we saw a blue heron
winging its way slowly down the stream before us.

We passed the Passadumkeag River on our left and
saw the blue Olamon mountains at a distance in the
southeast. Hereabouts our Indian told us at length the
story of their contention with the priest respecting
schools. He thought a great deal of education and had
recommended it to his tribe. His argument in its favor
was, that if you had been to college and learnt to calculate,
you could "keep 'em property,&mdash;no other way."
He said that his boy was the best scholar in the school
at Oldtown, to which he went with whites. He himself
is a Protestant, and goes to church regularly at Oldtown.
According to his account, a good many of his tribe are
Protestants, and many of the Catholics also are in favor
of schools. Some years ago they had a schoolmaster,
a Protestant, whom they liked very well. The priest
came and said that they must send him away, and
finally he had such influence, telling them that they
would go to the bad place at last if they retained him,
that they sent him away. The school party, though
numerous, were about giving up. Bishop Fenwick came
from Boston and used his influence against them. But
our Indian told his side that they must not give up, must
hold on, they were the strongest. If they gave up, then
they would have no party. But they answered that it
was "no use, priest too strong, we'd better give up." At
length he persuaded them to make a stand.

The priest was going for a sign to cut down the liberty-pole.
So Polis and his party had a secret meeting about
it; he got ready fifteen or twenty stout young men,
324
"stript 'em naked, and painted 'em like old times," and
told them that when the priest and his party went to
cut down the liberty-pole, they were to rush up, take
hold of it, and prevent them, and he assured them that
there would be no war, only a noise,&mdash;"no war where
priest is." He kept his men concealed in a house near
by, and when the priest's party were about to cut down
the liberty-pole, the fall of which would have been a
death-blow to the school party, he gave a signal, and his
young men rushed out and seized the pole. There was
a great uproar, and they were about coming to blows,
but the priest interfered, saying, "No war, no war," and
so the pole stands, and the school goes on still.

We thought that it showed a good deal of tact in him,
to seize this occasion and take his stand on it; proving
how well he understood those with whom he had to deal.

The Olamon River comes in from the east in Greenbush
a few miles below the Passadumkeag. When we
asked the meaning of this name, the Indian said there
was an island opposite its mouth which was called
Olarmon; that in old times, when visitors were coming
to Oldtown, they used to stop there to dress and fix up
or paint themselves. "What is that which ladies used?"
he asked. Rouge? Red Vermilion? "Yer," he said,
"that is larmon, a kind of clay or red paint, which they
used to get here."

We decided that we, too, would stop at this island,
and fix up our inner man, at least, by dining.

It was a large island, with an abundance of hemp
nettle, but I did not notice any kind of red paint there.
The Olamon River, at its mouth at least, is a dead
325
stream. There was another large island in that neighborhood,
which the Indian called "Soogle" (i.&nbsp;e., Sugar)
Island.

About a dozen miles before reaching Oldtown he
inquired, "How you like 'em your pilot?" But we postponed
an answer till we had got quite back again.

The Sunkhaze, another short dead stream, comes in
from the east two miles above Oldtown. There is said to
be some of the best deer ground in Maine on this stream.
Asking the meaning of this name, the Indian said, "Suppose
you are going down Penobscot, just like we, and
you see a canoe come out of bank and go along before
you, but you no see 'em stream. That is Sunkhaze."

He had previously complimented me on my paddling,
saying that I paddled "just like anybody," giving me an
Indian name which meant "great paddler." When off
this stream he said to me, who sat in the bows, "Me
teach you paddle." So, turning toward the shore, he got
out, came forward, and placed my hands as he wished.
He placed one of them quite outside the boat, and the
other parallel with the first, grasping the paddle near
the end, not over the flat extremity, and told me to slide
it back and forth on the side of the canoe. This, I found,
was a great improvement which I had not thought of,
saving me the labor of lifting the paddle each time, and
I wondered that he had not suggested it before. It is
true, before our baggage was reduced we had been
obliged to sit with our legs drawn up, and our knees
above the side of the canoe, which would have prevented
our paddling thus, or perhaps he was afraid of
wearing out his canoe, by constant friction on the side.
326

I told him that I had been accustomed to sit in the
stern, and, lifting my paddle at each stroke, give it a
twist in order to steer the boat, only getting a pry on
the side each time, and I still paddled partly as if in
the stern. He then wanted to see me paddle in the stern.
So, changing paddles, for he had the longer and better
one, and turning end for end, he sitting flat on the bottom
and I on the crossbar, he began to paddle very hard,
trying to turn the canoe, looking over his shoulder and
laughing; but finding it in vain, he relaxed his efforts,
though we still sped along a mile or two very swiftly. He
said that he had no fault to find with my paddling in the
stern, but I complained that he did not paddle according
to his own directions in the bows.

Opposite the Sunkhaze is the main boom of the
Penobscot, where the logs from far up the river are collected
and assorted.

As we drew near to Oldtown I asked Polis if he was
not glad to get home again; but there was no relenting
to his wildness, and he said, "It makes no difference to
me where I am." Such is the Indian's pretense always.

We approached the Indian Island through the narrow
strait called "Cook." He said, "I 'xpect we take in
some water there, river so high,&mdash;never see it so high at
this season. Very rough water there, but short; swamp
steamboat once. Don't you paddle till I tell you, then
you paddle right along." It was a very short rapid.
When we were in the midst of it he shouted "paddle,"
and we shot through without taking in a drop.

Soon after the Indian houses came in sight, but I
could not at first tell my companion which of two or
327
three large white ones was our guide's. He said it was the
one with blinds.

We landed opposite his door at about four in the
afternoon, having come some forty miles this day.
From the Piscataquis we had come remarkably and
unaccountably quick, probably as fast as the stage or
the boat, though the last dozen miles was dead water.

Polis wanted to sell us his canoe, said it would last
seven or eight years, or with care, perhaps ten; but we
were not ready to buy it.

We stopped for an hour at his house, where my companion
shaved with his razor, which he pronounced in
very good condition. Mrs. P. wore a hat and had a silver
brooch on her breast, but she was not introduced to us.
The house was roomy and neat. A large new map of
Oldtown and the Indian Island hung on the wall, and
a clock opposite to it. Wishing to know when the cars
left Oldtown, Polis's son brought one of the last Bangor
papers, which I saw was directed to "Joseph Polis,"
from the office.

This was the last that I saw of Joe Polis. We took
the last train, and reached Bangor that night.



APPENDIX



I. TREES

The prevailing trees (I speak only of what I saw) on the
east and west branches of the Penobscot and on the upper part
of the Allegash were the fir, spruce (both black and white),
and arbor-vitæ, or "cedar." The fir has the darkest foliage,
and, together with the spruce, makes a very dense "black
growth," especially on the upper parts of the rivers. A dealer
in lumber with whom I talked called the former a weed, and
it is commonly regarded as fit neither for timber nor fuel. But
it is more sought after as an ornamental tree than any other
evergreen of these woods except the arbor-vitæ. The black
spruce is much more common than the white. Both are tall
and slender trees. The arbor-vitæ, which is of a more cheerful
hue, with its light-green fans, is also tall and slender, though
sometimes two feet in diameter. It often fills the swamps.

Mingled with the former, and also here and there forming
extensive and more open woods by themselves, indicating, it
is said, a better soil, were canoe and yellow birches (the
former was always at hand for kindling a fire,&mdash;we saw no
small white birches in that wilderness), and sugar and red
maples.

The aspen (Populus tremuloides) was very common on
burnt grounds. We saw many straggling white pines, commonly
unsound trees, which had therefore been skipped by
the choppers; these were the largest trees we saw; and we
330
occasionally passed a small wood in which this was the prevailing
tree; but I did not notice nearly so many of these trees
as I can see in a single walk in Concord. The speckled or
hoary alder (Alnus incana) abounds everywhere along the
muddy banks of rivers and lakes, and in swamps. Hemlock
could commonly be found for tea, but was nowhere abundant.
Yet F. A. Michaux states that in Maine, Vermont, and the
upper part of New Hampshire, etc., the hemlock forms three
fourths of the evergreen woods, the rest being black spruce.
It belongs to cold hillsides.

The elm and black ash were very common along the lower
and stiller parts of the streams, where the shores were flat and
grassy or there were low gravelly islands. They made a pleasing
variety in the scenery, and we felt as if nearer home while
gliding past them.

The above fourteen trees made the bulk of the woods which
we saw.

The larch (juniper), beech, and Norway pine (Pinus resinosa,
red pine) were only occasionally seen in particular
places. The Pinus Banksiana (gray or Northern scrub pine),
and a single small red oak (Quercus rubra) only, are on islands
in Grand Lake, on the East Branch.

The above are almost all peculiarly Northern trees, and
found chiefly, if not solely, on mountains southward.


II. FLOWERS AND SHRUBS

It appears that in a forest like this the great majority of
flowers, shrubs, and grasses are confined to the banks of the
rivers and lakes, and to the meadows, more open swamps,
burnt lands, and mountain-tops; comparatively very few
331
indeed penetrate the woods. There is no such dispersion even
of wild-flowers as is commonly supposed, or as exists in a
cleared and settled country. Most of our wild-flowers, so
called, may be considered as naturalized in the localities where
they grow. Rivers and lakes are the great protectors of such
plants against the aggressions of the forest, by their annual
rise and fall keeping open a narrow strip where these more delicate
plants have light and space in which to grow. They are
the protégés of the rivers. These narrow and straggling bands
and isolated groups are, in a sense, the pioneers of civilization.
Birds, quadrupeds, insects, and man also, in the main, follow
the flowers, and the latter in his turn makes more room for them
and for berry-bearing shrubs, birds, and small quadrupeds.
One settler told me that not only blackberries and raspberries
but mountain maples came in, in the clearing and burning.

Though plants are often referred to primitive woods as
their locality, it cannot be true of very many, unless the woods
are supposed to include such localities as I have mentioned.
Only those which require but little light, and can bear the
drip of the trees, penetrate the woods, and these have commonly
more beauty in their leaves than in their pale and
almost colorless blossoms.

The prevailing flowers and conspicuous small plants of
the woods, which I noticed, were: Clintonia borealis, linnæa,
checkerberry (Gaultheria procumbens), Aralia nudicaulis
(wild sarsaparilla), great round-leaved orchis, Dalibarda
repens, Chiogenes hispidula (creeping snowberry), Oxalis
Acetosella (common wood-sorrel), Aster acuminatus, Pyrola
secunda (one-sided pyrola), Medeola Virginica (Indian cucumber-root),
small Circæa (enchanter's nightshade), and
perhaps Cornus Canadensis (dwarf cornel).
332

Of these, the last of July, 1858, only the Aster acuminatus
and great round-leaved orchis were conspicuously in bloom.

The most common flowers of the river and lake shores were:
Thalictrum cornuti (meadow-rue); Hypericum ellipticum, mutilum,
and Canadense (St. John's-wort); horsemint; horehound,
Lycopus Virginicus and Europæus, var. sinuatus (bugle-weed);
Scutellaria galericulata (skullcap); Solidago lanceolata and
squarrosa, East Branch, (goldenrod); Diplopappus umbellatus
(double-bristled aster); Aster Radula; Cicuta maculata
and bulbifera (water hemlock); meadow-sweet; Lysimachia
stricta and ciliata (loosestrife); Galium trifidum (small bed-straw);
Lilium Canadense (wild yellow lily); Platanthera
peram&oelig;na and psycodes (great purple orchis and small purple
fringed orchis); Mimulus ringens (monkey-flower); dock
(water); blue flag; Hydrocotyle Americana (marsh pennywort);
Sanicula Canadensis (?) (black snake-root); Clematis Virginiana
(?) (common virgin's-bower); Nasturtium palustre (marsh
cress); Ranunculus recurvatus (hooked crow-foot); Asclepias
incarnata (swamp milkweed); Aster Tradescanti (Tradescant's
aster); Aster miser, also longifolius; Eupatorium purpureum,
apparently, lake shores, (Joe-Pye-weed); Apocynum
Cannabinum, East Branch, (Indian hemp); Polygonum cilinode
(bindweed); and others. Not to mention, among inferior
orders, wool-grass and the sensitive fern.

In the water, Nuphar advena (yellow pond-lily), some
potamogetons (pond-weed), Sagittaria variabilis (arrowhead),
Sium lineare (?) (water-parsnip).

Of these, those conspicuously in flower the last of July, 1857,
were: rue, Solidago lanceolata and squarrosa, Diplopappus
umbellatus, Aster Radula, Lilium Canadense, great and small
purple orchis, Mimulus ringens, blue flag, virgin's-bower, etc.
333

The characteristic flowers in swamps were: Rubus triflorus
(dwarf raspberry); Calla palustris (water-arum); and Sarracenia
purpurea (pitcher-plant). On burnt grounds: Epilobium
angustifolium, in full bloom, (great willow-herb); and
Erechthites hieracifolia (fire-weed). On cliffs: Campanula
rotundifolia (harebell); Cornus Canadensis (dwarf cornel);
Arctostaphylos Uva-Ursi (bear-berry); Potentilla tridentata
(mountain cinquefoil); Pteris aquilina (common brake). At
old camps, carries, and logging-paths: Cirsium arvense (Canada
thistle); Prunella vulgaris (common self-heal); clover; herd's-grass;
Achillea millefolium (common yarrow); Leucanthemum
vulgare (whiteweed); Aster macrophyllus; Halenia deflexa,
East Branch, (spurred gentian); Antennaria margaritacea
(pearly everlasting); Actæa rubra and alba, wet carries, (red and
white cohosh); Desmodium Canadense (tick-trefoil); sorrel.

The handsomest and most interesting flowers were the
great purple orchises, rising ever and anon, with their great
purple spikes perfectly erect, amid the shrubs and grasses
of the shore. It seemed strange that they should be made
to grow there in such profusion, seen of moose and moose-hunters
only, while they are so rare in Concord. I have never
seen this species flowering nearly so late with us, or with the
small one.

The prevailing underwoods were: Dirca palustris (moose-wood),
Acer spicatum (mountain maple), Virburnum lantanoides
(hobble-bush), and frequently Taxus baccata, var.
Canadensis (American yew).

The prevailing shrubs and small trees along the shore were:
osier rouge and alders (before mentioned); sallows, or small
willows, of two or three kinds, as Salis humilis, rostrata, and
discolor (?); Sambucus Canadensis (black elder); rose; Viburnum
334
Opulus and nudum (cranberry-tree and withe-rod);
Pyrus Americana (American mountain-ash); Corylus rostrata
(beaked hazelnut); Diervilla trifida (bush honeysuckle); Prunus
Virginiana (choke-cherry); Myrica gale (sweet-gale);
Nemopanthes Canadensis (mountain holly); Cephalanthus
occidentalis (button-bush); Ribes prostratum, in some places,
(fetid currant).

More particularly of shrubs and small trees in swamps:
some willows, Kalmia glauca (pale laurel), Ledum latifolium
and palustre (Labrador tea), Ribes lacustre (swamp
gooseberry), and in one place Betula pumila (low birch). At
camps and carries: raspberry, Vaccinium Canadense (Canada
blueberry), Prunus Pennsylvanica (also alongshore) (wild red
cherry), Amelanchier Canadensis (shad-bush), Sambucus pubens
(red-berried elder). Among those peculiar to the mountains
would be the Vaccinium Vitis-Idæa (cow-berry).

Of plants commonly regarded as introduced from Europe,
I observed at Ansel Smith's clearing, Chesuncook, abundant
in 1857: Ranunculus acris (buttercups); Plantago major
(common plantain); Chenopodium album (lamb's-quarters);
Capsella Bursa-pastoris, 1853, (shepherd's-purse); Spergula
arvensis, also north shore of Moosehead in 1853, and elsewhere,
1857, (corn-spurry); Taraxacum Dens-leonis&mdash;regarded
as indigenous by Gray, but evidently introduced there&mdash;(common
dandelion); Polygonum Persicaria and hydropiper,
by a logging-path in woods at Smith's, (lady's-thumb
and smart-weed); Rumex Acetosella, common at carries, (sheep
sorrel); Trifolium pratense, 1853, on carries, frequent, (red
clover); Leucanthemum vulgare, carries, (whiteweed); Phleum
pratense, carries, 1853 and 1857, (herd's-grass); Verbena hastata
(blue vervain); Cirsium arvense, abundant at camps,
335
1857, (Canada thistle); Rumex crispus (?), West Branch,
1853 (?), (curled dock); Verbascum Thapsus, between Bangor
and lake, 1853, (common mullein).

It appears that I saw about a dozen plants which had accompanied
man as far into the woods as Chesuncook, and
had naturalized themselves there, in 1853. Plants begin thus
early to spring by the side of a logging-path,&mdash;a mere vista
through the woods, which can only be used in the winter, on
account of the stumps and fallen trees,&mdash;which at length are
the roadside plants in old settlements. The pioneers of such
are planted in part by the first cattle, which cannot be summered
in the woods.

VI. OUTFIT FOR AN EXCURSION

The following will be a good outfit for one who wishes to
make an excursion of twelve days into the Maine woods in
July, with a companion and one Indian, for the same purposes
that I did.

Wear,&mdash;a check shirt, stout old shoes, thick socks, a neck-ribbon,
thick waistcoat, thick pants, old Kossuth hat, a linen
sack.

Carry,&mdash;in an india-rubber knapsack, with a large flap,
two shirts (check), one pair thick socks, one pair drawers,
one flannel shirt, two pocket-handkerchiefs, a light india-rubber
coat or a thick woolen one, two bosoms and collars
to go and come with, one napkin, pins, needles, thread, one
blanket, best gray, seven feet long.

Tent,&mdash;six by seven feet, and four feet high in middle,
will do; veil and gloves and insect-wash, or, better, mosquito-bars
to cover all at night; best pocket map, and perhaps
description of the route; compass; plant-book and red blotting-paper;
paper and stamps, botany, small pocket spy-glass
for birds, pocket microscope, tape-measure, insect-boxes.

Axe, full size if possible, jackknife, fish-lines, two only apiece,
with a few hooks and corks ready, and with pork for bait in
a packet, rigged; matches (some also in a small vial in the
waistcoat pocket); soap, two pieces; large knife and iron
spoon (for all); three or four old newspapers, much twine,
and several rags for dish-cloths; twenty feet of strong cord,
four-quart tin pail for kettle, two tin dippers, three tin plates,
a fry-pan.
351

Provisions.&mdash;Soft hard-bread, twenty-eight pounds; pork,
sixteen pounds; sugar, twelve pounds; one pound black tea
or three pounds coffee; one box or a pint of salt; one quart
Indian meal, to fry fish in; six lemons, good to correct the
pork and warm water; perhaps two or three pounds of rice,
for variety. You will probably get some berries, fish, etc.,
beside.

A gun is not worth the carriage, unless you go as hunters.
The pork should be in an open keg, sawed to fit; the sugar,
tea or coffee, meal, salt, etc., should be put in separate water-tight
india-rubber bags, tied with a leather string; and all
the provisions, and part of the rest of the baggage, put into
two large india-rubber bags, which have been proved to be
water-tight and durable.

Expense of preceding outfit is twenty-four dollars.

An Indian may be hired for about one dollar and fifty cents
per day, and perhaps fifty cents a week for his canoe (this
depends on the demand). The canoe should be a strong and
tight one. This expense will be nineteen dollars.

Such an excursion need not cost more than twenty-five
dollars apiece, starting at the foot of Moosehead, if you already
possess or can borrow a reasonable part of the outfit.
If you take an Indian and canoe at Oldtown, it will cost seven
or eight dollars more to transport them to the lake.

2. From William Willis, on the Language of the
Abnaquies, Maine Hist. Coll., Vol. IV.

Abalajako-megus (river near Ktaadn).

Aitteon (name of a pond and sachem).

Apmogenegamook (name of a lake).

Allagash (a bark camp). Sockbasin, a Penobscot, told him,
"The Indians gave this name to the lake from the fact of their
keeping a hunting-camp there."

Bamonewengamock, head of Allegash, Cross Lake. (Sockbasin.)

Chesuncook, Big Lake. (Sockbasin.)

Caucongamock (a lake).

Ebeeme, mountains that have plums on them. (Sockbasin).

Ktaadn. Sockbasin pronounces this Ka-tah-din, and said
it meant "large mountain or large thing."

Kenduskeag (the place of eels).

Kineo (flint), mountain on the border, etc.
356

Metawamkeag, a river with a smooth, gravelly bottom.
(Sockbasin.)

Metanawcook.

Millinoket, a lake with many islands in it. (Sockbasin.)

Matakeunk (river).

Molunkus (river).

Nicketow, Neccotoh, where two streams meet ("Forks of
the Penobscot").

Negas (Indian village on the Kenduskeag).

Orignal (Montresor's name for Moosehead Lake).

Ponguongamook, Allagash, name of a Mohawk Indian
killed there. (Sockbasin.)

Penobscot, Penobskeag, French Pentagoet, etc.

Pougohwaken (Heron Lake).

Pemadumcook (lake).

Passadumkeag, where water goes into the river above falls.
(Williamson.)

Ripogenus (river).

Sunkhaze (river), deadwater.

Souneunk.

Seboomook. Sockbasin says this word means "the shape
of a Moose's head, and was given to the lake," etc. Howard
says differently.

Seboois, a brook, a small river. (Sockbasin.)

Sebec (river).

Sebago (great water).

Telos (lake).

Telasius (lake).

Umbagog (lake), doubled up; so called from its form.
(Sockbasin.)

Umbazookskus (lake).
357

Wassatiquoik, a mountain river. (Sockbasin.)

Judge C. E. Potter of Manchester, New Hampshire, adds
in November, 1855:&mdash;

"Chesuncook. This is formed from Chesunk, or Schunk
(a goose), and Auke (a place), and means 'The Goose Place.'
Chesunk, or Schunk, is the sound made by the wild geese
when flying."

Ktaadn. This is doubtless a corruption of kees (high), and
auke (a place).

Penobscot, penapse (stone, rock place), and auke (place).

Suncook, goose place, Schunk-auke.

The Judge says that schoot means to rush, and hence schoodic
from this and auke (a place where water rushes), and that
schoon means the same; and that the Marblehead people and
others have derived the words "scoon" and "scoot" from
the Indians, and hence "schooner"; refers to a Mr. Chute.

FOOTNOTES
[1] Springer, in his Forest Life (1851), says that they first remove the
leaves and turf from the spot where they intend to build a camp, for
fear of fire; also, that "the spruce-tree is generally selected for camp-building,
it being light, straight, and quite free from sap;" that "the
roof is finally covered with the boughs of the fir, spruce, and hemlock,
so that when the snow falls upon the whole, the warmth of the camp
is preserved in the coldest weather;" and that they make the log seat
before the fire, called the "Deacon's Seat," of a spruce or fir split in
halves, with three or four stout limbs left on one side for legs, which are
not likely to get loose.

[2] The Canadians call it picquer de fond.

[3] Even the Jesuit missionaries, accustomed to the St. Lawrence
and other rivers of Canada, in their first expeditions to the Abenaquinois,
speak of rivers ferrées de rochers, shod with rocks. See also No.
10 Relations, for 1647, p. 185.

[4] "A steady current or pitch of water is preferable to one either
rising or diminishing; as, when rising rapidly, the water at the middle
of the river is considerably higher than at the shores,&mdash;so much so
as to be distinctly perceived by the eye of a spectator on the banks,
presenting an appearance like a turnpike road. The lumber, therefore,
is always sure to incline from the centre of the channel toward
either shore."&mdash;Springer.

[5] "The spruce tree," says Springer in '51, "is generally selected,
principally for the superior facilities which its numerous limbs afford
the climber. To gain the first limbs of this tree, which are from twenty
to forty feet from the ground, a smaller tree is undercut and lodged
against it, clambering up which the top of the spruce is reached. In
some cases, when a very elevated position is desired, the spruce tree
is lodged against the trunk of some lofty pine, up which we ascend to
a height twice that of the surrounding forest."

To indicate the direction of pines, one throws down a branch, and
a man on the ground takes the bearing.

[6] The bears had not touched things on our possessions. They sometimes
tear a batteau to pieces for the sake of the tar with which it is
besmeared.

[7] I cut this from a newspaper: "On the 11th (instant?) [May, '49],
on Rappogenes Falls, Mr. John Delantee, of Orono, Me., was drowned
while running logs. He was a citizen of Orono, and was twenty-six
years of age. His companions found his body, enclosed it in bark, and
buried it in the solemn woods."

[8] These twigs are called in Rasle's Dictionary Sediak.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that


You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.


1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and
the Foundation information page at <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org

Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
