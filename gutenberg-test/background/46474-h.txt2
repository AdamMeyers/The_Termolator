PREFACE


In the Pedagogical Seminary for December, 1893, in an article
on "The Hearing of Children," the last paragraph, page
438, occurred for the first time in print the word paidology.1
In The Forum for February, 1894, page 728, the first article
explanatory of paidology appeared. A more complete outlining
of the subject was as a doctor's dissertation at the
University of Jena, Germany, 1896. In the first edition of
the Standard Dictionary was included the word paidology,
wherein it was defined as "The scientific study of the child."
Paidology originated in my mind at a very unexpected moment
one day in April, 1893.

This book is the first of a series that it is my purpose to
write upon child life. The others will follow from time to
time upon the different phases of child being. This book
and the others it is hoped may appear are the outcome of
several years of study and of teaching the subject to young
men and women, which has proved to me that people are
eager to know about children in the past as well as in the
present. He who wishes to acquaint himself with children
and child nature must have a knowledge of child life as it
existed among the various nations of the world. The child
as found in Ancient Mexico and Ancient Peru is given place
here because the life and doings of these peoples have always
been attractive reading to me, and also it is well to consider
child life in these nations who reached such a high stage of
existence among the lower forms of human society and so
far removed from the civilizations of Asia and Europe. It is
hoped there is value in this work to the student of child
nature and that young people may find it interesting and
profitable.

It will be noted that there are topics of a general nature
given in this work, which purports to be a study of child
life. When it is considered that the affairs of a nation affect
every class and age of the persons constituting it and espe[Pg 8]cially
react upon women, the mothers, then it may be understood
how vital these matters become in a study of child life
among a people and how necessary they are for a better
comprehension of what is directly connected with children.
Too the term "child" is used here in a general sense, to include
all ages up to full manhood.

It seems to me that everything done and studied in my
whole life touches this science of the child and that every
one with whom I have come in contact has aided me. It is
wished here to express in a general way my thanks to these
friends for their help. I must, though, mention by name a
few who have more directly made this book possible. First
of all is President G. Stanley Hall of Clark University, the
great leader and pioneer in the study of children, with whom
I spent two years and from whom I first obtained the right
ideas of studying child life. Another is Professor Wilhelm
Rein of the University of Jena, who kindly permitted me to
use paidology as the subject for my doctor's thesis and extended
the time for working on it, thus giving me opportunity
for use of material at Berlin and when completed he
endorsed the thesis, "Paidologie, Entwurf zu einer Wissenschaft
des Kindes," to the Senate of his University. A third
one to whom I am greatly indebted is Professor Rudolph
Eucken of the University of Jena, whose lectures listened to
for a year gave me a broader view of life and the sympathy
he expressed for myself and work were of the utmost encouragement
and too at a time when well needed. I owe
much to Prof. Dr. W. Preyer of the University of Berlin,
now deceased, who wrote me encouragingly of my work before
my going to Germany and while there he talked over matters
with me and went over the thesis when completed and had
faith in the idea I was promulgating, new at that time, that
the study of the child is a science in and of itself and for
which I had originated the term paidology, and he advised
and encouraged me to make it my life study.

I must take this opportunity to express gratitude to my
wife who so willingly gave up the many things which are so
dear to a woman and a mother that there might be acquired
by myself the very best education the world could give and
so make possible the coming forth of paidology and all it may
contain.

THE HISTORICAL CHILD




CHAPTER I

THE CHILD IN MEXICO



The People. When the Spaniards entered Mexico, in the
sixteenth century, and conquered it, they found the
ruling people to be the Aztecs and whose capital city,
Tenochtitlan (Mexico City), was on an island in the lake
of Tezcoco. The Aztecs were not the first inhabitants of
Mexico as they had entered the country some five hundred
years before the Spanish conquest and through alliances and
conquests had become the ruling power about a century before
the appearance of the Spaniards. The people whom the
Aztecs found when they entered Mexico told them of a great
people who had lived before their time and the ruins of
whose great buildings remained and still exist to the present
day and who were designated the Toltecs. It has been
claimed for the Toltecs a very high state of civilization, much
in advance of the Aztecs, and some even holding that it
really equaled the civilization of the present time.


Mexico at the time of the conquest by the Spaniards was
a monarchy, in which the king stood supreme as he was a
priest of their great god, commander-in-chief of the military
forces, and supreme judge. The throne, however, was not
hereditary, as upon a vacancy a ruler was selected by four
officers appointed for that purpose by the nobles and principal
officials of the kingdom. The king was usually taken
from the ruling family and might have been a brother of the
late ruler or a nephew belonging to an elder branch. The
office-holders were usually appointed for life and at their
death the vacancies were filled by appointment by the king.
The people were divided into classes. The highest class was
a landed aristocracy, who paid no definite taxes but owed[Pg 16]
service to the king; a second class, who ranked with the
landed aristocracy, was a military nobility who held land
at the king's goodwill; the next class embraced the freemen,
who held land in common and paid taxes in common; below
these were a class of freemen who rented the lands of the
lord and made payment to him for the same; and the lowest
of all were the serfs, who were bound to the soil. They maintained
a military system and made war upon neighboring
tribes; at the time of the coming of the Spaniards this seemed
to have been carried on mostly for the purpose of securing
captives for the human sacrifices demanded by their religion.
They had an elaborate and efficient judicial system and the
laws seem to have been justly administered to all alike,
whether the ones before the courts were of higher rank or
of the common people.


Women and Marriage. The women were described by
the Spaniards as being pretty, with long black hair, and with
a serious and rather melancholy cast of countenance. It
would appear that they were treated with much consideration
by the men who permitted them to engage in festivities
and entertainments equally with themselves.

Marriage was an important institution with the Mexicans
and it was held in such high esteem that there was a tribunal
appointed for the sole purpose of attending to matters relating
to it. The customary age with men for marriage was
about twenty, women marrying at a younger age. When a
young man reached this age it became his duty to marry
and sometimes the high priest commanded it of him. The
selection of the bride was made by the parents and if a
young man refused to abide by his parents' decision and
made his own choice, he was looked upon as being quite ungrateful
to his parents. Should he refuse to marry, it was
his duty to remain continent through his life and devote himself
to the service of the gods. Should he afterward decide
to marry, he was despised by his friends and publicly denounced
for not keeping his vow to the gods and no respectable
woman would marry him.

When the parents had decided it was time for their son
to marry, all the relatives were called together and a feast
given at which the father announced to them that the son
was of proper age to be married. The son was then informed
that his parents were about to select a bride for him, to
which the young man gave consent. Then they called in[Pg 17]
the priests under whom the young man had received his
education and their permission was obtained and one of the
priests addressed the young man with advice for the occasion.
The next step was to ascertain the day and sign of the
young man's birth and also the birthday and sign of the
young woman, which was obtained through astrologers or
soothsayers. If the horoscopes of both were favorable and
showed that the union would have good fortune all was
well; if not, another girl had to be selected. If the augurs
were favorable to the union, two discreet and virtuous elderly
women were called in as go-betweens. These women
were given their directions and they called upon the parents
of the bride and after a second visit preliminaries were arranged.

The parents of the girl then called in the relatives and
friends and informed them of the affair and the girl was
given much advice by them. Then their decision was sent to
the parents of the young man. A favorable day for the marriage
was found by the augurs and both families made preparations
for the day of marriage and sent out invitations to
relatives and friends. On the day set for the marriage the
relatives and friends of the bride went to her home as did
also some of the bridegroom's relatives and friends and in
procession escorted her to his home, where the best room
in the house had been fitted up for the occasion and the
house festooned with green branches and garlands of flowers.
The bridegroom met the bride at the entrance to his
home and took her by the hand and led her into the room
for the ceremony. They were then seated upon a special
mat, the woman at the left of the man. The mother of the
bridegroom gave presents to the bride and the mother of the
bride gave presents to the bridegroom. Then the priest made
a long talk to the couple, defining their duties to one another
and toward the married state. The couple then arose
and the priest tied the end of the man's mantle to the dress
of the woman. A feast was then partaken of but in which
the couple did not participate as they were required to spend
four days in fasting and prayer in the room, closely guarded
by old women. Upon the fourth night two priests prepared
a couch of two mats and the young people were left to themselves.
The next day they underwent a baptismal ceremony
and they were adorned with new apparel and some more
advice was given them by the mothers-in-law or nearest[Pg 18]
relatives, another feast was given of which they partook, and
the marriage ceremony was then fully completed.

Cousins were allowed to marry but not nearer relatives.
As a rule a widow was not permitted to remarry except a
brother of her deceased husband and in case she had children
by the first marriage, then it was the duty of the brother-in-law
to marry her that the children might not be without the
care and protection of a father. Divorce was allowed but
only after a careful hearing by the tribunal on marriage, and
when a divorce was granted the couple could not under any
circumstances be reunited. Concubinage was practiced and
it might occur even with young people under marriageable
age upon the consent of the parents. In this there was no
contract or ceremony, the two simply living together. In
case a child was born to them a marriage was performed or
else the woman returned to her parents' house, taking the
child with her which was then considered as belonging to
her parents. This was not considered dishonorable on the
part of the girl nor were her chances for marriage in any
degree lessened by her having thus lived in a state of concubinage.
Polygamy was permitted but perhaps it was not
greatly indulged in and it was chiefly among the wealthiest
people. The necessity for monogamy seemed to be understood,
as a record is given of a father counselling his son
that for the proper perpetuation of the race but one man is
ordained but for one woman.


Birth. As soon as a woman was found to be pregnant
the relatives and friends were informed of it and a feast
was prepared, to which all were invited who had been present
at the wedding. Speeches of congratulations and of
admonition were made to the future parents. During the
period before the birth of the child, the mother was careful
and she observed many rules. "Thus, sleeping in the daytime
would contort the child's face; approaching too near
the fire or standing in the hot sun would parch the fœtus;
hard and continued work, lifting weights, running, mental
excitement, such as grief, anger, or alarm, were particularly
avoided; in case of an earthquake all the pots in the
house were covered up or broken to stop the shaking; eating
tzictli, or chicle, was thought to harden the palate of the
unborn child, and to make its gums thick so that it would
be unable to suck, and also to communicate to it a disease
called netentzzoponiztli; neither must the edible earth, of[Pg 19]
which, as we shall see in a future chapter, the Mexicans were
very fond, be eaten by the mother, lest the child should
prove weak and sickly; but everything else the woman fancied
was to be given her, because any interference with her
caprices might be hurtful to her offspring."2 When the time
of confinement drew near another feast was given and
speeches and suggestions were made. Among the higher
classes a midwife was procured and careful preparation was
made for the confinement. A woman dying in childbirth
was honored by a burial with great ceremony. When the
child was born, there was rejoicing with praises to the mother
and congratulations to parents and grandparents, and even
the child itself was spoken to in welcoming words by the
midwife as it was being dressed.


Casting the Nativity of the Infant. Astrology was held
in high esteem by the Mexicans and it was used to decide
the fortune of the infant. On the birth of a child the astrologer
was summoned and upon being told the time of the
event he cast the horoscope of the infant. If the augury was
favorable he told of the great fortune coming to the child
and of the honors and happiness to fall upon him. Should
the augury prove unfavorable, it was made less severe by
the horoscopist who found accompanying signs that helped
allay the evil coming from the bad omens.


Baptizing and Naming the Child. The rite of baptism
was early performed upon the child, at which time it was
given a name. The house was decorated with branches and
flowers, a feast was prepared, and relatives and friends invited.
Miniature weapons were used, if a boy, to show that
he was born a warrior, and, if a girl, small weaving utensils
as symbols of her future calling of housewife. The child, if
a boy, was usually named from the sign of the day or a bird
or animal, and, if a girl, was named from a flower. Sometimes
a child took its name from some important event which
occurred at the time of its birth. A solemn invocation to
the gods was made, after which the head and lips of the infant
were touched with water, the name was given to it,
and then it was lifted up to heaven and a prayer of blessing
said over it.


Care and Treatment of Children. Upon the arrival of a
child into a family, friends and neighbors congratulated them[Pg 20]
upon such, for it was deemed quite a blessing. Although
children were welcomed, yet the discipline of younger children
was rather severe and children were taught to reverence
and obey their parents and superiors. Both boys and girls
were carefully reared by the best parents.

The following admonitions of a father to his son show how
greatly these ancient Mexicans would have their children observe
a right living:       

"My son, who art come into this light from the womb of
thy mother, like the chicken from the egg, and like it, art
preparing to fly through the world, we know not how long
heaven will grant to us the enjoyment of that precious gem
which we possess in thee; but, however short is the period,
endeavor to live exactly, praying God continually to assist
thee. He created thee; thou art His property. He is thy
Father, and loves thee still more than I do; repose in Him
thy thoughts, and day and night direct thy sighs to Him.
Reverence and salute thy elders, and hold no one in contempt.
To the poor and the distressed be not dumb, but rather
use words of comfort. Honor all persons, particularly thy
parents, to whom thou owest obedience, respect, service.
Guard against imitating the example of those wicked sons
who, like brutes, that are deprived of reason, neither reverence
their parents, listen to their instruction, nor submit to
their correction; because, whoever follows their steps will
have an unhappy end, will die in a desperate or sudden
manner, or will be killed and devoured by wild beasts....

"When any one discourses with thee, hear him attentively,
and hold thyself in an easy attitude, neither playing with
thy feet, nor putting thy mantle to thy mouth, nor spitting
too often, nor looking about you here and there, nor rising
up frequently if thou art sitting; for such actions are indications
of levity and low breeding.

"When thou art at table do not eat voraciously, nor show
thy displeasure if anything displeases thee. If any one comes
unexpectedly to dinner with thee, share with him what thou
hast; and when any person is entertained by thee, do not fix
thy looks upon him.

"In walking, look where thou goest, that thou mayest not
push against any one. If thou seest another coming thy way,
go a little aside to give him room to pass. Never step before
thy elders, unless it be necessary, or that they order thee to
do so. When thou sittest at table with them, do not eat or[Pg 21]
drink before them, but attend to them in a becoming manner,
that thou mayest merit their favor.

"When they give thee anything, accept it with tokens of
gratitude; if the present is great, do not become vain or
fond of it. If the gift is small, do not despise it, nor be provoked,
nor occasion displeasure to them who favor thee. If
thou becomest rich, do not grow insolent nor scorn the poor;
for those very gods who deny riches to others in order to give
them to thee, offended by thy pride, will take them from thee
again to give to others.

"Support thyself by thy own labors; for then thy food
will be sweeter. I, my son, have supported thee hitherto with
my sweat, and have omitted no duty of a father; I have provided
thee with everything necessary, without taking it from
others. Do thou so likewise....

"Stay no longer than is necessary in the market-place;
for in such places there is the greatest danger of contracting
vices.

"When thou art offered an employment, imagine that the
proposal is made to try thee; then accept it not hastily, although
thou knowest thyself more fit than others to exercise
it; but excuse thyself until thou art obliged to accept it;
thus thou wilt be more esteemed.

"Be not dissolute; because thou wilt thereby incense the
gods, and they will cover thee with infamy. Restrain thyself,
my son, as thou are yet young, and wait until the girl whom
the gods destine for thy wife arrives at a suitable age; leave
that to their care, as they know how to order these things
properly. When the time for thy marriage is come, dare
not to make it without the consent of thy parents, otherwise it
will have an unhappy issue.

"Steal not nor give thyself up to gaming; otherwise, thou
wilt be a disgrace to thy parents, whom thou ought rather to
honor for the education they have given to thee. If thou
wilt be virtuous, thy example will put the wicked to shame.
No more, my son, enough hath been said in discharge of the
duties of a father. With these counsels I wish to fortify thy
mind. Refuse them not, nor act in contradiction to them;
for on them thy life and thy happiness depend."3

The girl was not degraded among the Mexicans, and she[Pg 22]
was treated with tenderness and love. How well cared for
was the girl is attested by the following advice of an Aztec
mother to her daughter:       

"My daughter, born of my substance, brought forth with
my pains, and nourished with my milk, I have endeavored
to bring thee up with the greatest possible care, and thy
father has wrought and polished thee like an emerald, that
thou mayest appear in the eyes of men a jewel of virtue.
Strive always to be good; for otherwise who will have thee
for a wife? Thou wilt be rejected by every one. Life is a
thorny, laborious path, and it is necessary to exert all our
powers to obtain the goods which the gods are willing to
yield to us; we must not therefore be lazy or negligent, but
diligent in everything. Be orderly and take pains to manage
the economy of thy house. Give water to thy husband
for his hands, and make bread for thy family. Wherever
thou goest, go with modesty and composure, without hurrying
thy steps, or laughing with those whom thou meetest,
neither fixing thy looks upon them nor casting thy eyes
thoughtlessly, first to one side and then to another, that thy
reputation may not be sullied; but give a courteous answer
to those who salute and put any question to thee.

"Employ thyself diligently in spinning and weaving, in
sewing and embroidering; for by these arts thou wilt gain
esteem, and all the necessaries of food and clothing. Do not
give thyself too much to sleep, nor seek the shade, but go in
the open air and there repose thyself, for effeminacy brings
along with it idleness and other vices.

"In whatever thou doest encourage not evil thoughts but
attend solely to the service of the gods, and the giving comfort
to thy parents. If thy father or thy mother calls thee,
do not stay to be called twice; but go instantly to know their
pleasure, that thou mayest not disoblige them by slowness.
Return no insolent answers, nor show any want of compliance;
but if thou canst not do what they command, make
a modest excuse. If another is called and does not come
quickly, come thou, hear what is ordered, and do it well.
Never offer thyself to do that which thou canst not do. Deceive
no person; for the gods see all thy actions. Live in
peace with everybody, and love everyone sincerely and honestly,
that thou mayest be loved by them in return.

"Be not greedy of the goods which thou hast. If thou seest
anything presented to another, give way to no mean suspi[Pg 23]cions;
for the gods, to whom every good belongs, distribute
everything as they please. If thou wouldst avoid the displeasure
of others, let none meet with it from thee.

"Guard against improper familiarities with men; nor yield
to the guilty wishes of thy heart; or thou wilt be the reproach
of thy family, and wilt pollute thy mind as mud
does water. Keep not company with dissolute, lying, or idle
women; otherwise they will infallibly infect thee by their
example. Attend upon thy family, and do not go on slight
occasions out of thy house, nor be seen wandering through the
streets, or in the market-place; for in such places thou wilt
meet thy ruin. Remember that vice, like a poisonous herb,
brings death to those who taste it; and when it once harbors
in the mind it is difficult to dispel it. If in passing through
the streets thou meetest with a froward youth who appears
agreeable to thee, give him no correspondence, but dissemble
and pass on. If he says anything to thee, take no heed of
him nor his words; and if he follows thee, turn not your face
about to look at him, lest that might inflame his passion
more. If thou behavest so, he will soon turn and let thee
proceed in peace.

"Enter not without some urgent motive into another's
house, that nothing may be either said or thought injurious
to thy honor, but if thou enterest into the house of thy relations,
salute them with respect and do not remain idle, but
immediately take up a spindle to spin or do any other thing
that occurs.

"When thou art married, respect thy husband, obey him,
and diligently do what he commands thee. Avoid incurring
his displeasure, nor show thyself passionate or ill-natured;
but receive him fondly to thy arms, even if he is poor and
lives at thy expense. If thy husband occasions thee any
disgust, let him not know thy displeasure when he commands
thee to do anything; but dissemble it at that time, and afterwards
tell him with great gentleness what vexed thee, that
he may be won by thy mildness and offend thee no farther.
Dishonor him not before others; for thou also wouldst be dishonored.
If any one comes to visit thy husband, accept the
visit kindly, and show all the civility thou canst. If thy husband
is foolish, be thou discreet. If he fails in the management
of wealth admonish him of his failings; but if he is
totally incapable of taking care of his estate, take that charge
upon thyself, attend carefully to his possessions and never[Pg 24]
omit to pay the workmen punctually. Take care not to lose
anything through negligence.

"Embrace, my daughter, the counsel which I give thee.
I am already advanced in life, and have had sufficient dealings
with the world. I am thy mother. I wish that thou
mayest live well. Fix my precepts in thy heart and bowels,
for then thou wilt live happy. If by not listening to me,
or by neglecting my instructions, any misfortunes befall thee,
the fault will be thine and the evil also. Enough, my child.
May the gods prosper thee."4


Dress. The men wore a long broad girdle or sash with
the ends hanging down before and behind, which sash often
was figured and the ends fringed or tasseled. They also
wore a cloak or mantle, which was thrown over the shoulders
and tied around the neck. The women wore a short tunic,
usually without sleeves, and with it a short skirt under which
they would wear another skirt of longer length, these skirts
often being embroidered and ornamented. Over tunic and
skirt they would wear a long loose robe, which might have at
its upper part a hood attached, for wearing over the head.
The material first used for clothing was of skins and later
of maguey and cotton. Mantles of fur and of feather-work
were also worn in cooler weather by both men and women.
They wore sandals made of deer and other skins and also
of nequen and cotton.

The ordinary way of wearing the hair was to cut it short
on the forehead and temples and let it grow at the back.
Unmarried girls wore their hair loose, while the virgins who
served in the temple had their hair cut short. In some parts
the heads of the children were shaved, with a tuft left behind.
Women after marriage on becoming mothers would sometimes
let their hair grow on all parts and arrange it on the head;
one way was to plait it and cross it on the forehead, another
way was to braid it and ornament it with flowers. Also,
sometimes the women would use a dye made of herbs on their
hair, which gave it a violet shade.

The women used paint on their faces, one fashion was to
paint the face yellow and with a pottery stamp impress a
pattern of red upon the cheeks. They painted the teeth with
cochineal and also they painted the hands, neck, and breast.
Among some peoples the women had their arms and breasts
tattooed, incisions being made with a sharp instrument and[Pg 25]
a blue color inserted. Ornaments were worn by the men,
women, and children, and by all classes of people. The higher
classes used gold and gems, while people of the lower
classes used shell and obsidian. There were a great variety
of ornaments made for the arms and neck and attached to
garments. Rings were worn on the fingers and rings and
plugs in the ears. There also were rings and plugs for the
nose and plugs for the lips, although it would appear that
these were not so much in use as were the other ornaments.
"There existed very stringent laws regarding the class of
ornaments which the different classes of people were allowed
to wear, and it was prohibited, on pain of death, for a subject
to use the same dress or ornaments as the king."5


Food and Drink. There was quite a variety of foodstuffs
in Mexico. Maize was the principal product but also there
was great use made of other grain, yams, and beans, and
there were fruits, as the banana and plantain. Their supply
of meat was obtained very greatly from the game animals,
among which were deer, wild hogs, rabbits, quails, pigeons,
ducks, turkeys, and geese. Turkeys, ducks, and geese were
domesticated, having been raised for their feathers as well
as for food. Fish was another important article of food and
both salt water and fresh water varieties were procured in
abundance.

"Miscellaneous articles of food, not already spoken of, were
axayacatl, flies of the Mexican lakes, dried, ground, boiled,
and eaten in the form of cakes; ahuauhtli, the eggs of the
same fly, a kind of native caviar; many kinds of insects, ants,
maguey-worms, and even lice; tecuitlatl, 'excrement of stone,'
a slime that was gathered on the surface of the lakes, and
dried till it resembled cheese; eggs of turkeys, iguanas, and
turtles, roasted, boiled, and in omelettes; various reptiles,
frogs, and frog-spawn; shrimps, sardines, and crabs; corn-silk,
wild-amaranth seeds, cherry-stones, tule-roots, and very
many other articles inexpressible; yucca flour, potoyucca,
tunas; honey from maize, from bees, and from the maguey;
and roasted portions of the maguey stalks and leaves."6

There were three meals a day, morning, noon, and night,
and among the higher class, at least, banquets and feasts were
quite numerous. The food was cooked and eaten from pots,
bowls, and dishes of pottery. Maize, when green, was boiled[Pg 26]
and eaten, as roasting-ears with us now, and when dry it
was sometimes parched or roasted. It was usually ground
into meal and prepared in the form of cakes. To prepare
the meal, the grain was thrown into boiling water, in which,
lime had been placed, and then the hull was removed. It
was then washed and ground on grinding-stones, called
metlatl, and then kneaded and rolled into cakes and baked,
there having been many kinds of cakes. The meal was also
boiled and made into porridge or gruel. Beans were boiled
when green and also when dry. Meats were stewed, boiled,
and roasted. Pepper was quite freely used, as was also salt.
Fruits were eaten raw, although some, as the plantain and
banana, were roasted and stewed.

There were two national drinks, octli and chocolatl, now
known as pulque and chocolate, the first an intoxicant made
from the maguey and the second from the cacao. There were
other fermented drinks prepared from grain, and a kind of
mushroom was used to put into drinks to make them more
intoxicating. Intoxication was excusable in older people but
the young people were severely punished for it and even in
case of intemperance death was the punishment paid to the
young while with the older persons only loss of rank and
property was the punishment.

Tobacco was used by the Mexicans, having been smoked
in pipes or in the form of cigars, and also it was made into
snuff and used. "A kind of chewing-gum was prepared from
resin or bitumen, though its use, at any rate in public, was
confined by custom to unmarried girls."7

Human flesh also was eaten. This was not used as a common
food but as a religious rite. The sacrifice was made on
an elevated place and after the victim's heart was taken out
as an offering to the gods, and if a warrior his head was taken
off to be preserved as a trophy, the body was then cast down
the steps and taken by minor priests and prepared for the
table as other animals. A thigh was sent to the king's palace
and the remainder was taken to the home of the warrior who
captured the victim or if a slave to the house of the owner,
who had the human flesh prepared with other dishes and
served up in an entertainment to his friends. "This was not
the coarse repast of famished cannibals, but a banquet teeming
with delicious beverages and delicate viands, prepared
with art, and attended by both sexes, who, as we shall see[Pg 27]
hereafter, conducted themselves with all the decorum of civilized
life."8

Although the eating of human flesh by the ancient Mexicans
was not merely to satisfy the appetite for such food but in
obedience to religion, yet there must have been quite a good
deal of partaking of it as the number of human sacrifices
each year was very great. Too, must be kept in view, the
sacrifices included men and women, quite often young people,
and likewise children, even infants. One peculiar custom
was that the giver of the feast where the body of a human
sacrifice was served did not partake of the flesh of his own
captive, having been disbarred from this because he was supposed
to stand to the victim in the relation of father to
son.


Lore. "Various portents were drawn from the animal
world; the cries of beasts of prey at night were supposed to
forebode disaster to those who heard them, and the voices of
certain birds were believed equally unlucky. The owl, so
closely associated with Mictlantecutli, was especially regarded
as the harbinger of ill-fortune and death, and if one
of these birds perched upon the house of a sick man his
demise was considered certain. It was held unlucky to encounter
a skunk or a weasel, and the entry into the house of
a rabbit or a troop of ants foreboded bad luck. If a certain
kind of spider was found in the house, the owner traced a
cross upon the ground, at the center of which he placed the
insect. If it went towards the north, the direction of the
underworld, it was regarded as a sign of death for the observer,
any other direction foretelling misfortune of minor
importance.

"Besides these superstitions there were a whole host of
popular beliefs, of which only a few can be given here. Many
of these were connected with food; it was customary to blow
upon maize before putting it in the cooking-pot, to 'give it
courage,' and it was believed that if a person neglected to
pick up maize-grains lying on the ground they called out to
heaven to punish the omission. If two brothers were drinking,
and the younger drank first, it was thought that the elder
would cease to grow; and it was also believed that the growth
of a child was stopped by stepping over it when seated or
lying down, but that the effect could be averted by stepping
back again. Young girls were not allowed to eat standing,[Pg 28]
for it was believed they would fail to get husbands, and children
were prevented from licking the grindstone for fear
they would lose their teeth. When a child lost one of its
first teeth, the father or mother placed the tooth in a mouse-hole,
a proceeding which was supposed to ensure the growth
of the second tooth; and all nail-parings were thrown into
the water in the hope that the auitzotl, a mythical water-animal
which was believed to eat them, would make the nails
grow. Sneezing was thought to be a sign that evil was being
spoken of the sneezer, and there was a peculiar belief that
the perfume of the flowers which were carried at banquets
and in ceremonial dances might only be inhaled from the
edges of the bouquet, since the center belonged to the god
Tezcatlipoca."9


Human Sacrifice. The sad and degrading side of the Aztec
civilization was that of human sacrifice. The number of
sacrifices was very great, estimated from twenty to fifty thousand
annually, and on one occasion alone, the dedication of
a great temple, no less than seventy thousand human beings
were sacrificed to the gods. The great object of war, along
with the desire for the extension of the kingdom, was to obtain
victims for the sacrifices and hence an enemy was never
slain in battle if there was a chance of taking him alive.
Mostly the victims were prisoners of war but slaves also were
used as sacrifices. Sometimes they offered up children, generally
infants, who were obtained by the priests, purchased
from poverty-stricken parents, who, perhaps, gave their children
as much from a sense of religious duty as for money.
These children were dressed in beautiful garments, and
adorned with flowers. They were then carried in procession
of chanting priests through the city to the place of sacrifice.
The cries they uttered were not heard because of the chants
of the priests, and the tears they shed were favorable omens.

These sacrifices were so conducted as to exhibit something
of prominence relating to the deity being worshipped. The
following illustrates this:       

"One of their most important festivals was that in honor
of their god Tezcatlipoca, whose rank was inferior only to
that of the Supreme Being. He was called 'the soul of the
world,' and supposed to have been its creator. He was depicted
as a handsome man, endowed with perpetual youth. A
year before the intended sacrifice, a captive, distinguished for[Pg 29]
his personal beauty, and without a blemish on his body, was
selected to represent this deity. Certain tutors took charge
of him, and instructed him how to perform his new part
with becoming grace and dignity. He was arrayed in a splendid
dress, regaled with incense and with a profusion of sweet-scented
flowers, of which the ancient Mexicans were as fond
as their descendants of the present day. When he went
abroad, he was attended by a train of royal pages, and, as
he halted in the streets to play some favorite melody, the
crowd prostrated themselves before him, and did him homage
as the representative of their good deity. In this way he led
an easy, luxurious life, till within a month of his sacrifice.
Four beautiful girls, bearing the names of the principal
goddesses, were then selected to share the honors of his bed;
and with them he continued to live in idle dalliance, feasted at
the banquets of the principal nobles, who paid him all the
honors of a divinity.

"At length the fatal day of sacrifice arrived. The term of
his short-lived glories was at an end. He was stripped of
his gaudy apparel, and bade adieu to the fair partners of
his revelries. One of the royal barges transported him across
the lake to a temple which rose on its margin, about a league
from the city. Hither the inhabitants of the capital flocked,
to witness the consummation of the ceremony. As the sad
procession wound up the sides of the pyramid, the unhappy
victim threw away his gay chaplets of flowers, and broke in
pieces the musical instruments with which he had solaced the
hours of captivity. On the summit he was received by
six priests, whose long and matted locks flowed disorderly
over their sable robes, covered with hieroglyphic scrolls of
mystic import. They led him to the sacrificial stone, a huge
block of jasper, with its upper surface somewhat convex. On
this the prisoner was stretched. Five priests secured his
head and his limbs; while the sixth, clad in a scarlet mantle,
emblematic of his bloody office, dexterously opened the breast
of the wretched victim with a sharp razor of itztli       a volcanic
substance, hard as flint,       and, inserting his hand into the
wound, tore out the palpitating heart. The minister of
death, first holding this up toward the sun, an object of worship
throughout Anahuac, cast it at the feet of the deity to
whom the temple was devoted, while the multitudes below
prostrated themselves in humble adoration. The tragic story
of this prisoner was expounded by the priests as the type[Pg 30]
of human destiny, which, brilliant in its commencement, too
often closes in sorrow and disaster."10


Slavery. Slavery existed, the slaves having been criminals,
prisoners of war, public debtors, persons who sold themselves
into slavery, and children. Slavery was never the
birthright of any child born in ancient Mexico. Children
born to a slave were free. Yet children could be sold into
slavery and were often sold by their parents, mostly on account
of poverty. There was one peculiar thing in slavery
here. With the consent of the master the parents could substitute
a younger child as it grew up for an older one sold
into slavery, which substitution could go on down to the
youngest child. Slavery must have been rather mild, as in
the presence of four witnesses the precise services were prescribed
when a child was sold, and a slave could have a
family and even hold other slaves, and, as was stated, all his
children were born free, the worst feature having been that
slaves were liable to be sacrificed.


Industries. Agriculture was in quite an advanced stage
in ancient Mexico. Unlike in other parts of North America,
the men engaged in the work, performed such labor as preparing
the fields, planting, and reaping, while the women
helped in scattering the grain, weeding, and winnowing.
They had no useful domesticated animals, so that the people
carried on all the kinds of farm work and the implements
were simple, as, the hoe, spade, and basket. They fertilized
the soil, let it recover from exhaustion by lying fallow, irrigated
by means of canals, surrounded the fields by adobe
walls and aloe hedges, and built granaries in which to store
the harvests.

They mined silver, lead, tin, and copper. Gold was obtained
in the form of nuggets on the surface of the ground
or from the sand in the beds of rivers. They also got quicksilver,
sulphur, alum, ocher, and other minerals which were
used in making colors and for other purposes. Although there
was an abundance of iron, it was not mined or used. They
made tools of copper, hardened with tin. Most of the instruments,
however, were of stone, such as axes and hammers.
From obsidian, a kind of volcanic glass, by means of pressure
they detached long flakes having a razor-like edge, which they
used for making knives, razors, lancets, swords, arrow-heads,
and spear-heads. They quarried stone from the hills and[Pg 31]
mountains and often transported large blocks for long distances
and erected great buildings.

The caste-system did not exist in Mexico but it was a custom,
usually observed, for the son to learn the trade of his
father. Trades were highly esteemed among them, being
learned even by the nobles. A particular part of the city was
given over to a particular trade, which had its own distinctive
mark, something like a guild, having its own god, festivals,
and the like. The high standing of the trades is shown by this
advice given by an aged chief to his son: "Apply thyself, my
son, to agriculture, or to feather-work, or some other honorable
calling. Thus did your ancestors before you. Else how
would they have provided for themselves and their families?
Never was it heard that nobility alone was able to maintain
its possessor."11

Among the manufactures were cloths made of cotton,
maguey fiber, rabbit hair, fiber of palm-leaves, and also the
cotton was mixed with the rabbit hair and with feathers in
making a very fine kind of cloth. The cloths were dyed in
different colors as they obtained a number of dyes from both
vegetable and mineral substances, probably even excelling the
Europeans in the art of dyeing. They tanned the skins of
animals both with and without the hair. The making of mats
and baskets was an important industry. Paper was made
from maguey fiber, sometimes this was mixed with fiber from
some other plants. Wood was used in making household furniture
and farming implements and they also made cups and
vases of lacquered wood. In the working of gold and silver
they had reached a high degree of perfection, making most
beautiful ornaments, which, in many instances, were superior
to the work done in Europe. They were quite skillful in the
use of feathers. Feathers were mixed with cotton and with
other fiber for the making of clothing, tapestry, carpets, and
bed-coverings. Feathers were used as ornaments and decorations,
sometimes having been tipped with gold and set in precious
stones, most beautiful fans were made in this way. The
work with feathers they most excelled in was what has been
called feather-mosaic, in which beautiful designs were worked
out and colors harmoniously blended by the skillfully pasting
of feathers on to cloth. For temporary use, as for decorations
on the occasions of special festivals, they made designs with
leaves and flowers similar to the feather-work. They were[Pg 32]
quite skillful in working precious stones, making most beautiful
ornaments from the stones found in the country, emeralds,
amethysts, and turquoises being the most abundant.
Pearls and bright colored shells were used with the stones
in the formation of necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and other
ornaments. "Mirrors of rock crystal, obsidian, and other
stones, brightly polished and encased in rich frames, were
said to reflect the human face as clearly as the best of European
manufacture."12

The making of pottery was one of the leading industries,
which products ran from coarse undecorated vessels to quite
fine ware of various colors and highly ornamented. "The
quality of the potting varies considerably according to locality,
but the finer examples, such as the ware from Cholula and
the Totonac district exhibit a very high standard of paste,
form and technique, though the potters of this region of
America cannot boast such consummate mastery over their
material as the early inhabitants of the Peruvian coast."13

The agricultural and industrial products were not only
used where produced but also carried to the different provinces
and even to other countries by traders, which occupation
was highly respected in Mexico. They took with them
the products of their own country and brought back the
products of other countries. These traders not only engaged
in trade but also acted as spies for the king and brought to
him much information concerning the places visited by them.
The products of the country and those brought in from outside
by the traders were displayed for sale in the great market-places
of the principal cities. "The great market in
Tlaltelolco moved the wonder of the conquerors; it is described
as being three times as large as that of Salamanca, and one estimate
places the daily attendance at twenty or twenty-five
thousand persons. One of the conquerors gives the following
picture of it. 'On one side are the people who sell gold; near
them are they who trade in jewels mounted in gold in the
forms of birds and animals. On another side beads and mirrors
are sold, on another, feathers and plumes of all colors
for working designs on garments, and to wear in war or at
festivals. Further on stone is worked to make razors and
swords, a remarkable thing which passes our understanding;
of it they manufacture swords and roundels. In other places[Pg 33]
they sell cloth and men's dresses of different designs; beyond,
dresses for women, and in another part footgear. A section
is reserved for the sale of prepared hides of deer and other
animals; elsewhere are baskets made of hair, such as all
Indian women use. Cotton, grain which forms their food,
bread of all kinds, pastry, fowls, and eggs are sold in different
sections; and hard by they sell hares, rabbits, deer,
quails, geese and ducks. Elsewhere wines of all sorts are for
sale, vegetables, pepper, roots, medicinal plants, which are
very numerous in this country, fruits of all kinds, wood for
building, lime and stone. In fact, each object has its appointed
place. Beside this great market-place there are in other
quarters other markets also where provisions may be
bought.' Special magistrates held courts in the market-places
to settle disputes on the spot, and there were market officials
similar to our inspectors of weights and measures. Falsification
of the latter was visited with severe punishment."14


Couriers. The means of communication between different
parts of the country was by couriers, who were trained for
this purpose from childhood. One courier would carry his
messages from one post-house to another, where another
courier would take them and carry them to the next post-house,
and so on. These couriers were so well trained from
childhood that they traveled with remarkable speed, so that
as much as two hundred miles a day would be covered by the
chain of carriers.


Amusements. Feasts were of common occurrence and
were given by people of all ranks of society. Each man vied
with the other in giving banquets and it often happened that
the host ruined himself financially by his hospitality, as it
was the custom to distribute costly presents among the guests,
and some went so far as to have sold themselves into slavery
to raise funds to give at least one big feast that would make
a name for them and thus be kept in the memory of their
fellow-men. One form of entertainment at these feasts was
the use of jesters, similar to the court-fools of European
medieval times, who made jokes at the expense of the guests,
imitated people of different nations in dress and manners,
mimicked old women and well-known eccentric individuals,
and the like.

"At the royal feasts given when the great vassals came to
the capital to render homage to their sovereign, the people[Pg 34]
flocked in from the provinces in great numbers to see the
sights, which consisted of theatrical representations, gladiatorial
combats, fights between wild beasts, athletic sports,
musical performances, and poetical recitations in honor of
kings, gods, and heroes. The nobles, in addition to this, partook
daily of banquets at the palace, and were presented by
the monarch with costly gifts."15

There were people who gave gymnastic performances and
who performed acrobatic feats such as of the present day and
with equal or even greater skill. There were running races,
swimming matches, wrestling matches, contests in shooting
with bow and arrow and in throwing the dart, and soldiers
fought with wild beasts in enclosed places. Gambling greatly
prevailed, property of all kinds was put up as stakes and even
a man might jeopardize his own personal liberty on a game
of chance. Dice was the most general gambling game.

Dancing was one of the leading amusements of the ancient
Mexicans. It formed an important part in their religious
ceremonies and much time was given by the priests in instructing
the youth in this art. Drums and other musical
instruments were used in the dancing and they were accompanied
by chants and other music of the dancers. In some of
the dances each sex danced apart, while in others they danced
together. Sometimes they danced in threes, two men and
a woman, or two women and a man, while again they danced
in pairs, with their arms round one another's waist or neck.
There was one dance which somewhat resembled the old
English May-pole dance, in which ribbons were wound and
unwound about a pole. In some of their great public dances
thousands participated. These occurred in an open place, the
musicians being placed in the center, about them was formed
a circle of the nobles and elderly people, next came a circle
of middle-aged persons, and then the young people formed
a great circle around them all. Each person was to keep his
own place on the circle while all circled about the musicians.
The inner circle moved with slow and sedate steps, the middle
circle moved more rapidly, and the outer circle of young
people twirled rapidly about with many fantastic figures.
With drums beating and other musical instruments going
and all the dancers chanting, with arms, feet, heads, and
bodies all moving in perfect accord, leaders directing, this
dancing must have made a great spectacle to the onlookers.[Pg 35]

There were not a great variety of musical instruments.
They had drums, rattles, gongs, trumpets, and whistles. There
were bands of musicians and choirs, each temple having had
a choir composed of singers of different ages, among whom
were boys of four to eight years of age. There were contests
in music and prizes were given to the successful competitors.
There were a large number of popular songs or ballads,
which were well known to all classes of the people. The
drama existed among them. The plays were given on a terrace
in the market-place or on a porch of a temple. The
players usually wore wooden masks or were disguised as animals.
The play generally was given in the form of a burlesque
and ended with the animal players giving exhibits of
the actions of the animals they represented.

"The national game of the Nahuas was the tlachtli, which
strongly resembled in many points our game of football, and
was quite as lively and full of scuffle. It was common among
all the nations whose cult was similar to the Toltec, and was
under special divine protection, though what original religious
significance it had is not clear. Indeed, for that matter,
nearly every game enjoyed divine patronage, and Ometochtli,
'two rabbits,' the god of games, according to Duran,
was generally invoked by athletes as well as by gamblers, in
conjunction with some special god. Instruments of play,
and natural objects were also conjured to grant good luck to
the applicant. As an instance of the popularity of the game
of tlachtli, it may be mentioned that a certain number of
towns contributed annually sixteen thousand balls in taxes,
that each town of any size had a special playground devoted
to the game, and that kings kept professionals to play before
them, occasionally challenging each other to a game besides.
The ground in which it was played, called the tlachco, was
an alley, one hundred feet long and half as wide, except at
each end where there were rectangular nooks, which doubtless
served as resting places for the players. The whole was enclosed
by smooth whitewashed walls, from nine to twelve feet
high on the sides, and somewhat lower at the ends, with battlements
and turrets, and decreasing in thickness toward the top.
At midnight, previous to the day fixed for the game, which was
always fixed favorably by the augurs, the priests with much
ceremony placed two idols       one representing the god of play,
the other the god of the tlachtli       upon the side walls, blessed
the edifice, and consecrated the game by throwing the ball[Pg 36]
four times round the ground, muttering the while a formula.
The owner of the tlachco, usually the lord of the place, also
performed certain ceremonies and presented offerings, before
opening the game. The balls, called ullamaloni, were of solid
India-rubber, three to four inches in diameter. The players
were simply attired in the maxtli, or breech-clout, and sometimes
wore a skin to protect the parts coming in contact with
the ball, and gloves; they played in parties, usually two or
three on each side. The rule was to hit the ball only with
knee, elbow, shoulder, or buttock, as agreed upon, the latter
was however the favorite way, and to touch the wall of the
opposite side with the ball, or to send it over, either of which
counted a point. He who struck the ball with his hand or
foot, or with any part of his body not previously agreed
upon, lost a point; to settle such matters without dispute a
priest acted as referee. On each side-wall, equidistant from
the ends, was a large stone, carved with images of idols,
pierced through the center with a hole large enough to just
admit the passage of the ball; the player who by chance or
skill drove the ball through one of these openings not only
won the game for his side, but was entitled to the cloaks of
all present, and the haste with which the spectators scrambled
off in order to save their garments is said to have been the
most amusing part of the entertainment. A feat so difficult
was, of course, rarely accomplished, save by chance, and the
successful player was made as much of as a prize-winner at
the Olympic games, nor did he omit to present thank-offerings
to the god of the game for the good fortune vouchsafed
him."16


Education. Annexed to the temples were buildings devoted
to the purpose of education for boys, youths, and young
women. The education of the males was in the hands of the
priests and of the females in the care of the priestesses. Thus
the priesthood were enabled to mould the young in their own
way. They brought the young so well under their sway that
they were never able in after life to free themselves from
such nor did they seem so to desire to do.

The sexes were not educated together nor was any intercourse
allowed between them, and if such occurred the transgression
was severely punished. The morals of both sexes
were very closely looked after. Offenses were severely pun[Pg 37]ished,
sometimes by death. Love did not lead the Aztec
youth in education, but terror.

The children of the common people and those of the higher
classes did not attend in the same buildings. Both classes
were taught such things in religion, music, painting, and the
like, as belonged to their stations in life. The boys of the
common people did the heavier and more menial work about
the temples, such as the attending to the getting of fuel for
the sacred fires and preparing the material for the repair
of the sacred edifices. The young nobles attended to the
higher duties, such as caring for the fires of the sanctuaries,
keeping the upper parts of the temples clean, and decorating
the shrines of the gods with flowers. The children of the
common classes were obliged to sleep in the school buildings
but they took their meals at home while the young nobility
remained in the buildings for meals as well as for sleeping.

For the most part the girls who attended the schools belonged
to the nobility. They attended to the lower part of
the temples, prepared the offerings of meats to the idols, and
wove and embroidered the fine cloths for the altars. They
were strictly guarded so that no intercourse could take place
between them and the youths. When they went out they
were accompanied by their teachers and they were not permitted
to pay any attention to any one, and if they did so they
were severely punished. They were instructed in religion,
household arts, spinning, the weaving of mantles, the making
of feather-work, and the like.

In the higher schools, the noble boys were taught much that
was given to the other boys and also in many of the arts
and sciences, such as the study of heroic songs and sacred
hymns, history, religion, philosophy, law, astronomy, astrology,
and the writing and interpreting of hieroglyphics. Those
destined to be priests were further educated in the priestly
duties, while those who were to enter upon a military life
were exercised in gymnastics, and trained to the use of weapons,
to shoot with the bow, to manage the shield, and to cast
darts at a mark.

When the young reached the age when marriage was permissible
or when business cares should be entered upon, they
were sent from the schools with the commendations of the
officers and teachers, which were of great aid to many in
securing positions in life.[Pg 38]

CHAPTER II

THE CHILD IN PERU



The People. The origin of the people found in Peru at the
time of the Spanish conquest is unknown. The people themselves
held to a tradition that the empire began with a settlement
in the Cuzco valley, the central region of Peru. By
the time of the coming of the Spaniards in the first part of
the sixteenth century, through military expeditions this Inca
power had been extended to include the country from the
river Ancasmayu, just north of the city of Quito, Ecuador,
to the river Maule, just south of the city of Santiago, Chile,
or from about the second degree of north latitude to the
thirty-seventh degree of south latitude, territory embraced
at the present time by Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, part of Chile,
and north-west Argentina. Before these Inca people there
seemed to have existed a race of well advanced people who
left imposing architectural remains that the Inca people were
unable to account for. To hold together the parts of the
empire, great roads were built leading from Cuzco, the capital,
to the extremities of the country. One of these great
roads ran over the grand plateau north to Quito and south to
Chile, and a second one ran each way, north and south, along
the lowlands on the border of the ocean, and these two were
connected by cross-roads. "The road over the plateau was
conducted over pathless sierras buried in snow; galleries were
cut for leagues through the living rock; rivers were crossed
by means of bridges that swung suspended in the air; precipices
were scaled by stairways hewn out of the native bed;
ravines of hideous depths were filled up with solid masonry;
in short, all the difficulties that beset a wild and mountainous
region, and which might appall the most courageous engineer
in modern times, were encountered and successfully overcome.
The length of the road, of which scattered fragments
only remain, is variously estimated at from fifteen hundred
to two thousands miles; and stone pillars, in the manner of
European mile-stones, were erected at stated intervals of[Pg 40]
somewhat more than a league, all along the route. Its
breadth scarcely exceeded twenty feet. It was built of
heavy flags of freestone, and, in some parts at least, covered
with a bituminous cement, which time has made harder than
the stone itself."17 Along these roads were a series of post-houses
for couriers, selected for their swiftness of foot, who
carried messages back and forth between the capital and the
different parts of the empire. The statement is made that
these couriers covered the distance from Quito to Cuzco, over
a thousand miles, in eight days. Along the routes were also
placed storehouses with provisions for troops or for those who
travelled on state affairs, who really were the only travellers.

At the time of the Spanish invasion, Peru was a huge bureaucracy,
which had evolved from a primitive communism
as the territory was extended by conquest. The empire was
divided into provinces and placed under rulers, below whom
was a hierarchy of officials, running down to an inspector of
ten heads of families. A careful census was kept of the
people and resources of each province, which censuses were
sent regularly to Cuzco. From these returns was estimated
the tribute each person was to give to the state, which was
not paid in money but in labor or products. No one but the
sick was permitted to remain idle and there was constant supervision
over all. No man was exempt except by special
regulation from agricultural work and military service.
"From the cradle to the grave the life of the individual
was marked out for him; as he was born so would he die, and
he lived his allotted span under the ceaseless supervision of
officials. His dress was fixed according to his district; he
might not leave his village except at the bidding of the state,
and then only for state purposes, he might not even seek a
wife outside his own community."18 Yet every one was cared
for, widows, orphans, aged, and sick, in fact no one was allowed
to suffer. The state stored in buildings provisions for
times of scarcity of crops, so as to prevent famine. At the
head of the empire was the sovereign and who bore the title
of Sapa Inca, Only Inca, the divine ruler; next to the sovereign
came the nobility of royal blood, the Inca nobility, and
who held the principal offices of the state; then came a lower
nobility, the Curac      as, who were of the original rulers of conquered
states; and last were the common people.[Pg 41]


Buildings. The buildings of the highlands were of stone,
while on the coast stone was used for foundations and brick
made of clay mixed with reeds or tough grass was used for
the walls. With stone mortar was sometimes used and sometimes
not. In the great buildings where large stones were
placed in the walls no mortar was used, and it is stated that
in some of the remains of such buildings the stones are fitted
so closely that not even a knife-blade can be inserted in the
joints. The exterior walls were often of great thickness and
the interior of the building was arranged around a court,
with windows and doors from the rooms opening on to the
court. Some of the buildings were of immense sizes, in particular
those built as fortifications and for religious purposes.
The doors were narrowed at the top, and with a stone across
the top, the arch with the keystone not showing in Peruvian
architecture. The roofs were thatched and in the large buildings
the ceilings sometimes were vaulted by having the upper
courses of masonry overlap and the whole topped by a single
slab, thus forming a kind of arch. On this lower part a
second story was built, which did not open on to the first
floor, but was approached from the hill against which the
building was built. Inside the building the walls were niched
for the purpose of decoration and also gold plates and jewels
were placed on the walls as ornaments.


Dress. The two principal garments of the ancient Peruvians
were the tunic and the robe. In the simplest form the
tunic consisted of an oblong piece of cloth, folded crosswise
in the middle and a piece cut out of the fold for the head to
go through, and the edges on each side sewed together except
a place left for the arms. Sometimes the tunic was made with
short sleeves. Often a belt was worn about the tunic at the
waist. In the coast country the material used for clothing
was cotton while wool was used in the highlands in the interior.
The quality of the clothing differed with the rank
of the wearer, the coarsest clothes were used by the common
people while the finest were reserved for the nobility and the
very finest for the sovereign. The cloths were colored and
designs woven in them and sometimes they were fringed and
embroidered and sometimes even they were further decorated
with feathers and small plates of silver and gold.

On the head were worn conical or flat-topped caps, some
having flaps to cover the ears and the back part of the head,
while others enclosed the entire head, coming down under the[Pg 42]
chin, leaving only the face exposed to view. Women wore
their hair long while with men the length of the hair proclaimed
the rank, as the higher the rank the shorter the hair
was worn, the sovereign alone having a closely cropped head.
The ruling class wore a fringed cord of vicuña wool wound
round the head three or four times, the color designating
the rank of the wearer, that of the sovereign being crimson,
of the heir to the throne yellow, and the higher officials wore
other colors. Hair was not allowed to grow on the face and
it was kept pulled out by means of small silver and copper
tweezers. They wore sandals made of the hide of the llama
or of vegetable fiber and they were fastened to the feet with
cords.

Another mark of rank, along with their colored fringed
cord, was the wearing of studs in the lobe of the ear, the
largest size having been permitted to the sovereign only, and
the sizes diminished according to rank. These ear-ornaments
were so heavy as to pull the lobes of the ears down, making
them quite large, the sovereign's ears being distended nearly
to his shoulders. Sometimes the nose and the lower lip were
pierced and ornaments worn in them. They wore necklaces
made of beads of colored shell and turquoise, finger-rings,
anklets, and bracelets of silver and gold, and pins for fastening
the cloaks. Tattooing was practiced, designs having been
worked into the skin with a blue pigment.


Food, Drink, Narcotics. Because of the country's lying
for the most part in the tropics and also being of a mountainous
nature, thus allowing different climatic conditions, there
was a plant life as found in both tropical and temperate zones
such as to offer a variety of food. In the uplands maize was
one of the staple foods, which was usually eaten whole, roasted
or boiled, maybe not used by them as bread except at festivals,
and the leaves were eaten as a vegetable. Quinoa was another
grain used by them, a kind of buckwheat. Another staple was
the potato, most commonly used in the form of chuno, in
which the potatoes were exposed to the frost for some time,
then pounded and dried in the sun, which made quite nourishing
food and could be stowed away and kept for some time.
Beans and tomatoes were also used by them. On the lowlands
along the coast were found bananas, cocoa-nuts, the
quava, and the manioc. Birds were abundant, as were also
fish, both from the lakes and the ocean. The llama and the
deer and the wild sheep of the mountains were used as food,[Pg 43]
as was the flesh of some other animals. This flesh was often
cut into strips and dried, which was called charqui, probably
from which came the term "jerked" beef.

Syrup and a kind of vinegar were made from the juice
of the maguey and also syrup was made from the juice
extracted from the stalk of the maize. They made from the
grain of the maize chica, which was the national drink of
Peru, and chica also was made from the grain of the quinoa.
But more desired than food or drink was the narcotic effect
of the coca, whose leaves were gathered and dried, mixed
with lime or bone-ash, and thus made into a preparation for
chewing. Tobacco was used by the Peruvians but they "differed
from every other Indian nation to whom it was known,
by using it only for medicinal purposes, in the form of
snuff."19


Marriage. By law in ancient Peru, every person, both male
and female, was to marry at a marriageable age, which should
be not less than twenty-four in males and eighteen or twenty
in females, it being recognized that not until that age were
people prepared to care for a family. The nobility were allowed
more than one wife but the common people were limited
to one.

According to law, each person was to marry within his
own kindred. This was not a very great restriction since all
of his community, including the town and often the whole
province, were counted his kin.

The queen of the ruler was selected from among his sisters.
No other person in the realm was allowed to marry
his own sister. This was commanded of the ruler so that
only the purest blood       the blood of the heaven-born children
of the sun       would thus flow in their offspring, thereby preventing
anything earthly from being a part of their great
rulers.

No marriage was considered legal unless the consent of the
parents had been given; nor was any contract performed
without the contracting parties so desiring it.

The ceremony was very simple and yet quite peculiar. On
a certain day of each year, designated by law, all persons of
marriageable age came together in the open squares of their
native places. The ruler of the district would take the hands
of the different couples in his and place them in each other's
and pronounce them man and wife. Among the kindred of[Pg 44]
the Inca this ceremony was performed by the Inca in person.

After all the marriage vows were performed, there was a
general good time had by the newly married pair and their
friends, which was carried on for several days. It can be
seen that these festivities must have been very general over
the whole empire, as all weddings occurred on the same day,
and as in every circle there must have been one wedding,
so there must have been among the participants in the after-feasts
nearly all, if not all, the people of the country.

The newly married pair were not left to find a home for
themselves. Each district furnished a house for each married
couple within its boundaries and gave a certain portion of
land to them, and as children came additional allotments
were made for the support of each child. For a son twice
as much land was assigned to the parents as for a daughter.
This allotment of land occurred each year and amounts were
given in accordance with the size of the family.


Care and Treatment of Children. Infants were placed in
cradles, somewhat like Indian cradles, and fastened in them
and kept in this manner, not even having been taken out and
into the mother's arms when fed. When they were weaned an
important ceremony occurred. In the first place the hair was
cut. The first lock of hair was cut from the head by an elder
relative with a stone knife and the rest of the hair was cut
by the relatives in the order of closeness of kin. The child
was then given a name, presents were given to it, and a feast
closed the proceedings. When the heir to the throne underwent
this ceremony, the High-priest of the Sun cut the first
lock of hair, and the child received many fine presents, among
them being presents from the rulers of the various provinces
of the empire. A very careful record of births and deaths
was kept.


The Virgins of the Sun. The Peruvians worshipped the
sun and they trained for this worship young women who
were called Virgins of the Sun. They were taken from their
homes at an early age and placed in convents solely consecrated
to their instruction and training. One of these institutions,
located at Cuzco, was for the girls of royal blood.
In the other provinces they were for the girls of the higher
and inferior nobles, and occasionally a girl of remarkable
beauty from among the common people was placed among
the inmates.

These girls were put in charge of old, reliable women, who[Pg 45]
had spent many years in the convents. They taught the girls
how to spin and to weave the hangings for the temples. They
prepared the apparel for the ruler and his people. They
were instructed in their religious duties, one of these being
the watching over the sacred fires.

When the girls entered the convents they were shut entirely
away from the world, not even being permitted to see
or to hear from their friends and relatives. Morality was
carefully inculcated. If one of the young women should be
caught in an intrigue, she was buried alive, her lover was
strangled, and his native town razed to the ground.

No one was allowed to enter these convents except the
king and his lawful queen. The institutions were inspected
each year by persons sent for that purpose, who made a report
of what they noted on their visits.

The buildings themselves were as finely furnished as were
the palaces of the Incas and the temples, as they were for the
accommodation of the Daughters of the Sun and so were in
especial charge of the state.

When these young women reached a marriageable age, the
most beautiful among them were chosen to become brides of
the ruler, others were given by him as wives to the higher
nobles, while others remained in the service of religion, vowing
perpetual virginity, and who were held in the very
highest respect.


Human Sacrifice. Human sacrifice was of rare event in
Peru. This only occurred to mark some great public affair.
The victims usually were children and beautiful maidens.
They were selected from the various parts of the empire and
they travelled in regular convoys, the children too young to
walk being carried by their mothers. As they journeyed they
received the adoration of all the people on the way. In
offering them up as sacrifices, the priests strangled them or
broke their necks with a stone implement, while with some
the throat was cut and blood from the wound sprinkled on
their faces. In some cases the hearts of the victims were
plucked out and offered to the divinity. These sacrifices
were never served up at feasts, as in Mexico, but all were
buried in special cemeteries. Human sacrifice never came
to be a great part of the religion of Peru under the Incas,
as was the case in Mexico, and where it did occur there was
never any cannibalism with it.


Industries. Agriculture was the main occupation of the[Pg 46]
ancient Peruvians. Every one was required to put in some
time in agricultural pursuits unless excused by special permit
by the authorities. The land was divided into three parts,
one portion was reserved for the Sun, to be used to produce
revenue to care for the temples and the priests and others
connected with the religion, a second part was reserved for
the state, and the third part was given over to the people for
their own use, each head of a family receiving a plot and
additional plots for each unmarried child. There were no
animals for use in the fields, so the people had all the work
to do. The men used a digging-stick, which was a long stake
with a sharpened point, sometimes having the point covered
with copper, and with a cross stick about a foot up from the
pointed end for a foot-rest for digging with the foot. The
men would turn up the soil with their digging-sticks and the
women would follow and break up the clods with a rake and
pull out the weeds. The men unable to dig and the boys acted
as scare-crows or used blow-guns and slings to keep the birds
away. Every bit of ground was cultivated and to add to
this terraces were formed on the hillsides by means of parallel
walls of rough stones, one above the other. To add further
to the area of tillable land, where the soil was rocky and
dry they would make excavations, sometimes as much as an
acre in extent and sunk to the depth of fifteen or twenty feet,
and would line these with walls of adobe, sun-dried bricks.
The bottom of the pits probably reached down to where there
was some moisture and they were prepared for cultivation
as the other fields.

As is well known, much of the coast region of the country
which was occupied by the empire of the ancient Peruvians
is arid, as the prevailing winds are from the east and
the moisture is taken from them by the high Andes mountains,
and thus the rivers are few and with but little water in
them, often dry for a long time, and there is but little rainfall,
if at all. In order to overcome this lack of moisture and to
add to the fertile area of the country, the Peruvians built
reservoirs and aqueducts. These aqueducts were sometimes
above ground and sometimes underground and some were
quite long, one at least having been between four and five hundred
miles in length and twelve feet deep and wide. As they
did not use the arch they could not well cross depressions or
streams and had to make long detours, and sometimes they
tunneled in the mountains for the passages. They had sluices[Pg 47]
by means of which the water could be turned on to the land
and they were very careful in allowing the right amount of
water to be used on the fields. The construction of these
aqueducts, and other great buildings, is all the more remarkable
when it is considered that these people had no iron
tools of any kind whatever.

They were acquainted with the principle of fertilizing the
crop. A small sardine-like fish was abundant along the coast,
which they caught and often placed with the grains of maize
in the holes in planting. Guano, the deposit of sea-fowls on
the islands along the coast, was used in great quantity by
them, and much care was given to its proper distribution to
the different districts. No one was allowed on the islands
during the breeding season and such trespass and killing the
birds at any time were punished by death. "Inland other
forms of manure were used."20

As most of the country of the Peruvian empire lay in the
torrid zone and consisted of low coast land, elevated land,
and mountainous regions, it would have all ranges of climate,
according to elevation, and without any great changes of
temperature in any one part. Thus all kinds of agricultural
products could be cultivated, such as would be found in tropical
and temperate regions. In the warm coast region cotton
was grown in great abundance and the banana and the cassava;
in the more elevated regions the great staple produced
was maize and also manioc, guava, groundnuts, tobacco, beans,
gourds, and tomatoes; and in the higher and colder parts were
found the potato, quinoa, coca, and maguey.

Fishing was an important industry and on the coast regions
it ranked next to agriculture. They had a kind of raft, balsa,
made of bundles of reeds or poles fastened together and they
used nets, harpoons made of copper or tipped with copper,
and hooks of bone or copper. Fowling was carried on by
means of nets and quite largely engaged in especially along
the coast where there were great numbers of birds. Game
was plentiful in the mountainous regions and often great
drives were made, sometimes as many as fifty or sixty thousand
people took part in one and in which thirty thousand
head of game might have been taken. They used dogs in
hunting, having had at least two varieties of hunting dogs.
Beasts of prey, such as pumas, bears, foxes, and wild-cats
were killed. The real purpose of the hunt, though, was to[Pg 48]
capture the huanaco and vicuña, from which the wool was
cut and then the greater part of them, the females and best
males, were turned loose to let the wool grow for another year,
some being kept for food. Besides these wild animals, they
kept great flocks of llamas and alpacas, the alpaca having
been raised for its wool and the llama for a beast of burden,
for its wool, and also for its flesh for eating.

The Peruvians excelled in the art of weaving. They
made cloth, tapestry, gauze, and embroidery. They used cotton
and wool for the most part, although there was a thread
made from the fiber of the maguey. One of the principal
occupations of the women was the preparation of the thread
for weaving. In the early times it would seem that the loom
was unknown but at the time of the entrance of the Spaniards
into the country the work was done by true weaving on the
loom. There were a number of designs used, variations showing
from one period to another. Various colors were used.
The patterns were woven in the material or placed on the
cloth in the form of embroidery or painted on the cloth, and
sometimes the cloth was ornamented with feathers placed on
it in the form of patterns. They also wove a double-faced
cloth in which the colors were different on the two sides.
Delicate gauzes were made in which designs were embroidered
on fine net background.

Pottery was another important industry. There were very
many designs and all kinds of utensils and the workmanship
was good. Gold was obtained from deposits in streams and
silver was mined. These metals were cast, hammered, soldered,
and inlaid, as the people were very skillful in working
with these metals and did especially fine work. They made
vases, bracelets, mirrors, necklaces, and all kinds of delicate
ornaments. Copper was greatly used, tin having been mixed
with it. They made from this various kinds of implements
and tools and weapons. They were quite skillful in wood-carving
and inlaying was widely practiced, not only on wood
but also on bone and shell and stone. They displayed skill
in stone-carving, being able to cut the hardest stones, as
emeralds and other precious stones. Their implements were
of copper or stone, as iron was not at all in use.

Money was not in use among the Peruvians and so there
was required an exchange of products. As the products of
the country varied it became necessary that ways should be
provided whereby people could have opportunity to exchange[Pg 49]
what they had for things greatly needed from other people
of a different calling. This was done by means of fairs
held throughout the empire. In the more populous places
they took place three times a month. "These fairs afforded
so many holidays for the relaxation of the industrious laborers."21


Training of the Inca and the Order of the Huaracu. "In
his early years, the royal offspring was intrusted to the care
of the amautas, or 'wise men,' as the teachers of Peruvian
science were called, who instructed him in such elements of
knowledge as they possessed, and especially in the cumbrous
ceremonial of their religion, in which he was to take a prominent
part. Great care was also bestowed on his military
education, of the last importance in a state which, with its
professions of peace and good will, was ever at war for the
acquisition of empire.

"In this military school he was educated with such of the
Inca nobles as were nearly of his own age; for the sacred
name of Inca       a fruitful source of obscurity in their annals       was
applied indifferently to all who descended by the male
line from the founder of the monarchy. At the age of sixteen
the pupils underwent a public examination, previous to
their admission to what may be called the order of chivalry.
This examination was conducted by some of the oldest and
most illustrious Incas. The candidates were required to show
their prowess in the athletic exercises of the warrior; in
wrestling and boxing, in running such long courses as fully
tried their agility and strength, in severe fast of several days'
duration, and in mimic combats, which, although the weapons
were blunted, were always attended with wounds, and sometimes
with death. During this trial, which lasted thirty days,
the royal neophyte fared no better than his comrades, sleeping
on the bare ground, going unshod, and wearing a mean
attire       a mode of life, it was supposed, which might tend to
inspire him with more sympathy with the destitute. With all
this show of impartiality, however, it will probably be doing
no injustice to the judges to suppose that a politic discretion
may have somewhat quickened their perceptions of the real
merits of the heir-apparent.

"At the end of the appointed time, the candidates selected
as worthy of the honors of their barbaric chivalry were presented
to the sovereign, who condescended to take a principal[Pg 50]
part in the ceremony of the inauguration. He began with a
brief discourse, in which, after congratulating the young
aspirants on the proficiency they had shown in martial exercises,
he reminded them of the responsibilities attached to
their birth and station, and, addressing them affectionately
as 'children of the Sun,' he exhorted them to imitate their
great progenitor in his glorious career of beneficence to mankind.
The novices then drew near, and, kneeling one by one
before the Inca, he pierced their ears with a golden bodkin;
and this was suffered to remain there till an opening had been
made large enough for the enormous pendants which were
peculiar to their order, and which gave them, with the Spaniards,
the name of orejones. This ornament was so massy in
the ears of the sovereign that the cartilage was distended by
it nearly to the shoulder, producing what seemed a monstrous
deformity in the eyes of the Europeans, though, under the
magical influence of fashion, it was regarded as a beauty
by the natives.

"When this operation was performed, one of the most venerable
of the nobles dressed the feet of the candidates in the
sandals worn by the order, which may remind us of the
ceremony of buckling on the spurs of the Christian knight.
They were then allowed to assume the girdle or sash around
the loins, corresponding with the toga virilis of the Romans,
and intimating that they had reached the season of manhood.
Their heads were adorned with garlands of flowers, which,
by their various colors, were emblematic of the clemency and
goodness that should grace the character of every true warrior;
and the leaves of an evergreen plant were mingled with
the flowers, to show that these virtues should endure without
end. The prince's head was further ornamented by a fillet,
or tasselled fringe, of a yellow color, made of the fine threads
of the vicuña wool, which encircled the forehead as the peculiar
insignia of the heir-apparent. The great body of the
Inca nobility next made their appearance, and, beginning
with those nearest of kin, knelt down before the prince and
did him homage as successor to the crown. The whole assembly
then moved to the great square of the capital, where
songs and dances and other public festivities closed the important
ceremonial of the huaracu."22


Education. Education in ancient Peru was wholly reserved
for the nobility. The common people were treated[Pg 51]
very kindly by the ruling class, but it was the theory of their
government that the masses were only children and must be
treated as such. The following from one of their leading
sovereigns portrays this idea: "Science was not intended
for the people; but for those of generous blood. Persons of
low degree are only puffed up by it, and rendered vain and
arrogant. Neither should such meddle with the affairs of
government; for this would bring high offices into disrepute,
and cause detriment to the state."23

The youth of the nobility were placed under "wise men,"
who were the only ones having sufficient learning to do such
work. The youth were trained for the especial kind of
duties they were to perform in after life. They were taught
the laws of their country, the principles of government, and
were well grounded in the use of their mother tongue. Those
who were to enter into a religious life were carefully instructed
in regard to the rites and ceremonies of the religion
of the country. All were made familiar with the use of
the quipus.

The quipus were used for counting and computing numbers.
The quipu was a cord near two feet long, made of
threads of different colors twisted together and having smaller
threads hanging from them like fringe. These threads were
of different colors with knots in them which served instead of
ciphers in computing. Sometimes the threads represented
abstract ideas, as, white stood for peace, red for war, and,
again they represented concrete objects, as, white was for
silver, yellow for gold.

CHAPTER III

THE CHILD IN EGYPT



The Country. The desert stretching across Africa from the
Atlantic Ocean on the west extends into Western Asia and in
its whole extent it is broken only in one place and that is
the long, narrow valley made by the Nile river. In this
valley snow and frost are unknown and the chief characteristic
of the climate is its combined warmth and dryness.
There is but little rainfall throughout this region and yet
there is abundance of moisture, which comes from the annual
overflow of the Nile, and which overflow also greatly enriches
the soil. The deserts surrounding Egypt and the cataracts
of the Nile at its southern border isolated this country so
that it was not readily disturbed by outside peoples. This
isolation, with the warm climate and the productive soil, gave
just the conditions necessary for the development of mankind
in its early times and thus arose a people in this region
which developed into a great nation, extending from about
5,000 years before Christ down to its overthrow by the Persians
in 525 B.      C. The country was divided into Upper
Egypt, the principal city of which was Thebes, Middle Egypt,
with Memphis as the principal city, and Lower Egypt, which
included the Delta, its chief city being Heliopolis.

From the cataracts on the South to the Mediterranean Sea
the Nile pursues its course for over five hundred miles, till
within sixty miles of its mouth it divides into branches and
forms the part called the Delta. The cultivable land, depending
upon the extent of the inundation, averages about
five and a half miles in width, varying from two miles in its
narrowest part to ten and three-quarters in its widest part,
including the river. On the west of the valley is a range of
hills, which protects it from the sand of the desert, and on
the east, between the Nile and the Red Sea, is also another
range of hills. Lying at the foot of the hills is a strip of
sand, sometimes as great as two and a half miles in breadth,
which is not reached by the inundation and consequently re[Pg 53]mains
a waste. The demarcation between this waste and the
fertile soil is very marked, so as to be readily noted. The
rock in these hills varies, at the southern extremity being
found the granite, from which were cut out their monoliths
and made into obelisks and collossi; further north is found
sandstone of various colors, and from which were built the
palaces and temples of that region; and following this district
is a part wherein there is a limestone formation, in which
region are found the pyramids, mostly composed of this
stone.


The People. The ancient Egyptians, although in Africa,
were not from African races but were of Asiatic descent, as
the formation of their skulls, their features, their hair, and
their language, show that they were of a Caucasian race.
"The Egyptians appear to have been among the darkest races
with which the Greeks of the early times came into direct contact.... The
hair was usually black and straight. In
no case was it 'woolly,' though sometimes it grew in short,
crisp curls.... The forehead was straight, but somewhat
low; the nose generally long and straight, but sometimes
slightly aquiline. The lips were over-full; but the
upper lip was short, and the mouth was seldom too wide.
The chin was good, being well-rounded, and neither retreating
nor projecting too far. The most marked and peculiar
feature was the eye, which was a long, narrow slit, like that
of the Chinese, but placed horizontally and not obliquely.
An eyebrow, also long and thin, but very distinctly pencilled,
shaded it. The coloring was always dark, the hair, eyebrows,
eyelashes, and beard (if any) being black, or nearly so, and
the eyes black or dark brown.

"In form the Egyptian resembled the modern Arab. He
was tall; his limbs were long and supple; his head was well
placed upon his shoulders; his movements were graceful; his
carriage dignified. In general, however, his frame was too
spare; and his hands and feet were unduly large. The
women were as thin as the men, and had forms nearly similar.
Children, however, appear to have been sufficiently plump;
but they are not often represented."24

The people were divided into classes and although the separation
of the classes was very marked and distinct, yet there
was really no rigid caste system, as the boundaries were
crossed by people ascending from a lower class into a higher.[Pg 54]
Of course, as with all people, it was quite customary for the
son to take up the work of his father, but, at least, in some
cases this was not compulsory. In one instance it is shown
where the occupation of architect had descended from father
to son for twenty-one generations. There is difficulty in
knowing just what were the divisions of society but at any
rate there were at least three distinct classes, which were the
priestly class, the military class, and the rest of the people.
The first two classes, from whom came the king, were exempt
from taxation. The rest of the people had to bear the burden
of the taxes, to construct the public works, to perform the
agricultural tasks, and to carry on all mechanical and other
pursuits. They had a hard time and yet the laws regarding
them seem to have been justly administered and it would appear
as if they were contented with their condition.

"The occupations of the common people in Egypt were
carefully watched by the magistrate, and no one was allowed
to live an idle life, useless to himself and to the community.
It was thought right that the industrious citizen should be
encouraged, and distinguished from the lazy or the profligate;
and in order to protect the good and detect the wicked, it was
enacted that every one should at certain times present himself
before the magistrates, or provincial governors, and give in
his name, his place of abode, his profession or employment,
and the mode in which he gained his livelihood, the particulars
being duly registered in the official report. The time of
attendance was fixed, and those from the same parish proceeded
in bodies to the appointed office, accompanied by their
respective banners, and each individual being introduced
singly to the registering clerks, gave in his statement and
answered the necessary questions."25


Slavery. Slavery has a very early date, as it is found at
the very beginning of history, which is true in Egypt as
elsewhere. The origin of slavery cannot be traced but in the
early history of Egypt it appears that the slaves came from
outside countries, gained through wars and raids and by purchase
from dealers. Many of the captives who became slaves
were placed in the service of the king and used on public
works, as the building of temples, cutting canals, raising
dykes and embankments, and the like. They were used in
private, both black and white, to do the work in the fields
and in the homes and elsewhere. They attended on guests[Pg 55]
at banquets and also were used to amuse them by singing
and dancing and in other ways.

The master had full power over his slaves, could sell them,
remove them from place to place, if they escaped could pursue
and recapture them, and do with them as he pleased, and
yet he could not wilfully murder one of them or, if so, he
himself was put to death. "The very kind treatment of
Joseph, the mode of his liberation, and his subsequent marriage
with the daughter of a freeborn Egyptian, a high functionary
of the sacerdotal order, are striking proofs of the
humanity of the Egyptians and of their indulgent conduct
toward manumitted slaves."26 At the same time, as with
slaves everywhere and at all times, no doubt they were often
cruelly treated, as is given concerning the Israelites, when
"there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not
Joseph."27


The Home. The houses in the towns varied in size, many
of one story and maybe some of four or five stories, but for
the great part not above two stories. The streets of the
towns were narrow. The poorer classes lived much in the
open air and so did not use their houses greatly. The wealthier
classes built their houses so as to be cool throughout
the summer. To keep their houses cool "a line of trees
ran parallel with the front of the house; and to prevent injuries
from cattle or from any accident, the stems were
surrounded by a low wall, pierced with square holes to admit
the air."28 The material used in constructing the houses was
crude brick, baked in the sun, a material peculiarly suited to
the climate. Wood was used for beams and doors, sometimes
for floors, and the finer imported woods for decorative purposes.

The houses were of different sizes and arrangement. Some
of the houses were small, having an open court in front, with
three or four small rooms adjoining for storing grain and
other things, and a single chamber on a second floor above
these rooms, stairs leading to it from the court. Such houses
as these small single ones probably were found only in the
country. In the towns the smaller houses were usually built
in a solid row along a street, with a courtyard, common to
several dwellings. The wealthier people had separate houses,[Pg 56]
which sometimes were quite large, covering a good deal of
ground.

Before the front door was a portico or porch, about twelve
or fifteen feet high and supported on columns of stone, or
if of wood they were stained to represent stone. There was
a large front entrance and on either side a small door, probably
for servants and ordinary use. Sometimes on the lintels
or imposts of the entrance the owner's name was written and
over the door was placed a phrase, as, "The Good House."
Inside next to the entrance was a small open court with a
receiving door for visitors, on the opposite side of which was
a door through which the master of the house came to receive
the callers. From this small court doors led to a larger
court, which was shaded by trees. The rooms of the house
were arranged on the right and left of the large court, opening
into it. The rooms on the ground floor were used chiefly
as store-rooms for furniture, goods of various kinds, wines,
oil, etc. Over the rooms on the ground floor were placed the
chambers of the upper story, with stairs leading to them.

The ceilings of the rooms were formed with rafters of the
date tree with transverse layers of palm branches or planks
and sometimes they were vaulted and made of brick and in
the houses of the rulers they might have been arched with
stone. The floors were of stone or a composition made of lime
and other materials. The doors opened inward, both of the
rooms and the outside entrance. The doors were made of
wood, often stained to imitate foreign and rare wood. They
were made of one or two valves and they turned on pins of
bronze, which were fastened to the wood with nails of the
same metal, and they were secured within by means of a bar
or bolt or with a wooden lock. The openings for the windows
were small as the cloudless sky of Egypt gave out brilliant
light and small openings let in less heat. The windows had
wooden shutters of one or two valves, opening on pins and
secured by bars and bolts, as the doors. The walls and ceilings
were stuccoed and ornamented with various devices
painted on them, being tastefully done in form and arrangement
of colors. A terrace was placed on top of the house
and covered with a roof and supported by columns, which
during the summer provided a refuge from the heat of the
day and a sleeping-place at night.

Beside these town places there were villas, which sometimes
were quite great in extent with a large mansion and[Pg 57]
beautiful gardens, watered by canals from the Nile, and all
surrounded by a wall.

The poorer classes of people sat cross-legged, crouched on
the ground, knelt on one or both knees, or sat on the heels.
Sometimes as a token of respect to superiors, the people of
the higher classes knelt or sat on the heels, but usually they
used chairs or stools or couches.

The chairs were of various kinds, some of them of elegant
form and made of ebony and other fine woods, inlaid with
ivory, and covered with rich stuffs. Beside the single chair,
they had a double chair for two persons, which often was
reserved for the master and mistress of the house, and occasionally
offered to guests. Most of the chairs had backs, some
had a raised piece at the back, while others were made in
the form of camp-stools. They were usually about as high
as they are now, but some of the chairs were quite low, the
seat sometimes being as low as eight inches from the floor.
The legs were usually made in imitation of those of an animal,
as, of the lighter chairs like the legs of an antelope, of the
heavier like those of a lion. In the finer chairs bars were not
used to unite the legs. The seats were made of wood or
leather and sometimes of interlaced string or leather thongs,
over which a cushion was placed.

The finer stools were very much as the chairs, of fine workmanship
and of rare woods inlaid with ivory. Some of the
cheaper ones had solid sides while others had three legs. They
had footstools with open or closed sides, covered with leather
or interlaced string, as with the chairs. They used couches,
some of which were most beautiful in form and workmanship.
They used mats and carpets and rugs.

The tables of the Egyptians were round, square, or oblong.
They were generally made of wood, although some were of
stone or metal. The smaller tables often had but one support,
in the center, while the larger ones had three or four legs or
were made with solid sides. In sleeping, for the head they
used a low half cylinder, usually of wood, sometimes of pottery
or stone, some of the wooden ones being made of rare
woods and ornamented. The poorer people slept on mats on
the floor but probably the wealthier people had bedsteads
made in wicker form of palm branches and some, perhaps,
were of wood and bronze.


Women and Marriage. We find the women having considerable
power in ancient Egypt. They had full control of[Pg 58]
the home, as it appears that the husband entered the house
of his wives, rather than the wives to have entered his.
Royal authority and supreme direction of affairs were intrusted
without reserve to women. The women went often
into public, at some of the public festivals they were even
expected to attend with their husbands. Even greater privileges
were accorded to the women of the middle and lower
classes as they often went and came as they liked.

Plurality of wives was allowed, except in the case of priests,
who by law were permitted but one wife. Yet the Egyptians
generally restricted themselves to one wife. Marriage of
brother and sister was permitted and seemingly encouraged
from a religious point of view.

Although in most cases they might not have had but one
wife, yet they had concubines. These appear to have been
obtained mostly in war or bought as slaves from foreign dealers,
not for most part being native Egyptian women. These
concubines were both white and black, but the black were
used as domestics in the family. Sometimes the white concubine
took a prominent part in the family, ranking next to the
wives and children.

All the children born to a father were considered legitimate
whether the offspring of a wife or of some other woman, but
those who were born of a brother and sister in legitimate
marriage took precedence of those whose mother was of inferior
rank or a slave.

The people of old Egypt held strong opinions on the behavior
of their women and so punished adultery very severely.
A woman detected in adultery had her nose cut off, as it
was thought this would be a severe blow to her charms and
so make her less attractive. The man was condemned to
receive a bastinado of one thousand blows. If a man used
force toward a free woman he was very cruelly punished.


Child and Parent. The Egyptians were very fond of their
children. Even the most consequential pontiff did not affect
indifference toward them. They cared for the children and
did not permit the father to have any right over the life of
his offspring. The punishment for child-murder was very
severe. They did not take the life of the offender, but gave
to him a punishment which would well portray to him the
heinousness of the crime. In the case of the killing of a child,
it was ordered that the corpse of the child be fastened to the
neck of the parent offending, and for three entire days and[Pg 59]
nights was the embrace of the dead child to continue, under
the watchful eyes of a public guard. The murder of a parent
was considered the most wicked of all crimes. In this case
the criminal was sentenced to be lacerated with sharpened
reeds and after being thrown on thorns he was burnt to
death. In case a pregnant woman was sentenced to death,
the punishment did not take place till after the birth of the
child, both because they thought it wrong to take the life of
an innocent being and also they did not wish to deprive the
father of the child, which might become his support in later
life.

Children were taught to pay great respect to old age. The
children's greatest duty was respect for and care of parents.
This was just as binding among the upper classes as with
the lower. This was carried up even to the very highest, as
the sons of the king acted as fan-bearers to him, and they
also walked on foot behind his chariot in triumphal processions.


Dress. The lower orders of the Egyptian people dressed
in a very simple manner. The men wore a sort of apron, or
kilt, held at the waist by a girdle or sash, or else short drawers,
extending half way to the knees. Sometimes the apron
was simply bound round the loins and lapped over in front.
When at heavy labor the men would even wear less clothing,
as they would use the girdle about the body at the waist and
fasten to it in front a roll of linen and pass this between the
legs and fasten it to the girdle at the back. The men of the
higher orders used the apron also and wore over it a dress
which extended to the ankles and had large sleeves. Sometimes
this dress was fringed on the border around the legs.
Over this for cool weather they wore a woolen cloak. Sometimes
they wore over the apron a skirt with short sleeves and
over this a loose robe with the right arm left exposed. As a
distinguishing mark, the princes wore a peculiar badge at the
side of the head, which descended to the shoulders and was
frequently adorned and terminated with a gold fringe.

The women of the lower classes usually wore a loose robe
or shirt, with tight or full sleeves, fastened at the neck with
a string, and over this they wore a sort of petticoat with a
girdle about it at the waist, and, often while at hard work,
this costume was further simplified by their wearing merely
the loose shirt or robe and going barefooted. The women of
the higher orders wore a petticoat, or gown, held by a colored[Pg 60]
sash at the waist or by straps over the shoulders, and over
this they wore a large loose robe, with full sleeves and tied
in front below the breast. Slaves and servants were not
allowed to dress as their mistresses. They wore a long tight
gown, tied at the neck, with short sleeves, reaching nearly to
the elbows. When entertaining guests by dancing or otherwise
at banquets and the like, these women wore over their
dress a long loose robe and strings of beads around their hips.

The material used for the clothing was sometimes cotton
but linen was preferred. Wool was used for cloaks for
colder weather. Some of the material was of very fine texture,
this being particularly true of the linen. There was a
great variety of patterns in brilliant colors. In some of the
striped patterns, the stripes were of gold threads, alternating
with red lines as a border. The most elegant stuff and beautiful
patterns were reserved for the robes of the deities and
the dresses of queens.

The men of ancient Egypt shaved the head and face, never
letting the hair grow except when they were in mourning.
Women, on the contrary, never had their hair cut off, even
in mourning or after death. They wore their hair long and
plaited, generally in a triple plait, the ends being left loose;
but more usually two or three plaits were fastened together
at the ends by a woolen string of the same color as the hair,
and falling around the head to the shoulders. An ornamental
fillet was bound around the head and fastened with a lotus
bud, which fell over the forehead. The plaits of hair at the
side were held in place by a comb or band and sometimes a
round stud or pin was thrust into them at the front. The
male slaves had their heads and faces shaved as their masters.
The female slaves generally bound their hair at the back of
the head into a sort of loop; sometimes they arranged it
in long plaits at the back and at the sides of the neck and
face.

The men wore wigs both within the house and without.
Sometimes the whole wig was of plaited hair, sometimes the
upper portion was of curled hair and the lower part of plaited
hair, and again the whole wig was of short locks of equal
length. Too, cheap wigs were made in woolen and other
stuffs in imitation of hair. "The wig was worn by every
gentleman; and though it might appear ill-suited to a hot
climate, the interlaced texture of the ground to which the
hair was fastened, and the protection of this last against the[Pg 61]
sun, rendered it a most effective, and at the same time the
coolest, kind of covering for the head."29

"The most singular custom of the Egyptians was that of
tying a false beard under the chin, which was made of plaited
hair, and of a peculiar form, according to the person by whom
it was worn. Private individuals had a small beard, scarcely
two inches long; that of a king was of considerable length,
square at the bottom; and the figures of gods were distinguished
by its turning up at the end. No man ventured to
assume, or affix to his image, the beard of a deity; but after
their death it was permitted to substitute this divine emblem
on the statues of kings, and all other persons who were judged
worthy of admittance to the Elysium of futurity, in consequence
of their having assumed the character of Osiris, to
whom the souls of the pure returned on quitting their earthly
abode."30

Both men and women wore sandals, which often were carefully
and beautifully made. They were made of leather, and
lined with cloth, or of palm leaves, papyrus stalks, or other
similar materials in a sort of woven or interlaced work. Some
were pointed and turned up in front, some had a sharp flat
point, while still others were nearly round.

The Egyptians liked ornaments very much. They used
gold and silver and precious stones, and also cheaper materials
were used in imitation of these. Women wore earrings, some
quite large. The women seem to have been exceedingly fond
of rings, sometimes wearing two or three on the same finger,
often wearing them on every finger of the left hand and at
the same time on a finger or two of the right hand, and they
even wore a ring on the thumb. They wore anklets. Both
men and women wore armlets, bracelets, and necklaces.

The men carried walking-sticks. These were of various
lengths, running from three to six feet. Some had a knob
at the top while others had a peg projecting from the side.
On entering a house the sticks were left at the door or in the
hall. Where a party was being given, sometimes a poor man
was employed by the master of the house to hold the sticks
of the guests. Quite often the name of the owner was written
in hieroglyphics on the stick.

For improving their appearance, the ladies of ancient
Egypt used paints and cosmetics. They applied kohl to the[Pg 62]
eyes, they used ointment on the body, the ointment having
been scented in various ways, they stained the fingers with
red henneh and the eyelids with a moistened powder of a
black color. They kept the paints and ointments in bottles
and boxes and vases of various forms and materials, some
being ornamented. They had pins and needles. Some of the
needles were of bronze and from three to three and a half
inches in length. Some of the pins were seven or eight inches
in length, with or without heads, used for arranging the
plaits or curls of the hair. They had combs, usually of wood,
about four inches long and six wide, some being double with
small teeth on one side and large teeth on the other side.
They had mirrors of mixed metal, chiefly copper, carefully
made and highly polished, nearly round in form, and with
handles of wood, stone, or metal.

These people were of cleanly habits, both men and women.
As was given before, the men kept the head and face wholly
shaved. They used warm and cold baths. "The priests were
remarkable for their love of cleanliness, which was carried
so far that they shaved the whole body every three days, and
performed frequent daily ablutions, bathing twice a day and
twice during the night."31


Food and Drink. Beef and goose constituted the principal
part of the animal food throughout Egypt, yet the cow
was held sacred and forbidden to be eaten.32 Among the animals
used for food were the ox, kid, wild goat, and gazelle.
Of fowls there were the goose and duck, the widgeon and
quail and other wild birds. There were fish in plenty. They
had a variety and abundance of vegetables, among them being
onions, garlic, lentils, beans, cucumbers, and melons. The
lotus, papyrus, and other plants that grew abundantly along
the Nile furnished the greatest food for the poorer people.
Among the grains they had wheat, barley, and durra. Of
the fruits were dates, figs, pomegranates, olives, almonds,
peaches, and grapes.

For grinding the grain they had a mill of two circular
stones, the lower one fixed and the upper one arranged to
turn on a pivot. The grinding was done by a woman turning
the upper stone by a handle, the grain being poured through
an opening in the center of the upper stone so as to get between
the stones to be crushed and ground. The same kind[Pg 63]
of a mill was made on a larger scale and turned by animals.
The better classes used bread made from wheat while the
poorer people used cakes of barley or durra flour.

Dinner probably came at midday and supper in the evening.
It would seem that they washed before the meal as well
as after partaking of it. A napkin was presented to each
person for wiping the mouth after drinking. It was their
custom to sit together about a table at their meals, as we do
now. Men and women sat together, although sometimes the
sexes were entertained separately in a different part of the
room, on which occasion the master and the mistress of the
house sat close together on two chairs or on a double chair
at the upper end of the room. Water, cooled in porous bottles,
or wine was served to the guests. Knives were used
for the carving of a large joint and spoons were provided
the guests, for soups and other liquids, but they did not have
knives or forks, so they ate with their fingers, each one dipping
his bread into a dish placed in their midst, one after
another according to rank as guests.

"The Egyptians, a scrupulously religious people, were
never remiss in expressing their gratitude for the blessings
they enjoyed, and in returning thanks to the gods for that
peculiar protection they were thought to extend to them and
to their country, above all nations of the earth. They therefore
never sat down to meals without saying grace; and
Josephus says that when the seventy-two elders were invited
by Ptolemy Philadelphus to sup at the palace, Nicanor requested
Eleazer to say grace for his countrymen, instead of
those Egyptians, to whom that duty was committed on other
occasions."33

"It was a custom of the Egyptians, during (or according to
Herodotus after) their repasts, to introduce a wooden image
of Osiris, from one foot and a half to three feet in height, in
the form of a human mummy, standing erect, as Plutarch
informs us, in a case, or lying on a bier, and to show it to
each of the guests, warning him of his mortality, and of the
transitory nature of human pleasures. He was reminded
that some day he would be like that figure; that men ought
'to love one another, and avoid those evils which tend to
make them consider life too long, when in reality it is too
short'; and while enjoying the blessings of this world, to
bear in mind that their existence was precarious, and that[Pg 64]
death, which all ought to be prepared to meet, must eventually
close their earthly career."34

Wine was their favorite beverage and they had several
different kinds of it. They indulged in it very freely and
there were no restrictions on its use by individuals. It was
used by all classes of the people, by the priests, furnished to
soldiers, offered to the gods, and prescribed as medicine.
Women, both young and old, were permitted to have wine,
and it would appear as if there were no restrictions as to
their use of it.

The Egyptians also had beer, which was made from barley,
and as they did not grow hops they used lupins, skirret, and
an Assyrian root for flavoring it.35 "Besides beer, the
Egyptians had what Pliny calls factitious, or artificial, wine,
extracted from various fruits, as figs, myxas, pomegranates,
as well as herbs, some of which were selected for their medicinal
properties."36

There were excesses in drinking committed by people of
all classes, both men and women. At the banquets of the
rich stimulants were sometimes used to excite to further
drinking, the cabbage having been one of the vegetables used
for such purpose.


Food and Clothing of Children. Swaddling clothes do not
seem to have been used by the Egyptians as they were among
the Jews and some other nations. If the child could not
walk, he was carried by the nurse or mother before her or
at her side, in a shawl thrown around her back over a shoulder.
It was the custom, no matter whether the child had
little or no clothing on, to have a string of beads about the
neck, having occasionally a charm suspended in the center,
a symbol of truth and justice. These were for the purpose
of keeping ill luck from the child, and to make him wise and
virtuous.

"The dresses of children of the lower classes were very
simple; and, as Diodorus informs us, the expenses incurred
in feeding and clothing them amounted to a mere trifle.
'They feed them,' he says, 'very lightly, and at an incredibly
small cost; giving them a little meal of the coarsest and cheapest
kind, the pith of the papyrus, baked under the ashes, with[Pg 65]
the roots and stalks of some marsh weeds, either raw, boiled,
or roasted; and since most of them are brought up, on account
of the mildness of the climate, without shoes, and indeed
without any other clothing, the whole expense incurred
by the parents does not exceed 20 drachmæ (about 13 shillings)
each; and this frugality is the true reason of the
populousness of Egypt.' But the children of the higher orders
were often dressed like grown persons, with a loose robe
reaching to the ankles, and sandals."37


Industries. The ancient Egyptians engaged in many industries
and reached a high stage in the development of their
country and their own powers. The country was immensely
rich, as was shown from the objects of luxury found among
them, and they loved pomp and splendor. Their accomplishments
come to us from the accounts of ancient writers and
are depicted through sculptures and paintings found upon
the walls of temples, palaces, and tombs, and remains of their
work still exist sufficient to show the great things they did.

The life of ancient Egypt depended upon the annual rise
of the Nile, caused by the rains and melting of snow on the
mountains in the interior of Africa. This rise begins in
June, reaches the highest point in September, remains stationary
a few days, then recedes, and by December the flood
is past. This inundation, spreading over the whole country,
left the land covered with a rich dressing so that no further
fertilizing was necessary and made ancient Egypt probably
the most fertile tract of country in the world. This rising of
the Nile produced a line of industries, such as the building
of canals and dykes and irrigation works as well as the
greatest industry of all, that of agriculture.

Because of the favorable conditions in Egypt, as mentioned
above, and the dense population, agriculture was the
principal industry. So efficient did the people become in
this and the agricultural laborers were so frugal in their
mode of living that there was a great surplus of products
each year, which gave Egypt advantages which no other
country possessed, giving them the balance of trade with
other nations. The principal grains were wheat, barley, and
durra. Beside these grains they grew beans, peas, and lentils,
clovers, lupins, and vetches, flax and cotton, various
medicinal herbs, and of vegetables, garlic, leeks, onions,[Pg 66]
endive, radishes, melons, cucumbers, and lettuce, in fact, a
very large number and a great variety of plants.

As soon as the water began to subside and land to appear,
they began preparing to sow the grain. On the highlands
right along the river this would generally be in October and
the other parts following. The wheat and the barley were
sown about November, the barley ordinarily ripening in about
four months and the wheat in five. The durra was usually
sown about April, as an after-crop when the wheat and the
barley had been cut and taken off the ground. The ground
was prepared by means of a very rude plow, but more often
by the hoe. The seed was sown broadcast over the surface
of the land. It would appear as if neither harrow nor rake
was used to cover in the grain, but it was left as it fell on the
ground to germinate. As was stated before, the water of
the overflow of the Nile was carried by means of canals
throughout Egypt and retained for irrigating the land.
When the land was elevated, as along the banks of the Nile,
they used the shadoof, a contrivance somewhat like the old
well-sweep and bucket, to lift up the water from the river
or wells to be poured over the soil. When crops were raised
late in the year or on soil not covered by the Nile, they sometimes
used fertilizing substances, as nitrous earth and some
other kinds of dressing. In harvesting the wheat was cut
a little ways below the grain with a toothed sickle and placed
in baskets and carried to the threshing-floor, on which it
was deposited and cattle driven over it to tread out the grain.
It was then winnowed with wooden shovels and put in sacks
and taken to the granary.

Of the domestic animals were cattle, sheep, goats, hogs,
horses, asses, camels, cats, and dogs. The cat was a favorite
animal among the ancient Egyptians. They never allowed
a cat to be killed purposely, cared for them when ill, and
embalmed them when dead. Dogs also were well considered
by them and they had several breeds of them. They had
learned the artificial process of hatching eggs and built ovens
expressly for that purpose. There were great flocks of sheep
and they were well taken care of, great attention having
been given to their proper food in the various seasons and
they were carefully treated when ill. The skill of the Egyptians
in curing animals had reached a high stage.

Hunting was an industry as well as an amusement. There
were quite a number of different animals that they hunted.[Pg 67]
They used the bow and arrow and other weapons and also
the net, which in hunting large animals was placed across
ravines and the like to keep them from escaping. They
hunted with dogs and they even had cats trained to hunt
with. The Egyptians were expert fowlers, using for the
most part nets and traps for catching the birds. The Nile
was celebrated for its fish and fishing was an important industry.
The net was greatly used in fishing and the rod and
line and spear were also used. Salted as well as fresh fish
were used as food.

There were a great number of people engaged in manufactures
and many different trades were found among the
ancient Egyptians. Whether each one was compelled by
law to follow the trade of his father, it is probable that
most of them did, so that often they were able to trace
back the occupation in the family for many generations.
It is probable that each craft had its own particular part
of the city set aside for it wherein its members dwelt and
carried on their particular work and which was called after
it, as, the quarter of the goldsmiths, and so on. The workmen
became very proficient in their work and a number of
inventions were made which are the same as we have now,
among some of the implements invented being the forceps,
bellows, blow-pipe, and siphon.

They were celebrated for their manufacture of cloths,
having made such of cotton, wool, and linen. They were
woven on hand looms, some of which were vertical and others
horizontal and must have been of considerable size, as they
wove cloth five feet wide and at least sixty feet in length.
The spinning and weaving was the work of women, although
men did sometimes engage in this work. They colored the
cloths, using dyes and paints, and varied the colors in them,
making patterns and showing figures of animals and the like.
Whether they understood the principle of the action of mordants,
they used this agency to make the cloth take the color
equally and also to change the hues.

Glass was known to the Egyptians and from it they made
bottles, vases, and other utensils, beads and other ornaments,
and they were quite skillful in the use of glass in counterfeiting
the amethyst and other precious stones. They had
glazed ware a long time before they used glass. There were
quite a large number of people engaged in pottery work and
they were quite skillful in the manufacture of this ware.[Pg 68]
There were many varieties and forms of their work and it
included rough unglazed ware up to fine glazed vases, highly
decorated and colored. There were bottles not only of glass
and earthenware but also of leather and of stone and there
were glass bottles enclosed in wicker-work and others encased
in leather. There were all kinds of vases, earthenware,
stone, bronze, alabaster, glass, porcelain, ivory, bone, silver,
and gold. Some of the vases were most beautiful in make and
design, inlaid with precious stones and tastefully ornamented.

There was quite an industry in metal working among them.
There was probably very little of any kinds of metals found
in Egypt, having been brought in from other countries.
Gold was early used for the making of ornaments. They
soon found a way of hardening gold by alloying it with silver.
They learned to work gold in various ways. They cast
it into figures, molded it into beads by pressure, soldered it,
drew it out into wire, used it in plaiting, beat it out into
sheets for gilding, engraved it and inlaid it with precious
stones. Silver came into use later than gold and in early
times it was scarcer than gold. Copper was greatly in use
among the ancient Egyptians and by alloying it with tin produced
bronze. They made many utensils and implements of
it and learned to make it so hard as to be used for woodcutting
tools and chisels for cutting limestone. Lead was
used by them, as was also tin and antimony. Iron was perhaps
used in the early times, but it would appear that it
was not greatly in use till the time of the Greeks and the
Romans in Egypt.

They were quite skillful in working in wood and there was
a large class of wood-workers, divided into carpenters, cabinet-makers,
wheelwrights, coopers, coffin-makers, and boat-builders.
There was quite a good deal more wood in Egypt
in ancient times than now and yet not a great variety. The
principal trees were the date-palm, used for beams; the
Theban palm, used for rafts, and other purposes connected
with water, and for beams and rafters; the sycamore, used
for large planks for boxes, tables, doors, and the like; the
tamarisk, a hard and compact wood, used for the handles of
tools and wooden implements; and the acacia, used for planks
and masts of boats. For ornamental purposes and where
fine woods were required, they were brought in from other
countries, as, the cedar, cypress, cherry, walnut, and deal
from Syria, and ebony and other rare woods from Ethiopia.[Pg 69]

Wood was used for buildings and parts of buildings, for
furniture, boxes, barrels, chariots, traveling cars, palanquins,
coffins, statues, statuettes, and in boat-building. "Regarding
the methods of woodworking, certainly the axe was the primitive
tool, as shown by the royal architect being designated
by the axe. In the scenes of the pyramid age we find the saw
about three feet long worked with both hands, the mallet
and chisel for cutting mortise-holes, and the adze in constant
use for shaping and for smoothing wood. To this day the
small adze is a favorite tool of the Egyptian carpenter and
boat-builder. For smoothing down the caulking inside a boat,
heavy pounders of stone were used, held by a handle worked
out on each side of the block. Drills were also commonly
used both on wood and stone, worked by a bow."38

As they had only the hand-saw, in making planks they
usually placed the piece of timber upright and fastened it
to stakes and then sawed downward through it. In joining
two boards end to end, they would cut into their ends and
join them and glue them and then insert a flat wooden pin
through them from edge to edge and then pass a round
wooden pin through the boards into the flat pin, thus effectually
keeping the joints from opening and thereby showing
the thoroughness of their work. They dovetailed and
veneered and stained and painted and gilded and inlaid their
woodwork, thus displaying a high degree of skill in working
with wood.

One of the greatest industries with them was that of brick-making,
which was wholly under the control of the government
and carried on solely by it. "The use of crude bricks
baked in the sun was universal throughout the country for
private and for many public buildings, and the dry climate of
Egypt was peculiarly suited to those simple materials. They
had the recommendation of cheapness, and even of durability;
and those made 3,000 years ago, whether with or 'without
straw,' are even now as firm and fit for use as when first put
up in the reigns of the Amunophs and Thothmes, whose
names they bear. When made of the Nile mud, or alluvial deposit,
they required straw to prevent their cracking; but
those formed of clay (now called Háybeh) taken from the
torrent beds on the edge of the desert, held together without
straw; and crude brick walls frequently had the addi[Pg 70]tional
security of a layer of reeds or sticks placed at intervals
to act as binders."39

The tanning and preparation and use of leather was quite a
leading industry of ancient Egypt, so much so that a section
of the city of Thebes was set apart for the exclusive use of
the workers in skins and leather. The demand for leather
was so great Egypt itself could not supply the hides necessary
and great quantities of hides were imported from foreign
countries and also the skins of wild animals were brought
in and used. They tanned the skins and dyed them and
made some fine leather and also embossed the leather.

The tools used for working in leather were a semi-circular
knife, a sort of chisel, an awl, a stone for polishing, cutting
table, bending form, hone, and a few others. They made
shoes, sandals, coverings and seats for chairs and sofas, bow-cases,
ornaments and harness for chariots, and adornments
for harps. Skins were used to cover shields and other things
and they were shaped into forms for carrying water, wine,
and other liquids. They made thongs by twisting leather
strips together, cutting the strips from circular pieces of
leather as is done now.

The Egyptians were famed for their manufacture of paper,
which was made from the papyrus plant. This grew almost
altogether in Lower Egypt, on marshy land or in the ponds
left after the inundation of the Nile. The right of growing
and selling it belonged to the government and the particular
species from which the paper was made was closely guarded
and perhaps not allowed to grow anywhere else than in the
restricted territory in the Delta. The paper was made by
removing the outer covering of the stalk, cutting the interior
lengthwise into thin pieces and laying these together side by
side on a flat board and across them another layer, cementing
the strips together with a kind of glue, then putting all under
pressure, and after drying the paper was completed and ready
for use.

The paper made from the papyrus differed in quality according
to the growth of the plant and from which part of
the stalk the pieces were taken, the stalk growing to about
fifteen feet in height. The breadth of the paper differed,
running from six inches under an early Dynasty to fourteen
and a half inches under a later Dynasty. When a sheet of
papyrus had been used for writing, it was rolled up, and if[Pg 71]
important and to be preserved for any length of time, tied
round the middle and secured by clay stamps with a seal.
The cost of the papyrus was so great that it was used only
in funeral rituals, conveyances, deeds, and other public documents,
and sometimes the old writing was erased and then
the roll was written on again. For ordinary purposes of
writing, pieces of broken pottery, stone, board, and leather
were used.

The Nile traversing the entire length of Egypt formed a
great avenue for trade, as it was an open and easy way for
reaching all parts. Not only did the Nile give access to all
parts about it, but also the canals going out from it and
running parallel with it connected the various parts and
gave ready ways on which domestic trade could go. The
other nations bordering the Mediterranean Sea carried on
important maritime trade with Egypt and, too, there was a
great caravan trade with the interior of Africa and parts of
Asia. From Ethiopia came gold, ivory, and slaves; from
Arabia was obtained an incense necessary in the religious ceremonies;
from India were received spices. "Syria took Egyptian
chariots by hundreds; Tyre imported 'fine linen with
broidered work'; Greece, large quantities of paper; India and
Arabia, linen fabrics; Etruria, glass, porcelain, and alabaster;
Assyria, perhaps, ivories. In the earlier times Egyptian
manufactures must have been altogether unrivalled; and
their glass, their pottery, their textile fabrics, their metal-work,
must have circulated freely through the various countries
bordering the Mediterranean and the Red Sea."40

Among the important industries of Egypt were the works
in sculpture, painting, and architecture. The men engaged
in these occupations ranked high, along with the scribes.

There were three kinds of sculpture in ancient Egypt.
One kind was that of statuary, sculpture in the round, where
the complete figure was shown; a second kind was relief,
where the figure was raised from the flat surface by cutting
away the stone about it; the third kind was intaglio, in which
there was a cutting of the figure into the flat surface, sinking
the figure below the surface, and in one form of this
the cutting was done about the figure so as to leave it raised
from the interior, almost up to the level of the surface of
the stone.

The old Egyptians reached a stage of progress in which the[Pg 72]
block of stone for the sculpture figure was cut away from
the original rock and transported to the place where it was
to stand. Yet the figure was rarely if ever cut entirely away
from the stone and so did not stand forth separate, detached,
a statute in and of itself. That which most kept Egyptian
sculpture, perhaps, from reaching to the highest attainment
was the conventionality in the displaying of figures. As the
sculptures were used in the decoration of tombs and temples,
religion, which is ever conservative, prescribed certain attitudes
for the figures, so that there was not much left for
the working out by the individual sculptor, and although
there was an exactness of finish attained there was not that
expression which comes through allowing freedom to the individual
sculptor, and in consequence there is very much of
a sameness in the products of the sculptors running through
the twenty centuries of old Egypt.

As with sculpture so with painting, the conventional forms
were demanded of the painter so that although mechanical
skill became great, there was not that high artistic effect that
is attained where individuality is permitted to display itself.
The walls of buildings were not broken by windows, as the
brilliancy of light was such that few openings were necessary
and the openings let in heat. The walls on the interior
were covered with a coating of stucco, which was white or
whitish, and then decorated with paintings displaying scenes
and events in the life of the people and the nation. The
ceilings were also painted. The colors used were black and
white, red, blue, and yellow, green and brown. Columns and
other parts of buildings were also stuccoed and painted and
even the same was done with statues and other products of
the sculptors.

The early buildings in Egypt were made of brick or by
the interweaving of palm-sticks. From these rude structures
to the great temples and pyramids makes the architecture
of that country a most marked feature of its progress. The
architecture of Egypt in its rectangular form and massiveness
fits well into the nature of the land, which frames plain
and cliff about these buildings as a proper background. Yet
size is not so much the essential characteristic of this architecture
but rather strength and durability, which were the
chief features of the structures, whether large or small. Although
they were familiar with the arch and used it very
much in brickwork, yet it would appear that it was not used[Pg 73]
in the great buildings of stone, or, if so, it was hid in the
building and kept away from the external forms.41

The kinds of stone used in sculpture and architecture were
limestone, sandstone, granite, basalt, alabaster, and diorite.
The stone was cut out in blocks from the quarry, the surfaces
were picked smooth with a short adze, the blocks were then
sawn and cut with drills, and probably all prepared at the
quarry ready for use at the building. Sand was used as the
cutting material with the soft stones and emery with the
harder ones. Whether the cutting material was used as
powder or set as separate teeth on the copper saw blade
cannot be determined, yet in some instances it would appear
that the emery was set in the tool as teeth. The great problem
to us is how these stones were transported from the
quarries and set up in their places. One obelisk is estimated
to have weighed 886 tons and it was taken over-land a distance
of 138 miles. Some of the obelisks of seventy to
eighty feet in length and weighing near 300 tons each were
conveyed a distance of more than 800 miles.42 Two great collossi,
weighing 1,175 tons each, were carried upstream a distance
of 450 miles.43 It would appear that sometimes the
stone were placed on sleds and drawn by oxen down to the
river, where by an inclined plane they were placed on vessels,
while again these blocks were hauled by large bodies of
men over-land to their places of destination.

The greatest of all their buildings were the Great Temple
at Karnak and the Great Pyramid at Ghizeh. The temple
at Karnak was 1,200 feet long and 340 feet wide, with an
entire area of 396,000 square feet, and with pylons, obelisks,
and columns, and it is called "the greatest of man's architectural
works." The Great Pyramid at Ghizeh has a square
base the length of each side of which is 764 feet, covering
an area of about twelve acres. Its original perpendicular
height is estimated at about 485 feet. "The solid masonry
which it contained is estimated at more than 89,000,000 cubic
feet, and the weight of the mass at 6,848,000 tons. The basement
stones are many of them thirty feet in length and
nearly five feet high. Altogether the edifice is the largest
and most massive building in the world, and not only so,
but by far the largest and most massive       the building which[Pg 74]
approaches it the nearest being the Second Pyramid, which
contains 17,000,000 cubic feet less, and is very much inferior
in the method of its construction."44


Sickness and Death. It would appear that the study and
practice of medicine began at a very early time in Egypt.
Principles and remedies were given out from time to time
till finally they were brought together in the form of medical
works and all physicians were expected to study them
and to use the prescribed remedies. The medical skill of the
Egyptians became known to other parts of the world and
they were consulted and called to foreign countries to give
advice and treatment. They went so far as to divide the
study and practice of medicine into specialties and so there
were physicians attending to one kind of illness only, as, one
for the diseases of the eyes, another for the diseases of the
intestines, and so on, accoucheurs having been usually, if not
always, women. The physicians were given salaries by the
government and fixed by it and also they were permitted to
receive fees for their advice and attendance upon patients,
but when in military service they could not charge fees.

On account of the glaring light and the sandy plains and
the overflow of the Nile, some of the prominent troubles were
of the eyes and such as were connected with malaria. In
treatment of illness, it was held that the patient had been
attacked by some evil influence, hence to cure him was first
necessary to find what was the nature of this evil spirit and
to drive it out or to destroy it. This was the task of those
skilled in sorcery, through incantations, amulets, and the like.
Then the diseases that had been carried into the body by the
evil influences were to be cured by medicine and medical
treatment. Physicians were held responsible for their treatment
of a disease and if contrary to the established system
they were punished and the death of a patient under such circumstances
was considered a capital offense. Yet if they
had exhausted all the prescribed remedies without producing
good effect, they could prescribe new remedies and hence an
opportunity for advancement in the science of medicine. In
their practice they strove to prevent illness by directing
attention to regimen and diet; they purged the system by
use of emetics or clysters; and they used drugs and medical
herbs.

When a death occurred, all the women of the household[Pg 75]
covered their faces with dust and mud and with bosoms exposed
ran out through the streets, striking themselves and
uttering loud cries of grief. Friends and relatives joined the
procession and the demonstrations became the louder. If
the deceased person had been of wide repute, many other
people went into the line of mourners and hired mourners
were employed to increase the lamentations and thereby enlarge
the public display of respect to the dead. For seventy-two
days the mourning was carried on in the house, lamentations
were made, the funeral dirge was sung, all amusements
and indulgences were abstained from, and the men allowed
their hair and beard to grow. Thus they endeavored to show
respect to the deceased and their great affliction by his departure.

One of the great arts of the ancient Egyptians was that
of embalming. It constituted a distinct profession. The
embalmers had wooden models of mummies, displaying the
three different ways of embalming. The first way of embalming
was very expensive and was used only by the wealthy
class and people of high position; the second way was more
simple and quite less expensive and used by the middle class
of people; the third way was very simple and very cheap
and employed by the lower classes. After embalming the
body was returned to the family and put into a case and
placed in a room upright against the wall, and sometimes
they were retained by the family for quite a while before
their burial.

When the time for burial came, the mummy was put into
a coffin of wood or stone to be placed in a tomb, which may
have been hewn in the rock or built up of brick or rock and
usually on the western side of the Nile. Some of the tombs
were of great extent and highly ornamented with paintings
and sculptures and some were immense structures. The pyramids
were built for tombs. The funeral of any important personage
was a great occasion. There was much display and
much noisy lamentations and it was very costly. Upon reaching
the Nile the body was placed on the funeral barge and
the procession went out on the river to the lake of the dead.
Before the deceased could be taken across the lake for burial
he had to meet the tribunal of death. Forty-two judges were
at the bank of the lake and any one could bring accusation
against the deceased. The judges considered the accusation
and acted upon it and if the decision was acquittal then burial[Pg 76]
in the tomb took place, but if the accusation was sustained
burial was denied. The judgment was carried out on the
body of any person in the country, high or low, rich or poor,
the meanest subject or a Pharaoh, and there are instances
of deceased Pharaohs having been denied public burial.

"All the legitimate tendencies exerted by this singular institution
were obviously for good. It sent forth from the
very entrance of the tomb a most powerful persuasive to live
a life of virtue. It appealed to some of the strongest of human
motives, and enforced that appeal by the severest of all
sanctions, the exclusion of the body from its sepulchre, and
of the soul from the abodes of the blessed. It is not a little
singular that a custom apparently so salutary, and so early
introduced, should not afterwards have been adopted by other
nations."45


Child and Religion. The child played a part in the religion
of the ancient Egyptians. Even one of their gods,
Harpocrates, was represented by an infant, having his finger
to his mouth and that striking characteristic of a young child       a
protruding abdomen. The birth of a child was a matter
for thanksgiving offerings through the priests to the gods.
Herodotus says: "When parents, living in town, perform
vows for the recovery of their children's health, they offer
prayers to the deity of whom the animal is sacred, and then
shaving a portion, or half, or the whole of the child's head,
they put the hair into one scale of the balance and money
into the other until the latter outweighs the former; they
then give it to the person who takes care of the animal to
buy fish (or other food)."46

On some occasions when the sacred bull was led in procession
through the town, the procession was led by children,
and on such occasions it was thought that these children received
the gift of foretelling future events. Wilkinson gives
the following from Plutarch: "They even look upon children
as gifted with a kind of faculty of divination, and they
are ever anxious to observe the accidental prattle they talk
during play, especially if it be in a sacred place, deducing
from it presages of future events."47


Amusements. In the earlier times of ancient Egypt, as of
all nations, when the struggle for living required the putting[Pg 77]
forth of the energies and but little leisure was allowed, there
was not much time for recreation and the people were not
much given to amusements. As wealth grew and there was
leisure time, the desire for amusement and entertainment
increased until there grew up in the Egyptian character a
softness and inclination to luxurious living. Great banquets
were given, where hosts vied with one another in entertaining
lavishly and in furnishing amusement for the guests, till it
would appear as if they devised every possible kind of amusement.
Nor was the zest for amusement confined to the upper
classes, for during the inundation of the Nile, when but little
work could be done, the peasantry gave themselves up to
pastime and sport. Many of the kinds of entertainment
given at the banquets were performed on the streets and open
places.

Dancing was an indispensable entertainment at an Egyptian
party and music was required with the dance. They
danced to the music of the harp, lyre, guitar, pipe, tambourine,
and other instruments, and in the streets also to
the drum. Dancing was not done by the guests, as it was
held not to be proper for the upper classes to dance, although
the lower classes indulged in this amusement and
greatly enjoyed it. The dancing was carried on before the
guests by slaves taught the steps for that purpose or by
hired performers who made a profession of furnishing dancing
and music for festive occasions. Graceful posings and
movements and especial skill and grace in the use of the
hands were the important features of the dance. Both men
and women danced for hire, the women showing the superior
grace and elegance and the men displaying the most spirit.
The dress of the female dancers was usually a loose flowing
robe, reaching to the ankles, fastened at the waist, and around
the hips was a small narrow girdle of various colors and
ornamented with beads. The material of the dress was of a
very fine texture and thin, showing the form and movement
of the limbs in dancing.

There were various ways of dancing. Sometimes one person
danced alone, sometimes they danced in pairs, again
there were several dancers together sometimes of both sexes
and then of but one sex. Some danced to slow music, while
others preferred lively tunes, men sometimes displaying great
spirit, bounding from the ground. The aim of the dance
was to display a succession of figures in which were ex[Pg 78]hibited
a great variety of gestures. Twirling was much used
in dancing and the pirouette was quite a favorite form with
them. In one dance two parties would each dance on one
leg toward one another and perform a series of evolutions
and then retire from one another. In another step, standing
on one foot the dancer would strike the ground with
the heel, changing back and forth from one foot to the other.
The dances of the lower classes were sometimes in the form
of a pantomime, in which there was a preference shown for
the ludicrous rather than the graceful.

Music was very popular with the Egyptians and they
had both vocal and instrumental. They had numerous songs
and for various occasions. They had quite a variety of musical
instruments. Music was used in military movements, in
religious exercises, in their social functions, and in the wailing
for the dead. Music formed a part of the education of
a member of the upper classes, but he did not display this
at social functions, as that, like dancing, was given over to
professionals. Both men and women of the priestly order,
though, did render service with voice and instrument in religious
ceremonies.

"It is sufficiently evident, from the sculptures of the ancient
Egyptians, that their hired musicians were acquainted
with the triple symphony; the harmony of instruments, of
voices, and of voices and instruments. Their band was variously
composed, consisting either of two harps, with the single
pipe and flute; of the harp and double pipe, frequently
with the addition of the guitar; of a fourteen-stringed harp,
a guitar, lyre, double pipe, and tambourine; of two harps,
sometimes of different sizes, one of seven, the other of four
strings; of two harps of eight strings, and a seven-stringed
lyre; of the guitar, and the square or oblong tambourine;
of the lyre, harp, guitar, double pipe, and a sort of harp,
with four strings, which was held upon the shoulder; of the
harp, guitar, double pipe, lyre, and square tambourine; of
the harp, two guitars, and the double pipe; of the harp, two
flutes, and a guitar; of two harps and a flute; of a seventeen-stringed
lyre, the double pipe, and a harp of fourteen strings;
of the harp and two guitars; or of two seven-stringed harps
and an instrument held in the hand, not unlike an Eastern
fan, to which were probably attached small bells, or pieces
of metal that emitted a jingling sound when shaken, like the
crescent-crowned bells of our modern bands; besides many[Pg 79]
other combinations of these various instruments; and in the
Bacchic festival of Ptolemy Philadelphus, described by
Athenæus, more than 600 musicians were employed in the
chorus, among whom were 300 performers on the kithara."48

As was stated before, dwarfs and deformed persons were
attached to the households of the greater people as a means
of entertainment as in Rome and Medieval Europe. These
dwarfs and also others engaged in buffoonery for the entertainment
of guests. There were various tricks performed by
jugglers, and we find there the old cup or shell game, in
which a little ball or pea is rolled about on a board from
one inverted cup to another to guess under which it finally
rested. There were many kinds of acrobatic feats, mostly
performed by women, such as two performers swinging
around in a reckless fashion while holding hands. This was
varied by two men holding the hands of two women and whirling
them around with feet braced together. There were
tumbling exhibits of turning forward and backward on the
hands, somersaulting off one another's shoulders, and even
sometimes doing these feats while holding one foot with a
hand. There were tests of strength wherein two men would
sit back to back and each strive to rise first from the ground,
and in another test they would try who could lift the heaviest
weight or raise a bag of sand with a straight arm up over
head. They would throw knives at a board, each contestant
striving to strike his knife in the center of the board or on
a mark.

The most common indoor games were odd and even, mora,
and draughts, all of which it would appear were played in
Egypt from very ancient times. In odd or even bones,
beans, nuts, almonds, and coins were used and any indefinite
number was held between the hands, the game being to guess
whether odd or even. The game of mora was usually played
by two persons, each at the same time quickly throwing out
the fingers of one hand, then trying to guess the number
of fingers shown by both. Draughts was a favorite game
of all ranks. It was played by two people on a board similar
to the present checker-board, but the pieces were not flat,
being raised, more like the pieces in chess, and picked up
like chessmen between thumb and finger. In another game
hooked rods were used by which a small hoop was to be
snatched from one another, the skill in this was for one per[Pg 80]son
to get his hoop loose from his opponent's rod and then
snatch it away quickly before he had time to stop it. In
one game a player knelt with face toward the ground between
two others, who held over him in their closed hands shells or
dice, the number of which he was to guess before being allowed
to rise. They played with dice and probably played
several other games of chance.

Wrestling was a favorite amusement among the lower
classes. They fought with the single-stick and among the
boatmen of the Nile were conflicts with long poles. Mock
fights were common, especially with the military classes,
sometimes quite a great affair wherein a temporary fort would
be erected and attacked by a party with a battering-ram and
other implements of war and vigorously defended by the party
within the fort. There were bull fights, sometimes between
the animals and again men would fight the bulls. The animals
were carefully trained to fight and prizes were awarded
to the owner of the victorious combatant. It is pretty certain
that animals were taught to perform tricks and to dance.

All classes of the Egyptians delighted in hunting, fowling,
and fishing. In hunting they used the bow, the spear, the
lasso, and the net to place across enclosures. There were
preserves on some of the estates in which animals were kept
for hunting, but the greatest sport was hunting out on the
desert. Dogs were used and different breeds reared, some
for attacking, some for coursing, and the like. Sometimes
there would be a great hunt arranged, with beaters for
forcing the game into quarters where they could be enclosed
with nets and then hunted within. In hunting for birds
and water-fowl the real sportsman used only the throwing-stick,
which was from a foot and a quarter to two feet in
length, about one inch and a half in breadth, and slightly
curved at the upper end. The hunter would usually go out
in a boat into the places covered with tall reeds and lotuses
and gliding swiftly in among the birds, or using a decoy bird
to attract them toward him, he would cast the throwing-stick
at them as they arose and thus fell them. Often a cat would
accompany the hunter which was trained to get the birds
as they fell and bring them to the boat. In the pleasure-grounds
of villas were ponds well stocked with fish. The
fish were caught from them by hook and line. But the real
fisherman used the bident spear, which sometimes had feathers
at one end, like an arrow, but more often without, and[Pg 81]
sometimes the spear had a string attached to it to bring it
back when thrown. Running his boat over the surface of
the water, as he would see a fish he would cast his spear at it.
They prided themselves on their skill with the spear.


Games, Plays, and Toys. The children and young people
among the ancient Egyptians engaged in many sports and
they were encouraged in this by their elders, particularly in
those activities of an outdoor nature, as they were considered
to be conducive to good health through exercise of the body.
The young people took part in the singing and other music
and at least among the lower classes in the dancing. They
went out with their parents and other relatives on fishing
trips and bird hunting and the youth went with the men on
hunting trips. The youth of both sexes practiced shooting
at a target with the bow and arrow.

The game of ball was one of the great games of the Egyptians,
participated in by children and adults of both sexes,
but it appears to have been more indulged in by the women.
Some of the balls were made of leather or skin, sewed with
string, and stuffed with bran or husks of corn, some being
about three inches in diameter. In one of the favorite games
the ball was thrown and caught and the one failing had to
carry the other woman, who caught it on her back till this
one failed to catch it, when she had to do the carrying.
The women rode sidewise in short petticoats on the backs of
the losers. In another game the ball was thrown as high as
possible and the catcher would leap up and catch it before
the feet would touch the ground. Again when the ball
was thrown to them they would catch it with the hands behind
the back and even while standing on one leg.

The playthings of the little child are often found buried
with it. They had dolls of various kinds, being made of
wood, stone, and enamelled pottery. They often were painted,
the inferior ones being the most gaudily colored. Some were
of rude construction with head and body and without arms
and legs, while others were small models of the human figure.
Some were jointed, the arms and legs moving on pins. Some
had artificial hair, while others had beads in imitation of
hair hanging from the head. Some grotesque figures were
formed and by means of strings could be made to assume
various postures. One such figure was that of a crocodile
which could be made to amuse the child by its grimaces and
by the opening and closing of its mouth. Some figures of[Pg 82]
persons could be made to go through the motions of washing
and of kneading dough. One was the figure of a person with
jointed arms and legs, which could be thrown about by the
pulling of a string, and which still exists with us today in
the jumping-jack. They also had pigs, ducks, pigeons on
wheels, boats, balls, marbles, and miniature sets of household
furniture.


Education. The ancient Egyptians were very much interested
in the education of the young. It would appear that
the parent was left entire freedom in the selecting what
education and how much the child should have. In the matter
of education there seemed to be no caste whatever, as the
poor boy and son of one of the lower classes could take his
place in school by the side of the rich boy or the son of the
noble.

A clever boy in school had great opportunities, be he from
whatever class of society. He was encouraged to go on to
literary life, which meant, if successful, entering into the employ
of the government and reaching the very highest places.
Many a great nobleman so arose in Egypt and often was
found on his monument after his death: "His ancestors were
unknown people."

There were elementary schools, probably none provided by
the state, and whether there were schools or not in a community,
there were teachers to be had for the instruction of
the young. With the temples were connected higher schools
and in the capitals of the three districts of Egypt, Thebes,
Memphis, Heliopolis, the temple schools were quite important
centers of learning. The child started into the elementary
school at near five years of age and continued till he left for
work, or to enter a higher school, or else he might have gone
into the office of a scribe or physician or architect to learn
directly the work of his profession. The vast majority of the
children received very little training beyond the rudiments
of education and what instruction was given to them by their
parents in teaching them their trades. Some of the young
people continued with their schooling and entered the schools
of the temples and there came in contact with the learned
men of the state and received a higher education. A very
few of these, who displayed special aptitude for learning, were
permitted to enter into the deeper studies and to whom
was thrown open all the knowledge possessed by the wisest
men of their day. Little is known about the education of[Pg 83]
girls. As the women ranked high in Egypt and took part
in the public festivities and religious ceremonies, they must
have received such education as would prepare them for their
duties in life.

The purpose of education in ancient Egypt was to prepare
for some one of the callings of priest, scribe, architect, engineer,
physician, soldier, musician, artisan. It was necessary
to be educated to enter into office and to rise in position.
Thus the education was of a utilitarian nature. The most
important calling outside the priesthood was that of the
scribe. The scribe learned about official documents and the
management of business and to read and write the three
forms of writing       hieroglyphic, hierotic, demotic       and also
he studied ethics, philosophy, and law. The architect studied
mathematics and science and the history that would give him
a knowledge of art. The physician was taught such anatomy
and physiology as was known, remedies and incantations,
and other things pertaining to his calling. Whatever may
be considered about this education, it did give Egypt a high
place among the old nations of the world and caused its
civilization to continue through many centuries.

In the home and in the school it was impressed on the
children to be respectful to their elders. They were taught
to be careful of looks and gestures, that such should be of
a proper kind. It was not permitted to use any dance
or ode at the feasts and sacrifices that had not been passed
on by the proper authorities. The children were not permitted
to hear or to learn any verses or songs than such as
were of a virtuous giving character.

The discipline in school was quite severe. One teacher
spoke thus: "The hawk is taught to fly and the pigeon to
nest; I shall teach you your letters, you idle villain."49 A
pedagogical saying runs: "A young fellow has a back, he
hears when we strike it."

"Plato says the Egyptians taught numbers to children in
their play by distributing amongst them a certain number of
fruits, or other things, the same number to be given to many
or to few children, so that by dividing them amongst themselves
they learnt lessons in arithmetic; and all sorts of numbers
were given to them in their games and plays as arithmetical
problems."50[Pg 84]

For written work they had wooden blocks covered with
red or white stucco. Copies were engraved on wooden or
stone tablets and then the children copied them on their tablets.
Work was also given by dictation. The older pupils
wrote from dictation, or from copies, extracts from the best
writers. This trained also in penmanship and spelling. Often
the pupils copied an "instruction," which consisted of moral
precepts of an ancient writer. Often the instruction consisted
of letters between student and teacher.

CHAPTER IV

THE CHILD IN INDIA



Caste. The caste system in India was the most fixed of any
of the nations. In this way the natural divisions into which
mankind placed itself in a free country was not allowed, but
fixed and hereditary classes were formed. There were four
principal classes: The Brahmans, the priests; the Kshatriyas,
the warriors; the Vaisyas, the farmers and traders; the
Sudras, the laborers. Below these was a class of the very
lowest.

There was very little opportunity for a member of one caste
going into a higher, so that an impulse for higher striving was
of no avail, and if ever such came to a member of a lower caste
it must have soon died away. This entailed especial disadvantages
upon the children, for a boy's whole situation in life
depended upon the class to which the father belonged and,
consequently, his occupation and education. This rigid caste
system might have brought contentment to the people, as
there was no use of being discontented with one's lot, but such
contentment could not bring great progress.


Women and Marriage. In the early times in India, women
were not excluded as they were later, but they were honored
and respected. They were considered as the intellectual companion
of the husband, as helper in the daily life, and as
partaker in the religious duties. They attended the courts
and assemblies and public entertainments, being permitted to
appear freely and openly on public occasions. The change
took place when they were conquered by the Moslems, from
whom the custom of the exclusion of women was learned by
the Hindus or was thrust upon them.

The Code of Manu some three centuries before Christ set
the status of woman thus, "During her childhood a woman
depends on her father; during her youth, on her husband;
her husband being dead, on her sons; if she has no sons, on
the near relatives of her husband; or if in default of them, on
those of her father; if she has no paternal relatives, on the[Pg 86]
sovereign. A woman ought never to have her own way." So
it is no wonder that the wife was treated by the husband in
the harshest manner and she to respond with the greatest
humility. The following from a witness of a hundred or more
years ago, portrays some of the relations which women bore
to the opposite sex:

"The women, on the other hand, are so thoroughly accustomed
to harsh and domineering treatment from their husbands
that they would be quite annoyed if the husbands
adopted a more familiar tone. I once knew a native lady who
complained bitterly that her husband sometimes affected to
be devoted to her in public and allowed himself such little
familiarities as are looked upon by us as marks of affection.
'Such behavior,' said she, 'covers me with shame and confusion.
I dare not show myself anywhere. Did anyone ever
see such bad manners amongst people of our caste? Has
he become a Feringhi (European), and does he take me for
one of their vile women?'

"As a rule a husband addresses his wife in terms which
show how little he thinks of her. Servant, slave, etc., and
other equal flattering appellations, fall quite naturally from
his lips.

"A woman, on the other hand, never addresses her husband
except in terms of the greatest humility. She speaks
to him as my master, my lord, and even sometimes my god.
In her awe of him she does not venture to call him by his
name; and should she forget herself in this way in a moment
of anger, she would be thought a very low class of person, and
would lay herself open to personal chastisement from her offended
spouse. She must be just as particular in speaking
of him to anyone else; indeed, the Hindus are very careful
never to put a woman under the necessity of mentioning her
husband by name. If by chance a European, who is unacquainted
with this point of etiquette, obliges her to do so,
he will see her blush and hide her face behind her sari and
turn away without answering, smiling at the same time with
contemptuous pity at such ignorance.

"But if women enjoy very little consideration in private
life, they are in some degree compensated by the respect which
is paid to them in public. They do not, it is true, receive
those insipid compliments which we have agreed to consider
polite; but then, on the other hand, they are safe from the
risk of insult. A Hindu woman can go anywhere alone, even[Pg 87]
in the most crowded places, and she need never fear the
impertinent looks and jokes of idle loungers. This appears
to me to be really remarkable in a country where the moral
depravity of the inhabitants is carried to such lengths. A
house inhabited solely by women is a sanctuary which the
most shameless libertine would not dream of violating. To
touch a respectable woman even with the end of your finger
would be considered highly indecorous, and a man who meets
a female acquaintance in the street does not venture to stop
and speak to her."51

Courtesans in India, as in Greece, if of great beauty and
accomplishments, were accorded many more privileges than
the other women. As these were used in the temples, they
were permitted to learn to read and to sing and to dance,
accomplishments which a respectable woman would have been
ashamed to have acknowledged even if she should have learned
them.

In the early times, during the Vedic period, it would seem
that the girls had some choice in the selection of the husband,
and yet the father must have exercised some control over the
affair. But later the selection of both bride and groom was
fast fixed in the hands of the parents, who arranged everything.
With the young man's family the purity of the caste
of the future wife was the greatest concern, beauty and personal
attraction counting nothing, while the girl's parents
thought more of the fortune of the bridegroom to be and of the
character of his mother, because she was to become the absolute
mistress of the young wife. Intermarriage between
castes was not strictly forbidden, but a woman could not
marry a man of lower caste without losing caste.

"To a Hindu marriage is the most important and most
engrossing event of his life; it is a subject of endless conversation
and of the most prolonged preparations. An unmarried
man is looked upon as having no social status and
as being an almost useless member of society. He is not consulted
on any important subject, and no work of any consequence
may be given to him. A Hindu who becomes a
widower finds himself in almost the same position as a bachelor,
and speedily remarries.

"Though marriage is considered the natural state for the
generality of men, those who from pious motives remain unmarried
are looked up to and treated with the utmost re[Pg 88]spect.
But it is only those persons who have renounced the
world, and have chosen to lead a life of contemplation, who
can take vows of celibacy. In any other case marriage is the
rule, and every one is under obligation of discharging the
great debt to his ancestors, namely, that of begetting a son.

...

"But this privilege men possess of remaining single, and
giving themselves up to a life of contemplation, is not shared
by women. They at all events cannot, under any circumstances,
take vows of celibacy. Subjected on all sides to the
moral ascendancy of man, the very idea that they could possibly
place themselves in a state of independence and out of
men's power is not allowed to cross their minds. The opinion
is firmly established throughout the whole of India, that
women were only created for the propagation of the species,
and to satisfy men's desires. All women therefore are obliged
to marry, and marriages are carefully arranged before they
arrive at a marriageable age."52

There were eight kinds of marriages described in the law,
the Institutes of Manu: "Of which one half are honorable,
and differ from one another only in some minute circumstances;
in the fifth, the bridegroom bestows gifts upon the
bride, her father, and paternal kinsman; the last three are
rather species of unlawful connection, than forms of nuptial
contract; one being voluntary and by mutual consent; the
other forcible when a woman is seized, 'while she weeps and
calls for assistance, after her kinsmen and friends have been
slain in battle'; the last, 'when the damsel is sleeping, or
flushed with strong liquor, or disordered in her intellect."53

The following verses from the Rig Veda, a very ancient
Aryan collection of hymns, belonging to the Hindus, give the
ceremony of marriage in those olden times:

"21. O Visvâvasu! (god of marriage), arise from this
place, for the marriage of this girl is over. We extol Visvâvasu
with hymns and prostrations. Go to some other
maiden who is still in her father's house and has attained the
signs of the age of marriage. She will be your share, know
of her.

"22. O Visvâvasu! arise from this place. We worship
thee, bending in adoration. Go to an unmarried maiden whose[Pg 89]
person is well developed; make her a wife and unite her to
a husband.

"23. Let the paths by which our friends go in quest of a
maiden for marriage be easy and free of thorns. May
Aryaman and Bhaga lead us well. O gods! may the husband
and wife be well united.

"24. O maiden! the graceful sun had fastened thee with
ties (of maidenhood), we release thee now of those ties. We
place thee with thy husband in a place which is the home of
truth and the abode of righteous actions.

"25. We release this maiden from this place (her father's
house), but not from the other place (her husband's house).
We unite her well with the other place. O Indra! may she
be fortunate and the mother of worthy sons.

"26. May Pûshan lead thee by the hand from this place.
May the two Asvins lead thee in a chariot. Go to thy (husband's)
house and be the mistress of the house. Be the
mistress of all, and exercise thine authority over all in that
house.

"27. Let children be born unto thee, and blessings attend
thee here. Perform the duties of thy household with care.
Unite thy person with the person of this thy husband; exercise
thy authority in this thy house until old age.

"40. First Soma accepts thee; then Gandharva accepts
thee; Agni is thy third lord; the son of man is the fourth to
accept thee.

"41. Soma bestowed this maiden to Gandharva, Gandharva
gave her to Agni, Agni has given her to me with
wealth and progeny.

"42. O bridegroom and bride! do ye remain here together;
do not be separated. Enjoy food of various kinds,
remain in your own home, and enjoy happiness in company
of your children and grandchildren.

"43. (The bride and bridegroom say), May Prajapati bestow
on us children; may Aryaman keep us united till old
age. (Address to the bride), O bride! Enter with auspicious
signs the home of thy husband. Do good to our male
servants and our female servants, and to our cattle.

"44. Be thine eyes free from anger; minister to the happiness
of thy husband; do good to our cattle. May thy mind
be cheerful; and may thy beauty be bright. Be the mother
of heroic sons, and be devoted to the gods. Do good to our
male servants and our female servants, and to our cattle.[Pg 90]

"45. O Indra! make this woman fortunate and the mother
of worthy sons. Let ten sons be born of her, so that there
may be eleven men in the family with the husband.

"46. (Address to the bride), May thou have influence
over thy father-in-law, and over thy mother-in-law, and be
as a queen over thy sister-in-law and brother-in-law.

"47. (The bridegroom and bride say), May all the gods
unite our hearts; may Mâtarisvan and Dhâtri and the goddess
of speech unite us together."54

Dubois goes quite fully into the ceremonies and functions
of a Brahmin marriage of his time, from which is taken the
following extract.55

There were four different ways of arranging the preliminaries
of a marriage. In the first the father of the bride refused
the sum of money to which he was entitled from the
young man's parents and he bore all the expenses of the
wedding. In the second way the parents of both parties
agreed to share all the expenses. In the third way the youth's
parents bore all the expenses of the wedding and also paid a
sum of money to the father for his daughter. In the fourth
method the girl's parents handed her over to the young
man's parents to do with her what they would. It is needless
to say that the first way was the most honored and respected
and the last was most mortifying to the girl's parents
and it was used by none but the very poorest.

As soon as the parents of a young man had discovered a
suitable girl, when the auguries were favorable, they provided
themselves with presents and went and formally asked
for her. Then the parents of the girl, at a favorable moment,
gave their consent and accepted the presents. Then the priest
who presided at public and private ceremonies fixed on a
lucky day and great preparations were made. The wedding
garments were prepared, the stores for feasts and for presents
were got together, and all the many other things needed. A
canopy was erected and all the relatives and friends invited.

The marriage ceremony lasted for five days. The first
day was the great day, as it was the day on which the most
important and solemn ceremonies took place. The gods and
the ancestors and other divinities were invited to be present.
Then a number of rites and ceremonies were performed, in
which the bride and bridegroom, the parents, and guests par[Pg 91]took.
Near the close of these ceremonies the husband fastened
round the neck of the young wife the tali, the little gold
ornament which all married women wore round their necks,
and which performed by the husband showed that henceforth
the woman was to be his property. The day was ended with
a specially magnificent feast.

Amongst the ceremonies of the second day was the placing
of an ornament, covered with gold-leaf or gold paper and entwined
with flowers, on the forehead of both husband and wife
to avert the effects of the evil eye, the spell which is cast by
the looks of jealous or ill-disposed people. On the third
day the wife joined in the sacrifice offered by the husband,
the only occasion on which a woman could take an active
part in any of the sacrifices. The only remarkable ceremony
on the fourth day was that the newly married couple rubbed
each other's legs three times with powdered saffron, of which
Dubois did not understand the meaning and fancied its only
object was to kill time, just as Europeans under similar circumstances
would spend their time in drinking. The fifth
day was chiefly occupied in dismissing the gods and the ancestors
and the other divinities that had been invited to the
feast. Then followed the distribution of presents. The
festivity ended with a solemn procession through the streets,
which generally took place at night by torchlight in the midst
of squibs and fireworks of all kinds.

A girl's lot after marriage must have been dreadful in
many cases, as she became a servant to the mother of her
husband, who too often tried in every way to make the young
girl miserable. In her husband's home the young wife occupied
the back of the house with the other women and she
must take the humblest place in this apartment for women.
The little girl was scolded quite a great deal and received no,
or but little, praise. "I have several times seen young
wives shamefully beaten by beastly young husbands who
cherished no natural love for them.... A child of thirteen
was cruelly beaten by her husband in my presence for
telling the simple truth, that she did not like so well to be
in his house as at her home."56 Yet, there are here and there
bright spots in this dark home life.

Polygamy was practiced in ancient India, and even down to
later times, as was true among many other ancient nations,
but as a rule it was confined to kings and wealthy lords. It[Pg 92]
was not looked upon with great favor. A person of inferior
rank was not allowed to have more than one wife, except
in case his wife was barren or had only borne female
children, but before he could contract a second marriage he
had to obtain the consent of the first wife.

"Women in India have ever been remarkable for their
faithfulness and their duteous affection towards their husbands,
and female unfaithfulness is comparatively rare."57
Adultery was looked upon with the greatest detestation in
India. Yet the heinousness of the crime was regulated by the
caste of the offender, for a man of high caste committing
adultery with a woman of low caste was by no means so
severely punished as was a man of low caste with a woman
of high caste. In case the man was a Sudra and the woman
of one of the three higher castes he suffered capital punishment,
but as on no account was a Brahmin to be punished
with death, this offence could not bring it to him.

"Although no law has ever said so, the popular belief
is that a woman can have no salvation unless she be formally
married."58 Perhaps for this belief parents became extremely
anxious when their daughters were over eight or nine years
of age and were unsought in marriage. This was so strong
it frequently happened that poor parents feeling that their
daughters must be married would marry girls of eight or nine
to men of sixty or seventy. In the early times child marriages
were unknown, but later boys among the Brahmins
married at about sixteen years of age and girls generally at
five or seven or, at the utmost, nine years of age. One author
states that among the Brahmins, if any girl remained unmarried
until she was eleven years old the family was suspended
from caste.59

In early times in India, widows married and men belonging
to one caste married widows of other castes. "A droll story
is told of the daughter of a householder of Mâlava who married
eleven husbands successively; and on the death of the
eleventh husband the plucky widow would probably have
welcomed a twelfth, but 'even the stones could not help laughing
at her,' so she took to the life of an ascetic."60 But Manu
laid down that a widow should never even mention the name of[Pg 93]
another man after her husband had died, and that a second
husband was nowhere prescribed for virtuous women. A
widower, whatever his age might be, and to whatever caste
he might belong, could marry again; but a woman of the
Brahminical caste, whether she ever lived with her husband
or not, was not allowed again to enter the married state. Sad
was the state of these widows, for they were cast out of society,
but however despised they might have been, if one
remarried her lot became even worse, for she was shunned absolutely
by every honest and respectable person. "I once
witnessed amongst the Gollavarus, or shepherds, an instance
of even greater severity. A marriage had been arranged, and,
in the presence of the family concerned, certain ceremonies
which were equivalent to betrothal amongst ourselves had
taken place. Before the actual celebration of the marriage,
which was fixed for a considerable time afterwards, the bridegroom
died. The parents of the girl, who was very young and
pretty, thereupon married her to another man. This was in
direct violation of the custom of the caste, which condemns
to perpetual widowhood girls thus betrothed, even when, as
in this case, the future bridegroom dies before marriage has
been consummated. The consequence was that all the persons
who had taken part in the second ceremony were expelled
from caste, and nobody would contract marriage or
have any intercourse whatever with them. A long time afterwards
I met several of them, well advanced in age, who had
been for this reason alone unable to obtain husbands or
wives, as the case might be."61

Suttee is the name given to the act of a woman immolating
herself upon the funeral pile with the body of her deceased
husband. This was not practiced in the early times of India,
yet it was quite old as it was known from the time of Alexander,
and even earlier. It continued down till the nineteenth
century, when a noted Hindu, Raja Ram Mohun Roy, got
up such an agitation against it that Lord William Bentinck,
Governor-General of India, enacted a law in 1829, which prohibited
suttee within British dominion and made all assistance,
aid, or participation in any act of it to be murder and
punishable with death. But it did not fully cease till near
the middle of the century.

"Dr. Carey appears to have been the first who made efforts
to ascertain the extent of this practice in Bengal, and he[Pg 94]
found that the number of widows who perished in this way,
within 30 miles of Calcutta, in 1803, was 438. In 1817 the
number of cases officially reported to the magistrate in Bengal
was 706. In 1818 the number was 839, thus making 1,545 in
two years. The number which took place in Bengal from
1815-1826, or for 12 years, as officially reported to the English
magistrates, was 7,154. This number includes only those
which took place in Bengal. There was no means of ascertaining
the whole number of cases in the country. Mr. W.
Ward estimated them at 3,000 annually."62 The practice
was chiefly among kings, princes, Brahmins, and the wealthy
and this made it all the more horrid, because these were the
men who practiced polygamy, and several of the wives were
burned with the husband's dead body. Instances are recorded
of 5, 10, 15, 25, and even more, who thus sacrificed
themselves. Everything was done to get a woman to sacrifice
herself and if after mature deliberation she decided to do so
there was no turning back for her. For if she did not go on
the funeral pyre of her own free will she would be dragged
to it by force. This is well portrayed in the following:

"In 1794, in a village of the Tanjore district called Pudupettah,
there died a man of some importance belonging to
the Komatty (Vaisya) caste. His wife, aged about thirty
years, announced her intention of accompanying her deceased
husband to the funeral pyre. The news having rapidly
spread abroad, a large concourse of people flocked together
from all quarters to witness the spectacle. When everything
was ready for the ceremony, and the widow had been richly
clothed and adorned, the bearers stepped forward to remove
the body of the deceased, which was placed in a sort of shrine,
ornamented with costly stuffs, garlands of flowers, green foliage,
etc., the corpse being seated in it with crossed legs, covered
with jewels and clothed in the richest attire, and the
mouth filled with betel. Immediately after the funeral car
followed the widow, borne in a richly decorated palanquin.
On the way to the burning-ground she was escorted by an
immense crowd of eager sight-seers, lifting their hands towards
her in token of admiration, and rending the air with
cries of joy. She was looked upon as already translated to
the paradise of Indra, and they seemed to envy her happy
lot.

"While the funeral procession moved slowly along, the[Pg 95]
spectators, especially the women, tried to draw near to her
to congratulate her on her good fortune, at the same time
expecting that, in virtue of the gift of prescience which such
a meritorious attachment must confer upon her, she would be
pleased to predict the happy things that might befall them
here below. With gracious and amiable mien she declared to
one that she would long enjoy the favors of fortune; to
another, that she would be the mother of numerous children
who would prosper in the world; to a third, that she would
live long and happily with a husband who would love and
cherish her; to a fourth, that her family was destined to
attain much honor and dignity; and so forth. She then distributed
among them leaves of betel; and the extraordinary
eagerness with which they were received clearly proved that
great value was attached to them as relics. Beaming with
joy, these women then withdrew, each in the full hope that
the promised blessings of wealth and happiness would be
showered on her and hers.

"During the whole procession, which was a very long one,
the widow preserved a calm demeanor. Her looks were
serene, even smiling; but when she reached the fatal place
where she was to yield up her life in so ghastly a manner,
it was observed that her firmness suddenly gave way.
Plunged, as it were, in gloomy thought, she seemed to pay
no attention whatever to what was passing around her. Her
looks became wildly fixed upon the pile. Her face grew
deadly pale. Her very limbs were in a convulsive tremor.
Her drawn features and haggard face betrayed the fright
that had seized her, while a sudden weakening of her senses
betokened that she was ready to faint away.

"The Brahmins who conducted the ceremony, and also
her near relatives, ran quickly to her, endeavoring to keep
up her courage and to revive her drooping spirits. All was
of no effect. The unfortunate woman, bewildered and distracted,
turned a deaf ear to all their exhortations and preserved
a deep silence.

"She was then made to leave the palanquin, and as she was
scarcely able to walk, her people helped her to drag herself
to a pond near the pyre. She plunged into the water with
all her clothes and ornaments on, and was immediately afterwards
led to the pyre, on which the body of her husband
was already laid. The pyre was surrounded by Brahmins,
each with a lighted torch in one hand and a bowl of ghee in[Pg 96]
the other. Her relatives and friends, several of whom were
armed with muskets, swords, and other weapons, stood closely
round in a double line, and seemed to await impatiently the
end of this shocking tragedy. This armed force, they told
me, was intended not only to intimidate the unhappy victim
in case the terror of her approaching death might induce
her to run away, but also to overawe any persons who might
be moved by a natural feeling of compassion and sympathy,
and so tempted to prevent the accomplishment of the homicidal
sacrifice.

"At length, the purohita Brahmin gave the fatal signal.
The poor widow was instantly divested of all her jewels, and
dragged, more dead than alive, to the pyre. There she was
obliged, according to custom, to walk three times round the
pile, two of her nearest relatives supporting her by the arms.
She accomplished the first round with tottering steps; during
the second her strength wholly forsook her, and she fainted
away in the arms of her conductors, who were obliged to
complete the ceremony by dragging her through the third
round. Then, at last, senseless and unconscious, she was cast
upon the corpse of her husband. At that moment the air resounded
with noisy acclamations. The Brahmins, emptying
the contents of their vessels on the dry wood, applied their
torches, and in the twinkling of an eye the whole pile was
ablaze. Three times was the unfortunate woman called by
her name. But, alas! she made no answer."63


Boys and Girls. "A son is the most coveted of all blessings
that a Hindu craves, for it is by a son's birth in the family
that the father is redeemed."64 This accounted for the difference
in the feeling for a boy and for a girl. So strong was
the desire for a son that sonless mothers were filled with great
care and anxiety lest the child should not be a boy. There is,
perhaps, nothing which will so weaken mankind as the life
of the mothers before the birth of the children, so what a
great influence upon the Hindu race must have been this constant
worry of women who were to become mothers. Well
might the wives worry, for according to Manu, a wife who
had all daughters and no sons could be replaced with another
wife in the eleventh year of marriage.

This was also a burden to a girl born into the family. If
a boy died soon after the birth of a girl, or if a girl was[Pg 97]
born soon after her brother's death, she was considered to be
the cause of such death and was accordingly treated very
cruelly. This also had a bad influence upon the boys, as they
soon learned to know of their superior being and learned to
despise and to mistreat their sisters and later all womankind.
After several sons had come into a family a daughter might
not be undesirable and in some cases really wished for. Such
a daughter was kindly and even affectionately treated.

The following is a striking passage. "Young children will
obey their father, because they fear punishment if they do
not; but they will overwhelm their mother with abuse, and
will insult her grossly, even going so far at times as to strike
her. When they grow older they fail to respect even their
father, and it often happens that he is obliged to give way
to his sons, who have made themselves masters of the house.
Strange to say, nowhere are parents fonder of their children
than they are in India; but this fondness usually degenerates
into weakness. If the children are good, they are extravagantly
praised; if they are naughty, their parents show
the utmost ingenuity in finding excuses for them. The mild
punishments that their naughtiness or disobedience brings
down upon them invariably err on the side of leniency. The
parents do not dare to whip them or scold them sharply, or
even inflict any punishment that they would be likely to feel.
The father and mother content themselves with making feeble
remonstrances about their bad behavior, and if these produce
no effect, they leave them to grow up in their evil ways. The
few sensible parents who show more firmness and severity
with their children are met with a show of temper. Sons do
not hesitate to resist the parental authority and threaten to
escape it by running away and living elsewhere. This
threat rarely fails to produce the desired effect; the parents'
severity melts away and they become passive witnesses of the
disorderly conduct of their sons, who, encouraged by this first
victory, end by becoming absolute masters of the house. One
must, however, do them the justice to say that, after having
thus gained the mastery over their parents, they take great
care of them, as a general rule, and see that they want for
nothing in their old age. But I fancy that in acting thus
they are moved less by filial affection than by considerations of
what the world will say."65


Infanticide. It is not strange that under such beliefs and[Pg 98]
treatment as mentioned above that many female children
should have been destroyed. Fathers were willing to destroy
their girls because of so little value and mothers because of
the saving to the girls the burdens which woman had to endure.
Also the Hindus were very superstitious and a child
born under an unlucky star was not only destined, according
to common belief, to all sorts of troubles and accidents during
his life, but he would also bring bad luck to his parents and
relatives. Parents convinced that their child would bring
bad luck, because of having been born on an unlucky day,
would abandon the child at some place along the road, and
even some would strangle and drown such babies.


Dress. All classes of women in India were very fond of
ornaments. They wore jewels and rings in the ears and nose,
rings on the fingers and toes, chains on the neck, and bracelets
on the arms, wrists, and ankles. It was no uncommon
sight to see a woman decked out in all her jewels, drawing
water, grinding rice, cooking food, and attending to all the
menial domestic occupations. But the greatest ornamenting
was on the occasion of marriages, holidays, and other festive
times.

The women not only profusely ornamented themselves, but
they also took great pains and manifested much pride in
ornamenting their children, both boys and girls. Often the
small children would have but little clothing on but they
would be wearing many ornaments, in some cases when all
the clothing worn by the child would, not exceed in value one
dollar they would be wearing ornaments worth one hundred
dollars. Children were frequently robbed and even murdered
for these ornaments.

The dowry given with the girls at marriage consisted very
greatly of the ornaments. What the girl received from her
husband's people or from her home was clearly set forth in
writing and they were considered her own personal property.
If she became a widow she claimed all such things as her
own.


Amusements. The amusements of the Hindus were for the
most part of the sedentary and inactive kind. Yet dancing
was one of the most prominent forms but they did not dance
themselves but had hired performers, the dancers being
young women supposed to be courtesans, and for the most
part connected with the temples. There were feats of bodily
agility and dexterity, as found with the tumbler and the[Pg 99]
juggler. They were fond of chess, cards, and other games of
chance. Story-telling was a favorite diversion.


Rites. The Hindu performed a great many rites. We are
concerned here only with the domestic ceremonies. The
most important of the Domestic Ceremonies were Marriage,
ceremonies performed during pregnancy of wife, birth of
child, first feeding of child, tonsure, initiation, and return
from school on the completion of education.

In marriage there were many parts to the ceremony, all of
which had to be rigorously observed. During pregnancy
there were rites to secure conception, a rite to cause a male
child to be born, rites to insure protection to the child in the
womb, and sometime between the fourth and eighth month
was the ceremony of the husband affectionately parting the
wife's hair.

On the birth of a child a rite was performed and a secret
name given to the child, known only to the parents. The
child was weaned at eight months, at which time he was given
his first solid food, and an appropriate ceremony went with
it. At one year another rite was performed, at which time
the child's head was shaved, leaving such hair as might
be desired for its arrangement as was the custom of the
family.

The ceremony of initiation, or the giving over of the boy
to his teacher for education, was a very important affair, participated
in by the boy and by his teacher. After he had
finished his education, the student returned home, which was
the occasion for another important ceremony, which was followed
by his marriage and the student was then changed into
a householder. At the time of the initiation, the triple cord
or sacred thread, which was worn by the three upper castes,
was bestowed upon the boy. The age of the boy differed at
this time according to which caste he belonged, the Brahmin
boy being initiated between 8 and 16, the Kshatriya between
11 and 22, and the Vaisya between 12 and 24.


Adoption. "When a Hindu had no sons, because of his
wife's failure to bear them to him or because the sons borne
to him had all died, two things were left to him to do, to
take another wife or to adopt a son. If he adopted a child
it was generally from among his own relatives or if a Brahmin,
at any rate from his own caste. He might adopt a
child or an adult, just as he should choose. Girls were
adopted, but there were very few instances of such. The[Pg 100]
adoption was an event of importance and it was attended with
solemn ceremonies.

"The adopted son renounces wholly and forever all his
claims to the property and succession of his natural father,
and acquires the sole right to the heritage of his father by
adoption. The latter is bound to bring him up, to feed him,
and to treat him as his own son; to have the ceremony of
upanayana, or the triple cord, performed for him, and to
see him married. The adopted son, in his turn, is obliged to
take care of his adoptive father in his old age and in sickness,
just as if he were his natural father, and to preside at
his obsequies. On the death of his adoptive father he enters
into full possession of his inheritance       assets as well as
liabilities. Should there be any property left, he enjoys it;
but if, on the other hand, there are debts, he is bound to pay
them. He is, moreover, by his adoption admitted into the
gothram or family stock of the adopter, and is considered to
have left that in which he was born."66


Inheritance. It appears that the property was divided in
earlier times equally among the sons upon the death of their
father. Yet there was a joint system where all lived together
and the eldest son supplied the place of the father, receiving
all the property and then caring for all the others of the
family. At one time it was the custom for a daughter to get
one-fourth as much as a son, and at another time each son
gave to the daughter one-fourth of his share. As was stated
above, when a son was adopted, he renounced all claim to
what his natural father might leave on his death, while he
became the full heir of his adopted father and upon his
death got all that he might leave.

The right of inheritance and the duty of presiding at a
man's obsequies belonged one with the other. When a man
died without leaving direct descendants, if he was wealthy a
crowd of relatives appeared and great disputes often arose
as to whom belonged the honor of conducting the funeral
rites. But if he was poor, and burdened with debts, then
the survivors took every possible care to disprove near relationship.


Education. In the very early times in India, royal courts
were the seats of learning, and the learned and wise of all
nations were welcomed to them. Learned priests were retained
in these courts not only to perform the religious duties[Pg 101]
but also for the purpose of imparting learning. On great
occasions men of learning from all parts came to these places
and discussions were held on ritualistic matters and likewise
on such subjects as the human mind, the destination of the
soul after death, the future world, and the like. Then later
appeared Brahminic settlements called Parishads, answering
to the Universities of Europe. These were at first, perhaps,
conducted by three Brahmins who knew the Vedas,
but the number was increased up to twenty-one. To these
places men of the Brahmin caste who wished to become
learned could go and receive instruction in the Vedas and
such traditionary law and astronomy and philosophy as was
current. Besides these Parishads, there were private schools,
established by individual teachers, who collected about them
a body of students. Also learned Brahmins in their old age
would sometimes retire to forests and gather students around
them. Later great schools arose, such as noted by Houen
Tsang, a Chinese traveler, who spent several years in India
in the seventh century after Christ. "Our traveler now came
to the great NÂLANDA University, if we may call it by that
name. The monks of this place, to the number of several
thousands, were men of the highest ability, talent, and distinction.
'The countries of India respect them and follow
them. The day is not sufficient for asking and answering profound
questions. From morning till night they engage in
discussion; the old and the young mutually help one another.
Those who cannot discuss questions out of the Tripitaka are
little esteemed, and are obliged to hide themselves for shame.
Learned men from different cities, on this account, who desire
to acquire quickly a renown in discussion, come here in multitudes
to settle their doubts, and then the streams (of their
wisdom) spread far and wide. For this reason some persons
usurp the name (of Nâlanda students) and in going to and
fro receive honor in consequence.'"67

The Brahmins themselves received the highest education
possible. This consisted in the memorizing of their sacred
books and a study of the philosophy and science of their
times. The second and third castes seem to have been accorded
the right to study what the first caste did, yet the
third caste must not have entered much into this but have
received a somewhat meager education. As boys followed the
occupation of their parents, they would receive such ele[Pg 102]mentary
instruction as was needed in the trade or work to
be performed. The fourth caste had no need for learning so
they received none except in the duties which a servant was
expected to perform.

In the olden times, when women were well respected and
permitted to appear in public, girls were taught to read and
to write and were given other education. But later they
received no education further than the training for domestic
duties. Education was not needed by women, as a woman
must at all times depend upon some man for her knowledge
of things. The dancing girls received some education, as it
was considered that their religious duties would be better
performed if they should receive some intellectual training.

The student was expected to be obedient and respectful to
his teacher and to serve him in every way. The discipline
of the school was very mild. Laurie quotes from Manu:
"Good instruction must be given to pupils without unpleasant
sensations, and the teacher who reverences virtue must
use sweet and gentle words. If a scholar is guilty of a
fault, his instructor may punish him with severe words, and
threaten that on the next offence he will give him blows; and,
if the fault is committed in cold weather, the teacher may
dowse him with cold water."68

"To the Hindus we are indebted for our numerical notation,
often wrongly attributed to the Arabs. During the
fifth century after Christ they invented an algebra superior
to that of the Greeks, although they were probably assisted
by the work of the latter. They early learned how to calculate
eclipses and find the location of planets by means of
tables. They seem also to have had some knowledge of medicine.
By 300 A.      D. they possessed a treatise on rhetoric, and
had worked out a logic two centuries before the time of
Aristotle; while in the science of grammar, as early as the
fourth century B.      C., they were so far advanced that the
Western world first learned what philology was when the study
of Sanskrit was opened to Europe a hundred or more years
ago."69[Pg 103]

CHAPTER V

THE CHILD IN CHINA



Women and Marriage. The Chinese have an old maxim
that "a woman is thrice dependent; before marriage, on her
father; after marriage, on her husband; when a widow, on
her son." But this refers, no doubt, principally to support
and subsistence, as the mother was greatly respected and had
much authority for even "the emperor himself performs the
ceremonies of the ko-tow before his own mother, who receives
them seated on a throne."70 This power of the mother was
carried to the daughter-in-law, for after marriage the girl
was no longer a daughter but a daughter-in-law and for a
considerable part of her life she was under the absolute control
of a mother-in-law. Cruel treatment was the rule rather
than the exception and the only way out was through suicide,
and suicide and attempts at suicide on the part of wives were
so frequent as to cause but little comment. Christianity requires
a man to leave his father and mother and cleave to
his wife, but Confucianism requires a man to cleave to his
father and mother and compels the wife to do the same. The
sale of wives and children was not uncommon. "It is perfectly
well known to those acquainted with the facts, that
during several recent years in many districts stricken with
famine, the sale of women and children was conducted as
openly as that of mules and donkeys, the only essential difference
being that the former were not driven to market."71

Modesty was deemed so essential in the female character
that it was considered indecorous in women of birth and
breeding to show even their hands, and the dresses were so
made that the long sleeves usually covered the hands when
touching or moving anything. Yet there was adultery, which
was considered a most heinous offence, but instead of bringing
the offender before a magistrate many cases were dealt
with in private. The offender would be attacked by a band[Pg 105]
of men and sometimes his legs were broken, sometimes his
arms, and again quicklime would be rubbed into his eyes,
destroying the sight.

The laws of China did not sanction polygamy but they did
permit concubinage. The man could have but one wife, who
was distinguished by a proper title, while the concubines
were inferior and their children belonged to the wife. If
the wife had borne sons, it was considered somewhat discreditable
for a man to take a concubine, and if he did and
brought her into the same home with his wife there was
usually great disturbance, which accorded with one of their
proverbs, That nine women out of ten are jealous. These
concubines were generally purchased with money and were
from the lower classes, where poverty always prevailed, making
occasion for the selling of the girls. In a few cases, concubinage
in a family might have arisen through the wife's
desire to have women and children to serve her, as they
would come under her control.

There were seven grounds for divorce in China, being,
barrenness, adultery, disobedience to the husband's parents,
talkativeness, thievery, ill temper, and malignant disease. But
divorce was not for the wife, for no offense, of whatever kind,
on the part of the husband, gave a woman any right to
claim a divorce from him. "Any of these, however, may be
set aside by three circumstances: the wife having mourned
for her husband's parents; the family having acquired wealth
since the marriage; and the wife being without parents to
receive her back."72 The family of the woman was a great
factor against divorce, not only on account of the unjustness
or disgrace attached to it but also because when the
woman married she gave up her home and no provision was
made for her further support and especially so if her parents
were dead as the property was divided among her brothers
and she would be looked upon as an alien. Hence a husband
would not be allowed to divorce his wife, except for a most
valid cause.

It was considered disreputable for widows to remarry. But
this was not true of a widower as he could marry whomever
he should choose, nor did he have to wait for any length of
time for the ceremony because of any period of mourning for
his first wife. If the widow herself should be unwilling to
marry, the law would protect her against those trying to[Pg 106]
make her do so. One of the strong motives against marrying
again was that as long as she remained a widow she would be
absolute mistress of herself and her children. The widow
was occasionally sold as a concubine by her father-in-law, but
this was rare, as it was considered a great degradation and
especially as she would be separated from her children.

"A reverse view of matrimonial experiences is suggested by
the practice of wives refusing to survive their husbands and,
like the victims of suttee in India, putting a voluntary end
to their existence rather than live to mourn their loss. Such
devotion is regarded by the people with great approbation,
and the deed of suicide is generally performed in public with
great punctiliousness. The following account of one such
suicide at Fuhchow is taken from the Hong Kong Daily Press
of January 20, 1861:

"'A few days since,' says the writer, 'I met a Chinese
procession passing through the foreign settlement, escorting
a young person in scarlet and gold in a richly decorated chair;
the object of which I found, was to invite the public to come
and see her hang herself, a step she had resolved to take in
consequence of the death of her husband, by which she had
been left a childless widow. Both being orphans, this event
had severed her dearest earthly ties, and she hoped by this
sacrifice to secure herself eternal happiness, and a meeting
with her husband in the next world. Availing myself of the
general invitation, I repaired on the day appointed to the
indicated spot. We had scarcely arrived, when the same
procession was seen advancing from the Joss house of the
woman's native village towards a scaffold or gallows erected
in an adjacent field, and surrounded by hundreds of natives
of both sexes; the female portion, attired in gayest holiday
costume, was very numerous. A friend and I obtained a
bench for a consideration, which, being placed within a few
yards of the scaffold, gave us a good view of the performance.
The procession having reached the foot of the scaffold,
the lady was assisted to ascend by her male attendant, and,
after having welcomed the crowd, partook with some female
relatives of a repast prepared for her on a table on the scaffold,
which she appeared to appreciate extremely. A child
in arms was then placed upon the table, whom she caressed
and adorned with a necklace which she herself had worn.
She then took an ornamental basket containing rice, herbs,
and flowers, and, whilst scattering them amongst the crowd,[Pg 107]
delivered a short address, thanking them for their attendance,
and upholding the motives which urged her to the step she
was about to take. This done, a salute of bombards announced
the arrival of the time for the performance of the
last act of her existence, when a delay was occasioned by the
discovery of the absence of a reluctant brother, pending
whose arrival let me describe the means of extermination.
The gallows was formed by an upright timber on each side
of the scaffold supporting a stout bamboo, from the center of
which was suspended a loop of cord with a small wooden ring
embracing both parts of it, which was covered by a red silk
handkerchief, the whole being surrounded by an awning.

"'The missing brother having been induced to appear, the
widow now proceeded to mount on a chair placed under the
noose, and, to ascertain its fitness for her reception, deliberately
placed her head in it; then, withdrawing her head,
she waved a final adieu to the admiring spectators, and committed
herself to its embrace for the last time, throwing the
red handkerchief over her head. Her supports were now
about to be withdrawn, when she was reminded by several
voices in the crowd that she had omitted to draw down the
ring which should tighten the cord round her neck; smiling
in acknowledgment of the reminder, she adjusted the ring,
and, motioning away her supports, was left hanging in mid-air       a
suicide. With extraordinary self-possession she now
placed her hands before her, and continued to perform the
manual chin-chin until the convulsions of strangulation separated
them and she was dead. The body was left hanging
about half an hour, and then taken down by her male attendants,
one of whom immediately took possession of the
halter, and was about to sever it for the purpose of appropriating
a portion, when a struggle ensued, of which I took advantage
to attach myself to the chair in which the body was
now being removed to the Joss house, in order to obtain ocular
proofs of her demise. Arrived at the Joss house the body was
placed on a couch, and the handkerchief withdrawn from the
face, disclosed unmistakable proofs of death. This is the
third instance of suicide of this sort within as many weeks.
The authorities are quite unable to prevent it, and a monument
is invariably erected to the memory of the devoted
widow.'"73

The most essential circumstance in a respectable family[Pg 108]
alliance was, that there should be equality of rank on either
side. A Chinese lover who should woo a young lady of good
family would visit the house of her parents, where he was
expected to display his accomplishments, especially in penmanship.
There was romance and poetry in the wooing, as
may be shown by this love song, which has been sung in
Cathay for more than two and a half millenniums:



"How rises the moon in radiant glory!
And thou my lady, most charming and sweetest
Oh, listen kindly to love's story!       
Ah, poor my heart that vainly beatest!



"How rises the moon in cloudless effulgence!
And thou my lady, most winsome and purest
Oh, grant thy lover more indulgence!       
Ah, poor my heart what thou endurest!



"How rises the moon in splendor most brightly!
And thou my lady, loveliest, fairest
Wilt never for my love requite me?       
Ah, poor my heart what pain thou bearest!"74



"At the present day marriage is probably more universal
in China than in any other civilized country in the world.
It is regarded as something indispensable, and few men pass
the age of twenty without taking a wife. Chinese legislators
have at all times encouraged early marriages as having a
pacifying effect upon the people. A man who has given hostages
to fortune in the shape of wife and children has a
greater inducement to follow the paths of steady industry,
and is less likely to throw in his lot with brigands and rebels,
than a man who has but himself to think of, and is without
any immediate ties. Besides this the Chinese believe, in common
with the ancient Greeks, that the shades of the unburied
wander restlessly about without gaining admittance into
Hades; so that non-burial came to be considered by them the
most deplorable calamity that could befall one, and the discharge
of the last service a most holy duty. To die, therefore,
without leaving behind a son to perform the burial rites, and
to offer up the fixed periodical sacrifices at the tomb, is one
of the most direful fates that can overtake a Chinaman, and
he seeks to avoid it by an early marriage."75

The two young people to a betrothal in China had very
little to do with it. This was arranged by means of a go-between,[Pg 109]
or match-maker. The negotiations generally originated
with the family of the boy or young man. A card was
made out containing data of the candidate, such as the ancestral
name, the hour, day, month, and year of birth of the
young candidate. At some time in the proceedings both
parties had to make known to each other if there were any
bodily or constitutional defect, what the true age of each
was, whether born of a wife or a concubine, and whether real
offspring or only adopted. Provided with the card, the go-between
went to the other family and stated the object of
the visit. The parents or guardians of the girl would then
make inquiries about the other family, they would consult
a fortune-teller to ascertain if it would be fitting and auspicious
for the two young people to wed. If the offer was acceptable,
then the go-between was furnished with a similar
card about the girl to take to the other family. If within
three days of the engagement an unlucky thing occurred, as
the breaking of a china bowl or the losing of some article in
the house, circumstances were considered to be sufficiently
unlucky to warrant the instant termination of the negotiations.
The betrothal was not binding till certain cards were
interchanged between the families. The outside of the cards
was covered with red paper, on which was pasted a paper
dragon for the one and on the other a paper phœnix. Each
card was adorned with two pieces of red silk. The card with
the dragon was filled out with particulars relating to the family
of the boy and retained by the girl's family, while the one
with the phœnix had particulars of the girl's family and it
was kept by the family of the boy. At the time of the exchange
of cards presents were sent. For the girl was sent a
pair of silver or gold wristlets and for her family articles of
food, as pigs' feet, fruits, fowls, etc. For the boys' family
were sent artificial flowers, bread, cakes, etc.

As usually in a family there was strict separation between
the males and females, there was but little opportunity for
the bride and groom to meet one another and often they
would not have seen one another till the day of the wedding.
The difficulty was increased after betrothal, for it was considered
quite improper for the girl to be actually seen by the
family of the future mother-in-law. The girl had to maintain
the strictest seclusion. She must retire to the inner apartments
when friends called upon her parents, and when going
out she was to use a closed sedan chair. For this reason, most[Pg 110]
engagements were arranged between parties not living in the
same place.

The time which might transpire between betrothal and marriage
varied from a month or two to eighteen or twenty
years, depending much on the age of the parties. "There
are six ceremonies which constitute a regular marriage. 1.
The father and elder brother of the young man send a go-between
to the father and brother of the girl, to enquire her
name and the moment of her birth, that the horoscope of the
two may be examined, in order to ascertain whether the proposed
alliance will be a happy one. 2. If so, the boy's
friends send the go-between back to make an offer of marriage.
3. If that be accepted, the second party is again requested
to put their assent in writing. 4. Presents are then
sent to the girl's parents according to the means of the parties.
5. The go-between requests them to choose a lucky day
for the wedding; and, 6, the preliminaries are concluded by
the bridegroom going or sending a party of his friends with
music to bring his bride to his own house."76

In the spring was considered the most appropriate time
for marriage, and the month in which the peach-tree blossomed
as the happiest time. The following poem translated
from the "Book of Odes," illustrates this:



"Sweet child of spring, the garden's queen,
Yon peach-tree charms the roving sight;
Its fragrant leaves how richly green,
Its blossoms how divinely bright!



"So softly shines the beauteous bride,
By love and conscious virtue led,
O'er her new mansion to preside,
And placid joys around her spread."77



Some time previous to the day fixed, the bridegroom was
invested ceremoniously with a dress cap or bonnet, and he
took an additional name. About this same time the bride,
whose hair had hung down in long tresses, had it done up in
the style of married women of her class in society. Usually,
the day before the wedding, the bride tried on the clothes she
was to wear in the sedan going to the home of her husband,
and what she was to wear the first day upon her arrival at
his home. This was an occasion of great interest to her fam[Pg 111]ily,
and the parents invited female relatives and friends to a
feast that they might view the clothing and help to have
things well prepared for the wedding-day.

On the wedding-day, the bridegroom or his best man and
friends went with an ornamented sedan, accompanied with
musicians, to the home of the bride. When evening came and
the stars were just beginning to peep out, the bride, with a
thick veil over her head and completely covering her features
from view, entered the sedan and the procession, with music
and lanterns, took its way to the home of the bridegroom. On
reaching his residence, the bride was carried into the house
in the arms of matrons and lifted over a pan of burning charcoal
on the threshold. The bridegroom and bride seated
themselves side by side, each trying to sit on a part of the
dress of the other, as it was considered that the one who succeeded
in so doing would rule the household. Then the bride
returned to her chamber and her outer garments and veil
were removed and she was dressed in her wedding finery and
then with her husband she entered upon the wedding-dinner.
Often this was the first time in the husband's life to behold
the features of his wife. He could eat what he chose of the
good things but she, according to established custom, must
not take a particle, but must sit in silence, dignified and
composed. The door of the room was left open and about it
gathered the invited guests, the parents of the bridegroom
and his relatives, all of whom scrutinized the bride and observed
her deportment and expressed their opinions and
criticisms. The cup of alliance was drunk together by the
young couple and pledges were exchanged. On the next day
they worshipped together the ancestral gods of the husband
and paid their respects to his parents and relatives. This
was the wife's last time to be in public with her husband, as
husbands were never seen with their wives in public. On
the third day after the wedding, the bride paid a customary
visit to her own parents.

Whatever else might have been included in the marriage
customs in China, the wedding-feast was the main feature
of the occasion. This might occur upon the wedding-day or
at some later time. Wedding and funeral feasts would be
quite impossible were it not for the "share" system which
they have worked out. Each guest, or each family, were not
only expected but really required by a rigid code of social
etiquette to contribute to the expense of the occasion. This[Pg 112]
was sometimes in food but usually in money and there was a
scale according to which every one knew what his "share"
should be.

"One of the most characteristic methods in which the
Chinese lack of sympathy is manifested is in the treatment
which brides receive on their wedding-day. They are often
very young, are always timid, and are naturally terror-stricken
at being suddenly thrust among strangers. Customs
vary widely, but there seems to be a general indifference to
the feelings of the poor child thus exposed to the public
gaze. In some places it is allowable for any one who chooses
to turn back the curtains of the chair and stare at her. In
other regions, the unmarried girls find it a source of keen
enjoyment to post themselves at a convenient position as the
bride passes, to throw upon her handfuls of hay-seed or chaff,
which will obstinately adhere to her carefully oiled hair for
a long time. Upon her emerging from the chair at the house
of her new parents, she is subjected to the same kind of criticism
as a newly bought horse, with what feelings on her part
it is not difficult to imagine."78


Infancy. "A Chinese baby is a round-faced little helpless
human animal, whose eyes look like two black marbles over
which the skin had been stretched, and a slit made on the
bias. His nose is a little kopje in the center of his face,
above a yawning chasm which requires constant filling to
insure the preservation of law and order. On his shaved
head are left small tufts of hair in various localities, which
give him the appearance of the plain about Peking, on which
the traveler sees, here and there, a small clump of trees around
a country village, a home, or a cemetery; the remainder of the
country being bare. These tufts are usually on the 'soft
spot,' in the back of his neck, over his ears or in a braid or a
ring on the side of his head."79

It was considered a deep disgrace if the children of a Chinese
mother were not all born at the father's home, and in
their efforts to have such occur women would do everything
possible, even going to great inconvenience and hardship. If
this should be the first baby and a boy, there would be great
rejoicing in the whole household, but if a girl there would not
only be no rejoicing but along with depression the young
wife would be treated with coldness and often with harshness,[Pg 113]
and she might be beaten for her lack of discretion in not
producing a son.

On the third day after birth, the child was washed for the
first time. Friends and relatives were invited to take part
and they brought presents to the child. Immediately after
the washing, the ceremony of binding the wrists took place,
which in some cases consisted of the tying of one or more
ancient cash to each wrist by means of a red cotton cord
while with others only a loose red string was put around each
wrist. When the child was a month old, the mother and
child left her room for the first time and the ceremony of
naming the baby and shaving its head took place. All the
relatives and friends were invited and they were expected to
take dinner with the child, and, which was more important,
to take presents.

"The presumption is that a Chinese child is born with the
same general disposition as children in other countries. This
may perhaps be the case; but either from the treatment it
receives from parents or nurses, or because of the disposition
it inherits, its nature soon becomes changed, and it develops
certain characteristics peculiar to the Chinese child. It becomes
t'ao ch'i. That almost means mischievous; it almost
means troublesome       a little tartar       but it means, exactly
t'ao ch'i. In this respect almost every Chinese child is a
little tyrant. Father, mother, uncles, aunts, and grandparents
are all made to do his bidding. In case any of them
seems to be recalcitrant, the little dear lies down on his baby
back on the dusty ground and kicks and screams until the
refractory parent or nurse has repented and succumbed,
when he gets up and good-naturedly goes on with his play
and allows them to go about their business. The child is
t'ao ch'i."80

The baby in China has its toys to play with and it also
has its Mother Goose rhymes and Headland states that he
collected more than six hundred of such rhymes.81 A few will
be sufficient to give here to show their resemblance to our
own. The following is as popular in China as "Jack and
Jill" is here:



"He climbed up the candle-stick,
The little mousey brown,
To steal and eat tallow,
And he couldn't get down.[Pg 114]


He called for his grandma,
But his grandma was in town,
So he doubled up into a wheel,
And rolled himself down."



This next one easily calls up "Lady bug, lady bug, fly away home:"


"Fire-fly, fire-fly,
Come from the hill,
Your father and mother
Are waiting here still.
They've brought you some sugar,
Some candy and meat,
Come quick or I'll give it
To baby to eat."


The following is said over the baby's toes very much as
"This little pig went to market:"


"This little cow eats grass,
This little cow eats hay,
This little cow drinks water,
This little cow runs away,
This little cow does nothing,
Except lie down all day.
We'll whip her."


The Chinese loved their children and yet infanticide existed
with them, but mostly only that of girls. The greatest cause
was poverty. Being too poor to care for their children parents
thought best to kill them than to sell them into slavery. This
perhaps was not large over the whole country and existed
to a great extent only in certain parts, sometimes as high as
eighty per cent. of all girl babies born. The following conditions
as given as found some time before the year 1840, shows
its prevalence in certain districts at that time, as this refers
to a small village on the Amoy island. "On a second visit,
while addressing them, one man held up a child, and publicly
acknowledged that he had killed five of the helpless beings,
having preserved but two. I thought he was jesting, but as
no surprise or dissent was expressed by his neighbors, and
as there was an air of simplicity and regret in the individual,
there was no reason to doubt its truth. After repeating his
confession, he added with affecting simplicity, 'It was before
I heard you speak on this subject, I did not know it was
wrong; I would not do so now.' Wishing to obtain the testimony
of the assembled villages, I put the question publicly,[Pg 115]
'What number of female infants in this village are destroyed
at birth?' The reply was, 'More than one-half.' As there
was no discussion among them, which is not the case when
they differ in opinion, and as we were fully convinced from
our own observations of the numerical inequality of the sexes,
the proportion of deaths they gave did not strike us as extravagant."82

It is difficult to judge this matter correctly when such contrary
opinions are placed before us as in the following quotations,
the first by an American who spent many years in
China and the second by a Chinaman who spent many years
in America. "Much has already been done by those who have
had most opportunity to learn the facts, toward exhibiting
the real practice of the Chinese in the matter of destroying
female infants. Yet no more can be safely predicted than
that this is a crime which to some extent everywhere prevails,
and in some places to such a degree as seriously to affect the
proportion of the sexes. It seems to be most common in the
maritime provinces of the southern part of China, in some
districts of which it is by the Chinese themselves regarded as
a terrible and a threatening evil."83 "I am indignant that
there should be a popular belief in America that Chinese girls
at birth are generally put to death by their parents because
they are not wanted. Nothing can be further from the truth.
In a country like China, where women do not appear in public
life, it must follow that sons are more to be desired, for the
very good reason that family honor and glory depend on
them and ancestral worship necessitates either the birth or
adoption of sons to perpetuate it. I venture to say that in
proportion to population and distribution of wealth that
infanticide is as rare in China as it is in this country."84


Boys and Girls. The relative estimation that was placed
upon boys and girls in olden China is well expressed by a
passage from one of their oldest classics, The Book of Odes.
In describing the palace of an ancient king, the dreams of the
king are treated and then comes the following:


"Sons shall be born to him; they will be put to sleep on couches;
They will be clothed in robes; they will have scepters to play with;
Their cry will be loud.
They will be (hereafter) resplendent with red knee-covers,[Pg 116]
The (future) king, the princes of the land.
Daughters will be born to him. They will be put to sleep on the ground;
They will be clothed with wrappers; they will have tiles to play with.
It will be theirs neither to do wrong nor to do good.
Only about the spirits and the food will they have to think,
And to cause no sorrow to their parents."85


The baby boy was greatly welcomed upon his arrival into
the family, while the baby girl might not only be unwelcomed
but very greatly undesired. This was mostly because girls
counted for so little as they would marry and then no longer
belong to their family but entirely to the family of their
husband. Boys would not only become the support of their
family but they might have opportunity to acquire learning
and thus add dignity and honor to their family. Too, there
was great need of sons to carry on the ancestral worship and
if not born into the family they must be procured through
adoption or by means of concubines. Without a son a man
would live without honor and would die unhappy. No matter
how good or how beautiful a girl might become, she could
never equal the very poorest and weakest boy.


Child and Parent. While his parents were alive, a son
should continue to obey them, was the doctrine of the classics,
the laws, and the customs of China. But a daughter, after
she was married, was not subject to her own parents but to
her husband's parents. Although instances were rare, parents
had the right to bring their children before magistrates
for aid in controlling and punishing them. With all this, it
would seem that the children were not greatly disciplined nor
did they give prompt obedience to their parents.

Public sentiment, especially in the older times of China,
was strongly against the individual who would not accord to
his parents due respect and obedience. No matter how old,
how educated, or how wealthy he might become this respect
and obedience was still due his parents. Confucius taught:
"That parents when alive should be served according to propriety,
that when dead they should be buried according to
propriety, and that they should be sacrificed to according to
propriety."86

"If a son should murder his parent, either father or
mother, and be convicted of the crime, he would not only be
beheaded, but his body would be mutilated by being cut into[Pg 117]
small pieces; his house would be razed to the ground, and
the earth under it would be dug up for several feet deep; his
neighbors living on the right and the left would be severely
punished; his principal teacher would suffer capital punishment;
the district magistrate of the place would be deprived
of his office and disgraced; the prefect, the governor of the
province, and the viceroy would all be degraded three degrees
in rank. All this is done and suffered to mark the enormity
of the crime of a parricide."87


Deformation of the Feet. The practice of footbinding
among the Chinese females was carried on by all classes of
society, so it was not a mark of rank. It was the fashion and
all classes followed it, for in some places women sitting by
the roadside begging had their feet bound, and in some
places, where women worked in the fields, they would have to
kneel to do their work because they could not stand upon their
mutilated feet. But of course it prevailed most with the
higher and wealthier and more fashionable people.

The practice of the compressing of the feet arose in China,
it is thought, sometime during the ninth century of our era.
It is only conjecture as to how and why this originated. Some
accounts state that it arose from a desire to pattern after the
club feet of a popular empress; another story is that it gradually
came into use because of the admiration of small feet
and the attempt to imitate them; and a third suggestion is
that it developed through the men wishing to keep their wives
from gadding. The Chinese women call their feet "golden
lilies," which is accounted for from the popular idea that a
certain empress was so beautiful that golden lilies sprang out
of the ground wherever she stepped.

The age at which the binding began varied, being from six
to eight years of age, but sometimes the bandages were put on
as soon as the little girl was able to walk. The whole operation
was performed, and the shape maintained by bandages,
which were never permanently removed or covered by stockings.
The bandages were of strong white cotton cloth, about
two yards long and between two and three inches wide. The
end of the strip was laid on the inside of the foot at the instep,
then carried over the toes, leaving the great toe free, then
under the foot and round the heel, and the bandage was so
continued till all used up and then the end was sewed tightly[Pg 118]
down. Each day the bandage was tightened and if the
bones should spring back into place upon the removal of the
bandage, sometimes they would be struck back into place with
a blow from the heavy mallet used in beating clothes. These
bandages would finally cause a bulge in the instep, a deep
indentation in the sole, and the toes would grow down under
and across the sole and come out on the opposite side, the
great toe alone retaining its normal position, the foot becoming
from four to six inches in length and sometimes even
three or less.

The pain and suffering, as might be expected, was very
severe and continued so for about three years. In some families
the child would have to stay of nights in an outhouse or
elsewhere away from the family so as not to disturb them
through the night, while in others the mother or mother-in-law
would have a big stick by the side of her bed, with which
to get up and beat the little girl should she disturb the
household by her wails. Toes would often drop off under
binding and sometimes the entire foot. When grown up the
women could walk alone with their maimed feet for short
distances but usually they needed to be supported by some one
or something. "Don't imagine, however, that Chinese ladies
are unable to move. They can, most of them, walk short distances.
But it is true that the spirit is taken out of them by
this species of suffering, and that they are oppressed by a
sense of physical helplessness and dependence."88


Amusements. "The active sports of Chinese boys are few.
There are hardly any sports, so-called, that develop the
muscles and render a lad graceful and agile. The Chinese
boy at sixteen is as grave and staid as an American grandfather;
and if he happens to be married soon after, he throws
aside most games as being childish. At the best, he has nothing
corresponding to baseball, football, cricket, bicycle-riding,
skating, sliding, or tennis. Nor is he fond of exerting himself.
He would rather sit for hours talking and joking than
waste time in running and jumping. He thinks it work if
his play entails much perspiration. His elders, too, frown
upon boisterous games. They approve quiet, meditative lads
who are given to study."89

"Active, manly plays are not popular in the south, and
instead of engaging in a cricket-match or regatta, going to[Pg 119]
a bowling-alley or fives' court, to exhibit their strength and
skill, they lift beams headed with heavy stones to prove their
brawn, or kick up their heels in a game of shuttlecock. The
outdoor amusements of gentlemen consist in flying kites,
carrying birds on perches, sauntering hand in hand through
the fields, or lazily boating on the water, while pitching coppers,
fighting crickets or quails, kicking a shuttlecock, snapping
sticks, chucking stones or guessing the number of seeds
in an orange, are plays for lads."90

"Children's games are always interesting. Chinese games
are especially so because they are a mine hitherto unexplored.
An eminent archdeacon once wrote: 'The Chinese are not
much given to athletic exercises.' A well-known doctor of
divinity states that, 'their sports do not require much physical
exertion, nor do they often pair off, or choose sides and
compete, in order to see who are the best players,' while a
still more prominent writer tells us that, 'active, manly sports
are not popular in the South.' Let us see whether these opinions
are true."91 And this author goes on to give a large
number of games, enough to bear out his statement in the
preface to his book that, "to the careful observer of these
different phases it becomes apparent that the Chinese child is
well supplied with methods of exercise and amusement, also
that he has much in common with children of other lands."

There were numerous holidays and festivals, giving abundance
of entertainment for the children. The principal time
of leisure and rejoicing was at the new year. On the night
of the last day of the old year everybody would remain up
and at midnight a great time was begun with an incessant
firing of crackers and this was kept up for a number of days.
Another great time was at the Feast of Lanterns, in which
was a procession of men and boys with lanterns of all shapes
and sizes, the procession ending with an immense and terrible
dragon, forty feet or more in length, carried aloft on bamboo
poles.

Kite-flying was a national recreation, indulged in by all
ages and classes. It was not an unusual thing to see an old
gray-haired man enjoying it in company of a young boy.
All kinds of kites were used and of all sizes. The ninth day
of the ninth month, which comes in October, was "Kites'
Day." On that day the men and the boys would go out to[Pg 120]
the hills and have a great time. Rank and size and age made
no difference, as all entered into the zeal of the sport just
the same. The greatest sport consisted in the cutting of one
another's kite strings while the kites were in the air, which
was done by the sawing of one string on another.

There were plenty of little shows and juggling and gymnastic
feats for the children and who might wish to see them.
They had Punch and Judy, trained dogs and monkeys, the
whirling of plates, the tossing of knives, juggling of various
kinds, sword swallowing, and many other tricks and performances.

The Chinese children had plenty of toys, which, as in all
countries, were suited to the wants of that country. The
toys were not greatly complicated in structure. There were
rattles for the baby, dolls for the little girl, and drums and
knives and tops for the boys.

"There are not many games in which boys and girls play
together. If they do play together it is only while they are
children, under ten or twelve. Growing-up girls will have
nothing whatever to do with boys, though Chinese boys and
girls are very sociable, each with friends of their own sex."92

Girls have plenty of games they play among themselves       "Lots
of them," which Headland says was the stereotyped
answer that would come from any Chinaman to almost any
question he might be asked about things Chinese. Several
are given but one quoted here will be sufficient to show that
their games are as full of life as among girls anywhere.
"This small girl after some delay took control of the party
and began arranging them for a game, which she called 'going
to town,' similar to one which the boys called 'pounding rice.'
Two of the girls stood back to back, hooked their arms, and
as one bent forward she raised the other from the ground,
and thus alternating, they sang:


Up you go, down you see,
Here's a turnip for you and me;
Here's a pitcher, we'll go to town;
Oh, what a pity, we've fallen down.


At which point they both sat down back to back, their arms
still locked, and asked and answered the following questions:


What do you see in the heavens bright?
I see the moon and the stars at night.
What do you see in the earth, pray tell?[Pg 121]
I see in the earth a deep, deep well.
What do you see in the well, my dear?
I see a frog and his voice I hear.
What is he saying there on the rock?
Get up, get up, ke'rh kua, ke'rh kua.


They then tried to get up, but, with their arms locked, they
found it impossible to do so, and rolled over and got up with
great hilarity."93

In the one city of Peking alone, Headland collected more
than seventy-five different games. In his pictures and descriptions
of games played by boys are such as would call out
much vigorous exercise. One of their favorite games was
"Skin the snake." In this game the boys all stood in line
one behind the other. They would then bend forward and
each put one hand between his legs and grasp a hand of
the boy behind him. Then they all would back and the rear
boy would lie down and the others would back over astride
of him and each would lie down in turn, thus bringing the
head between the legs of his neighbor. When all were down
then the last boy that lay down would get up and each would
get up in turn, raising each one after him, until all were up
and standing straight, when they would let go hands and the
game was finished.

Gambling was, perhaps, the greatest sport of the Chinese,
and it was indulged in by both men and boys. "A boy with
two cash prefers to risk their loss on the throw of a die, to
simply buying a cake without trying the chance of getting it
for nothing."94 One of their means of gambling was through
cricket-fighting. In the season, the crickets were hunted by
men and boys, who would go out to the hills and waysides
to get them. They were cared for and trained and some
would become such great fighters as to command high prices.


Dress. The Chinese did not use wool in clothing. In
the earlier times, before cotton was introduced, it is thought
that they used for their garments some other vegetable fibers,
such as rushes. When cotton was introduced into China, it
became the chief material for clothing. They did not use
underclothing but padded the outer garments for winter use
and as the weather grew colder they would put on more
wadded clothes till in full winter they would become about[Pg 122]
double their usual size. Their shoes were made of cloth and
so they were a poor protection from cold and moisture.

The young women enjoyed wearing colors, pink and green
and blue being the ones most preferred. The ordinary dress
was a large-sleeved robe of silk or cotton over a longer garment,
under which were loose trousers fastened round the
ankles just above the small feet and tight shoes. They wore
their hair hanging down in long tresses, and the putting up
of the hair was one of the ceremonies preparatory to marriage.
The eyebrows were blackened with charred sticks and
arched or narrowed to a fine curved line, to resemble a young
willow leaflet or the moon when a day or two old. Cosmetics
were used quite freely, on grand occasions the face being
daubed with white paint and the lips and cheeks with red,
so that all blushes were covered up. They wore bangles,
bracelets, and ear-rings of glass, stone, and metal. "A belle
is described as having cheeks like the almond flower, lips like
a peach's bloom, waist as the willow leaf, eyes bright as dancing
ripples in the sun, and footsteps like the lotus flower."95

In some parts of China, if not in all, the baby in summertime
wore no clothing at all. In the winter it wore quilted
trousers with feet attached. In some parts the trousers of
the baby were partly filled with sand or earth, so that it was
a common saying that a person who displayed small practical
knowledge had not yet been taken out of his "earth-trousers."
The older children wore the same pattern of clothing and cut
out of the same kind of cloth as their parents and grandparents.


Religion. "In considering all systems of idolatry and
superstition, one significant fact stands prominent, the utter
neglect of religious training of the young. China's three
great religions have nothing answering to the Christian Sunday
School. Of course, boys and girls pick up some religious
ideas in their intercourse with those about them. But nobody
ever deliberately sits down to tell them of this god and
that god, their origin, character and power. Only incidentally
is such knowledge conveyed. There are many religious
books; but from the difficulty of learning to read, they are
necessarily sealed to the young mind. If the young are
told to worship this idol and that idol, they never understand
why and wherefore they should do this. In time they comprehend
that they do it to obtain favor and to gain merit.[Pg 123]

"I well remember the first time I was led to a temple and
there told to bend my knees to the idol decked out in a
gorgeous robe, its face blackened by the smoke from the
incense. On either side of the room stood four huge idols,
with stern and forbidding faces. One of them was especially
frightful. It was the God of Thunder represented by an
image having the body of a man and the head of a highly
caricatured rooster. This idol had a hammer in one hand
and a large nail in the other, with which he is supposed to
strike wicked persons. This god made such an impression
on me that I had a horrible dream about it that very night.
I saw him clad in fierceness; he moved his hands threateningly.
Almost choked with fright though I was, I managed
to cry out and that awoke me."96


Education. Education in China is of long standing. The
Chinese from the earliest time, 2,000 B.      C., or even earlier,
held school education of high value. The competitive literary
examinations of candidates for office was established
about a thousand years later and about 700 A.      D. the whole
plan was gone over and arranged as found in the last century,
previous to the changes of recent years. No other
nation has so venerated scholars and scholarship.

Nevertheless of this high esteem for education, there were
no public schools in the sense as with us as the government
did not establish schools, except, perhaps, for the most advanced
students. Yet there were a great number of schools,
taken care of in a private way, and although every village
did not have a school, yet they would have liked such, but
mostly on account of poverty could not, for everywhere was
the most profound reverence for education. There were
three classes of undergraduate schools: "The primary, in
which little is attended to beyond memoriter recitation and
imitative chirography; the middle, in which the canonical
books are expounded; and the classical, in which composition
is the leading exercise."97 Because of the great number of
literary scholars who wanted to teach, the pay for the most
part was quite meager.

School usually began about six in the morning, and it continued
all day, with intervals for breakfast and lunch, sometimes
running till dark. In some of the higher schools the
scholars would return in the evening to their school work.[Pg 124]
School would continue throughout the entire week and the
year, except one month during the New Year's festival and
a vacation at wheat harvest and also at the autumnal harvest.
If the teacher was preparing himself for a literary degree,
there might be a vacation of about six weeks in the summer.
The teacher was often not quite regular in his attendance at
the school and the pupils were still more irregular than he,
so that in a way made up for the lack of holidays.

There were scarcely any school-houses as such in China.
The schools were held as a rule in the hall of a temple or in
a private building, usually the ancestral temples were used
for such purposes, and yet they might be held in a shed,
which scarcely protected from the weather, or in the upper
attic of a shop. In this room were placed a table, with an
arm-chair, for the teacher. The writing-materials, which
consisted of brushes, India ink, and ink-wells made of slate,
were placed on this table. About the room were tables and
stools for the pupils. In one corner of the room was placed
a tablet or an inscription on the wall, dedicated to Confucius
and the god of Letters.

Whatever may be said of education in older China, the
teachers were educated men, the majority of them being unsuccessful
candidates for literary degrees, but many of them
were Bachelors and not a few were Doctors. For the work
they had to do they were well prepared by a long course of
study and they were usually competent. "In no country is
the office of teacher more revered. Not only is the living
instructor saluted with forms of the profoundest respect, but
the very name of teacher, taken in the abstract, is an object
of almost idolatrous homage."98 Yet, "as a matter of fact,
the Chinese teacher is often barely able to keep soul and
body together, and is frequently obliged to borrow garments
in which to appear before his patrons."99

The first day of school was a great and noted day in the
life of a Chinese boy. He entered school in his seventh or
eighth year. When he was to enter school, a lucky day was
found for him, and with his good clothes on he started for
school, feeling that this was the greatest event that was to
happen in his life till he entered the Imperial Academy,
which he was sure to do, so said all his friends. On entering
the school-room he saluted, by prostrating himself, the[Pg 125]
picture of Confucius and next, with almost as much reverence,
saluted his teacher, for the teacher was held in very
high respect.

The course of study for the schools of China was formulated
a long time ago and rigidly held to in all the schools
of the empire. It was divided into three grades of instruction.
The Chinese language does not have an alphabet but
there is a different symbol for each word. In the first period
the pupil was to learn the most important symbols, learning
also to write them, and to commit to memory the nine sacred
books, known as the Four Books and the Five Classics. The
Four Books are known as the Confucian Analects, the Great
Learning, the Golden Medium, and the Sayings of Mencius;
and the Five Classics are the Book of Changes, the Book of
History, the Spring and Autumn Annals, the Book of Odes,
and the Book of Rites. All this would take four or five years
on the part of the pupil. As these books were written in the
old Chinese language they would not be understood by the
pupils and the second stage of learning consisted in the translation
of these books and classics into the language of the
pupils, and also there were lessons in composition. The
commentaries on these works were taken up and their meaning
explained. In the third stage of learning composition
was entered upon and consisted in the writing of essays and
poems, imitating the style and thought of the five classics
and the better commentaries. A full comprehension of the
four books and the five classics and the commentaries upon
them and the use of this knowledge in the writing of essays
and poems was the desired end aimed at by the Chinese
scholar and which was all that was needed for the highest examination
in the empire.

The methods of teaching with the Chinese were formal,
being based upon methods handed down from the ages, so
that all teachers taught in the one stereotyped way. In
teaching reading the teacher would have the pupils come to
his desk, stand in line, each holding his book open before him.
The teacher would read aloud a line, the pupils would then
read this in concert in a loud voice, and this would continue
till the pupils could pronounce the line without the teacher's
help. Then they would go to their seats and commit this
line to memory, each shouting it out as loud as he could.
"Every Chinese regards this shouting as an indispensable
part of the child's education. If he is not shouting how can[Pg 126]
the teacher be sure that he is studying? and as studying and
shouting are the same thing, when he is shouting there is
nothing more to be desired."100 When the pupil had learned
the line, he would go to the teacher's desk, lay his book upon
it, turn his back to the teacher, and shout out the line as
rapidly as he possibly could do. This method gave to the
Chinese the phrase "to back the book" as we have "to learn
by heart." This method was continued till the whole book
was committed to memory.

The only other subject taught in the elementary schools
was writing. In teaching writing, the master would make
a copy and the pupil would place it under transparent paper
and trace it with a hair pencil and then copy it without the
tracing till he could make it from memory. "In lieu of slates,
they generally use boards painted white to save paper, washing
out the writing when finished."101 In China, writing
takes the place that drawing and painting do here, so all
strive to become fine penmen.

For most of the boys, three or four years was the extent
of their schooling, but if higher education was desired they
attended higher schools. Here they were given lectures explaining
the meaning of classical authors, which lectures were
greatly committed to memory. They were also taught prose
and verse composition, in which they followed the thought,
style, and meter of the sacred books or of great writers, memorizing
these writings for the purpose.

The Chinese teacher was very severe. The more severe he
was, the better teacher he was considered. Fear ruled in the
Chinese school. That the boy might ever be reminded of
the necessity of studying, the implements to help him were
always kept in plain view, as, "a wooden ruler to be applied
to the head of the offender and sometimes the hands, also a
rattan stick for the body. Flogging with this stick is the
heaviest punishment allowed; for slight offenses the ruler is
used upon the palms, and for reciting poorly       upon the
head."102 Teachers carried their punishments to extreme
lengths. The bad pupils were the stupid ones who did not
get their lessons assigned in the given time. For such, severe
beatings were administered, so severe that in one case "a pupil[Pg 127]
was so much injured as to be thrown into fits, and such instances
can scarcely be uncommon."103

Girls were not often educated in China, because the parents
thought it of no use as they would marry and leave them,
also there was no such incentive for girls as with boys, who
might hold office, and besides popular opinion regarded reading
and writing dangerous arts in female hands. Nevertheless
here and there a woman came forth among the educated
and celebrated instances were sometimes quoted of women
who have been skilled in verse. When a woman did emerge
with a good education, she was highly respected for her attainments.
The girls of the better class were taught needlework,
painting on silk, and music.

Education in China did not stop with the youth, as the
manner of filling the offices through literary competitive examinations
kept many studying even to old age. This
system was very old, dating back to several centuries before
Christ. In these examinations there were three grades of
degrees conferred       "flowering talent," Bachelors; "promoted
man," Master; "entered scholar," Doctor. Beyond
this was yet another higher honor, as the very highest became
members of the Imperial Academy, the "forest of pencils,"
at the court at Peking. The best and most finished scholar
of all was so designated every three years by the Emperor,
the very greatest honor. The only thing in history that seems
to approach this honor is the winning of the foot-race at the
Olympian Games.

Chinese education appears to fulfill the saying heard in
this country in bygone days       Educate a boy and he won't
work       for in China "the scholar, even the village scholar,
not only does not plow and reap, but he does not in any way
assist those who perform these necessary acts. He does not
harness an animal, nor feed him, nor drive a cart, nor light
a fire, nor bring water       in short, so far as physical exertion
goes, he does as nearly as possible nothing all day. 'The
scholar is not a utensil', (a Confucian saying), he seems
to be thinking all day long, and every day of his life, until
one wishes that at times he would be a utensil, that he might
sometimes be of use. He will not even move a bench nor
make any motion that looks like labor."104[Pg 128]

"There are among us who are enamored of state-systems
which regulate education down to its minutest detail, and
leave no room for the free play of mind: in China we have
this indirectly accomplished and see in it all its necessary
rigidity, uniformity, and pedantry. There are who advocate
a secular system of education: in China we see this in full
operation. There are who think that all success in the
education of mind should be measured by external competitive
tests: in China we have this elaborated into an iron
system. There are who cling by the dogmatic and preceptive,
and regard with suspicion the habituating of the mind of
schoolboys to ideals esthetic and spiritual, including even
the simple elements of humanity: in China they will find
what they desire to see. There are who hold that teachers
and school-inspectors are heaven-born, and are above the
study of educational principles and methods (as the Emperor
Sigismund was supra Grammaticam): so China thinks."105

Whatever may be said of Chinese education, it has lasted
through the ages and it has sufficed for the needs of the nation.
It may be that when this old nation gets a system of education
based upon European and American ideas, and fills her
offices with the most highly educated and only the most highly
educated, then may China lead the world.

CHAPTER VI

THE CHILD IN JAPAN



Women. Although women have always stood higher in
Japan than in any other oriental country, yet they were much
more highly considered in the early times than in the later
times. There was no seclusion, they had a station in society,
they shared in the recreations of their fathers and husbands,
they possessed intellectual and physical vigor, they filled offices
of state and religion; in fact, they ranked alongside of
men as among the best nations of the earth. Among the
rulers of Japan there have been nine empresses, the most
noted having been Jingu and who led a conquering expedition
into Corea about 200 A.      D., from whence came letters,
religion, and civilization into Japan.

"Of one hundred and twenty-three Japanese sovereigns,
nine have been women. The custodian of the divine regalia
is a virgin priestess. The chief deity in their mythology is
a woman. Japanese women, by their wit and genius, made
their native tongue a literary language. In literature, art,
poetry, song, the names of women are among the most brilliant
of those on the long roll of fame and honor on whose
brows the Japanese, at least, have placed the fadeless chaplet
of renown. Their memory is still kept green by recitation,
quotation, reading, and inscription on screen, roll, memorial-stone,
wall, fan, cup, and those exquisite works of art that
delight even alien admirers east and west of the Pacific.

"In the records of the Japanese glory, valor, fortitude in
affliction, greatness in the hour of death, filial devotion, wifely
affection, in all the straits of life when codes of honor, morals,
and religion are tested, in the person of their professors, the
literature of history and romance, the every-day routine of
fact, teem with instances of the Japanese woman's power and
willingness to share whatever of pain or sorrow is appointed
to man. In the annals of persecution, in the red roll of
martyrs, no names are brighter, no faces gleam more peace[Pg 131]fully
amidst the flames, or on the cross of transfixing spears,
or on the pyre of rice-straw, or on the precipice edge, or in
the open grave about to be filled up, than the faces of the
Christian Japanese women in the seventeenth century. Such
is the position of woman in Japan in the past."106

In later times woman fell from her high estate and even
lost power over herself, as she came under her father in the
home, under her husband when married, and under her son
when widowed. "The introduction of the Chinese civilization
with the Confucian system of moral philosophy, and of
Buddism, and later on the establishment of Feudalism, were
prejudicial to this high position of women. Chinese philosophers
seem not to have had much respect for women; while
Buddism regards women as sinful creatures, a temptation and
snare, an obstacle to peace and holiness. In our feudal system,
in the code of Bushido, there was no reverence for
women as in the Western Chivalry."107 Buddism entered
into Japan in the sixth century of the Christian era and
Confucianism came in some earlier, while Feudalism existed
in Japan earlier than in Europe and continued later, from
the fifteenth to the sixteenth centuries being the time during
which the feudal system received its most perfect development
and the Bushido, or "The Way of the Samurai," was
fully elaborated.

The Japanese women had a love for beauty, order and
neatness; they were patient and long-suffering; their hopes
lay in their children and they tended and cared for them as,
perhaps, no other nation of women ever did. They had plenty
to keep them busy with their numerous household duties and
the making of their own clothing and that of their children.
Many of them were engaged in the care of silk-worms and
in tea-picking. The country wife was busy in the rice-field,
doing her work alongside her husband and sons, as well as
performing the other duties that came into her country life.
"Among the daily tasks of the housewife, one, and by no
means the least of her duties, is to receive, duly acknowledge,
and return in suitable manner, the presents received in the
family. Presents are not confined to special seasons, although
upon certain occasions etiquette is rigid in its requirements
in this matter, but they may be given and re[Pg 132]ceived
at all times, for the Japanese are pre-eminently a
present-giving nation."108

"As regards our standard of beauty.... A woman to
be considered beautiful by us, need not be tall. Height may
be divinely imposing, but not essential to human beauty.
With us, about five feet would be considered the most desirable
height, but if one must err, it is advisable to err by
exceeding rather than by falling short of the mark. The
figure should be slender without being bony, the waist long
and the hips narrow. To secure grace, the body should be
held slightly forward, not boldly erect. A very important
feature is the neck, which should be long, white, slender,
and gracefully curved. The hair should, of course, be abundant,
long, and perfectly straight, and while no deviation
from black is tolerated, it should not be just black, but should
be so glossy that it seems blue-black. The face should be
oval and long, with a straight nose, which should also be high
and narrow. As for the eyes, opinions are divided, one
school of connoisseurs demanding that they should be large
with a double line of the lid, while another school prefers
that the eyes should be long and narrow and slightly slanting
upwards at the outer corner. The color of the eye should
always be clear and deep brown; the lashes thick, long, and
curved; the eyebrows black and distinct, their line long, and
well arched; the mouth small; lips thin, curved, and red;
teeth small, regular, and white. The ears must be evenly
curved, with no angle, and in size not too small, for pinched
lobes look poverty-stricken. Large ears, like those of the
probable inhabitants of Mars, lately described by Professor
Perrier, if not exactly beautiful, are believed to be lucky.
As for the shape of the forehead, there are four types. By
the one termed 'horned,' we mean that in which the hair
grows to a point in the middle of the forehead and high at
the sides after the fashion called by the Germans Geheimraths-Ecke
or the 'Councillor's corners.' Then there are the
square and the round types; but the forehead most admired
is high and narrow at the top, and obliquely slanting at the
sides, suggesting the outline of our sacred mountain, Fuji.
As for the complexion, it should be fair, with a tint of the
rose on the cheek, only, in our parlance, we would call it
cherry-hued."109[Pg 133]

One of the phases of the life of women in Japan is that
of the dancing-girls, the geisha. These are girls obtained
when quite young from poor parents or as orphans and
trained in establishments for entertaining at tea-houses or
at private gatherings. They are taught the old Japanese
dances, and other dances, to sing and to play on instruments,
to serve wine, and in other ways to entertain. These are
from ancient times. "The geisha are not necessarily 'bad
women,' as you call them, not any worse professionally than
the actresses and vaudeville artistes of America."110 Whatever
the geisha may be, there is no question about the jōrō,
or courtesans, because licensed houses exist in every part of
Japan. Yet this is claimed of rather recent origin, as in the
older times such houses did not exist, and especially in the
villages and towns of the interior, where there were even but
few of such women. The saddest side of these houses is their
filling through filial obedience, the one thing considered most
important for Japanese women. "The Japanese maiden, as
pure as the purest Christian virgin, will, at the command of
her father, enter the brothel tomorrow, and prostitute herself
for life. Not a murmur escapes her lips as she thus
filially obeys. To a life she loathes, and to disease, premature
old age, and an early grave, she goes joyfully. The
staple of a thousand novels, plays, and pictures in Japan
is written in the life of a girl of gentle manners and tender
heart, who hates her life and would gladly destroy it, but
refrains because her purchase-money has enabled her father
to pay his debts, and she is bound not to injure herself. In
the stews of the great cities of Japan are today, I doubt not,
hundreds of girls who loathe their existence, but must live
on in gilded misery because they are fulfilling all righteousness
as summed up in filial piety."111

Old age was not a burden or a fear among the Japanese
women, nor was it something to be ashamed of. Old age
was really welcome, and especially in the last centuries when
woman's freedom was taken away and obedience to the men
introduced, for old age brought freedom, as then the mother
became a person of much consideration, to be waited upon
and cared for by children and grandchildren, the burdens
of life being turned over to them. "As she bears all things,
endures all things, suffers long, and is kind, as she serves her[Pg 134]
mother-in-law, manages her husband's household, cares for
her babies, the thought that cheers and encourages her in
her busy and not too happy life is the thought of the sunny,
calm old age, when she can lay her burdens and cares on
younger shoulders, and bask in the warmth and sunshine
which this Indian Summer of her life will bring to her."112


Marriage. A young woman in Japan was expected as a
matter of course to marry. Any young woman was not forced
to marry any young man, for there was a certain freedom
of choice on her part. Young people were expected to marry
within their rank. In the early times, marriage between a
brother and sister of the same mother was not permitted,
but if by the same father by a different mother they could
marry, as they were not considered related as in the first
instance. In these earlier times marriage was permitted at
sixteen in man and thirteen in woman. Marriage was not
a religious affair, and not even a contract between the parties.
It was rather a giving away of the girl to the man
who was to be her husband and to his family, so that the
bride's person and property passed completely under the
control of the husband and his family.

At one time, according to one authority, when a youth
had fixed his affections upon a maiden of suitable condition,
he disclosed his passion by attaching a branch of a certain
shrub (the Celastrus alatus) to the house of the damsel's
parents. If this emblem of his passion was neglected, it
implied that his suit was rejected; if accepted, so was the
lover; and should the young lady wish to express reciprocal
tenderness, she forthwith blackened her teeth, though she
must not pluck out her eyebrows until after the wedding.113
In other times, the affair was arranged by a go-between. A
young man would get a married friend to help him select
a bride, to make his wants known to the girl and her family,
and to arrange a meeting between the young people at the
home of a mutual friend, where they could decide the matter.
Again the matter may have been arranged by the families,
it might be a long time in advance, so that the young
people did not have much to do with it.

When the matter was decided on, then presents were exchanged,
the young man usually sending a piece of handsome[Pg 135]
silk, used for the obi or girdle, which corresponded to the
engagement-ring of Europe and America, but sometimes the
young man sent other presents, and because of which a handsome
daughter was considered rather an addition to the fortune
of a family. A formal betrothal was then entered into,
and a lucky day found for the wedding.

Just before the wedding, generally on the morning of the
wedding-day, the bride's trousseau and the household goods,
which the bride was expected to take with her, were sent to
the house of the bridegroom. These varied according with
the rank and position and wealth of the bride's family. The
trousseau would contain dresses for all seasons and sashes of
all kinds, and since fashion unchanged a woman might enter
her husband's home with a supply of clothing that could last
her through a lifetime.

As in old times the wedding ceremony occurred in the
afternoon, toward noon there was a bridal procession from
the bride's home to the home of the bridegroom. The bride
was seated in a palanquin, clothed and veiled in white, escorted
by two bridesmaids, and accompanied by relatives,
neighbors, and friends, the men all in their dress of ceremony
and the women in their gayest robes. When the procession
reached the bridegroom's home, the bride was escorted
by the bridesmaids into the room of state, where sat
the bridegroom in the post of honor, surrounded by parents
and nearest relatives.

When the real ceremony was performed there were present
the bridegroom and his parents, the bride and her parents,
a few of the most intimate relatives or friends, and the cupbearers,
perhaps not over a dozen people in all. There was
no religious ceremony, no words were spoken, no promises,
no vows, no prayer. When all was ready, the wedding-cup,
a two-spouted cup, was filled by a young girl with native
wine (saké) and presented to the mouths of the bride and
groom alternately, till all was drank by them, being a symbol
as husband and wife of the equal sharing of their joys and
sorrows of married life. Then the young couple arose and
offered cups of sak         to their parents, after which the bride
removed her veil, and the ceremony was ended. Then the
wedding-guests, who had been in other rooms during the
ceremony, joined the wedding-party and all partook of a
feast prepared for the occasion, with the mirth and joy that[Pg 136]
usually accompany weddings among all peoples and in all
times.

On the third day after the wedding, the newly-married
couple were expected to make a visit to the bride's family.
The bride's family prepared a dinner for the occasion, with
music and dancing by professional performers, and other
entertainment. A large number of the relatives and friends
were invited and the bride appeared as hostess with her
mother. Within the course of two or three months, the newly
married couple were expected to entertain either in their
own home, the home of the bridegroom's parents, or at a
tea-house.

"There are wedded couples who labor and save heroically
for years, in order to pay the expenses of their marriage
festival. There is one rather amusing custom, however,
whereby this expense may be avoided. A couple of respectable
people have a daughter, who is acquainted with a good
young fellow who would be an excellent husband for her,
except that he lacks the necessary means to give her the
customary wedding-presents and keep a free table for a week,
for the two families. The parents, coming home from the
bath one fine evening, do not find their daughter at home.
They inquire in the neighborhood; nobody has seen her,
but all the neighbors offer their services in assisting to find
her. The parents accept the offer, and the procession, constantly
increasing in numbers, passes from street to street,
until it reaches the dwelling of the lover. The latter, protected
by his closed screens, in vain pretends to be deaf;
he is at last obliged to yield to the demands of the crowd.
He opens the door, and the lost daughter, in tears, throws
herself at the feet of her parents, who threaten her with
their malediction.

"Then, the tender-hearted neighbors, moved by the scene,
intercede; the mother relents; the father, remains haughty
and inexorable; the intercession of the neighbors increases in
eloquence, and the young man promises to be the most faithful
of sons-in-law. Finally, the resistance of the father is
overcome; he pardons his daughter, pardons the lover, and
calls the latter his son. All at once, as if by magic, cups
of saké circulate among the crowd; everyone takes his or
her place on the matting of the room; the two outlaws are
seated in the midst of the circle, drink their bowl of saké
together, the marriage is proclaimed in the presence of a[Pg 137]
sufficient number of witnesses, and the police officer enters
it upon his list the next morning."114

There is another side of Japanese marriage, where the
young man enters the home of the bride. If in a family
there was no son to inherit the name and no son was adopted,
upon the eldest daughter's coming of age, her family would
seek some young man who would be willing to marry the
daughter and give up his own name and take that of the
family. The young men were usually attracted to such a
marriage because thereby they could inherit wealth or rank
or both, but sometimes such was entered upon solely on account
of the attractiveness of the young lady.

It is a question whether polygamy in itself ever existed
in Japan, but there is no question about concubinage, as
it began at an early time, for the Emperor was allowed
twelve supplementary wives and the nobles (samurai) two.
It seems from the earliest there was one legal wife, and
whatever the other women were they were subservient to her.
But concubinage did not prevail very much among the middle
and lower classes, and with the upper classes only with
the wealthier members. These concubines were kept in the
home unless the legal wife was strong enough to keep them
out, when they were furnished separate dwellings. They were
ever a discordant element in the life of the family. Since
both Shintoism and Confucianism called for ancestral worship,
where there were no offspring by the legal wife, this
might call for concubinage to raise up children, and sometimes
where there was no heir, the wife might for that cause
urge the husband to take a handmaid to raise up sons to
preserve the ancestral line. If the child of a concubine was
adopted into the family, it was taken from the mother and
she became no more to it than any other of the servants and
had no more to do with it than they did.

During feudalism in Japan, the legal status of women was
very low. They had no legal rights and their evidence was
not admitted in a court of justice. The husband had unlimited
power of divorce, but under no circumstances could
a wife demand to be separated from her husband, but she had
to abide his will. A great reason for a wife suffering much
and not leaving her husband was that the children belonged
to him and in case of a separation their disposal rested absolutely
with him.[Pg 138]

"Seven causes for justifiable divorce are laid down in the
classics of Confucius, which are the basis of legal morals in
Japan as in China, or as those of Justinian are with us.
The wife may be divorced:

1. If she be disobedient to her parents-in-law. (After
marriage, in her husband's home, his parents become hers
in a far more significant sense than among us.)

2. If she be barren. (If the husband loves his childless
wife, he keeps and supports her.)

3. If she be lewd or licentious. (She must not be given
to loose talk or wine. It is not proper for her even to write
a letter to any other man.)

4. If she be jealous (of other women's clothes, or children,
or especially of her husband).

5. If she have a loathsome or contagious disease. (If
dearly beloved, she may be kept in a separate room and
cared for.)

6. If she steal.

7. If she talk too much.

"It is needless to say that the seventh and last reason is
the one frequently availed of, or pretended. The Japanese
think it is a good rule that works but one way. The husband
is not divorced from the wife for these equal reasons. Of
course, woman in Japan, by her tact, tongue, graces, and
charms, is able to rule her husband generally by means invisible
to the outer world, but none the less potent. Though
man holds the sword, the pen, and divorce, and glories in
his power, yet woman, by her finer strength, in hut as in
palace hall, rules her lord."115


The Mother's Memorial. "A sight not often met with in
the cities, but in the suburbs and country places frequent as
the cause of it requires, is the nagaré kanjō (flowing invocation).
A piece of cotton cloth is suspended by its four
corners to stakes set in the ground near a brook, rivulet, or,
if in the city, at the side of the water-course which fronts
the houses of the better classes. Behind it rises a higher,
lath-like board, notched several times near the top, and inscribed
with a brief legend. Resting on the cloth at the
brookside, or, if in the city, in a pail of water, is a wooden
dipper. Perhaps upon the four corners, in the upright
bamboo, may be set bouquets of flowers. A careless stranger
may not notice the odd thing, but a little study of its parts[Pg 139]
reveals the symbolism of death. The tall lath tablet is the
same as that set behind graves and tombs. The ominous
Sanskrit letters betoken death. Even the flowers in their
bloom call to mind the tributes of affectionate remembrance
which loving survivors set in the sockets of the monuments
in the grave-yards. On the cloth is written a name such as is
given to persons after death, and the prayer, 'Namu miō, hō
ren ge kiō' (Glory to the salvation-bringing Scriptures).
Waiting long enough, perchance but a few minutes, there
may be seen a passer-by who pauses, and, devoutly offering
a prayer with the aid of his rosary, reverently dips a ladleful
of water, pours it upon the cloth, and waits patiently until
it has strained through, before moving on.

"All this, when the significance is understood, is very
touching. It is the story of vicarious suffering, of sorrow
from the brink of joy, of one dying that another may live.
It tells of mother-love and mother-woe. It is a mute appeal
to every passer-by, by the love of Heaven, to shorten the
penalties of a soul in pain.

"The Japanese (Buddhists) believe that all calamity is the
result of sin either in this or a previous state of existence.
The mother who dies in childbed suffers, by such a death, for
some awful transgression, it may be in a cycle of existence
long since passed. For it she must leave her new-born infant,
in the full raptures of mother-joy, and sink into the darkness
of Hades, to wallow in a lake of blood. There must she
groan and suffer until the 'flowing invocation' ceases, by
the wearing-out of the symbolic cloth. When this is so utterly
worn that the water no longer drains, but falls through at
once, the freed spirit of the mother, purged of her sin, rises
to resurrection among the exalted beings of a higher cycle
of existence. Devout men, as they pass by, reverently pour a
ladleful of water. Women, especially those who have felt
mother-pains, and who rejoice in life and loving offspring,
repeat the expiatory act with deeper feeling; but the depths
of sympathy are fathomed only by those who, being mothers,
are yet bereaved. Yet, as in the presence of nature's awful
glories the reverent gazer is shocked by the noisy importunity
of the beggar, so before this sad and touching memorial
the proofs of sordid priestcraft chill the warm sympathy
which the sight even from the heart of an alien, might
evoke.

"The cotton cloth inscribed with the prayer and the name[Pg 140]
of the deceased, to be efficacious, can be purchased only at
the temples. I have been told, and it is no secret, that rich
people are able to secure a napkin which, when stretched
but a few days, will rupture, and let the water pass through
at once. The poor man can get only the stoutest and most
closely woven fabric. The limit of purgatorial penance is
thus fixed by warp and woof, and warp and woof are gauged
by money. The rich man's napkin is scraped thin in the
middle. Nevertheless, the poor mother secures a richer tribute
of sympathy from her humble people; for in Japan, as
in other lands, poverty has many children, while wealth
mourns for heirs; and in the lowly walks of life are more
pitiful women who have felt the woe and the joy of motherhood
than in the mansions of the rich."116


Dress. The ordinary dress of both sexes in Japan in the
older times was quite similar but differed in color and texture.
It consisted of a number of loose, wide gowns worn
over each other, fastened at the waist with a girdle. The
family arms were woven or worked into the back and breast
of the outer garment. The sleeves of the garments were wide
and long. Within doors the feet were bare or covered with
socks and outdoors clogs of straw, matting, or wood were
worn, kept on the feet by an upright pin or button held
between the two large toes.

The men shaved the front and crown of the head, leaving
a sort of tuft on top; the boy's head was shaved in different
ways, but at fifteen the boy's hair was dressed exactly like
a mature man, because then he attained his majority. Among
the women the hair was worn long but arranged differently
for a married woman than a young girl, and, too, the married
women removed the hair of the eyebrows.

The infant was free from swathing; at three its clothes
was bound at the waist with a girdle. At seven or later the
boy of noble birth wore a short sword in his girdle which at
fifteen, when he became a man, he would exchange for the
two swords of the samurai.


Regulations. During the two hundred and fifty years       sixteenth-nineteenth
centuries       when Japan was cut off from
all outside people, the strictest economy was necessary for
the nation to be able to care for itself. To this end regulations
were laid down to which the different classes had to
adhere closely. These were binding and must have proved[Pg 141]
irksome, yet they preserved the nation. It seems well to
give some of the regulations here.

"The following are examples, first, of the rules applying to
the bungen (station in life) of a farmer of seventy-five to
one hundred koku ($375 to $500), and, second, to that of a
common farm-laborer:

I. For a Farmer of 100 Koku.

1. Such a farmer may build a house whose length is ten
ken (about sixty feet), but there must be no parlor (zashiki),
and the roof must not be tiled. If the householder wishes
to tile the roof, to protect it against fires, he must first get
permission.

2. On the occasion of a marriage of a son or daughter, the
gifts of the householder must be limited to the following:


Two nagamochi (a chest used for bed-clothes).
One tansu (a chest of drawers).
One tsuzura (a vine used in basket making).
One hasami-bako (a case for scissors).
A yuinō obi (a present, usually the sash called obi, exchanged
at the time of the wedding).
One sensu (a fan).
One taru (a vessel containing wine).
Surume (a kind of fish).
Kobu (a kind of seaweed).
Tai (a kind of fish, used on occasions of ceremony).


3. The viands on the wedding-day must be as follows:

(1) Zōni-zuimono (a kind of soup).

(2) The things placed on the honzen (a small table):
(a) in the hira (one of the dishes), namasu (a kind of fish);
(b) in the choku (the other dish), something roasted or
broiled.

(3) Hikimono (viands taken home by each guest): (a)
suimono (soup), two kinds; (b) torimono (a liquid), two
kinds; (c) hikigashi (a kind of cake). These three kinds altogether
must not make more than a small amount.

4. The family must never wear silk clothes. If a son or
a daughter is to marry a person whose station allows the use
of silk, the householder must request him not to use it on
the occasion of the wedding.

5. No guests should be invited other than relations of the
family, ko-bun (people who are under obligations to the
householder for kindness received, and stand in the place of[Pg 142]
children), and a few of the most intimate friends. But this
rule refers only to the day of the wedding.

6. At a wedding or New Year's call, the use of jū
(lacquer boxes, containing confectionery, given as presents)
is forbidden.

7. When a member of the family makes a visit to a relation
or elsewhere, he should not carry valuable presents.
When he is visiting a sick friend, he may take anything
which happens to be at hand.

8. When there is death (fukō), and people come to the
house on visits of condolence, no wine should be offered.

9. At a funeral (butsuji) wine should not be offered to
the persons who follow to the grave.

10. On such occasions, the viands should be of five kinds
only; but there should be no wine. If wine is offered, it
should be given in soup-cups, not in wine-cups, nor should
tori-zakana (a dish served only with wine) be prepared.

11. On the occasion of the birth of a first child (Uizan),
the presents from the grandparents should be as follows
only:


A cotton garment.
One set (four boxes) of jū.
One taru.
Viands.


From the other relations only small money-presents, if
any should be sent.

2. When the child is taken to the mura (village) temple
(the occasion called miya-mairi), jū may be offered to the
grandparents, but not to others.

13. At the time of hatsu-bina (girls' festival), and hatsu-nobori
(boys' festival), grandparents and other relations
should not present hina and nobori (dolls and flags), the
whole family should present a single kami-nobori (paper-flag)
and two yari (spears), and relatives may also make
small money-presents.

II. For the Bungen of a Farm-laborer.

1. The house may be five and a half ken (about thirty-two
feet) in length, and the roof should be of straw or bamboo
thatch.

2. The presents at a wedding may be:


One tsu zura (a vine used in basket making).
Nagamochi (chests) are forbidden.[Pg 143]


3. At entertainments, one hira (dish) and one soup may
be offered, but not in cups.

4. The collar and sleeve ends of the clothes may be ornamented
with silk, and an obi (belt) of silk or silk crêpe may
be worn, but not in public.

5. Hair ornaments should consist of norihiki and motoi,
and nothing more.

6. Footwear should be narazōri (sandals made at Nara)
not setta (sandals of iron and leather). Women are to wear
bamboo-thonged sandals ordinarily, but at occasions of ceremony
sandals with cotton thongs; men should wear only
bamboo-thonged sandals on all occasions.

7. At the time of Uizan (birth of first child) the grandparents
may send two jū (set of confectionery boxes), and
money for rice and fish; other relations should send only
money for fish.

8. At the time of hatsu-nobori, the grandparents may
present a yari (spear), and at the time of hatsu-bina a kami-bina
(paper doll), or tsuchi-ningyo (earthen doll).

"Accompanying these specific regulations, made with careful
reference to each man's station in life, there were also
general rules to meet unspecified contingencies. For example,
only in case of absolute necessity could an umbrella
be used by the ordinary laborer. He must usually content
himself with the protection of a straw raincoat. Another
provision related to costly articles which a family might
happen to have. Special permission was necessary to make
use of them, and no articles of luxury were to be used if on
hand."117


The Care of Children. The birth of a child among the
Japanese was a cause of rejoicing, a boy being somewhat
more welcome than a girl. At the birth of a child, a special
messenger was sent to notify relatives and intimate friends,
who must soon visit the baby and take it presents, and especially
so if it was the first in the family. Yet infanticide
was not uncommon, for poverty sometimes decided against
the infant, and this also might be true of a child born
maimed or deformed. "In old days, when the new-born
child was laid at the father's feet, the father could refuse
to take it, and the child was then exposed to die in a bamboo-grove.
The custom exists no longer; I doubt whether it ever
prevailed to any very great extent, but it has left behind it a[Pg 144]
very picturesque reminder. If parents have lost a child by
death, they often, not perhaps unnaturally, look upon their
loss as the visitation of an angry Heaven, which must need
be propitiated by the free-will offering up of the next born
child. So when the next child is born it is taken to the
bamboo-grove and left by its parents. The exposure is, however,
nothing very serious; a friend of the family is waiting
round the corner for the weeping parents to abandon their
infant, and a few minutes afterwards he comes in, quite as
if it were by accident, and tells the bereaved couple that he
has just picked up a fine, handsome baby boy (or girl), which
he hopes they will take and rear. Thus the anger of Heaven
has been, figuratively at least, averted, and the baby is known
in after life by the word sute ('abandoned') prefixed to his
personal name. He is known as sutejiro or sutesaburo, as
the case may be ('the abandoned second son' or 'the abandoned
third')."118

The baby's dress was loose and easily put on, so it was
soon dressed. The dresses were made like the kimono of the
mother, being wide-sleeved and straight, silk, cotton, or flannel,
as the season demanded, and long enough to cover the
feet and hands. Red and yellow were the colors of the young
baby's dress, and if a girl high colors prevailed later, but a
boy's clothing became subdued in color. Near the one hundredth
day of the child's life, long dresses were left off
and also about the same time it was weaned. The baby's
head was kept shaved bald until it was three years of age,
when only a part of it was shaved; it might all be shaved
but a tuft on top, or tufts at the side, or bare on top and
encircling the head at the sides, just as the mother might
wish. "There is no limit set to the whimsical mother's taste
in this matter of tonsorial landscape gardening."119

Since the Japanese sat on the floor with their legs under
them, the baby was placed on the floor with its knees bent
under it, which trained it to the right way of sitting. The
baby in learning to walk did not have chairs and the like
to bump against and fall over and it had soft-matted floors
to bump down upon without injury. It was quite noteworthy
if the baby of his own accord should walk before its
first birthday, and mochi (rice pastry) was made to celebrate
the auspicious event. When the baby went outdoors,[Pg 145]
then its feet were hampered by sandals or clogs fastened to
the feet by straps passing between the toes, but he soon
learned to use them all right, so that babies of two or three
could get around all right in these clogs. One good thing,
these clogs did not bind the children's feet, but let them
grow naturally. These clogs left the toes of the Japanese
children free and thus they retained some of their prehensive
powers so that in adult life the feet were still used
somewhat for holding and grasping. It would seem that the
baby learned to talk some earlier than in other countries, as
the Japanese language is conducive for such since it abounds
in expressions easy for children.


Naming Children. On the seventh day, some authors say
the thirteenth, the child received its name, at which time
very little ceremony took place; at seven years of age this
name gave way to another name; which occurred again upon
reaching his majority at fifteen. When he married he received
another name; again he was given a new name if he
took office; another new name came if promoted; and, finally,
after death, he received his last name, which was engraved
upon his tomb.


Carrying Children. The babies were carried upon the back
of some member of the family, quite often an older brother
or sister and sometimes these were not over five or six years
of age. The baby was tied upon the back of the one carrying
it, face front, head and feet out, and even in quite cold
weather. The babies soon learned to hold on and thus they
looked out for themselves so as not to be dropped by the
one carrying them. "The mother bears the bairns, but the
children carry them. Each preceding child, as it grows older,
must lug the succeeding baby on its back till able to stand.
The rearing of a Japanese poor family is a perpetual game
of leap-frog."120


Adoption and Inheritance. There was a great desire, especially
in feudal times, to have a male heir to keep up the
ancestral line, which otherwise would be a disgrace to the
family. There being no male heir, it might be that a son
would be adopted in early life to grow up as the heir, or
he might be adopted with the idea of his marrying one of
the daughters later, or there might be no formal adoption
but a young man would marry a daughter and give up his
own name and take that of the family and thus become the[Pg 146]
heir. The childless wife, if not divorced, would often care
for the adopted child as if her own, which care would be
reciprocated by the adopted son in her old age. In feudal
times, in case a man should die leaving no children, either
natural or adopted, his death was concealed till the lord gave
permission for him to adopt a son, and not till then was
his death announced, for otherwise the lands escheated to the
lord.


Power and Duty of Father. As in Rome, the family was
the unit in feudal times in Japan, and the head of the family
held complete power. He had the full control of the persons
and property of his children and he could do with them
as he chose, only being held back by that most binding of
all laws       custom. Yet, as he had great power, so had he
great responsibilities, as he was responsible to the state for
the doings of his family.


Amusements. Old Japan was a realm of sports. It was a
nation of players. There seemed not to have been any distinct
line of demarcation between the amusements of the
children and those of the adults. The grown-up people entered
with zest into games which were in many cases the
same and in many others similar to the games of the young
people. There were numerous holidays and festivals, on
which days the whole nation of people seemed to give themselves
over to the toy-sellers and showmen and story-tellers
and musicians and games and plays       to a time of general
enjoyment. Perhaps there was never any other people or
country in the entire world at any time that took as much
interest in the pleasures of their children as did the old
Japanese.

When the evenings were pleasant they were spent out-of-doors,
and on pleasant moonlight evenings almost the entire
population of a town would be on its streets. At other
times the evenings would be spent in the home, the entire
family being together, including the grandparents and even
the servants. Sometimes the father would tell stories of
Japanese history and of folk-lore, sometimes they would play
chess and checkers, but the greatest time was spent with
cards. One such game was known as "The poems of a hundred
poets." On one card was written the half of one hundred
famous Japanese poems and the other half on another
card, half of these cards being distributed among the players
and the other half being given to a reader. The reader[Pg 147]
would call off the half of one poem and the one having the
other half would call back and this would continue till all
the cards were matched. There was dancing of evenings,
usually by the young women, sometimes by the men, but,
perhaps, never by men and women together. In some places
of moonlight nights the young people would dance all night
in the streets or open places near the castle-gates.

"Among the ghostly games intended to test the courage
of, or perhaps to frighten, children, are two plays called,
respectively, 'Hiyaku Monogatari' and 'Kon-daméshi,' or the
'One Hundred Stories' and 'Soul-examination.' In the
former play a company of boys and girls assemble round the
hibachi, while they, or an adult, an aged person or a servant,
usually relate ghost-stories, or tales calculated to straighten
the hair and make the blood crawl. In a distant dark room,
a lamp (the usual dish of oil), with a wick of one hundred
strands or piths, is set. At the conclusion of each story, the
children in turn must go to the dark room and remove a
strand of the wick. As the lamp burns down low, the room
becomes gloomy and dark, and the last boy, it is said, always
sees a demon, a huge face, or something terrible. In the
'Kon-daméshi,' or 'Soul-examination,' a number of boys,
during the day plant some flags in different parts of a graveyard,
under a lonely tree, or by a haunted hillside. At night,
they meet together, and tell stories about ghosts, goblins,
devils, etc.; and at the conclusion of each tale, when the
imagination is wrought up, the hair begins to rise and the
marrow to curdle, the boys, one at a time, must go out in the
dark and bring back the flags, until all are brought in."121

The children had plenty to see to keep them amused.
There were visits to the theaters, sometimes the performances
lasted all day, in which were displayed the doings of historical
peoples and lore heroes. There were all kinds of gymnastic
feats and juggling of various kinds. "At the fair at
Asakusa, in addition to the performances of jugglers of all
kinds, there are collections of animals which have been taught
to perform tricks       bears of Yezo, spaniels which are valuable
in proportion to their ugliness, educated monkeys and goats.
Birds and fish are also displayed in great quantities. But
the most astonishing patience is manifested by an old Corean
boatman, who has trained a dozen tortoises, large and small,
employing no other means to direct them than his songs and[Pg 148]
a small metal drum. They march in line, execute various
evolutions, and conclude by climbing upon a low table, the
larger ones forming, of their own accord, a bridge for the
smaller, to whom the feat would otherwise be impossible.
When they have all mounted, they dispose themselves in
three or four piles like so many plates."122

Among the leading amusements were the Festivals. These
were of frequent occurrence and of the greatest diversity, so
that the young people had plenty to amuse them. There
were five great annual Festivals, which were the Festival
of the New Year, the Festival of the Dolls, the Festival of
the Banners, the Feast of Lanterns, and the Feast of Chrysanthemums.

The New Year Festival occurred on the first day of the
first month of the old Japanese year. At this time congratulations
and presents were much given and taken. This was
a time for pleasure and all the members of the family laid
aside their work and their dignity and entered into the fun
and the sport that characterized this festival.

The Festival of the Dolls occurred on the third day of
the third month. This day was especially devoted to the
girls, and to them it was the greatest day of the year. All
the dolls belonging to the family were brought out and which
had been accumulating in some families for hundreds of
years. When a daughter was born in a home, two images
of wood or enameled clay were bought for her, with which
she played, and when she was married she took them to her
new home and kept them for her children, as well as any
other dolls she might have. "The Tokugawa collection, of
which I have spoken, is remarkably full and costly, for it
has been making for hundreds of years in one of the younger
branches of a family which for two and a half centuries
was possessed of almost imperial power, and lived in more
than imperial luxury; but there are few households so poor
that they do not from year to year accumulate a little
store of toys wherewith to celebrate the feast, and, whether
the toys are many or few, the feast is the event of the year
in the lives of the little girls of Japan."123

On the fifth day of the fifth month was celebrated the
Festival of the Banners, which was celebrated in honor of
the boys, and it was to them the greatest day in the year.[Pg 149]
On this day all kinds of military toys were displayed, such
as heroes, warriors, generals, soldiers, etc. Also there were
flags, streamers, banners, etc. A set of these toys was bought
for every son born in the family. So as with the display of
dolls, in old Japanese families the display on the Feast of
Banners was very great. About the houses and on poles in
the yards were hung long paper pennons of every color,
banners with coats of arms, and also attached to a pole by a
string was a paper fish, hollow so that as the wind filled it
out it would flop its tail and fins in a most natural way.
This paper fish was to show that a son had been born during
the year or that there were sons in the family.

The Feast of Lanterns occurred on the seventh day of
the seventh month. On this occasion the whole city or town
was decorated with lanterns. In some places little girls
would go in crowds through the streets and sing with all their
might while swinging paper lanterns.

"The fifth festival takes place on the ninth day of the
ninth month, and is called the Feast of Chrysanthemums.
At all the family repasts during the day, the leaves of chrysanthemum
flowers are scattered over the cups of tea and
saké. It is believed that the libations prepared in this
manner have the power of prolonging life. The citizen of
Tokio would consider that he was wanting in his duty as a
good husband and father, if he should partake sparingly of
this specific."124

That children enjoyed themselves and that they were helped
to enjoy themselves was well shown in the abundance of
toys and toy-shops and many holidays on which to display
them. The streets of the towns and cities were full of toy-shops,
where every kind of toys imaginable could be found.
Too, toys, and especially the religious varieties, were displayed
for sale about the temples on feast days. There were
images of the various gods and of implements and appliances
used about the temples. There were on the streets
toys of all kinds of animals, of wrestlers and acrobats, of
soldiers, etc., etc. Dolls were one of the strongest features
of toy-makers and toy-sellers. "Here let me tell you something
you certainly never heard of before in relation to Japanese
dolls,       not the tiny O-Hina-San I was just speaking
about, but the beautiful life-sized dolls representing children
of two or three years old; real toy-babes which, although[Pg 150]
far more cheaply and simply constructed than our finer kinds
of Western dolls, become, under the handling of a Japanese
girl, infinitely more interesting. Such dolls are well dressed,
and look so life-like,       little slanting eyes, shaven pates,
smiles, and all!       that as seen from a short distance the best
eyes might be deceived by them. Therefore, in those stock
photographs of Japanese life, of which so many thousands
are sold in the open ports, the conventional baby on the
mother's back is most successfully represented by a doll.
Even the camera does not betray the substitution. And if
you see such a doll, though held, quite close to you, being
made by a Japanese mother to reach out its hands, to move
its little bare feet, and to turn its head, you would be almost
afraid to venture a heavy wager that it was only a doll.
Even after having closely examined the thing, you would
still, I fancy, feel a little nervous at being left alone with it,
so perfect the delusion of that expert handling.

"Now there is a belief that some dolls do actually become
alive.

"Formerly the belief was less rare than it is now. Certain
dolls were spoken of with reverence worthy of the Kami,
and their owners were envied folk. Such a doll was treated
like a real son or daughter: it was regularly served with
food; it had a bed, and plenty of nice clothes, and a name.
If in the semblance of a girl, it was O-Toku-San; if in that
of a boy, Tokutarō-San. It was thought that the doll would
become angry and cry if neglected, and that any ill-treatment
of it would bring ill-fortune to the house. And, moreover,
it was believed to possess supernatural powers of a
very high order.

"In the family of one Sengoku, a samurai of Matsue,
there was a Tokutarō-San which had a local reputation
scarcely inferior to that of Kishibojin,       she to whom Japanese
wives pray for offspring. And childless couples used
to borrow that doll, and keep it for a time,       ministering
unto it,       and furnish it with new clothes before gratefully
returning it to its owners. And all who did so, I am assured,
became parents, according to their heart's desire.
'Sengoku's doll had a soul.' There is even a legend that
once, when the house caught fire, the Tokutarō-San ran out
safely into the garden of its own accord!

"The idea about such a doll seems to be this: The new
doll is only a doll. But a doll which is preserved for a[Pg 151]
great many years in one family, and is loved and played with
by generations of children, gradually acquires a soul."125

There was an abundance of outdoor sports among the Japanese
children. Beginning with the New Year there came
the great game with the girls of battledore and shuttlecock.
The girls made a beautiful sight, of which, no doubt, they
were aware. With their gayest dresses, hair arranged in a
most pleasing way, faces powdered and lips painted, the
graceful, rhythmic motion of their bodies, their bright eyes
and laughing faces, all combined to make them and their sport
a most attractive scene. Kite-flying was about as great an
amusement in Japan as in China. All kinds and sizes of kites
were used. Some represented birds, others men, and yet
others monsters. Kite-fights were of frequent occurrence.
A part of the kite-string was smeared with glue and then
sprinkled with powdered glass, which prepared it for sawing
another kite-string in two, thus causing it to fall and become
the property of the one sawing the string. To make
the fight the more realistic, at the top of the frame of the
kite was set a piece of whalebone, which in vibrating in the
wind made the most blood-curdling howls. Also contests in
tops were held, in which it was the aim to damage one
another's tops and stop the spinning. There was leaping
and running and jumping and wrestling and slinging. They
played blind-man's-buff, prisoner's base, and pussy wants a
corner, but in these last two instead of the officer and Puss,
the oni, or devil, was the chief performer. They had stilts
and handled them so well as to play games on them and
run races. Where there was snow and ice, the Japanese
children coasted, built snow-forts, fought battles with snow-balls,
and the like. They made snow-men in the likeness
of Daruma, a follower of Buddha, who lost his legs by paralysis
and decay from long meditation and prayer in a squatting
position.

The Japanese children in their plays imitated their elders,
just as children everywhere do. Playing the doctor was one
of the great imitative plays of the younger children, and
there were dinners and tea-parties and weddings and
funerals. One of the great amusements of the Japanese was
wrestling-matches and the children imitated these with much
precision, as they would stamp their feet, eat their salt,
rinse their mouths, slap their knees, and then clinch and tug[Pg 152]
till one or the other was victor. "Another game which was
very popular was called the 'Genji and Heiké.' These are
the names of the celebrated rival clans, or families, Minamoto
and Taira. The boys of a town, district, or school ranged
themselves into two parties, each with flags. Those of the
Heiké were red, those of the Genji white. Sometimes every
boy had a flag, and the object of the contest, which was begun
at the tap of a drum, was to seize the flags of the enemy. The
party securing the greatest number of flags won the victory.
In other cases, the flags were fastened on the back of each
contestant, who was armed with a bamboo for a sword, and
who had fastened, on a pad over his head, a flat, round piece
of earthenware, so that a party of them looked not unlike
the faculty of a college. Often these parties of boys numbered
several hundred, and were marshalled in squadrons,
as in a battle. At the given signal, the battle commenced,
the object being to break the earthen dish on the head of
the enemy. The contest was usually very exciting. Whoever
had his earthen disk demolished had to retire from the
field. The party having the greatest number of broken
disks, representative of cloven skulls, was declared the loser.
This game has been forbidden by the Government as being
too severe and cruel. Boys were often injured in it."126


Lore. The lore of Japan is as rich as that of other countries.
Only a few of the things concerning children can be
given.

"Japanese papas, who find, as other fathers do, how much
it costs to raise a large family, will not let an infant, or even
a young child, look in a mirror (and thus see a child exactly
like itself, making apparent twins); for if he does, the
anxious parent supposes the child, when grown up and
married, will have twins.

"Children are told that if they tell a lie, an oni, or an
imp, called the tengu, will pull out their tongues.

"If a boy rests a gun on top of his head, he will grow
no taller. Children must not carry any kind of basket on
their heads, nor must they ever measure their own height.

"Children are told if they strike anything with their chopsticks
while at their meals, they will be struck dumb.

"When a maimed or deformed child is born, people say
that its parents or ancestors committed some great sin.

"In Japan, as with us, each baby is the most remarkable[Pg 153]
child ever seen, and wondrous are the legends rehearsed concerning
each one; but it is a great day in a Japanese home
when the baby, of his own accord, walks before his first birthday,
and mochi (rice pastry) must be made to celebrate the
auspicious event.

"Young girls do not like to pour tea or hot water into a
cup of kawaméshi (red rice), lest their wedding-night should
be rainy.

"Little boys, tempted to devour too much candy, are
frightened, not with prophecies of pain or threats of nauseous
medicines, but by the fear of a hideous worm that will surely
be produced by indulgence in sweets."127

A peculiar superstition was in connection with the sacred
trees, which were found quite numerous in both city and
country. The patron gods of these trees were thought to
inflict great injury upon those who might desecrate the trees.
Believing this, sometimes a young woman whose affections
had been stirred and then set aside used these sacred trees
as a means of avenging herself. Making a rude image of
straw to represent her former lover, at the "hour of the ox,"
two o'clock in the morning, she carried this straw man to one
of these trees. Having on her feet the high clogs, worn in
Japan, her hair disheveled, dressed in a loose flowing white
night-dress, carrying in her hand nails and hammer, she
proceeded to the tree and crucified on it the straw image of
her lover. Then she beseeched the gods to whom the tree
was dedicated to bring down affliction and even death upon
him who mutilated the tree. These visits were repeated and
the same things gone over till her recreant lover sickened and
died. It is not told whether this always occurred or not.

"The wonderful story of 'Raiko and the Oni' is one of
the most famous in the collection of Japanese grandmothers.
Its power to open the mouths and distend the oblique eyes
of the youngsters long after bedtime, is unlimited. I have
before me a little stitched book of seven leaves, which I bought
among a lot of two dozen or more in one of the colored print
and book shops in Tōkio. It is four inches long and three
wide. On the gaudy cover, which is printed in seven colors,
is a picture of Raiko, the hero, in helmet and armor, grasping
in both hands the faithful sword with which he slays the
ghoul whose frightful face glowers above him. The hiragana
text and wood-cuts within the covers are greatly worn, show[Pg 154]ing
that many thousand copies have been printed from the
original and oft-retouched face of the cherry-wood blocks.
The story, thus illustrated with fourteen engravings, is as
follows:

"A long time ago, when the mikado's power had slipped
away into the hands of his regents, the guard at Kiōto was
neglected. There was a rumor in the city that oni, or demons,
frequented the streets late at night, and carried off people
bodily. The most dreaded place was at the Ra-jō gate, at
the southwestern entrance to the palace. Hither Watanabé,
by order of Raiko, the chief captain of the guard, started
one night, well armed. Wearily waiting for some hours, he
became drowsy, and finally fell asleep. Seizing his opportunity,
the wary demon put out his arm from behind the
gate-post, caught Watanabé by the neck, and began to drag
him up in the air. Watanabé awoke, and in an instant seized
the imp by the wrist, and, drawing his sword, lopped the
oni's arm off, who then leaped onto the cloud, howling with
pain. In the morning Watanabé returned and laid the trophy
at his master's feet. It is said that an oni's limb will not
unite again if kept apart from the stump for a week. Watanabé
put the hairy arm in a strong stone box, wreathed with
twisted rice straw, and watched it day and night, lest the
oni should recover it. One night a feeble knock was heard
at his door, and to his challenge his old aunt's voice replied.
Of course, he let the old woman in. She praised her nephew's
exploit, and begged him to let her see it. Being thus pressed,
as he thought, by his old aunty, he slid the lid aside. 'This
is my arm,' cried the old hag, as she flew westward into the
sky, changing her form into a tusked and hairy demon. Tracing
the oni's course, Raiko and four companions, disguised
as komusō (wandering priests), reached the pathless mountain
Oyé, in Tango, which they climbed. They found a beautiful
young girl washing a bloody garment. From her they
learned the path to the oni's cave, and that the demons eat
the men, and save the pretty damsels alive. Approaching,
they saw a demon cook carving a human body, to make soup
of. Entering the cave, they saw Shu ten dōji, a hideous
tusked monster, with long red hair, sitting on a pile of silken
cushions, with about a hundred retainers around him, at a
feast. Steaming dishes were brought in, full of human limbs,
cooked in every style. The young damsels had to serve the
demons, who quaffed saké out of human skulls. Raiko and[Pg 155]
his band pretended to join in the orgies, and amused the
demons by a dance, after which they presented them with a
bottle of saké which had been mixed with a narcotic. The
chief drank a skullful and gave to his retainers. Soon all
the demons were asleep, and a thunder-storm of snores succeeded.
Then Raiko and his men threw off their disguise,
drew sword, and cut off their heads, till the cave flowed blood
like a river. The neck of the chief demon was wider than
Raiko's sword, but the blade miraculously lengthened, and
Raiko cut the monster's head off at one sweep. They then
destroyed the treasure, released all the prisoners, and returned
to Kiōto in triumph, exposing the huge head along
the streets."128


Religion. Before the introduction of Christianity into Japan,
there were but three religions: Shintoism, Confucianism,
and Buddhism. The first is native to Japan and the other
two are importations. Shintoism teaches nature and ancestor
worship, cleanliness, and purity. As is the nature of the
Japanese, so this native religion has some merrymaking in it.
Confucianism teaches implicit obedience to those who are in
power, as emperor, parent, and teacher. Buddhism is somewhat
similar to Christianity in making its followers kind to
those in lower life, as, the poor, and animals. "In a word,
'Shintoism furnishes the object of worship, Confucianism
offers the rules of life, and Buddhism supplies the way of
future salvation.'"129

There is no doubt that all three of these religions had much
to do in moulding the character of the young in Japan, for
in nearly every house of the reigning class were the books
or emblems or symbols or idols of these three religions.

The school children had a god all to themselves, who was
supposed to aid them in their study. This god was called
"Ten-jin," or "Heavenly Man." As the boy desired to
become a scholar, learned in the Chinese characters and an
excellent penman, so he prayed to Ten-jin to help him in all
these.


Suicide. The Japanese did not fear death nor dread the
consequences of a future world, so that suicide was not looked
upon as in Europe and America today. "As for the young
lovers of whom I speak, they have a strange faith which
effaces mysteries for them. They turn to the darkness with[Pg 156]
infinite trust. If they are too unhappy to endure existence,
the fault is not another's, nor yet the world's; it is their own;
it is innen, the result of errors in a previous life. If they
can never hope to be united in this world, it is only because
in some former birth they broke their promise to wed, or
were otherwise cruel to each other. But they believe likewise
that by dying together they will find themselves at once
united in another world. Sometimes they make a little banquet
for themselves, write very strange letters to parents and
friends, mix something bitter with their rice-wine, and go to
sleep forever. Sometimes they select a more ancient and more
honored method: the lover first slays his beloved with a single
sword stroke, and then pierces his own throat. Sometimes
with the girl's long crape-silk under-girdle (koshi-obi) they
bind themselves fast together, face to face, and so embracing
leap into some deep lake or stream."130

"Bravery has always been the chief ideal of Japanese
character. What beauty meant to the Greeks, and right to
the Romans, and purity to the Hebrews of old, bravery has
meant to Japan."131 In older Japan one of the bravest deeds
was that of taking one's own life when there was a need.
Thus arose the practice of seppuku (belly-cutting) or hara-kiri,
the more common term. This act was performed by
cutting across through one's bowels. This brought into
practice the wearing of two swords, a long one for enemies
and a short one for the wearer's own body. The young men
were taught how to perform this deed upon themselves and
they were so impressed that when the time came for its
performance they were able to meet death without a tremor
and with perfect composure. The young women were taught
the equivalent duty of jigai, which was the piercing of the
throat with a dagger so that a single cut would sever the
arteries.


Work. The children were taught to work. The girl was
instructed in household duties and the care of children. She
was taught how to receive and entertain guests, how to take
care of the rooms and furniture, how to cook and prepare and
serve the dishes, how to do the marketing, how to sew, and all
such duties, so that when she should enter a home of her own
she would know how to perform the duties of wife and mother.

The apprenticeship system was used in Japan. The boy[Pg 157]
had to serve a long apprenticeship with no pay, or but little
pay, although his needs of food, clothing, and lodging were
attended to. Somewhat akin to this was the entering of boys
into the homes of those of distinction and education. The
young men performed the services required about the home
and they were cared for by the ones having them in charge
and given instruction in the things needed by them for the
future.


Education. In the early times of Japan there seems to be
nothing to prove that children received any education other
than domestic training, and the higher classes had a training
in the implements of warfare. Later, schools grew up and
children of both sexes and of all ranks attended the lower
schools and those of higher rank went on into schools of a
higher grade. In the eighth century of the Christian era, a
university was established at the capital and branch schools
in the several provinces. In the university instruction was
given in Chinese literature, history, law, music, medicine,
mathematics, and astronomy and astrology. Students were
sent to China along with the Japanese ambassadors to that
country and some of these students remained for a number
of years to complete their studies.

The art of writing was brought into Japan from Korea
in A.      D. 284. Previous to this it would appear that the
Japanese had no way of recording events, as books and
writing were unknown. Writing was at first with the
Chinese characters, which were used to represent Japanese
words. Later a system was devised whereby only parts of
the Chinese characters were used for writing and a syllabry
was formed.

In the university mentioned above, "the training of the
students in medicine chiefly consisted in making them familiar
with the methods which prevailed in China. The properties
of medicinal plants, the variations of the pulse in health
and disease and in the changing seasons, and the anatomy
of the human body were the chief subjects of study. The
human cadaver was never dissected, but a knowledge of
anatomy was obtained from diagrams which were wholly
hypothetical. In early times medical officers were appointed
to experiment with medicines upon monkeys, and also to
dissect the bodies of monkeys. From these dissections, as
well as from the printed diagrams of Chinese books the
imperfect knowledge which they had reached was derived.[Pg 158]
It was not till 1771 that Sugita Genpaku and several other
Japanese scholars had an opportunity to dissect the body of
a criminal, and by personal observation found the utter
falsity of the Chinese diagrams on which they had hitherto
relied, and the correctness of the Dutch books, which they
had, contrary to the laws of the country, learned to read."132

A large part of the education of the young samurai was
of a military order. He was well trained to ride a horse,
to shoot a bow, and to handle the spear and the sword. The
hara-kiri was an especial part of this training. "They are
instructed as to the proper mode of performing this act, the
ceremonies that should accompany it, varying with the occasion,
and according as it is done publicly or privately, and
under what circumstances a well-bred man should feel himself
obliged thus to destroy himself."133

The girls were taught needlework, music, the arranging of
flowers, etc. They were instructed in household duties and
the things needed by a wife and mother. Some girls received
higher education, becoming able to understand the Chinese
characters used by the Japanese, and they were especially
well learned in the history of their country. "Plutarch tells
us that the ambition of a Spartan woman was to be the wife
of a great man and the mother of illustrious sons. Bushido
set no lower ideal before our maidens; their whole bringing
up was in accordance with this view. They were instructed
in many martial practices for the sake of self-defense, that
they might safeguard their person and their children; in the
art of committing suicide, that in case no alternative opened
to save them from disgrace, they might end their lives in
due order and in comely fashion."134 There were a number
of books, which appeared from time to time, upon the education
of the girl, till a library arose which were often bound
in one volume.

"If the reader will imagine a volume composed of the
Bible, 'Ladies' Letter-writer,' 'Guide to Etiquette,' 'The
Young Ladies' Own Book,' Hannah More's works, Miss
Strickland's 'Queens of England,' a work on household economy,
and an almanac, he will obtain some idea of the contents
of the Bunko, or 'Japanese Lady's Library.' With text and
illustrations, the volume is very large; but if translated and[Pg 159]
printed in brevier with the cuts, it would not probably occupy
more space than one of our largest monthly magazines. The
books composing it, in their order of importance, are the Ōnna
Dai Gakŭ ('Women's Great Learning'       the moral duties of
woman, founded on the Chinese classics); Ōnna Shō Gakŭ
('Woman's Small Learning'       introduction to the above);
Ōnna Niwa no Oshiyé ('Woman's Household Instruction'       duties
relating to furniture, dress, reception of guests, and
all the minutiae of indoor life, both daily and ceremonial);
Ōnna Imagawa ('Moral Lessons' in paragraphs); Ōnna Yō bunshō
('Lady's Letter-writer'); Nijiu-shi Ko ('Twenty-four
Children'       stories about model children in China). Besides
these works of importance, there are Hiyaku Nin Isshiu       a
collection of one hundred poems from as many poets, written
in the old Yamato dialect, and learned in every household,
and perpetually repeated with passionate fondness by old
and young; a collection of lives of model women; household
lore; almanac learning; rules and examples to secure perfect
agreement between man and wife; and a vast and detailed
array of other knowledge of various sorts, both useful and
ornamental to a Japanese maiden, wife, widow, or mother.
This book is studied, not only by the higher classes, but by
the daughters in almost every respectable family throughout
the country. It is read and reread, and committed to memory,
until it becomes to the Japanese woman what the Bible
is to the inmate of those homes in the West in which the
Bible is the first, and last, and often the only book."135

CHAPTER VII

THE CHILD IN PERSIA



Characteristics. Persia proper was a table-land, lying between
the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf, with deep
valleys and rapid rivers. It was such a country, with such
a climate, as required a constant struggle by mankind for
existence. Thus was produced a vigorous race, a race of our
own blood, Aryans, that had one great wave of emigration
to the West, peopling Europe, and a later wave into India.
The Persians were quick, keen-witted, lovers of art and
poetry, filled with energy and courage, and having a very
high regard for truth. "He was free and open in speech,
bold in act, generous, warm-hearted, hospitable. His chief
faults were an addiction to self-indulgence and luxury, a
passionate abandon to the feeling of the hour, whatever that
might happen to be; and a tameness and subservience in all
his relations towards his prince, which seem to moderns
almost incompatible with real self-respect and manliness."136


Women and Marriage. As in other oriental countries, the
parties to a marriage were often betrothed in infancy, and
they had never seen one another till on their wedding-day.
Boys sometimes married at the age of fifteen and girls at
twelve, but as a rule men were between the ages of twenty-five
and thirty and women from fourteen to nineteen. Parents
usually arranged for the marriage of their children, but
sometimes the men would get a female friend to select a
partner for them. When the consent of all had been obtained,
then a formal betrothal took place and gifts were exchanged.

A day having been set for the wedding, on that day the
women would gather at the home of the bride and the men
at the bridegroom's house. As soon as it was dark, the
bride was escorted to the home of the bridegroom, amidst the
beating of drums, the playing of tambourines, and the flashing
of lanterns. Arrived at his house, a man would grasp
the bride about the waist to carry her within, which would[Pg 162]
cause a strife for if this was done by a friend of the bridegroom
then he would in the future be able to maintain due
authority over his wife, but if it was by a friend of the
bride then she "would keep her own side of the house."
When the bride had passed into the reception-room, the bridegroom
made his appearance and he would hold a looking-glass
before her that he might get a good look at her face,
and he was aided in his decision of her looks by the ladies
present who would strive to get a look also at her face. "After
this, the bridegroom takes a bit of sugar-candy, and, biting
it in two halves, eats one himself, and presents the other to
his bride. He then takes her stockings, throws one over his
left shoulder, places the other under his right foot, and orders
all the spectators to withdraw. They retire accordingly, and
the happy couple are left alone."137

There was a form of marriage peculiar to Persia, and which
must have originated in a very early time, in which the
contract was only temporary. In this form a woman would
enter into an agreement to live as a wife with a certain man
for a limited period on consideration of receiving a specified
sum. The time might be for a part of a day or for a long
number of years. If the man should leave the woman before
the time had expired, she received the sum of money just
the same. But she had no other claim upon him nor had she
the right to inherit property from him. At the end of the
time the woman could not marry again for a month and if
then found to be with child a longer time had to elapse
before her marriage again and the child, as well as other
children born to the union, was acknowledged and supported
by the man with whom she had been living.

It is quite well known that incest existed among the ancient
Persians. They even went further in this than did the Egyptians
or Peruvians, as not only were brothers and sisters permitted
to marry but even a mother and son or father and
daughter. As with the ancient Peruvians so with the ancient
Persians, these unions were sometimes required for their
religion called for the offspring of such unions for the
sacrifices.

Since the number of sons a Persian had was a source of
pride to him, this made polygamy a desired and necessary
thing. Hence in ancient Persia a man was allowed to have[Pg 163]
several wives and besides an additional number of concubines,
in order that many sons might be born to him.

Divorce was permitted almost at will to the husband,
custom holding him in check. Another thing that checked
divorce was that the husband had to restore the dowry with
the returning of the woman to her home. The most usual
causes of separation were bad temper, extravagance, or some
complaint of that kind against the wife.


Dress. The boy was dressed somewhat as his father. Of
the poorer classes, the males wore a tunic and trousers of
leather, with a strap or belt around the waist, and high shoes
tied in front with a string. The richer classes wore long
robes with loose hanging sleeves, sleeved tunics reaching to
the knees, fine shoes, drawers under the tunics, gloves on the
hands, and socks or stockings under the shoes. These were
all of rich material and handsomely made. The principal
attire of the women was a wrapper with trousers beneath,
over these was worn a jacket with a shawl, cloak, or furs,
according to the state of the weather, round the head was
wound a silk handkerchief in form similar to a turban, and
on the feet were stockings and slippers. Under Mohammedan
rule, when going out the women put on a long, loose
wrap that enveloped them from head to foot and left only
a small opening for the face, which might be covered with
open lacework or a veil. The girls were dressed similar to
their mothers.


Child and Parent. The boy remained with the women till
his fifth year, his father never seeing him till then, which
was said to have been done to prevent the father from being
afflicted by the loss if the child should die young. "Children
had to yield absolute obedience to their parents; but so convinced
were they of the sacredness of the family tie as
founded on love and reverence that they maintained 'that
never yet did any one kill his father or his mother, but in all
such cases they are sure that, if matters were sifted to the
bottom, it would be found that the child was either a changeling
or else the fruit of adultery, for it is not likely, they say,
that the real father should perish by the hands of the child.'
(Herod.)"138


Inheritance. The Persian was considered to have reached
manhood when he was fifteen years of age. "The offspring[Pg 164]
of the temporary unions, or of any sort of union, are all equal
before the Persian law, which merely subjects them to the
right of primogeniture. At the death of the father, the
eldest son, though born of a slave mother, takes two-thirds
of the succession. The remaining third of the property is
divided amongst the other children, but in such a way that
the share of the boys is half as large again as that of the
girls."139


Amusements. The chief amusements of the Persians were
hunting and playing at dice. The boys no doubt followed
their elders and had imitation hunts. The boys also played
games similar to blindman's buff and tag. They flew kites
and played ball. Boys and girls did not play together. The
girls preferred to sit about and listen to fairy stories, or
at least such was the case in later days. Both boys and girls
were fond of singing.


Education. Among the ancient Persians, education does
not seem to have been given other than to the higher classes,
except that general training that comes through religion and
custom and institutions that would be shared in by every citizen.
Education was not meant to be literary or scholastic
but principally of such a kind as would produce warriors.

There were five periods in the life of the Persian. The first
ended at the fifth year, or, as some claim, at the seventh
year; the second period ended with the fifteenth year; the
third ended at twenty-five; the fourth ended at fifty, and the
fifth period was the time after fifty years of age.

During the first period the child was under the care of
the mother and the other women of the family. "'Up to the
fifth year,' Herodotus tells us, 'they are not allowed to
come into the sight of their father, but pass their lives with
the women. This is done that if the child die young, the
father would not be afflicted with the loss.'"140 The child was
not supposed to be capable of distinguishing between right
and wrong, and so he was taught simply to obey the directions
given him. A child was not to be whipped before his
seventh year, and he was to receive only kind treatment.

At the close of this first period, at the end of the fifth year,
the boy left his mother and went into the care of the state.
This second period was a time of physical training. The
boy was given exercises in running, stone slinging, bow shoot[Pg 165]ing,
and javelin throwing. He was taught to ride, and, later,
to hunt. He was trained to endure heat and cold and hunger
and fatigue. Through the national traditions, the boys
learned of the doings of the heroes and the meaning of noble
deeds. They were taught to speak the truth and learned to
be just and pure and courageous and to gain self-control.
They were instructed in the myths of the gods and other
religious matters, and about the fifteenth year the boys were
invested with the holy girdle.

At fifteen the boy entered the youth period. During this
period military training was the great exercise. The youth
received careful training in the use of military implements,
in the knowledge of military terms and usages, and given the
strict discipline of military life. "The Magi required a higher
education. This must have consisted in the study and explanation
of the sacred writings, and may have included a
limited training in philosophy, astrology, medicine, law, and
finance, so that they were able to become advisers to the
Great King and his satraps."141

At twenty-five the youth was considered a man and he took
his place as a citizen of the state and he continued in service
till his fiftieth year.

Girls received no education other than that of domestic
training, such as was needed in the care of the home, the
rearing of the little children, and the other duties that would
come to the women. Women held a higher place in the family
than was granted to them, for the most part, in other oriental
countries.

There was no educational system in Persia. There was no
real method of instruction. Perhaps no other nation gave
more care to the moral and physical training of the young
than did ancient Persia, yet this was to the almost entire
neglect of intellectual training. The moral training came
through the mingling of the young with their elders and the
military training through imitation of the men at the various
courts. "We know, however, from Strabo and the general
evidence of antiquity that the boys of the higher classes
were brought up together under men of gravity and reputation
at the court of the great king, and also at the lesser
courts of the great nobles and provincial governors."142

Persian life and education tended toward individuality.[Pg 166]
Caste with its repressive influence did not exist in ancient
Persia. The national feeling was intense. The government
was despotic. The ethical aim was high and the individual
was encouraged to high standards of courage, truthfulness,
and purity. But in spite of this,(the education was faulty
in that the individual was trained so strongly in warfare as
to overshadow the ethical side.) As long as Persia was struggling
the ethical standards were maintained alongside the
standards of war so that the individual and the nation could
keep right. But when conquests came, bringing wealth and
power and the lower ethical standards of other nations, the
Persians were unable to bear the strain and so degeneration
went forward fast and the nation found itself unable to withstand
the more vigorous peoples that came against it under
Alexander and so the empire fell, leaving but little impress
on civilization.

CHAPTER VIII

THE CHILD IN JUDEA



Historical. We learn from their own writings that the
Jews arose from peoples that lived in the region of the
Euphrates, a particular tribe of whom, under the leadership
of Abraham, near 2000 B.      C., migrated to the land of Canaan
or Palestine. Here they lived a nomadic life till a portion
of them, the descendants of Jacob, migrated to northeastern
Egypt, from whence some centuries later they were led forth
by Moses and after wanderings and warrings they entered
again into Palestine and built up a nation. After some centuries
internal dissensions arose and the larger part withdrew
and were later forever lost. The smaller portion continued
as a nation and later were carried captives into Babylon and
then restored again to their own country. Then later they
came under the dominion of the Greeks and then under the
Romans. Through this contact with the various civilizations,
through the effect of their environment of both the country
itself and the tribes about them, but more from that something
innate in themselves, they developed into a people that
evolved the great religious idea which, it seems, will dominate
the entire world.


Women and Marriage. Woman was held in high esteem
by the Jews. She mingled freely in private and in public
with others. The Bible is full of the doings of women       as
mothers, as wives, as sisters       showing courage and devotion
and wisdom. She took a leading part in the life of the nation,
especially in religious affairs. She was protected by a religion
that did not debase her but which called for a pure home
and a happy family. Woman was greatly respected in spite
of some of the sayings about her as the following: "It was
observed that God formed woman neither out of the head,
lest she should become proud; nor out of the eye, lest she
should be curious; nor out of the mouth, lest she should be
too talkative; nor out of the hand, lest she should be covetous;
nor out of the foot, lest she should gad about; but out of[Pg 168]
the rib, which was always covered.... As woman is formed
from a rib, and man from the ground, man seeks a wife, and
not vice versa; he only seeks what he lost. This explains why
man is more easily reconciled than woman; he is made of
soft earth and she of hard bone."143

About eighteen was the age at which men generally married,
girls younger. A man under thirteen years and a day
was forbidden to marry, and a woman under twelve years and
a day. Wednesday was fixed as the day for maidens to
marry, and Thursday for widows. If the bride was a maid
each party was allowed twelve months after betrothal in
which to prepare for marriage, in case of a widow but thirty
days were allowed. A widower had to wait over three festivals
and a widow three months before re-marrying. A marriage
could not take place within thirty days of the death
of a near relative, nor on the Sabbath, nor on a feast-day.
Marriage was not permitted with those not in their right
senses, nor in a state of drunkenness. "The Mosaic law
(Lev. XVIII., 7-17; XX., 11, etc.) proscribes no less than
fifteen marriages within specified degrees of both consanguinity
and affinity. In neither consanguinity and affinity,
however, does the law extend beyond two degrees, viz., the
mother, her daughter, aunt, father's wife, sister on the
father's side, wife of the father's brother, brother's wife (excepting
in case of the Levirate marriage), daughter-in-law,
granddaughter either from a son or daughter, and two sisters
together."144

It was generally held that all marriages were arranged in
heaven and that it was proclaimed there, forty days before
the child's birth, just whom he or she should marry. Upon
earth, the parent assumed this part and chose for his child
the one he was to have in life as a partner. This duty
belonged to the father, and if no father, then the mother.
The son might make a personal choice of his bride, so that
the son's wishes might be consulted, but all proposals, nevertheless,
were made by the father. Girls up to twelve years
and a day, minors, could be betrothed by the father and this
was true of all women in the earlier times, but later, if of
age, the woman had to give her own free and expressed consent,
without which a union was invalid. The proposals were
offered usually by the parents of the young man, but if there[Pg 169]
was a difference of rank then they were made by the father
of the girl.

The betrothal was considered as sacred as marriage and
could not be more easily broken. "For a betrothal to be
legal, it has to be effected in one of the following three modes:
1. By money, or money's worth, which, according to the
school of Shammai, must be a denar       90 grains of pure gold       or,
according to the school of Hillel, a perutah       half grain
of pure silver       and which is to be given to the maiden, or,
if she is a minor, to her father, as betrothal price. 2. By
letter or contract, which the young man either in person or
through a proxy, has given to the maiden, or to her father
when she is a minor. 3. By cohabitation, when the young
man and maiden, having pronounced the betrothal formula
in the presence of two witnesses, retire into a separate room.
This, however, is considered immodest, and the young man
is scourged."145

A father was to provide a dowry for his daughter conformable
to her station in life, and should the father not be
able to do this the bridegroom would, before marriage, give
her sufficient for the necessary outfit. In case of an orphan
the dowry was provided from public funds. In earlier times,
after the giving over of the marriage price and other gifts,
the bridegroom took the bride with him. At a later period
a marriage-feast was given at the bride's home, and at a
later period yet the wedding-feast was furnished at the home
of the bridegroom.

Children were very greatly desired by the ancient Hebrews,
and especially male children, as the more children a man had
the more was he respected. Also the expectance of the Messiah,
who might come from any one of the families, made
children all the more wished for. Hence marriage was a duty
with them, and this desire for children was also a cause for
polygamy as thereby more children would be born to a
family. Yet polygamy and concubinage was not the rule
with the Hebrews but the rare exception, so far as the people
generally were concerned, so that they really adopted monogamy
and were, probably, the only Semites who did so. Even
where polygamy or concubinage did occur the law insisted
that each wife or concubine should receive her full conjugal
rights, which prevented any extended practice even among
the most wealthy.[Pg 170]

Divorce was allowed for "any shameful thing," which,
necessarily, was interpreted in different ways. "In fact, we
know that it included every kind of impropriety, such as
going about with loose hair, spinning in the street, familiarly
talking with men, ill-treating her husband's parents in his
presence, brawling, that is, 'speaking to her husband so loudly
that the neighbors could hear her in the adjoining house,' a
general bad reputation, or the discovery of fraud before
marriage. On the other hand, the wife could insist on being
divorced if her husband were a leper, or effected with polypus,
or engaged in a disagreeable or dirty trade, such as
that of a tanner or coppersmith. One of the cases in which
divorce was obligatory was, if either party had become heretical,
or ceased to profess Judaism."146 Yet divorces were
not so common as might be thought under so loose a statement
for procuring them. Rather strict laws were drawn up explicitly
stating for what divorce could be allowed, both to
man and to woman. Divorce was discouraged and a conciliation
was always tried to be brought about before divorce proceedings
began. The divorced parties could marry other
parties and even could unite again. The bill of divorcement
had to be couched in explicit terms, handed to the woman
herself, and in the presence of two witnesses. In separation
of the parents where there were children, the daughters were
placed in charge of the mother and the sons were given to the
father; but should the judge consider it of advantage to the
children, the sons also were given to the mother.

In order that children might be of the best, prostitution
was not allowed and marriage with a prostitute forbidden.
"Marriage with a prostitute was contrary to law, and the
sons of such a woman were denied the political and religious
privileges of citizenship unto the tenth generation."147


Care and Treatment of Children. Although all children
were desired by the Hebrews, yet there was more rejoicing
over the birth of a boy than over the birth of a girl. The
father was not permitted to be present at the birth of the
child, although later the child was given to him, at which time
he placed it on his knees. Sometimes the grandfather was
permitted to be present at the birth of the child.

In the earliest times the mothers nursed their own children,
prolonging this till the child was two and a half and even[Pg 171]
three years old. In later times the wealthier classes employed
nurses for this duty. It was the custom for the boys to be
under the care of the women till the fifth year after which
the father took charge of them.

Perhaps the most important ceremony in the earlier years
of the child was that of circumcision. The child received
its name at this time. Only males were subjected to this. It
was performed on the eighth day of the child's life, even
though it was the Sabbath. If two of the child's brothers had
died from the results of the operation, or if he was weakly,
this was deferred till such a time as there would be no great
danger. This ceremony was of great importance and so the
prescribed rules were strictly adhered to, otherwise it was
not valid. Usually the father performed the operation, yet
it might be done by any Israelite, and even in special cases
by women.

The father had full control of his children. He had the
power to inflict the severest of punishment, even death. He
had greater power over the daughter than over the son, as
he could annul a daughter's vow but not a son's. "When a
child has attained the age of thirteen years and one day, he
is declared of age by his father in the presence of ten Jews,
and then he possesses the legal capacity of acting for himself,
and can make and perform his own contracts. After that
the sins he commits are on his own account. Previously they
were on the account of his father. With respect to girls,
they are accounted women when they arrive at the age of
twelve years and one-half."148


Duties of Children. "Honor thy father and thy mother,"
was the great commandment to the Hebrew child. Undutifulness
was almost unknown among them. Loving consideration
for the parents was one of their strongest marks. Crimes
against parents were scarcely heard of. Respect for old age
was another great duty and one which was carefully observed.
"The general state of Jewish society shows us parents as
fondly watching over their children, and children as requiting
their care by bearing with the foibles, and even the trials,
arising from the caprices of old age and infirmity."149


Dress. The principal garment worn was a tunic, which
encircled the whole body and came down to the knees. Under
this was an inner garment that went down to the heels. Over[Pg 172]
all was a mantle, which was a piece of cloth nearly square,
several feet in length and breadth, which was wrapped round
the body, or tied over the shoulders. A girdle was worn about
the waist, some of which worn by the women were of costly
fabric and studded with precious stones. A kind of turban
was worn on the head. There were three kinds of veils worn.
One hung down from the head, so that the lady could see all
around; a second was a kind of mantilla, which covered the
head and was thrown about the whole person; a third kind
was like the modern oriental veil, covering the face and front,
leaving only the eyes free. Sandals were worn, and the
ladies also wore slippers, some of which were very costly
being embroidered or adorned with gems and so arranged that
the pressure of the foot emitted a delicate perfume.

The hair was considered a chief point of beauty and so it
was well cared for. With the women it was worn long and
curled and plaited and adorned with gold ornaments and
pearls. Auburn hair being a favorite color, sometimes the
hair was dyed and again it was sprinkled with gold-dust. To
keep the hair in place, there were hair-pins and combs. Perfumery
was greatly in use as were cosmetics, the ladies painting
their cheeks and blackening their eyebrows. "As for
ornaments, gentlemen generally wore a seal, either on the
ring-finger or suspended round the neck. Some of them had
also bracelets above the wrist (commonly of the right arm),
made of ivory, gold, or precious stones strung together.
Of course, the fashionable lady was similarly adorned, adding
to the bracelets finger-rings, ankle-rings, nose-rings, ear-rings,
gorgeous head-dresses, necklaces, chains, and what are nowadays
called 'charms.' As it may interest some, we shall
add a few sentences of description. The ear-ring was either
plain, or had a drop, a pendant, or a little bell inserted. The
nose-ring, which the traditional law ordered to be put aside
on the Sabbath, hung gracefully over the upper lip, yet so
as not to interfere with the salute of the privileged friend.
Two kinds of necklaces were worn       one close-fitting, the other
often consisting of precious stones or pearls, and hanging
down over the chest, often as low as the girdle. The fashionable
lady would wear two or three such chains, to
which smelling-bottles and various ornaments, even heathen
'charms,' were attached. Gold pendants descended from the
head-ornament, which sometimes rose like a tower, or was
wreathed in graceful snake-like coils. The anklets were[Pg 173]
generally so wrought as in walking to make a sound like
little bells. Sometimes the two ankle-rings were fastened
together, which would oblige the fair wearer to walk with
small, mincing steps. If to all this we add gold and diamond
pins, and say that our very brief description is strictly based
upon contemporary notices, the reader will have some idea
of the appearance of fashionable society."150


Amusements. It is presumed that Jewish children had
games as the children of other nations, yet but slight account
is given of such. It is noted that they kept tame birds and
imitated marriages and funerals. They also engaged in singing
and dancing, but males and females did not dance together,
and the dancers performed according to their feelings,
wild and fantastic, slow and graceful, nor were there any
set forms for dancing. The youth must have taken part in
the military sports which took place in public. Another
means of entertainment was that of riddles, Samson's well-known
one is an illustration. "Riddles are still 'put forth'
at weddings. Here is a common one:


Black as night, it is not night;
It cuts its wings, it is no bird;
Damaged the house, it is no mouse;
It ate the barley and is no donkey.
Answer       The ant."151


The following is quoted from Jerome: "It is customary in
the cities of Palestine, and has been so from ancient times,
to place up and down large stones to serve for exercises for
the young, who, according in each case to their degrees of
strength, lift these stones, some as high as their knees, others
to their middle, others above their heads, the hands being kept
horizontal and joined under the stone."152


Education. "If we take a general, and at the same time,
it is to be admitted, a somewhat ideal, view of the education
of the Jewish race, we shall find its beginnings and its specific
character expressed in the sixth chapter of Deuteronomy:
'Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord: And
thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and
with all thy soul, and with all thy might. And these words,
which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: And[Pg 174]
thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt
talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou
walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou
risest up....' Accordingly, we may say that a present God,
whom to fear was 'the beginning of wisdom,' the honoring
of parents and elders, a sacred family life, the memory of a
great history, the practical wisdom of proverbs, and a gradually
growing lyric psalmody, constituted the elements of
the education of the masses down to the time of the Exile."153
Thus the education of the Hebrew child began at a very early
age, as it would be taught these essential things as early as
it could understand. The parents would begin its training
in the home. Higher training, and in fact anything beyond
the very rudiments, was given only to the upper classes. The
teachers for the most part were highly respected. They were
expected to be able men, not too young, and married.

In a general way education among the Hebrews may be
divided into two epochs       pre-exilic, from the foundation of
the kingdom down to the return from the Babylonian captivity,
and post-exilic, from the close of the first period to
the fall of Jerusalem and the final dispersion of the Jews.

During the first period there was no public means of education.
Instruction was given by the parents, the very young
child of both sexes being under the mother's care, but when
older the boys went with the father out into his work and so
learned from him. The young people were taught the history
of their own people, their relation to God, the meaning of
the religious feasts, the needed ethical and social training,
and the things necessary for making a living and the care of
the home. "Higher education was scarcely known until after
the exile. Even the priesthood and scribes were limited to
a certain knowledge of law, and of historical and judicial
literature. In the schools of the prophets, besides theological
interpretation and the law, they apparently learned only the
arts of sacred music and poetry, whereby they were to be
stimulated to greater ecstasy, and were instructed in the
compilation of maxims, narratives, and annals. It has been
claimed that they were taught some mathematics and astronomy,
to mark off the religious festivals, but this is very
doubtful."154

During the Captivity, the Hebrews came in contact with[Pg 175]
the education of Babylon, so that upon their return to their
own country education became more general and this continued
to grow till contact with the Greeks and Romans
brought about more general education and the establishment
of schools for the training of the priests and the youth of
the upper classes, and later public elementary schools began
to grow up and became the most prominent feature of Jewish
education. Rich and poor alike attended these schools. Reading
and writing and a little arithmetic were taught the younger
pupils, the older pupils were given instruction in the law.
All pupils were obliged to learn a trade.

In the teaching the children were required to use the
memory a great deal so that frequent repetition was the practice
and, as in other oriental countries, the pupil was to do
this work aloud and should he try to do it quietly he was
reproved. In teaching the child to read, he was first given
the alphabet, the letters being placed on a board for him so
that he could see them. The child had to read aloud to his
teacher, who corrected his pronunciation. The Hebrew Bible
was begun to be read by the child at an early age. In learning
to write, a copy was made in a wax tablet which the child
traced with a stylus, and after a while he followed a copy on
papyrus or parchment with a pen. In the more advanced
work, interpretation of the law, etc., would be given by the
instructor, the youth, would listen attentively and then strive
to reproduce in exact words what had been given.

In the early period, at least, discipline must have severe.
If we are allowed to form an opinion based on the old
Testament, then we must conclude that the rod took a prominent
part in every child's education, and from the authorities
given us it is pretty certain that the ancient Jewish
parent did not spare the rod whether he spoiled the child
or not.

In the early epoch, girls received but little training, only
such as was necessary to the carrying on of the domestic
duties. At no time did girls receive such training as the
boys, but in the second epoch they were taught to read and
to write with dancing and music and domestic arts. Yet it
would seem that there were some women who showed training
beyond the simple subjects and who were able to take a place
alongside the educated men of their times.

Jewish education was unsystematic, narrow, and selfish, art
and science was scarcely known, and the literature was lim[Pg 176]ited
to the ideas connected with their God. Yet there was
produced a beautiful family life, a thoughtful and kind
treatment of children, a higher position for women than with
any other oriental nation, a great reverence for parents, and
a true idea of their relation to the Supreme Being.

CHAPTER IX

THE CHILD IN GREECE



Physical Characteristics. The country of ancient Greece,
as is modern Greece, was a small peninsula in Southeastern
Europe, projecting into the Mediterranean Sea. It was a
mountainous country, with no navigable rivers, and a broken
coast line with many good harbors. There were differences
of climate, varying from the excessive summer heat of the
plains on the coast to the chilling atmosphere of the uplands,
and yet as a whole the climate tended to be mild and even,
with a bracing and pure atmosphere. Although it does seem
that the spirit of freedom and independence was innate with
the Greeks, yet the character of the country and the climate
tended to emphasize these innate propensities and to bring
human culture to a high development.


The People.. In studying the people of ancient Greece,
there are found two countries, although in neighboring sections,
who were almost the opposite in character and the like.
These were Sparta and Athens. In both these countries
there were three classes. In Sparta there were first the citizens,
who were the owners and the rulers of the land; in the
second class were the periaeci, who lived in the surrounding
towns and country, and although free yet they paid large
sums to the citizens for the use of the lands and thus largely
supported the Spartans; the third class were the helots, who
were serfs or slaves and who did all the menial work for the
citizens. The first class in Athens were the citizens, who controlled
the country and who reserved to themselves the sole
right of government and the making of laws; the second
class were the aliens, who had settled in Athens for the purpose
of engaging in trade or commerce, but who had no part
in politics or administration; the third class were the slaves.

The Athenian and the Spartan were almost the opposite in
character. The Athenians were refined, patriotic and brave,
but at the same time fickle and changing. The Spartans were
as patriotic and brave, or even braver, than the Athenians,[Pg 178]
but they were fixed and knew no change. The Athenians cultivated
letters and the finer arts, while the Spartans practiced
rigid, practical utilitarianism. The Athenians engaged
in employments and amusements, but the Spartans did but
little work, had few amusements, and spent their time mostly
in military training. The Spartans were cruel in disposition,
as was shown in their bearing toward the helots or slaves, as
they greatly oppressed them and often put them to death;
while the Athenians treated their slaves kindly.


The Home. In the early times the private buildings both
in Athens and in Sparta were simple, but in later times the
houses became larger and more splendid. Yet there were,
perhaps, not the extravagances as in other countries, for in
Greece much of the time was spent outdoors and away from
the home, so that public buildings flourished and they were
splendidly built rather than were the private houses.

In the cities the houses were built together, with only
party-walls between them. They were narrow in front but
extended back to quite a depth. They were, as a rule, built
on the street but sometimes there was a small space in front.
The door opened out on to the street, instead of inward, and
it was a custom for any one going out to knock on the door
to avoid opening out against some one passing along the street.

The walls of the houses were a framework of wood, sun-dried
brick, or common stone, and covered with stucco. The
roofs generally were flat, made of beams laid close together
and covered with cement. In the early period the walls were
plain on the inside and the ground served for a floor, but
later there were decorated walls and mosaic floors.

There were two principal divisions in the interior of the
houses, the one for the men and the other for the women,
the women's apartments being back of the men's. The rooms
were built around one or more open courts, by means of which
light and air were admitted to the house. The homes were
furnished with chairs and tables and couches and lamps and
other household furniture and the kitchens were provided
with pots and pans and bowls and sieves and many other
articles.


Girls and Women. In the heroic age of Greece, women
were accorded much freedom. Yet it would seem that their
lot was not much above that found with women in savagery.
They had the heavy household cares and duties of savage
women. They had the management of the provisions       the[Pg 179]
grinding of the grain, the preparing of the meals, etc. They
had to look after the clothing, doing the spinning and the
weaving and the making of the garments. They carried the
heavy burdens of domestic life along with the care of the
children. Yet the women were well respected and had high
standing with the men of that time.

In Sparta the state was everything. Strong and vigorous
men were needed to protect the state and so must be provided
for military life, and the mothers who were to bear them
must be strong and courageous. The girls and women were
allowed much greater freedom than in other parts of Greece.
The girls received vigorous training, such as was given to
the boys, having contests among themselves and even sometimes
with the boys. In some of these contests the girls had
to divest themselves of their apparel and appear thus before
the public. This coming in contact with the males, the great
freedom allowed to them, and the vigorous training did not
spoil the purity of the girls, for adultery was scarcely known
in Sparta. Nor did the training impair their physical appearance,
as the Spartan women were noted for their beauty
of person, although on account of the vigorous physical training
this beauty was somewhat of a masculine type.

Women in Athens were treated quite differently to what
they were in Sparta. There was seemingly a contempt by the
men for the women and especially so among the leaders and
rulers. "The most enlightened of the Greeks limited the
duties of a good wife, housewife, and mother, to the following
points: 1. That she should be faithful to her husband. 2. That
she should go abroad and expose herself to the view of
strangers as little as possible. 3. That she should take care
of what the husband acquired, and spend it with frugality;
and, 4. That she should pay maternal attention to the younger
children of both sexes, and keep an incessantly watchful eye
upon her grown-up daughters."155

In Athens the women were closely watched and carefully
guarded. They were usually placed in the back part of the
house and in the highest rooms, and for the most part the
women and girls passed their time in the apartments allotted
to them. There was no intercourse between young men and
young women. Women were considered men's inferiors and
they were thought little better than the slaves and they had
but little more influence with the men. Woman was looked[Pg 180]
upon as an entirely lower being intellectually than man, and
so not a fit companion for him in public life. When men
outside the household were present in the home, the women
were expected to seclude themselves. When a dinner was
being given the company consisted entirely of men and the
wife kept herself and her children in the women's quarters.
The young women rarely went from home. Even if it was
necessary for them to appear in public religious ceremonies,
they did not take part in common with the other sex but
acted apart from them.

Thus the training of the Athenian girl and that of the
Spartan girl were quite in contrast and while the Athenian
girl grew up to be a pale, slender lady, but little versed in
the ways of the world, the Spartan girl grew up to be a
vigorous, robust, healthy woman, ready even to take part in
public debate if necessary. Yet there was at least one class
of women in Athens not secluded, for "in the London market
of Billingsgate it is the fishwomen who have been notorious
for abusive language; at Athens it was the bread-women."156

A discussion of the women of Greece could not be complete
without including the much discussed but little understood
class known as the Hetairai, the stranger-women of Athens.
Whether they were simply courtesans or whether they were
women seeking freedom from the restraints and seclusion of
the wife or whether they were both courtesans and seeking
freedom and education, they certainly exercised a remarkable
influence in Greece.

There were two classes of women at Athens, the first class
being the wives and mothers, the citizen-women of Athens,
and the other class being the stranger-women. Athens did
not exclude strangers and indeed it was an attractive place
to foreigners. "The city itself was full of attractions for
the stranger, with its innumerable works of art, its brilliant
dramatic exhibitions, its splendid religious processions, its
gay festivals, its schools of philosophy, and its keen political
life."157 Although they did not exclude strangers from the
city, yet they did exclude them from governing citizenship.
Nor was a citizen, male or female, allowed to marry a stranger
and severe penalties were inflicted on those who broke this[Pg 181]
law. Since the stranger-women could not marry Athenian
men, they had to gain their companionship by other means.
The citizen-women, the native women of Athens, were not
allowed the company of men nor were they given high accomplishments.
"The names of these wives are not to be
found in history. But the influence of the Companions came
more and more into play. Almost every famous man, after
this date, has one Companion with whom he discusses the
pursuits and soothes the evils of his life. Plato had Archeanassa,
Aristotle Herpyllis, Epicurus Leontium, Isocrates
Metaneira, Menander Glycera, and others in like manner.
And some of them attained the highest positions.... Some
were renowned for their musical ability, and a few could
paint. They cultivated all the graces of life; they dressed
with exquisite taste; they took their food, as a comic poet remarks,
with refinement, and not like the citizen women, who
crammed their cheeks, and tore away at the meat. And
they were witty. They also occupied the attention of historians."158
"Thus arose a most unnatural division of functions
among the women of those days. The citizen-women
had to be mothers and housewives       nothing more; the
stranger-women had to discharge the duties of companions,
but remain outside the pale of the privileged and marriageable
class."159

The two most noted of the hetairai were Aspasia and
Phryne. "Phryne, the most beautiful woman that ever lived,
attracted the eyes of all Greece; Apelles painted her, and
Praxiteles made her the model for the Cnidian Aphrodite,
the most lovely representation of woman that ever came from
sculptor's chisel."160 "Aspasia, the beautiful, accomplished,
and highly gifted woman, a native of Miletus, first the mistress
and subsequently the wife of Pericles, exercised an
influence and a power in Greece very greatly superior to any
ever exercised there by any other woman. She was endowed
with a mind more beautiful than her beautiful form. Her
genius drew around her all those who had a taste for the
beautiful, or a desire to cultivate their minds. At her house,
eloquence, politics and philosophy were daily discussed, and
ladies of the highest rank resorted thither to acquire some
of the accomplishments by which she was distinguished.[Pg 182]
Large concessions must certainly be made to the mind that
could be a fit companion for Pericles, and could teach rhetoric
to Socrates."161


Marriage. In most cases Greek marriage was not an
affair of the heart, for young people had but little opportunity
to be with one another for love-making. Marriage
for the man was rather a matter of convenience, for the
purpose of the continuation of his family. This was a duty
he owed to himself and to the state, for the state must have
citizens for its perpetuation. To the Greek public life meant
everything, the home counted but little. The wife's duties
were considered to be the attending to household affairs and
the bearing of children.

Marriage had to be with the consent of the parents. The
young woman had no control over her person as she was
under the charge of her father, and upon his death of a
brother, and in case of no brother then the grandfather, and
last her guardian. The father not only had power over his
daughter's marriage in his lifetime but also after his death
as he could bequeath her by will. And yet more, for upon
his deathbed he could betroth his wife to another person and
even he could bequeath her in his will to another.

In order for the children to be legitimate both parties had
to be citizens of the state, and equality of birth and wealth
were the chief considerations. The man could not marry in
the direct line of his own descent, yet he could marry his
half-sister on his father's side, which was rarely done. There
was usually some years of difference in the age of bride and
groom, the young woman being from fifteen to twenty and
the young man from twenty-four to thirty. Marriages were
most frequent in the winter, January being the favorite
month, and when the omens were favorable, the most favorable
being at the time at which there happened to be a conjunction
of the sun and the moon. The selections and arrangements
were usually made by the father or the guardian
but often a professional matchmaker was employed, who was
well informed in regard to the marriageable young people.
When the marriage was determined upon, the betrothal took
place, which was made by the legal guardian of the young
woman and in the presence of friends and relatives of both
parties, the dowry of the wife being agreed upon at the time.

In ancient Greece the lover would often write the name[Pg 183]
of his loved one on walls and columns and carve it on trees.
He would even write the beloved name on the leaves of the
trees. The lover would send verses to his lady love. He
would decorate her door with flowers and garlands. He
would wear a wreath on his head awry or wear it untied, as
a token of his being in love. Sometimes the lover would make
an image of wax, call it by the name of his loved one, and
place it near a fire, as the heat was supposed to melt the hard
heart of her he loved as it melted her wax image.

Love potions were in common use as were also antidotes
to love. "Some herbs were made use of for this purpose,
also insects bred from putrid matter; the lamprey, the lizard,
the brains of a calf, the hair on the extremity of the wolf's
tail, with some of his secret parts, and the bones of the left
side of a toad eaten by ants. The bones on the right side
were supposed to cause hatred. Besides these, were also used
the blood of doves, the bones of snakes, the feathers of screech
owls, and bands of wool twisted upon a wheel, more especially
such as had been bound about a person that hanged himself....
The Greeks also professed to have the means of allaying
the passion of love, at least of that species of it which originated
from magical incantations. The antidotes were of
two kinds. The one consisted of those substances which possessed
some natural virtue, to which the production of the
effect might be attributed, as the herbs which were supposed
enemies to generation. The other included all such as
wrought the cure by some occult or mystical power, and by
the assistance of demons. As instances of this latter, may be
cited the sprinkling of the dust in which a mule had rolled
herself, and the confining of toads in the hide of a beast lately
slain. Another method of curing love, was to wash in the
water of the river Selemnus."162

In the Homeric time in Greece, the suitor paid the father
for his bride, thus purchasing her. But in later times this
was entirely changed and the bride was expected to bring
a dowry with her. Among the wealthy this dowry was supposed
to consist partly in cash and partly in clothes, jewelry,
and slaves. The husband had to give security for it, as in
case of divorce it was returned to the bride or to her parents
and in case of her death it did not go to the husband but to
the nearest of kin. Where there was a daughter of a poor,
deserving citizen, and especially if her ancestors had been[Pg 184]
serviceable to the state, she was provided a dowry by the
state. Sometimes the dowry was given to such a girl by a
number of citizens. The dowry was supposed to give the
wife better standing and thus bring more respect from the
husband and greater freedom. A woman might carry so
great dowry to her husband as to make her the stronger
partner and so be able to have her husband in submission to
her and her money.

The day of the wedding having arrived, offerings were
made to the deities that protected marriage, the oath of
fidelity was taken, and the father declared that he gave his
daughter to the man. The bride and bridegroom both were
bathed, at Athens the water being taken from a famous fountain,
and they were dressed in their wedding-garments, both
bride and bridegroom being richly adorned and wearing upon
their heads garlands of various herbs and flowers. The bride
was then led from her home and placed in a chariot between
the bridegroom and his best man. They then drove slowly
through the streets, the bride's mother following them and
carrying the wedding torches, kindled at the parental hearth,
and a procession of relatives and friends followed. At the
bridegroom's home the axle-tree of the chariot was broken
or burned, to designate that the bride having found a new
home would never return to her old home. The bridegroom's
house was decked with garlands and brilliantly illuminated.
The couple were met by his mother bearing torches, and surrounded
by a group of dancing-girls they came to the door,
and at the threshold the bride made a pretense of not wishing
to enter, when the bridegroom seized her and carried her
inside, seeing that her feet did not touch the sill. All then
partook of a feast, consisting of wines, meats, sweetmeats,
and wedding-cake, the women with the veiled bride among
them sitting apart from the men. The final ceremony consisted
in the eating of a quince by husband and wife together,
to signify, perhaps, because of the bitter-sweetness, that they
should partake of the sweets and bitters of life together, our
"for better or worse." Then the guests departed and the
couple entered the bridal chamber, where for the first time
the bride unveiled herself to her husband. At the last the
bridal hymn was sung before their door by a chorus of maidens.
The next morning the chorus returned and saluted the
married couple with songs. This was the day of "unveiling,"
as the bride unveiled herself, and the newly married[Pg 185]
couple spent the entire day in receiving visits with salutations
and presents from their friends.

"The marriage ceremonies of the Spartans differed from
those of all the other Greeks. Instead of having a public
celebration, everything was there done in as private a manner
as possible. When everything had been settled between
the parties, the bridegroom at night made a secret visit to his
bride at her father's house. Before day he returned to his
comrades, at the gymnasia, and never, for a long time, visited
his wife except at night and by stealth, as it was accounted a
disgrace to be seen coming out of his wife's apartment. They
sometimes lived in this clandestine manner for years, not
unfrequently having children by their wives before they
ever saw their faces by daylight."163

As citizenship was limited in the states of Greece, it became
highly important that the citizens should perpetuate the state
by marrying and having children. So the state would encourage
marriage and make it honorable and likewise almost
compulsory and unmarried men would not be wanted nor
would marriage deferred till late in life be considered the
best for the state. In both Athens and Sparta bachelors
were subject to a legal penalty. In Athens those who held
public office and were entrusted with public affairs had to
be married, to have children, and to have estates in land.
Sparta was quite severe on the bachelors. If a man delayed
marriage after a specified age, he subjected himself to a
number of penalties. One was for once each winter to go
naked around the market-place and sing a song ridiculing
his bachelorhood. Such men were not permitted to be present
at the contests wherein young women engaged in a nude
condition. Upon the celebration of a certain solemnity, the
bachelors were dragged around the altar by the women who
beat them with their fists. When these men became old they
were not accorded that high respect which the young of
Sparta was accustomed to pay to the aged.

Monogamy was early established in Greece as the basis
of society. There were some instances of polygamy or rather
concubinage in the early ages and on some occasions where
large number of men were lost in war or from other causes.
This might have been resorted to in order to replenish the
state but this was of rare occurrence.

In early times in Greece divorce was in the hands of the[Pg 186]
husband and he could exercise it whenever he felt that he
was justified but in later times this right was somewhat restricted.
The Spartans seldom divorced their wives. In
Athens divorce was easy for the man, but a bill of divorce
was required to be presented to the magistrate in which the
reasons for the divorce were set forth. They would, no
doubt, have been more frequent had it not been that in
divorce the husband had to restore the dowry to the wife
or pay her a sum each month for her support. For a man
to divorce his wife was considered a great dishonor to her.
It was difficult for a woman to procure a divorce, Athens
being more favorable to women in this respect than the other
states of Greece. But here she had to present a bill of
grievances to the magistrate and it required his action before
separation could take place. "The terms expressing the
separation of men and women from each other were different.
The men were said to dismiss their wives; to loose them from
their obligations; to cast them out; to send them away; to
put them away. If a woman left her husband, it was termed
simply to depart from him."164


Dress. The articles of dress worn by the Greeks were of
two kinds       one drawn on or got into, a tunic, called by the
general term endymata; the other thrown over the person, a
mantle, known as the epiblemata. Of the first kind the chiton
was the representative garment, which was worn next to the
body. The chiton in its usual form was an oblong piece of
cloth and thrown about the body in such a way as to leave
an opening for one arm to go through, while the two ends
of the open side were fastened over the other shoulder by
means of a buckle or clasp. Sometimes the chiton was made
with two sleeves, with one sleeve, or with short sleeves. In
some cases, as with workmen, it was thrown across the left
shoulder with the right arm and shoulder entirely bare, so
as to be left free for action. The chiton was fastened about
the waist by a ribbon or girdle. The representative of the
epiblemata was known as the himation. This was also an
oblong piece of cloth, one corner of which was thrown over
the left shoulder in front, drawn across the back to the right
side, sometimes below the right arm and sometimes over it,
and then it was thrown again over the left shoulder.

Boys commonly wore only the chiton. The young men,
from the age of seventeen to twenty, called the ephebi, in[Pg 187]stead
of the himation wore the chlamys, which was an oblong
cloth, thrown over the left shoulder and the open ends were
fastened over the right shoulder with a clasp. The himation
of Sparta was smaller than that at Athens, scarcely
covering the person, and which was called the tribon. The
women wore the chiton and the himation and in addition
they wore another garment over the chiton, called the
crocotos, which sometimes had sleeves and was of a rich
purple or saffron color and frequently had a broad border
of embroidery. The Doric maidens usually wore but a single
loose woolen garment. It was without sleeves and fastened
over the shoulders with clasps. It usually extended about
half way to the knees, it was worn with or without a girdle,
and the left side was left open, which might or might not
have been fastened with a buckle or clasp.

The garments were made of linen, cotton, or wool, and in
later times silk also was used. White was, perhaps, the
prevailing color and yet many colors were used, as, purple,
red, green, yellow, gray, brown, olive, azure, cherry, and
changeable colors. If the entire dress was not colored, it
might have had colored borders, embroidery, or stripes,
worked in or sewed on, and sometimes there were fringes
or tassels. The undergarment, in time of mourning, was
sometimes black.

The Greeks, both men and women, were especially careful
of the hair. The men wore their hair and beard long and
they had the hair curled or braided and bound up in a large
bunch on top of the head or it might be arranged along the
forehead and kept in place with golden grasshoppers.
Dandies went to extremes and let their hair grow till it fell
down on the shoulders. Most of the men had thick hair. In
the cities the men usually went bareheaded but sometimes
they wore hats or caps, when at work and on journeys.

The Grecian women for the most part had long, rich hair
and, naturally, they took even more care of it than did the
men with their hair. Sometimes it was allowed to fall loosely
down the back; sometimes the hair was combed over the back
in waving lines and a ribbon tied around the head; it might
be that the front hair was combed back over the temples and
ears and tied at the back of the head in a knot, held in place
with hairpins of ivory, bronze, bone, gold, or silver; and there
were many other ways of keeping the hair.

The hair of children was carefully attended to. The girls'[Pg 188]
hair was often twisted into artistic curls and then drawn together
over the forehead and held by a fancy comb. In
Sparta the boys' hair was kept short till their majority had
been reached, when it was allowed to grow long. Among the
Athenians the hair of the boys was permitted to grow till
they had reached maturity, when it was cut off and burned
to some deity, after which it was allowed to grow long again.

There were oils, perfumes, ointments, and essences for the
hair. Curling-irons were in use for curling the hair. Powders
were used on the hair and especially the kind that gave
it an auburn color. There were dyes for the hair and they
were well resorted to. Nets were used by the ladies to enclose
their hair, and veils of a light fabric and of transparent
texture were worn. On festive occasions wreaths and garlands
were worn by both men and women.

Among the Greeks the hands were not usually covered,
gloves rarely being worn. The feet were not covered in
the house and even sometimes in the street there was no
covering to the feet. There was a great variety of foot-wear
from the simple sandal to the high boot, the three main
kinds being the sandal, the shoe, and the boot.

The sandal was the simplest form of foot-covering. This
consisted of a sole of wood or leather, or it might be two
pieces of leather with a piece of cork between. This was
held on the foot by means of a strap or thong passing between
the big toe and the next and running back along the
top of the foot and fastened to another strap going over the
instep and another that passed round the back of the heel.
Occasionally slippers were worn, which among the women
were ornamented with needle work.

From the sandal was evolved the half shoe, covering the
front part of the foot, and then the shoe, covering all the
foot, which arose from the addition of a closed heel and
smaller or larger side-pieces sewed to the sole. The working-people
of both town and country had the soles studded with
iron nails, while the dandy in the city might have had gold
or silver nails in his shoes. The women regulated their stature,
increasing or diminishing the height, by means of high
or low heels and soles of different thickness. The children
at Athens began to wear shoes at an early age. In the boot
the covering reached to the calf of the leg, open in front,
and fastened with laces.

In the footwear was where novelty and taste was shown[Pg 189]
by the Greeks. There was fashion in shoes and they often
were named for those who originated the styles. They were
very careful about neatness of fit and appearance. It was
not considered good taste to wear patched or mended shoes.
Black, white, and colored shoes were worn. Blacking was
used, which was a kind of polish. The material was usually
leather but felt also was used and slippers were sometimes
made of linen. Socks and stockings seem to have been worn,
but they were not in common use.

In the heroic times of Greece, as described by Homer, men
wore earrings, necklaces, armlets, fancy girdles, hair ornaments,
and finger-rings. In later times all these were discarded
except the finger-rings, and these were usually signet
rings. The women continued to use all kinds of ornaments.
They wore both signet and jeweled rings on their fingers,
some of the latter being set with beautiful and costly jewels;
they wore necklaces of many patterns, varying from the simple
ring to elaborate pendants; they wore armlets, bracelets,
and anklets, usually in the form of spiral snakes; they wore
a diadem or fillet to keep the hair in place; they wore ornamented
girdles. The ornaments mentioned above were
usually of gold and adorned with gems, as they used many
kinds of precious stones.

The ladies dyed their hair and bleached it and increased
its amount by adding other hair; they used tooth-powder;
they blackened their eyebrows; a dark complexion was whitened
and one too pale was rouged; their lips were touched
with vermillion. To aid in this decorating, they had mirrors,
which were made of bronze and usually circular, either without
a handle or with one richly adorned.

The ladies had parasols, much like the ones at present,
which could open and shut by means of wires, and which they
carried themselves or had servants to hold over them. They
had fans of peacocks' feathers or of thin light wood. Canes
were used by the men both in Sparta and Athens, which were
mostly of great length and with crook handles.

The ladies of Old Greek times well understood how to
adorn, enhance, and remodel the human figure. As was
stated above, they hung on to the figure all kinds of ornaments       rings,
necklaces, earrings, bracelets, etc.; they could
curl and dye and increase the amount of hair; they painted
and powdered the cheeks and eyebrows and lips; they knew
how to increase or diminish the stature by means of the heels[Pg 190]
and soles of the shoes; and they knew the art of enlarging
or diminishing the figure by means of corsets and padding.
Not only did they know all these things, but also they understood
how to display to best advantage any part of the figure
that was beautiful, as, a woman having pretty white teeth
knew how and when to laugh to best display them and the
handsome mouth.


Food. In the earlier times of Greece, when the food supply
was limited to a narrow territory, there was frugality and
little variety. As commerce increased the food supply became
greater and of a varied character, and yet the Greeks were
for the most part frugal and temperate.

There were usually three meals a day       a light breakfast,
a heavier meal near midday, while the principal meal was
toward the close of the day. When the family ate alone, the
father reclined on a couch, the mother sat on a chair near
him, and the children sat about them, the younger perhaps
on the mother's lap or on the couch by the father.

The bread was made from wheat and barley and also from
rye, millet, spelt, and rice. The bread sold by the bread-women
in Athens had a big reputation all over Greece.
Among their cakes was one made of wheat and honey, another
of rice, cheese, eggs, and honey, and a third of cheese,
eggs, and garlic. Beef, mutton, goat's flesh, and pork, were
the most common meats. Poultry was abundant and eggs
were used in various ways. There was plenty of wild game,
as, the partridge, wild pigeons, wild geese, deer, hares, and
wild boars. Hot sausages were greatly liked and they were
sold on the streets of Athens and perhaps in other cities.
Fish were abundant, both fresh-water and salt, and oysters,
eels, mussels, and turtles were used as food. Among the
vegetables were lettuce, spinach, cabbage, peas, beans, radishes,
onions, garlic, turnips, and asparagus. The food was
seasoned with salt, mustard, garlic, onions, and herbs. Honey
was used as sugar with us and olive-oil and cheese took the
place of butter. Of fruits there were figs, apples, quinces,
peaches, pears, plums, cherries, grapes, and of nuts there
were walnuts, almonds, and chestnuts. Wine was in great
use and, perhaps, there was no other beverage but water as
milk was not often drunk except in the country.

After being weaned, the child at Athens was fed by its
mother or nurse with milk and a weak broth, which consisted
mostly of honey. The older Athenian child no doubt[Pg 191]
had an abundance and a variety of food, but such was not
the case in Sparta. Taken to the public tables at seven years
of age, the Spartan child was given only very coarse food
and not nearly a sufficient quantity of this. He was permitted,
however, to steal more food, but if caught he was
severely punished.


Child and Parent. One of the worst things that could
happen to a Greek in the old times was not to have children,
and especially not to have a son. Although daughters were
not disliked, yet it was through the son that the family name
and the worship of family gods and ancestors could be continued
after the death of the father. There was more, for
the state considered childlessness and especially no sons in
a family unfortunate, as it was thought such a condition
lessened the ties between citizen and state. So when a boy
was born into a family the outer door was decorated with
an olive branch, while for a girl a fillet of wool was used.

"The Grecian mothers were subjected to certain rules
prior to the birth of their children. Their food and exercises
were regulated either by the laws, or by the manners
and customs. In most of the Grecian states they were required
to lead a sedentary, inactive, and tranquil life. In
Sparta, however, it was directly the reverse. There, women
while in that condition were required to be abroad, engaged
in their usual athletic recreations, eating and drinking as at
any other period of time."165


Care of Children. The newly born child was bathed in
water and oil and then it was put into swaddling clothes,
a narrow woolen band wrapped tightly round and round the
child from the neck to the feet. In Sparta the newly born
child was bathed in water tempered with wine, as it was considered
strengthening to the child and also that such a bath
could be endured only by strong and healthy infants. The
baby was not placed in swaddling clothes in Sparta, so that
it was allowed the freedom of its limbs and body.

There were two family festivals observed with the young
child. The first was of a religious nature, the ceremony of
purification, and it usually took place on the fifth day after
birth. The child was held in the arms of the nurse, midwife,
or some member of the family, who ran round a fire blazing
on the family altar, followed by the members of the household.
This was done that the child might thus be placed[Pg 192]
under the care of the household gods. It was ended with a
feast. The second festival was that of the name-day, which
occurred on the child's tenth day after birth. This was a
very important event in the life of the child, as on this occasion
the infant was acknowledged by the father as his own
and he committed himself to its rearing and education. A
feast was held, a special cake was eaten, a sacrifice was offered,
chiefly to the goddess of child-bearing, and the baby
was given a name. Presents were given to the child, among
them being charms or amulets and which were hung around
its neck to protect it against magical arts and the evil eye.
The favorite name for the eldest son was that of his paternal
grandfather. Sometimes the boy was named for his father
or there might be a shortened form of the grandfather's or
father's name. He might be named for an intimate friend
or for some god or for some action or condition or experience
in his father's life. Later in life the boy might
receive a nickname that would take the place of his real
name.

In the earlier times the mothers both of Athens and Sparta
nursed their children, but later this was abandoned and
nurses were procured. Wet-nurses were employed for the
baby's first year or a half year longer and then a regular
nurse was obtained for the child. In Sparta the nurses were
usually from the women of the perioeci, and the other peoples
of Greece preferred the Spartan nurses because they were
strong and healthy and also gave the children a vigorous training.
"When the child grew to some understanding, the
nurse told stories out of the great wealth of Greek mythology
and Æsopian beast fables which circulated among the Greeks
from the earliest times; also ghost stories, chiefly to frighten
and subdue the rebellious: about the horrible bugaboo called
Mormo; about Acco, who carried off bad children in a huge
sack; or Lamia, once a princess, who ate her own and others'
children; or Empūsa, a hobgoblin that took any shape it
pleased. If these stories failed to restrain the naughty child,
then the sandal was vigorously applied."166

The earlier cradle was of basket-work, in the form of a
flat swing. A later one was shaped like a shoe, having handles
at the sides for carrying and suspending. In yet later
times appeared cradles similar to those of modern times.[Pg 193]
Lullabies were sung over children as now. One cradle-song
has come down to us in this form:


"Tenderly she touched their little heads and sang:
Sleep, baby boys, a sweet and healthful sleep;
Sleep on, my darlings, safely through the night,
Sleep, happy in your baby dreams, and wake
With joy to greet the morning's dawning light."167



Infanticide. If in Sparta the child survived the bath of
water and wine, then it was subjected to an inspection by a
council of the state to decide whether it was fit to live or
not. The strong and robust children were permitted to live,
but the weak and sickly and deformed children were thrown
down a precipice or exposed on the mountains. If any of
the helots or perioeci should find the child and take it they
were permitted to keep it, but the child could never become
a citizen of Sparta. This custom of destroying or casting
out infants was done in order to insure strong citizens for
the state. No parent was allowed to pass judgment on the
child, such was retained by the state alone.

Infanticide was practiced in Athens, but not by the state.
This was wholly in the hands of the fathers. The fathers
at Athens were more cruel than the state at Sparta, for not
only weak and deformed children were cast aside by the
Athenian fathers, but this might be true of other children,
as poverty and other causes might be a motive. This was
done by placing the infant in a basket or earthenware vessel
and leaving it in a temple, or some other public place, so
that some one might take it. This was called "potting" the
child. The mother usually placed a token as a trinket or
an amulet with the child so that possibly afterward the child
might be recognized. The party who might take such a
child had full power over it and might rear it as a slave
or do with it as he might wish. The father was sometimes
brutal enough to take the baby to the mountains and leave
it to die from exposure or wild beasts.

"From this barbarous custom the Thebans formed an honorable
exemption. They rendered the murder of infants a
capital offense. Those who were born of parents unable to
provide for their maintenance were brought up at the public
charge, but in return, when grown up, the public had a right[Pg 194]
to their services until they were adequately compensated for
what had been expended in bringing them up."168


Duties of Children. The boy at Greece was expected to
walk along the street in a quiet manner with head bent, as
a sign of modesty, and to speak to no one. At home he
was to be careful of his manners and habits. He was to be
respectful to his elders, making way for them on the street,
keeping silence in their company, and when seated to arise
when they entered the room and to give way to them. It
was the duty of children to be obedient and respectful to
their parents, and to care for them when there was need.
But the parents, too, had their duty to perform and if they
neglected the children then the children were excused from
maintaining their parents.


Adoption and Inheritance. People not having children of
their own were permitted to adopt other children. If a man
had no son he could adopt a young man and have him marry
his daughter. Those adopted were accorded all the rights
and privileges of any children. The children of an adopted
son were regarded as descendants of the adopting father and
they preserved the ancestral worship and paid homage at his
tomb. If after adopting a son the man should marry and
have a son from this marriage, then the two boys received
equal shares of the property upon the death of the father.
When there were neither legitimate nor adopted sons, the
estate went to the nearest relatives. In case of death without
heirs, the estate descended to the prince, the commonwealth,
or the supreme magistrate, as the laws directed. Sometimes
if the children of noted men were left without property,
they were provided for by the state. Children could
be disinherited, but such had to be done publicly before certain
judges appointed for that purpose. When a parent was
unable, through age or infirmity, to manage his estate the son
could bring this before magistrates, who had the power to
turn over the property to the son, who would care for the
property and the parent.


Toys and Playthings. The children of ancient Greece had
quite a number of toys and playthings. The infant's first toy
was a rattle, made of metal or wood, having small stones inside.
A little older they had painted clay puppets, representing
human beings and such animals as tortoises, hares,
ducks, and mother apes with their offspring. Dolls were[Pg 195]
plentiful, made of painted clay or wax, often with movable
hands and feet. "In more than one instance we have found
in children's graves their favorite dolls, which sorrowing
parents laid with them as a sort of keepsake in the tomb."169
The little girls had houses for their dolls and dishes and
tables. The children had ships and tops and balls and hoops
and carts and swings. They also had pet animals. Sometimes
the toys were bought and again they were made by
the children, for, through instinct and imitation, they were
much given to modeling and making things out of clay or
wax or fruit-peel or leather. This is well illustrated by a
passage from "The Clouds" of Aristophanes, wherein he has
a countryman describing the precocious abilities of his son:


"He is a lad of parts, and from a child
Took wondrously to dabbling in the mud,
Whereof he'd build you up a house so natural
As would amaze you, trace you out a ship,
Make you a little cart out of the sole
Of an old shoe, mayhap, and from the rind
Of a pomegranate cut you out a frog,
You'd swear it was alive."170



Games and Plays. Just as with children in all ages and
in all times, the children of Greece had many plays and
games. The little boys and girls were in the homes together
till they were seven years of age and so they played together,
but apart after that. The boys of Athens, just as in other
cities in older times and present times, played on the streets
and pestered the passers-by and kept the guardians of the
peace busy.

The little girls played with their dolls, making houses for
them, setting out dishes before them, hauling them in carts,
and swinging them and themselves in swings. In some of
their plays they were joined by the little boys and they all
played in the sand and made mud-pies and had see-saws and
swings and they hitched up one another and dogs and goats
to carts. The children carried one another pick-a-pack and
they rode stick-horses and hobby-horses and they played bob-cherry
and hide-the-rope and many other such games.

They rolled hoops, walked on stilts, played running and
catching games, such as hide-and-seek; they played leapfrog,
hopped and jumped, flew kites; they played games of[Pg 196]
forfeit, odd or even, how many fingers are held up; the older
boys had the tug of war and tossed one another in blankets.
In one game the boy had to hop with one foot on a skin-bottle
filled with water and greased; they spun coins on the
edges; they shot beans from the fingers as the modern boys
do marbles; they threw up five small stones and caught them
on the back of the hand, as boys do jack-stones now; they
played with dice.

There was a game in which a stone was to be so thrown
into a circle as to knock out the stones thrown into it by the
other boys and itself remain in the circle. They would
sharpen one end of a heavy peg of wood and then throw it
into a softened place in the earth so that it would stand upright
and also knock out another's peg. They would blacken
or moisten one side of an oyster-shell and would call one side
day and the other side night; then the boys would divide into
two sides with these names and would take turns in tossing
the shell up into the air and then note which side was up
when it fell to the ground; the winning side would then
pursue the others and take prisoners.

The boys, then as now, found great sport with tops, playing
in the house as well as in the street. They had different
kinds of tops, among them being a humming-top. The Greek
boy would tie a long string to the leg of a beetle and then
let it loose and guide its flying by holding to the string;
sometimes the boys would fix a wax splinter to the beetle's
tail and then light it before letting him loose.

The children played blind man's buff. They would bandage
a boy's eyes, who would then go about calling out,
"I am hunting a brazen fly." This would be answered by
the others with, "You will hunt, but you won't catch it."
They would then run about and strike him with whips till
he caught one, who would then be blindfolded.

The Greeks were very fond of the ball and ball-playing.
The balls were of all sizes and colors. Some were stuffed
with feathers and wool and others were empty. They were
made of leather and of such a size as was suited to the kind
of game to be played with them. There was tossing and
throwing and juggling with balls and also there were regular
games. Mahaffy thinks that he has discovered from the
descriptions given that they played games similar to the
present foot-ball, hand-ball, and lacrosse. He believes foot-ball
is shown in this description: "The first is played by[Pg 197]
two even sides, who draw a line in the center, on which they
place the ball. They draw two other lines behind each
side, and those who first reach the ball throw it over the
opponents, whose duty it is to catch it and return it, until
one side drives the other back over their goal line." In
the following he can see hand-ball: "It consists of making
a ball bound off the ground, and sending it against a wall,
counting the number of the hops according as it was returned."
From another writer he finds lacrosse: "Certain
youths, divided equally, leave in a level place, which they
have before prepared and measured, a ball made of leather,
about the size of an apple, and rush at it, as if it were a
prize lying in the middle, from their fixed starting-point (a
goal). Each of them has in his right hand a racket of suitable
length ending in a sort of flat bend, the middle of which
is occupied by gut strings, dried by seasoning, and plaited
together in net fashion. Each strives to be the first to bring
it to the opposite end of the ground from that allotted to
them. Whenever the ball is driven by the rackets to the end
of the ground, it counts a victory."171


Sports and Festivals. Besides the games and plays for the
younger people noted above, there was plenty of amusement
of youths and adults in the way of sports and festivals. The
gymnasium, with its palæstra, and the festivals gave opportunity
for exercises and displays of all kinds.

The most common forms of gymnastic exercises were running,
jumping, throwing the discus, hurling the javelin, and
wrestling, and they formed what was known as the pentathlon.
They were engaged in at the gymnasium and at the
four great national festivals. Beside these there were boxing,
the pancration, which consisted of boxing and wrestling, horse
racing, and chariot racing.

The gymnasium was originally an athletic ground where
all kinds of sports were carried on and it contained the palæstra,
which was essentially a building for the purposes of
wrestling, although both palæstra and gymnasium came later
to stand for other things beside.

There were four great national festivals, known as the
Olympian, the Pythian, the Nemean, and the Isthmian. In
these festivals contests in races and athletic exercises were
held and also sometimes in music, poetry, rhetoric, and the
like. The Olympic festival was held at Olympia every four[Pg 198]
years, in the summer, and lasted for five days; the Pythian
festival was also held every four years, near Delphi, in the
winter, in the third year of every Olympiad; the Nemean
festival was held at Nemea in the second and fourth year of
every Olympiad, alternating in winter and in summer; and
the Isthmian festival was held at Corinth, in the first and
third years of each Olympiad, alternating between spring
and summer. These times were thus arranged so that these
national festivals did not conflict with one another.

The Olympic festival was the most noted. It was so important
that in case of war a truce was entered into among
the Grecian states, which lasted probably for three months
during the year of the festival. During this time all people
journeying to and from the festival were granted protection,
and no one was allowed to carry arms within the sacred territory.
The official prize was but a crown of wild olive, not
valuable in itself, but it was perhaps the most coveted honor
in all Greece. Only Greeks were eligible to compete and the
winner received the highest honor from his fellow-townspeople.
Poets of high renown composed odes in his honor, bronze
statues were made of him, he rode home in a triumphal
chariot and sometimes a part of the wall of his town was torn
down for his entry, he was generally supported for the remainder
of his life at public expense, and his honor extended
to his parents and to his children, and even to the city of
his birth.

Women were not allowed to be present at the Olympian
games. The only exception was in permitting the priestesses
of Demeter to be present, who remained in a temple built for
them near the Stadium. All other women were excluded from
the territory for a certain number of days. The penalty of
trespassing on the part of a woman was death, the transgressor
being thrown from the Typæan rock. "Only one instance
is recorded of this rule being broken. Pherenice, a
member of the famous family of the Diagoridæ, in her anxiety
to see her son Peisirodus compete in the boys' boxing, accompanied
him to Olympia disguised as a trainer. In her
delight at his victory she leapt over the barrier and so disclosed
her sex. The Hellanodicæ, however, pardoned her in
consideration for her father and brothers and son, all of them
Olympic victors, but they passed a decree that henceforth
all trainers should appear naked."172 But women were per[Pg 199]mitted
to enter their horses for the chariot-race, which they
did, and won some races, too. The women had their own
festival at Olympia, the Heræa, occurring every four years,
at which there were races for maidens of various years, the
course being one-sixth less than that for men.

Every Greek boy received a thorough physical training.
To keep up the spirit for such training, local festivals were
held in which was given opportunity for the boys' testing
their strength and skill. In the 37th Olympiad were first
introduced contests for boys, the names of the victors being
inscribed on the records of the events before the names of the
adult victors. At first there were only two classes of competition,
for boys and for men, later a third class being added,
for the beardless or those between boys and men. It would
appear as if the ages for boys was between twelve and sixteen
and for the beardless between sixteen and twenty. The
length of the race-course for boys was but half that for adults
and for the beardless it was two-thirds the full length. In
the races at the Olympic Heræa the girls were likewise divided
into the three ages. In the second century before
Christ was introduced the pancration for boys, which shows
that the games were becoming more cruel and degraded.


Other Amusements. The Greeks of the olden times were
much given to entertainments. These might be at the home
or on the sea-shore or in the country. They might be given
by an individual, or gotten up by parties, each one contributing
his part or sharing in the expense. It was not uncommon
to have excursions into the country or to the sea-shore, with
food and drink packed and taken along for the occasion.

The entertainments in the home were sometimes simply
an informal affair, while again they were quite formal. A
man wishing to give an entertainment would go out to the
market-place or the gymnasium and invite his friends or he
might send the invitations by a slave. After entrance into
the home and the exchange of greetings, the meal was partaken
of and the drinking was entered upon. Toasts were
drank to one another and to absent ones, the young men
taking the occasion to drink to their loved ones and to sing
love-songs. Conversation would be entered upon and jokes
and puns made, professional jesters being quite often hired
for the evening. There would be games and conundrums
and riddles and enigmas. A favorite game for such an evening
was called kottabos, in which the player would throw[Pg 200]
the last drops of wine in his cup on to the head of a small
brazen figure, which produced a clanging sound and a bobbing
of the head; the louder the clang and the more violent
the bobbing with the smaller the amount of the wine thrown,
the greater the success of the player. There were dancing-girls
and flute players and jugglers and contortionists. Recitations
of passages from the poets were given and there were
pantomimic and dramatic scenes acted. There might have
been little of the kind of entertaining as noted above and the
evening spent in deep conversation upon the important topics
of the day and by the great philosophers and poets and dramatists
and the other great men gathered on the occasion.

One of the very greatest amusements of the Greeks was
that of the theater. These were usually built along a hillside,
the seats being cut into the solid rock. The performances
were held in connection with two of the leading religious
festivals, the one in the midwinter and the other in the
spring. The theaters were public and open to all the citizens
and free of expense, the expenses being borne by the state or
by wealthy citizens. There were no playbills nor similar kind
of announcements of the plays, usually the audience not
knowing what was to come till the play opened.

Dancing and music were among the pleasures of the young
people. Of these were mimetic dances, representing mythological
scenes. There were also warlike and choral dances
performed at the feasts of the gods. There were professional
dancers and singers and flute-players. There were a
number of kinds of musical instruments. The types of the
stringed instruments were represented by the lyre, the kithara,
and the harp; the wind-instruments were the pipes, clarionets,
and trumpets; and the clanging instruments were the
castanets, cymbal, and tambourine.

The young men indulged in horse-racing; they frequented
gambling places where dice was used; and they placed metal
spurs on cocks, pheasants, and quails and fought them thus
armed. Hunting was a favorite sport. It was quite fashionable
for rich young men to have fine horses and, although
they did ride some, yet they preferred to drive their horses
to chariots.

The jugglers and acrobats were quite skilful and they were
of both sexes. Outside the help of present day science, they
seemed to have performed as remarkable feats as at the present[Pg 201]
time. They gave sword dances; they tossed hoops and balls;
they did rope-walking and dancing; they extracted things
from their eyes and ears and noses and mouths. They would
stand on their hands and head and perform feats with their
toes, as filling vessels with water and shooting bows and arrows.
In one feat a woman acrobat would bend back her
head till it met her heels, then she would clasp her feet with
her hands and roll off like a hoop. In one exhibit there was
a contrivance, known as the potter's wheel, in which a young
woman would be whirled round rapidly and yet she managed
to read and write while being so twirled.


Sickness and Death. In the earlier times of Greece old
age was highly respected in all the states. In Sparta and
Thebes this respect was maintained, but among the smart set
in Athens this was not the case. In the more remote and
primitive districts the aged enjoyed the reverence and affection
of the young and middle-aged alike. They were
treated with great respect in both public and private and
their opinions were sought for in affairs of state and of the
home. Yet in all Greece there was a desire for children so
that parents might be protected and comforted in advancing
age, and those without children were often in a pitiable condition
in extreme old age. At the age of sixty a man was
recognized to be at least physically old, as he was then exempt
from military duty.

Although the Greeks enjoyed an exceptionally fine climate
and gave especial care to the body, yet they were subject
to diseases as other people. Their houses were not in sanitary
conditions, the streets were not in proper order, and the water
was not always pure. There were physicians who had quite
good skill in the treatment of diseases and both medicine and
surgery were in a fair condition, although superstition and
folk-lore too often ruled. Athens and other cities employed
physicians at public cost to care for the poor free of charge.

Burial of the dead was a very important function and one
demanded by both custom and religion. Without this final
honor, it was thought the spirit would wander restlessly on
forever. So when a man died his family was bound to give
him proper burial. This was considered so important that
when a man died in a foreign land his body was brought home,
or, if that was impossible, then a tomb was erected to him
and the burial rites enacted. It was even considered dis[Pg 202]graceful
not to let enemies in war bury their dead and after
battles a truce was entered upon that the dead might be
buried.

When dead the body was washed and anointed and clothed
in white and placed on a couch. A wreath was placed on the
head and garlands about the body, which were given by
friends. On the floor about the couch were set pitchers that
were to be put into the grave or on the funeral pile. The
burial took place early in the morning, at Athens, at least, before
sunrise. In the earlier times the dead were buried in the
houses, but later they were placed outside the cities, usually
along a road, but in Sparta they were kept in the city, while in
the country they were buried in the fields. The bodies either
were buried or cremated, but as the latter was quite expensive
it was used usually by the wealthy only.

In the funeral procession the body was carried in a vehicle
or on the shoulders of friends or slaves. The male mourners
marched in front of the corpse and the female mourners behind
it, all dressed in black with the hair cut short. In the
Homeric times there were violent outbursts of grief and abuse
of person by the mourners, but in later times laws were
passed to prevent such. At the grave if the body was to be
burnt it was placed upon the pile and precious ointments and
perfumes were poured over it while burning and the ashes
were collected and placed in an urn. If it was to be interred,
the body was placed in a wooden, earthenware, or metallic
coffin and put into the grave, which was usually in the rock.
The mourners then returned to the house and partook of the
funeral meal. On the third and tenth days sacrifices were
offered at the tomb and again on the thirtieth day, which
concluded the mourning period. The graves were well cared
for and decorated with flowers and plants. "To neglect the
tomb of your ancestors was so far a crime that no man could
become a chief officer of the state who could be proved to
have failed in this respect."173


Religion. "An Athenian child begins by listening to the
'old wives' tales' of his nurse; then is present at domestic
rites and sacrifices, which impress him without his understanding
them; afterwards learns his old-fashioned Homer
and his poets, before he has any notion of questioning their
theology; next moves about among altars and splendid temples
and statues of Zeus, Athena, Dionysus, and many an[Pg 203]other
divinity; is later on initiated into awesome mysteries,
which are addressed to his emotions and not to his reason;
and is at all times trained to undertake no enterprise, public
or private, without first consulting the will of the gods, praying
to them, and sacrificing to them."174

The child was introduced into the religious life in the
home, as each house had its own altar and its special household
deities, to whom prayers were offered and sacrifices made,
and on occasions of marriage, birth, death, and the like, special
ceremonies occurred. He learned about both the good
and the bad, as amulets were hung about his neck to ward
off harm and he saw sacrifices made to appease the wrath of
the evil ones. In public there were sacrifices and celebrations
to the gods, in some of which the child took part.

Old Greek religion was a worship of the beautiful       the
ideal in nature and human life, and the gods were ideal expressions
of human thought, portraying the divine in man.
Religion influenced the old Greek in every way and on every
side he was reminded of the gods by temples, altars, statues,
sacred trees, etc. But with all his religion, strange to say,
the Greek did not connect it closely with his moral life, for
his religion was expressed in his attitude toward the gods,
while his morality was determined by the laws of the land
and the customs of society. This is well shown in his prayers,
for these were not offered for inward betterment, but for
some definite outward help.


Education. In the early times of Greece there were no
real schools, the young receiving their training from the life
of the family and the community. As this came through contact
with living persons and not through dead precepts in
sacred books, which demanded strict obedience and following,
there was opportunity for growth so that progress might
be made by the individual away from fixed and stereotyped
ways of doing things. The purpose of the training of those
times was to help the boy to become a man who would be
wise and eloquent in council and strong and courageous in
battle.

Sparta represented a phase of education in Greece. Surrounded
as it was by people who were hostile to its ways and
customs, it was necessary that the young should be trained
to be patriotic to the state and skilled in war. To this end
education began before birth, for means were used for having[Pg 204]
strong children born and those not strong at birth were cast
aside from the state. If the child at birth was decided by
the council to be fit to grow up to be a Spartan, then he was
given to his mother and remained with her till his seventh
year, when he was taken from her and put under the care
and training of state officials.

When at seven years of age the boy was taken over by
the state, he was placed in the care of an officer called the
paedonomus. This officer had supreme power over all the
boys and youth and superintended their moral training and
gymnastic exercises and their punishments, having men to
assist in the work.

All the education was at public cost and all the young
were placed in public buildings, eating and sleeping in common,
all being placed together in common, even the younger
members of the royal family, the heir-apparent to the throne
being alone exempt. Here they were divided into three companies
according to age       from the seventh to the twelfth
year, from the twelfth to the fifteenth, from the fifteenth to
the eighteenth. The elder and stronger boys were placed
over them as, captains and had them in charge.

When the boy first entered with the others his hair was
cut short. The life was one of continued severe discipline
and hardship. In summer and winter they went without
shoes and with but little clothing, after the twelfth year
with only one garment. They slept on pallets of straw without
covering and after fifteen their beds consisted of rushes
collected by themselves without the use of a knife. They were
given but little food. They had permission to steal other
food, but if caught stealing they were considered disgraced
and received a severe flogging.

The training of the boys consisted in gymnastic exercises,
being carefully organized and graded. The younger boys
were drilled in running and leaping and ball-playing. The
older boys engaged in wrestling, boxing, throwing the discus,
and hurling the javelin. Sometimes the pancratium was used,
consisting of boxing and wrestling and also most anything to
win, as biting, kicking, scratching, gouging. The contestants
generally were naked. Dancing supplemented the gymnastics,
which for the most part were war-dances and also
some choral dancing was given to be used in religious festivals.
This was all done to prepare the young for warfare.

When a boy reached eighteen years of age, he then left[Pg 205]
the buildings for boys and entered upon a more distinctive
study of warfare. He was permitted to let his hair and
beard grow and was known as a melleiren, "budding youth."
These youths were drilled in the use of arms and in skirmishing.
They were given frequent strict examinations. To test
their courage and endurance, there was a custom of each
year of whipping a certain number of youth. They were
placed at the altar of Artemis Orthia and so severely whipped
as to cause the blood to stream from them, their fathers and
mothers standing by and urging them to endure it without
flinching or murmuring. Sometimes they endured till they
died under the severity of the whipping. Also there was
another test in the way of a battle of the melleirenes, held
each year on a small island near Sparta. These youths were
divided into two companies, sacrifices to the gods were made,
they were lined up against one another, and then commanded
to fight. They fought without weapons, but fists and teeth
and body and limbs were most fiercely used, and many were
the wounds received.

At twenty years of age, the budding youth became known
as an eiren, "a youth." These remained youths for the next
ten years and they lived in barracks to themselves. They
took a public oath of loyalty to Sparta and entered the army,
thus going into real military life. They entered upon the
life of a soldier, lived upon the coarsest fare, were drilled
in the usages of warfare, and were sent out to guard and
care for some armed camps or fortresses on the border. Each
year there were festivals in which was displayed by all the
youth their skill in military drill and gymnastic exercises
and in music and dancing, such exhibits being before the
king and the officers and the public.

At thirty years of age, the Spartan was recognized as
being a full-grown man and became a member of the public
assembly and was required to marry. But even then he had
to remain with the youths and boys and eat at the common
table with them, so that he had no home and had to visit his
wife secretly in her home. He also continued in military
service. It was the custom for each man to select a boy or
a youth as a companion and to look after his care and training.
These men were expected to be examples to the boys
and youths and to correct them in their faults, the men
being punished upon failure to do these things.

The girls of Sparta received a public training similar to[Pg 206]
that of the boys. It was the aim to train them so as to become
strong, healthy women, such as could bear robust sons
to the state. They were given gymnastic exercises such as
were given to the boys, but not in company with the boys,
and also the girls were permitted to remain at home. They
were exercised in running, wrestling, leaping, throwing the
discus, hurling the javelin, and in dancing and music. On
some occasions the young men and young women danced and
sang together in public in festivals to the gods. This training
did produce strong women and who were as patriotic as
the men and who as mothers could give thanks to the gods in
the temples when they learned that husbands and sons had
died fighting for their country.

It may be seen that Spartan education was public and free
and open equally to all free-born children. The Spartan
youth received very little intellectual training. No doubt
some acquired reading and writing, as such was not forbidden,
although not encouraged. They obtained ethical and
intellectual training from listening to their elders at meals
and on the street. They gained from criticism of their conduct,
which criticism was severe at all times. Thus they
learned reverence for elders, honesty, and self-respect. All
the sufferings and hardships placed upon the youth were that
they might receive training to make them good soldiers to go
out to battle for their native land. Although Spartan education
did produce warriors and patriots, yet it did not bring
out individuality, that which makes most for true progress
and right living. "The state regulated the individual life,
and, by so doing, crushed out individuality, personal initiation,
literary and scientific activity, and ethical freedom."175

Athens represented another phase in Greek education. A
new conception of human life developed here and hence there
came forth new ideas in regard to the meaning and end of
education. The idea of the significance of the individual
took prominence and, although interests centered upon the
state, yet the state was considered as being composed, of individuals,
each of whose free development made the voluntary
giving of his life to the state all the stronger and better
state. The citizens of Athens were educated for peace
as well as for war, so that the aim of education was to produce
all-round men who by being trained to be individuals
would thus make the best citizens.[Pg 207]

At birth the child at Athens was judged by the father
and upon his decision it remained in the family or it was
taken from the mother and exposed. If it was returned to
the mother, whether a boy or a girl, it remained in the
home till marriage, when the man or woman went to his or
her own home. For the first seven years of the child's life,
both boy and girl, he was under the care and training of the
mother and the other women of the household. The Athenian
boy was well cared for and given plenty to eat and to wear
and toys and playthings, so that at least the early years of
his life were easy and pleasant. By hearing the nursery-rhymes
and the stories from folk-lore, and by having related
to him the doings of the gods and god-like men as
given in the writings of the times, his emotional nature was
stimulated and he became imbued with the poetic feeling
and dramatic spirit which invaded Athens and with which
later he was to come in close contact through his school
training and in his social and political life.

When the boy became seven years of age, he was sent to
school. He was then placed under the charge of a male
slave, known as a pedagogue, whose duty it was to go back
and forth to school with the boy and carry his things and
to have care of the boy's manners and morals, having the
power of discipline, but he did not impart instruction, that
being given by the grammatist (elementary teacher) and the
pedotribe (gymnastic teacher). The state did not provide
elementary schools, although they were under its supervision.
The schools were not only private, but the father had the
right to decide what work should be given to his boy, and
yet the law did prescribe instruction in gymnastics and
music. If the father did not give due education to his sons,
in his old age he could not claim support from them. The
length of stay in the school and the amount of education
obtained depended upon the will and condition of the father,
but all the boys did receive elementary instruction in reading,
writing, and arithmetic. The physical training consisted
in ball-playing, running, leaping, throwing the discus,
hurling the javelin, and wrestling, the course being graded
to the age and size of the boys. They were also taught
dancing and music. Their education was to train the boy to
be able to use his body with ease and grace and to increase
his intelligence rather than to train him solely to become a
soldier.[Pg 208]

At fifteen years of age the boy passed out of the elementary
training and from the control of the pedagogue, and
if of the higher classes he entered upon higher training.
He now left the private school and entered the public school,
the gymnasium, which was not more than an exercising
ground located in a grove just outside Athens. At this time
the youth was given much more liberty than when a boy, as
now he was allowed to go wherever he wished, that he might
become acquainted with what was going on in the city to prepare
him for the duties of public life. He was still under
the care of his father or guardian and through him he
had opportunity for meeting men and hearing the conversations
and discussions and thus learn of the political life
of the state and the moral obligations of a citizen. At this
time the youth began to learn to play a musical instrument
and he read and recited poetry and studied drawing and
geometry and grammar. The gymnastic training received
much more attention at this period than the literary, as
beauty of person and health was the great aim. The exercises
were about the same as in the previous period but of
a more strenuous nature. Boxing was introduced now and
sometimes the pancratium was used. Hunting and swimming
became a part of the life of the youth.

At eighteen the young man completed the second period
of public training and became known as an ephebus, "youth,"
His father or guardian presented him for citizenship, and
if he showed proper credentials of legitimate birth, of Athenian
parentage, up to standard in body, mind, and morals,
he was registered. He also took an oath of fidelity to the
state. He then entered into military service and continued
for two years. He was thoroughly drilled and then sent to
the frontier. At the close of this second year, when he was
twenty years of age, he was called to Athens and examined
for citizenship, and if he made a proper showing he was
then made a full citizen, with all the privileges and duties
pertaining to that office.

The pedagogue was not held in high esteem, as he was
usually a slave that was unable to work, being too old or
crippled. The elementary teacher, too, did not take a high,
position, as there were no special qualifications, so that any
one could fill the position and usually only those entered
into this work who were unfitted or unprepared for other occupations,
and too often as the last resort. The elementary[Pg 209]
schools were sometimes carried on in a portico or the sheltered
corner of a street, but again there were good buildings
and well-equipped for the times. The furniture of these
buildings usually consisted of stools for the children and a
seat with a back for the teacher. The Athenian boy left
home at daybreak for school and he did not get back home
till sunset, but this was somewhat offset by the frequent
closing of the school for holidays and festivals. The discipline
was quite severe, the stick and the strap being much
in evidence, and yet the teachers of ancient Greece do not
appear to have been more cruel than those of Europe and of
the earlier days in America.

In reading, the child was first taught his letters and their
sounds, next came the learning of syllables, and this was
followed by the learning of words, and the learning of the
sentence came at the last. After he had learned to read, the
boy was given Homer and other Greek writers. The teacher
would recite the selection and the pupil would then repeat
it. The poems were carefully explained to the children and
questions asked them after such explanation.

Paper made from the bark of the papyrus-plant and parchment
were used for writing on. To write on the paper and
parchment reeds, split and pointed-like pens were used.
Both black and red ink were used in the writing. Such were
not used by the school-boy, as he had wax tablets, which
were made by covering a small, thin board with a layer of
wax. The boy used an ivory or metal pencil for writing
on the tablet. One end of the pencil was made pointed for
this purpose and the other end was flattened so that the
pupil could smooth over the wax when the tablet was to be
used again. The teacher would write letters and words,
which the boys copied. At times he would guide the hand
of a beginner. Also sometimes the copies were made deep
in the wax and the children would trace them.

There was no such thing as school education of girls and
young women in Athens, no public training whatever. The
Athenians held that woman's place was in the home and that
she should not take part in public life. Hence, according to
their ideas, the girl needed no education beyond what would
be required for the life within doors, such as would fit her
to perform what they considered the simple duties that would
come to her as wife and mother. The education of the girl,
therefore, fell solely to the mother, aided by the other women[Pg 210]
of the household. The girl was taught to sew, spin, knit,
weave, etc., and sometimes she learned to read and to write
and to play on the lyre and sing. It is true there were
women at Athens who were educated, and some of them were
most highly learned, but they were not citizens of Athens,
being foreigners and known as the hetairai. These women
were discussed in a previous section of this chapter, so there
is no need of further statements here.

Education in Sparta and in Athens comprehended in a
general way much the same, as gymnastic and music were
the two basic elements. The gymnastic education consisted
not only in the exercising of the muscles, but also in the
training for endurance to fit the young men for the fatiguing
duties of the life of a soldier. Also music was broadened to
include literary and moral training as well as music in its
narrower sense. If the Spartan education did crush out
much of individuality with the men, yet it did allow advantages
to its women as no other education, in that the
public training of the girls and the taking part in public
affairs by the women gave to them great opportunities for
growth. If the Athenian education did allow individual
expression to the men, yet in confining the women to the
narrow place of the home at Athens and in not allowing
them to have any part in public education and public life,
it narrowed the life of the woman in Athens more than was
narrowed the life of the man in Sparta. There are things
to praise and things to condemn in the education of Athens
as well as that of Sparta.

CHAPTER X

THE CHILD IN ROME



Characteristics. It is one of the world problems to determine
just the cause for the origin and building up of a great
city from which arose a great nation as Rome. This is one
of the great puzzling questions that seems can never be correctly
answered. But whatever the cause of the origin of
the Romans, there is no question about their accomplishments.
From a few mud huts on the bank of the Tiber river
filled with savage or semi-civilized people there grew up one
of the very greatest ruling forces the world has ever known,
conquering the known world and controlling all from the
center at Rome with power and wisdom that seem miraculous.
The Romans possessed intense personality and keen power of
organization and control. They believed in the state and that
each individual owed it a duty, and yet they conceived that
the state existed for the individual and needed each one as
well as the individual needed the state. This view of the
state and the individual enabled the Romans to base the state
on law and to respect law when once established. Through
this view they became lovers of law and order. They were
essentially practical and from their attacking the problems
of the world in a business and thoughtful way they became
strong in administrative ability and through which they
evolved a sound jurisprudence, which was bequeathed to humanity.
The old Romans were men of both moral and physical
vigor and of strong thought; they were utilitarian, proud,
overbearing, selfish, cruel, and rapacious; with strong self-will
they met humanity and nature and conquered both, which
is shown on nature by remains of roads, bridges, aqueducts,
and other structures, while their language yet dominates a
large part of the world and their laws a yet still larger
portion.

"Rome was one continual city of noise and bustle. Horace
had complained of the turmoil going on night and day, the
scurry and crowding of the streets from whose 'torrents and[Pg 213]
tempests' he hastened to escape into the chaste solitude of
the Sabine hills. But during the first century population
and activity increased apace, reaching its zenith, perhaps, in
the days of Martial and Juvenal. Before daybreak the bakers
would be hawking their loaves, and the shepherds, coming into
the town from the surrounding districts, their milk: then
the infant schools would begin intoning the alphabet, and
with hammer and saw the rasping workshops were set going.
Creaking wagons would haul huge blocks of stone and trunks
of trees, with the weight of which the ground would quake,
heavily laden beasts of burden jostled the foot-passenger;
on all sides jolting and knocks and trampling, a fine confusion
in which pickpockets reap their advantage. Here,
says Martial (100 A.      D.), the money-changer clatters Nero's
bad coin down on his dirty table, and there a workman is
hammering Spanish gold on an anvil. A procession of raving
priests of Bellona is shrieking uninterruptedly; a shipwrecked
sailor, with a fragment of the wreck wrapped up
in his hand, is begging alms; a Jewish lad, sent out by his
mother to beg; the call of a blear-eyed peddler from the other
side of the Tiber, offering sulphur matches for broken glass.
Jugglers, some with trained animals (Juvenal speaks of a
monkey riding a goat and swinging a spear), Marsian snake-eaters
and snake-charmers are calling for spectators for their
craft. Peddlers, peddling old clothes, linen and what-not, carriers
of pea-flour and smoking sausages, butchers with a
reeking quarter of beef, and the foot, the guts and the blood-red
lung,       each, to his own screeching tune, proclaiming his
own wares."176


The People. In early Rome the population was divided
into three classes, as in Greece, which comprised citizens with
full rights and privileges, aliens with no rights of their
own, and slaves who were regarded as mere property. But
Rome, unlike Greece, did not remain a small territory, but
extended its realm to include the parts of Italy about it and
then all Italy and then the land about the Mediterranean,
and then expanded to other parts of the earth, making a vast
territory. Roman citizenship was gradually extended till it
reached out into this territory. So the original three divisions
did not continue to be maintained closely but there
grew up three other divisions of the people. These were the
patricians, the equites, and the plebeians, all of whom were[Pg 214]
of the free population, enjoying the citizenship of Rome
but not having the same privileges. The patricians, or ordo
senatorius, were of the governing class; the equites, or ordo
equester, included the middle class, the business people such
as bankers, merchants, contractors, and the like; the plebeians
included the great body of citizens, the common people.


Slavery. The greatest development of slavery was at Rome,
reaching its high point in the last century of the Republic.
The Romans had slaves from the earliest history. In the
early times those who held slaves usually did not have more
than two or three each, but as the years went on civic conditions
changed and a great demand for slaves arose and the
numbers increased till in the time of Augustus it is estimated
that the whole number of free citizens in Rome might
have been a half million or more and the slave population
half that number, one in every three of the population of
Rome at that time being a slave.177

The slaves came from the children of slaves, from persons
becoming slaves under the law of debt, from importations
from other slave-holding countries, from kidnappers who
snatched up people from other countries and even from the
coasts of Italy, but the great source of all was from captives
in the numerous wars waged by Rome upon other peoples.
It is claimed that in one campaign there were 150,000 people
sold into slavery at its close. Slave-dealers followed the
armies and there were slave-markets at Rome and other cities.
Slaves were sold in open market just as animals and at high-tide
prices were very low. There were all kinds of slaves,
as they came from many parts of Africa, Asia, and Europe.
The greatest number were used in agriculture and in domestic
service. There were all kinds of mechanics among
the slaves and some most highly skilled. There were educated
slaves coming from Greece and other countries of the
East, so that they were used for the training of the young
and for the carrying on of business for their masters. There
even were physicians and surgeons among the slaves, many
households having one to look after the needs of the free and
the slave. There also were slaves whose duty it was to give
amusement and entertainment, such as musicians, dancers,
acrobats, jugglers, rope-walkers, and the like. Too, there were
poor dwarfs and simple-minded among the slaves, who were[Pg 215]
used to amuse master and mistress and guests as did the
jesters of the courts in Europe later.

In the early times when each family had but few slaves,
they were well treated and well cared for, being considered
as members of the household. But later, and especially when
slaves became so numerous and cheap, they were often treated
very badly and neglected. The slaves were the absolute
property of the masters and unprotected by the law, but
later laws were made for their protection. The punishments
were often extremely severe. They were brutally beaten,
legs fettered, heavy iron collars put around their necks,
thrown into dungeons, put at hard labor till worn out. Their
capital punishment was crucifixion, being thrown to the animals
of the vivarium, or set to fight the fierce beasts in the
amphitheater. They were not always treated badly and even
some became greatly esteemed by master and mistress and
sometimes master and slave became friends, as some slaves
were highly educated and accomplished men. Such slaves
were usually set free and thus became freemen.

It is not necessary to discuss here the effect of slavery
upon the citizen or the nation, for the world has fully decided
that slavery is not good for the slave nor for the master
nor for the state.


The Home. "The oldest Italian dwelling was a mere wigwam,
with a hearth in the middle of the floor and a hole at
the top to let the smoke out."178 As Rome kept growing the
houses kept improving until within the city the buildings
became among the most wonderful and beautiful in the world.
Also the Romans built beautiful country residences, villas,
out from Rome. Little was known about the houses of the
Romans until Pompeii and other cities were discovered in the
middle of the eighteenth century, having been buried by an
eruption of Vesuvius in 79 A.      D. The houses and contents
in Pompeii were well preserved, as the city was covered
with ashes, while the other places were more or less destroyed
by streams of lava.

When Rome became so filled with people, only the wealthy
were able to have houses of their own, the well-to-do and the
poor had to find place in huge lodging-houses called insulae
(islands), because they occupied the entire block and so
were surrounded by streets. Before the great fire in the
time of Nero, the streets were irregular and narrow. In the[Pg 216]
earlier times of the Republic the houses were three or four
stories high and the number of stories grew until the time of
Augustus, the maximum height of the frontage of a private
building was made 70 feet (Roman measure), which gave room
for six or seven stories which height was reduced after the
fire of Nero to 60 feet, five or six stories. These houses were
erected by speculators and were of poor material and poorly
constructed, so that they were continually crumbling and
tumbling and burning down. Being cheaply constructed and
poorly repaired they did not afford great protection against
the weather and so it was fortunate for the poor people that the
climate of Italy for the most part favored an out-of-door life.

There were three parts in a Roman house, which were arranged
in the same order in almost every house, although
there might have been other rooms attached to them. In
front was the atrium, partly covered; then came a center
space, the tablinum, which was entirely covered; and adjoining
this latter was the peristylium, an open court surrounded
by columns.

The atrium was the essential feature that marked off the
Roman house from that of Greece and other countries of the
East. In the primitive houses, and in later times with the
poor and the middle classes, this was used for both kitchen
and sitting-room, while with the wealthier people it was the
reception-room. This contained the family hearth and altar.
The street door did not open directly from the street but there
was a passage from the street and the door was placed at the
end of this passage. Usually there was a square opening in
the roof of the atrium for light and in the floor underneath
this opening was a cistern for receiving the water that rained
in and there were pipes under the floor for carrying off the
water.

The tablinum was usually separated from the atrium by
curtains. This contained the family records and archives; the
peristylium was a later addition to the Roman house, coming
when Greek architecture became to be used in the buildings.
This became the ornamental part of the house, with fountains
and flowers and shrubbery occupying the center of the court,
surrounded by pillars and open to the sky. There were other
rooms, among them being the alae, small rooms at the right
and left of the atrium, and from the peristylium opened the
triclinium, dining room, the culina, kitchen, and the sacrarium,
chapel.[Pg 217]

The street door was of wood, having two leaves (a folding-door),
moving on pivots, and in private houses opening inward
and outward in public buildings. When opening inward
the door was secured by a bolt and when opening outward
by lock and key. There were but few windows and in general
only in rooms above the ground floor. Paper, linen
cloth, horn, and mica were used in the windows and glass
seems to have come into use under the early emperors.
The walls were decorated with paintings. The floors of the
primitive houses consisted of clay and then came bricks and
tiles and stones and later the houses of the wealthy class had
marble and mosaics.

"The Romans resorted to various methods of warming their
rooms. They made use of portable furnaces for carrying
embers and burning coals to warm the different apartments
of the house, and which they seem to have placed in the
middle of the room. They also had a method of heating the
rooms by hot air, which was conveyed by means of pipes
through the different apartments. They also had a kind of
stove, in which wood appears to have been usually burned. It
has been a matter of much dispute whether the Romans had
chimneys to carry off the smoke, but it does not appear that
these were entirely unknown to the Romans."179

There were four representative kinds of chairs used by the
Romans. The first kind was a folding-stool with curved legs
placed crosswise; the second kind had four perpendicular
legs and were without backs; the third kind were similar to
the second but had a back; and the fourth kind was a chair of
state, with high or low back, the back and legs being ornamented.

The couches were of three kinds. There was the low dining-couch,
upon which they reclined at meals; then there were
the beds for sleep at night or siesta by day; and the third
kind had usually two arms but no back and which were chiefly
used for reading or writing at night. With the bed was the
mattress, filled with straw or sheep's wool or the down of
geese and swans; bolsters and cushions, stuffed as the mattress;
blankets and sheets, of simple material or dyed and embroidered;
pillows for propping the head or the left elbow of
the sleeping or reclining persons; and footstools.

They had benches of wood and stone and bronze, some of
them being semi-circular and large enough to hold quite a[Pg 218]
number of people. There were square, round, and crescent-shaped
tables, some being quite large, others smaller with
three legs, and a one-legged table, often quite small and made
of the rarest material and elegant in design. There were pots
and pans of various kinds, and buckets and dishes and drinking-vessels,
and other kinds of vessels.

The houses at night were lighted with lamps. The lamp
consisted of the oil-reservoir, which contained the oil, the
nose, through which went the wick, and the handle to carry it
by. The lamps were put on stands or were suspended from
lamp-holders or they hung down from the ceiling. The stands
and lamp-holders that were used by the poorer people were
made of common wood or metal, while those of the rich were
of costly material and often most beautifully adorned with
figures of all kinds of animals carved upon them. They had
lanterns also, which had for covering horn, oiled canvas, and
bladder, and later, glass.


Women. There were three classes of women at Rome       the
citizen-woman, the alien, and the slave. Unlike as in Athens,
the foreign woman never rose to prominence at Rome but it
was the citizen-woman who took rank always before any
other. Nor was a male citizen allowed to marry an alien
woman, for citizens were wanted and, therefore, both parents
needed to be citizens. But as citizenship was expanded to the
parts of the world outside of Rome, the alien woman became a
citizen, and so a Roman could marry her and still maintain his
own and his offspring's rights.

In the early times the woman remained at home. She engaged
in spinning and weaving and other household duties,
and she had supreme control of household affairs. She was
under the authority of her husband and she had no individual
rights in property and she could not make a will. Later she
acquired more rights and privileges. The condition of
women at Rome was quite a deal better than at Athens or in
any other country previous to Roman times. For at Rome
women were allowed more freedom and participation in
public affairs, they were allowed more to share in the joys and
pleasures of the husband and other people, and they enjoyed
a greater confidence and esteem of the men.

That Roman women appeared in public and that they were
not afraid to stand up for their rights is illustrated in the
following. In 215 B.      C., when Rome needed resources for the
second Punic war, the Oppian Law, was passed which forbade[Pg 219]
any woman to have gold trinkets of the weight of more than
half an ounce, to wear a parti-colored garment, or to ride in
a chariot within the city of Rome or a town occupied by
Roman citizens or within a mile of these places, except for a
religious purpose. Twenty years later, when the war was
over and prosperity had returned, the women asked for the
repeal of this law. They started a campaign and talked about
it in every place, they interviewed men on the street, and
they stated the case to every one that had a vote. Women
from towns and villages came into Rome to help. On the
day of the vote, the women rose early and filled the streets to
the Forum and used every means to gain their cause. They
finally overcame the opposition, the law was repealed, and the
women recovered their liberty of riding and dressing as they
had formerly done.

The Roman women would even go to greater extremes than
the conducting of a political campaign. Over a hundred years
before the event recorded above, when the women had much
less privileges, when the despotic actions of husbands became
unendurable, the women sought a way of rescuing themselves.
At the time a number of men of the upper classes were attacked
by an unknown disease, in every case attended by similar
symptoms, and nearly all died. No cause could be found
until a female slave offered to explain upon promise of freedom
and to suffer no harm in consequence. Upon the Senate's
guaranteeing such to her, she told them that the deaths were
from poison, that the wives met together to compound the
poison. She took the officials to the place, where they found
the women preparing the ingredients. The women were
charged with the matter, and to prove their innocence they
partook of the drugs, upon which death followed, and with
the same symptoms as with the men. Upon investigation 170
of the women were found guilty and it is held that 300 or
more wives had entered into the plot to put their husbands to
death. Some doubts are thrown upon this story by some historians
but at any rate it is stated that the Romans believed
it and told it for the truth.

Another story is told of women's appearing in public. At
the time of the second triumvirate, funds being needed, a decree
was passed requiring that fourteen hundred of the richest
women should make a valuation of their property, under
severe penalties against concealment or undervaluation, and
that they should turn over such a portion as the triumvirs[Pg 220]
might require. The women appealed to the sister of one of
the triumvirs and to the mother and wife of another but with
little success. They then in a body went to the tribunal of
the triumvirs, whose acts no man dared question, making for
their spokesman, Hortensia, the daughter of the famous
orator, Hortensius, and protested against the edict. It is
claimed this is the first time to be enunciated the principle of
"no taxation without representation." They succeeded in
getting the amount reduced to a comparatively small sum.

There are some other instances of the public assembling of
women. Under the empire there was an assembly of women
known as the conventus matronarum, or the "little senate,"
as one writer of the time named it. The Emperor Heliogabalus
built on the Quirinal a meeting-place for this body.
This body of matrons met and discussed and voted upon and
decided the various points of court etiquette, such as questions
of dress, precedence, and the use of carriages.

The public standing of the citizen-woman at Athens has
been given in the quotations on pages 179-181, which may be
compared with the public standing of the citizen-woman at
Rome as given in the following:

"If we take the period of Roman history from 150 B.      C.
to 150 A.      D., we shall be surprised at the number of the
women of whom it is recorded that they were loved ardently
by their husbands, exercised a beneficial influence on them,
and helped them in their political or literary work. Many of
these women had received an excellent education, they were
capable and thoughtful, and took an active interest in the
welfare of the State. It is well known that it was Cornelia,
the mother of the Gracchi, who inspired her sons with the
resolution to cope with the evils that beset the State, and her
purpose did not waver when she knew they had to face death
in their country's cause. Julia, the daughter of Julius
Cæsar, and the wife of Pompey, kept the two leaders on good
terms as long as she lived, and acted with great sweetness and
prudence. Cornelia, Pompey's second wife, was a woman of
great culture, and a most faithful and devoted wife. Plutarch
thus describes her: 'The young woman possessed many
charms besides her youthful beauty, for she was well instructed
in letters, in playing on the lyre, and in geometry,
and she had been accustomed to listen to philosophical discourses
with profit. In addition to this, she had a disposition
free from all affectation and pedantic display, which such ac[Pg 221]quirements
generally breed in women.' The intervention of
Octavia, the wife of Antony, in affairs of state was entirely
beneficial and judicious. The first Agrippina displayed courage
and energy, herself crushed a mutiny among the soldiers,
and was in every way a help to her husband. Tacitus praises
his mother-in-law, the wife of Agricola, as a model of virtue,
and he describes her as living in the utmost harmony with her
husband, each preferring the other in love. And Pliny the
younger gives a beautiful picture of his wife Calpurnia, telling
a friend how she showed the greatest ability, frugality,
and knowledge of literature. Especially 'she has my books,'
he says; 'she reads them again and again; she even commits
them to memory. What anxiety she feels when I am going to
make a speech before the judges, what joy when I have finished
it. She places people here and there in the audience
to bring her word what applauses have been accorded to my
speech, what has been the issue of the trial. If I give readings
of my works anywhere, she sits close by, separated by a
screen, and drinks in my praises with most greedy ears. My
verses also she sings, and sets them to the music of the lyre,
no artist guiding her, but only love, who is the best master.'

"These are only a few of the numerous instances that
might be adduced, in which wives behaved with a gentleness
or courage or self-abnegation worthy of all praise. It is
true that they took an active part in the management of
affairs, but, on the whole, it must be allowed that they acted
with great good sense. And there is a curious proof of this
in the times of the Empire. Wives went with their husbands
to their provinces, and often took part in the administration
of them. Some of the old stern moralists were for putting an
end to this state of matters, and proposed that they should
not be allowed to accompany their husbands to their spheres
of duty; but, after a debate in the Senate, the measure was
rejected by a large majority, who thereby affirmed that their
help was beneficial.

"No doubt it was their good sense, their kindliness, and
their willingness to co-operate with men, that led to their
freedom and power in political matters. And this power
was sometimes very great. Cicero, in a letter to Atticus, relates
an interview which he had at Antium 44 B.      C. with
Brutus and Cassius. Favorinus was also present, and besides
him there were three women       Servilia, the mother of Brutus;
Tertulla, the wife of Cassius and sister of Brutus; and Porcia,[Pg 222]
the wife of Brutus and daughter of Cato. Servilia strikes in
twice in the course of the discussion, and it is evident that her
words carried weight. On one occasion she promises to get
a clause expunged from a decree of the Senate. There must
have been many such deliberations where women were
present."180

Since women entered into public affairs at Rome, it would
be natural to conclude they would enter upon some of the
public vocations that were occupied solely by men in the
earlier times. It would seem that they did enter into the
medical profession but, perhaps, not the better class of women
and maybe not the citizen-women at all. Since medical art
was introduced from Greece, most all the men that followed it
were Greek freedmen and likewise the women were likely of
the same nationality and standing. Whether there were
women lawyers or not, it is true women were permitted to appear
in court in their own defense, which some few, at least,
did. In religion the cult of Vesta was entirely in their hands,
they had the leading part in conducting the rites of Ceres and
other female deities, and the wives of priests in some instances
held official positions along with their husbands.

"Women occupied themselves, too, with literature. Very
little is known of their writings and this mostly from the male
writers of their period, who did not place a high estimate
upon these compositions of the women, either prose or poetry.
Many of the women who did not take an active part in literature
did interest themselves in the writings of relatives and
friends. Other women became critics and took pride in expressing
their views, while others directed their energies toward
philosophy and science.

"Ladies, when not poets, were critics, and as such, deemed
by Juvenal worse than tipplers. Before they had been five
minutes at table, they began to discourse æsthetically on
Homer and Virgil, monopolizing the conversation, with a
hammer and tong-like effect. They paraded their snacks of
knowledge, made quotations from forgotten authors; grammar
in hand, corrected their friends' slips. A woman, says
Juvenal, may have the encyclopædia by heart and yet know
nothing. Martial, too, mocks the purist woman, and yearns, as
his life-wish, for a not too learned wife."181[Pg 223]

"In the good old days of the legitimate drama under
Plautus, Terence, Accius, and Pacuvius, women never appeared
upon the stage. Feminine rôles were taken by men in
female dress. But, with the appearance of the mime and the
farce in the first century before our era, women began to take
part in theatrical and musical performances. Their larger
participation in such matters under the Empire is proved by
the discovery of the burying place of a guild of women mimes,
just outside of Rome, along the highways leading from the
city. Women took a very active part in public musical performances,
if we may draw an inference from the number of
epitaphs which we find in honor of women who had been solo
singers and flute players."182 Women entered, also, into the
commoner affairs of public life, as costumers, seamstresses,
washerwomen, weavers, fishmongers, barmaids, and the like.

"If we make a general survey of the facts which have
been noted above, it is clear that Roman women took an active
part in the literary and religious life of the time, and in many
of the cults held priesthoods or officially recognized positions
from very early times. Their interest in literature, however,
was not serious, and they have produced very little of permanent
value. In the practice of law they never succeeded in
getting a sure foothold. Women of the lower classes entered
freely into the medical profession and the trades, but so far
as medicine is concerned women confined their practice to
members of their own sex. The principal branches of business
which they took up were those connected with the manufacture
of wearing apparel. The pursuits of the shopkeeper
and the artisan were naturally left to the lower classes, but
women of standing in society engaged in industries organized
on a large scale, as we can see clearly enough in the case of
the brick business."183

In the early days of Rome, while the people were struggling
to maintain themselves and the nation, the virtue of the
women stood out strong. But as the days of hardships passed
and comfort and ease and luxury came in with the conquests,
laxity of morals arose till under the empire, if the writers of
the times may be believed, licentiousness and not virtue was
the dominant trait of the women as well as the men. Yet
there were many good women, as is shown in the quotations
a few pages back.[Pg 224]

The social vices of Asia found place in Rome and while
heretofore only the foreign women were of evil character, at
the time of the empire the citizen-women entered into the life,
and in 19 A.      D. even a woman of prætorian birth registered
herself at the ædile's as a prostitute. This created quite a
feeling at Rome and a decree was made by the Senate that any
woman whose grandfather, father, or husband had been a
knight should not be enrolled as a public woman.

The public life of the times, too, tended toward the lowering
of the standard of women. The circus, the theater, and the
amphitheater were open to them and they attended in great
numbers and witnessed the indecent and obscene acts and the
debasing fights and slaughters. It became the fashion for
women even of the highest rank to interest themselves in the
actors, athletes, circus-drivers, gladiators, stage-singers, vocalists,
and musicians, and often going into excesses. Pantomime
dancers were the favorites with the women as they
"were very beautiful young men, whose art lent them fresh
grace. About 22 or 23 A.      D. they were banished from Italy,
on account of the factions they caused, and their relations
with women, who must have been of high rank, otherwise no
such ordinance would have been passed."184 Also there were
the banquets, which gave further opportunities for the meeting
of the women with the men. With their obscene songs
and dances and stories added to enflaming food and drinks,
they helped to debase women and to arouse their passions.


Marriage. In the earlier days of Rome, when religion was
purer than in later times, and children were desired to perpetuate
the household religion, celibacy was looked upon as
an undesired state and deserving censure; but in later times,
when high moral and religious tendencies went down, childlessness
was preferred to parenthood and celibacy to marriage.
Marriage was a very important affair as it meant the
bringing of a stranger into the household to enter into the
family worship, to take part in the sacrifices to the household
gods, the deities which presided over the welfare of that particular
family. Thus it was a solemn obligation and one
which deserved careful consideration. Up to the time of
Augustus, there were no laws in regard to marriage, except
as to the disposition of the dowries, as previous to that time
it was deemed essentially a private transaction.

To understand marriage at Rome, it is needed to keep in[Pg 225]
mind that a woman was always considered to be under the
control of a man       father, husband, or guardian. Marriage
might or might not mean the transfer of this right to the
husband, so that there were two general kinds of marriage
contracts. By the one, cum conventione, the wife passed from
her father's family into the family of her husband, in manum
convenit, and stood in relation to her husband as a daughter,
she surrendered her patrimony and became one of her husband's
legal heirs. In the second, sine conventione, the wife
remained under the rule of her father, as before the marriage,
and retained her own property and her right of inheritance
in her father's estate. In the first case, the wife became a
materfamilias while in the second she was simply an uxor.

In the marriage, sine conventione, there was, perhaps, no
form required as cohabitation of the man and woman constituted
the marriage. In the marriage, cum conventione, there
were three forms       usus, coemptio, and confarreatio. Marriage
by usus prevailed among the plebian, common people;
marriage by coemptio was the one commonly practised by the
middle classes; and marriage by confarreatio was the favorite
form in the highest social circles.

Marriage by usus was the simplest form, in which the wife
entered into her husband's manus, if she lived a whole year
in the man's house, both parties agreeing to the relation. In
this case then the father's power was gone and he could not
even compel the wife to leave her husband's home. But
should the woman absent herself from the man's house for
three nights in succession during the year, then the bond was
broken. In the times when divorce was denied to the woman,
she would often avail herself of this right of remaining away
three nights in a year, so that if need arose she could have
herself claimed by her father or guardian and in this way
she could leave her husband.

In marriage by coemptio, there was a kind of mutual purchase,
a fictitious sale, which the couple made to each other of
their person, in which each delivered to the other a small
piece of money and repeated certain words. The father
emancipated his daughter in favor of her future husband and
she came to sustain to the husband the relation of a daughter,
took his name, gave up all her goods to him, and declared that
she entered into the union of her own free will.

Marriage by confarreatio was the only form that required
religious ceremonies. This was the most solemn and stately[Pg 226]
form of marriage as well as the oldest. By it the wife came
into the absolute power of the husband by sacred laws but
likewise she became a partner in all his substance and in his
sacred rights. In case of the husband's death without will the
wife inherited equally with the children and if no children
then she inherited his whole fortune. This was a public ceremony,
conducted by the pontifex maximus or the flamen dialis,
in the presence of at least ten witnesses, and the bridal couple
tasted a cake made of a sort of wheat called far, which with
a sheep, was offered in sacrifice to the gods. The priests
themselves had to be married by this ceremony and none but
the children of such marriage could ever become flamen of
Jupiter, Mars, or Quirinus, or vestal virgins.

A true marriage could be made only between Roman
citizens, but as Roman citizenship became widely extended
there was thus much latitude for choice. The lowest age for
marriage was fixed by law at fourteen for the males and
twelve for the female, but usually the girl did not marry before
fifteen or sixteen and the boy not till he attained manhood,
yet there were a number of instances of early marriages.
A woman of twenty or a man of twenty-five who was not a
parent became liable to the decree of Augustus against celibacy
and childlessness. All within the sixth degree of relationship
were originally prohibited from marriage, but later
this was lowered to relatives of the fourth degree and when,
in 49 A.      D., the Senate permitted the Emperor Claudius to
marry Agrippina, the daughter of his brother Germanicus, it
was lowered to the third degree. But a woman was not permitted
to marry her maternal uncle nor a man either his paternal
or maternal aunt.

Marriage was a family arrangement, a matter of family
convenience, hence, although the law made the consent of the
girl necessary, yet really it was wholly in the hands of the
parents, for it is well known that children were sometimes
betrothed by the parents at a very early age, and the girl was
married at the beginning of her thirteenth year, both betrothal
and marriage being at an age when the child was wholly under
the control of the parent. In the early times, the betrothal
was a simple affair but later it became quite formal. This
occurred at night or early morning, in the latter case the
friends assembling at early dawn at the home of the girl's
father or the nearest relative. The amount of the girl's dowry[Pg 227]
having been agreed upon, a contract was drawn up and signed
and sealed by both parties in the presence of witnesses. The
boy then gave the girl, as a pledge, an iron ring without ornament
or jewels, which the girl placed upon the third finger of
the left hand, as from this was believed to be a nerve leading
directly to the heart. This was followed by a banquet or
feast. The engagement might be broken by either party or by
the guardians of either with no legal penalty attached and
sometimes this gave the young man or young woman opportunity
to escape a union not desired. But as long as a betrothal
lasted it imposed certain restrictions, one being that
betrothed persons could not testify against one another in the
courts. There was usually quite an interval of time between
the betrothal and the marriage, but that did not affect the relations
of the couple, as they were not together any more than
before the betrothal so that really they did not get to know
one another till after they were married.

On the night before her marriage the girl put off her toga
prætexta and her mother placed on her a long white garment
called a tunica recta or regilla, and her loosened hair was confined
in a scarlet net. The next day, the wedding-day, the
girl put on her wedding-dress, which was a long white robe,
gathered in at the waist by a woolen girdle tied in the knot of
Hercules, a true-lover's knot, and said to be a charm against
the evil eye. The flammeum, or wedding-veil, was of a brilliant
orange red, or flame-color, quite full, of thin, fine stuff,
and it was thrown over the head from behind, leaving the face
exposed, and then draped gracefully about her. The bride's
hair was divided into six strands or stresses by the bridegroom
with the point of a spear, and then ribbons or fillets were
bound between the tresses and the hair was braided and confined
to the head. On these braids and under the veil was
worn a garland of natural flowers which the bride herself
had gathered.

"The costume of the bride is a complete allegory. This
orange-red veil, this saffron-colored flammeum, which covers
her head and allows only the face to be seen, is the usual
ornament of the flamen's wife, to whom divorce is prohibited;
the white tunic represents virginity; the head-dress raised in
the form of a tower, almost like that of the vestals, with a
javelot which runs through it, indicates that the wife is in
submission to her husband; the chaplet of vervain is the[Pg 228]
symbol of fecundity, and the girdle of wool which is tied round
her waist bears witness to her chastity."185

Weddings could not take place on any day of the year as
there were restrictions in reference to such. As a great
number of religious festivals occurred in the early summer,
requiring the constant attendance of the priests, marriages
were forbidden to take place during the whole month of May
and the first half of June. On the dies parentales, from the
thirteenth to the twenty-first of February, marriages could
not take place, as on these days there were memorial services
for deceased kindred and offerings to their manes. Wedding-days
could not be placed upon August 24, October 5, and November
8, as the underworld was supposed to stand open on
these days, so they were most unlucky days. Nor could such
other unlucky days be used as the kalenda, nones, or ides of
any month. Nor was it considered appropriate for young
girls to be married on religious holidays, although widows
could do so. The best time was considered to be that which
followed the ides of June.

The guests having assembled in the early morning at the
home of the bride's father, or of her nearest relative, the
bride being decked out in her wedding garments and the
bridegroom having arrived, the wedding ceremonies began
with the taking of auspices. In earlier times this was done by
observing the flight of birds, but later by the examination of
the entrails of an animal, which was conducted by an
haruspex, a professional diviner. If the omens were favorable,
then the wedding sacrifice was made, usually a sheep,
and the skin was spread over stools or chairs, on which the
bridal pair sat. The right hands of the pair were then joined
by a pronuba, a woman who had been married but once and
who thus acted as a kind of priestess, and the bride signified
her willingness to come into the manus of the bridegroom and
to take his name by repeating the formula, "Quando tu Gaius,
ego Gaia," "You being Gaius, I am Gaia." The wedding
party then went to a temple or public altar, where offerings
and prayer were made to the flamen dialis to the gods, especially
to June as the patron of marriage. During the offering,
the bridal pair sat side by side, while during the prayer they
walked together slowly around the altar. These completed,
then all returned to the house of the bride's father where a
great feast was held.[Pg 229]

At nightfall the feast ended and then came the deductio,
the leading home of the bride. The bridegroom and his
friends made a pretense of snatching the bride away from her
father's house, in commemoration of the rape of the Sabines.
In reality the father was the only one who could break the
bonds that attached the bride to the hearth of her ancestors,
where she was under the protection of the household gods, and
so he handed her over to the husband and his family to enter
into the new relations with them. The bride was escorted by
three boys, sons of living parents, two of them holding her by
the hand, the other one going before her bearing the bridal
torch of white thorn, to drive away the malevolent spirits.
Her way was lighted by four married women bearing pine
torches and behind her was borne a distaff, a spindle, and in
a basket the instruments for feminine work. The procession
went through the streets singing, accompanied by flutes, bonfires
were lit in the streets and the streets were lined with
people, and specially with children, as the bridegroom threw
nuts to them to show that he had given up childish things,
the bride also having given up her dolls and playthings by
offering them to the household gods who had protected her
childhood.

As the bride came to the door of her new home, she rubbed
oil on the doorposts and then wound woolen bands around
them, in order to keep off baleful spells. She was then lifted
up by her companions so that her feet might not touch the
threshold, sacred to Vesta, the virgin goddess. In the atrium,
she received from her husband the symbolic gifts of fire and
water. The two then knelt together and with the bridal torch
lighted their first hearth fire, offered a sacrifice, and broke the
cake of far, and ate it together. The husband then presented
the keys of the house to the wife to show that henceforth she
was to have the management of the household. The day was
ended with a feast given by the bridegroom to the relatives
and friends.

"No one who studies this ceremonial of Roman marriage, in
the light of the ideas which it indicates and reflects, can avoid
the conclusion that the position of the married woman must
have been one of substantial dignity, calling for and calling
out a corresponding type of character. Beyond doubt the
position of the Roman materfamilias was a much more dignified
one than that of the Greek wife. She was far indeed from
being a mere drudge or squaw; she shared with her husband[Pg 230]
in all the duties of the household, including those of religion,
and within the house itself she was practically supreme. She
lived in the atrium, and was not shut away in a woman's
chamber; she nursed her own children and brought them
up; she had entire control of the female slaves who were her
maids; she took her meals with her husband, but sitting, not
reclining, and abstaining from wine; in all practical matters
she was consulted, and only on questions politically and intellectual
was she expected to be silent. When she went out
arrayed in the graceful stola matronalis, she was treated with
respect, and the passers-by made way for her; but it is characteristic
of her position that she did not as a rule leave the
house without the knowledge of her husband, or without an
escort."186

The wife was expected to lament for her husband upon his
death and during the time of mourning certain prohibitions
were imposed upon her, but these were not imposed upon the
widower. Severe penalties were placed upon a widow who
married within ten months after the death of her husband.
When a widow married, if the husband went to live in her
home, the bed upon which the former husband died was removed,
the door of the bed-chamber was changed, and the
things in the rooms were moved about, that there might be as
few reminders as possible of the former husband.

Concubinage existed, but not polygamy, as monogamy was
strictly enforced at Rome. This was so closely guarded that
a divorced man could not marry again unless the divorce was
an effective one. Concubinage was usually between parties
that could not enter into a legal marriage, and thus the concubine
was usually a woman of low estate, often a freedwoman.
The offspring were considered illegitimate and could
not enter into the inheritance.

In the early times there were no divorces in Rome. It is
claimed that there were no divorces during the first five hundred
years from the founding of the city, the first divorce
occurring about 231 B.      C., when Spurius Carvilius Ruga put
away his wife because she was barren. But divorces increased
till in the last years of the republic and under the
empire they became very frequent. "Seneca says, some
women counted their years, not by consuls, but by their husbands;
and Juvenal, that some divorced before the green bays
of welcome had faded on the lintels, and they might have had[Pg 231]
eight husbands in five years; Tertullian, that women marry
only in order to divorce; these exaggerations must have a
foundation in truth.... Ovid and Pliny the younger
had three wives; Cæsar and Antony four; Sulla and Pompey
five; such cases must have been frequent."187

There were a number of causes for divorce, in the later
days, the most common one being incompatibility of temper.
In the divorce, the tablets of the contract were broken in the
presence of seven witnesses, all adult Roman citizens. Repudiation
was a less solemn act and took place quietly in the
family. In the early times, when a woman was divorced she
lost her dowry. In later times, a sixth was kept back for
adultery and an eighth for other crimes. Then, still later, it
came about that if the husband was divorced by the wife he
lost the dowry, but if the wife divorced him without a cause
the husband retained a sixth of the dowry for each child, but
only up to three-sixths.


Dress. The Romans had two principal articles of dress       the
toga and the tunica. The toga was made of white woolen
cloth. On festival days a new one was worn or one newly
cleaned. It was woven in an oblong form and the corners
were clipped off till it took the form of an ellipse. Its length
was about three times the height of the wearer, exclusive of
the head, and its breadth at the middle about twice the same
height, although the breadth varied with time and fashion, as,
in the early period it was rather narrow, while in later times
a fashionable toga was nearly circular. In putting it on, the
toga was folded in its long way nearly in the middle and one
end was thrown over the left shoulder from behind and allowed
to fall to the feet in front. The other end was then
brought across the back and under the right arm and the folds
were spread out to cover the right side of the body to the calf
of the leg and then gathered and carried across the breast
and thrown backward over the left shoulder. Thus one-third
of the toga would cover the left side and front of the body, the
middle third would cover the back and right side, and the remaining
third would cover the chest and go over the left
shoulder. The diagonal folds across the breast formed the
sinus, which was often used as a pocket. It would seem that
a girdle was not worn with the toga nor pins or clasps to
fasten it, but in later fashionable times small pieces of lead
were placed in the ends and hidden by tassels which served to[Pg 232]
preserve the drapery. The white toga, without color, toga
pura, was the ordinary garment worn. Boys wore the toga
prætexta, which had a purple border, and which was discarded
when manhood was reached at fifteen or sixteen for the
toga virilis, pura or libera. The toga for mourning was black
and in later times dark blue also was used. Beside these there
were other kinds. Only Roman citizens were allowed to wear
the toga.

The tunica was worn indoors, when the toga was thrown off,
and also outdoors, when the toga was worn over it. In the
later times in cold weather two or more tunics were worn.
The tunica was a kind of woolen shirt, at first without sleeves,
then with short sleeves reaching to the elbows, and in the time
of the empire long sleeves were attached to it. It reached
down to the calves and even to the ankles. It was often
fastened to the waist by a girdle, which was used as a purse
for holding money.

Another garment was the pænula, a kind of cloak made of
thick wool and leather, and worn over the toga in traveling
in bad weather. Another kind of cloak, worn over the toga
or tunica, was the lacuna, which was made of lighter and more
costly material and was worn for show as well as for use. To
both pænula and lacuna could be added a hood (cucullus) for
further protection from the weather.

The women in the early times wore the toga and the tunica
the same as the men. The tunica continued to be worn but
there arose as distinct apparel for women, the stola and the
palla. The stola was an oblong garment worn over the tunica
and extended to the feet. It was open at the top on either
side for the arms to go through and fastened on both shoulders
with clasps or brooches (fibulæ), which often were quite costly
articles. A girdle was drawn around it at the waist and then
it was pulled up and allowed to fall over the girdle till the
girdle was covered by the folds and then the lower part of
the stola was pulled down till it just touched the ground. At
the bottom there was an ornamental border. Sometimes there
were sleeves to it, which were open below and fastened together
with gold or jeweled buttons or clasps. The stola was
a special garment that was permitted to be worn only by married
women of unblemished reputation. "The common courtesans
were not allowed to appear in the stola, but were compelled
to wear a sort of gown, resembling the habit of the[Pg 233]
opposite sex, and which was regarded as a mark of infamy."188

The palla was a kind of cloak worn out of doors over the
stola. It was somewhat similar to the toga, as it was a square
or oblong piece of cloth. Like the toga, too, it was thrown forward
over the left shoulder and let fall to the feet, and then
drawn over or under the right shoulder and pulled across the
breast and thrown over the left arm or shoulder. When
necessary to protect the head, the palla could be drawn up
over it like the toga.

The prevalent material of Roman clothing was always
woolen and up to the end of the republic the only materials
used were wool and linen. Sheep-raising for wool was one
of the very most important industries. Foreign wools, however,
were imported, because the supply of native wool was
not sufficient to meet the demand and also by importing
foreign wool a variety of natural colors could be obtained, as
brown, red, black, golden-brown, reddish, and grayish.
Goats' wool was not often used for wearing apparel, usually
only for coarse cloaks and overshoes. It was woven into
rough and heavy cloths for tent-coverings, blankets, and the
like, and goats' hair was used for making ropes and cables.

Linen was used for the under-garments of both men and
women and for women's belts and girdles and also linen
thread was made. In the later times the finer grades of linen
for handkerchiefs, table-cloths, napkins, bedding, and suits
were all imported. Cotton and cotton fabrics were introduced
from the far East into Greece and thence into Rome.
Silk began to be used by the women toward the end of the
republic and by men under the empire.

The color of clothing was originally white, which was prescribed
by law for the toga. Poor people, slaves, and freedmen
had their clothing of the natural brown or black color of
the wool. The mourning garments of the upper classes were
of dark color       black or dark blue. In later periods the
women got to using a variety of colors, selecting such as the
mode directed or as suited their particular taste, as scarlet,
violet, purple, yellow, blue, and many other colors. In
imperial times the men adopted a variety of colors for their
garments, too. The wearing of genuine purple, however, remained
the exclusive privilege of the emperors.

In early times the spinning and weaving was done at home[Pg 234]
under the direction of the mistress of the house. But it was
not long till the work of the home did not suffice to supply the
demand and large factories (officionæ) were established for
the weaving of both woolen and linen goods. The garments
were prepared with needle and scissors, each wealthy household
having several tailors among its slaves. Before they
could be used for garments, the woolen cloths had to be finished
by the fuller, who not only finished new cloths but also
cleansed and restored old garments.

The Romans, usually, whether indoors or out, went bareheaded,
both men and women. In case of heat or cold or rain,
the men would pull the upper part of the toga up over the
head and the women used the palla in the same way. There
were times, however, when they did wear coverings upon their
heads, as, at the sacrifices, at the public games, at the Saturnalia,
upon a journey, or upon a warlike expedition. Also
the working-classes exposed to the weather wore a head-covering.
These coverings were the pileus and the petasus. The
pileus was a close-fitting felt cap and the petasus was a felt
hat with a round brim. Sometimes the cucullus, a hood, was
worn in place of the pileus. For ornamentation the women
would wear a veil, which was fastened to the top of the head
and drooped over neck and back in graceful folds. They also
wore the mitra, which was a cloth wound round the head to
form a kind of cap. They also wore a head-covering in the
form of a net made of gold-thread.

In the early times men wore their hair long and this was
continued for a long time and the wearing of short hair made
slow progress and only among the higher classes. In the
late empire the close-cropped hair became the fashion. Before
the time of cropped hair it was sometimes worn in wavy locks
and again, by means of the curling-iron, it was arranged in
short curls and perfumed. Also false hair was used. The
ancient Romans wore their beards very long. The wearing
the beard long continued till the later years of the republic
when it became the custom to shave the face, but full beards
came into fashion again in the later empire. "The first hair
cut from the head of a child, and a youth's first beard, were
consecrated to the gods; but the coins of the late republican
period show plainly that young men usually wore a beard,
though carefully trimmed and dressed, and were seldom clean-shaven
before forty."189 There were barber-shops among the[Pg 235]
Romans and they were the gathering-places of idlers and the
centers of male gossip. Among the furnishings were razors,
tools to pull out the beard, scissors, pomatums to remove hair
where not desired, combs, curling-irons, mirrors, towels, etc.

The ways of arranging the hair by the women varied in the
different periods. In the first centuries of the republic, there
seems to have been two general fashions. The hair was
either parted or unparted and then combed back in wavy
lines and gathered together in a knot at the back of the head,
low down on the neck, and fastened with ribbons or clasps, or
it was wound round the top of the head like a crown. In
another way the hair was carried around the head in long
curls, or the front hair was plaited and connected with the
back hair, etc. These simple ways of arranging the hair gave
place to many variegated ways and hair-dressing became a
science and the women employed special maid-servants for the
purpose or had in their employ female hairdressers. In one
fashion there was a tower-like headdress, the natural hair
being helped out with artificial hair or with wigs. The hair
was frizzled and curled and perfumed and dyed. It was
kept in place by means of ribbons and pins and hair-pins of
metal or ivory and adorned with gold ornaments and pearls
and jewels. The hair was sometimes gracefully adorned with
wreaths of flowers or of branches with leaves and blossoms.

The Romans wore shoes (calcei) and sandals (sandalia).
There were several kinds of shoes worn, as every Roman
order and every tribe or gens had a distinctive kind of shoe.
The sutor, or shoemaker, had a particularly respectable calling
at Rome. The pero was for wet and snowy weather; it was
made of raw hide and it was similar to a boot, reaching up to
the middle of the leg. The calceus senatorius was of black
leather with four straps. The calceus mulleus was made of
red leather, with a high heel, and with straps to fasten it
about the ankle. It had on its front a crescent-shaped piece
of ivory, the lunula, which was of very ancient origin, and,
like the bulla, may, perhaps, have had the force of a charm.
The caliga was worn by the soldiers, which was a kind of
boot, reaching to the middle of the leg, and the sole was of
wood and stuck full of nails. There seemed to have been
worn, too, a kind of sock or stocking that reached to the
middle of the leg and tied with laces from the instep to the
calf. The ladies of the upper classes, for outdoors wore shoes
made of fine leather and richly embroidered in silk and[Pg 236]
gold. In the house both men and women wore sandals
(soleæ). The sandals and shoes were tied on with straps,
which were wound round the foot and the leg upward from
the ankle.

The Roman ladies wore many different kinds of ornaments,
made of precious metals, ivory, jewels, and pearls. They
wore earrings, a very common form being pearls and jewels
attached to hooks of gold and then fastened to the ears.
There were hair-pins of metal and ivory, made in various
forms, some of which contained eyes for the fastening of
strings of pearls. They had necklaces of gold with jewels and
pearls attached to them. Bracelets, made in the form of
snakes, simple ribbons, plaited gold threads, and other styles,
were worn at the wrist or above the elbow, with a sleeveless
tunic. They had rings adorned with jewels and cameos.
They wore chains of gold around the neck, sometimes five or
six feet in length. They fastened their girdles and other parts
of the dress with buckles and brooches, made of silver and
gold and frequently studded with jewels and cameos. Some
of these ornaments were also worn by the men, as, rings and
bracelets. All the principal precious stones, diamonds, rubies,
emeralds, opals, were known to the Romans. They prized the
pearl above all other gems and often paid great prices for
them. "Julius Cæsar is said to have given to Servilia, the
mother of Marcus Brutus, a solitaire pearl for which he paid
six million sesterces ($262,500), while Caligula received with
his wife, Lollia Paulina a complete parure of pearls and emeralds,
which was an heirloom in her family; a part of the
spoils taken in Eastern war by her grandfather, Marcus Lollius,
in the year 2 B.      C., and valued at forty million sesterces
($2,180,000)."190

"About the mysteries of the toilette of the Roman ladies,
mercilessly laid bare by the authors of imperial times, we shall
say little. Great care was particularly bestowed on the
complexion, and on the artificial reproduction of other charms,
lost too soon in the exciting atmosphere of imperial court-life.
During the night a mask (tectorium) of dough and ass's milk
was laid on the face, to preserve the complexion; this mask
was an invention of Poppæa, the wife of Nero, hence its name
Poppæana. Another mask, composed of rice and bean-flour,
served to remove the wrinkles from the face. It was washed
off in the morning with tepid ass's milk and the face after[Pg 237]wards
bathed in fresh ass's milk several times in the course
of the day. Poppæa was, for the purpose, always accompanied
in her travels by herds of she-asses. The two chief paints
used for the face were a white (creta cerussa) and a red substance
(fucus minium purpurissum), moistened with spittle.
Brows and eyelashes were dyed black, or painted over; even
the veins on the temples were masked with lines of a tender
blue color. Many different pastes and powders were used to
preserve and clean the teeth. Artificial teeth made of ivory
and fastened with gold thread were known to the Romans
at the time when the laws of the twelve tablets were made,
one of which laws prohibited the deposition of gold in the
graves of the dead, excepting the material required for the
fastening of false teeth."191

As an aid in the preparation of the toilet and the like, the
Romans had mirrors. These were not made of glass but of
polished metal. They were square or round and of various
sizes, some being equal in size to a grown-up person. Some
of the mirrors had handles for holding with the hand, some
were made so as to hang on the wall, and others could be
placed upright.


Food. The Romans of the early times had a simple fare,
living chiefly on pottage, or bread and pot-herbs. They sat
at their meals, using a long table. As the nation grew and
wealth increased and they came in contact with older nations,
they gave up this simple life and entered among the most
luxurious nations in their manner of living.

The Romans had three meals a day. The first meal was in
the morning, the ientaculum, or breakfast, which was simple,
consisting of bread flavored with salt or dipped in wine, olives,
grapes, eggs, and cheese. The second meal was at midday, the
cena, or dinner, which with the country people was the principal
meal. In the city this midday meal was a lunch, the
prandium, while the cena, dinner, was taken later in the day,
toward evening, and often became quite an elaborate affair.
There was sometimes a fourth meal, comissatio, served late
at night, which really was but little more than a drinking-bout.

The meals were usually served in the triclinium, or dining-room.
In this was a square dining-table, having on three sides
one-armed couches, the remaining side being left open for
serving. Each of these couches had room for three persons,[Pg 238]
who reclined upon the left arm, with the feet outward. About
the end of the republic, round tables came into use, with semicircular
couches. Some of these tables were quite valuable,
being made of rare imported woods. The guests used napkins,
which they might have brought themselves or were provided
by the host. In later times table-cloths came into use.
The principal ornament on the table was the salinum, or salt-cellar,
as salt was used not only for seasoning, but also for
sacrifices, and the salinum also held the sacrificial cakes. The
chief implements for eating were two kinds of spoons, the
ligula, shaped very much like the table spoon of the present,
and the cochlear, which had a small circular bowl, flat or
slightly hollowed, with a pointed handle. Knives and forks
seem to have come into use during the later times of the
empire.

The chief dish of the poorer classes was porridge, made of
a farinaceous substance and which served them as bread.
They had such vegetables as the cabbage, turnip, radish, leek,
garlic, onion, cucumber, and pumpkin. Meat was rarely eaten,
perhaps only on festival occasions. The market afforded all
kinds of foods. Among the animals were the rabbit, pheasant,
guinea-fowl, common poultry, peacock, kid, pig, and
boar; there were various kinds of fish and oysters and snails;
beside the plants mentioned above were rue, lettuce, cress,
mallow, and sorrell. It would seem that they had quite a
number of different kinds of grain; among the fruits were the
apple, pear, plum, cherry, quince, peach, pomegranate, fig,
olive, and grape; there were lemons and oranges and nuts of
various kinds.

Wine was the only drink of an intoxicating nature that the
Romans had. It was customary to mix the wine with water,
and to drink the wine without putting water into it was considered
a sign of intemperance. For a number of years the
water-supply was such as could be obtained from the Tiber,
wells, and natural springs, and it was not till the time of the
republic that the water was brought from outside of Rome, for
which means aqueducts were built and which continued to be
built until there was an abundant supply of water.


Child and Parent. The Romans practiced the exposure of
infants as in Greece. This was begun in the early times and
carried down into the later times. The children so exposed
were usually feeble or deformed, but the father had the power
to use it on any child and this was sometimes done when the[Pg 239]
father considered the child to be illegitimate. The new-born
child was laid at the feet of the father and it was his duty to
take the child up into his arms and declare it to be his child
and that he would rear it and support it. In case the father
did not so claim it, the child was carried away and placed at
some cross-roads, where it would die unless taken up by a
slave-merchant to rear it to sell.

The relation which existed between the father and the child
was known as the patria potestas. This power of the father
was very great in early times. He could sell his children, disinherit
them, select a wife for a son or a husband for a daughter,
and he even had the power to put them to death. This
power ceased only at death or if the father lost his rights of
Roman citizenship. The father himself could emancipate his
son. Also this power over the son ceased should he become a
flamen, or priest, and it ceased over the daughter if she married
or took the vestal vows.


Names. The Romans had three names: These were the
prænomen, the individual's own first name; the nomen,
the name of the gens or family to which he belonged; and the
cognomen, or surname, which distinguished the particular
branch or division of the tribe from which he sprung. Thus
in the name Marcus Tullius Cicero, Marcus was the prænomen,
Tullius the nomen, designating the Tullian family, and Cicero,
the cognomen, showing that he was from the Cicerones branch
of the tribe.

The boys received the nomen, family name, on the ninth day
after birth and girls on the eighth day. On such day the
ceremony of purification took place, which was by sprinkling
with a branch of olive or laurel dipped in water, the burning
of incense, and the offering of sacrifice. The boy was given
his prænomen when he put on the toga virilis at sixteen or
seventeen and the girl when she was married. The wife at
marriage took the nomen of her husband's family, but this
was not often a change from her own family as usually marriages
were between members of the same gens. In later
times, when marriage did not mean so much, and divorces
became frequent, the wife did not take her husband's nomen
but she was known by the nomen of her father's gens.


Care and Treatment of Children. The birth of a son was
a happy day in a Roman household and the door of the house
was decorated with flowers and green branches. The boy's
ninth day after birth and the girl's eighth day was the day[Pg 240]
of purification, the lustratio. A branch of laurel or olive was
dipped into water and used to sprinkle the child, incense was
burned, a sacrifice was made upon the family altar for the
child's welfare, and he was carried to one or more of the
temples and placed under the protection of the gods. Also,
as stated above, the child's name was bestowed upon him at
this time. Usually a private record was made of the time of
the lustratio, which was sometimes offered in cases of identification.
Under Marcus Aurelius there was begun a public
registry of births, as it was decreed that within thirty days
after birth the name of each child, born free at Rome, should
be placed in the public records in the archives of the treasury
in the temple of Saturn. The birthday was religiously observed
by every Roman, rich or poor, high or low, at which
time the members of his family were brought together and
offerings were made to the household gods and a festive time
made of the day. Many mothers turned over their children to
the care of nurses and the wealthy employed wet-nurses.
Each Roman child wore round his neck a bulla, which was a
small locket of gold or some other metal, sometimes of leather,
usually heart-shaped, or circular, and attached to a ribbon or
chain. This was a charm against the evil eye. The boy wore
his bulla till he put on the toga virilis at manhood and a girl
wore hers till her marriage.

"Identical with modern times were the anxious care of
mothers, relatives, and nurses, the words of endearment (such
as birdie, little dove, little crow, little mother, little lady),
and the lisping childish language and the lullabies ('sleep, my
child, or suck'), rattles and other means of soothing (such as
beating the stone that had hit the child), and the many superstitions,
at all ages: such as binding on teeth of horses and
boars to alleviate the teething, and old wives' simples and
amulets against the evil eye. As a preservative against the
strigæ, or vampires, garlic was wrapt up in the swaddling-clothes
and hawthorn planted in the windows. A mother,
who was passing a temple of Venus, would mumble a prayer
for her daughter's beauty and make a vow. The figure of the
girls was made artificially perfect. They wore tight stays
from early childhood, so as to raise the hips into relief, and
nurses' carelessness often produced rounded backs or unequal
shoulders."192


Citizenship. At seventeen years of age the Roman boy be[Pg 241]came
liable for military duty. In earlier times this was the
age at which he assumed the toga virilis. In the later times
the age for taking the virile robe varied, usually taking place
between the fourteenth and seventeenth years, but there were
cases where boys were invested with the toga virilis as early
as twelve and where it was withheld until nineteen. The
time of year for this ceremony was not fixed, although a favorite
date was at the time of the Liberalia, or feast of Bacchus,
which occurred on March 17th.

"To make the gods propitious, the youth has passed the
last night of his infancy covered, like a bride on the eve of her
nuptials, with a white material and a saffron-colored sort of
net-work. Is not this a betrothal which is now to be completed:
the indissoluble union of the new citizen to the
city?"193 The bulla was removed from the boy's neck and the
toga prætexta taken off him and both were consecrated to the
lares, a sacrifice was made, and then the boy was invested with
the toga virilis. Then the boy was conducted to the Forum
by his father or guardian, accompanied by relatives and
friends, and formally presented to the public. He was, probably,
also taken to the tabularium under the Capitol and his
name enrolled among the list of full citizens.

This was a very important event in the life of the boy,
as it freed him from the control of others, as he became by
law a man, capable of looking after his own affairs and of
holding property. After this he entered upon the affairs of
life. If he was of the middle or lower classes, he entered
directly into business or work; if of the upper class, he began
to prepare for public life or the army.


Inheritance. Every citizen had the right to make a will and
to leave his property to the ones he wished to receive it.
There were two kinds of wills recognized, the one made in civil
life before the public assembly, and the other was in military
life, made when an army was drawn up ready for battle and
while the auspices were being taken.

Instead of a written will there might be an oral declaration,
which had to be made before the proper authorities and witnesses
and recorded in the city registers. If the will of the
soldier dying in battle was unfinished, it was valid if there
was no doubt as to his intentions. Those by law who could not
make a will, or whose will was invalid, were persons under the
power of another, minors, the insane, people not capable of[Pg 242]
managing their own affairs, the civilly dead, and the banished.
Where there was no will, the law provided an order
of inheritance, the children taking precedence. In case there
was neither will nor legal heir, the estate went into the public
treasury.


Adoption. It was a sacred duty for a Roman family to
preserve its name, its domestic sacrifices, and its traditions.
These were transmitted from one generation to the next, so in
case there was no son, the head of the family was authorized
by law to adopt a son. There were three kinds of adoption.
The first was adoption properly so-called; the second was
the arrogatio, adrogation; and the third was adoption made
by will or testament, to be confirmed by the proper authorities
after the death of the testator.

There were three conditions necessary to adoption. The
first requirement was that there were no sons in the family,
nor hopes of any, and that the father should be about eighteen
years older than the one to be adopted as a son; the second
condition was that the honor, religion, domestic worship, or
sacrifices of the two families, should not in any way be injured;
and the third, that there should be no fraud or collusion.

Adoption proper was for minors. The two fathers, the
natural and the adoptive, arranged the matter between them
and then, with the child, went before the proper authorities
and in the presence of witnesses was legally carried out. The
adopted son took the rank and the name of the family into
which he entered, he was introduced to the domestic sacrifices,
and he became a full heir. If there was a daughter in the
family, she became his sister and he could not marry her.

Adrogation was the form of adoption used with citizens who
were their own masters. This required the consent of the
people assembled for the purpose. Under this act a citizen
with his property and all persons subjected to him passed
into another's power.

"These adoptions finally led to abuse. The patrician, to
obtain the tribuneship, would be adopted by some plebeian,
and those who were without children, that they might enjoy
office to which only fathers of families could be elected,
adopted children, whom, after obtaining the offices, they
emancipated. This finally required, to remedy it, a decree of
the senate in the reign of Nero."194[Pg 243]


Sickness and Death. Throughout the time of Rome, medicine
was largely in the hands of slaves and freedmen. Those
engaged in the medical practice were mostly Greeks and
orientals, especially Egyptians. Up to the middle of the republic,
they treated their patients according to certain old
prescriptions and nostrums. In the later days of the republic,
the practice of medicine began to take on more the form of a
profession and later the profession became to be divided into
physicians, surgeons, and oculists, and also there were dentists,
ear specialists, and the like. There were, too, women
physicians and midwives. As those engaged in medicine were
not required to be examined and were not held by law to much
responsibility, quackery prevailed. The practice of medicine
was quite remunerative and the physicians who were successful
made large salaries.

Among the Romans the duties to the dead were carefully
attended to. They believed that the souls of those who had
not received the proper honors accorded to the dead were condemned
to wander for a long number of years along the banks
of the Styx before they were permitted to cross over into the
realms of the dead. The dying person was surrounded by his
relatives and when he had breathed his last his eyes and
mouth were closed by the nearest relative present and the
conclamatio was made, all calling out loudly three times to
the deceased as though he might be in a trance. Upon his not
awakening, the relatives and friends retired and left the body
to the professional undertaker.

The body was washed, anointed, and clothed, the coin to
pay Charon, the ferryman of the Styx, was placed between
the teeth, and then the corpse was laid upon a couch in the
atrium, with feet turned toward the entrance door. Flowers
were placed about the couch and the decorations and crowns,
if any, of the deceased were displayed about the body. To
show that the house was in mourning, branches of cypress
or pine were hung in front. The body lay in state for seven
days for visitations of kindred and friends.

The day of the funeral having arrived, the funeral procession
took place. In ancient times all funerals were in the
night time, but later they were held in the day time, yet still
later the procession went with lighted torches.

The order of the procession was arranged by the designator,
master of ceremonies, and it closely resembled a triumphal
procession. At the head marched the musicians, which might[Pg 244]
have been a single flute-player or a band of musicians with
trumpets and pipes and horns; then came the mourning-women,
hired for the occasion; next came dancers and mimes,
one of whom was dressed up to resemble the deceased, and
who acted out his character, imitating his style of speaking,
his manner, and exaggerating his peculiarities. Following
these came professional actors dressed in the garbs of the
ancestors of the deceased and wearing wax masks representing
their features, who strove to imitate them in speech and
actions. Then were displayed the crowns and rewards the
deceased had been honored with and the spoils and standards
he had taken in war. Then came the torch-bearers and lictors,
with lowered faces, followed by the nearest relatives or friends
or slaves set free by the will, bearing upon a lofty bier the
corpse extended and exposed in rich garments. Then the
family of the deceased followed, the sons with veiled faces and
the daughters with heads uncovered and hair loosened. Last
came the freedmen, slaves, clients, friends, and the general
public.

There were demonstrations of grief displayed by the mourners,
the nearest relatives tearing their clothing, pulling out
their hair, and covering their heads with dust, the women
smiting their breasts, scratching their faces, tearing their hair,
and the like.

If there was to be a funeral oration, the procession went
to the forum, the bier being set down in front of the rostrum
and surrounded by the wearers of the ancestral masks. A near
relative, usually, mounted the tribune and delivered a eulogy
upon the deceased and his ancestors. An informal eulogy
might be given at the place of interment, in which case the
procession did not stop at the forum. At the close of the
oration the procession passed on. The burial place might
have been public, along some one of the great highways leading
out of Rome, or it might have been private, upon the suburban
estate of the deceased. The vestal virgins had the right
of burial within the city itself. The body was placed in the
tomb, those present were then sprinkled, in order to purify
them, three times with a branch of olive or laurel dipped in
pure water, and then all returned from the funeral.

The above description refers to the funeral of the wealthy
and illustrious. The bodies of the middle classes were placed
in the columbaria, which were built up or cut out of rock,
being super-imposed niches. These were often built by joint-stock[Pg 245]
companies who would keep them in order, letting out the
niches as they were wanted. The poor were given a place in
the common burial-ground, their bodies being carried out at
night by the vespillones, carriers of corpses. Persons killed
by lightning were buried at the place they fell, which was enclosed
with a wall. The bodies of malefactors were left unburied,
exposed to the elements and to the birds and the
beasts.

The earlier Romans interred their dead. Burning the body
gradually came into practice and became general near the
close of the republic and almost universal under the empire.
As Christianity grew, cremation gradually fell into disuse
and interment became the practice.

In one way of cremation, perhaps the earlier form, a grave
about three and a half feet deep was made and filled with fuel.
The body was placed on the fuel and as it burned the bones
and ashes of the body fell into the pit with the coal and ashes
of the fuel. The remains of the body were gathered up and
put into an urn which was set up in the grave and the dirt
heaped around so as to form a mound and then a wall was
built around the place.

In another way, a funeral pile, made of wood and in the
form of an altar, was built up outside the city and near the
family burial place. The eyes of the corpse were opened and
it was wrapped in a shroud and laid upon the pile. The nearest
relative impressed a last kiss upon the lips of the deceased
and then with a burning torch and head averted set fire to the
pile, the others present raising a conclamatio. While the pile
was burning there was thrown upon it incense, perfumes,
clothing, ornaments, weapons, and other things, as last presents
to the deceased. When the body was consumed, the fire
was extinguished with wine. The bones and ashes of the body
were collected, dried, sprinkled with perfumes, and put into
an urn, which was placed in a tomb. The last farewell was
spoken, those present were purified with a sprinkling of pure
water, and then all departed.

Relatives and friends came together the day after the funeral
and partook of the funeral feast. If the deceased had
been a great or wealthy man, scenic games were given and
raw meat distributed among the people. The mourning continued
for ten days, during which time none of the relatives
could be summoned to a court of justice. On the ninth day a
banquet was held, bringing the whole family together again,[Pg 246]
and on the tenth day the house was purified and the funeral
ceremonies ended.

"The purification of the house ended the funeral ceremonies,
but the 'paternal Manes' had three festivals which
brought together again families: in March, the three nights of
the Lemuralia, to appease the Manes whom forgetfulness
might irritate; in February, the Parentalia, 'the day of the
dear kindred,' which Ovid calls also the festival of the
Caristies, and in the summer, that of roses, Rosalia, which
were then scattered around the tomb. On this day all the
relations were united at the same table, socias dapes, in order
that the festival might lead to forgetfulness of quarrels: 'This
is the time,' says the poet, 'when concord takes pleasure in
descending among us.'"195


Industries. Agriculture was the most important industry
of the early Romans. The farms were small and many of
the leading citizens followed the calling of farming. Later
there arose large landed estates, which greatly changed the
manner of farming. The proprietors did not work themselves
and most of the work was done by slaves. Large tracts of
land were used for parks and pleasure grounds and others
were kept in pasturage. Thus agriculture decreased or
changed and as the population grew the people of Rome were
no longer able to supply their own food and food-stuffs were
imported from other countries. The time came when immense
supplies of grain were brought in by the government
and distributed free among the people or sold at a nominal
price.

On a great estate the dwelling of the master, the villa
proper, stood apart from the other buildings, which were built
around a court-yard and all were enclosed with only one entrance
which was guarded by a porter with a fierce watch-dog.
The slaves that could be trusted worked out in the fields and
the others were kept within the enclosure, often in underground
chambers, and did indoor work. A great deal of the
farm work was done by hand and for which they had a number
of implements, such as spades, mattocks, rakes, hoes, and
forks. They had different kinds of plows to suit the nature
of the soil. They usually used oxen for plowing.

The Romans understood about fertilizing and drainage and
rotation of crops. It seems they had many different kinds of
grain and practiced both fall and spring sowing. Next in[Pg 247]
importance to the grains were various kinds of pulse, the
most useful being the faba, some variety of bean. They raised
turnips as food for cattle and sheep.

Among the animals raised on the farms were cattle, bred
mostly for draught rather than for beef; horses and mules,
race-horses commanding the highest prices; sheep and goats
and hogs. Poultry-raising was quite important. Doves and
thrushes and peacocks were raised and for which there was
quite a demand. Since honey took the place of sugar, great
attention was given to bee-culture.

Two of the greatest industries were the raising of grapes
for wine and olives for oil. Market-gardening employed quite
a large number and it was quite profitable, especially near
cities and large towns. There were various kinds of fruit-trees
and grafting was a common practice. Beside fruit-trees
other trees were raised, in particular trees for shade and
ornament.

"In considering the Roman farmer's year as a whole, we
find that he computed rainy days and festivals at forty-five
and reckoned on thirty days after the sowing when there was
no field labor to be done. But on these thirty days, and on
the stormy ones, there were ropes to make, baskets to weave,
and other home-made utensils to prepare; while all the other
instruments of the husbandman       his 'mute servants,' as Verro
calls them       had to be repaired and thoroughly cleaned. Even
on feast-days certain kinds of work were allowed, such as the
cleaning of drains and the mending of highways, so that only
the December Saturnalia seem to have afforded a complete
holiday to the slaves.

"On New Year's day, a little work of every kind was done
for good luck; but then followed a time of complete relaxation.
In the latter half of January, the ground was cleared of
brambles, and the trimming of the vineyards completed; while
the autumn-sown grain and the beans, if they were sufficiently
grown, were hoed for the first time. Early trees were now
grafted, and the stock was planted. Vineyards were also cultivated,
and young orchards set out, grass sown and ground
broken, fields manured and osier-beds renewed. Vine-sets
were also transplanted, if needful and the late fruit trees
grafted.

"In March, the vegetable garden was prepared, the autumn
grains received their second hoeing, and the spring grains
were sown. In April, came weeding, sheep-washing, the set[Pg 248]ting
out of new vineyards, the trimming of old vines, and the
olive-grafting.

"May brought the earliest mowing, and in this month the
earth was first spaded up about the olive-trees, and the vineyards
dug over, this latter process being repeated each month
until cold weather. The olives were also trimmed, the vine-shoots
nipped; in warmer latitudes the sheep were shorn, and
the lupins, which had been sown as fertilizers, were ploughed
in. In June the first ploughing was finished and the second
done, the threshing-floor was made ready, vetches mown,
beans picked, and honey taken from the hives.

"Grain-harvest took place in July, and the cutting of the
straw and gathering of leaves for the winter fodder of cattle.
In August, figs and grapes were dried for winter use, and
brakes cut for litter.

"September was, par excellence, the month of the vintage,
and then, too, turnips were planted, and the later grains harvested.
In October, winter grains were sown and harrowed
in, trees trimmed, and the olive-picking begun.

"November was devoted to a general cleaning-up of autumn
work. The making of oil was finished in December, and the
vines trimmed, and we may close the brief résumé of the
work of the Roman agricultural year by a few general precepts
from the natural history of the elder Pliny: 'He is no
farmer who buys what his estate can supply. He is a bad
head of a household who does by day what can be done by
night       except in case of foul weather; he is a worse who does
on working-days what is permitted on holidays; the worst of
all is he who on a pleasant day chooses to work within doors
rather than in the field."196

The upper classes in Rome held in low esteem, and even in
contempt, the tradesmen and mechanics. This might have
been because these people performed for the masses the duties
that slaves did for the higher classes, and so all were put on
the same footing. These people were, with few exceptions, debarred
from serving in the legions and in consequence they
became cowardly and likewise at times unruly. Yet the laboring
class, as everywhere and in all times, were greatly needed
at Rome and did perform a large amount of honest and useful
labor. The great commerce carried on needed a large
number of sailors and in the ports dock hands and porters
and clerks. The city, too, needed a large number in the trades,[Pg 249]
as, bakers, tailors, shoemakers, potters, carpenters, and various
kinds of smiths. There were needed plenty of small shops
where the people could procure the things necessary for life
and such shops would call for the employment of many
people.

People of the same trades would naturally associate together
and attachments would be formed, so that guilds came
into existence at an early date, both from this natural instinct
of association and for the protection of their trades. Among
the crafts represented in the guilds were weavers, carpenters,
dyers, leather-workers, tanners, smiths, porters, and a number
of others. They were modeled after the gens or family, with
a religious center and a patron deity. They had separate
inns for their meetings. They had festive days at which times
they went in procession through the streets carrying their
emblems and banners. They provided for the funerals of
their members, they had their widow's fund, and in other
ways they looked after the interests of the ones belonging to
the guilds.

Rome had an extensive commerce. Traders went along with
the soldiers or quickly followed after them to open trade with
the conquered provinces. Thus London in 61 A.      D., only
eighteen years after the conquest, had a large number of
Roman merchants among its people. The roads built from
Rome into all parts of the world greatly promoted commerce.
The traders did not stop with the boundaries of the empire
but went out among peoples not under Roman sway. As an
instance of this was their going out into the North of Europe
to the Baltic for amber and at one time there was quite a
trade in this and in other articles. Even before Cæsar's conquest
of Gaul, Roman traders had entered it over the St.
Bernhard pass and had even gone among the Belgæ. The
Mediterranean, the Black Sea, and the Atlantic were full of
Roman ships trading with the various provinces and countries.
The conquest of Egypt opened up a great trade, not
only with that country but through it also with Arabia,
Ethiopia and even India.


The Spectacles. The public games, or Spectacles, were the
greatest amusements the Roman people had. Originating in
early times as religious celebrations, they became so fixed as
to make them a public necessity, a means of keeping the mass
of the people busy so as to keep their attention away from
affairs of state. As it became a duty of the government to[Pg 250]
provide grain free or at a nominal cost, so it became its duty
to furnish free entertainment for the masses. These games
were provided by the officials and made free to the public.
There were four phases of the spectacles. Horse and chariot
races were held in the circus, gladiatorial fights and fights
with animals and also sea fights in the amphitheater, scenic
representations in the theater, and athletic and musical contests
in the stadium.

The Circus Maximus was located in Rome in the valley between
the Palatine and Aventine hills. It was of an oblong
circular form, about a mile in circumference, and seated
150,000 or more people. Among the displays were exploits
on horseback, such as leaping from horse to horse while running,
picking up things from the ground with the horse in
full gallop, and the like. Young men in full armor gave
mock-fights, and sometimes there would be military drills, and
again boys from senatorial families and young princes went
through cavalry exercises in glittering armor. The greatest
displays of all were the chariot races. Factions arose with
their colors, at first but two with white and red, and then four
with white, red, blue, green, and later gold and purple were
added but soon dropped out, leaving the four factions and
colors. Heavy bets were made by the factions and there were
fierce contests and often fights between them. Sometimes two
chariots raced, usually four, and again at times six, and there
were two or four horses to each chariot, rarely three. The
victor in the race was crowned and received a cash prize and
his was greeted with great applause.

The amphitheater was an elliptical building with an arena
in the center and with tiers of seats leading up all around.
The Coliseum at Rome was the greatest of all, being computed
to have contained 87,000 seats. In the amphitheater were held
the gladiatorial fights. Just how these originated is unknown
but the first public exhibition of gladiators at Rome was given
in 264 B.      C., by the brothers Marcus and Decimus Brutus at
their father's funeral. Such continued at funerals and then
they were given at other times, the number of days and
number of fighters gradually increasing, till Trajan, upon
his return after a victorious campaign on the Danube, gave
gladiatorial games for 123 days, in which 10,000 fighters
took part. The gladiators were captives, slaves, and criminals,
and under the empire knights and senators and even women
were enrolled among them. There were schools for the train[Pg 251]ing
of gladiators. Emperors, senators, and all classes of
people attended these fights and although women at first
were excluded, later they were admitted freely. The gladiators
wore helmets and had leather coverings for their legs and
they carried shields. Their weapons were the lance, dagger,
sword, and rapier. There were others who used the trident
and the net for entangling their opponents. They were usually
matched by pairs and when one was overcome his life
depended upon the people, who would turn down their thumbs
for his life to be spared and upon the turning up of their
thumbs the wounded gladiator was slain by his opponent. The
victor received a palm crown, sometimes money, and he might
be given his freedom.

"These gladiatorial exhibitions proclaim the true nature of
the Roman character. When the vestal virgin, the Roman
matron, and the young lady could find amusement in such
scenes of human slaughter, it can certainly surprise no one
that the Roman character, in its constituent elements, possessed
so much hardihood, and could remain such firm proof
against every tender feeling of humanity. The school of
blood in which the young were reared, and the old matured,
was eminently calculated to form precisely the character
which the Roman possessed. It is thus that the manners and
customs of a people are influenced by, and in their turn, influence
the character from which they originate."197

Another great amusement of the Romans was the venatio,
or exhibit of wild animals. The first known display of wild
animals at Rome was given by Marcus Fulvius Nobilior, the
conqueror of Ætolia, in 186 B.      C., eighty years after the first
gladiatorial exhibit. These displays grew until all parts of
the world were searched to find animals. There were bears,
elephants, deer, hares, stags, boars, bulls, crocodiles, hippopotamuses,
rhinoceroses, lynxes, apes, giraffes, tigers, ostriches,
hyenas. They were made to fight with one another. They
were starved to make them fierce with hunger and then driven
into the arena against one another with whips, pricked with
lances, burnt with hot irons, and in other ways tormented to
make them extremely angry. There were also fights between
men and beasts. These were often captives and criminals
compelled to fight, but there were others, bestiarii, who were
trained, as the gladiators, in schools to fight against animals.
These men sometimes were assisted by dogs trained to hunt[Pg 252]
and to fight wild animals. In some exhibits, captives and
criminals were bound to stakes and animals set upon them or
they were sent unarmed or poorly armed against the wild
animals. There were, too, exhibits of trained animals and
animal-training became a regular profession under Augustus.

Another form of the spectacle for the entertainment of the
Roman public was the naumachia, or naval battle. As in the
other contests, usually the combatants were captives and criminals.
These were held in the amphitheater, in which case
the arena was flooded with water, or great ponds were dug for
the purpose. The first naval battle on a large scale was given
by Julius Cæsar in 46 B.      C., the two sides having biremes, triremes,
and quadriremes, with 1,000 marines and 2,000 oarsmen
on each side. Claudius in 52 A.      D. gave a naval contest
in which there were 100 triremes and quadriremes and 19,000
warriors and oarsmen. Other large naumachiæ were produced
by Augustus, Nero, Titus, and Domitian. In these conflicts
real fighting took place and large numbers were killed.

There were no theatrical entertainments in the early times
of Rome. In 364 B.      C., during a plague which could not be
stopped, to appease the wrath of the gods scenic performances
were first introduced into Rome. Actors from Etruria
were brought to Rome, who gave mimic dances to the accompaniment
of a flute. For a long time there were no
theaters erected at Rome, a temporary wooden stage being
erected for the occasion. Later wooden theaters were built
and then torn down after the performances were over, being
used but one time. The first stone theater was built on the
Campus Martius in 55 B.      C. by Pompey, and which was large
enough to hold 40,000 people. Comedies, tragedies, and pantomimes
were given. Tragedy was never popular with the
masses as they were too much used to seeing real tragedies
enacted in the arena for any great impression to be made
upon them by the imitations of the stage. Pantomime attained
to the most significance of all performances upon the
Roman stage and especially under the empire. The professional
actors were mostly slaves and freedmen or natives of
other countries, as there was a prejudice against the profession
in Rome. Noted actors were paid high fees for their performances.
Many of the most famous actors belonged to the
imperial households.

The last of the great spectacles were the athletic, literary
and musical contests. These contests were not common under[Pg 253]
the republic but they grew on the people till they became popular
under the empire. Athletic contests were first introduced
into Rome at the same time as the exhibit of wild animals and
by the same person, in 186 B.      C., by Marcus Fulvius Nobilior,
who brought athletes from Greece for the purpose. These
contests continued to be given and they increased in popularity
till a stadium for them was built in 28 B.      C. on the
Campus Martius and the demand from the people became so
great that the officials who provided the state games included
athletic contests with the other games. The Capitoline Agon
was instituted by Domitian in 86 A.      D., and it took rank with
the Olympian. For these contests he built a stadium large
enough to accommodate 30,000 or more spectators. There
were contests in oratory and poetry, in music, and in athletics.
The oratorical contests ceased in later times, but those
in poetry increased in importance and the most talented poets
in the empire competed for the prize of oak-wreath, bestowed
by the emperor upon the winner after the decision of the
judges. The gymnastic contests for men and boys were the
same as in Greece. The Spartan custom of races for girls
was introduced but soon discontinued because of the feeling
against it.


Other Amusements. Among the sports of the Romans was
that of hunting. They kept parks for this purpose and they
also hunted in fields and forests. They used dogs in hunting
and they were trained for hunting various kinds of animals,
as, the lion, the bear, the stag, the hare, and the like. Boar-hunting
was one of their most common pastimes. They had
hawks and other birds of prey trained for hunting. Fishing
was another sport and they made use of rod and line and net.
In winter when the water was frozen over they would cut
holes through the ice for fishing. They had large fish-ponds
on their country estates.

Walking was used as a means of exercise and as a pastime.
This was done in the open air and also there were covered
walks built at different places and in particular about the
Campus Martius and the Forum. There were also places provided
for horseback riding and for pleasure driving in vehicles.

There was a game similar to chess in which the chess men
were glass, ivory or metal colored. Dice were in great use
and gambling with dice prospered in spite of laws against it.
Under the empire there arose an entertainment similar to a[Pg 254]
lottery, in which tickets were distributed free to the guests or
sold to them and a drawing was made for the prizes. At their
banquets and elsewhere the guests were entertained with
musicians, mimics, dancers, jugglers, acrobats, rope-dancers,
and other kinds of performers.


The Bath. The Romans in early times took their baths in
the Tiber. Later, the lavatrina, or washhouse, connected with
the kitchen by a heating apparatus, served as a bathroom. In
those days they bathed only for health and cleanliness.
Under the empire, bathing became a fashion and it was carried
to excess. When the supply of water became abundant by
means of the aqueducts, baths multiplied rapidly and public
baths were established. The public baths were at first arranged
for and used only by the common people, but their importance
grew gradually until all classes used the public
baths and they were enlarged and beautified and different
kinds of baths provided, as, hot, tepid, cold, and shower. The
usual time for the bath was in the afternoon shortly before
the evening meal. It also became the custom to take a bath
after the meal and then the number was often increased till
the bath was taken seven or more times during the day and
evening.

The thermæ, baths, at Rome, under the empire, covered
large spaces, with magnificent structures adorned with paintings
and sculptures, the walls lined inside with marble, with
marble columns, and silver mouthpieces for the water pipes.
There were rooms not only for bathing, but also large halls
for swimming, and rooms for places of meeting for conversation,
for listening to the reading of poems by their authors,
for gymnastic exercises, and the like, and provided with libraries
and museums. Thus these thermæ became centers for
gatherings of various kinds and places of amusement.


Games and Plays. Children in Rome played a great deal,
just as do children everywhere. They had their dolls and
hobby-horses and toy-houses. They played with carts and
used them very much as the children of the present. They
skipped stones and walked upon stilts and spun tops. They
used nuts for playing a number of games, one being called
ludus castellorum, in which three nuts were to be so arranged
that a fourth nut could be placed upon them without displacing
them, the winner receiving all the four nuts. They
played par impar, odd or even. The boys and even sometimes
the young men would roll a large iron hoop, which had iron[Pg 255]
or brass rings fastened around it and kept up quite a clatter
while the hoop was rolling. Some of these hoops were five or
six feet in diameter and required quite a little skill to roll
them, being rolled and guided by means of an iron rod.

Ball was a game especially liked by the boys and young
men of Rome. There were three kinds of balls used       a large
hollow ball, a small hollow ball, and a ball stuffed with feathers.
At the country villas about Rome there was usually a
place for ball-playing. The boys used the streets and squares
of Rome for ball-playing, particularly before the butchers'
shops in the Forum Romanum. They played ball alone or
with a few or with many. In one game the ball was thrown
up into the air and all tried to catch it. The trigon, or pila
trigonalis, was a favorite way of playing ball, the players
being placed in a triangle and they were to fling the ball at
one another, the one failing to catch it and return it being the
loser. There was a game in which they would choose sides
and have the ground marked out as for lawn-tennis.


Religion. The Romans were of a deeply religious nature
even down into the times of the empire. Religion entered into
the life of the Romans in a practical way and touched upon
the civic duties and social relations, as the events of life were
held to be of a sacred nature. The Roman life was closely
connected with religion, as every activity of life was presided
over by a deity, whom it was necessary to worship properly
in order that the activity might prove successful.

The child came in contact with religion at his very earliest
life in the home in the worship of the household gods, the
Penates and Lares, the former being the gods of the hearth,
who guarded the stores and provisions of the family, and the
latter were the spirits of departed ancestors, who were the
protectors of the family. In the atrium was the image of the
chief lar between two penates, to whom were offered sacrifices
each morning by the father as priest, and birthdays and marriages
and the putting on of the toga virilis by the boy and
the return of a member of the family after a long absence were
occasions of special religious exercises. The young people,
too, were led further into religion as the gens and the state
carried on similar sacrifices and ceremonies for the common
good, for the state had its common hearth, presided over by
the Vestal Virgins, who guarded the sacred fire upon the
altar, which symbolized the home.


Vestal Virgins. In Rome was a worship in which was[Pg 256]
preserved a common hearth, having always burning on it the
domestic fire of the whole nation. This was in the temple of
Vesta, the goddess of the home. The goddess being herself
a virgin, it was considered necessary that this fire should be
cared for by virgins.

This temple of Vesta went through a purification on June
first of each year and a renewal of the fire was made on March
first. In case the fire went out it was kindled again by the
rubbing together of two pieces of "lucky wood," thus producing
a fire, and in later times by use of a concave mirror
to focus the sun's rays. This was the most sacred of all worship
at Rome and the letting this fire go out was considered
a great evil, as this was emblematic of the state and its extinction
meant the extinction of the nation, hence the Virgin who,
through carelessness or negligence, permitted this was severely
scourged in the dark by the pontifex.

There were six Vestal Virgins. When chosen, the girl was
not to be younger than six nor older than ten; she was to be
the daughter of freeborn parents, alive at the time of her selection
and residing in Italy, and not engaged in any dishonorable
calling; she was to be free from mental and physical
defects.

At the time of the admission of a Vestal, her hair was
cut off, and a very solemn ceremony was gone through with,
after which she was dressed in white and admitted to the
work of the Virgins. It appears that her hair was allowed to
grow again and to be worn long. Her dress was always white
and she wore round her forehead a broad band which had
ribbons fastened to it. In processions and at sacrifices she
wore a white veil, buckled under the chin.

The term of service was thirty years, the Vestal being a
novice during the first ten years, an active priestess the second
ten, and a teacher of novices the remaining period. At the
end of the term of service of thirty years, the vestal could
go back to her family and even get married, but most of them
remained in the service of the goddess.

The Virgins had four important duties to perform: (1)
Tending the sacred fires; (2) Bringing water daily from the
sacred spring, for ceremonial sprinkling and sweeping; (3)
Offering sacrifices of salt and cakes, and pouring libations of
wine and oil on the sacred fire; (4) Guarding the seven sacred
objects on which the stability of Roman power was supposed
to stand, the chief of these being the Palladium.[Pg 257]

The Vestals were very jealously guarded. Death was inflicted
on any one committing an offense against one of them.
No man was allowed to go near the temple of Vesta at night
nor at any time permitted to enter the dwelling of these
Virgins. If a breach of chastity occurred on the part of one
of them, she was severely punished by being cruelly beaten
and then buried alive. The one sharing her disgrace met a
violent death. Twelve Vestals were so punished.

The privileges of a Vestal were very great. She was entirely
free from the control of her parents; she could make a
will; could give evidence without taking an oath; had the
seat of honor at banquets and games; one who was convicted
of a crime, if he accidentally met her, was given his liberty.
She was treated with the utmost respect and reverence; a
consul meeting her on the street, always made way for her;
and all the people gave great homage to her. In all the
troublesome times between patricians and plebeians neither
party disturbed the Vestal Virgins but on the contrary greatly
respected them.


Education. As long as Rome was in its full strength, education
was wholly of a practical nature, its aim being to prepare
its young that in manhood they might be of most service
to the state. It was more of the Spartan idea than the
Athenian, but unlike Sparta the Roman state did not undertake
the education of the young but left that wholly to the
home, and it was not till the time of the empire that education
was taken up by the state, for before that time the state did
not even assist in education, let alone control it. Although
the state did not concern itself with education, yet love of
country and obedience to its laws were so instilled into the
minds of the young that no other nation has ever got its citizens
to quite so high a pitch of patriotism as the Roman
people reached under the republic. As conquest grew and
wealth increased under the empire, the Romans came more
and more under the influence of Greece until Greek methods
and models and ideals dominated Roman education.

In the early times of Rome there were probably no public
schools, education being wholly in the hands of the parents.
The early years of the child were under the mother, and he
received his training from her. These early years of the child
could not have been passed better than under the care and
training of the old Roman mother, for she was a woman of
purity and dignity and industry, qualities fitted for the train[Pg 258]ing
of the child's younger years. As the boy grew older he
would be permitted to be in the atrium of a morning when
his father received his clients and so the boy would receive
training in custom and law as he would hear the counsel given
by his father to the clients. The boy would also gain much
from the discussions of the men at the banquets and other
gatherings as he would attend with his father. The child of
these times did not learn through instruction so much as by
informal training and in imitation of his elders.

Reading and writing were taught to the boy by the father
and also simple calculations, such as would be needed in
everyday affairs. Ballads, national songs, and religious hymns
and deeds of the men of the past were learned by the Roman
boys. Physical training of the boys came mostly through
games while the young men practised gymnastic exercises,
but only to prepare them for military life. Such training
made warriors and loyal citizens but also made these Romans
selfish, overbearing, cruel, and rapacious, without lofty ideals
or enthusiasm for the higher things of life.

Literary education may have said to have begun at Rome
during the third century before Christ. In 260 B.      C., according
to Plutarch, a school was opened by Spurius Carvilius
at which fees were charged, the first of the kind. This man
was a freedman and he had been a domestic tutor to the
consul of the same name, Spurius Carvilius, who, as mentioned
before, was the first man at Rome to divorce his wife. From
this time education increased and there became three kinds
of schools       elementary, grammar, and a higher school, the
rhetor's school. The first was presided over by the litterator,
or ludus magister; the second by the literatus, or, grammaticus;
and the third by the rhetor. Added to these kinds
of schools were those of the various philosophies, which were
given to the adherents in form of lectures. The child
entered the elementary school at about the seventh year of
age. Near his twelfth year he went into the grammar school
and at fifteen or sixteen, if he had determined on politics or
law, he would enter the rhetor's school.

As stated above, the child entered school at about seven
years of age. The term ludus was used to designate the elementary
school and schola the higher school. In the elementary
schools, reading, writing, and arithmetic of a very elementary
nature were taught. In learning to read, the child
was first taught his letters and then syllables, which were fol[Pg 259]lowed
by words and then came the sentences. At the first of
the elementary schools the reading was taught by means of
exercises given by the teacher on account of the scarcity of
books. But during the second century before Christ large
numbers of slaves were put to copying books so that from this
time there were plenty of copies to be had at reasonable cost,
and no doubt each child had his own reading book, which
contained, perhaps, a Latin version of the Odyssey and the
standard Latin poets. Special attention was given to correct
pronunciation and intelligent expression. After the child had
learned to read he was then taught to write. In the beginning
the teacher would make the letters with a stylus on a waxen
tablet and then he would give the stylus to the child to trace
the letters, the teacher guiding the child's hand. In arithmetic
but simple calculations were taught in the elementary
schools, the children learning to count and to calculate on the
fingers or by means of pebbles and after using these means till
they gained some facility an abacus with pebbles was used.
Also the waxen tablet with the stylus was used for calculation.

It is quite probable that for a large number of the children
school education ceased with the end of the training in the
elementary schools. At twelve years of age the boy who went
on with his education entered the grammar school. There
were two kinds of these schools       the Greek and the Latin.
In the Greek schools the language used was Greek with Greek
literature and methods of instruction, and at first the teachers
were Greek. The Latin schools differed in that the language
used was Latin and while at first the literature was Greek
translated into Latin later there was a Latin literature. Too,
the Latin schools laid more stress upon the practical side of
the work rather than the theoretical. The head of each
grammar school determined what the curriculum should be
but these were quite uniform after all, as all were striving
for the same end. The principal studies were grammar and
literature, but also were included mathematics, geography,
history, and music.

In the study of grammar there were studied the divisions
of the letters into vowels and consonants with the divisions of
the vowels, the sounds of the letters or phonics, philology in
a simple way, the parts of speech, the inflections of the parts
of speech, and the like. In literature in the Greek schools, the
study of Homer took the leading part as did the study of[Pg 260]
Vergil in the Latin schools, and also other authors were
studied. Geometry was studied along the practical lines of
mensuration and astronomy. Likewise geography and history
were entered into for practical purposes. Music was
taken up to aid in getting proper intonation and rhythm in
oratory and for learning the religious chants. There was but
little training in gymnastics, only for hygienic purposes and
as an aid to military training. Dancing was not taught in
the schools but in the home. This was not as with us, but
more of the form of calisthenics. There was nothing such as
the round dance with us, which would have been thought
shockingly vulgar by the Romans.

When the youth, at about sixteen years of age, assumed the
toga virilis, his further education depended upon what his
life's work was to be. If it was to be war, then he at once
entered the army. If he was to enter public life, then he attended
the rhetorical school and studied oratory and law.
Also he frequented the places where he could hear the public
orations and he might have attached himself to some orator
or jurist.

In the rhetor's school those things were studied which
would help the young man in his public career. Oratory and
rhetoric were the leading studies, and, as he sought, too, to
gain a wide knowledge, mathematics, philosophy, law, and
literature would be included in the course. The youth usually
remained in these higher schools for two or three years. Then
he might go on with his studies through travel and attendance
at centers outside of Rome.

"Youths of higher intellectual ambition did not rest satisfied
with the instruction obtainable at Rome, but (at least
after 80 B.      C.) resorted to Athens and other philosophical
and rhetorical centers. In the last decade of the Republic
there were many famous schools of this higher class. In addition
to Athens, the mother city, we have the great university
schools of Rhodes, Apollonia, Mitylene, Alexandria, Tarsus,
Pergamus, and afterwards, in imperial times, Smyrna and
Ephesus. In the time of Cicero Marseilles also was already a
widely known school."198

The elementary schools were poorly provided for, as they
were not held in regular school houses for there were no buildings
for such educational purposes. The school-rooms were
sometimes on the street or in the market-place, wherever a[Pg 261]
quiet, convenient corner was found; they were, too, in sheds
or booths in front of a house like a lean-to; again they were in
places similar to a veranda of a house. If the school-room was
the street, the children sat on the stones; in buildings, they sat
on the floor, or they might have had benches. The grammar
schools were better cared for, as they were generally in covered
places attached to large buildings and opening on the
street. They had benches for the children and the teacher sat
on a chair on a raised place. There were often placed in
grammar schools sculptures of marble or plaster and also
paintings. All school-rooms were open to the public and frequently
the parents and friends went in to see the work and
at times there were great "speech days."

The pedagogue was used in Rome, as in Greece, to have
charge of the boy and to accompany him to and from school.
Although the Romans used the Greek term pedagogue, yet the
Latin terms custos, guardian, and pedisequus, attendant,
were, perhaps, most commonly used and, too, were used comes,
companion, and rector, governor. The Romans were more
careful in the selection of a slave for pedagogue than were the
Greeks, and yet he was too often too old or too much physically
disabled for the best performance of his duties. These slaves
often were manumitted when their duties were completed in a
satisfactory manner.

The elementary teacher, litterator, was usually a slave or
freedman, and too often quite ignorant, in consequence these
teachers were held in little esteem and almost with contempt.
Although the grammaticus was better educated and received
more esteem yet he did not have a high standing. It was only
the rhetor who was respected and praised in Rome. The elementary
teacher received very poor pay and the grammar
teacher did not fare much better. Yet in later times the
grammaticus and rhetor were both well paid and there were
some who even became wealthy.

The school year, at least for the elementary schools and
probably, also, for the grammar schools, consisted of eight
months, with a vacation from July to October inclusive. There
was a holiday in whole or in part every eighth day, market
day, and there were numerous other holidays throughout the
school year. The school day began at daylight, often before,
and continued till evening, with a recess for dinner. There
were, however, no home lessons.

The discipline at school was very severe. The ferule, whip,[Pg 262]
strap, and rod were very liberally used. There must have
been quite a good deal of such punishment, as many wrote
protests against it, Quintilian, perhaps, most of all.

"Roman boys, like boys in our times, occasionally shirked
school, or contrived to feign illness in order to avoid reciting
their lessons. The master hung up, where all might read it,
a board with names of pupils who absented themselves or had
run away. Persius tells us that when a boy he used to rub
his eyes with olive oil to give him the appearance of illness,
though how oil would have that effect is not apparent. Pliny
says that school children took cumin to make them pale."199

In the early days the education of the girls was for the
most part that gained from the mother in the home. They
were taught spinning and weaving and sewing and other
household arts, and, no doubt, they also learned to read and
write, the same as the boys. When education became common,
girls had about the same studies as the boys but whether they
attended the same schools with the boys is a disputed question.
It is, perhaps, true that the girls of the common people attended
the elementary schools with the boys, while the girls
of the higher classes had tutors at home. It was more difficult
for women to get higher education as they must have obtained
it through private instruction and possibly, after marriage,
from their husbands.

CHAPTER XI

THE CHILD IN EARLIER AND MEDIEVAL EUROPE



Historical and Critical. We come now to a time in Europe
when there is an overturning of the greatest nation, perhaps,
that has ever arisen in this world and with the highest civilization
the world had reached up to its time and we enter upon
a period where barbarians rule and where civilization lies
stagnant for a long number of years. The question ever
arises why these great civilizations should be overthrown and
pass away as it would seem with their preservation the world
would go on toward higher progress and better living while
their tearing down leaves the world in ignorance and darkness
till another civilization gradually arises.

Yet the very fact that these civilizations are overthrown
would imply that the people themselves are weakened or else
they could not be overcome. So it would seem that the nation
has reached a place where it no longer can prove most useful
to the people composing it or to the people of the world, and
it must be overthrown and caused to cease to exist in order
that new, fresh elements may be allowed to enter into the life
of the people that stagnation may not come upon the whole
race of people.

The old Romans disappear and a new race enters upon
world activity, a race of barbarians, and not only a new people
but likewise a youthful people, which must promise much for
the race. But this new people begins at quite a lower plane of
civilization than the old nations of Greece and Rome had
reached and so there is entered upon a long, slow upward
climbing but there is a civilization attained that not only
reached to that of Greece and Rome but even surpassed these
nations and it is still going upward.

It would seem that it does a world good at times to slow
down and even to lie dormant for in the end it will surpass its
former self. Humanity is the same always and the dominant
traits, though they may be checked and held passive for a
long time, in the end will show themselves, strengthened by[Pg 265]
the rest. The best things that a nation produces are not lost
in the nation's passing away for the conquering people will in
a slow way absorb and work over the essentials and they will
come forth among the new people all the better and stronger
for race progress. What if the time be long and the regeneration
slow, the world can pass away its time in no better way
than in getting ready for progress and it has plenty of time
for such.

"The larger part of all that the ancient world had gained
seemed to be lost. But it was so in appearance only. Almost,
if not quite, every achievement of the Greeks and the Romans
in thought, in science, in law, in the practical arts, is now a
part of our civilization, either among the tools of our daily
life or in the long-forgotten or perhaps disowned foundation-stones
which have disappeared from sight because we have
built some more complete structure upon them, a structure
which never could have been built, however, had not these
foundations first been laid by some one. All of real value
which had been gained was to be preserved in the world's permanent
civilization. For the moment it seemed lost, but it
was only for the moment, and in the end the recovery was to
be complete. By a long process of education, by its own natural
growth, under the influence of the remains of the ancient
civilization, by no means small or unimportant, which worked
effectively from the very first, by widening experience and
outside stimulus, the barbarian society which resulted from
the conquest was at last brought up to a level from which it
could comprehend the classic civilization, at least to a point
to see that it had very much still to learn from the ancients,
and then, with an enthusiasm which the race has rarely felt,
it made itself master in a generation or two of all that it had
not known of the classic work       of its thought and art and
science       and from the beginning thus secured, advanced to
the still more marvelous achievements of modern times."200


Feudalism. Feudalism was a form of society and government
which arose during the Middle Ages and became one
of the great institutions of that time, whose legal principles
and social ideals are still prevalent in the fundamentals of
law and society of the present. "It is itself a crude and
barbarous form of government in which the political organization
is based on the tenure of land; that is, the public
duties and obligations, which ordinarily the citizen owes to[Pg 266]
the state, are turned into private and personal services which
he owes to his lord in return for land which he has received
from him."201 The feudal system was not confined to Europe,
for it existed as well in Japan and in Central Africa and
among the Mohammedans, for if the conditions that underlie
this system arise then human nature, whatever the place or
time, is likely to take on this form of government.

The feudal system grew up from the conditions of society
of the time, which caused the people to organize themselves
about earlier institutions whose remains still existed among
them. In Rome there had grown up a system where the
great man had clients attached to him, who consulted him,
who helped him and in turn were helped and directed by him.
This system must have somewhat been taken up by the conquerors
and carried through the years in a modified form,
so that when there was no longer a strong central power
able to care for the people as a whole, it was natural for
them to turn to the strong men about them and to attach
themselves to the ones who could bestow upon them land to
hold in tenure and likewise who was strong enough to protect
them in the use of this land or of their own land. The
constituent elements of feudalism were those referring to land
and its tenure and to the relations which existed between the
protector and the one protected, or, vassalage, beneficies, and
immunities.

The term vassal was originally applied to servants not free,
but it gradually grew to mean a free man and a vassal was
of the same condition as his lord, so that the term held an
honorable meaning. The relation of the vassal to the lord
was that of homage and fealty. There were two parts to the
ceremony of vassalage. In the first ceremony, the man
kneeled before the lord, laid his hands in those of the lord,
and promised homage to him, upon which the lord lifted him
up and gave him the kiss of peace. In the second ceremony,
an oath of fealty to the lord was taken upon the Gospels or
upon some relic or relics of saints. At the time of this ceremony
the lord performed the ceremony of investiture, when
he handed to the vassal some material object to symbolize
that the man was invested with a fief. The vassal owed to
his lord military, civil, and financial duties. He had to give
military service for a certain length of time each year, usually
forty days, at his own expense, which, if continued, was at[Pg 267]
the expense of the lord. The vassal was bound to attend the
court of his lord and to aid him in administering justice.
In cases where the lord was taken prisoner in war and a
ransom was demanded or his son was knighted or his eldest
daughter married, or if he went to the Crusades, the vassal
was to give financial aid. The lord owed the obligation to
his vassal to support him in his fief and to defend him against
every enemy.

On the death of the lord the inheritance passed to his
children. At first only male heirs could inherit lands, but
later the daughter shared with the son all the privileges of
succession except that of primogeniture.

The benefices were bestowed by the lord upon the vassal,
the land to be held by tenure, and thus the vassal was placed
under obligation to the lord. There were some lands that
were held freely and not by tenure, such being known as
allodial lands, but these freeholds decreased until finally they
wholly disappeared and all the land was held by tenure.

The immunities were grants of privileges to churches or to
private individuals. These included the exemption from certain
dues or certain obligations.

In his domain the lord was a kind of sovereign. He administered
justice, levied taxes, coined money, and declared
war for himself and for his own benefit. The revenues of
the lord were of various kinds. He received a certain part
of the crops from his vassals and he received the judicial
fees and other fees of various kinds. Property left after
death where there were no heirs went to him.


The Feudal Castle and Its Life. As has been stated, when
the central power became weak and no longer able to protect
the common people, they began to cluster about strong men
for protection. These men occupied places that could be defended
or else they sought out places of strength and security,
usually, heights and places which were difficult of access.
Here they built castles and fortified them. These were at
first wood, making a kind of wooden blockhouse, but gradually
stone came to be used and they were built exceedingly
strong, and often considered impregnable.

The feudal village lay beneath and about the castle. There
was a complete social separation between the life in the castle
and that in the village surrounding it. They pursued a
different life, as the lord and his retainers were engaged in
war or the chase or lived in idleness, while the people of the[Pg 268]
village were laborers. There became a wide separation between
the village and the castle and special privileges grew
up about the dwellers of the castle and, through inheritance,
a nobility arose that lived in idleness and came to looking
down upon and really despising the common people.

This isolation of the castle did, though, bring a closer relation
between the members composing its family. However
much the lord might go out for war or for adventure, in the
end he must return to his castle, as it was his home. Here
he found his wife and children, with whom he must spend
his time, mostly alone with them, so that close relations grew.
When the lord was away from the castle, his wife must,
naturally, have had charge of affairs and this would produce
in her characteristics which would cause her to be respected
by her lord and often to be considered his equal. It thus
arose that domestic life came to mean much in that time and
the family became the center of social relationship. The importance
of the woman increased and the value of wife and
mother became to be recognized beyond what had been known
up to that time.


Chivalry. Chivalry arose in the Middle Ages, reaching its
height during the Crusades. It constituted the moral and social
law and custom of the ruling classes in Europe between
the eleventh and sixteenth centuries. It grew out of old
Teutonic customs, was modified by the feudal system, and
brought into existence a distinction between men of noble
rank and the common people about them. The chivalric person
was expected to devote himself to the service of God, to
his feudal lord, and to his lady. The knight was trained to
service and obedience. He was to give his services to the
weak, especially of his own rank, to give himself over to the
protection of the church, to be reverent and obedient to his
superiors, and to hold womankind in high esteem.

In the training of a knight, the boy remained at home till
his seventh or eighth year under the care of his mother, who
began his religious education and gave him his early training
in respect and obedience to his superiors. He was then placed
under the care of some nobleman or churchman, in whose
castle he lived and took his place with the members of the
household. He was known as a page and he waited upon
his lord and lady. He learned to play chess and other games
and in most cases to play the harp and to sing and likewise[Pg 269]
to read and write. He was trained in running, wrestling,
boxing, and riding and some knightly exercises that went
with the riding. At fourteen or fifteen the youth became a
squire and entered into more intimate relations with the
knight and his lady. With other squires he played chess and
walked and hunted with the lady of the castle, and they attended
to the personal wants of the knight, such as caring
for his bed, helping him to dress, grooming his horse, and
attending upon him at the tournament and in war. During
this time the youth learned the arts of war       to exercise in
armor, to ride and to use the shield, and to handle the sword
and lance and battle-axe. As he neared the end of his squireship,
the young man chose his lady-love, to whom he was ever
to be devoted. She was usually older than he and often
married and he was expected to remain devoted to her even
though he should marry.

At twenty-one the young man became a knight, after the
ceremony of knighthood. When the time for the ceremony
arrived, the candidate put in a season of fasting and purification
and prayer, and then he passed the night in a church
in prayer and meditation. In the morning came the confession
and the absolution and the eucharist. He then placed
his sword upon the altar, the priest blessed it and returned
it to him, after he had taken the solemn oath of knighthood.
His armor was placed upon him and his sword buckled about
him and then he knelt before his lord, who laid his sword
upon the candidate's shoulder and dubbed him knight. The
new knight then arose and mounted his horse and displayed
his skill and strength in handling his horse and in the use
of his weapons.

The knight's great occupation was that of war. For this
he lived and for this he trained throughout life. For practical
training in war the tournament came into existence,
wherein there were actual combats waged with the weapons
of war, and when there were good numbers on each side it
became a real battle, even to the wounding and killing. This
gave opportunity for displaying knightly powers and courage,
for gaining the smiles and good-will of the ladies, and
likewise for the settling of private quarrels. The tournament,
too, was the greatest of all amusements during feudal times
and brought together the largest gatherings and the greatest
displays. Fairs were held in connection with them in which[Pg 270]
there was great merry-making, where jugglers and strolling
players and musicians found place and drunkenness and gambling
and the like prevailed.

A level piece of ground was chosen on which an oval enclosure
was made, with rows of seats and covered galleries
all round. The knights who were to engage in the fights
pitched their tents at either end, where they stationed themselves
with their squires. Heralds had charge of affairs and
arranged the ceremonies and rules of procedure. There were
jousts, in which two opponents met one another on horseback
with lances, and after the jousts was a general fray, in which
there were a number of champions on each side who fought
with swords and sometimes even with battle-axes, usually on
horseback, but on some occasions some on horse and some
on foot. The evening before the tournament there was a try-out
of arms of squires and young knights, blunt weapons
being used, the winners being allowed to enter the general
fray of the next day.

All being ready, the lists were cleared and the two knights,
on horseback with lances, were placed at some distance opposite
each other. At a signal from the herald they lowered
their lances and rushed at each other, each striving to knock
the other from his horse. In case both knights kept their
seats unhurt, they tried it again, till one or both were unhorsed.
Then they fought on foot with swords till one was
overcome. At the close of all the jousts the general fray
took place. In the jousts sometimes one or the other knight
was badly wounded and sometimes even killed. In the general
fray the fight might have become so fierce that a number
would be wounded and killed on both sides. In the evening
after the close of the tournament a great feast was held,
which was attended by the ladies and the knights who participated
in the tournament and other members of the nobility.

The mounted knight was a great fighter and could overcome
quite a number of unarmed and unarmored peasants.
As long as fighting was done at close quarters no other fighter
could equal him or expect to overcome him. But when the
common people began to be armed with the bow and the pike
an army could be raised that did not always have to fight at
close quarters and so armor did not mean so much. War, too,
was becoming a mercenary trade and a king could obtain an
army by paying for mercenary cavalry and by arming his[Pg 271]
yeomen and peasants and forming them into pliant infantry.
While the barons wasted their strength in fighting and robbing
one another, the king swept down upon them with his
army of infantry and mercenary cavalry and defeated them
one by one, thus doing away with petty baronies and their
private quarrels and uniting them under one strong power.
When gunpowder came into general use, the knight and his
armor vanished in smoke and the chivalry of the middle ages
passed away and through the transforming influences of the
printing press and steam power and the many other arts of
modern times it was refined, and became the basis of the
civilization of the present day. Chivalry is still extant, but
it has a different meaning than that of feudal times, for where
the feudal system had its knight the present age has its gentleman.

The age of chivalry most naturally aroused poetic and
musical fancies and during that time arose the trouveurs of
Northern France, with whom may be placed the minstrels of
the British Isles, and the troubadours of Southern France and
the minnesingers of Germany. These poets and singers were
from all classes       nobility, artisans, clergy       and although
most of them were of noble rank, yet there were some noted
ones from the common people. They would go about the
country reciting and singing their poems and they were welcome
everywhere. They would sing of war and of love, many
of the productions being based upon heroes of the past and
again others being of imaginary characters.


The Peasantry. During feudal times there arose a great
distinction between noble and ignoble service. The noble
service was that performed by the knight in armor on
horseback, that of the unpaid warrior, while ignoble service
was that of the field laborer. Since feudal life was mainly
agricultural, the artisan, the dweller in the town, counted
but little, but there came a time when he did count much
for the overthrow of feudalism. The mass of the laboring
people were serfs and they were treated sternly by their
masters, the noblemen, and they were not much more than
slaves.

Slavery, so prominent under the Roman rule, gradually
disappeared during the middle ages. Yet the serf at first
was but little better off, for, although he could not be sold,
he could not leave the land. He did have some control of
his person, for he had allotted to him a bit of land upon[Pg 272]
which he could work without being driven by an overseer.
Later he was permitted to go out elsewhere for work, but
for this he must possess a legal permit. This led to the custom
of allowing him to pay his lord in money for his services
in lieu of work upon the land or returns from the land, and
then followed his being permitted to purchase his freedom,
so that the serf could become a freedman.

During the early part of the period the laboring and the
trading classes did not count as political, military, or social
factors. They are scarcely mentioned in the records of the
time. They were robbed by the nobles, their persons maltreated,
and their wives and daughters dishonored. There
were exactions of all kinds. They had to pay annual dues
for the use of the land, they had to give a certain number of
days free each year to the repair of the public roads and to
the cultivation of the lord's domains, and they had to be
ready, when called upon, to render military service of such
an inferior kind as they could do. "He was bound to bake
his bread at the lord's oven, grind his grain at the lord's
mill, and press his grapes in his lord's wine-press, paying, of
course, for the privilege; if he wanted to chase or cut wood
in the forest, or fish in the stream, or feed his cattle in the
pasture, all of which were reserved seigniorial rights, he must
pay his tax. He must pay the lord for the use of his weights
and measures, or for a guarantee against changes in his coinage.
He may not even sell the remnant of crops which
survived this accumulation of taxes until those of the lord
have been sold at the highest market price. After the lord
had squeezed the peasant almost to the point of extinction,
came the church with its even more effectual agencies of
terror and superstition. Its principal exaction was the tithe,
a tax of one-tenth upon the products of agriculture, a burden
sufficient, if rigidly enacted, to ruin any field industry. But
not content with this, the church, like the feudal seignior,
profited by every special occasion, birth, baptism, marriage,
death, to collect new contributions."202

Even in the seventeenth century the life of the laboring
man was very hard, as is shown in the following in reference
to the British peasant of that time. "At the first setting
out of the plough after Christmas, which was the time to
begin fallowing, or breaking up the pease earth, the teams-man
rose before 4      a.      m., and after thanks to God for his[Pg 273]
night's rest, proceeded to the beast house. Here he foddered
his cattle, cleaned out their booths, rubbed down the animals,
currying the horses with cloths and wisps. Then he watered
his oxen and horses. He next foddered the latter with chaff,
dry pease, oat hulls, beans, or clean garbage, such as the
hinder parts of rye. While they were eating their meal, he
got ready his collars, hames, treats, halters, mullers, and
plough gears. At 6      a.      m. he received half an hour's liberty
for breakfast. From seven till between two and three in the
afternoon he ploughed. Then he unyoked, brought home his
oxen, cleansed and foddered them, and, lastly, partook of his
dinner, for which he was again granted another half hour's
spell of leisure. By 4      p.      m. he was again in the stable. After
rubbing down his charges and re-cleansing their stalls, he
went to the barns, where he prepared the fodder for the following
day's bait. He carried this to the stable, and then
watered his beasts and replenished their mangers. It was
now close on 6      p.      m. He therefore went home, got his supper,
and then sat by the fireside, either mending his and the family's
shoe-leather, or knocking hemp and flax, or picking and
stamping apples and crabs for cider or vinegar, or grinding
malt on the quern, or picking candle rushes, till 8      p.      m.
He then lighted his lanthorn and revisited the stable, where
he again cleansed the stalls and planks, and replenished the
racks with the night's fodder. Then, returning to his cottage,
he gave God thanks for benefits received during the day,
and went to bed."203


The Town People. In the early part of this period the
artisans, like the field serfs, were grouped under a lord to
whom their products belonged. Later they grouped themselves
into communities and began to deal with the lord more
as a body and not as separate individuals, although at first
there was not much organization. There was a continuous
growth, though, toward closer organization till there arose
the great free city with its charter of freedom obtained from
the lord for services rendered or funds furnished in a time
of his great need.

The growth of commerce, too, aided in the formation of
these cities, as for the carrying on of trade it was necessary
to have centers where the people might come together. These
places might at first have been a fair, a temporary affair, but
gradually these centers became permanently established or[Pg 274]
old ones revived. For the carrying on of trade it was necessary
to have a medium of exchange and the amount of money
was increased by the cities through accumulation and coinage.
This gave to the cities a strong means for obtaining
freedom, as the lord was ever in need of funds and the
cities by accumulating money and having the power to raise
a general fund could from time to time buy rights from the
lord as his need of money became urgent.

In Italy and Germany the cities formed themselves into
corporations, the most noted perhaps being the Hanseatic
League. In England, however, the cities did not join together,
but each stood apart and cared for itself alone. They
became really more interested in the welfare of the town itself
than in that of the nation and the prosperity of the town
was of the most importance. The town could not set aside
the law of the land, but it could add to it as far as the government
of the town itself was concerned and ordinances
were passed relative to the welfare of the town. The officers
of these towns considered themselves as very important personages
and on occasions of state they arrayed their persons
in gorgeous robes and carried themselves with great dignity.
These towns erected stately churches and other public buildings
and adorned them magnificently.

A striking feature of town life of the Middle Ages was the
formation of guilds. This was not original with this period
for, as told under the chapter on Rome, there were organizations
at Rome similar to the guilds of the middle ages and
likewise there were similar organizations in Greece. In the
medieval period there were two kinds of guilds. The first
kind was of a general nature and it was organized for mutual
protection or aid, such as protection against thieves and aid
in times of sickness, old age, and the like. The second kind
was the trade guild, such as formed by merchants and craftsmen.
Guilds formed a very important element in the town
life of the Middle Ages, as almost all professions and occupations
had guilds.

The craft guild embraced all the members of a craft       the
apprentice, who was bound for service for a number of years
to learn the trade; the journeyman, or skilled laborer, who
received wages for his work; and the master, who controlled
the journeyman and the apprentice. The function of the
guild was to regulate and protect the craft and also to help
one another and to care for the orphan and the widow and[Pg 275]
the aged. Officers from their own body were appointed to
carry out the regulations and to have general oversight of the
organization.

"The medieval townsman was very narrow in his aims, very
selfish, and sometimes very cruel in his exclusiveness, but his
whole-hearted affection for his town, his anxiety for its welfare,
and his pride in its beauty are delightful: they must
have made his life very real and absorbing to him, and they
make it very attractive to us."204


The Aristocracy. As was stated before, during the middle
ages in Europe there grew up a sharp distinction between
the noble and the commoner, which was strongly emphasized
by inheritance till there became the grouping of people into
hard and fast classes. The nobility possessed two characteristics
that distinguished them from the common people which
were the right to inherit landed estate and the right to
knighthood. Thus arose a class born to estate and chivalry
which hardened into an aristocracy that was almost impossible
for the man born of the public to enter. Yet there were two
ways by which he might enter into nobility, by the purchase
of an estate to which the quality of nobility was attached,
which his children inherited, and through the creation of
new nobles by the king, which, though, was rarely done
during medieval times.

The love of show and magnificence was great during the
middle ages and was greatly displayed by the aristocracy of
the period. The most impressive and lavish displays were
centered round the person of the king. This was shown in
the gorgeous ceremonies and settings of his coronation, in
court etiquette and regulations, and in the large establishment
of his household. Some of the great nobles had establishments
that rivaled and even excelled that of the king.
The great lord had a large body of retainers who wore his
livery and badge, a great number of whom were members of
his household and ate at his table. These great lords were
lavish in their entertainment and sometimes impoverished
themselves through their hospitality, and were thereby compelled
to obtain money, which, as mentioned before, gave to
the cities the opportunity of securing privileges from them.
In England such nobles sometimes repaired their fortunes
by marrying the daughters of rich merchants or by engaging
in trade, but in France the old noblesse, whose social stand[Pg 276]ing
depended upon their ancient origin, preferred poverty to
such means of enriching themselves, which they would regard
with holy horror, and they kept their respect and dignity
through all the vicissitudes of misfortunes, without thus endangering
their pure strain of noble blood by mixing it with
that of the common herd or soiling their sacred persons with
the vulgar touch of trade.


The Home. As time went on in the Middle Ages, the houses
built as a means of defense grew less, so that the castle began
to disappear and the home to take its place. The houses began
to assume proportions of grandeur and forms of beauty,
the outgrowth of the love of magnificence and display of the
times. In England the manor houses were grouped around
a courtyard with the entrance through a gate-house. In the
house was a great hall, made to accommodate a large number
of people. The kitchen was a large room, sometimes having
three or four large fireplaces. Leading from the hall were
chambers for the lord and lady and guests. There were
also the bake-house, brew-house, stables, granaries, ox-stalls,
pig-sties, and other buildings.

The town houses had usually been no higher than two
stories, but later went up to three or four stories in height.
They often had gardens about them. They were built of
stone, brick, or wood, sometimes having a cellar of stone
while the upper part was wood. They were thatched with
straw, but often tiles were used. Thin horn, talc, and canvas
were placed across windows, but glass was coming into
more common use, so that many houses had glass in their
windows. The rooms were lighted by candles, sometimes
torches were used, the candles being set in standing or hanging
candlesticks of iron, wood, or latten. The heating was
done by a fire built in the center of the hall, the smoke escaping
through an opening in the roof, or there was a fireplace
in the corner or the side of the room. The fuel used
was wood, charcoal, ling, peat, or coal.

In the hall the furniture consisted of tables, seats, and a
cupboard. In the chamber was a bedstead with curtains
around it and the bedding consisted of a straw mattress, a
feather bed, bolster, pillows, sheets, and blankets. There
were chairs in the room, a table, and a clothes chest. The
walls were painted or hung with tapestry. The floors were
bare or strewn with rushes or straw, some floors being of
tiles, and carpets came into use late in the period.[Pg 277]


Women. At the time of the beginning of Christianity
women had reached a high position at Rome, having great
freedom, power, and influence. At the first women played
an important part in the activities of the Christians, but
later they were relegated to quite a subordinate place. The
old church fathers even went farther and claimed that woman
was a source of evil and that she should live in continual
penance on account of the curses she had brought upon the
world. So it became her duty to remain at home secluded,
going out into public only when visiting the sick or attending
church, and then she must be veiled. Nor should she enhance
her beauty, which was only a snare, by dress but such should
be simple and grave and of plain color, not for the purpose
of ornament but for protection alone.

"The influence of Christianity tended at once to elevate
and to narrow the position of women. It elevated her position,
for, while the pagan ideal of life is essentially masculine,
the Christian ideal is in part feminine. Justice, energy,
strength, are the pre-eminent qualities of the pagan ideal;
and mercy, love, gentleness, and humility, of the Christian.
The coincidence of the characteristics of Christianity with
the characteristics of the female heart resulted in the elevation
of woman. This result was also achieved in other
ways. In the realm of the emotions, and especially of the
religious emotions, woman is superior to man. If she is inferior
to him in her power of apprehending a system of
truth, she is his superior in respect to her loyalty to individuals.
Christianity demanded personal loyalty to a personal
Christ as the first and comprehensive condition of admission
to its church. Thus the influence of Christianity
ennobled the position of woman. This increased power was
manifest in various ways. Women flocked to the Church in
large numbers, and were important factors in the conversion
of the Empire. They embraced martyrdom with unflagging
zeal and fortitude. Although not usually admitted
to the priesthood, they performed ecclesiastical functions of
minor importance. As deaconesses       an order for which may
justly be claimed apostolic sanction       they were of peculiar
usefulness in the great and arduous work of charity and of
philanthropy. Of the asceticism which so early sprang up
they were ardent defenders. In their households, their influence
was more pervasive than in the Church. For the conversion
of their husbands and sons and daughters they la[Pg 278]bored
with constancy, if not always with wisdom, and often
with success. The wife of Theodosius the Great was one of
the most distinguished defenders of the faith. Augustine
writes of the influence of his mother in the formation of his
Christian character. The mother of Constantine bore an important
part in the conversion of her royal son. In dignity
and in useful influence, in social rights and family prestige,
Christianity tended to elevate the place of woman. For force
or passion as the basis of marriage       elements which when
exercised degrade the husband more than the wife       was substituted
love. The New Testament teaching was the foundation
of practice.

"But in one respect the position of the married woman was
narrowed by Christianity. It has been already noticed, that
in the civil marriage of the period of the later Republic and
Empire, the wife remained in the guardianship of her own
family. She did not pass into the control of her husband.
The consequence of this method was that the power of her
guardian became less and less, and that the power of her
husband did not increase. She, therefore, came to occupy
a situation of great independence as to both person and property.
Against the loose marital bond of the civil marriage,
which was indeed a mere species of wedlock, the Church uttered
its protest. It was contrary to the teachings of the
New Testament; it was opposed to Christian practice. In
their repudiation of the civil marriage, the Christian moralists
also repudiated that liberty and independence of the wife
which were among its essential elements. Thus the legal
position of the married woman was narrowed by the
Church."205

Among the early Germans, women were greatly respected.
Woman was considered man's inferior only in physical nature
and this very physical weakness was the one great cause
of her being so well respected. The wife was not thought
inferior to the husband in morality, courage, prudence, and
wisdom, but his equal. Although this was somewhat changed
by contact with the Romans, yet it appears to be the basis
for the building of the high honor paid to women in chivalry.
During the time of feudalism the wife tended to become the
husband's peer and companion. In the age of chivalry women
were held in high esteem, or at least women of the noble class,[Pg 279]
and they were subjects of great devotion by the knights and
squires.

During the Middle Ages many women possessed property
and because of this they had a social standing they would
not otherwise have had. But riches brought disadvantages
as well, as heiresses were in danger of being carried off and
compelled to marry their captors or to give them large sums
of money. If single a woman's property was more or less
under the control of her guardian and when married her
husband had control of her belongings. On the other hand,
the wife had a certain right in her husband's possessions and
upon his death she had her portion as dower.

Women entered into industrial affairs, as they engaged in
the manufacture and sale of many articles. They occupied
themselves in spinning and weaving, in making ribbons and
laces, in making shoes and candles, and other articles; they
sold fruit, bread, fish, poultry, and wares of different kind;
they were employed in farm work and in unskilled labor such
as carrying clay and water, gathering moss and heath, and
waiting on thatchers and masons. Women carried on foreign
commerce, in England exporting goods to France, Spain, and
other countries. They were permitted to become members of
guilds, although they did not take a very prominent part in
them.


Marriage. In the early Christian church marriage was
made to mean a great deal. Surrounded as the Christians
were by the moral rottenness of the decaying Roman state, it
became necessary for the sustenance of their religion that the
marriage vow should be a sacred obligation. To this end
marriage became a religious ceremony. A Christian could
not marry a pagan, as this vow could only be properly taken
between parties of the same religious belief and could thus
receive the benediction of the bishop. This idea of marriage
made chastity the all-important thing in woman and thus
created the home and gave to children a pure parenthood and
made childhood mean more to children than the world had
given before.

Among the Germans, and likewise other northern nations
of earlier Europe, monogamy was prevalent and almost the
universal practice. There was a kind of purchase of the wife,
as the man in the presence of her parents offered a dowry
to the bride, which if accepted sealed the match. The par[Pg 280]ties
to the contract both had to be mature people, the bridegroom
having to be old enough to be invested with arms and
to become a member of the state. Before the woman could
marry she had to have the consent of her father or nearest
relative, and if a widow, having been purchased, she had
to have the approval of the relatives of her deceased husband.

"Marriage ceremonies (among Anglo-Saxons) consisted in
the assemblage of friends, the consuming of the great loaf
(made by the bride as an introduction into house-keeping,
and the ancestor of our wedding-cake); some special barrels
of beer were brewed       the 'bride ale,' hence our modern
'bridal.' This beer was drunk to her health and to that of
the bridegroom (originally brydgumma, bridesman). The
Anglo-Saxons paid a regular sum, agreed upon beforehand,
to the father before the wedding; the consent of the lady
being obtained, the bridegroom then gave his promise and
his 'wed.' 'Nor,' adds Sharon Turner, 'was this promise
trusted to his honor merely, or to his own interest. The
female sex was so much under the protection of the law that
the bridegroom was compelled to produce friends who became
security for his due observance of the covenant.' In
this we have the origin of 'groomsman,' or 'best man,' of
our time. The parties being betrothed, the next step to take
was to settle by whom the fosten-léan, or money requisite for
the care of the children, was to be supplied. The bridegroom
pledged himself to do this; his friends became security for
him. These preliminaries being arranged, he had to signify
what he meant to give her for choosing to be his wife, and
what he should give her in case she survived him. This was
the morgen gifu, being given by the Anglo-Saxon husbands
to their wives on the morning after the wedding.206 The old
law says that it is right that she should halve the property,
or the whole of it should become hers if she had children,
unless she married again. The friends of the bridegroom
became surety for his conduct and those of the bride for hers.
A priest       when Christianity was introduced       blessed the
union; and after many points of law had been settled for the
protection of the wife under all circumstances, 'her relations
wedded her to him.' But in all these instances no mention[Pg 281]
is made of the wedding-ring, which came later. The English,
regarding the wife in her capacity of ruler of the household,
placed a ring upon her finger as a badge, not of servitude,
but of authority, as in the case of the consort of
Ethelred the Second, who before receiving the crown was
anointed and distinguished by this symbolic act of adornment."207

There was a time during the Middle Ages when betrothal
and even marriage took place at a very early age, even between
quite young children. In England boys could be married
at fourteen and girls at twelve, but these ages were
sometimes disregarded and children were married at even
younger ages. Betrothals were made by parents or guardians
for children of very young age, one such case is on record
as having been entered into when the little girl was but
four years of age, the child having been given in charge to
her future father-in-law. This custom was by far most common
among the upper classes, for, as a rule, the men and
women of the middle classes did not enter upon marriage till
of more mature age. These early marriages or betrothals
were probably the result of guardians having under their
charge children who were heirs and so they arranged the
marriage to their own advantage or sold their rights for a
sum of money, and even parents were known to have sold
the marriage of their children to gain money.

The idea of the early Christians that marriage should not
be civil but religious gradually prevailed till not only was
the ceremony performed by the church alone, but also
breaches of marriage vows were punished not by the state
but by the church. But this did not prevent marriage from
becoming a business affair, where the material advantages to
be gained were closely looked into and the amount of property
or money to be gained on either or both sides was the
most important and chief consideration. Nor did this prevent
informal marriages, for men and women did join themselves
together without priest or religious ceremony by a simple
declaration that they would take each other as husband
and wife. This was not accepted by the church nor always
recognized by the state, but such unions did take place nevertheless.

"It is sometimes thought that in the Middle Ages men were
always obliged to hold to their wives for better or worse to[Pg 282]
their lives' end. There are some grounds for this opinion,
but it is not quite correct. The Church did not allow divorce
in the modern sense of the word; that is to say, she taught
that a valid marriage could not be dissolved; but marriages
could be, and often were, annulled on the ground that some
impediment existed which rendered them invalid."208

There was no regular marriage among the serfs of the
earliest times. As marriage became more a church ceremony,
this institution established, about the twelfth century, the
legality of this ceremony among the serfs. This, of course,
caused difficulties when the serf of one lord married the serf
of another, and especially so when such parties had children.
Sometimes money satisfied this, sometimes other marriages,
and even sometimes the children were divided among the
two estates.


Dress. The simple and beautiful dress of the Greeks and
Romans was displaced during the Middle Ages by changing
costumes, which sometimes were of the most fantastic designs
and colors, sometimes ugly, and sometimes beautiful.
It is impossible to give here in detail the dress of all the
nations or even in a general way to depict the changes that
took place, and but one nation, England, will be considered,
and that only in a hurried way.

The early Britons used a mantle that covered the whole
body, which was fastened in front with a clasp or with a belt
about the waist. These mantles were of skins of animals, the
hair being left on for the outside of the garment. Sometimes
also they wore a woolen jacket. Their shoes were
made of coarse skins, the hair being left for the outside as
with the mantle. The women wore chains and rings and
bracelets, and their hair was left loose upon the shoulders
without braiding or tying.

The Anglo-Saxons had a linen undergarment over which
they wore a linen or woolen tunic, reaching to the knees,
with long, close sleeves, the tunic being fastened at the waist
with a belt. Over these garments they wore a short cloak,
fastened with clasps. They wrapped bands of cloth, linen,
or leather about the leg from the ankle to the knee, and their
shoes opened down the instep and were fastened with a
thong. The women wore a long, loose garment, like a tunic,
reaching to the ground, and over this a mantle. They
wrapped about the head and neck a kind of veil made of a[Pg 283]
long piece of silk or linen. The men wore the hair and
beard long.

The Normans made quite a display in dress. They wore
a long, close gown, reaching to the feet, often embroidered
with gold at the bottom, and fastened at the waist with an
ornamental girdle. Over this they wore a cloak with a hood,
fastened across the breast by a gold or silver brooch. The
women wore a loose dress, trailing on the ground, with girdle
round the waist, and a cloak over the dress. The men wore
their hair long, sometimes curling it like women, but they
wore no beard, shaving the face clean.

During the Middle Ages dress was a distinguishing mark
of very great importance. The king needed to be arrayed in
gorgeous robes of rich texture and color, as his dignity require
such; the city officers, in keeping with the pride of the
city, must be clothed in brilliant attire; the sign of power
and greatness of the nobles was displayed in the showy
livery of their retainers; and the uniform of the craft-guilds
was a badge of their importance in the life of the people
and of the nation. During the most of this period there
was great luxury in dress among the noble and wealthy.
Silks, satins, velvets, scarlet cloths, fine cloths of gold and
silver, and rich furs were used in the apparel of both sexes,
and not only was the finest and best of their own land used,
but also fine materials were brought in from other countries.
Not only was the clothing very costly, but also there was a
striving for a large amount, so that the expenditure for
dress was very great.

The men dressed as fanciful and elaborately as did the
women and the styles changed quite as often and as differently.
At one time they wore a close-fitting tunic with
tight or short sleeves and a short cloak; at a later time they
wore a long gown with long, full sleeves, and again their
clothing was padded, the shoulders being made as broad as
possible. Sometimes the colors of the garments would be of
one hue or well matched, and again there would be one garment
of one color and another of an entirely different color,
and even the parts of the same garment would not be of the
same color. "A dandy of the fourteenth century is thus
described: 'He wore long pointed shoes, fastened to his knees
by gold or silver chains; hose of one color on one leg, and
of another color on the other. Short breeches, not reaching
to the middle of the thigh; a coat, one-half white, and the[Pg 284]
other half black or blue; a long beard, a silk band buttoned
under his chin, embroidered with grotesque figures of animals,
dancing men, etc., and sometimes ornamented with
gold, silver, and precious stones.'"209

The women wore long dresses reaching to the ground and
sometimes with long trains. At times the bodices fit closely
and were low in the neck, while in another time the body
was encased in whalebone to the hips and the shoulders
supported an enormous ruff, as much as three feet or more
in width. Men also wore the ruff. The ladies used paint on
their faces and adorned them with black patches as "beauty
spots."

Men and women of the working classes dressed more simply
than the upper classes, usually wearing short tunics with
small sleeves and with hoods for outdoors. But they, too,
dressed up for special occasions and at times they were arrayed
in highly-colored and costly garments and even at times
vied with the upper classes, in spite of laws passed to prevent
people from dressing above their stations.

Children were clothed in about the same manner and the
same styles as their elders, there being no great distinguishing
marks in the dress of the younger and older people.

The girdles, which were so necessarily an important part
of the dress, were often highly ornamental and very costly.
They were sometimes made of silk, lined with fine leather,
and ornamented with gold and silver and precious stones.
The garments of both men and women were at times embroidered,
having armorial devices, mottoes, initials of the
owners, and other designs. They were also lined and trimmed
with fur, many kinds of fur being used.

The men wore their hair long and then again very short;
it was cut off short at the forehead and at another time allowed
to grow long till it almost fell into the eyes. Sometimes
they wore a full beard and sometimes they were clean
shaved. At a late time in the period wigs came into use, and
they were thought to be indispensable by every man of social
standing. They wore hoods and then caps and hats of various
styles. The women wore their hair loose down the back
or braided and coiled and put into a net of gold wire. At
one time great headdresses were the fashion, one style rising
up horn-like from the head, another being like a steeple,
running to a high point. There were also heart-shaped erec[Pg 285]tions,
turban-shaped, crescent-shaped, one like an inverted
lamp-shade, and still another shaped like a butterfly.

Shoes were of various styles, one style having very sharp-pointed
toes and even projecting far beyond the foot and
then turned up and fastened to the knee with a silver or
gold chain. Then the shoes were changed from length to
breadth, till Parliament passed a law limiting the width of
the toes to six inches. There was one kind made of fine,
soft leather cut into beautiful designs and worn over bright-colored
stockings that showed through the openings.

Jewelry was used quite a great deal. Caps and girdles
and other garments were sometimes decorated with precious
stones. They wore chains about the neck with pendants in
the shape of crosses, medallions, and the like. Reliquaries
(little cases containing relics) were also sometimes hung on
neck-chains. There were beads of gold and silver and ivory.
Brooches and clasps and rings of gold and silver studded
with jewels were quite common and other jewelry was worn.

"Very extraordinary ideas were current as to the properties
of jewels; talismanic and medicinal powers were attributed
to many of them       it was thought that the jaspar,
agate, and toad-stone neutralized or detected poisons, that
pearls dissolved in powder cured stomachic complaints, and
that coral acted as a charm. Great importance was attached
to engraving, because it was held that if a gem were engraved
by a skilful person under the right planetary influence
its virtue was greatly increased. If, for example, an
engraving depicting Ophinclius, the constellation which had
the power of resisting poison, were cut on an agate its efficiency
would be doubled. Even substances which had in
themselves no talismanic qualities could acquire them if they
were inscribed with words or symbols possessing them, and
consequently sacred names and mystic signs were frequently
placed not only upon gems, but also upon all kinds of
jewelry, and sometimes upon other things, such as drinking
cups, as well."210


Food. Eating and drinking was a most important function
of the middle ages. Banquets were held to celebrate great
events and feasting occurred on all occasions, both public and
private. Good things to eat were so well thought of that it
was the custom to send gifts of food to friends and patrons
and the very highest in the land, as was often shown in[Pg 286]
England, did not think it undignified to give or to receive
such presents, from whomever they might come. Towns in
order to gain favors would send out as presents large quantities
of food to royal personages, and loyalty shown by
towns and individuals was sometimes rewarded by the king
in the same way.

As artificial light was hard to get, the meals were usually
partaken of during daylight. The cooks of the time showed
great skill in the preparation of foods and in decorating their
dishes, being fond of coloring all kinds of food and displaying
branches and flowers about the food and table. The table
was covered with a cloth and each guest furnished with a
napkin, knife, and spoon but no fork, the fingers being used
instead. Good manners prohibited the putting of the knife
into the mouth, but it was all right to dip sops or morsels
into soups or sauces, and it was a mark of good breeding to
be able to carry such to the mouth without letting any drops
fall upon the tablecloth or the person.

There were many different kinds of bread; among the
meats were beef and pork, poultry and game of all sorts,
among such eaten being peacocks, gulls, swans, herons, and
cranes; many varieties of fish were to be had; there were
many different kinds of fruits and vegetables used, among
the fruits being quinces, pears, cherries, strawberries, apples,
peaches, plums, and grapes, and of the vegetables, peas, leeks,
cabbages, onions, turnips, parsnips, and beets. Soups and
broths were very common, and the mixing of ingredients in
dishes was much in use, as, meat was cut up into small pieces,
boiled, ground in a mortar, passed through a strainer, and
then mixed with spice, salt, sugar or honey, almonds, dates,
raisins, and grated bread, all being blended together with the
yolk of eggs.

The poorer classes sometimes fared badly, but usually in
England the peasants had sufficient food, although often of
the cheaper sort and not of great variety. "The methods
of preparing the raw material for baking differed in various
parts of this island. For a very long period it was imperative
on the manorial populations in both England and Scotland
that they should take their corn to be ground at the lord's
mill. But when this regulation fell into disuse, all sorts of
contrivances for grinding crept in. The most primitive was
undoubtedly that of the Highland peasant. The first process
was the separation of the grain from the ear. This was not[Pg 287]
threshed, but graddaned       that is to say, it was burned out
of the ear in much the same fashion as the parched corn of
Boaz. Either whole sheaves or several ears were fired on the
cottage floor. Though the burning of the entire sheaf was
the most expeditious process, it was a sad waste of manure
and thatch. Sometimes oats were beaten out of the straw
with a rude mallet, and kiln-dried. But usually both they
and barley underwent the burning treatment. The housewife
knelt before the fire, holding a few stalks in her left
hand. Setting the ears alight, she deftly beat out the grain
with a stick, just when the husk was quite consumed. The
grains, blackened like coal, were picked off the floor with the
hand and placed in the quern. This consisted of two stones,
1½ ft. in diameter, the lower slightly convex, the upper
slightly concave. In the middle of each was a round hole,
and on one side of it a long handle. The Scotch housewife
shed the grain into the hole with one hand, and worked the
handle round with the other. The corn slid down the convexity
of the lower stone, and by the motion of the upper one
was ground in the passage."211 "Hasty pudding was a great
favorite among the poorer sort. Indeed, all spoon meat of a
sweet description was popular, as Houghton proves by a delightful
little anecdote. Two Norfolk boys once were overheard
discussing the kind of treat in which either of them
would indulge if he became King of England. The one decided
that he would have pudding every day for dinner; the
other burst into tears, because his comrade's wish had left
him nothing good from which to choose."212


Children of the Ancient Britons. "It seems to have been
the custom of the Celts to plunge their new-born infants
into some lake or river in order to try the firmness of their
constitutions and to harden their bodies       this even in the
winter season. The Scandinavians used, it is said, to pour
water upon the heads of their children as soon as they were
born, and this long before the introduction of Christianity;
but there is no certainty that this custom was observed in
Britain. Before the introduction of Christianity the inhabitants
of the northern part of Britain did not give names, it is
said, to their sons before they had performed some brave action,
or given some indication of their disposition and character....[Pg 288]

"The early British matron, even of the highest rank, always
nursed her infants, and would have resented in the
greatest degree the delegation of this parental office to another
woman. We know little of the bringing up of the children.
There is a story of Solinus to the effect that his first
morsel of food was put into the infant's mouth on the point
of the father's sword, with a prayer that he might prove
a great and brave warrior and die on the field of battle.
This seems more likely to apply to the races who succeeded
them and the Roman occupation than to the veritable Britons.
... The Ancient Britons were accustomed almost from
infancy to handle arms and to sing the glorious actions of
their ancestors. The young were thus inspired to feats of
strength and to be engaged in war. As they advanced in
years they were, while being instructed in martial exercises,
also taught that everything in life depended on their valor       the
praises of the bards, the favor of the great, and the
applause of the people, and that happiness after death was
the reward only of those who were daring in war. It may
be considered certain that the youth of Britain at this period
were not delicately nurtured; a rough and hardy people
would not educate their children in a manner unfitting for
their surroundings and way of life, and doubtless       as in Germany       the
families of the nobler sort were brought up with
no more delicacy or tenderness than the common people.
Tacitus says of the Germans, 'In every house you see the
little boys, the sons of lords and peasants, equally sordid and
ill-clothed, lying and playing promiscuously together on the
ground and among the cattle, without any visible distinction.
In this manner they grow up to that prodigious strength
which we behold with admiration.' The sons of the ancient
Germans, Gauls, and Britains of all ranks were allowed to
run, wrestle, jump, swim, climb, and to engage in vigorous
exercises at their will and without restraint until they approached
manhood. To this continued exercise, together with
the simplicity of their diet, is ascribed by Caesar the great
strength of body and boldness of spirit to which these nations
attained. Caesar says that when the youth of Germany,
Gaul, and Britain began to approach the manly age, some
more attention seems to have been paid to them by the public
and their parents than previously, for when the son was
younger it was accounted a shame for a father to be seen in
his company. Children who were designed for the priestly[Pg 289]
order were then put under the direction of the Druids for
their instruction in the sciences and in the principles of law,
morality, and religion, while those who were intended for a
warlike life       according to Caesar       had arms put into their
hands by their fathers, or nearest kinsmen, in a public assembly
of the warriors of the state or clan. Some vestiges
of this custom continued till later times       especially with respect
to the eldest sons of the lairds or chieftains       in some
parts of the Highlands and western isles of Scotland."213


Children among the Early Christians. The old church
fathers were so much given to ascetism that it would appear
as if there was really an antagonism to marriage in their
time and which must have had a great influence on family
life. Donaldson states214 that children are seldom mentioned
in the Christian writings of the second and third centuries,
and that almost nothing is said of their training, as
if there were but little attention given to their instruction.
And yet infants were considered with a much higher standard
than among the Greeks and Romans, for, as given in the
chapters dealing with children among these nations, infanticide
was practiced by them, as the father had the right to
expose his children, so that infants on their birth might be
abandoned and left to perish, and this was particularly the
case with weakly and deformed children and often with female
children without blemish. From the very first Christianity
condemned the practice and denounced it as murder.
They even went further, for the church forbid the practice
of the destruction of children before birth. Thus Christianity
protected the lives of infants and especially of female
infants.


Child and Parent. In England at least there did not at
times seem to have been a great, strong affection between
parents and children. This may have been caused in part
from the custom of boarding out the children or sending them
out to be servants or ladies-in-waiting to the persons with
whom they were sent to live, as children who would thus go
out from parents at an early age and not getting to see them
often would not have the opportunity of showing affection
for them and they would naturally take up with the people
with whom they came in daily contact. The children who
were sent to boarding-school were there throughout the en[Pg 290]tire
year, being at home only a few days at a time, on holidays.
Another cause for the lack of affection between parents
and children may have been from the custom of the
remarriage of parents, the new husband or the new wife
drawing the affection away from the children. Although the
children showed outward respect to their parents, which was
well portrayed in the letters they wrote to them, yet it would
seem there was not so deep an inward respect.


Care and Treatment of Children. Children were brought
up quite strictly during the Middle Ages. They were punished
very much, minor offenses often bringing a severe punishment,
for it was held that every child needed correction and
that quite frequently. The children of the poor were usually
put to work when very young and had to undergo much
suffering. Orphans had the hardest lot of all, for if parents
cared so little for their own children and often neglected
them, they would care still less for the children of other
people, and so would neglect them or treat them cruelly.
If the orphans were heirs, they were often despoiled of their
possessions by their guardians or married to parties unfit for
them in order to have control of their estate. Of course, all
parents were not lacking in affection and all guardians were
not knaves. Yet it would seem that children during the
Middle Ages did not have the happiest of times and they often
lived miserable lives.


Apprenticeship. There arose during the Middle Ages a belief
that every child should be trained to do something. As
was stated under feudalism, it was the custom for boys of
the upper classes to be sent into the homes of nobles and
churchmen to serve a number of years in order to become
learned in chivalry and to acquire the use of arms. In like
manner there grew up for the boys of the common classes
the apprenticeship system, whereby they were placed under
a master to spend a number of years to learn a trade or to
carry on agriculture.

It was held, at least in England, that all able-bodied men
should work and to that end they should be trained as boys,
so that when grown up they would be able to work at a
trade or farming and thereby earn their own living and not
become a burden upon the state. During the sixteenth century
it became a law that every child should have such training
as would fit him for business or a calling. Some were
apprenticed to trades and some to agriculture. If a parent[Pg 291]
could prove that he was able to furnish a maintenance for
his children they were not apprenticed, but otherwise, if the
children were found to be growing up in idleness, the authorities
had the power to apprentice them.

There was a fee charged for apprenticeship to a trade,
sometimes only an entrance fee and again an annual due,
but not very large in either case. The term of service varied,
in France being from three to thirteen years, while in England
it generally lasted seven years. The apprentice probably
secured no pay at any time, but was cared for by the
master in the way of food, lodging, clothing, and other needs.
After he had completed his years of service, the apprentice
became a journeyman and then entered regularly into the
trade, receiving wages for his labor. In the earlier times the
journeyman could easily become a master, but later when
capital began to be amassed and the carrying on of the
manufacture of goods required much capital, the journeyman
did not have very good opportunity for becoming a
master. In the early days master, journeyman, and apprentice
all lived and worked together and were in the same guild,
and so there was not any great separation among them. But
later when a large amount of capital was required to carry
on business and a large number of men used, there became
a wide difference between master and workmen and strife
grew up between them and journeymen formed guilds for
themselves alone, which guilds were sometimes suppressed by
the authorities. Such a guild came in time to prohibit aliens
from becoming apprentices, and thus from learning the trade,
and even to restricting apprenticeship to the children and
relatives of its members who were working in the trade.


Military Training for the Young. In order to bring back
the old military training in England, in 1511 an act was
passed "that every man being the king's subject, not lame,
decrepit, or maimed, being within the age of sixty years,
except spiritual men, justices of the one bench and of the
other, justices of the assize, and barons of the exchequer, do
use and exercise shooting in long bows, and also do have a
bow and arrows ready continually in his house, to use himself
in shooting. And that every man having a man child
or men children in his house, shall provide for all such, being
of the age of seven years and above, and till they shall come
to the age of seventeen years, a bow and two shafts, to learn
them and bring them up in shooting; and after such young[Pg 292]
men shall come to the age of seventeen years, every one of
them shall provide and have a bow and four arrows continually
for himself, at his proper costs and charges, or else
of the gift and provision of his friends, and shall use the
same as afore is rehearsed."215


Amusements. The people of medieval times were much
given to amusements. This was particularly true of the people
of England and what follows here is for the most part
about that country.

The greatest pastime of the nobility was that of war, and
the joust and the tournament were the most attractive amusements
because they most resembled war. The young men engaged
in a sport known as tilting at quintain, which was designed
to prepare them for warfare. The figure of a Saracen
with a saber or club in its right hand and a shield on the
left arm was hung up so that it would turn about very
readily. A young man on horseback with a lance or something
similar, as in a joust, would ride at the figure and
strive to strike it between the eyes or on the nose, for if
some other part was struck the figure would be turned round
so as to give the rider a blow on the back with the saber or
club, which not only brought a laugh at his expense, but
also helped to teach the young candidate for knighthood to
aim accurately another time. This was practiced on other
objects, as, tilting at a tree or post or at a ring. Another
military exercise was throwing the spear or javelin, which
might be at the quintain or some other object or to throw
it to the greatest distance. Learning to throw with the sling
was also another military exercise. Another great sport in
the early times of this period was that of archery. Foot-races
took place and likewise wrestling.

Hunting has ever been a great sport in England. The
ancient Britons were hunters, as were the Saxons and also
the Danes in England. But it remained for the Normans
to bring hunting to a system, for they were not content to
hunt in an open country, but took up thousands of acres and
enclosed them in parks and stocked them with game and prohibited
the common people from hunting within them, passing
severe laws against such. There was a form of hunting
that is most striking and became a great rage, which was
hawking or falconry. This was greatly indulged in by both
men and women and the birds they used for taking the[Pg 293]
other birds were highly trained and brought great prices.
This was the sport of the gentility and common people were
not at all allowed to partake of it. Fishing was another
sport, as was horse-racing and bull-baiting and cock-fighting.
Throwing at cocks was another brutal amusement, wherein a
heavy stick was thrown at a bird and if knocked over it
belonged to the thrower if he could run and catch it before
it could get to its feet.

The people managed so as to get quite a bit of pleasure
out of their religion. One pastime was the wakes. On an
evening preceding a saint's day the people went with lighted
candles to the church, which was originally for the purpose
of worship, but later it came to be a time for dancing and
singing and eating, hawkers and peddlers congregating about
the church to serve the crowd. Another church affair was
the church ales. The church officials would brew a large
quantity of ale before a holiday when there would be
gatherings of people who bought and drank the ale, the
profits being used for the good of the church. Another
amusement was hocking, which took place on the Monday or
Tuesday following the second Sunday after Easter. Men
would hold a rope across a road and take toll of every woman
passing or else women would have charge of the rope and
collect toll off the men, the receipts going into the church
treasury. The miracle and morality plays and the like, too,
though intended as a means of instruction, became really a
form of amusement for the masses.

Christmas was a great time for merry-making. One of the
affairs at the time was mumming. Masks were used and disguises
put on so as to impersonate all kinds of people and
even animals. These mummers would make calls on people
and sometimes even on high personages, making their entrances
and exits without saying anything. May-day was a
great occasion. Upon this day the houses would be decorated
with flowers and branches from trees. There would be
the dance about the May-pole and many games and plays.
There were fair days, when people came together for traffic
and for sports. There were sack races for the young men
and smock races for the young women. Also there were
wheelbarrow races and other kinds of races and contests.
One such contest was the grinning match, where each person
in the contest would thrust his head through a horse's
collar and they would then vie with one another in grinning.[Pg 294]
In the yawning match, they would wait till late at night when
all were tired and sleepy and then each would try to yawn
the greatest. The one that yawned the widest and the most
naturally and would thereby cause the most yawns from all
present would win the prize.

It was a custom during this period for kings and great
nobles to have Fools, who were the butt of all and who made
all the butt of their jokes. They also kept minstrels in their
households. Sometimes these minstrels played on different
kinds of musical instruments and formed a musical band.
Among the musical instruments were the ruible (a two-stringed
instrument played with a bow), the veille (an instrument
somewhat like a violin), the gitern (a kind of
guitar), the harp, bagpipe, trumpet, pipe, lute, dulcimer,
tambourine, and cymbals. There were a number of other
kinds of entertainers, as, acrobats, rope-walkers, jugglers,
contortionists, and conjurers. There was wire-dancing, rope-dancing,
ballet-dancing, and sword-dancing. There were dancing
bears and trained monkeys. There were entertainers
who disguised themselves as birds and other animals and
imitated their actions and cries. Dancing was, also, an amusement
of the middle ages and it was indulged in by the nobility
and all classes of the people.

There were plays acted in the castles and the towns and
the colleges and the schools and even in the churches in the
way of mysteries and moralities. There were strolling bands
of players that attended wakes and fairs and played in barns
and taverns and even in the farmhouse kitchen, wherever
they might find place. "I shall transcribe out of Hall a
description of a play which was acted by the boys of St.
Paul's School, in 1527, at Greenwich. The occasion was
the despatch of a French embassy to England, when Europe
was outraged by the Duke of Bourbon's capture of Rome,
when the children of Francis I. were prisoners in Spain, and
Henry, with the full energy of his fiery nature, was flinging
himself into a quarrel with Charles V. as the champion of
the Holy See.

"At the conclusion of a magnificent supper 'the king led
the ambassadors into the great chamber of disguisings; and
in the end of the same chamber was a fountain, and on one
side was a hawthorne tree, all of silk, with white flowers, and
on the other side was a mulberry tree full of fair berries,
all of silk. On the top of the hawthorne were the arms of[Pg 295]
England, compassed with the collar of the order of St.
Michael, and in the top of the mulberry tree stood the arms
of France within a garter. The fountain was all of white
marble, graven and chased; the bases of the same were balls
of gold, supported by ramping beasts wound in leaves of
gold. In the first work were gargoylles of gold, fiercely
faced, with spouts running. The second conceit of this fountain
was environed with winged serpents, all of gold, which
griped it; and on the summit of the same was a fair lady,
out of whose breasts ran abundantly water of marvellous delicious
savour. About this fountain were benches of rosemary,
fretted in braydes laid on gold, all the sides set with
roses, on branches as they were growing about this fountain.
On the benches sate eight fair ladies in strange attire, and
so richly apparelled in cloth of gold, embroidered and cut
over silver, that I cannot express the cunning workmanship
thereof. Then when the king and queen were set, there was
played before them, by children, in the Latin tongue, a manner
of tragedy, the effect whereof was that the pope was in
captivity and the church brought under foot. Whereupon
St. Peter appeared and put the cardinal (Wolsey) in authority
to bring the pope to his liberty, and to set up the church
again. And so the cardinal made intercession with the kings
of England and France that they took part together, and
by their means the pope was delivered. Then in came the
French king's children, and complained to the cardinal how
the emperour kept them as hostages, and would not come to
reasonable point with their father, whereupon they desired
the cardinal to help for their deliverance; which wrought so
with the king his master and the French king that he brought
the emperour to a peace, and caused the young princess to be
delivered.'"216

The game of dice was found in England from an early
period, as the Saxons, Danes, and Normans were much given
to it, and during the Middle Ages dice were in great force and
much used in gambling. There were also chess and draughts
and domino and backgammon. Cards came into use late in
this period, perhaps not earlier than the latter part of the
fourteenth century, and seem not to have been much used
in England before the middle of the fifteenth century. Gambling
was very common among all classes, so much so that
one of the restrictions in the indenture of apprentices was[Pg 296]
that they should keep from places where gambling was carried
on. Some of the guilds had to pass laws that no help
would be given a member who got into trouble or fell into
poverty through playing dice.

Ball-playing was engaged in during the Middle Ages, just
as in all ages and in all countries. The ball was, perhaps,
more of a favorite in England than in any other country
in Europe. They had club-ball, one player throwing the
ball and another striking it with a straight club; cambuc
or bandy-ball was probably a kind of golf, as the ball was
struck on the ground with a curved club, called a bandy; pall-mall
must have been a kind of croquet, as a wooden ball was
used which was struck with a mallet and driven through
arches of iron, there being an arch at each end of the grounds;
in hand-ball the ball was struck with the palms of the hands
against a wall or over something, being somewhat like tennis
without a racket, and then later tennis with net and racket
came to be played; there was foot-ball, the ball being kicked
about by the foot.

Tip cat was a game played with a piece of wood called
a cat, pointed at each end much like a double cone, which
was laid on the ground in the center of a large ring; the
player would strike one end of the cat with a stick, causing
it to fly upward, which he then tried to strike to knock it
out of the ring. There was bowling, many villages having
bowling-greens. They also played quoits, fox and geese, and
other kinds of outdoor games.

Young people played in the games and indulged in the
sports mentioned in the foregoing and children played many
of them, and also they had many other sports, such as spinning
tops, catching butterflies and beetles, playing blind
man's buff, and the like.


Education. The early Christians, surrounded as they were
with pagan thoughts and ideas found it necessary to withdraw
themselves from such influences, and, as they were
without schools of their own, they became largely illiterate,
having no training beyond what was obtained through their
religion. Although they received but little literary education,
yet they were given moral training of the very highest
and best. As the church grew there was found the necessity
of instructing those who were being brought into it, as well
as the young, and so there arose what were known as the
catechetical schools.[Pg 297]

These schools began more and more to come under the influence
of the old pagan culture and to drift away from their
original purpose of giving religious instruction and to enter
more upon the intellectual side. To counteract this they
were finally taken away from the laity and brought under the
influence of the clergy and came to be established in connection
with the churches and then these schools became to be
known as cathedral schools. They then gradually grew to
become used for the training of the clergy. When monasteries
arose in connection with the Christian church, there
grew up in them schools for the training of those who were to
become monks or priests. Thus education became to be less
common than under Roman civilization and the schools to be
used mostly for those who were to enter more directly into the
work of the church.

One of the marked characteristics of the Middle Ages was
the growth of the idea of education for all classes. In the
early part of the period education was not considered highly
important for any one, then came the idea of education for
those who were to enter into clerical duties, and then last of
all began to grow up the idea of education for all, whatever
the future life work might be. That classical learning in its
essential features was preserved to Europe was due to the
Christian church, for keeping up the use of the Latin language
the churchmen were thus given access to the written
works of Roman culture and through them much was retained,
especially in the monasteries. While the Roman civilization
was almost annihilated in the central part of the empire, the
extreme eastern and western parts were relatively undisturbed
and classical learning was maintained in them, Ireland
being the chief center in the West, from whence later this
learning was returned to the central part of Europe. There
were three distinct outbursts of learning following the darkest
time of the period, the first being under Charlemagne
(742-814) in France and Central Europe, the second in England
under Alfred the Great (849-901), and the third under
the Mohammedans in Spain.

The course of study in the schools of the Middle Ages was
primarily designed to train the clergy to be able to participate
in the church services and also to conduct them. The instruction
was given in the elementary or song school which
was followed by the grammar school and then by higher instruction.
In the elementary school reading, writing, music,[Pg 298]
arithmetic, and Latin were taught. In reading the beginner
was taught by the alphabetic method and when reading was
begun careful attention was given to enunciation and accent
and often boys were taught to read well without knowing
the meaning of the words of the Latin they were reading. In
writing wax tablets were used in the earlier times and then
there came into use pen, ink, and parchment. This was an
important phase of education because of the need of copying
books. Music was an important subject because of its use in
the church service. Arithmetic was begun by counting and
then simple operations on the fingers, adding, subtracting,
multiplying, and dividing being drilled into the pupils
through oral work, but little written work being done. Latin
was only of an elementary form, a beginning in conversation
being made. The student who went on with his studies took
up the subjects of the trivium       grammar, rhetoric and dialectic.
If he wished to pursue his studies further he entered
into the subjects of the quadrivium       arithmetic, geometry,
music, and astronomy.

There were three kinds of medieval church schools       the
monastic school, the cathedral school, and the parish school.
The monastic school occupied a place within the monastery
and it was primarily intended for those who were to enter
into monastic life; there were no charges for tuition, the
school being maintained through gifts from pupils, sometimes
such being quite large; the poor pupils were supported by
charity or they paid their way by copying books or by doing
other things. In the cathedral school there was usually a
song school, for elementary instruction, and a grammar school,
for those who should want more advanced education. As assistants
in the smaller churches needed instruction, parish
schools were established, in which there was but little training
given beyond that needed for participation in the church
services.

Lay education arose in this period in three ways. In the
first place it came through the education and training of those
intended for knighthood, as such produced standards of deportment
that impressed themselves upon the upper classes
in such a way that as civilization advanced and means of intercourse
widened there came a need of systematic instruction
so that there arose the great public schools of England and
similar schools upon the continent. In the second place the
growing importance of the cities in industry and commerce[Pg 299]
led to the establishment of schools for the training of the city
youth, so that the burgher school was produced. Under the
guild system there arose a kind of industrial education and
the need of means of instruction of the young of the guild
members so that guild schools were formed.

During the period following the fall of Rome, the culture
and learning of Greece and Rome were almost entirely lost
to central and western Europe. Only here and there was a
little retained, usually in some monastery where some of the
old manuscripts were stored away. Yet learning was never
entirely lost, and when the Crusades arose and the people of
the West came in contact with the old Greek culture in eastern
Europe and with the scientific learning of the Moslems,
and who brought learning again into Spain, they brought back
with them a widening interest in learning. Too, as commerce
grew and wealth increased there became more leisure for
learning and there grew up a desire for further knowledge
and, so to the education as discussed in the foregoing paragraphs
there was added a still higher form, that of the university.

The university arose during the Middle Ages. In its beginning
it came neither directly from church or state. The
awakening of a scientific spirit and the spreading abroad of
discussion through scholasticism caused to arise centers around
which learned men gathered about them the young men of the
times. The earliest of these were the universities of Bologna
and Salerno in the twelfth century. The former was for the
study of law and the latter for medicine. The University of
Paris originated near the same time and in it arose the four
faculties       theology, philosophy, law, medicine       which are still
extant to-day in the universities. Oxford, Cambridge, Vienna,
and many other universities were formed during this period.

From the very first, special privileges were conferred upon
the universities by the authorities. Sometimes they were allowed
to have full control of their own affairs, having their
own special courts. Again those connected with the universities
were exempt from military service, except in time of
great need, and from paying taxes. There were a number of
other privileges granted. These privileges were not always
granted because of the high regard in which the university
was held but sometimes they were gained by the university
threatening to remove to another place and even doing this,
for there were no great plants in those days demanding per[Pg 300]manent
residence as now, as professors and students were
about all there was to a medieval university as the buildings
usually were furnished for them and there were no great
libraries or laboratories or other equipment. These privileges
often led to abuses on the part of the students for many of
them led dissolute lives and others became bullies and adventurers.
Whatever may have been the cause, it is too true that
the moral tone of the medieval university was low.

The medieval university in its organization was similar to
the guild, the term signifying a company of persons that were
joined together for study. There came to be a natural grouping
together of the students from the same part of the world
so that there arose the nations, and each year each nation
elected a councillor, who was to be the chief to act for the
nation. The university was organized into faculties, the complete
number being four, of arts, law, medicine, and theology.
Each faculty elected a dean, as its representative, and then
deans and councillors elected the rector, the head of the university.
In the South the rector was usually a student while
in the North he was generally elected from the body of professors.

At first the courses offered differed in the various universities,
but later the courses were fixed either by a papal decree
or by the faculty. The student was not only to acquire
the subject, but to be able to debate upon it. He was expected
to memorize the professor's lecture and to prepare himself in
debate so as to be ready to cope with students taking the other
side of the question.

Usually the courses in arts were taken by the younger students
as a preparation for the professional training. At
first the bachelor's degree meant only that the one receiving
it was granted the privilege to enter upon the work leading to
the other degrees, but later it became a separate degree.
Master and doctor at first were about of equal rank, and then
later doctor represented a higher period of learning.

The Church Fathers were quite severe in their ideas of education.
The most famous writings among them on the subject
are by Saint Jerome on the education of girls, being letters
to a mother. Some of the admonitions are as follows:

"Do not allow Paula to eat in public, that is, do not let her
take part in family entertainments, for fear that she may
desire the meats that may be served there. Let her learn not
to use wine, for it is the source of all impurity. Let her food[Pg 301]
be vegetables, and only rarely fish; and let her eat so as always
to be hungry.

"For myself, I entirely forbid a young girl to bathe.

"Never let Paula listen to musical instruments; let her
even be ignorant of the uses served by the flute and the harp.

"Do not let Paula be found in the ways of the world (emphatic
paraphrase for streets), in the gatherings and in the
company of her kindred; let her be found only in retirement.

"Do not allow Paula to feel more affection for one of her
companions than for others; do not allow her to speak with
such a one in an undertone.

"Let her be educated in a cloister, where she will not know
the world, where she will live as an angel, having a body but
not knowing it, and where, in a word, you will be spared the
care of watching over her."217

Whatever we may think of the foregoing, we must agree
that the following advice is most wholesome:

"Do not chide her for the difficulty she may have in learning.
On the contrary, encourage her by commendation, and
proceed in such a way that she shall be equally sensible to
the pleasure of having done well, and to the pain of not having
been successful.... Especially take care that she do
not conceive a dislike for study that might follow her into
a more advanced age."218

There is not very much given on education of women during
the medieval period. It is no doubt true that girls received
even less education than did boys. During the time of chivalry
the young women, like the young men, were often educated
in the castle of some knight or lord, being trained in
household management, music, and gentle manners. It would
seem that sometimes girls had in their own homes governesses
for training them. Sometimes girls and little boys were sent
together to nunneries to be educated. Here and there are
found references which imply that some women were well
educated for their times and particularly so in languages,
reading and writing and speaking English, French and Spanish.
But in the main it was considered that all the training
necessary for the girls was a little elementary education and
such knowledge of housework and management as would fit
them for wives.[Pg 302]


The Children's Crusade. Among the greatest events in
medieval Europe were the Crusades, and perhaps the most
striking was the Children's Crusade. This occurred in 1212
A.      D., in France and Germany. The early Crusades had been
successful in taking Palestine away from the Saracens and a
Christian kingdom had been established with Jerusalem as its
center. But at the time of the Children's Crusade, Palestine
had nearly all again fallen into the hands of the Mohammedans.
It is true there had been three later crusades, but
they were not successful and they had for a time ceased
against Palestine and had been turned against parts of Europe.
One such was made on Germany, a second was against
the Saracens in Spain, and a third was against the Albigenses
in southern France. People became indifferent in reference
to Palestine, so the church sent out chosen ones to arouse enthusiasm
and to strive to bring about another Crusade.
Amid such scenes arose the Children's Crusade.

Never was there at any other time such an arousing of
children. All classes of children were included. Children
came from the hovel of the peasant, the hut of the shepherd,
the home of the merchant, and the castle of the lord. Most of
them enrolled in the Crusade from religious fervor, but many
went only to get away from the restraints of home. Sad it is,
too, that many worthless characters, both men and women,
flocked to the standard of the children. Many girls were included
in this movement, but the very greater part were boys
under twelve years of age. The children seemed to be filled
with the fervor and nothing could restrain them. When the
procession of children went along it made the others wild to
join. If by any means children could be detained by their
parents, they pined so that they had to be given their freedom
and be allowed to join the throng.

In France the leader was Stephen of Cloyes, who at the
time of the Crusade was about twelve years of age. He was
the son of a poor peasant, a shepherd. When old enough,
Stephen was sent out to tend sheep and for some years he
spent his summers upon the plains near his home. As in
other parts of Europe, so at Cloyes means were taken to arouse
the people to another crusade into Palestine. Among such
were processions in which was shown the condition of the
Christians in Palestine and with entreaties for the people to
strive to redeem the Holy Land. As with all the others,
Stephen must have witnessed these scenes and have listened to[Pg 303]
the portrayals of affairs in Palestine, which he must have
greatly considered while tending his sheep.

One day a stranger appeared before him and stated that he
was a pilgrim from Palestine, and asked for food. Stephen
fed the stranger and asked in return to be told about the
Holy Land. The stranger told his stories and he must have
seen that Stephen was greatly affected as he finally declared
himself to be Jesus Christ and to have come to appoint
Stephen to lead the children in a crusade, and gave him a
letter to the king of France. Stephen at once entered into his
holy mission and told his story to parents and neighbors,
showed the letter he had to the king, and declared himself
to be called to go forth as a leader in the Crusade.

Stephen called the children to his crusade and there flocked
about him the children of his neighborhood, but he soon saw
that he could not arouse the nation, from this out-of-the-way
place. So he determined to go to the greatest religious center
in France, the city of St. Denis, the place of burial of the
martyr Dionysius, whose tomb was the great shrine of the
land, to which great crowds went on pilgrimages. To this
place Stephen went, attired in his shepherd's dress, crook in
hand, and wallet by side. He went from crowd to crowd,
before the church door and in the market place, showing his
letter to the king and preaching his Crusade. It was not long
before he attracted attention and aroused enthusiasm in the
young. The people carried news of him throughout France as
they returned to their homes and the young people gathered
together their fellows and returned with crowds of children
to Stephen. As the numbers increased, Stephen led them
through the towns and villages till he had all the children wild
to join him. This did not go on without some opposition.
Some of the more intelligent men, among them some from the
clergy, thought it should not go on, and even the king, Philip
Augustus, was in doubt about it. He asked an opinion concerning
it from the University of Paris, and after due deliberation
its members advised the king that the movement
should be stopped even if vigorous means had to be used.
The king then issued an edict, commanding the children to
give up the enterprise and to return to their homes. This
edict had but little effect, as the movement went right on, and
the king did not dare enforce the edict.

The crowds of children gathered more and more over
France and Stephen designated Vendôme as the central place[Pg 304]
in which to assemble and to get ready to depart for Palestine.
This was a good selection as it was an important place and
with roads coming into it from all directions. The bands of
children came into Vendôme in great numbers, one chronicler
stating that there were fifteen thousand children under twelve
years of age from Paris alone, and although in all probabilities
this is an overestimation, yet it shows there was a vast assembly
of children, so much so that Vendôme could not contain
them and they had to encamp outside its walls, each band
to itself so that those from the same city or community were
together. The children were from all parts of France, varying
in language and dress, but not in zeal. Whether they all
wore a uniform is not known, but they did put on the Cross
of the Crusaders, made of red woolen cloth and sewed on the
right shoulder of the coat by some one of the leaders, and of
which emblem the children were all very proud. Finally all
the bands had gathered and Stephen was ready to make the
start for the sea, which was to open and let them march
through to the Holy Land. The number assembled at Vendôme
was about thirty thousand.

The message of the pilgrim delivered to Stephen must have
come the last of April or the first of May, 1212, as it occurred
shortly after Stephen had observed in the city of Chârtres the
procession to commemorate the sufferings of those who had
died in defense of the Holy Land and which was held on St.
Mark's day, April 25th. He went to St. Deny's in the month
of May and to Vendôme, perhaps, the last of May or the first
of June and the start for the sea was made the last of July
or the first of August, all of the same year.

And now all was ready for the departure from Vendôme.
Their leader Stephen had become so great that there was provided
for him a carriage, decorated with flags and tapestries
of brilliant colors, and over him was a canopy of rich draperies
as a protection from the heat of the sun. About his carriage
was a band of youths of noble blood, on horseback, and
equipped as knights, acting as his body guard. Good-byes
were said and the procession, singing their songs, with flags
and oriflammes, started. At the beginning of the journey
Stephen was given great honor and gladly obeyed, they even
vied with one another in showing him adulations and tried to
secure a piece from his clothing or from the trimmings of the
carriage or from the trappings of the horses which was kept
as a relic and used as a charm. But as days went on and hard[Pg 305]ships
and sufferings came upon them and their journey lengthened
out, they became little more than a straggling crowd
without order or discipline, and then Stephen's authority was
no longer regarded by them. Their journey was to Blois,
where they crossed the Loire, and then to Lyons, where the
Rhone was crossed, and thence to Marseilles. As they were
asked on the way where they were going they all answered:
"To Jerusalem." This was an unusually hot summer and the
children suffered greatly from heat and thirst and many of
them from hunger, although the people along the way sympathized
with the movement and aided them. At last they
came to Marseilles. They asked for shelter in the city for the
night only, as on the morrow God was to open the sea for
them and they would proceed on their way to the Holy Land.

The city granted their request and the children entered the
gates and went into the city, singing their songs as they
marched through the streets. They passed the night and in
the morning they went to the sea to go on with their journey.
The sea did not open that day nor the next day nor on any
day. This discouraged them and many gave up, but others
remained, hoping for a way to Palestine. And a way did
come, for two merchants of Marseilles, Hugo Ferreus and
William Porcus, so their Latin names read, offered "for the
cause of God, and without price," to provide ships for their
transport. Preparations then were made, and seven ships
furnished and it is estimated that about five thousand children
went on board these ships to proceed on their way to Palestine.
Nothing further was heard of these children who sailed from
Marseilles on that August day in 1212, till in 1230, eighteen
years afterward, when a priest came to Europe from Palestine
and told that he was among those who were on the vessels
with the children. He stated that two of the ships were
wrecked off the coast of the island of San Pietro and all on
board perished. The other five ships were taken to Bujeiah
and Alexandria and the children were sold to the Saracens.
Upon learning of this, Pope Gregory IX. had a church built
on the island where the wreck occurred and had the remains
of the children interred in it and named it the Ecclesia
Novorum Innocentium       The Church of the New Innocents.

The story of Stephen at St. Denys was not only carried all
over France, but likewise to the neighboring countries, spreading
to the Rhine provinces in Germany. It reached a village
near Cologne where lived a boy who was about the same age[Pg 306]
as Stephen and by the name of Nicholas. Like Stephen he,
too, was a shepherd boy, and he had heard the stories about
the Crusades. When he learned about Stephen there arose
a desire to do as he, and aided by his father, some say induced
by him, he took upon himself the preaching of a children's
crusade for Germany. He, too, had been called to the work,
as he stated while with his flocks he saw a blazing cross in the
sky and there came to him a voice that told him the cross was
to lead him to victory in his undertaking to recover the Holy
Land. Like Stephen, too, Nicholas went to a great religious
center, the city of Cologne, as at this time this city was a
great center for pilgrimages, as in its cathedral rested the
bones of the "Three Kings of the East" who came "with a
great multitude of camels to worshippe Christ, then a little
childe of thirteen dayes olde," so the old legend ran.

Nicholas related his story and preached his crusade before
the cathedral to the pilgrims who came to view the relics.
These pilgrims carried the story of Nicholas back to their
homes and there soon came a number of children to him at
Cologne. He also sent out assistants to preach the crusade
in different parts of the land. The excitement became even
greater than in France for bands of children came into
Cologne in even greater numbers than to St. Denys. This
was a more mixed crowd than that of Stephen, as there
were more girls and more adults and especially more lewd
women, so many of these latter that the chroniclers referred
to them often and attributed to them the greater part of the
evils that came upon the multitude. These crusaders had a
uniform, which consisted of a long gray coat, with a cross
sewed upon the breast, and they wore broad brimmed hats
and carried a palmer's staff. In about a month the host had
gathered and was ready to start for the sea, which was to let
them pass through to the Holy Land, as with the army of
Stephen. But there arose a division and only a part started
under the leadership of Nicholas.

Those who remained with Nicholas left Cologne for Genoa
in June or July, 1212. The number that started was said to
have been twenty thousand, the majority being boys under
twelve years of age. Nicholas took his place at the head and
at a signal the start was made, with banners flying and the
singing of hymns. But this was not true of all the parents
and friends, for many of them were in great distress over
the leaving of their children, and they followed for some[Pg 307]
distance pleading for them to give up and return to their
homes. One of the songs of this band comes down to us.
Gray219 states that an account of the discovery of this hymn
may be found in a magazine, the Evangelical Christendom for
May, 1850, and that Hecker asserts it was used by the children.
It was in German, coming from Westphalia, and had
been used before by Crusaders on their journey to Palestine.
The English translation is as follows:



"Fairest Lord Jesus,
Ruler of all nature,
Thou of Mary and of God the Son!
Thee will I cherish,
Thee will I honor,
Thee my soul's glory, joy, and crown!


"Fair are the meadows,
Fairer still the woodlands,
Robed in the blooming garb of spring;
Jesus is fairer,
Jesus is purer,
Who makes our saddened heart to sing.


"Fair is the sunshine,
Fairer still the moonlight,
And the sparkling, starry host;
Jesus shines brighter,
Jesus shines purer,
Than all the angels heaven can boast."



They took their way along the Rhine, they entered into
Switzerland going by way of Geneva, their route through the
Alps was over Mont Cenis, entering Italy in what is now
Piedmont, and from thence to Genoa. At that time the region
along the Rhine was not much peopled, a feudal castle rising
here and there on some prominent crag with hamlets below,
but most of the way was almost a wilderness and with plenty
of wild animals such as stags and boars and wolves and bears.
The children suffered much, especially from lack of food and
shelter. The children also were carried off by the robber
barons. The children were preyed upon by the hangers-on
and thieves and the degraded men and women and they were
soon without control, and the band became but little more
than a rabble. But their sufferings along the Rhine were
quite small as compared with what took place in traversing
the Alps. The trials and sufferings were so great that many[Pg 308]
of them succumbed and a large number gave up and turned
back. The summit was reached and in the monastery there
they were helped with food and shelter and afforded a time to
rest before going on with their journey. They went on and
came into Italy where they had hoped to receive kind treatment,
but instead they were treated harshly, robbed, refused
entrance into the towns, seized by the lords and carried away
as slaves. Finally they came to a place where they saw Genoa
from a mountain and then they felt that their sufferings were
over. They again recognized Nicholas as their prophet and
leader and with crosses aloft, banners unfurled, and hymns
sung in praise, they hurried down to the sea to enter the path
that surely would be opened to them to go over to the Holy
Land.

As was stated, twenty thousand started with Nicholas at
Cologne, but after the hard journey of seven hundred miles,
there were only seven thousand that reached Genoa in August,
1212. But these were the very best for only the strongest kept
on and could endure the hardships. Like the children at
Marseilles, they asked to remain in Genoa but one night as on
the morrow God was to open the sea to them that they might
continue on their journey. The authorities at first granted
them permission to remain six or seven days but on the very
same day this time was shortened to one day, as it was feared
they might become lawless and again there was fear of famine,
but most of all the Genoese feared the displeasure of the
Pope, who at that time was in conflict with the German Emperor,
and of course these children were subjects of the Emperor.
The children agreed to this, as they said they wanted
but one night as they would go on through the sea in the
morning. The gates were then opened and the children entered
and marched through the streets singing, with crosses
uplifted and banners flying. The night was passed and in
the morning they rushed to the seashore, but as with the other
children so with these, for they waited in vain for the sea
to open.

When the senate at Genoa had taken back their offer to let
the children remain six or seven days and gave them permission
to remain but one day, they did extend an invitation
to all those who would like to make Genoa their permanent
home to do so, and they would be received as citizens. At the
time the offer was made it was rejected by all as they were
anticipating that on the morrow the sea would open and a[Pg 309]
path would be provided for a way to Palestine. After the
sea did not open, many of the children were convinced that
their journey was ended and they decided to accept the offer
and to remain at Genoa. There were quite a number that so
decided, and they became citizens and some of the youth grew
to become wealthy and prominent men and some joined themselves
with patrician families, being of noble German birth,
and several great families were so founded, among such being
one great princely house.

Those who did not wish to remain at Genoa left on the following
day after their entry. Outside the gates a council was
held and they decided to go on their way by land to Palestine
as far as they could. After this there was no further organization,
and Nicholas is not heard of again. They went to Pisa
and from here two shiploads of children set sail for the Holy
Land, but there is nothing known of them further. The remnant
went on to Rome and were received by the Pope who
talked to them kindly and advised them to give up their
march, but he held them to their vows and told them that
when they reached manhood they should go forth to fight for
the redemption of the Holy Sepulcher. These young people
then gave up their enterprise and prepared to return home.

It is not known who was the leader of the band that separated
from that one led by Nicholas. It is thought that when
this band left Cologne it was as large as that which went out
with Nicholas. They took a different route, going through
Swabia to Switzerland and crossing the Alps at the Pass of
St. Gotthard and entered Italy in Lombardy. They traversed
the entire length of Italy to Brindisi. This company
was composed of about the same elements as the other one and
they met with even greater difficulties and hardships and
became even more lawless. They were treated very badly
everywhere in Italy. At Brindisi a number of them embarked
on ships and sailed away for Palestine and that was the last
ever heard of them.

The return of the German children was sadder than their
going. In Italy, having to obtain food and clothing in any
way possible, they contracted the worst of vices. So on their
return they were no longer a religious throng hurrying on to
save the Cross, but a rabble, with no respect for any one and
no one had respect for them. Hence they were treated badly
on the way back and only found a refuge when arriving each
one in his own home.[Pg 310]

This Crusade shows the great danger to which child-nature
may be subjected in times of great excitement and teaches the
need of the careful guarding of children from such. In this
Crusade it is estimated that more than thirty thousand children
never saw their homes after leaving. In all near a
hundred thousand children went from their homes, leaving
sixty thousand sorrowing families behind them. Perhaps not
one of these children who returned home came back with the
purity with which he or she started.


Other Child-pilgrimages. "The second children's pilgrimage
falls only twenty-five years later; so that the assumption
of a morbid excitability of the child-world at all this time
appears to be justified. It was confined to the city of Erfurt,
and the phenomenon was very transient, but not the less
presents all the distinctive marks of a religious convulsion,
and exhibited more of disease than other child-pilgrimages, as
far at least as has come down to posterity. On the 15th July,
1237, there assembled, unknown to their parents, more than
1,000 children, left the town by the Löber Gate, and wandered,
dancing and leaping, by the Steigerwald to Armstadt. A
congress such as this, as if by agreement, resembles an instinctive
impulse as in animals, when, for instance, swallows
and storks collect for their migration; the same phenomenon
has doubtless taken place in all children's pilgrimages, it was
also remarked by eye-witnesses of the first of them, in a
manner characteristic of the Middle Ages. It was not till
the next day that the parents learned the occurrence, and they
fetched their children back in carts. No one could say who
had enticed them away. Many of them are said to have continued
ill some time after, and in particular to have suffered
from trembling of the limbs, perhaps also from convulsions.
The whole affair is obscure, and so little account has been
taken of it by contemporaries, that the chronicles only speak
of the fact, and say nothing of its causes. The only probable
conjecture is that the many noisy and pompous festivities connected
with the canonization of St. Elizabeth, the Landgravine
of Thuringia, had excited in the child-world of Erfurt this
itch for devotion, which sought to relieve itself by displays of
spinal activity. For this child-pilgrimage is in very near
proximity to the Dancing Mania.

"Still much more obscure is a child-pilgrimage of 1458, of
which the motives were quite clearly religious. It is probably,
at present, almost impossible to trace the chain of ideas which[Pg 311]
occasioned it; it is enough that it was in honor of the Archangel
Michael. More than 100 children from Hall, in Suabia,
set out, against the will of their parents, for Mont St. Michel
in Normandy. They could not by any means be restrained,
and if force was employed, they fell severely ill, and some
even died. The mayor, unable to prevent the journey, kindly
furnished them a guide for the long journey, and an ass to
carry their luggage. They are said to have actually reached
the then world-renowned Abbey, and to have performed their
devotions there. We have absolutely no other information of
them, and it appears that this child-pilgrimage, which falls
to the time when chorea was very frequent and widely spread
in Germany, has excited even much less attention than the
migration of the children of Erfurt in the year 1237."220

CHAPTER XII

THE CHILD IN EARLIER UNITED STATES



Customs Relating to Land. The settlers in the United
States brought with them many of their old-world customs
and some of these early customs relating to land seem to us
now most curious. Society has ever been influenced by the
manner of holding, transferring, and inheriting land, and
this all the more in a new country and especially where
greatly influenced by customs and laws transferred from
other countries.

One very old and peculiar custom was brought over from
England and used by the first colonists. This was the transferring
of land under the old ceremony of the livery of seizin,
a feudal ceremony. When land was being sold, the owner
would stand upon it and he would pluck a twig from the tree
or bush and place it in the hand of the purchaser, or he would
take a small piece of the turf and stick a twig in it and give
over to the purchaser. If a house was sold, the owner would
take hold of the ring or latch of the door and formally give
over the house to the purchaser.

In Virginia once every four years between Easter and
Whit Sunday, the owner of a piece of ground had to go
over the boundary and renew the marks, and when a piece of
land had been thus traced three times, the right to possess it
by the owner was never afterward disputed. Another custom
was feudal in its nature. The land of the new country
was given out in grants by the King and the owners acknowledged
allegiance to him and paid annual dues and these proprietors
established a system of land-tenure in which they
let out the land, and an annual due was always expected.
This was sometimes paid in money and again in produce from
the land, sometimes being a very small amount, just sufficient
to show acknowledgment of feudal service, it might be a few
pounds of butter or a couple of loads of wood or a pair of
chickens. In Virginia the first tenants were little better than
villains of feudal times, as when they received land they were[Pg 314]
bound to remain seven years on it and to pay one-half of the
whole produce as rent.

In New England and also in some parts of New York and
New Jersey, there was the custom of holding land in common       upland,
meadow, and woodland were apportioned out
for use to the different members of the community. The
church was a great binding force among them, so that the
meeting-house was the center about which the people settled,
and they were kept all the more closely together by the hostile
savages.

But in a new country where land was plentiful and easy
to obtain and laws difficult of enforcement, the customs of an
old and thickly peopled country could not long hold, and particularly
so if unsuited to the needs of the new country. Yet
such were enduring enough in this country as to have wielded
quite an influence.


The People. Only a fringe along the eastern part of this
country was settled at this time. Too, this part was not all
peopled by the same nationality as there were English, Dutch,
Swede, German, and French, and there was not much if any
mixing among them. When all this territory came under
England, then there was more intercommunication but not
even then a great deal on account of the difficulties of travel.
There, too, grew up, quite a distinction between the people
of the northern part and those of the southern part. The
southern part was much better suited for cultivation under
the systems of that time and it became a farming community,
with large farms and the people were not close together and
there were not many towns and cities. In the northern
part farming could not be carried on nearly so successfully,
and so manufacturing and commerce grew, both of which
demanded that people should live in towns and cities. The
separation of the people in the South and the wealth obtained
through agriculture made them most generous and hospitable.
In the North and especially in New England the hard struggle
for maintenance and the living together in communities
narrowed the people, till there was a selfishness displayed
by each town for its own. In the South strangers were welcome
and really wanted as there often was not great opportunity
for the people being much together or of learning of
outside affairs, so that the stranger could tell them of the
doings of the outside world and thus give entertainment for
hospitality. In New England, especially among the early[Pg 315]
people, there grew up a suspicion of all newcomers and particularly
strangers, and often it went so far that a stranger
could not acquire property in a town and so could not gain
a legal residence. It went yet further in some places, for
the people of a town were not encouraged even to have their
relatives from outside visit them.

"The primitive land systems lasted long enough to exert
a considerable influence upon the people. If we consider
extreme examples this becomes evident. The inhabitant of
the town community was trained to association with his fellows.
Measures were taken to promote village life; laws were
made in Connecticut, in 1650, against consolidating house-lots,
and the dwellers in Andover were forbidden to live upon
their plow-land, lest their hogs and cattle should injure the
common meadows. Artisans were secured by the community.
Newark, for example, reserved a lot for the miller, another
for the town's tailor, another for the boatman, and so on. A
town in one case kept a flock of sheep for the public benefit.
The habit of coöperation promoted voluntary associations.
We find one New England mill owned by seven shareholders,
another by thirteen, and a third by fourteen. The towns in
New England and New York made by-laws, and regulated
their internal concerns in field and town meetings. The
system was productive of no end of petty wrangling and
neighborhood feuds, but it cultivated a democratic feeling
and taught each man to maintain his right.

"On the other hand, the Southern planter lived in some
isolation, but his public interests were as extensive as his
county or his province. This state of society begot self-reliance,
and produced more leading statesmen than the
other; but the people lacked the New England cohesion and
susceptibility to organization, without which the statesmanship
of the Revolution would have been in vain. The Southerner,
from his isolation and from other causes, became hospitable,
eager for society, and in general spontaneously
friendly and generous; the New England people became close-fisted
and shrewd in trade, it is a trait of village life. But
the benevolence of New England was more effective than
that of the South, because it was organized and systematic.
The village life of the extreme North trained the people to
trade, and led to commercial development; and it made popular
education possible. The sons of the great planters at the
South were averse to commerce; they were also the most lib[Pg 316]erally
educated and polished in manners of all the colonists;
but the scattered common people could have no schools, and
were generally rude and ignorant, even when compared with
the lower class of New Englanders, who stood a chance of
getting some rough schooling, besides a certain education
from the meeting-house and the ever-recurring town debates."221


Slavery. In 1619 the first negroes were brought to the
colonists. They were carried to Jamestown by a Dutch ship
and fourteen of them were bought by the people and remained
at Jamestown. They were kept as slaves and their work
proved so profitable that more were brought in and this continued
till there were quite a number in the colonies. Not
only in Virginia, but in all the colonies, both North and
South, slaves from Africa were used. At the beginning of the
eighteenth century, the colonies tried to put a check on the
slave-trade but it had proved so profitable to the English
ship owners who carried on the traffic in African slaves, that
the mother-country favored them and would not allow laws
of the colonies against the slave trade to be enforced.

For a long time but a few women were brought over in the
slave ships and many of the slaves were from wild tribes in
Africa and so they were fierce and dangerous. They committed
many crimes and were severely punished. Some of
the punishments were most cruel, as the hanging in chains,
and burning. Other punishments were whipping, cropping
the ears, hamstringing, branding in the face, and slitting
the nose. As slavery could be much more profitably used in
the South, there were, of course, more negroes taken there,
and so it was the home of much of the cruel treatment. But
the North had it share in such, as is shown in the following
quotations:

"In colonies where the statutes did not warrant extraordinary
penalties on slaves, the administration of law went
to the limit of severity. In Massachusetts hanging was the
worst penalty for murder, but the obsolete common-law punishment
specially assigned to women who were guilty of petty
treason was revived in 1755, in order to burn alive a slave-woman
who had killed her master in Cambridge; earlier still
the old lex talionis had been put in force, that a negro woman
might die by fire in Boston for arson causing death. In New[Pg 317]
Jersey, even in that part of the province in which Quakerism
should have softened the spirit of the people, negroes were
burned in many instances. New York, without the excuse
of serious danger       for her negroes were not more than a
sixth of the population       had a code barely less fierce than
that of South Carolina, where the multitude of the slaves was
a perpetual danger to the whites. Some of the revolting
penalties inflicted on slaves in New York with the sanction
of law-courts are striking proofs of the small advance the
men of that time had made from positive barbarism."222

"Though in the beginning he refused to harbor or tolerate
negro-stealers, the Massachusetts Puritan of that day, enraged
at the cruelty of the savage red men, did not hesitate
to sell Indian captives as slaves to the West Indies. King
Phillip's wife and child were thus sold and there died. Their
story was told in scathing language by Edward Everett. In
1703 it was made legal to transport and sell in the Barbadoes
all Indian male captives under ten, and Indian women captives.
Perhaps these transactions quickly blunted whatever
early feeling may have existed against negro slavery, for soon
the African slave-trade flourished in New England, as in
Virginia, Newport being the New England center of the
Guinea trade. From 1707 to 1732 a tax of three guineas a
head was imposed in Rhode Island on each negro imported       on
'Guinea blackbirds.' It would be idle to dwell now on the
cruelty of that horrid traffic, the sufferings on board the
slavers from lack of room, of food, of water, of air. But
three feet three inches was allowed between decks for the poor
negro, who, accustomed to a free, out-of-door life, thus
crouched and sat through the passage. No wonder the loss
of life was great. It was chronicled in the newspapers and
letters of the day in cold, heartless language that plainly
spoke the indifference of the public to the trade and its awful
consequence. I have never seen in any Southern newspapers
advertisements of negro sales that surpass in heartlessness
and viciousness the advertisement of our New England newspapers
of the eighteenth century. Negro children were advertised
to be given away in Boston, and were sold by the
pound as was other merchandise. Samuel Pewter advertised
in the Weekly Rehearsal in 1737 that he would sell horses for
ten shillings pay if the horse sale were accomplished, and five
shillings if he endeavored to sell and could not; and for[Pg 318]
negroes 'sixpence a pound on all he sells, and a reasonable
price if he does not sell.'"223

The Dutch of New Netherlands had negro slaves but it
would seem they differed from the English colonists in that
they treated their slaves with kindness. Masters were placed
under bonds and they were not permitted to whip their
slaves without authorization from the government.

When more slave-women were brought in and negro families
were established, the slaves became less fierce and more
willing to accept their lot. Too, the children born to them
learned to use the English language as their own and took up
the ways of their masters and families and the old savage
doings were for the most part forgotten. Cruelty to the
slaves then decreased and new and less cruel laws were made
for their government and control or the old laws and barbarous
punishments were not enforced or used against them.
The revolutionary movement did a great deal toward giving
the negroes a better legal standing. This was particularly
true in reference to free negroes and Indians, for many of
the discriminations against them were abolished.


Servants. With the settlement of this country, there came
a great need for laborers. As was given in the foregoing, the
slave trade arose and negroes were brought over and sold as
slaves, and also Indians taken in war were used as slaves.
But these sources were not sufficient to meet the demand for
laborers and this caused the importation of white help from
Europe. These people were brought to America and bound
out for a term of service, which, before 1650, was sometimes
as long as ten years and often for seven or eight years, and
then the time was made four or five years for all the colonies.
These people were of three classes       those who because of
debt in the old country or of poverty or from other causes
bound themselves out for a term of years in which they were
to pay their way, and were known as "redemptioners"; the
second kind were those who had been trapped or induced to
go on board ship and then carried off to America, and were
known as "kids"; and the third class were criminals, convicted
and transported for crime.

In the first class, the redemptioners, were found English
laborers who bound themselves to service in America, hoping
thereby to better their condition. Men and women in domestic
trouble, men having wives with whom they could not or[Pg 319]
would not live and women having unbearable husbands,
placed themselves in this number. Men who were in debt
and threatened with imprisonment sold themselves out to
save themselves. Beside these there were many others who
wished to go to America, but did not have the funds for the
passage, who bound themselves out for service and thus secured
the passage and a place for work, with the opportunity
to redeem themselves within four years.

The second class, "kids," were obtained through people
who were called "spirits." These parties had been engaged
in spiriting away men who were turned over to the military
authorities to become soldiers, and when the demand for laborers
for America became such as to offer opportunities for
great profit, these "spirits" turned their trade into procuring
people to satisfy this want of the new county. These men
were particularly active in kidnapping children. Among a
shipload of such children offered for sale in Boston one day
in 1730, there was a boy who had sailed from America with
his uncle who was the captain of the ship. The uncle died at
sea and the mate and crew sold the boy to a transport-ship
which was passing them bound for this country. The boy
served out his term and later became an officer in the wars
with the Indians. One noteworthy case was that of James
Annesley, son and heir of Lord Altham. When thirteen years
of age he was taken from Dublin, at the instigation of his
uncle, and carried to America and he served twelve years of
bondage in Pennsylvania. After this service he returned to
his native land and brought suit to recover his father's titles
and estates. This suit was successful but it was appealed to
the House of Lords and the young man died before the decision
was reached.

Not only were criminals that were convicted sent to America,
but when a man was on trial for a small crime the officers
of the court would make him believe that he would suffer
severe punishment, perhaps hanging, so that he would beg for
transportation. Then these prisoners were sold and the
money would be kept by the officers. They even went further,
for innocent persons were arrested and condemned that
they might be sold into the colonies. However strong were the
needs of the colonists for laborers, yet they did not want these
convicts and protested against their coming in. Some of the
colonial assemblies passed laws against such importation but
England would not accept such laws as this course afforded[Pg 320]
too good a way of getting rid of criminals. "The hardest
words said against the mother country in colonial prints, a
quarter of a century before the Revolution, sprang from the
bitter resentment excited by this practice of forcing criminals
on the plantations in spite of their utmost endeavor to keep
them out. One of the most pungent newspaper writers of
the time compared England to a father seeking to spread the
plague among his children, or emptying filth upon their table;
and Franklin proposed to send a present of rattlesnakes for
the king's garden, as a fit return for the convicts out of
English jails."224

Not only were English laborers sent to the colonies, but
also great numbers of Germans were got to sell themselves,
sailing from Dutch ports to Philadelphia. Some of these Germans
were of such a saving turn that though they had sufficient
funds to pay their fare to America, they preferred to
sell themselves out for a number of years in order to get free
transportation. Others would pay half their fare, while still
others would pay their passage by selling some of their children
to service during their minority. As the country developed
out from Philadelphia, these Germans with others
would be taken out in droves of fifty or more by the "soul-drivers,"
men who would peddle them out to those needing
such service. Also there were a large number of Irish imported.

The colonists themselves helped to meet the demand for
help, as they would sell the town-poor out to the lowest bidder,
the one who would agree to take the least from the town
for their support. They, too, sold the criminals into service
to work out their sentences. Children from the almshouses
were likewise bound out for a term of service. Beside all
these kinds of help, there were servant-girls and serving-men,
sometimes from well-to-do families, and this was particularly
true before there were so many slaves and bondsmen sent into
the colonies from over the sea.

The laborers that were brought into the colonies from
Europe were not altogether the most desirable persons. Even
if not from the criminal classes they were too often people
not of great account in their old homes and they carried to
their new homes the elements that made them shiftless and[Pg 321]
continued so to keep them. Too, they were often a source
of moral corruption, the degradation of the women-servants
being a continued source of evil. The thrifty New Englanders
complained a great deal about these servants, as being lazy
and trifling and of a thieving and lying disposition, anything
than worthy help. Too, there were many runaways. Yet
among these there were many who were valuable and of good
disposition and upright in character. This class gave to this
country some families of honorable distinction. As women
were scarce in the new country, many of these bondmaids
married those who purchased them or married into their families.
The larger part of these people, when their time of
bondage was completed, entered into the class of small farmers
or free laborers. There was another element that pushed
out across the frontier of settlements to get away from law
and civilization and built up centers where lawlessness has
ever prevailed. Still others became the ancestors of shiftless
and pauper and criminal families which prevail in different
sections of this country, both North and South.

It is surprising at the number of bond-servants that were
in the colonies. They were used in all kinds of business and
it seemed impossible to do without them. It is stated that in
Virginia in 1670 there were six thousand English servants
and but two thousand negroes. When it is considered that
these bondmen served but for four years, the importations
must have been great to keep up the numbers.

When there were not a great number of bond-servants, they
became well known to the families with whom they lived and
they were well treated and well cared for. As the numbers
increased, and especially when convicts and other evil characters
were brought in, the treatment changed and often was
quite cruel. As flogging was one of the main punishments of
the world at that time, it was greatly used in the colonies,
the servants being whipped naked with hickory rods and then
rubbed with brine. There were also other ways of punishment,
one being the use of thumb-screws.

The sick servant, too, might not be cared for, especially if
quite ill and likely to die, as he was not considered worth the
physician's bill. Often the slaves were treated better than
the servants, for the slaves were property while the servants
were freed at the end of four years. Later laws were enacted
in the colonies for the protection of the servants and cruel[Pg 322]
punishments prohibited. There were plenty of instances of
fair treatment of servants by masters and sometimes even
they were treated quite kindly and generously.


The Home. When the first colonists came to America, they
were poorly equipped for preparing dwelling places for
themselves. There were plenty of trees for boards, abundance
of clay for brick, limestone in plenty for plaster and
mortar, and rocks of all kinds for building purposes, but the
settlers did not possess implements with which to put these
natural materials into forms for their use. Consequently
they lived at first in primitive fashion. Some would take
for their home the dense foliage of a tree, living under its
protection, while others dwelt in hollow trees. Some made
for themselves caves, by digging into a bank or hill, supporting
the sides with brush and poles, and covering it with poles
over which were laid sod or bark or rushes.

It was natural for the early settlers to imitate the dwellings
of the native inhabitants, and so wigwams were used by them.
They made them of bark or of plaited rush or grass mats or
of deerskin, all placed over a frame, or even they might
simply pile brush about the frame, and in the far South these
frames were covered with layers of palmetto leaves. In the
Middle and Southern states, with their milder climate, these
wigwams sometimes were left open on one side       the "half-face
camp"       the fire being built in front of the opening.
Sometimes this half-face camp was made more substantial
by being built of logs, and again in some cases it was only
a booth, with sides and roof of palmetto leaves.

The early settler did have one implement which became
wonderfully useful to him, which was the ax. He soon learned
to use this in making for himself and family a more permanent
dwelling-place, the log cabin. At first the log cabin was
of round logs, notched at the ends, and fitted together at the
corners, roofed with logs or with bark on poles, having a door
of rough slabs and hung on wooden hinges or straps of hide,
and if a window, with a shutter similar to the door, and without
floor or loft. Then came a floor of rough puncheons hewn
out with ax and the cracks between the logs were chinked with
pieces of wood and daubed over with clay. A chimney was
made at one end out of sticks of wood with ends crossed and
held together with clay and well plastered inside with clay,
called in New England, a "katted" chimney. It was not
very long till better houses were built. The logs were hewn[Pg 323]
and squared, clapboards were made for covering, and oiled
paper was used in the windows. Then came the use of boards
and stone and brick and plaster and nails and, later, paint
and glass, and some substantial houses were built. There
grew up a style of home for the different parts of the country,
corresponding to the needs of each section and, no doubt,
aided by imitation of the old country, as, in the South, in
Pennsylvania and neighboring parts of New Jersey and
Delaware, with the Dutch in New York and in New England.

The most notable Southern home was that of the wealthy
planter, which would seem to have been fashioned somewhat
after the old English manor. This Southern home was in
a spacious home-lot or yard, with a large lawn in front and
usually with fine trees about it. There was a large, pretentious
house, the home of the owner, and grouped about it
were more or fewer smaller buildings, as, kitchen, overseer's
house, negro cabins, stable, coach-house, hen-house, smoke-house,
dove-cote, milk-room, tool-house, brew-house, spinning-house,
and not far away, a cider-house.

The Quakers and Germans of Pennsylvania and neighboring
parts were quite different people from the Southerners
and lived quite a different life. The manor style of home did
not exist with them. The country houses were substantial
but not pretentious, made of hewed logs and some of stone
or brick, while the barns were large, sometimes vast. By each
house was a clay oven and nearby a smoke-house. There was
usually a small building enclosing a spring, known as the
spring house, for caring for the milk and butter and other
things during warm weather. Often there was no shade
about the dwelling-house, being open to the sun.

In New York the homes took the form of those the Dutch
were used to back in Holland. The houses were built near
the sidewalk with the gable-end to the street, the top of
the gable showing in corbel-steps. They were built of brick,
or at least the gable-ends were, imported from Holland, and
the date of erection and the owner's initials were shown by
bricks of different colors from the others. The roof was quite
steep and at first thatched but later tiles were used, and with
a metal gutter projecting well out into the street. There
was a weather-vane at the top of the house, which might have
been a horse, lion, goose, or fish, but the prevailing fashion
was a rooster. The front door was usually divided in the
middle horizontally, making an upper and a lower half,[Pg 324]
hung on leather hinges and, later on, heavy iron hinges, and
in the upper half were placed two bull's-eyes of heavy greenish
glass. Often the front door had a knocker of iron or
brass. The Dutch farmhouse was similar to the town house,
as described above, but the cellar was built more carefully as
it was necessary to be cool in summer and warm in winter to
care for the great supply of food that was stored in it.
After the English came to New York, the Dutch styles were
changed to English styles and the houses of the landed gentry
became quite similar to those of the Southern planters.

After the primitive sheltering as described in the first
paragraphs under this section, "The Home," the people of
New England built log houses, as in the other colonies, and
for near a half century, there was scarcely any house larger
than a cottage. These houses were thatched and had the katted
chimneys. Oiled paper was used for admitting light,
glass coming into use later. Paint was not used at all at
first and very little used for quite awhile, either without or
within the house.

After half a century, particularly in the older settlements
in New England, they began to build larger houses       many of
two stories and also an attic story. In building these the
second story was made to project a foot or two out over the
first story and the attic story also projected out over the second
story, which was like their old homes in England. Later
came another form of house, which was almost peculiar to
New England. In this the house was two and a half stories
in front, with a sharp gable, then with a long slope back to
a low story. The low back part of the house was called the
"lean-to" or linter. A later style of house was that with
the gambrel roof, in which the upper part of the roof was of a
rather flat slope and then there was a change to quite a steep
slope for the lower part of the roof. There was usually a
chimney in the center of these larger houses, of whatever style
of house, made of stone or brick. "Some of the dwellings of
the rich were very commodious; the house of Eaton, the first
governor of New Haven colony, had nineteen fire-places, and
that of Davenport, the first minister of New Haven, had
thirteen."225

In the very early times of the colonists there was but little
furniture in their homes and that of the rudest kind. As
wealth came to them and their houses grew in size and splen[Pg 325]dor,
the furniture increased in amount and value. The following
well portrays this.

"The inventories of the household effects of many of the
early citizens of New York might be given, to show the furnishings
of these homes. I choose the belongings of Captain
Kidd to show that 'as he sailed, as he sailed' he left a very
comfortable home behind him. He was, when he set up house-keeping
with his wife Sarah in 1692, not at all a bad fellow,
and certainly lived well. He possessed these handsome and
abundant house furnishings:


One dozen Turkey work chairs.

The floors were not carpeted in colonial times till late in
the period, and, really, a carpet in those days was not to place
on a floor but it was a cover for a table or cupboard. Sometimes
sand was placed over the parlor floor and marked off[Pg 326]
into ornamental figures. The walls of the rooms were wainscoted
and painted. In some of the houses of the wealthy,
there were hung on the walls rich cloths and tapestries and
sometimes leathern hangings and in later times there were
paper-hangings of strong and heavy material. The ceilings
were usually left entirely open, showing the beams and rafters,
often rough hewn. Prints were placed on the walls,
beings pictures of ships, battle scenes, and the like, and there
were paintings, usually portraits of ancestors.

Cupboards were found in all the houses and they were of
various kinds and sizes, to fit into different places and for
many uses. One parlor piece was a kind of writing-desk, the
scrutaire, spelled in many ways in old inventories and at
present time secretary. There were tables of many kinds.
There were dressers and dressing-glasses in frames of walnut
and olive-wood and with gilt and japanned frames. The
chest was an indispensable piece of furniture and there were
all kinds and sizes and of different woods and some had most
beautiful carvings and inlayings. These chests were greatly
needed for each household had an abundance of household
linen and many a goodly quantity of silver. The time was
told by means of sun-dials and hour-glasses, but there were
also numbers of watches and clocks among the colonists and
later there were all kinds of clocks for sale.

Chairs were in use very little, if at all, in early colonial
days, as stools and benches took their place. Later chairs
were greatly in use and of many kinds. There were three
general kinds       turned chairs, in which the seats were often
of flags and rushes; wainscot chairs, being all of wood, including
backs and seats; and covered chairs, sometimes covered
with leather and again with rich cloths, velvets, etc. Cane
chairs were not introduced into the colonies till quite a late
period.

The one piece of furniture that more than any other was
a distinguishing mark of class was the bed, which graded
from none at all in the cabin of the very poor to the great
bed of state in the parlor of the very wealthy. There was,
sometimes from poverty, sometimes from other causes, no
bed in the house of a colonist, all sleeping on the floor, usually
though, having placed on it deer, buffalo, or bear skins.
Sometimes a pallet of bed-clothing was spread on the floor.
In other homes there was but one bed for the father and
mother, the rest of the family sleeping on the floor. Some[Pg 327]times
the bed was nothing more than a wooden box
with bedding on it. The primitive fashion of sleeping on the
floor might have occurred in any or all of the homes of the
very early settlers and especially so when they lived in caves
and wigwams and under trees, but it was not very long till
beds were brought in from Europe or made in this country
and there became a great variety in style and price.

The trundle-bed was used, being pushed under a high bedstead
in the daytime. There were sometimes two standing
and two trundle beds in one room. A common form of bed
in the early times of the colonists was one that was built into
an alcove or recess in a room, somewhat like a bench, with
doors about it, which were kept closed to shut the bed off from
view when not being used. Another form of bed was the
slawbank. The slawbank was a frame with a cord bottom, fastened
to the wall of the room on one side with hinges and on
the other side having two legs to hold it up from the floor.
When not in use this bed could be pulled up and hooked
against the wall and there were closet-like doors to shut it in
or curtains to drop down over it to hide it from view. The
bed of all beds was the state-bed, the household idol, kept
in the parlor, and not even shown to vulgar eyes and used
only on very rare occasions. This was a great carved four-poster,
very costly, with richly embroidered coverlets and
hangings of brilliant hues.

There was no lack of bedding after the early struggles, as
there were good feather beds with coverlets of all kinds, an
abundance of linen sheets, and also flannel sheets were used,
but cotton sheets were not plentiful. There were bolsters
and pillows and coverings for them. "Such poor people in
the colonies as had tastes too luxurious to enjoy a deerskin on
the hearth were accustomed to fill their bed-sacks and pillows
with fibrous mistletoe, the down of the cat-tail flag, or with
feathers of pigeons slaughtered from the innumerable migrating
flocks. The cotton from the milkweed, then called 'silk-grass,'
was used for pillows and cushions. In the houses of
the prosperous, good feather and even down beds were in use.
The Pennsylvania German smothered and roasted himself
between two of these even in summer nights and sometimes
without sheets or pillows."227

The furniture of those early days was usually set up from
the floor on legs, as, chests of drawers, dressing-cases, side-boards,[Pg 328]
and the like were often a foot off the floor, so that
they could be thoroughly swept under. Cooking utensils, too,
were often set on feet, such as pots, kettles, gridirons, skillets,
and the other sorts, which was for the purpose of placing
them above the coals and ashes of the open fireplace.

The early dining-table was a board placed on trestles, which
was called a table-board. As boards were quite scarce, often
these table-boards were made from boxes and chests which
came from England containing goods. It was not long, however
till there were tables of different kinds. One kind, called
a drawing-table, had leaves so that it could be extended, a
kind of extension-table. Another kind had flaps at either
end which could be turned down on hinges or held up by
means of brackets. There was another kind in which by the
use of hinges the top could be fixed for a table or turned
about to form the back of a chair. Usually a long, narrow
bench, without a back, was used with the table-board instead
of stools or chairs, and the children did not always get to use
this bench as they often had to stand behind the older people
while eating.

As the table was called a table-board so the table-cloth was
called a board-cloth. Although the table-cloth might have
been coarse it was bleached out as white as any at present and
later there were quite a variety imported from the old country.
Napkins were in plenty, as many or more were in use
as at present. The principal article on the table was the
trencher, which ordinarily was a block of wood about a foot
square and three or four inches thick and hollowed out in the
middle into a sort of bowl. Into this the food was placed       porridge,
meat, vegetables, etc.       and two people ate from
one trencher, or there was a trencher for each person if the
family were quite extravagant in their ways. The next important
article was the salt-cellar, which was set in the center
of the table and quality folks were seated "above the salt,"
that is, toward the end where sat the host and hostess. The
abundance of napkins may be accounted for by the fact that
forks were not known to the early colonists. Spoons were in
general use and took the place of forks, as most of the food
was prepared for the use of the spoon. Porringers, little shallow
dishes with handles, were in great use and especially by
the children, and there was a kind, often without a handle,
called a posnet.

The cooking of the early times was done in fireplaces.[Pg 329]
There were various kinds of utensils for cooking, as pots,
kettles, gridirons, skillets, toasting-forks, frying-pans, and the
like. A very important utensil was the Dutch oven, with
which was used a long-handled shovel, the peel or slice, for
placing the food to be cooked well within the oven. One
important function of cooking was the proper roasting of
meats. At the first the roast was suspended from a string
over the fire, the string being given an occasional twist, usually
the task of a child. Then there was invented a metal
suspensory machine, which had clockwork to turn the roast
regularly. Also the turnspit dog was introduced into the
colonies, this dog being trained to work in a revolving cylinder
and thus keep the roast turning before the fire.

Many of the articles for the table were made of wood, such
as trenchers, tankards, bottles, cups, and dishes. The shells
of cocoanuts were made into goblets and dippers and often
mounted in pewter and sometimes even in silver. Horn was
used for spoons and drinking-cups. Pitchers, bottles, drinking-cups
and jugs were made of leather, which sometimes
were tipped with silver. Gourds were used for drinking-cups
and dippers. There were very few tin vessels among the
colonists and even iron was not so greatly in use, being used
for andirons and pots and pans and some other vessels. There
were brass and copper pots and kettles, which were quite
costly and highly prized by the owners and well cared for.
Silver was not greatly in use and yet quite a number of the
families had silver spoons and others also had silver drinking-cups,
salt-cellars, candle-sticks, and other kinds of silver
vessels. Pewter was the metal of the colonists. Much of the
tableware was made of this metal and found in each household.
There were spoons and plates and dishes and cups and
porringers and many other vessels of pewter. Often a family
prided itself on having a full pewter set and would keep it
as bright and shining as they would silverware, if they had
such. A good thing about pewter was that when dishes and
plates became worn they could easily be recast into new pewter
spoons. Glass was but little in use among the early colonists,
perhaps nothing beyond bottles, which though were of
different shapes and kinds and the glass was of a very coarse,
poor quality. Little chinaware, if any at all, was found
among the early colonists, and this, perhaps, only among the
Dutch settlers. Later, china was brought in and it increased
in use till in Revolutionary times it became to be common[Pg 330]
and to take the place of pewter. In the earlier times there
were some vessels of stoneware, such as drinking-jugs.

The colonial houses were heated by means of fireplaces and
in the kitchen the fireplace was also used for cooking. Some
of these fireplaces were very large, "sometimes wide enough
to drive a cart and horses between the jambs.... Logs
were sometimes drawn on to the ample hearth by a
horse."228 "In the old Phillips farmhouse at Wickford,
Rhode Island, is a splendid chimney over twenty feet
square."229 As fuel grew scarce, sometimes these fireplaces
were made smaller by closing them up in part and building
a "little chimney" within them. For holding the fuel in the
fireplace were andirons, which sometimes were of three sizes
to hold logs at different heights, and there were fire-dogs or
creepers, which were smaller than the andirons and were
placed between them. In the kitchen fireplace there also were
cob-irons, on which were hooks to hold the spit and dripping-pan,
and a crane or chain with pot-hooks to hold kettles. In
Pennsylvania the Germans had stoves. While the English
colonial house would have two chimneys, one at either end
and with a fireplace in each, the German house would have
a single chimney in the middle and use stoves. These stoves
were of different kinds. One kind was built from the outer
wall into the house, with the opening for feeding the stove
on the outside of the house and the back of the stove inside
the house. In the second story they sometimes had drums,
connected with the stoves, for heating the rooms there. Stoves
were later introduced into the other colonies, and especially
so as fuel became scarce. In 1742 Benjamin Franklin
brought out his "New Pennsylvania Fireplace," a rather
complicated affair, in which both wood and coal could
be used, and which later grew into the form now known as
the "Franklin Stove." As the bedrooms of the colonists
were freezing cold in winter, a warming-pan was used to heat
up the bed before getting into it for the night. The warming-pan
was round, about a foot wide and four or five inches
deep, with a perforated metal top and a long wooden handle.
This was filled with hot coals from the fireplace and placed
between the bed-linen and moved rapidly about for warming
without scorching the bedding. Wood, of course, was very
plentiful at first and it was used quite freely, the immense[Pg 331]
fireplaces consuming vast quantities of it. As the forests
disappeared and wood became scarce, especially in the towns,
coal was brought from across the ocean as it sometimes was
found to be cheaper when used with stoves than was the
wood.

"The discomfort of a colonial house in winter-time has been
ably set forth by Charles Francis Adams in his 'Three
Episodes of Massachusetts History.' Down the great chimneys
blew the icy blasts so fiercely that Cotton Mather noted
on a January Sabbath, in 1697, as he shivered before 'a great
Fire, that the Juices forced out at the end of short billets of
wood by the heat of the flame on which they were laid, yet
froze into ice on their coming out.' Judge Sewall wrote,
twenty years later, 'An Extraordinary Cold Storm of Wind
and Snow. Bread was frozen at Lord's Table.... Though
'twas so Cold yet John Tuckerman was baptized. At
six o'clock my ink freezes so that I can hardly write by a
good fire in my Wives Chamber'       and the pious man adds
(we hope in truth) 'Yet was very Comfortable at Meeting.'
Cotton Mather tells, in his pompous fashion, of a cold winter's
day four years later. ''Tis Dreadful cold, my ink glass in
my standish is froze and splitt in my very stove. My ink in
my pen suffers a congelation.' If sitting-rooms were such
refrigerators, we cannot wonder that the chilled colonists
wished to sleep in beds close curtained with heavy woolen
stuffs, or in slaw-bank beds by the kitchen fire.

"The settlers builded as well as they knew to keep their
houses warm; and while the vast and virgin forests supplied
abundant and accessible wood for fuel, Governor Eaton's
nineteen great fireplaces and Parson Davenport's thirteen,
could be well filled; but by 1744 Franklin could write of these
big chimneys as the 'fireplace of our fathers'; for the forests
had all disappeared in the vicinity of the towns, and the
chimneys had shrunk in size. Sadly did the early settlers
need warmer houses, for, as all antiquarian students have
noted, in olden days the cold was more piercing, began to
nip and pinch earlier in November, and lingered further into
spring; winter rushed upon the settlers with heavier blasts
and fiercer storms than we now have to endure. And, above
all, they felt with sadder force 'the dreary monotony of a
New England winter, which leaves so large a blank, so melancholy
a death-spot, in lives so brief that they ought to be
all summer-time.' Even John Adams in his day so dreaded[Pg 332]
the tedious bitter New England winter that he longed to
hibernate like a dormouse from autumn to spring."230

The early settlers learned from the Indians to use for light
the pine-knots of the pitch-pine. This was called candlewood
in New England and lightwood in the South. This wood was
split into pieces so as to be used as a kind of torch and because
of the smoke and the pitch droppings as it burned, it
was usually placed in a corner of the fireplace. As fish was
abundant in the streams, oil was obtained from them and
used in a rude kind of lamp, but it would seem that this fish
oil was not greatly used for light. Wax from bees was also
used, which was made into a kind of candle by heating the
wax and pressing it around a wick. Tallow and grease were
used in making rush lights, wherein the pith from the common
rushes was used, the outer covering being stripped off,
and then the pith was dipped into the heated tallow or grease
and this was then let harden. Deer suet, moose fat, and
bear's grease were saved and tried out for candles, but they
were not greatly used. Quite a good deal of wax from the
wax myrtle tree was gathered and used for candles, whose
berry has a thick coating of wax, and this tree was also
called the bayberry tree, tallow shrub, and candle-berry tree.
One great source for light came from the whale-fisheries, the
oil from the spermaceti whale furnishing quite an important
material for the making of candles. The most common of all
material and the greatest used was the tallow from the cattle,
which increased in number and became quite an important
industry in the colonies.

In the making of tallow candles there were candle-rods,
sticks about fifteen to eighteen inches long, and to each stick
were tied six to eight candle-wicks. The tallow was melted
and the wicks in the rods allowed to drop down and then
were dipped into the melted tallow. The rod was then placed
across the backs of two chairs or hung across two poles
placed across chairs or stools, and then a second stick would
be dipped and hung up to drip, and so on, and when the first
rod had dried sufficiently it was dipped a second time and it
was so continued to be dipped till the required sized candle
was made. Later moulds came into use, made of tin or pewter,
a half dozen individual moulds being joined together,
sometimes a dozen and sometimes as many as two dozen.
The wick was fastened to a nail or wire and then let down into[Pg 333]
the center of the mould, the nail holding across the top, and
the melted tallow was then poured in around the wick. The
making of candles in the first way required a good deal of
care and skill and it was slow work, two hundred candles a
day being considered an extra good day's work. When
moulds came into use, there were candle-makers who would
go from house to house with their moulds to make the needed
supply for the home. On account of the trouble in making
candles, the colonists were very careful of them. They were
carefully packed away and all pieces saved and also a little
contrivance, called a save-all, made of pins and rings, was
used to hold up the candle to the last till all was used. The
candles were sometimes placed in a rough candlestick made
of four pieces of wood fastened to a small piece of board so as
to form a receptacle for the candle, and also in rude chandeliers,
candle-beams, made of crossed sticks of wood. There
were candlesticks of pewter, iron, brass, and silver. There
also were sconces, called candle-arms or prongs. Snuffers
were used, and snuffers trays.

Lamps were in use by the colonists but the early ones were
of rude form. Among the earliest in use was the betty-lamp,
which consisted of a shallow basin, two or three inches wide
and an inch deep, with a nose or spout an inch or two long.
They were rectangular, oval, round, or triangular in shape.
They were set on the table or stand but often suspended from
a nail on the wall by a hook and chain attached to the lamp.
They were filled with tallow, grease, or oil and a cotton rag
or a coarse wick was placed in the contents and hung out
from the nose of the lamp. The phœbe-lamp was similar to
the betty-lamp, but some had a nose at either end and used a
double wick. The lamps were made of iron or pewter and
some of brass. Later glass lamps came into use and were of
various shapes and sizes.

The colonists had to be quite careful not to let the fire
go out in the fireplace for there were very poor means for
striking a light. In case there was no fire or light in the
house, some one would go to the home of a neighbor with a
shovel or covered pan, and sometimes with only a piece of
green bark, and get coals to bring back for relighting the fire.
This was usually the task of a small boy. For striking a
light, a flint and steel with tinder were used. By striking
the flint with the steel a spark was produced which was
caught by the tinder and was then blown into a flame.[Pg 334]
Another means was by setting off powder in the pan of a gun
of that time which would set a piece of tow on fire. Later,
matches were made by dipping small pieces of wood into
melted sulphur, which could be set on fire by placing them in
contact with the blaze on the hearth or of a light and then
they could be carried about to light fires and candles and
lamps. Such means of obtaining light were in use down to a
late time, for friction matches did not come into use until
the nineteenth century.


Women. During the earlier times in the settlement of
America, the women had a hard time. They had to endure
the hardships of a new country and to forego many of the
things that in an old country make women's lives the more
easy. They were never thought to be quite the equals of men
and the following well portrays how they were looked upon
by the men of the time:

"If some of our foremothers were intelligent and thoughtful,
it was rather by natural gift than from instruction. Men
of cultivation seem to have found it a little irksome to get
down to the level of topics deemed sufficiently simple for the
understanding of women. 'Conversation with ladies,' says
William Byrd, 'is liked whipped syllabub, very pretty, but
nothing in it.' The most accomplished gentlemen of that
time thought it necessary to treat their lady friends to flattery
so gross that it would not be bearable now. Byrd, great
lord that he was, repaid his lady friends for courteous and
hospitable entertainment at their houses by kissing them at
his departure, and excused himself for leaving one gentleman's
house by assuring the lady that her beauty would spoil
his devotions if he remained."231

"Yet the colonial usage kept women in retirement, the
colonial South had notable women that vied with their assertive
sisters of the North in the world of affairs. There
was no marked difference between the sections in the extent
to which women took up independent careers, or assumed responsibilities
beyond housewifery."232

"In South Carolina women took an active part in all sorts
of affairs and seem to have enjoyed a certain standing not
gained by women elsewhere in the colonies. The men often
had to be absent and it was not uncommon for a woman to
be alone for several months in charge of a great plantation[Pg 335]
with hundreds of slaves with no white man to assist her save
the overseer. Women often taught their own children. Eliza
Lucas studied law and while studying it drew up two wills
and was made trustee in another. In the Revolution the
women were often more stalwart than the men, urging husbands
and fathers not to give in in order to save their property
and bearing cheerfully hardship and banishment. In all
the Southern colonies there were keen gentlewomen that took
up tracts of land and cleared and cultivated their estates.
Southern women were not outdone by the business women of
the North."233

In the old Dutch times in New York, possibly women
touched closer to equality with men than in any other colony
or at any other time. They occupied so high a place that they
sometimes sat on juries. They engaged in business of various
kinds. They traded with the Indians, they engaged in commerce
with other colonies and the old country, they conducted
stores, and they entered into other kinds of businesses. They
proved themselves quite as shrewd as the men and well able
to look after their own affairs.

At least there was one woman of a scientific turn of mind.
"Jane Colden, the daughter of Governor Cadawallader Colden,
was of signal service, not in trade, but in science. A
letter written by her father explains her interest and usefulness:

'Botany is an amusement which may be made agreeable
to the ladies who are often at a loss to fill up their time.
Their natural curiosity and the pleasure they take in the
beauty and variety of dress seem to fit them for it.

'I have a daughter who has an inclination to reading, and
a curiosity for Natural Philosophy or Natural History, and
a sufficient curiosity for attaining a competent knowledge. I
took the pains to explain Linnæus' system, and to put it into
an English form for her use by freeing it from technical
terms, which was easily done, by using two or three words in
the place of one. She is now grown very fond of the study,
and has made such a progress in it as, I believe, would please
you, if you saw her performance. Though she could not have
been persuaded to learn the terms at first, she now understands
to some degree Linnæus' characters       notwithstanding
she does not understand Latin. She has already a pretty
large volume in writing of the description of plants. She[Pg 336]
has shewn a method of taking the impression of the leaves on
paper with printer's ink, by a simple kind of rolling press
which is of use in distinguishing the species. No description
in words alone, can give so clear an idea, as when assisted
with a picture. She has the impression of three hundred
plants in the manner you'll see by the samples. That you
may have some conception of her performance, and her manner
of describing, I propose to enclose some samples in her
own writing, some of which I think are new genera.'

"Peter Collinson said she was the first lady to study the
Linnæan system, and deserved to have her name celebrated;
and John Ellis, writing of her to Linnæus in 1758, asks that
a genus be named, for her, Coldenella. She was also a correspondent
of Dr. Whyte of Edinburgh, and many learned
societies in Europe. Walter Rutherfurd enumerates her
talents, and caps them with a glowing tribute to her cheese-making."234


Marriage. There never occurred in the colonies the very
early marriages of children, such as had been in vogue
in England some years before the colonies arose in America
but which had grown very much less in England at this time.
Yet they occurred early enough in the colonies, as there were
marriages at fifteen and sixteen and less, for being a new
country women were scarce and they were rarely allowed to
become very old before they were in demand as wives. A
young woman who passed twenty years of age without being
married was rare indeed and it could not be understood why
such should be the case.

Wooing in those days was done under much difficulties.
In Boston a young man had to be very particular to get the
consent of the young woman's parents or guardians before
he entered upon his wooing, and even then he had to proceed
cautiously or else fines, imprisonments, or the whipping-post
would be applied to him. Yet it was not always demurely
done in Old New England, as, in 1660 in New Haven, one
day, "they sat down together; his arm being about her; and
her arm upon his shoulder or about his neck; and hee kissed
her and shee kissed him, or they kissed one another, continuing
in this posture about half an hour, as Maria and Susan
testified."235 In New London in 1670 two lovers were accused
and tried for sitting together on the Lord's Day under an[Pg 337]
apple tree in an orchard. On account of the difficulties of
wooing, there came into use two most peculiar modes of
courting, known as "bundling" and the "courting-stick."

The courting-stick was six feet or so long, about an inch
in diameter, hollow, and with an enlargement at each end
for speaking into and for hearing from. A picture in
Harper's Weekly for November 29, 1900, no doubt historically
correct, represents the father seated in the fireplace, the
mother busy spinning, by the mother the daughter sitting on
the bench knitting, while the young man is sitting across the
room, with cider mug and pitcher beside him, and he is just
in the act of raising the courting-stick to his mouth, the other
end of which is lying in the lap of the young lady. To
complete the picture, a younger sister is crouched behind the
high back of the settee upon which her sister is sitting, ready
to overhear what the young man would send over through
the stick, so as to be prepared to tease her sister on the
morrow.

According to the only one who has given us a general history
of the subject "bundling was practiced in two forms;
first between strangers, as a simple domestic make-shift arrangement,
often arising from the necessities of a new country,
and by no means peculiar to America; and, secondly between
lovers, who shared the same couch, with the mutual
understanding that innocent endearment should not be exceeded."236
Webster's New International Dictionary gives
the following: "To bundle       To sleep or lie in the same bed
without undressing:       said of a man and woman, esp, lovers."
The Century Dictionary defines it thus: "To bundle       In New
England (in early times) and in Wales, to sleep in the same
bed without undressing; applied to the custom of men and
women, especially sweethearts, thus sleeping."

Writers upon the subject are at a loss to account for bundling
having been permitted among a people so austere as
were the early New Englanders; who highly esteemed virtue
and severely punished unchastity. Yet bundling was openly
practiced and perhaps "in its open recognition lay its redeeming
feature. There was no secrecy, no thought of concealment;
the bundling was done under the supervision of
mother and sisters."237 It is a question whether such a custom
showed coarseness and viciousness in the people or if it[Pg 338]
really showed a hospitality in that the guest was thus found
a place to rest for the night, nevertheless the smallness of the
dwelling or the crowded condition of the rooms. Again, the
severe New England climate would make it next to impossible
for the lover otherwise to have been made comfortable through
the night without a great outlay of fuel, and a corresponding
waste of lights, which would be carefully considered by the
frugal colonists. Yet this custom was not altogether confined
to the lower and poorer classes. In all probabilities this did
not originate with the colonists but was brought over from
the mother country, as it existed in Ireland, Scotland, and
Wales, and in a form in Holland.

Bundling, it would seem, did not exist among the colonists
outside of New England and Pennsylvania, while among the
Dutch in New York the somewhat similar form of "questing"
was known. It was not considered to any great extent wrong
until the young colonial soldiers returning to their homes
after the French and Indian wars took with them the vices
of the camp and thus brought this practice into disrepute.
Jonathan Edwards preached against it and other ministers
joined in and the custom finally died out. It was at the greatest
height among the colonists in the middle of the eighteenth
century, and yet it reached down into the nineteenth
century, being found in the region of Cape Cod as late as
1827, and in Pennsylvania even as late as 1845, such being
shown by a court record, "and where it probably still lingers
in out-of-the-way places among people both of English and
of German extraction."238

Wooing was not always so difficult as to need the courting-stick
or bundling to help it along, for some times it was
done in a hurry and in most any place. There were cases in
New England where a man would seek out a woman, call at
her home, tell her his need of a wife, get her consent, and
send in their desire for marriage to the town clerk to be published,
and all this accomplished in one day or even a few
hours. In the time of the Dutch in New York, one day a
widower saw a young lady milking and falling in love with
her told his love at once. Before she had finished milking,
he jumped on his horse and rode in a great hurry to town,
obtained his license, and hurriedly returned and took off his
bride.[Pg 339]

Love was not the only motive for marriage in New England,
for it was quite customary to make inquiries concerning
the bride's portion, and before marriage to arrange what
should go with her. Sometimes a father-in-law was sued by
his son-in-law for this portion.

There were, too, other ways of getting wives beside wooing
them, as is shown by the following advertisement, which appeared
in the Boston Evening Post for February 23, 1759:

"To the Ladies. Any young Lady between the Age of
Eighteen and twenty three of a Midling Stature; brown Hair,
regular Features and a Lively Brisk Eye; Of Good Morals
      not Tinctured with anything that may Sully so Distinguishable
a Form possessed of 3 or 400£ entirely her own Disposal
and where there will be no necessity of going Through the
tiresome Talk of addressing Parents or Guardians for their
Consent: Such a one by leaving a Line directed for A.      W.,
at the British Coffee House in King Street appointing where
an Interview may be had will meet with a Person who flatters
himself he shall not be thought Disagreeable by any
Lady answering the above description. N.      B. Profound
Secrecy will be observ'd. No Trifling Answers will be regarded."239

Among the New England colonists there was a formal
ceremony of betrothal, called a pre-contract or contraction.
There was made a solemn promise of marriage between the
couple before two witnesses and often there was a sermon
preached in the church upon it by the minister, wherein it
was the custom to permit the bride to select the text. The
wedding-bans in New England were published three times in
the meeting-house. This might be at any of the meetings       Sunday
service, lecture, or town meeting. The names of the
parties and their intention to marry were read by the minister,
the town clerk, or the deacon at any of the meetings
and on the church door or on a "publishing post" was placed
a notice containing this information. In New York, under
the English, this custom was considered not genteel and was
very little practiced, as there a marriage license was issued.
In Virginia both customs were in practice, as a license was
required and also the bans had to be published for three several
Sundays in the parish church where the contracting
parties dwelt.

In the early days of the colonists in New England, mar[Pg 340]riage
was considered a civil contract and the minister was
not permitted to perform the marriage ceremony, the law
requiring that all marriages should be conducted by a civil
magistrate. But even as it was, the marriage ceremony was
really of a religious nature as psalms were sung by the guests
and prayers offered. Gradually the prejudice against ecclesiastical
rites passed away and by the close of the seventeenth
century ministers were authorized by law to perform the
marriage ceremony. In the early times the wedding occurred
in the home and was quietly conducted, but after a time feasting
was added to the singing of psalms and the offering of
prayers. In Virginia the custom was just the opposite, for
civil marriage was not permitted by law, the ceremony having
to be of a religious character and according to the rites of
the Church of England. There was never a civil marriage
before a magistrate permitted by law till near the close of
the eighteenth century and then only allowed in very exceptional
cases.

Among the Puritan colonists in New England the rude
and really brutal wedding customs of the old country were
entirely suppressed or greatly modified. Sack-posset was
drunk at weddings and although this might have occurred
within the bridal chamber, yet a psalm was sung before partaking
and the drinking was followed with a prayer, which
made a rather solemn affair out of it. There must have been,
though, some weddings that were not so solemn, as in 1651
a law was passed that there should not be dancing at taverns
at the time of a wedding on account of abuses and disorders
that had occurred at such times. Among the Germans in
Pennsylvania at a wedding the guests strove to steal a shoe
off the bride's foot and the groomsmen tried to prevent this
and if they did not the shoe was redeemed with a bottle of
wine. In some parts the guests tried to obtain a garter of
the bride as it brought luck and a quick marriage to the one
getting it. In the Connecticut Valley the custom prevailed
of stealing the bride. This was done by a group of young
men, usually made up of those not invited to the wedding,
who would rush in at the close of the marriage ceremony and
seize the bride and carry her off to the tavern, where she was
redeemed by the groom and his friends with a supper to the
abductors. In some places it was the custom to tie wild
grape-vines across the path of a wedding-party or to fell[Pg 341]
trees across the road to delay them, while at other times they
would be greeted by a sudden volley fired from ambush.

"Isolated communities retained for many years marriage
customs derived or copied from similar customs in the 'old
country.' Thus the settlers of Londonderry, New Hampshire       Scotch-Irish
Presbyterians       celebrated a marriage
with much noisy firing of guns, just as their ancestors in
Ireland, when the Catholics had been forbidden the use of
firearms, had ostentatiously paraded their privileged Protestant
condition by firing off their guns and muskets at every
celebration. A Londonderry wedding made a big noise in
the world. After the formal publishing of the bans, guests
were invited with much punctiliousness. The wedding day
was suitably welcomed at daybreak by a discharge of musketry
at both the bride's and the groom's house. At a given
hour the bridegroom, accompanied by his male friends, started
for the bride's home. Salutes were fired at every house
passed on the road, and from each house pistols and guns
gave an answering 'God speed.' Half way on the journey
the noisy bridal party was met by the male friends of the
bride, and another discharge of firearms rent the air. Each
group of men then named a champion to 'run for the bottle!'       a
direct survival of the ancient wedding sport known among
the Scotch as 'running for the bride-door,' or 'riding for
the kail' or 'for the broose'       a pot of spiced broth. The
two New Hampshire champions ran at full speed or rode a
dare-devil race over dangerous roads to the bride's house, the
winner seized the beribboned bottle of rum provided for the
contest, returned to the advancing bridal group, drank the
bride's health, and passed the bottle. On reaching the bride's
house an extra salute was fired, and the bridegroom with his
party entered a room set aside for them. It was a matter of
strict etiquette that none of the bride's friends should enter
this room until the bride, led by the best man, advanced and
stationed herself with her bridesmaid before the minister,
while the best man stood behind the groom. When the time
arrived for the marrying pair to join hands, each put the
right hand behind the back, and the bridesmaid and the best
man pulled off the wedding-gloves, taking care to finish their
duty at precisely the same moment. At the end of the ceremony
everyone kissed the bride, and more noisy firing of guns
and drinking of New England rum ended the day."240[Pg 342]

One peculiar custom was that of the "coming out" of the
bride. On the Sunday after the wedding, the bride and
groom and, sometimes, also the other members of the bridal
party, would attend church in their wedding clothes. It was
a common and an expected thing for the bridal couple to
occupy some conspicuous place and in the midst of the sermon
stand and slowly turn about to show their clothing. The
peeking of the congregation can well be imagined when the
groom was dressed in a velvet coat, lace-frilled shirt, and
white broadcloth knee-breeches and the bride in a gorgeous
peach-colored silk gown and a bonnet with sixteen yards of
white ribbon on it. One groom was not content with showing
off on one Sunday when he came out in white broadcloth
for the next Sunday he was attired in brilliant blue and gold
and the third Sunday in peach-bloom with pearl buttons.

An engagement of marriage was a very important matter
and when once properly entered into it could not be lightly
broken. There are records of a good number of breach of
promise suits in New England and New York. Sometimes
the suit was brought by the woman or her father against the
man; sometimes, too, it was the man that brought the suit
against the woman. Although the father had great control
over his daughter in reference to her choice of a husband,
yet if he permitted a contract to be entered into with his
daughter he could not break off the engagement without good
reason, such as a court would accept. There are a number
of cases on record where the young man brought suit against
the girl's father for breach of contract, sometimes for loss of
time in paying court to the daughter. In some cases the
young man in his suit included both the father and the
mother and also the girl, claiming that all joined in against
him.

Since there was civil marriage in New England it would
seem naturally to follow that there would be civil divorce,
which was the case. Not only were church courts not established
in New England but also there were none in any of the
colonies. As in Virginia marriage was by the church and as
there were no church courts, there were no statutes on divorce
enacted in that colony. There were separations, though, and
the courts acted upon them when brought before them. The
causes allowed for divorce in New England were such as
desertion, cruelty, and breach of the marriage vow. Usually
the husband and wife were dealt with as equals before the[Pg 343]
law. "Female adultery was never doubted to have been
sufficient cause; but male adultery, after some debate and
consultation with the elders, was judged not sufficient."241
This has reference to Massachusetts, being from Governor
Hutchinson.

The bearing of husband and wife was rather carefully
regulated by law in New England. A husband could not
keep his wife on frontiers where there was much danger, nor
could he leave her for any long while, nor could he whip her,
and he was not even allowed to use harsh words with her. A
wife must not scold her husband too much nor strike him,
lest she be put in the public stocks or pillory. Nor could
they be too publicly demonstrative. "Captain Kemble of
Boston sat two hours in the public stocks (1656) for his 'lewd
and unseemly behavior' in kissing his wife 'publicquely' on
the Sabbath upon his doorstep when he had just returned
from a voyage of three years."242 In old New York it was
the custom to strive to reconcile all difficulties and even in
some cases it seems that force was almost, if not quite used to
have the husband and wife live together. In no case was the
father of the wife to permit his daughter to have refuge in
his home against the wishes of her husband.

"In spite of the hardness and narrowness of their daily
life, and the cold calculation, the lack of sentiment displayed
in wooing, I think Puritan husbands and wives were happy
in their marriages, though their love was shy, almost somber,
and 'flowered out of sight like the fern.' A few love-letters
still remain to prove their affection: letters of sweethearts
and letters of married lovers, such as Governor Winthrop and
his wife Margaret:

"'My own dear Husband: How dearly welcome thy kind
letter was to me, I am not able to express. The sweetness of
it did much refresh me. What can be more pleasing to a
wife than to hear of the welfare of her best beloved and how
he is pleased with her poor endeavors! I blush to hear myself
commended, knowing my own wants. But it is your love that
conceives the best and makes all things seem better than they
are. I wish that I may always be pleasing to thee, and that
these comforts we may have in each other may be daily increased
so far as they be pleasing to God. I will use that
speech to thee that Abigail did to David, I will be a servant[Pg 344]
to wash the feet of my lord; I will do any service wherein I
may please my good husband. I confess I cannot do enough
for thee; but thou art pleased to accept the will for the deed
and rest contented. I have many reasons to make me love
thee, whereof I shall name two: First, because thou lovest
God, and secondly, because thou lovest me. If these two
were wanting all the rest would be eclipsed. But I must
leave this discourse and go about my household affairs. I
am a bad housewife to be so long from them; but I must
needs borrow a little time to talk with thee, my sweetheart.
It will be but two or three weeks before I see thee, though
they be long ones. God will bring us together in good time,
for which time I shall pray. And thus with my mother's and
my own best love to yourself I shall leave scribbling. Farewell
my good husband, the Lord keep thee.

'Your obedient wife,
'Margaret Winthrop.'"243

In the good old colonial days of New England it was not
only a man's duty to marry but also a necessity, so a widower
did not remain single as a usual thing nor was it usual to
remain in that condition very long, as for instance, "the
father and mother of Governor Winslow had been widow and
widower seven and twelve weeks respectively, when they
joined their families and themselves in mutual benefit, if not
in mutual love. At a later day, the impatient Governor of
New Hampshire married a lady but ten days a widow."244
"Peter Sargent, a rich Boston merchant, had three wives.
His second had had two previous husbands. His third wife
had lost one husband, and she survived Peter, and also her
third husband, who had three wives. His father had four,
the last three of whom were widows."245

One poor widower had quite a time after his wife's death
as depicted in his diary, and to the cares and troubles of
this poor old man, Judge Sewall of Boston, Mrs. Earle devotes
thirteen pages of her Customs and Fashions in Old New
England, and they are truly most unlucky pages. The Judge
lost his wife on October 19, 1717, with whom he had lived
forty-three years and they had seven sons and seven daughters,
and on February 6th, of the following year (he was 66[Pg 345]
at the time) is found in his Diary: "'Wandering in my
mind whether to live a Married or a Single life.' Ere that
date he had begun to take notice. He had called more than
once on Widow Ruggles, and had had Widow Gill to dine
with him; and looked critically at Widow Emery, and noted
that Widow Tilley was absent from meeting; and he had
gazed admiringly at Widow Winthrop in 'her sley.'"246
Nor were the good old Dutch of New York far behind their
Yankee neighbors in this matter, although they didn't want
to allow their wives the same privileges without encumbrances,
as, "John Burroughs, of Newtown, Long Island, in
his will dated 1678 expressed the general feeling of husbands
towards their prospective widows when he said: 'If my wife
marry again, then her husband must provide for her as I
have.'"247 In 1673 a husband in making a joint-will with his
wife enjoined loss of property if his wife married again.
"Perhaps he thought there had been enough marrying and
giving in marriage already in that family, for Brieta had
had three husbands       a Dane, a Frieslander, and a German       and
his first wife had had four, and he       well, several, I guess;
and you couldn't expect any poor Dutchman to find it easy
to make a will in all that confusion."248

"The precocity of colonial marriage allowed time for repetitions
of the act. Many of the Virginia girls that married in
childhood and assumed the burdens of family at so immature
an age became broken in health and after bearing a dozen
children died, leaving their husbands to marry again and
beget new broods perhaps as large as the first. On the eastern
shore of Virginia in the seventeenth century it was not
remarkable for a man to have three or four successive
wives. There were instances of Virginians married six times.
It is not unusual to find a colonial dame that was married
four times. Few conspicuous colonial men in Virginia, at
least, lived beyond middle life; most died short of it. The
malarial climate, exposure, and reckless habits cut them off.
The young and attractive widows need not remain long forlorn
in a country with a preponderance of males, at least if
the feminine charms were supplemented by a fine plantation.
Sometimes the relay was so close that the second husband was
granted the probate of the will of the first. In one case[Pg 346]
funeral baked meats furnished the marriage table. One husband
left all the estate to his wife's children by her next marriage.
Quickness of remarriage does not indicate callousness
but rather the woman's need of protection on the plantation
and of an overseer for the work.

"A noticeable feature of colonial Virginia was the belleship
of widows. Maidens seem not to have been 'in it.' As we
come toward the Revolution the widows still reign supreme.
It may be that the larger social experience of the widows
magnified their charms or made them more adept at handling
bashful lovers. Washington belonged in this class if we may
trust the sentimental poems that he wrote to the unknown
maiden that he loved when he was fifteen. After several unsuccessful
affairs he probably was sufficiently experienced
not to dally in his wooing of Mrs. Custis. Patrick Henry's
father married a widow; so did Jefferson and James Madison."249

In New Netherlands there prevailed a custom, borrowed
from Holland, that when a man died and left a number of
debts the widow could be relieved from all demands or claims
of his creditors by giving up her rights of inheritance. In
one form this giving up of rights was shown by the widow's
laying a key and a purse on the coffin of the deceased husband.
There was another peculiar custom in both New England
and New York for the purpose of getting out of paying
debts. In this the widow was married in her shift, often at
cross-roads, and sometimes at midnight. Later the custom
was for the widow to be in a closet with no clothing on and
put out her hand through a hole in the door for the marriage
ceremony. Under such a marriage it was held that the new
husband was exempt from paying the debts of the former
husband and even of those of the wife contracted before her
marriage to the new husband. After her marriage, whether
on road or in closet, the new bride would deck herself out in
clothing furnished by the new husband, usually these were
with her in the closet, and then she would come forth resplendent
and unencumbered to her new man.

As in all new countries, in the early times of the United
States, women were fewer than men and very few women
remained unmarried. Too, it was quite necessary for a
woman to marry as she needed some one to care for her and[Pg 347]
protect her more than would be the case in an old and well-settled
country. Yet there were some few women who preferred
maidenhood to marriage, but for the most part such
women had a hard time, for they were not well considered by
the colonists as they believed it to be the duty for every man
and woman to marry. At least one such woman persevered
in this state for quite a time as there is a record of her death
in her 91st year.

"The state of old maidism was reached at a very early age
in those early days; Higginson wrote of an 'antient maid' of
twenty-five years. John Dunton in his 'Life and Errors'
wrote eulogistically of one such ideal 'Virgin' who attracted
his special attention.

"'It is true an old (or superannuated) Maid in Boston is
thought such a curse, as nothing can exceed it (and looked on
as a dismal spectacle) yet she by her good nature, gravity,
and strict virtue convinces all (so much as the fleering
Beaus) that it is not her necessity but her choice that keeps
her a Virgin. She is now about thirty years (the age which
they call a Thornback) yet she never disguises herself, and
talks as little as she thinks, of Love. She never reads any
Plays or Romances, goes to no Balls or Dancing-match (as
they do who go to such Fairs), to meet with Chapmen. Her
looks, her speech, her whole behavior are so very chaste, that
but once (at Governor's Island, where we went to be merry
at roasting a hog) going to kiss her, I thought she would have
blushed to death.

"'Our Damsel knowing this, her conversation is generally
amongst the women (as there is least danger from that sex),
so that I found it no easy matter to enjoy her company, for
most of her time (save what was taken up in needle work
and learning French,      c.) was spent in Religious Worship.
She knew time was a dressing-room for Eternity, and therefore
reserves most of her hours for better uses than those of
the Comb, the Toilet and the Glass.

"'And as I am sure this is most agreeable to the Virgin
modesty, which should make Marriage an act rather of their
obedience than their choice. And they that think their
Friends too slowpaced in the matter give certain proof that
lust is their sole motive. But as the Damsel I have been
describing would neither anticipate nor contradict the will
of her Parents, so do I assure you she is against Forcing her[Pg 348]
own, by marrying where she cannot love; and that is the
reason she is still a Virgin.'"250

Even if the Puritan did tolerate the unmarried woman he
scarcely did the unmarried man, for it was considered almost
a crime for a man to remain single. They went so far that
to encourage bachelors to marry they were given home lots
upon which to build if they married. Whatever the cause,
there were very few bachelors among them. Bachelors were
treated almost as criminals as they were spied upon by the
constable, the watchman, and the tithing-man. In some places
they had to pay a stipulated sum per week, or other time, for
the privilege of remaining single, while in other places they
were not permitted to live alone. An order issued in 1695
in Eastham, Mass., reads: "Every unmarried man in the
township shall kill six blackbirds or three crows while he remains
single; as a penalty for not doing it, shall not be married
until he obey this order."251 "Bachelors were not in
good standing among the Dutch, at least in Albany. The
colony had no laws, as in New England, to regulate these
misfits and they shared in the benefit of Dutch tolerance toward
misguided folk. But where marriage was so spontaneous,
bachelors were almost pariahs. They did manage to
find shelter but not home. Mrs. Grant describes them as
passing in and out like silent ghosts and seeming to feel themselves
superior to the world. Their association was almost
exclusively with one another though sometimes one took part
in the affairs of the family with which he lived."252


Dress. In the very early days there was quite a difference
of feeling in reference to dress among the various colonies.
In Virginia there was no horror of fine clothing and they
dressed as far as they could as in the home country. In New
England and Pennsylvania this was different, as in the former
the Puritans were much against fine dress and in the
latter the Quakers dressed demurely. In New York saving
was such a grace with the Dutch that the clothing was quite
durable, whatever the style. Yet even among the early colonists
there was a disposition to dress according to rank and
hence finery was not altogether excluded from any of the
colonies. This is shown in the laws, as, in Virginia in 1623
only those of the governor's council were allowed to wear[Pg 349]
silk, and, in 1651 the General Court of Massachusetts set
forth its "utter detestation and dislike that men or women of
meane condition, educations and callinges should take uppon
them the garbe of gentlemen, by the wearinge of gold or silver
lace, or buttons, or poynts at theire knees, to walke in greate
boots, or women of the same ranke to weare silke or tiffany
hoodes or scarfes."253

As the colonies grew and wealth increased, display in dress
grew and continued up through the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries. There was a constant succession of rich
and gay fashions patterned after those of Europe. This was
not only true of women's clothing but of men's as well. There
were importations from Europe, among which were gauzes,
silks, laces, velvets, and fine cloths of bright colors. Too,
when trade widened, goods were brought from China and the
East Indies. Although the colonists might wear rich clothing
they were not wasteful, for the gowns and ribbons were
turned and dyed and well cared for, and much of the clothing
was passed on to other generations. This passion for
dress was not even stopped by the Revolutionary War as is
shown from a letter by a Hessian officer of that time:

"They are great admirers of cleanliness and keep themselves
well shod. They friz their hair every day and gather
it up on the back of the head into a chignon at the same
time puffing it up in front. They generally walk about with
their heads uncovered and sometimes but not often wear some
light fabric on their hair. Now and then some country
nymph has her hair flowing down behind her, braiding it
with a piece of ribbon. Should they go out even though they
be living in a hut, they throw a silk wrap about themselves,
and put on gloves. They also put on some well made and
stylish little sunbonnet, from beneath which their roguish
eyes have a most fascinating way of meeting yours. In the
English colonies the beauties have fallen in love with red
silk or woolen wraps. The wives and daughters spend more
than their incomes allow. The man must fish up the last
penny he has in his pocket. The funniest part of it is the
women do not seem to steal it from them, neither do they
obtain it by cajoling, fighting, or falling in a faint. How
they obtain it is a mystery, but that the men are heavily
taxed for their extravagance is certain. The daughters keep
up their stylish dressing because their mothers desire it.[Pg 350]
Nearly all articles necessary for the adornment of the female
sex are very scarce and dear. For this reason they are wearing
their Sunday finery. Should this begin to show signs of
wear I am afraid that the husbands and fathers will be compelled
to make peace with the Crown if they would keep their
women folk supplied with gewgaws."254

This growth in the richness of apparel did not escape the
eyes of the lawmakers, for sumptuary laws were passed in
order to restrain and even prohibit luxury and extravagance
in dress, but needless to say all such laws failed in the end.
In 1634 the General Court of Massachusetts gave out the
order:

"That no person either man or woman shall hereafter
make or buy any apparel, either woolen or silk or linen with
any lace on it, silver, gold, or thread, under the penalty of
forfeiture of said clothes. Also that no person either man or
woman shall make or buy any slashed clothes other than one
slash in each sleeve and another in the back; also all cut-works,
embroideries, or needlework cap, bands, and rails are
forbidden hereafter to be made and worn under the aforesaid
penalty; also all gold or silver girdles, hatbands, belts, ruffs,
beaverhats are prohibited to be bought and worn hereafter."255

"In 1639 'immoderate great breeches, knots of ryban,
broad shoulder bands and rayles, silk ruses, double ruffles
and capes' were added to the list of tabooed garments."256 In
1651 came the utterance of the Court as given before.

Nor were these idle laws, for many people were tried and
punished. In Northampton in 1676 there were thirty-eight
women brought up at one time before the court for their
"wicked apparell." Not only did the courts and lawmakers
try to stop the increase for showy clothing but also the ministers
took up the refrain and preached against the display
of finery.

"After a while the whole church interfered. In 1679 the
church at Andover put it to vote whether 'the parish Disapprove
of the female sex sitting with their Hats on in the
Meeting-house in time of Divine Service as being Indecent.'
In the town of Abington, in 1775, it was voted that it was
'an indecent way that the female sex do sit with their hats[Pg 351]
and bonnets on to worship God.' Still another town voted it
was the 'Town's Mind' that the women should take their
bonnets off in meeting and hang them 'on the peggs.' We
do not know positively, but I suspect that the bonnets continued
to grace the heads instead of the pegs in Andover,
Abington, and other towns."257

In the early times in New England the men wore breeches
of leather or of heavy woolens lined with leather with waistcoats,
jackets, and doublets of leather, being plain and durable.
But even at that early time there were scarlet caps and
scarlet coats. In the country the clothing of the men was
usually plain and made by the people themselves, the cloth
being spun, dyed, and woven at home. Sometimes trousers
were worn instead of the conventional short-clothes and shoes
and hose dispensed with, the men going barefooted. Among
the frontiersmen there were suits of deer-skin and coats
made of bear-skin and raccoon-skin.

"The frontiersmen and hunters did not quite escape the
prevailing fondness for the decorative and fanciful in dress.
That some of them clubbed and some of them queued their
hair, I have already remarked. Their 'hunting-shirt,' which
served for vest and coat also, was of linsey-wolsey or buckskin
in winter and of tow-linen in the summer. It had many
fringes and a broad belt about the middle. The hunter wore
either breeches of buckskin or thin trousers; over these he
fastened coarse woolen leggins tied with garters or laced well
up the thigh, as a defense against mud, serpents, insects, and
thorns. He wore moccasins, and covered his head with a
flapped hat of a reddish hue, or a cap. The sharp tomahawk
stuck in his belt served for a weapon, for hatchet, for hammer,
and for a whole kit of tools besides. The shot-bag and
powder-horn completed his outfit; the powder-horn was his
darling, and upon it he lavished all the resources of his ingenuity,
carving it with whimsical devices of many sorts.
And there was probably less that was in false taste in the
woodman's outfit than in any costume of the period."258

Whatever way the New England Puritan may have dressed
himself in the early colonial times, he did not hesitate to
bedeck himself in the later times. "Picture to yourself the
garb in which the patriot John Hancock appeared one noon-day
in 1782:[Pg 352]

"'He wore a red velvet cap within which was one of fine
linen, the last turned up two or three inches over the lower
edge of the velvet. He also wore a blue damask gown lined
with velvet, a white stock, a white satin embroidered waistcoat,
black satin small-clothes, white silk stockings and red
morocco slippers.'

"What gay peacock was this strutting all point-device in
scarlet slippers and satin and damask, spreading his gaudy
feathers at high noon in sober Boston Streets!       was this our
boasted Republican simplicity? And what 'fop-tackle' did
the dignified Judge of the Supreme Court wear in Boston
at that date? He walked home from the bench in the winter
time clad in a magnificent white corduroy surtout lined with
fur, with his judicial hands thrust in a great fur muff.

"Fancy a Boston publisher going about his business tricked
up in this dandified dress       a true New England jessamy.

"'He wore a pea-green coat, white vest, nankeen small-clothes,
white silk stockings and pumps fastened with silver
buckles which covered at least half the foot from instep to
toe. His small-clothes were tied at the knees with riband of
the same color in double bows, the ends reaching down to the
ancles. His hair in front was well loaded with pomatum,
frizzled or creped, and powdered; the ear locks had undergone
the same process. Behind his natural hair was augmented
by the addition of a large queue, called vulgarly the
false tail, which, enrolled in some yards of black riband,
hung halfway down his back.'"259

The dress of the women among the colonists is shown in
such lists as in the will of Jane Humphrey, who died in
Dorchester, Mass., in 1668:

"Ye Jump. Best Red Kersey Petticoate, Sad Grey Kersey
Wascote. My blemmish Searge Petticoate       my best

next best Neck Cloath. A square Cloath with a little lace on

"Vrouentje Ides Stoffelsen, the wife of a respectable and
well-to-do Dutch settler in New Netherlands, left behind her
in 1641 a gold hoop ring, a silver medal and chain and a
silver under-girdle to hang keys on; a damask furred jacket,
two black camlet jackets, two doublets       one iron gray, the
other black; a blue, a steel-gray lined petticoat, and a black
coarse camlet-lined petticoat; two black skirts, a new bodice,
two white waistcoats, one of Harlem stuff; a little black vest
with two sleeves, a pair of damask sleeves, a reddish morning
gown, not lined; four pairs pattens, one of Spanish leather;
a purple apron and four blue aprons; nineteen cambric caps
and four linen ones; a fur cap trimmed with beaver; nine
linen handkerchiefs trimmed with lace, two pair of old
stockings, and three shifts."261

The list of the wardrobe of the widow of Dr. Jacob De
Lange, of New York, in 1682, showed the following:

"One under petticoat with a body of red bay; one under
petticoat, scarlet; one petticoat, red cloth with black lace;
one striped stuff petticoat with black lace; two colored drugget
petticoats with gray linings; two colored drugget petticoats
with white linings; one colored drugget petticoat with
pointed lace; one black silk petticoat with ash gray silk
lining; one potto-foo silk petticoat with black silk lining; one
potto-foo silk petticoat with taffeta lining; one silk potoso-à-samare
with lace; one tartanel samare with tucker; one
black silk crape samare with tucker; three flowered calico
samares; three calico nightgowns, one flowered, two red; one
silk waistcoat, one calico waistcoat; one pair of bodice; five
pair white cotton stockings; three black love-hoods; one white
love-hood; two pair sleeves with great lace; four cornet caps
with lace; one black silk rain cloth cap; one black plush mask;
four yellow lace drowlas; one embroidered purse with silver
bugle and chain to the girdle and silver hook and eye; one
pair black pendants, gold nocks; one gold boat, wherein thirteen
diamonds       one white coral chain; one pair gold stucks[Pg 354]
or pendants each with ten diamonds; two diamond rings; one
gold ring with clasp back; one gold ring or hoop bound round
with diamonds."262

There was no ready-made clothing in the colonies till late,
for men appearing about the middle of the eighteenth century
and for women not till near the close of the same century.
The women's clothing was made by themselves or by
dressmakers, who had establishments in the town and went
from home to home in the country. Sometimes the women
would send to the home country for garments, which would be
passed about among themselves as models. A rather striking
way of introducing the new styles was by importing dolls
fully and carefully dressed in Europe in the newest fashions.
The notice of the arrival of such a doll is found in an advertisement
in the New England Weekly Journal of July 2, 1733.

"To be seen at Mrs. Hannah Teatts Mantua Maker at the
Head of Summer Street Boston a Baby drest after the Newest
Fashion of Mantues and Night Gowns       everything belonging
to a dress. Latilly arrived on Capt. White from London, any
Ladies that desire to see it may either come or send, she will
be ready to wait on 'em, if they come to the House it is Five
Shilling       if she waits on 'em it is Seven Shilling."263

They did not have a great deal of jewelry. Bracelets and
lockets were worn by a few of the women and some of the
men had gold and silver sleeve-buttons, and also men sometimes
wore thumb-rings, which seems in keeping with their
using muffs. Rings were common, which were for the most
part mourning-rings, as these were given to all the chief
mourners at funerals. Silver buckles for the knees and ankles
were quite common among the men. Paste brilliants were
very much in use, being worn on shoe buckles by the men,
and women wore paste combs and paste pins. Watches appeared
in England about the middle of the seventeenth century,
but it was quite a little later before they were found
among the colonists, and even then they were used only by
the wealthy. Umbrellas, made of oiled linen, came into use
late in the colonial period, but before that the ladies had
learned to protect their faces from the sun by sun-fans of
green paper, and green masks were worn while riding. In
New England black velvet masks were used as a shield from
the cold, being held in place by means of a silver mouthpiece.[Pg 355]
Hoopskirts came into fashion and they became quite
big affairs about the middle of the eighteenth century. To
set off the coats and breeches of gaudy colors the men wore
shirts with highly ruffled bosoms. The stylish shoes of the
women were frail affairs, being of very thin material and
with paper soles which were protected by overshoes known
as goloe-shoes, clogs, pattens, etc.

In the colonies the customs in reference to the wearing of
the hair prevailed as in use in the old country, the Puritans
in New England keeping their hair short, as did their
brethren in England, and so nicknamed Roundheads, while
in Virginia the hair was worn long, as was the custom with
the Cavaliers of England. As hard as the New Englanders
fought against long hair, going as far as to offer men under
sentence release from punishment if they would cut off their
long hair, the Virginians went further and made short hair
disgraceful by making it a brand and a mark of identification
for indentured servants when caught and returned to their
masters after running away before their time of service had
expired.

But Puritan and Cavalier and Quaker all succumbed to
the wig. The rage for wearing wigs by the beginning of
the eighteenth century seemed to have possessed the colonists,
as wigs were worn by men of all ranks and conditions, by
children, servants, prisoners, and even sailors and soldiers.
The styles varied greatly, sometimes they swelled out at the
side, sometimes they hung in braids or in curls or in pig-tails,
and again they were in great puffs or were turned under
in heavy rolls. They were made of human hair, horsehair,
goat's-hair, calves' and cows' tails, thread, silk, and mohair.
Some of them were quite costly, even as much as the equal
of a hundred dollars today. There were a great variety of
styles of wigs, known as the tie, the brigadier, the spencer,
the major, the albemarle, the ramillies, the grave full-bottom,
the giddy feather-top, the campaign, the neck-lock, the bob,
the lavant, the vallaney, the drop-wig, the buckle-wig, the
bag-wig, the Grecian fly, the peruke, the beau-peruke, the
long-tail, the bob-tail, the fox-tail, the cut-wig, the tuck-wig,
the twist-wig, the scratch.264

"Soon after 1750, perhaps, the decline of the wig set in;
but the exuberant fancy of the age still made the heads of
gentlemen to blossom. The wig-maker's tortures fell upon[Pg 356]
the natural hair: it was curled, frizzled, and powdered; it
was queued or clubbed. The man of dignity, even the fashionable
clergyman, sat long beneath the hands of the barber
every day of his life. Side-locks and dainty little toupees
were cultivated. The 'maccaroni'       type and pink of the
most debauched English dandyism       made his appearance in
1774 in the fashionable assemblies of Charleston, and even in
Charleston there were two varieties of these creatures: the
one wore the hair clubbed, the other preferred the dangling
queue. The rage for growing the longest possible switch of
hair infected the lower classes; sailors and boatmen wrapped
in eel-skin their cherished locks, and the back-countryman in
some places was accustomed to preserve his from injury by
enveloping it in a piece of bear's-gut dyed red, or clubbing
it in a buckskin bag."265

The women of the colonies, like the men, tried to keep up
with the fashions of Europe. The manner in which they wore
their hair brought upon them the wrath of the parsons, one
of whom, Increase Mather, even included a notice of such
in his great sermon upon the comet in 1683: "Will not the
haughty daughters of Zion refrain their pride in apparell?
Will they lay out their hair, and wear false locks, their
borders, and towers like comets about their heads?"266 These
towers grew out of style, but they came back again near a
century later, in Revolutionary times. At this later time the
front hair was drawn up over a roll or cushion and stiffened
with powder and grease and then the back hair was drawn
up in a similar way. The pile was then built up with ribbons,
pompons, aigrettes, jewels, gauze, flowers, and feathers
till it arose near a half yard in height. This process took a
long time, as is told in 1771 by a bright little Boston school
girl, eleven years of age, who saw a hairdresser at his work.
"How long she was at his opperation, I know not. I saw
him twist       tug       pick       cut off whole locks of grey hair at a
slice (the lady telling him she would have no hair to dress
next time) for the space of a hour       a half, when I left
them, he seeming not to be near done."267 "One may judge
of the vital necessity there was for all this art from the fact
that a certain lady in Annapolis about the close of the
colonial period was accustomed to pay six hundred dollars[Pg 357]
a year for the dressing of her hair. On great occasions the
hairdresser's time was so fully occupied that some ladies
were obliged to have their mountainous coiffures built up two
days beforehand, and to sleep sitting in their chairs, or, according
to a Philadelphia tradition, with their heads inclosed
in a box."268

The contents of such a tower is shown in a description of
an accident to a young woman in the streets of Boston, as
found in the Boston Gazette of 1771. "In an infaust moment
she was thrown down by a runaway, and her tower
received serious damage. It burst its thin outer wall of
natural hair, and disgorged cotton and wool and tow stuffing,
false hair, loops of ribbon and gauze. Ill-bred boys kicked
off portions of the various excresences, and the tower-wearer
was jeered at until she was glad to escape with her own few
natural locks."269

These dressings of the hair called for material to use and
they had powdering puffs and powdering bags and powdering
machines and several varieties of powder to use in them,
such as brown, maréchal, scented, plain, and blue. Pomatums
came into use, one of which in a book dated 1706 is shown
to be made thus: "The Dutch way to make Orange-butter.
Take new cream two gallons, beat it up to a thicknesse, then
add half a pint of orange-flower-water, and as much red
wine, and so being become the thicknesse of butter it has
both the colour and smell of an orange."270 There were hair-restorers
and hair-dyes, all promising much to those using
them correctly and carefully, one such formula coming down
to us from 1685: "A Metson to make a mans heare groe when
he is bald. Take sume fier flies       sum Redd wormes       black
snayls and sum hume bees and dri them and pound them      
mixt them in milk or water."271

In early colonial times not much attention was given to
the teeth. The following is in line with their knowledge and
care of the teeth. "If you will keep your teeth from rot,
plug, or aking, wash the mouth continually with Juyce of
Lemons, and afterwards rub your teeth with a Sage Leaf
and Wash your teeth after meat with faire water. To cure
Tooth Ach. 1. Take Mastick and chew it in your mouth until[Pg 358]
it is as soft as wax, then stop your teeth with it, if hollow,
there remaining till it's consumed, and it will certainly cure
you. 2. The tooth of a dead man carried about a man presently
suppresses the pains of the Teeth."272 The tooth powders
were such as to be quite injurious to the teeth. One
such had in its combination cuttle-bone, brick-dust, and
pumice-stone. Another was to contain coral reduced to a
powder, and if no coral was to be had, then coarse earthenware
might be broken up and powdered for use. Their instruments
for pulling teeth were crude and caused the greatest
of pain, often breaking the jaw. The artificial teeth of
that time may have helped the looks, but they were of very
little value in eating, if any at all. There was used an ingrafting
process wherein sound teeth were extracted from one
person and inserted in another person's mouth. "I cannot
find any notice of the sale of 'teeth brushes' till nearly
Revolutionary times. Perhaps the colonists used, as in old
England, little brushes made of 'dentissick root' or mallow,
chewed into a fibrous swab."273

After the first years of hardships, and wealth began to
come to the colonists, there not only arose among the women
the desire for fine dress, but also a love of cosmetics. As
early as 1686 it was said of a woman of Boston, "to hide
her age she paints, and to hide her painting dares hardly
laugh." One of the ministers of New England about that
same time stated to his congregation: "At the resurrection
of the Just there will no such sight be met as the Angels
carrying Painted Ladies in their arms." In the newspapers
are advertisements of washes for the skin, face powders, face
paints, compositions to take off "Superficious Hair," face
patches, and the like. One of the leading cosmetics was the
wash-ball, a substitute for soap. They loved perfumes and
not only used them about their persons, but also to scent
their linen chests, closets, and rooms.

"With regard to the bathing habits of our ancestors but
little can be said, and but little had best be said. Charles
Francis Adams writes, with witty plainness, 'If among personal
virtues cleanliness be indeed that which ranks next to
godliness, then judged by the nineteenth century standards,
it is well if those who lived in the eighteenth century had a[Pg 359]
sufficiency of the latter quality to make good what they lacked
of the former.' He says there was not a bathroom in the
town of Quincy prior to the year 1820. And of what use
would pitchers or tubs of water have been in bedrooms
in the winter time, when, if exposed over night, solid ice
would be found therein in the morning? The washing of
linen in New England homes was done monthly; it is to be
hoped the personal baths were more frequent, even under
the apparent difficulties of accomplishment. I must state,
in truth, though with deep mortification, that I cannot find
in inventories even of Revolutionary times the slightest sign
of the presence of balneary appurtenances in bedrooms; not
even of ewers, lavers, and basins, nor of pails and tubs. As
petty pieces of furniture, such as stools, besoms, framed
pictures, and looking-glasses are enumerated, this conspicuous
absence of what we deem an absolute necessity for decency
speaks with a persistent and exceedingly disagreeable
voice of the unwashed condition of our ancestors, a condition
all the more mortifying when we consider their exceeding
external elegance in dress. This total absence of toilet appliances
does not, of course, render impossible a special lavatory
or bathroom in the house, or the daily importation to
the bedrooms of hot-water cans, twiggen bottles, bathtubs,
and basins from other portions of the house; but even that
equipment would show a lack of adequate bathing facilities.
Nor do the tiny toilet jugs and basins of Staffordshire ware
that date from the first part of this century point to any very
elaborate ablutions."274


Infants' Clothing. Some articles of clothing of infants of
colonial times have been preserved. These are not the common
every-day dress, as they were worn out or not thought
nice enough to lay away, but these remaining are the finer
sort such as their christening robes and their finer shirts,
caps, and petticoats, such as would not be worn very much
and kept put away till baby outgrew them and they were so
pretty that they were still preserved and have come down to
us to show us what beautiful apparel our baby forefathers
wore.

All the under-garments of the colonial baby were made of
linen       little low-necked shirts with short sleeves, made of
thin, fine linen. The little hands were enclosed in linen[Pg 360]
mitts, one pair, though, that comes down to us were made
of fine lace and there were some of silk, and some even of
stiff yellow nankeen. The baby-dresses are little, straight-laced
gowns for display, or, rather shapeless large-necked
sacks and drawn into shape at the neck with narrow cotton
ferret or linen bobbin. The poor little head was covered
summer and winter with a cap, which must have been quite
warm in summer as they were often warmly padded. Mrs.
Earle states that she had never seen a woolen petticoat which
was worn by an infant of pre-Revolutionary days. But there
were infants' cloaks of wool. There were also beautifully
embroidered long cloaks of chamois skin. The baby was kept
warm by little shawls placed around the shoulders and the
body was enveloped in quilts and shawls, which also included
the head and shoulders.


Boys' Clothing. In the early colonial times as soon as the
boys became old enough to get about, they were dressed like
their fathers. In Massachusetts the boys' clothing consisted of
doublets, which were warm double jackets, leather knee-breeches,
leather belts, knit caps, while in Virginia, because
of the warmer climate, their clothing was of lighter material.
Sometimes the boys had deerskin breeches.

When cotton goods became to be imported from Oriental
countries, about the latter part of the eighteenth century, the
clothing of children, as well as of grown-folks, were made
of it. This became so important in dress that it was worn in
winter as well as in summer. We find that boys wore nankeen
suits the entire year and that jackets and trousers for the
boys were made of calico and chintz. It is hard for us to believe
that boys in New England ever wore nankeen suits in
winter and even calico pants in snow time.

"There is an excellent list of the clothing of a New York
schoolboy of eleven years given in a letter written by Fitz-John
Winthrop to Robert Livingstone in 1690. This young
lad, John Livingstone, had also been in school in New England.
The 'account of linen       clothes' shows him to have been
well dressed. It reads thus:


"Eleven new shirts.
4 pr laced sleves.
8 plane cravets.
4 cravets with lace
4 stripte wastecoats with black buttons.
1 flowered wastecoat.
3 pr silver buttons.
2 pr fine blew stockings.
1 pr fine red stockings.
4 white handkerchiefs.
2 speckled handkerchiefs.
3 pair gloves.
1 stuff coat with black buttons.[Pg 361]
4 new osinbrig britches.
1 gray hat with a black ribbon
1 gray hat with a blew ribbon.
1 dousin black buttons.
1 dousin coloured buttons.
3 pr gold buttons.
1 cloth coat.
1 pr blew plush britches.
1 pr serge britches.
2 combs.
1 pr new shoes.
Silk       thred to mend his clothes."275


In 1759 George Washington ordered from England for his
step-son       Master Custis       six years of age, the following:


6 Pocket Handkerchiefs, small and fine.
6 pairs Gloves.
2 Laced Hats.
2 Pieces India Nankeen.
6 pairs fine Thread Stockings.
4             "             Coarse                       "                              "            
6             "             Worsted                "                              "            
4             "             Strong Shoes.
4             "             Pumps.
1 Summer suit of clothes to be made of something light and thin.
1 piece black Hair Ribbon.
1 pair handsome Silver Shoe       Knee Buckles.
1 light duffel Cloak with Silver Frogs.276



Girls' Clothing. The little girl of the early settlers must
have been dressed very plainly, as was her mother. As the
colonists grew wealthy and cities arose, the little girl's dress
grew to be quite elegant and stiff and formal and hampering,
nearly as much so as that of her mother.

In 1759, in the same list mentioned above for his step-son,
George Washington ordered from England for his step-daughter       Miss
Custis       four years of age, as follows:


8 pairs kid mitts.
4              "             gloves.
2              "             silk shoes.
4              "             Calamanco shoes.
4              "             leather pumps.
6              "             fine thread stockings.
4              "                         "             worsted              "            
2 Caps.
2 pairs Ruffles.
2 tuckers, bibs, and aprons if Fashionable.
2 Fans.
2 Masks.
2 bonnets.[Pg 362]
1 Cloth Cloak.
1 Stiffened Coat of Fashionable silk made to packthread stays.
6 yards Ribbon.
2 Necklaces.
1 pair Silver Sleeve Buttons with Stones.
6 Pocket Handkerchiefs.277


"A little girl four years of age, in kid mitts, a mask, a stiffened
coat, with pack-thread stays, a tucker, ruffles, bib, apron,
necklace, and fan, was indeed a typical example of the fashionable
follies of the day."278

The school girl in a fashionable boarding-school dressed extravagantly
fine. One of the daughters, twelve years of age,
of General Huntington of Norwich, Conn., was placed in a
boarding-school in Boston. She had twelve silk gowns but
her teacher wrote that the girl must have another gown of a
"recently imported rich fabric," which was got for her so
that she might dress "suitable to her rank and station."

Another Boston school girl, twelve years of age, in 1772,
describes her own evening dress thus:

"I was dress'd in my yellow coat, black bib       apron, black
feathers on my head, my past comb,       all my past garnet
marquesett       jet pins, together with my silver plume       my
loket, black mitts       2 or 3 yards of blue ribbin, (black       blue
is high tast) striped tucker and ruffels (not my best)       my
silk shoes compleated my dress."279

This same school girl, in her diary four months later, tells
us of her famous headdress:

"I had my HEDDUS roll on, aunt Storer said it ought to
be made less, Aunt Deming said it ought not to be made at
all. It makes my head itch,       ach,       burn like anything
Mamma. This famous roll is not made wholly of a red Cow
Tail, but is a mixture of that,       horsehair (very course)       a
little human hair of yellow hue, that I suppose was taken out
of the back part of an old wig. But D               made it (our
head) all carded together and twisted up. When it first came
home, aunt put it on,       my new cap on it, she then took up
her apron       mesur'd me,       from the roots of my hair on my
forehead to the top of my notions, I mesur'd above an inch
longer than I did downwards from the roots of my hair to
the end of my chin. Nothing renders a young person more[Pg 363]
amiable than virtue       modesty without the help of fals hair,
red Cow tail or D               (the barber)."280

The little girl's complexion had to be protected by a mask
of cloth or velvet from the healthy coloring of the sun. "Little
Dolly Payne, who afterwards became the wife of President
Madison, went to school wearing 'a white linen mask to keep
every ray of sunshine from the complexion, a sunbonnet sewed
on her head every morning by her careful mother, and long
gloves covering the hands and arms.'"281

These little girls wore vast hoop-petticoats. They wore
high-heeled shoes made of silk, morocco, or light stuff. They
wore stays and corsets, and even the poor little boys had to
wear them.

"I have seen children's stays, made of heavy strips of
board and steel, tightly wrought with heavy buckram or canvas
into an iron frame like an instrument of torture. These
had been worn by a little girl five years old. Staymakers
advertised stays, jumps, gazzets, costrells, and caushets (which
were doubtless corsets) for ladies and children, 'to make them
appear strait.' And I have been told of tin corsets for little
girls, but I have never seen any such abominations. One pair
of stays was labelled as having been worn by a boy when five
years old. There certainly is a suspicious suggestion in some
of these little fellows' portraits of whalebone and buckram."282

"From the deacons' records of the Dutch Reformed Church
at Albany, we catch occasional hints of the dress of the children
of the Dutch colonists. There was no poorhouse, and few
poor; but since the church occasionally helped worthy folk
who were not rich, we find the deacons in 1665 and 1666 paying
for blue linen for schorteldoecykers, or aprons, for Albany
kindeken; also for haaken en oogen, or hooks and eyes, for
warm under-waists called borsrockyen. They bought linen
for luyers, which were neither pinning-blankets nor diapers,
but a sort of swaddling clothes, which evidently were worn
then by Dutch babies. Voor-schooten, which were white bibs;
neerstucken, which were tuckers, also were worn by little children.
Some little Hans or Pieter had given to him by the
deacons a fine little scarlet aperock, or monkey-jacket; and
other children were furnished linen cosynties, or night-caps[Pg 364]
with capes. Yellow stockings were sold at the same time for
children, and a gay little yellow turkey-legged Dutchman in
a scarlet monkey-jacket and fat little breeches must have
been a jolly sight."283


Food. The early colonists in the United States fared poorly
at first in the way of food and there was a scarcity of food
among them for some time. Yet there was an abundance of
fish and oysters and clams and wild nuts and berries and wild
game. After they had learned how to gather these in and also
what to plant and how to plant there was a plenty if not
abundance. Not having a great number of cooking utensils,
they learned from the Indians and devised ways of cooking
without utensils. They broiled meats and fish on the bare
live coals; they roasted Irish potatoes, sweet potatoes, green
corn, and squashes by burying them in the hot ashes; apples
and eggs and green corn were baked by laying them on the
hearth between the andirons; they would bake cakes of Indian
corn meal and of buckwheat and rye flour before the fire on a
flat stone, a hoe, an oak board, or a pewter plate. The breakfast
was usually a frugal one, consisting of a porridge of peas and
beans, with a savor of meat, cheese, maybe beer or tea, but
often milk and bread. One peculiar custom with the dinner,
generally served exactly at noon, was that usually there was
a pudding and which was eaten first. This might have been
an Indian pudding, made of Indian corn meal mixed with
dried fruit. Among some of the more frugal the supper was
often of mush and milk. In some parts of the country at least,
it was a custom on the occasion of a dinner to which guests
were invited to send to those who could not be present a
"taste" of the different dishes, and this was done particularly
to sick neighbors.

Wheat did not do well at first but oats grew all right and
quite a good deal was raised, so that oatmeal was used and
oatmeal porridge became a rather popular dish. Indian corn,
maize, was the staple grain of the colonists. When they first
came to America they found this grain growing and they
learned from the Indians how to plant it, raise it, grind it,
and cook it. The foods made from this corn still retain their
Indian names, as samp, supawn, pone, succotash, hominy.

Samp was the corn pounded to a coarsely ground powder.
Supawn was a thick corn-meal and milk porridge. Another
way of preparing the corn by the Indians was called nocake[Pg 365]
or nookick, in which the corn was parched in the hot ashes,
then taken up and the ashes sifted out, and then beaten into
a powder. This was used on journeys, being put into a pouch,
and it was quite sustaining as a small amount of it sufficed for
a meal. Johnny-cake was made of corn-meal boiled with
water, probably the same as our mush now. They also roasted
the green corn, roasting-ears, and parched the dried corn.

A corn-husking of 1767 in Massachusetts is thus described
in a diary of that time. "Made a husking Entertainm't.
Possibly this leafe may last a Century and fall into the hands
of some inquisitive Person for whose Entertainm't I will
inform him that now there is a Custom amongst us of making
an Entertainm't at husking of Indian Corn whereto all the
neighboring Swains are invited and after the Corn is finished
they like the Hottentots give three Cheers or huzza's but
cannot carry in the husks without a Rhum bottle; they feign
great Exertion but do nothing till Rhum enlivens them, when
all is done in a trice, then after a hasty Meal about 10 at
Night they go to their pastimes."284

The corn was shelled by hand or by raking the ear across
the edge of a shovel or other piece of sharp iron and then
ground in stone mortars with pestles or in wooden mortars.
Later came "querns," hand-mills, which from the descriptions,
must have been similar to the ones used by the Scotch
housewives of the earlier times, as described in another place
in this book. Then in Massachusetts came the first wind-mill
in 1631 and the first water-mill in 1633.

When the colonists came to this country, they found the
rivers and seas abounding with fish. It is stated that some
of the rivers were so full of fish that horses ridden into them
would step on the fish and kill them. The Indians killed them
in the brooks by striking them with sticks and the colonists
scooped them out alive with pans. In 1614, after having left
Virginia, John Smith went to New England for whale and
he found cod instead and in one month he caught sixty thousand
of the cod. Two popular fish today, the shad and the
salmon, were so common that the colonists were really ashamed
to be seen eating them in their homes. A writer in 1636 stated
that, "I myself at the turning of the tyde have seen such
multitudes of sea bass that it seemed to me that one might goe
over their backs dri-shod."285[Pg 366]

Not only were there great numbers of fish, but also a great
many different kinds, one writer of 1672 told of over two hundred
kinds that were caught in the waters of New England.
Not only was there great quantity and great variety but also
great size. Writers of these early times tell of lobsters weighing
twenty-five pounds and five and six feet long, and of
oysters that were a foot or more across.

At the first the settlers were poorly provided with fishing-tackle,
but it was soon brought in from across the sea and a
great industry arose. Fishing-vessels were fitted out and the
product sold to the colonies and Europe. "With every fishing-vessel
that left Gloucester and Marblehead, the chief centres
of the fishing industries, went a boy of ten or twelve to
learn to be a skilled fisherman. He was called a 'cut-tail,' for
he cut a wedge-shaped bit from the tail of every fish he caught,
and when the fish were sorted out the cut-tails showed the
boy's share of the profit."286

There was likewise a great abundance of wild game. Deer
were found everywhere. They were at first without fear and
came in droves near to the colonists. But this was not for
long as the colonists began to kill them in great numbers, both
for the food and for the hides. Wild turkeys were likewise
plentiful at first and of great size, as they weighed thirty and
forty and even sixty pounds. They came in flocks of a hundred
or more and were destroyed as the deer, and in a short
time they had disappeared from the settled parts, by 1690
rarely found near the coasts of New England. Wild geese
were found in flocks of thousands. Doves were very plentiful.
There were wild pigeons in vast quantities, so much so that in
their flight the sun would be obscured and the sky darkened
for some length of time, and where they roosted the limbs
were broken off the trees and sometimes even the largest limbs
and again the trees might be almost stripped of their limbs
by the weight of the pigeons. There were many other kinds
of game birds, as the pheasant, quail, woodcock, plover, snipe,
curlew, and the like. Rabbits and squirrels were so numerous
as to be a very great pest and in many places bounties were
paid for their heads. "The Swedish traveler, Kalm, said that
in Pennsylvania in one year, 1749, £8,000 was paid out for
heads of black and gray squirrels, at three pence a head,[Pg 367]
which would show that over six hundred thousand were
killed."287

There was an abundance of wild nuts which could be gathered
and used, such as walnuts, hickory-nuts, chestnuts, hazelnuts,
and the like. There were plenty of wild berries, as
huckleberries, blackberries, and strawberries, and likewise
wild grapes. The colonists used the pawpaw and other wild
fruits found in the woods. "The North Carolinians even made
puddings and what they called tarts of the American pawpaw."288
They planted out apple-trees and peach-trees and
other kinds of fruit trees and it was not many years till there
was plenty of these cultivated fruits. The apples were especially
valuable to them and used in various ways, applesauce,
and apple-butter were made in great quantity by each
family. "They made preserves and conserves, marmalets and
quiddonies, hypocras and household wines, usquebarbs and
cordials. They candied fruits and made syrups. They preserved
everything that would bear preserving. I have seen
old-time receipts for preserving quinces, 'respasse,' pippins,
'apricocks,' plums, 'damsins,' peaches, oranges, lemons, artichokes,
green walnuts, elecampane roots, eringo roots, grapes,
barberries, cherries; receipts for syrup of clove gillyflower,
wormwood, mint, aniseed, clove, elder, lemons, marigolds,
citron, hyssop, liquorice; receipts for conserves of roses, violets,
borage flowers, rosemary, betony, sage, mint, lavender,
marjoram, and 'piony;' rules for candying fruit, berries, and
flowers, for poppy water, cordial, cherry water, lemon water,
thyme water, Angelica water, Aqua Mirabilis, Aqua Cœlestis,
clary water, mint water."289

The natives not only gave to the colonists the valuable
Indian corn, but also with it three vegetables that are yet to
this day raised in the field with this grain, being the pumpkin,
the squash, and the bean. They also got the potato, both Irish
and sweet, from the natives, but the colonists did not learn
for quite a time how to prepare the Irish potato properly and
so at first it was not liked and not greatly used. They supplemented
the native list of vegetables with those grown in
Europe, and so it was not long till they had growing peas and
turnips and parsnips and carrots and cucumbers and many
others.[Pg 368]

Another product which they obtained from the natives,
although not food, almost seemed to take its place as food,
which was tobacco. This became about as great a necessity
with the colonists as food and its use became general in all
the colonies and among all classes of people, and even with
women. If there was one people above all the other colonists
in the use of tobacco it was the New York Dutch, who smoked
incessantly, and yet the New Englanders were not far away
from the lead. "Boston was the best market for snuff. The
early lawmakers of Massachusetts had sought to put tobacco
under ban, or at least to hamper it, after the example set in
England, where tobacco was forbidden in ale-houses because
it was believed to excite a thirst for strong drink. But revered
preachers became fond of the pipe, and the restrictions
were quite broken down by their example. Groups of New
England ministers were wont to fill a room so full of smoke
that it became stifling. Long before the close of the seventeenth
century, ladies of social standing in New England
'smoked it,' as the phrase ran; and in 1708 one finds the Governor
of Massachusetts showing friendly feeling by sociably
smoking a pipe with the wife of Judge Sewall."290

The colonists found another food in the woods that helped
them out greatly and that was wild honey, which helped to
fill the need of sugar which was very scarce with them. They
also got a supply of sweetening from the sugar-maple tree,
whose sap they learned to use in making sugar and syrup.
This became quite an important industry and helped to give
a greater variety of cooked foods. This sugar making was
important enough in Virginia to have it written about by
Governor Berkeley, wherein he called the maple the sugar-tree.
"The Sugar-Tree yields a kind of Sap or Juice which
by boiling is made into Sugar. This Juice is drawn out, by
wounding the Trunk of the Tree, and placing a Receiver
under the Wound. It is said that the Indians make one
Pound of Sugar out of eight Pounds of the Liquor. It is
bright and moist with a full large Grain, the Sweetness of it
being like that of good Muscovada."291

But the colonists did not altogether rely upon honey and
maple-sugar for their sweetening as many families did keep
a supply of sugar, and especially to sweeten the tea. This
was in the form of a loaf or cone, called loaf-sugar, which[Pg 369]
weighed nine or ten pounds, and one cone would usually last
a family an entire year. The sugar was cut up into lumps of
equal and regular size by the women of the household, for
which purpose they had sugar-shears or sugar-cutters.

The colonists began to raise cattle and hogs and sheep and
so when wild game became scarce the domestic animals furnished
the meat. There were no ways for keeping meat fresh
for any length of time after it was killed and so it had to be
preserved by being salted and pickled. They had smoke-houses
for smoking and curing beef, ham, and bacon. They
made sausage and head-cheese and rendered out the lard and
the tallow. "Sausage-meat was thus prepared in New York
farmhouses. The meat was cut coarsely into half-inch pieces
and thrown into wooden boxes about three feet long and ten
inches deep. Then its first chopping was by men using spades
which had been ground to a sharp edge."292

With the raising of Indian corn and the clearing of ground
so that grass might grow abundantly, the number of cows increased
till in the eighteenth century milk and its products
became quite an important industry. Mrs. Earle concludes
that butter was not made by many families in the seventeenth
century because of there being so few churns, as she states
that in the inventories of the property of the early settlers of
Maine there is but one churn named. But by the eighteenth
century the care of cream and butter-making went on in every
household in the country and with many in the town. Cheese,
too, became a leading product and one of the staple foods.


Drink. At the time of the settlement of America, water
was not used in Europe as a constant drink, and hence the
colonists were used to other drinks and one of their greatest
complaints upon their first living in the new country was on
account of their being deprived of the old country drinks.
Governor Bradford of the Pilgrims in Massachusetts complained
loudly and frequently of this deprivation while the
Salem minister, Higginson, in 1629, boasted of his ability to
drink water. "Whereas my stomach could only digest and
did require such a drink as was both strong and stale, I can and
ofttimes do drink New England water very well."293 The
colonists were not long without their beverages for one of
their very first importations from England was beer, and soon
they were manufacturing ale and beer themselves, and in 1675[Pg 370]
Cotton Mather stated that every other house in Boston was
an ale-house.

Although for a short time the colonists might have had
to use water, yet that did not change their taste for other
drinks, and through manufactures and importations, the
country became flooded with liquors and the drink-habit became
universal. There was no class of people among the
colonists that would be considered temperate according to
present-day standards. Drink was a part of every transaction,
of every doing in both public and private life, as, auctions,
buyings and sellings, signing a deed, drawing up a contract;
house-raisings, the moving into a new house, the arrival
and departure of friends; the election of officers, the assembling
of a court, the arbitration of a suit; funerals, weddings,
the birth of a child; the ordaining of deacons, the induction of
a new minister, the assembling of a body of clergymen, the
opening of a yearly Quaker meeting, and even religious meetings
in private houses.

"In Boston, and perhaps elsewhere, the great punch-bowl
came on the table first of all; the master of the house, after
setting an example, sent around the table the cup that he had
drunk from, that each guest might drink in turn. A 'generous
bottle' of fiery Madeira topped off every dinner among the
gentry in New York. In Virginia a host now and then showed
his hospitality by locking the door and cheerily notifying his
guests that no man might depart until all were drunk."294

As was stated above, before coming to this country the
colonists were unaccustomed to the use of water as a constant
beverage and upon arriving in America they complained bitterly
at having to drink water. They not only considered it
a hardship to be deprived of their accustomed drinks, but also
they had been trained to consider it dangerous to health to
drink water. Water was believed to contain matter injurious
to health and so they really seemed to have dreaded its use
and all the more so because in those days there was no
analyzing of the water to learn of its ingredients and the
mystery and lore surrounding it made it seem all the more
dangerous. Being compelled to use water upon their arrival
in America, the Puritan settlers were greatly surprised that
instead of being injurious it was found to agree with them and
that there was improvement in health instead of deterioration.
This fact so impressed Governor Winthrop that he continued[Pg 371]
water as a constant drink in his family and in 1630 he stopped
the custom of drinking healths at his table. This example of
their chief officer must have had its influence, for laws were
passed against excessive drinking and drunkenness and
against drinking healths in public and thus was tried to keep
down so great drinking. These laws had some good effects
for during the seventeenth century, judged at least by the
standards of their times, it would appear for the great part
that the New Englanders were sober and law-abiding.

It must be recognized that at the time of the settlement of
America by European colonies, alcoholic stimulants were considered
a necessary part of living, about as necessary a provision
as bread, and, further, that water was looked upon as
really dangerous to health. So it need not be so greatly wondered
at that the colonists were so much given to drink almost
anything and everything but water and also it may
account somewhat for the many kinds of drinks, for not only
were they seeking drinks that were palatable but also that
were healthful. They not only imported all kinds of drinks
but manufactured them here and likewise experimented with
materials that were found here but not in Europe, as the
Indian corn and other plants. Yet the above does not hide
the fact that the colonists were great drinkers and that they
drank because they wanted to and would have drank, excuse
or no excuse. Nevertheless, there were efforts made against
drunkenness even in those days and some good starts made,
too.

The colonists made whisky from rye, wheat, barley, and
also from potatoes and Indian corn. They imported rum from
the West Indies and, too, imported the molasses and made the
rum themselves. "The making of rum aided and almost supported
the slave-trade in this country. The poor negroes were
bought on the coast of Africa by New England sea-captains
and merchants and paid for with barrels of New England
rum. These slaves were then carried on slave-ships to the
West Indies, and sold at a large profit to planters and slave-dealers
for a cargo of molasses. This was brought to New
England, distilled into rum, and sent off to Africa. Thus the
circle of molasses, rum, and slaves was completed."295 Beer
was the first drink, and even among the very first articles
imported from England by the Puritan settlers. They soon
learned to make beer from the Indian corn and "the pious[Pg 372]
Puritans quickly learned to cheat in their brewing, using
molasses and coarse sugar."296 The Dutch established breweries
at New York and Albany and they were great beer-drinkers.
The English colonists, both in New England and in
Virginia, were not such great users of beer, but found other
drinks to take its place. One such drink was metheglin or
mead, made from honey, yeast, and water in England, while
in this country it was learned as well to make it from the
sweet-bean of the honey-locust and also by a concoction of
honey and a liquid from a mixture of various herbs, and which
was considered a fine drink. In Virginia a home-made beer
was made from Indian corn meal, from the green stalks of
the Indian corn, from baked cakes of a paste of persimmons,
from potatoes, and from artichokes. In New England the
small beer was made by a mixture of a decoction made from
spruce or birch or sassafras twigs and molasses and water or
by boiling the twigs in the sap of the sugar maple. There
were plenty of wines imported and vineyards were planted
and wines were made by the colonists. Also brandies were
imported and manufactured.

As apple orchards increased and apples became plentiful,
cider became the great drink in New England. It became the
common drink of the people and it was made in vast quantities.
It was very cheap and used everywhere, being used in
large amounts by students at college, given to children at
meals, furnished to travelers and to Indians, and indeed to
any one who wished it. "Beverige" was another common
drink, mild in its character, made in various ways, one way
being of water flavored with molasses and ginger. Another
such drink was sillabub, in one form made of cider with sugar,
nutmeg, and cream added. There were many other kinds of
drinks, as, switchel, similar to beverige, ebulum made from the
juice of the elder and juniper berries mixed with ale and
spices, perry made from pears, peachy made from peaches,
apple-jack distilled from cider, flip made of small beer and
sweetened with sugar or molasses or dried pumpkin and rum
added and also made in other ways. Beside all the drinks
enumerated here there were various other kinds.

"A terrible drink is said to have been popular in Salem       a
drink with a terrible name       whistle-belly-vengeance. It
consisted of sour household beer simmered in a kettle, sweet[Pg 373]ened
with molasses, filled with brown-bread crumbs and drunk
piping hot."297

In the early years of the colonists, they did not have tea
or coffee or chocolate as drinks since they were not in use in
England at the time. It was not till about the last third of
the seventeenth century that these drinks were introduced
into the colonies and it was not till the first part of the
eighteenth century that their use had become any ways general.
About this time came the porcelain ware specially designed
for the use of tea and lacquered tables on which to
serve it and tea-drinking became fashionable throughout the
country. In Virginia upon the calling of the young men of
afternoons the young ladies served them with tea. The Dutch
of New York served tea with a lump of sugar at each cup,
which was placed in the mouth and kept there while the tea
was being sipped. In the early introduction of tea into New
England, it was not understood just how to prepare it. Sometimes
the tea was boiled quite a while till it was bitter and
then drank without milk or sugar. Again, after the boiling
of the tea the liquid was poured off and the cooked leaves
eaten and to make them more to the taste the leaves were
buttered and salted. It is unexplainable how people who were
not afraid of any drink whatever providing it was not water
should have feared to drink tea, and yet such was the case.
"When tea-drinking began to be general there were many utterances
against it, such terms being used as "detestable
weed," "base exotick," "rank poison far-fetched and dear
bought," "base and unworthy Indian drink." Many ill
effects were ascribed to tea-drinking, such as the frequent
decay and loss of teeth in America and ill-health in general
and as being especially injurious to the mind. During the
time just before and at the Revolution tea was proscribed by
the women loyal to the cause of America and many substitutes
arose, as, the raspberry, loose-strife, goldenrod, dittany, blackberry,
yaupon, sage, strawberry, currant, thoroughwort, ribwort,
and many others. Of all the substitute tea-drinks, Liberty
Tea was the most esteemed. "It was thus made: the
four-leaved loose-strife was pulled up like flax, its stalks were
stripped of the leaves and boiled; the leaves were put in an
iron kettle and basted with the liquor from the stalks. Then
the leaves were put in an oven and dried. Liberty Tea sold[Pg 374]
for sixpence a pound. It was drunk at every spinning-bee,
quilting, or other gathering of women."298

"At the time of the Stamp Act, when patriotic Americans
threw the tea into Boston harbor, Americans were just as
great tea-drinkers as the English. Now it is not so. The
English drink much more tea than we do; and the habit of
coffee-drinking, first acquired in the Revolution, has descended
from generation to generation, and we now drink more coffee
than tea. This is one of the differences in our daily life caused
by the Revolution."299

In 1670 a license to sell coffee and chocolate was granted
for an inn in Boston, which seems to be the first mention of
the use of coffee. From this time on, other innkeepers obtained
license to sell coffee and then came the establishment
of regular coffee-houses. This drink also came into use in
private families and coffee-pots and coffee-mugs and coffee
dishes were brought in expressly for this use. As with tea,
some people did not know at first how to prepare the coffee
and so sometimes the whole beans were boiled without being
crushed or ground. It is presumed that then the liquor was
poured off and the cooked beans eaten as in the case with the
leaves of the tea, but no statements are made that such was
really the fact. Chocolate, too, came into use at this time, and
it soon became quite a popular drink and mills to grind the
cocoa were established in Boston.

Whatever prejudice the colonists may have had against the
use of water as a drink, they certainly had none against the
use of milk. Milk was used from the first and cows were increased
in number and milk became very cheap, as in 1630
the statement was made by a minister of that time that milk
cost but a penny a quart in Salem. It is found that writers
among the colonists placed as being used together milk and
bread, milk and hasty pudding, milk and baked apples, and
milk and berries.


Food and Drink of Children. There is not a great deal
left to us in the writings preserved from colonial times in
reference to the food and drink of children of those days.
But it is safe to judge that very much what the adults had
the children would have had, modified to suit the needs of the
different ages and added to such would be some things that
are used mostly in childhood, as sweetmeats and the like.[Pg 375]

There was an abundance of food for children but not so
great a variety. Among the good things were the cereal
foods, which were plentiful and varied, many of such having
been made from the Indian corn, as, samp, hominy, supawn,
pone, succotash, described in another part of this chapter.
Beans also were common and made good food for children.
There were fruits, as, pears, apples, peaches, and cherries, and
also prunes, figs, currants and raisins. There were several
kinds of berries, some ripening in the summer and others in
the fall, which the children gathered, and, too, there were
plenty of nuts for them to gather in.

Sweetmeats for children were plentiful among the colonists
even in the early days. There were sugar and molasses from
which to make sweet things for the children, not omitting
maple sugar. Raisins were brought in by the ships in large
quantities for they were quite a dainty with the colonial children
and in great demand. There was not a great variety of
candy, among such being lemon-peel candy, angelica candy,
rock candy, sugar candy, Black Jack, and Gibraltar Rock. It
would be surmised that this latter named candy must have
had lasting qualities like the all-day sucker of the present-day
child. Rock-candy was the favorite and great amounts of it
were brought in from China by the ships, one vessel having
brought in at one time sixty tubs of this candy. There were
candied eryngo-root, candied lemon-peel, and sugared coriander-seeds.
The children had plenty of cakes those days and
each city had some one confectioner or baker who was noted
for his cakes. Boston had Meer's cakes. There were cookies,
crullers, egg cakes, marchpanes, maccaroons, and other kinds.

Much less is given about the drink of children of colonial
times than even about the food. Mrs. Earle found in an old
almanac of the eighteenth century, where advice was given on
the "Easy Rearing of Children," that young children should
never be allowed to drink cold drinks, but should always have
their beer a little heated. Children were given all the cider
they wanted, even very little children drank it. Fortunately
for the colonial children milk was very plentiful and cheap so
they had plenty of that to drink. That children were given
the drinks of their elders is shown in the following:

"This picture has been given by Sargent of country funerals
in the days of his youth: 'When I was a boy, and was
at an academy in the country, everybody went to everybody's
funeral in the village. The population was small, funerals[Pg 376]
rare; the preceptor's absence would have excited remarks, and
the boys were dismissed for the funeral. A table with liquors
was always provided. Every one, as he entered, took off his
hat with his left hand, smoothed down his hair with his
right, walked up to the coffin, gazed upon the corpse, made
a crooked face, passed on to the table, took a glass of his favorite
liquor, went forth upon the plat before the house and
talked politics, or of the new road, or compared crops, or
swapped heifers, or horses until it was time to lift. A clergyman
told me that when settled at Concord, N.      H., he officiated
at the funeral of a little boy. The body was borne
in a chaise, and six little nominal pall-bearers, the oldest not
thirteen, walked by the side of the vehicle. Before they left
the house a sort of master of ceremonies took them to the
table and mixed a tumbler of gin, water, and sugar for
each.'"300


Infancy. It would be expected that a child born in any
new country would have to undergo hardships, and this was
particularly true of a child born in a rugged climate as in
New England and among the early settlers who were so
poorly prepared to withstand the rigors of a winter of that
region. In a severe climate, with houses not very warmly
built and so poorly heated that within a yard of the fire-place
on a very cold day water would freeze, it could not be possible
for a baby always or even ever to be kept comfortable.

Both in Dutch New York and Puritan New England the
babe of a few days old was taken to the meeting-house to be
baptized. This usually occurred among the Puritans on the
first Sunday following the child's birth, whether summer or
winter, whatever the weather, and it must take place in the
meeting-house. As these meeting-houses had no fires in them,
often on many a cold day the water in the christening-bowl
froze and the ice had to be broken and the icy water was
used on the child of less than a week old. The weather might
be too cold for some of the adults to attend the ceremony but
never too cold for the baby, as is shown in the following
record made on January 22, 1694, in the diary of Judge
Samuel Sewall of Boston. "A very extraordinary Storm by
reason of the falling and driving of Snow. Few women
could get to Meeting. A Child named Alexander was baptized
in the afternoon."301 Worst of all, one Puritan parson[Pg 377]
is recorded as immersing the infants and he only stopped the
dangerous and cruel practice when his own little babe nearly
lost its life by such.

There was great mortality among infants in the colonial
times and especially in the earlier days. In one family of
fourteen children, but three outlived the father, the majority
of the children dying in infancy; in another family of fifteen
children but two survived the father, and of these, too, the
greater number died in infancy; in a third family five children
in succession died in infancy, so that when the mother
had been married nine years she had one living child and
there were five little graves to tell the story of her life and
sufferings.

In the seventeenth century medicine was yet being influenced
by astrology and necromancy, there being quite a
strong belief in occult influences. Consequently there was
recorded the birth not only in the year, month, and day, but
as well the hour and minute, so that it might be ascertained
under what planet the child was born and thus be reckoned
what influences for good or evil were ascendent at his birth.

The most common diseases of infancy at the time were
worms, rickets, and fits, to use their plain Anglo-Saxon terms.
The most famous medicines for the cure of rickets used snails
as the basis of its formation, one noted receipt for making
this snail water comes down to us as follows:

"The admirable and most famous Snail water.       Take a
peck of garden Shel Snails, wash them well in Small Beer,
and put them in an oven till they have done making a Noise,
then take them out and wipe them well from the green froth
that is upon them, and bruise them shels and all in a Stone
Mortar, then take a Quart of Earthworms, scowre them with
salt, slit them, and wash well with water from their filth,
and in a stone Mortar beat them in pieces, then lay in the
bottom of your distilled pot Angelica two handfuls, and two
handfuls of Celandine upon them, to which put two quarts
of Rosemary flowers, Bearsfoot, Agrimony, red Dock roots,
Bark of Barberries, Betony wood Sorrel of each two handfuls,
Rue one handful; then lay the Snails and Worms on
top of the hearbs and flowers, then pour on three Gallons of
the Strongest Ale, and let it stand all night, in the morning
put in three ounces of Cloves beaten, sixpennyworth of
beaten Saffron, and on the top of them six ounces of shaved
Hartshorne, then set on the Limbeck, and close it with paste[Pg 378]
and so receive the water by pintes, which will be nine in all,
the first is the strongest, whereof take in the morning two
spoonfuls in four spoonfuls of small Beer, the like in the
Afternoon."302

For worms and fits snails also were used, with senna and
rhubarb and prunes. For teething there was a famous Anodyne
Necklace, which was warranted to cure all disorders
from teething, providing it was properly used. There were
other remedies for teething, one of which was to scratch the
child's gums with an osprey bone, and another was to hang
a string of fawn's teeth or wolf's fangs around the baby's
neck.

There was a custom that prevailed in which a dinner was
given to the midwife, nurses, and the other women who had
given help in the way of work or advice during the first week
or two of the child's life. This occurred about the end of the
child's second week. This was a good substantial meal, at
one place consisting of "rost Beef and minc'd Pyes, good
Cheese and Tarts," and another dinner was of "Boil'd Pork,
Beef, Fowls, very good Rost Beef, Turkey, Pye and Tarts."
There was also a custom of visiting the young babe and
mother at which presents of money, clothing, or trinkets were
given to the nurse. A usual gift to the young babe was a
pincushion. This was quite fancifully made and the child's
name with a welcome was made with pins stuck in the cushion
or sewed on in steel beads, the pins being stuck about it.

"The baby was carried upstairs, when first moved, with
silver and gold in his hand to bring him wealth and cause
him always to rise in the world, just as babies are carried
upstairs by superstitious nurses nowadays, and he had 'scarlet
laid on his head to keep him from harm.'"303

There were cradles for these early babies, among the Puritans
and Dutch, each with a deep hood to protect the child
from the chilly drafts that were constantly occurring in the
poorly heated houses, and for twins there were hoods at both
ends of the cradle. There were wooden cradles, which often
were paneled or carved. There were also wicker cradles, one
of which still preserved, Mrs. Earle states, is one of the
few authentic articles still surviving that came over on the
Mayflower, and which cradle was used by Peregrine White,
the first white child born in Plymouth. There was also used[Pg 379]
as a cradle an Indian basket with handles at the ends whereby
it was hung up on a wooden standard or frame. But perhaps
the cradle most common in the earlier colonial years
was one made of birch bark by the Indian women and obtained
from them by the white mothers. The covering for the
babe in the cradle was a homespun blanket or a pressed quilt.
The blanket or "flannel sheet" was made of the finest whitest
wool, usually having the baby's initials marked on it.

"A finer coverlet, one of state, the christening blanket, was
usually made of silk, richly embroidered, sometimes with a
text of Scripture. These were often lace-bordered or edged
with a narrow home-woven silk fringe. The christening
blanket of Governor Bradford of the Plymouth Colony still
exists, whole of fabric and unfaded of dye. It is a rich crimson
silk, soft of texture, like a heavy sarcenet silk, and is
powdered at regular distances about six inches apart with
conventional sprays of flowers embroidered chiefly in pink
and yellow, in minute and beautiful cross-stitch. It is distinctly
Oriental in appearance.... Another beautiful silk
christening blanket was quilted in an intricate flower
pattern in almost imperceptible stitches. These formal wrappings
of state were sometimes called bearing-cloths or clothes,
and served through many generations. Shakespeare speaks
in Henry VI. of a child's bearing-cloth."304

In New England a go-cart or standing-stool was often used
in teaching a baby to walk. As the mother must go to church
and as, of course, the baby must go along, there was sometimes
a little wooden cage, or something similar, to hold the
young baby, while in the church.


Number and Names of Children. It is, perhaps, true that
in a new country the average number of children to a family
is greater than in older settled places. Although there were
many instances of quite large families among the colonists of
the United States, yet, as was noted under Infancy, there
were so many deaths among the little ones that there were
many families with a small number of children. Children
were welcomed by the colonists and there was plenty of room
for them and each child could find work about him to make
himself helpful and not burdensome.

There are records of very large families. One mother had
twenty-six children, one man was the father of thirty children,
and families of fifteen children were not rare. Cotton[Pg 380]
Mather states that, "One woman had not less than twenty-two
children, and another had not less than twenty-three children
by one husband, whereof nineteen lived to man's estate, and
a third was mother to seven and twenty children."305

There seemingly was no particular trouble about finding
names for all these children. Except among the Puritans
double names were rarely given before the time of the Revolution.
There were various reasons for naming the children
and often the poor little babe was burdened with a name that
must, as looked at nowadays, have caused it when older much
pain and anger at its parents for inflicting such a punishment
so unjustly deserved in its helpless state. Often the God-fearing
parents sought out names of deep significance, such
as they thought would affect the child's life and be productive
of good upon its career. An expectant mother being widowed
by the death of her husband in a snowstorm, upon the birth
of her child named it Fathergone. A child named Seaborn
told its place of birth in its name. Among the Puritans of
New England names as the following were common and
show by their significance why the children were so named:
Deliverance, Temperance, Endurance, Patience, Silence, Submit,
Rejoice, Comfort, Hoped For, Peace, Joy, Faith, Love,
Hope, Charity.

"The children of Roger Clap were named Experience,
Waitstill, Preserved, Hopestill, Wait, Thanks, Desire, Unite,
and Supply. Madam Austin, an early settler of old Narragansett,
had sixteen children. Their names were Parvis, Picus,
Piersus, Prisemus, Polybius, Lois, Lettice, Avis, Anstice,
Eunice, Mary, John, Elizabeth, Ruth, Freelove. All lived to
be three-score and ten, one to be a hundred and two years old.
Edward Bendall's children were named Truegrace, Reform,
Hoped for, More mercy, and Restore. Richard Gridley's offspring
were Return, Believe, and Tremble."306


Child Welfare. There is no doubt that the welfare of their
children was considered by the colonists, as with any body of
people, but the hardships of a settling people would react
upon child life as well as upon adult life. Much of the
seeming harshness of the Puritan settlers toward their children
was brought forth by the stern necessities under which
they had to live as well as the sternness of their religious
ideas. They did not try to find for themselves easy paths[Pg 381]
of going and they did not always see that these paths were
extremely rough for young and tender feet. This is illustrated
in the writings of one of them who was giving advice
on the rearing of children, in which he urged that boys should
go without hats to harden them and children's feet should be
wet in cold water and also they should wear thin-soled shoes
in order to toughen the feet. Whether following the suggestions
of this writer or not, the parents of Josiah Quincy
did act in accord with them for when he was but three years
of age, in winter and summer, they would take him out of
his bed of a morning and carry him to a cellar kitchen and
dip him three times in a tub of cold water fresh from the
pump, and also no attention was paid to the care of his feet,
so that in his boyhood his feet were wet for half the time or
more.

This rough treatment of children is likewise shown in reference
to their position at meals. In those old days children
were often not permitted to be seated at their meals but they
were to stand and eat as rapidly as possible, so as to get out
of the way and troubling of the adults, and to keep quiet and
make no complaint at their treatment. Sometimes the children
had to stand at the side of the table and eat their food
standing, while the parents and the other adults were seated.
Again, the children would stand behind their parents and
the other grown people and receive such food as would be
handed back to them from the table, just as with the household
animals. In other families the children stood at a side-table
and they would take their trenchers to the large table
to receive the food to take back to their own table to eat.

That these early people were deeply interested in their
children's welfare and appreciated their hardships is shown
by the following statements from the writings of Governor
Bradford:

"As necessitie was a taskmaster over them, so they were
forced to be such, not only to their servants, but in a sorte,
to their dearest children; the which, as it did not a little
wound ye tender hearts of many a loving father and mother,
so it produced likewise sundrie sad and sorrowful effects.
For many of their children, that were of best dispositions and
gracious inclinations, haveing lernde to bear ye yoake in
their youth, and willing to bear parte of their parents burdens,
were often times so oppressed with their hevie labours,
that though their minds were free and willing, yet their[Pg 382]
bodies bowed under ye weight of ye same, and became decreped
in their early youth; the vigor of nature being consumed
in ye very budd as it were. But that which was more
lamentable and of all sorrowes most heavie to be borne, was,
that many of their children, by these occasions, and ye great
licentiousness of youth in ye countrie, and ye manifold temptations
of the place, were drawn away by evil examples into
extravagante and dangerous courses, getting ye raines off
their neks and departing from their parents. Some became
souldiers, other took upon them for viages by sea, and other
some worse courses, tending to disoluteness and the danger of
their soules, to ye great greef of their parents and dishonor
of God. So that they saw their posteritie would be in danger
to degenerate and be corrupted."307


Manners and Courtesy of Children. One of the characteristics
of the age of chivalry in Europe was the bearing of
the young people toward their elders and superiors and parents,
and this idea was carried down through the ages and
even was brought to America, so that the character of the
colonial child was greatly influenced by those old laws of
courtesy. Such often made little boys and girls act as older
people and to be dressed in an oldish way. Little girls were
frequently addressed with the stiff term Mistress, even the
term Miss not being strong enough as it was deemed to be
lacking in dignity, designating childishness and flippancy
and lack of character. In a written funeral tribute to a little
girl of seven, she was designated as "Mrs. Rebeckah Sewall,"
and another child was written of as "Mrs. Sarah Gerrish, a
very beautiful and ingenious damsel seven years of age."

There were books of etiquette for children offering rules
for their guidance, among the things found in them being
the following:

"Never sit down at the table till asked, and after the
blessing. Ask for nothing; tarry till it be offered thee.
Speak not. Bite not thy bread but break it. Take salt only
with a clean knife. Dip not the meat in the same. Hold not
thy knife upright but sloping, and lay it down at right hand
of plate with blade on plate. Look not earnestly at any other
that is eating. When moderately satisfied leave the table.
Sing not, hum not, wriggle not. Spit no where in the room
but in the corner."

"Eat not too fast nor with Greedy Behavior. Eat not[Pg 383]
vastly but moderately. Make not a noise with thy Tongue,
Mouth, Lips, or Breath in Thy Eating and Drinking. Smell
not of thy Meat; nor put it to Thy Nose; turn it not to the
other side upward on Thy Plate."

"When any speak to thee, stand up. Say not I have heard
it before. Never endeavor to help him out if he tell it not
right. Snigger not; never question the Truth of it."308

Children were taught to be considerate of the old and
afflicted and to respect and honor their parents. This often
led to a stiff and formal manner as is shown in the following
letter written by a girl of eleven residing on Long Island:

"Ever Honored Grandfather;

Sir: My long absence from you and my dear Grandmother
has been not a little tedious to me. But what renders
me a Vast Deal of pleasure is Being intensely happy with a
Dear and Tender Mother-in-Law and frequent oppertunities
of hearing of your Health and Welfair which I pray God may
long Continue. What I have more to add is to acquaint you
that I have already made a Considerable Progress in Learning.
I have already gone through some Rules of Arithmetic,
and in a little Time shall be able of giving you a Better acct
of my Learning, and in the mean time I am Duty Bound to
subscribe myself

Your most obedient and
Duty full Granddaughter
Pegga Treadwell."309


Another little girl of eleven, in this same manner closes a
letter written at Boston in 1771 to her parents in Nova
Scotia:

"With Duty, Love       Compliments as due, perticularly to
my Dear little brother (I long to see him)       Mrs. Law, I
will write to her soon.

I am Hond Papa       mama,
Yr Dutiful Daughter
Anne Green Winslow."310

Yet withal there were boys in those old colonial days who
were as boys in all times and among all peoples. They played[Pg 384]
and shouted and raced in the streets and were reprimanded
by the authorities; they worried the poor night patrolman in
New Amsterdam by setting dogs on him and by getting behind
trees and fences and shouting out to him "The Indians!"
they made disorder in the churches of the Puritans
and were knocked on the head with the hard knob of the
long stick of the tithing-man; they robbed orchards, tore
down gates, frightened horses, and threw stones at dogs and
cats and at each other; they beat and kicked one another and
produced bloody noses; "worse yet, when the girls went forth
to gather 'daisies and butter-flowers,' the ungallant boys
kicked the girls 'to make them pipe.'"311


Diary of a Boston School Girl of 1771. Of the quaint and
delightful things that are preserved to us of those old days of
our country, to me there are none others more attractive than
the writings of a little Boston school girl, gathered up and
put in book form by Mrs. Alice Morse Earle.312 These
writings are the diary of Anna Green Winslow, who in 1770,
at the age of ten years, was sent from her home in Nova
Scotia to Boston, the birthplace of her parents, to "finish"
her education in the schools of that city. I shall not attempt
to analyze these writings, that is thoroughly done by
Mrs. Earle in her Foreword, but simply give a few extracts,
without comment, to show somewhat the thoughts and feelings
of a girl who lived in Boston during those stirring times,
1771-1773, and whose father was a paymaster in the English
army and loyal to his king.

In her Foreword Mrs. Earle tells of the condition of the
diary. "It covers seventy-two pages of paper about eight
inches long by six and a half inches wide. The writing is
uniform in size, every letter is perfectly formed; it is as legible
as print, and in the entire diary but three blots can be
seen, and these are very small. A few pages were ruled by
the writer, the others are unruled. The old paper, though
heavy and good, is yellow with age, and the water marks
C.      J. R. and the crown stand out distinctly. The sheets are
sewed in a little book, on which a marbled paper cover has
been placed, probably by a later hand than Anna's. Altogether
it is a remarkably creditable production for a girl of
twelve."

"My Aunt Deming says I shall make one pye myself at[Pg 385]
least. I hope somebody beside myself will like to eat a bit
of my Boston pye, thou' my papa and you did not (I remember)
chuse to partake of my Cumberland performance....
My aunt Deming gives her love to you and says it is
this morning 12 years ago since she had the pleasure of congratulating
papa and you on the birth of your scribling
daughter. She hopes if I live 12 years longer that I shall
write and do everything better than can be expected in the
past 12.... Dear mamma, you don't know the fation here       I
beg to look like other folk. You dont know what a stir
would be made in sudbury street, were I to make my appearance
there in my red Dominie       black Hatt.... My aunt
also says, that till I come out of an egregious fit of laughterre
that is apt to seize me       the violence of which I am at this
present under, neither English sense, nor anything rational
may be expected of me.... Elder Whitwell told my aunt,
that this winter began as did the Winter of 1740. How that
was I don't remember but this I know, that to-day is by far
the coldest we have had since I have been in New England.
(N.      B. All run that are abroad.) ... I began my shift at
12 o'clock last monday, have read my bible every day this
week       wrote every day save one.... Unkle is just come
in with a letter from Papa in his hand (      none for me) by
way of New bury. I am glad to hear that all was well the
26 Novr ult. I am told my Papa has not mention'd me
in this Letter. Out of sight, out of mind.... My cloak      
bonnet are really very handsome,       so they had need be. For
they cost an amasing sight of money, not quite £45 tho' Aunt
Suky said, that she suppos'd Aunt Deming would be frightened
out of her Wits at the money it cost. I have got one
covering, by the cost, that is genteel,       I like it much myself....
I heard Mr. Thacher preach our Lecture last evening
Heb. ii. 3. I remember a great deal of the sermon, but a'nt
time to put it down. It is one year last Sepr since he was ordain'd
      he will be 20 years of age next May if he lives so
long.... I have now the pleasure to give you the result, viz.,
a very genteel well regulated assembly which we had at Mr.
Soley's last evening, miss Soley being mistress of the ceremony.
We had two fiddles,       I had the honor to open the diversion
of the evening in a minuet with miss Soley. Our treat
was nuts, raisins, Cakes, Wine, punch, hot       cold, all in great
plenty. We had a very agreeable evening from 5 to 10 o 'clock.
For variety we woo'd a widow, hunted the whistle, threaded[Pg 386]
the needle,       while the company was collecting, we diverted
ourselves with the playing of pawns, no rudeness Mamma I assure
you.... Hond Mamma, My Hond Papa has never
signified to me his approbation of my journals, from whence
I infer, that he either never reads them, or does not give
himself the trouble to remember any of their contents, tho'
some part has been address'd to him, so, for the future, I shall
trouble only you with this part of my scribble.... My fingers
are not the only part of me that has suffer'd with sores
within this fortnight, for I have had an ugly great boil upon
my right hip       about a dozen small ones       I am at present
swath'd hip       thigh, as Samson smote the Philistines, but
my soreness is near over. I have read my bible to my aunt
this morning (as is the daily custom),       sometimes I read

because I may have the pleasure of hearing his voice, the
other because I don't understand his characters.... I went

but, N.      B. for herself she utterly disclames having either
her head or hand concern'd in this curious jurnal, except
where the writing makes it manifest. So much for this
matter."


Inheritance. "The leadership of the great families was
sustained in New York and in the colonies south of Pennsylvania
by primogeniture       the prerogative of the eldest son to
inherit the landed estate in case the father left no will. Custom
followed the law, and fathers who willed their property
usually left the most or all of the land to the oldest son, as
belonging to him by prescriptive right. This inequitable
practice had its use in the warlike ages of feudalism, when
the first son to grow up must take his father's place at the
head of his troop of dependents; but in the American colonies
it was only the result of that remarkable and often
stupid bondage to tradition in which the Anglo-Saxon peoples
contrive to exist and advance. To primogeniture the aristocratic
colonies added the dead hand of entail, by which the
land was sent down for generations in the line of the oldest
male. Even a clumsy fiction, called in law 'common recovery,'
by which the entail might be broken in England, was
forbidden by statute in Virginia, and was not accounted applicable
to the other colonies.

"The pilgrims at Plymouth and the Massachusetts Puritans
had belonged to that politico-religious party in England
which sought the abolition of certain old abuses. As
early as 1636 Plymouth enacted that land should be held
after 'the laudable custom, tenure, and hold of the manor of
East Greenwich,' that is, in an ancient Saxon way preserved
at the coming of William the Conqueror by the county of
Kent. One characteristic of this tenure was that it divided the
lands equally among the sons in case there was no will. Massachusetts,
which expressly abolished many of the worst features
of feudal tenure by name, gave to the oldest son a
double portion according to the Mosaic code, but divided the
rest among daughters as well as sons. This system prevailed
throughout New England. Primogeniture had come to be
esteemed a natural right, and the Massachusetts leaders felt
obliged more than once to defend themselves from the charge
of having 'denied the right of the oldest son.' Pennsylvania
took the same middle course of sheltering innovation under
the law of Moses by giving the oldest son a double portion.
The laws of some of the colonies made the land liable, to a[Pg 389]
greater or less extent, with personal estate for the debts of the
deceasd       which robbd the oldest of a part of his 'insolent
prerogative'; but it was not until the shock of the Revolution
that primogeniture and entail were swept away, under
the leadership of Jefferson and others. The oldest son's double
portion in New England survived the Revolution for some
years. A very ancient mode of inheritance prevailed in some
English boroughs, called among lawyers 'borough English.'
By this custom the lands descended to the youngest son. It
found no lodgment in the laws of the colonies, so far as I
know; but in New Hampshire it was a widespread custom to
leave the homestead to the youngest, who remained at home
and cared for the old age of his parents. This reasonable
form of the custom of 'ultimogeniture' lingers yet in certain
parts of the country, as, for example, in some of the northern
counties of New York."313


Sickness and Death. There was great mortality among the
early colonists and especially of children. There was nothing
in the way of sanitation, drainage was not considered necessary,
there was scarcely any disinfecting, and isolation in
contagious diseases was but poorly carried out. There were
various kinds of diseases, such as colds, fevers, malignant sore
throats, scurvy, rickets, fluxes, and many others, and contagious
diseases, smallpox having been very prevalent, almost
as pneumonia now, and being epidemic six times in a century.

In the earlier times the ministers took up medicine and
practiced healing as well as preaching, also compounding and
selling drugs to the people. Also other persons entered into
healing and selling medicines, as, innkeepers, magistrates,
grocers, and schoolmasters. There were, of course, plenty of
quacks and quack medicines. Even those who really practiced
medicine were not very well prepared. Such a person
did not prepare himself by long and arduous study in some
school of medicine, in fact there were none in the early days,
but he joined himself to an established physician to learn
the business from him. "He ground the powders, mixed the
pills, rode with the doctor on his rounds, held the basin when
the patient was bled, helped to adjust plasters, to sew wounds,
and ran with vials of medicine from one end of the town to
the other. In the moments snatched from duties such as these[Pg 390]
he swept out the office, cleaned the bottles and jars, wired
skeletons, tended the night-bell, and, when a feast was given,
stood in the hall to announce the guests."314 But even with
this little training he became a power for good in his community
for "Sunshine and rain, daylight and darkness, were
alike to him. He would ride ten miles on the darkest night,
over the worst of roads, in a pelting storm, to administer a
dose of calomel to an old woman, or to attend a child in a
fit. He was present at every birth; he attended every burial;
he sat with the minister at every death-bed, and put his name
with the lawyers to every will."315 The pay of the physicians
was often quite meager and "in many communities a bone-setter
had to be paid a salary by the town in order to keep
him, so few and slight were his private emoluments, even as
a physic-monger."316 There was the practice of midwifery in
those days and in New Amsterdam, at least, it was a much
respected calling.

Among a people who feared to use water as a constant
drink, as given under "Drink" in a foregoing part of this
chapter, it is not to be wondered at that water was denied
the patient tormented with fever, and clam-juice in small
quantities given instead. Bleeding and purging were resorted
to on every possible occasion. Salve was one of the
leading remedies and there were many different kinds used.
But the great remedies were those compounded and concocted
from the plants and the minerals and the animals that went
into the medical preparations of those times. They tried
about every weed and flower and most everything else to find
remedies and it did not seem to matter what the preparation
or the mixture was for they often went in as a jumble regardless
of the effect of one upon another. Earth-worms, snails,
toads, fishes, sowbugs, wood-lice, spiders, vipers, and adders
among the animal life were used; there was a great array of
plants, such as plantain, dandelion, dock, catnip, jimson-weed,
horehound, mint, garlic, elder, sage, saffron, tansy, and wormwood;
and of the mineral substances were quicksilver, verdigris,
brimstone, alum, and copperas. It did not seem to matter
greatly about the doses as there was no close exactness as
the quantity was given as "the bigth of a walnut," "enough
to lie on a pen knifes point," "the weight of a shilling,"[Pg 391]
"enough to cover a French crown," "as bigg as a haselnut,"
"take a little handful," "take a pretty quantity as often as
you please," and other similar lax directions.

There was scarcely an affliction for which there were not
several remedies. Here is a cure for insomnia:

"Bruise a handful of Anis-seeds, and steep them in Red
Rose Water,       make it up in little bags,       binde one of them
to each Nostrill, and it will cause sleep."317

For defective hearing is given the following:

"To Cure Deafness.       Take the Garden Daisie roots and
make juyce thereof, and lay the worst side of the head low
upon the bolster       drop three or four drops thereof into the
better Ear; this do three or four dayes together."318

For melancholy the following is "A pretious water to revive
the Spirits:"

"Take four gallons of strong Ale, five ounces of Aniseeds,
Liquorish scraped half a pound, Sweet Mints, Angelica,
Eccony, Cowslip flowers, Sage       Rosemary Flowers, sweet
Marjoram, of each three handfuls, Palitory of the VVal one
handful. After it is fermented two or three dayes, distil it
in a Limbeck, and in the water infuse one handful of the
flowers aforesaid, Cinnamon and Fennel-seed of each half an
ounce, Juniper berries bruised one dram, red Rosebuds,
roasted Apples       dates sliced and stoned, of each half a
pound; distil it again and sweeten it with some Sugarcandy,
and take of Amber-greese, Pearl, Red Coral, Hartshorn
pounded, and leaf Gold, of each half a Dram, put them in a
fine Linnen bag, and hang them by a thread in a Glasse."319

Perhaps next to the wonderful Snail-Water for rickets,
given on page 497 of this chapter, the Water of Life was the
great remedy, used for fevers and also as a tonic in health:

"Take Balm leaves and stalks, Betony leaves and flowers,
Rosemary, red sage, Taragon, Tormentil leaves, Rossolis and
Roses, Carnation, Hyssop, Thyme, red strings that grow upon
Savory, red Fennel leaves and root, red Mints, of each a
handful; bruise these hearbs and put them in a great earthen
pot,       pour on them enough White Wine as will cover them,
stop them close, and let them steep for eight or nine days;
then put to it Cinnamon, Ginger, Angelica-seeds, Cloves, and
Nuttmegs, of each an ounce, a little Saffron, Sugar one pound,[Pg 392]
Raysins solis stoned one pound, the loyns and legs of an old
Coney, a fleshy running Capon, the red flesh of the sinews of
a leg of Mutton, four young Chickens, twelve larks, the yolks
of twelve Eggs, a loaf of White-bread cut in sops, and two or
three ounces of Mithradate or Treacle,       as much Muscadine
as will cover them all. Distil al with a moderate fire, and
keep the first and second waters by themselves; and when
there comes no more by distilling put more Wine into the
pot upon the same stuffe and distil it again, and you shal
have another good water. This water strengtheneth the
Spirit, Brain, Heart, Liver, and Stomack. Take when need
is by itself, or with Ale, Beer, or Wine mingled with
Sugar."320

Small-pox was such a dreadful scourge to the colonists,
causing death, disfigurement, and misfortune, that after inoculation
was introduced and accepted as reliable, small-pox
hospitals arose and it became quite the fashion for entire
families and even parties made up of friends and acquaintances
to resort to them together and be inoculated all at the
same time, these parties being called classes. Sometimes
these gatherings were held at private homes and special invitations
were sent out to friends. "These brave classes took
their various purifying and sudorific medicines in cheerful
concert, were 'grafted' together, 'broke out' together, were
feverish together, sweat together, scaled off together, and
convalesced together. Not a very prepossessing conjoining
medium would inoculation appear to have been, but many a
pretty and sentimental love affair sprang up between mutually
'pock-fretten' New Englanders."321

The small-pox hospitals were of various kinds and prices,
ranging as low as three dollars per week for lodging, food,
medicine, care, and inoculation. The following advertisement
of one such hospital appeared in the Connecticut Courant of
November 30, 1767:

"Dr. Uriah Rogers, Jr., of Norwalk County of Fairfield
takes this method to acquaint the Publick       particularly such
as are desirous of taking the Small Pox by way of Inoculation,
that having had Considerable Experience in that Branch
of Practice and carried on the same the last season with great
Success; has lately erected a convenient Hospital for that
purpose just within the Jurisdiction Line of the Province of[Pg 393]
New York about nine miles distant from N.      Y. Harbour,
where he intends to carry said Branch of Practice from the
first of October next to the first of May next. And that all
such as are disposed to favour him with their Custom may depend
upon being well provided with all necessary accommodations,
Provisions       the best Attendance at the moderate Expense
of Four Pounds Lawful Money to Each Patient. That
after the first Sett or Class he purposes to give no Occasion for
waiting to go in Particular setts but to admit Parties singly,
just as it suits them. As he has another Good House provided
near Said Hospital where his family are to live, and
where all that come after the first Sett that go into the Hospital
are to remain with his Family until they are sufficiently
Prepared       Inoculated       Until it is apparent that they have
taken the infection."322

Upon a death in a town in New York state in colonial times,
notice was given by the ringing or tolling of the church-bell
and the funeral inviter was sent out, a man paid for his
services, who was dressed in gloomy black with long streamers
of crape hanging from his hat. The ones to be invited were
visited by him and notified of the day and hour of the funeral.
The funeral-inviter usually combined in himself along with
this office those of schoolmaster, bell-ringer, chorister, and
grave-digger. Later the funeral-inviter was made a public
officer and the fees were regulated by law. The corpse while
lying at the home was watched over through the night by
intimate friends of the family and these watchers were well
supplied with drinks and cakes and tobacco and pipes. The
body lay in state in a large room which was rarely used for
other occasions than this.

There were rare occurrences of night-burials in the colonies,
confined to people belonging to the English Church, the
funeral procession and burial taking place by torch-light. In
the earlier times in New England there were no religious
services of any kind at a funeral, neither at the house nor at
the grave, but later there were prayers at the house and a
short speech at the grave, and then funeral sermons began to
be preached but not at the time of the burial. In New York
there were funeral services but always held at the home. The
coffin was made of well-seasoned boards and covered with a
pall of fringed black cloth, which was replaced with a white
sheet where the death took place in childbirth. As a mark of[Pg 394]
mourning, in some places all ornaments and mirrors and
pictures were covered with cloths from the time of death till
after the funeral and even sometimes the window-shutters
at the front of the house were tied together with black cloth
and kept closed for a year. There were usually two sets of
pall-bearers, one set of strong young men who bore the coffin
on a bier and another set of older men of dignity, who
walked alongside the bearers and held the corners of the pall.
Much etiquette was displayed in arranging the order of the
procession to the grave, each mourner being carefully assigned
to his place, the widow usually being placed with a
magistrate or some other person of dignity.

Funerals became to be very expensive affairs and this
brought about legislative enactments trying to regulate and
curtail the expenses. When the cities began to grow and
wealth to increase much pomp and dignity were used in the
burial of men and women of high station, trumpets and
drums being used and volleys fired over the grave       even of
a woman. In properly putting away Governor Winthrop,
the chief founder of Massachusetts, a barrel and a half of
powder was consumed. In the middle and southern colonies,
the funeral became to be a time of feasting and drinking. At
a single funeral there might have been several barrels of wine
and several hogsheads of beer consumed, beside great quantities
of food eaten and tobacco used. Sometimes in Pennsylvania
as many as five hundred guests at a funeral were
served with punch and cake. At a funeral in Virginia the
cost of the wine used amounted to more than four thousand
pounds of tobacco. New England was not so far behind, as
bills are found for much baked meats, rum, cider, whiskey,
lemons, sugar, spices, and cakes used at funerals.

It was a custom in colonial times for the family of the deceased
to give certain kinds of gifts to those who were invited
to the funeral. Books were among the gifts, being serious
books suitable as a memorial of the occasion, but probably
book gifts occurred only in New England. Scarfs, often of
silk, were among the presents and also handkerchief, the
scarfs sometimes being worn quite awhile after the funeral
as a token of mourning, thereby showing respect for the dead.
Sometimes black ribbons were given, to be worn on the hat as
long streamers. Spoons also were given in New York, called
monkey-spoons, being made of silver with the figure or head
of an ape on the handle. The two most common and most[Pg 395]
important gifts were gloves and rings. The gloves were white
or black or purple and were of different quality, given according
to rank or closeness of blood to the deceased. Hundreds
of these gloves were often given out at a single funeral,
at one funeral over a thousand were given and still at another
three thousand pairs. A Boston clergyman kept account of
the number he had received and in thirty-two years he had
been given two thousand, nine hundred, and forty pairs of
mourning gloves. In 1738 at a funeral in Boston over two
hundred rings were given away. A judge received 57 mourning
rings between 1687-1725, a minister had a mugful, and a
physician who died in 1758 at the age of eighty-one left a
quart tankard full of the rings. "These mourning rings
were of gold, usually enameled in black, or black and white.
They were frequently decorated with a death's-head, or with
a coffin with a full-length skeleton lying in it, or with a
winged skull. Sometimes they held a framed lock of hair of
the deceased friend. Sometimes the ring was shaped like a
serpent with his tail in his mouth. Many bore a posy."323
These gloves and rings usually were sold. The Boston minister
noted above received between six and seven hundred dollars
through the sale of the gloves he had received at funerals
and likewise quite a good sum from the sale of the funeral
rings he had received.

There finally came a reaction against such great expense at
funerals and the giving of gifts so that by the middle of the
eighteenth century funerals were being held at which there
was little or no feasting and drinking and but little mourning
worn, and even some funerals were held at which no mourning
at all had been worn. In the latter part of the century laws
arose wherein fines were to be imposed on any person who
gave scarfs, gloves, rings, wine, or rum at a funeral, or who
bought any new mourning apparel except crape for an armband
if a man or a black bonnet, fan, gloves, and ribbon if a
woman. But such laws were difficult of being rigidly enforced
and so, perhaps, had but little effect, public opinion
and custom after all causing whatever changes that may have
come about.

It was a custom to fasten to the bier or platform supporting
the coffin verses and sentences laudatory to the deceased and
such often were printed after the funeral and distributed
among the relatives and friends. These prints were not only[Pg 396]
deeply bordered with black but "they were often decorated
gruesomely with skull and cross-bones, scythes, coffins, and
hour-glasses, all-seeing eyes with rakish squints, bow-legged
skeletons, and miserable little rosetted winding-sheets."324
When newspapers were established in the colonies it became
the practice to insert long and fulsome death-notices. Perhaps
the greatest display in writing about the dead was that
of the epitaph. They were of all kinds and quality many
quite amusing in both rhyme and thought, and yet there were
some epitaphs of beauty and sentiment that make us glad for
the efforts. The following is truly such a one:


"I came in the morning       it was Spring
And I smiled.
I walked out at noon       it was Summer
And I was glad.
I sat me down at even       it was Autumn
And I was sad.
I laid me down at night       it was Winter
And I slept."325


In New York interment was made under the church and
by special payment burial could be made under the very seat
the deceased was wont to occupy during life while upon attendance
at church. In New England the burial was in the
churchyard or it might, too, be made under the church and
this was true in the large places and of dignitaries. In the
smaller places the graveyard might have been located in a
barren pasture or on an out-of-the-way hillside. In the country
often each family had its own burying-place, sometimes
in a corner of the home farm and again at the foot of the
garden or orchard. The early gravestones were quite similar
in design. Freestone was used for these and rarely sandstone
on account of its being readily disintegrated by frosts and
storms. The best stone was a flinty slate-stone from North
Wales, which was imported from England ready carved, and
these stones also were alike, having at the top a winged
cherub's head. This remained the only emblem on stones till
near the middle of the eighteenth century when there began
to be used the weeping willow and urn.


The Illness of Children. As was given under Infancy, the
baby had to be baptized in the meeting-house on the first Sunday
following its birth, no matter what the conditions of the[Pg 397]
weather. This was surely as severe a test of the child's endurance
as that ever devised by any people, not excepting
the Spartans. Those that survived this baptism had to
undergo many malignant diseases, so that the mortality among
children was frightful and there was rarely if ever found a
family that could not count a number of deaths of the children,
often more died than reached maturity. The diseases
and climatic conditions were severe enough on the children
and the lack of sanitary caution added many children to the
death list, yet these were not all for the poor things had tried
out on them all kinds of nostrums and no doubt many died
from the dosings.

Among the medicines for children was Venice treacle, made
of vipers, white wine, opium, spices, licorice, red roses, tops
of germander, and St. John's-wort, with about twenty other
herbs, juice of rough sloes, and mixed with honey. Another
medicine for children contained forty-two ingredients. As
was given in another part of this chapter, rickets was one
of the greatest afflictions of children and as was noted, Snail
Water was one of the great remedies, for which see page 377.
Here is another remedy for rickets, and the child that survived
both the rickets and this treatment surely deserved to
live:

"In ye Rickets the best Corrective I have ever found is a
Syrup made of Black Cherrys. Thus. Take of Cherrys
(dry'd ones are as good as any)       put them into a vessel
with water. Set ye vessel near ye fire and let ye water be
Scalding hot. Then take ye Cherrys into a thin Cloth and
squeeze them into ye Vessell,       sweeten ye Liquor with
Melosses. Give 2 spoonfuls of this 2 or 3 times a day. If
you Dip your Child, Do it in this manner: viz: naked, in ye
morning, head foremost in Cold Water, don't dress it Immediately,
but let it be made warm in ye Cradle       sweat at
least half an Hour moderately. Do this 3 mornings going
      if one or both feet are Cold while other Parts sweat (which
is sometimes ye Case) Let a little blood be taken out of ye
feet ye 2nd Morning and yt will cause them to sweat afterwards.
Before ye dips of ye Child give it some Snakeroot and
Saffern Steep'd in Rum       Water, give this Immediately before
Dipping and after you have dipt ye Child 3 Mornings
Give it several times a Day ye following Syrup made of Comfry,
Hartshorn, Red Roses, Hogbrake roots, knot-grass, petty-moral
roots, sweeten ye Syrup with Melosses. Physicians are[Pg 398]
generally fearful about diping when ye Fever is hard, but
oftentimes all attemps to lower it without diping are vain.
Experience has taught me that these fears are groundless,
yt many have about diping in Rickety Fevers; I have found
in a multitude of Instances of diping is most effectual means
to break a Rickety Fever. These Directions are agreeable to
what I have practiced for many years."326

At the funeral of a boy there would sometimes be boys of
about the same age as the deceased to act as nominal pallbearers
to walk alongside the coffin borne by stronger young
men. When a young child or girl was buried, sometimes the
pall-bearers were girls, all dressed in white and wearing long
white veils.


Amusements. Many of the amusements of the old country
were brought into use by the colonists and there were
some that grew up in the surroundings of the new country.
There was a wide distinction between the New England
colonies and the other colonies in regard to such, as the Puritans
were much more sober in their bearing and really often
counted amusements as things to be avoided and even ungodly
and those of a hilarious nature were indulged in only by a
few of the less staid and solid citizens.

The really only regular diversion of the early colonists in
New England was the lecture-day, which usually occurred
weekly on Thursdays. These days were the occasion of a
lecture, usually religious, by the minister, and also there were
other doings, as, burning seditious books, publishing notices
of marriages, the holding of elections, the whipping of transgressors
at the whipping-post, the placing of offenders in the
stocks, bilboes, cage, or pillory, and criminals, too, were
hanged on these days. Another great day in the colonies was
muster-day when the militia came together for drill. This
became a time of merry-making as well as of military drilling
and amusements of various kinds were entered into. Another
time of gathering was at the fairs held in some of the middle
and southern colonies, at which were foot-races, sack-races,
wrestling, climbing greased poles, catching greased pigs, and
the like.

As the cities grew, the people would strive to get out for a
time in the country, so that inns and gardens grew up in the
suburbs and were much frequented. These gardens were
sometimes small and of a private nature and again they were[Pg 399]
large and not only furnished the guests with food and drink
but also with concerts and other entertainments. Clubs were
quite numerous in those days, usually consisting of a number
of men who had a weekly meeting at a tavern. These clubs
often consisted of people of the same nationality, as, the Irish
Club, the French Club, and so on. They had their patron
saints on whose birthdays they would hold great festivals, the
English having St. George, the Welsh St. David, the Irish
St. Patrick, and the young Americans of New York, not to
be outdone, "canonized, by their own authority, King Tammany,
a Delaware chief long dead, and celebrated his feast
on the old English May-day, which they ushered in with bell-ringings,
as though it were a veritable saint's day."327
There grew up in the cities gatherings of men and women,
called "Assemblies," for the purpose of dancing, card-playing,
and other social amusements. These were brilliant affairs,
wherein both men and women were richly dressed, and
where there was eating and drinking, great quantities of wine
often being consumed.

The colonists were very fond of dancing. "From the most
eastern forest settlements of Maine to the southern frontier
of Georgia, people in town, village, and country were everywhere
indefatigably fond of dancing ... the launching
of a ship, the raising of a house, the assembling of a county
court, and the ordination of a minister were good occasions
for dancing."328 They usually danced to the tune of a fiddle
but if there was no fiddle that would not keep them from it
as they would dance to some one's humming the tune. Dancing-schools
arose and although they were forbidden in New
England the young people learned to dance anyway. Dances
sometimes began at six o'clock in the evening and lasted till
three in the morning. "President Washington and Mrs. General
Greene 'danced upwards of three hours without once sitting
down,' and General Greene called this diversion of the
august Father of His Country, 'a pretty little frisk.'"329
This may be accounted for from the fact that the lady was
usually assigned to her partner for the entire evening, with
whom she did the greater part of her dancing.

Music was loved by the colonists throughout the entire colonial
period. Yet in early New England there was really[Pg 400]
little that could properly be called music, for in the church
there was only the droning out of the Psalms and often these
were not sung by all the congregation in the same tune at the
same time, making a most inharmonious medley. The first
music-book appeared in 1712. The early instruments for accompanying
the voice were the spinet and the harpsichord, the
first organ in Boston was about 1711.

Mrs. Earle states that though after 1760 concerts were frequent
yet the earliest advertisement she had found of a concert
was in the New England Weekly Journal of December
15, 1732:

"This is to inform the Publick That there will be a Consort
of Music Perform'd by Sundry Instruments at the Court
Room in Wings Lane near the Town Dock on the 28th of this
Instant December; Tickets will be deliver'd at the Place of
Performance at Five Shillings each Ticket. N.      B. No Person
will be admitted after Six."330

Because of the need of better music, there arose the "singing-school,"
a most happy form of amusement for the young
people of the colonial days in New England where there was
often but little chance for such. The singing-school teacher
was a great man and when he made his appearance that other
notable, the village school-master, had to take a back-seat for
the time being, for this man was a "professional," who was
to be paid and who paid his own bills and did not have to
"board round." The singing-school gave agreeable occasion
for the young people to spend a few of the long winter evenings
together and for sleighing-parties to be made up to go to
them, and where every girl, no matter how she got there, was
sure of an escort home.

Card-playing and gambling were almost universal. Ladies
gambled as well as gentlemen. Stakes often were high, sometimes
large estates were lost in a short time by reckless betting
at cards. "The ladies of New York were considered virtuous
above many others of their sex because of the moderation of
their gambling."331 Although the New Englanders were very
much opposed to cards and tried to stop their sale and use,
yet they highly approved another form of gambling, the lottery.
For a half century and longer the lottery was the greatest
amusement of New England, it was sanctioned and participated
in by all, the most esteemed citizens bought and sold[Pg 401]
tickets, and it was used as a scheme for raising funds for every
purpose       colleges increased their endowments, towns and
states raised money to pay their debts, and churches had lotteries
"for promoting public worship and the advancement of
religion." Not only were lotteries used to raise funds for
public affairs but there were also private lotteries in great
number and all kinds of prizes given, among such being furniture,
clothing, real estate, jewelry, and books. "New England
clergymen seemed specially to delight in this gambling excitement."332

As there was an abundance of wild game and fish, hunting
and fishing were great sports among the colonists.

Deer were hunted in various ways. Sometimes the hunter,
as learned from the Indians, covered himself in a deer skin
and was thus enabled to get near the deer to shoot them;
again a tree was felled and the hunter hid in the branches and
shot the deer while browsing upon the twigs; at night the deer
was approached by some one bearing a lighted torch and the
hunter would shoot the dazed animal looking into the light, or
the hunter would have a blazing fire in his canoe and float
toward the deer and shoot it; also deer were run down by
dogs and men on horseback. Wolves were caught on mackerel
hooks bound together in a bunch and dipped in tallow; they
were caught in iron traps; and they were caught in pits in
the earth hidden by light coverings to let them fall through.
Bears were caught in traps and pits and also hunted with
dogs trained for the purpose. There was fox-chasing on horseback;
sometimes on a moonlight night a sledge-load of cod-fish
heads was left by a fence or wall where the moon shone
brightly on it, and the foxes were shot as they came up to get
the heads of the fishes. Squirrels were killed for sport and
also because they consumed so much of the grain; sometimes
two groups of hunters matched one another and then counted
squirrel-scalps at night to see which party had killed the most
squirrels during the day. Wild turkeys were trapped and
killed with guns; sometimes fires would be built near their
roosting-places and then they could be shot while bewildered
from the light. Wild pigeons were taken in nets, by shooting
with guns, and while on their roosts at night, they were
knocked off with clubs, being so thickly together and thus
unable to get away. Also other wild game was hunted, as,
geese, ducks, grouse, partridges, and others.[Pg 402]

One way of taking wild game was by a "drive." A ring of
men would encircle a large tract of country and draw inward
toward a center, and thus drive in deer, bears, wolves, turkeys,
and other game, and as the animals made effort to escape
the men would shoot them. Another way of hunting was by
a fire-ring. A body of men would encircle a tract of land
and then set fire to the leaves, which would burn in toward
the center and then the men would shoot the animals as they
would try to break through the fire-ring and would thus be
brought to view.

Fishing was carried on in various ways. One of the most
common ways was with nets, which were of various kinds.
Weirs were also used, probably learned from the Indians and
improved upon by the colonists. Long lines were staked out
in a river and on it were placed short lines with hooks for
catching the fish. Fish were speared with a harping-iron or
gig. Where the fish were very plentiful men could ride into
the water at night and spear the fish with gigs by torch light.
They also went to the falls of the rivers and caught the shad
and salmon as they were ascending the river to spawn. Fish
also were caught with hook and line, but in the earlier times
when they were so abundant this was considered too slow a
process.

In winter the favorite amusement in New York was riding
in sleighs and this was true also in Philadelphia. In the
bitter climate of New England sleighing as a pastime was not
entered into by the colonists in the early days. The Dutch
in New York also indulged a great deal in skating, the ponds,
marshes, and watered meadows on Manhattan Island offering
plenty of ice for the sport. Sometimes provisions were carried
into New York on the back of marketmen on skates.

In a new country full of wild animals and wild men, it becomes
necessary for the settler to learn to use the gun as a
means of livelihood and of defense and so the settlers became
fine marksmen. Because of their learning to shoot well there
arose contests in marksmanship. This consisted often in
shooting at a mark for a prize, a silk handkerchief or such
like. Also there were matches where a turkey was put up as
a prize to be shot at, it might be a holiday was spent in a
shooting-match. Sometimes a beef was divided among competitors,
when a target would be put up and the one hitting
the center or nearest to the center would receive the best cut[Pg 403]
of the beef and it would thus be distributed according to the
shots ranging from the center.

A leading amusement of the colonists was horse-racing.
It is possible that horse-racing began in Virginia as soon as
there were horses in the colony to race. In 1665 the Governor
of New York announced a horse-race to encourage the bettering
of the breed of horses. The sport came late into New
England and yet there were races and notices of challenges to
race horses. The main centers of horse-racing were in the
vicinity of New York, Annapolis, Williamsburg, and Charleston,
and, later, at Philadelphia, also. There were two kinds
of races. The first was a great, formal affair, drawing a large
crowd, where the horses ran on a circular mile track, four
rounds to a heat, best two out of three to win. This race
required great endurance of the horses. The second kind of
race was a more informal affair, where the race was for a
quarter of a mile, for which race horses were bred to run for
a short distance at a very high rate of speed. Before the expiration
of the colonial period, there, too, arose the special
forms of the trotting-match and the pacing-match.

Cock-fighting was another sport of the colonists, which was
most popular in New York and the colonies south of it, its
chief centers being in Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina.
Men would go fifty miles to see a main, and choice
gamecocks were imported from England. There was, too,
bull-baiting and sometimes wolves and bears were captured
alive and used for baiting with dogs. Sometimes a live wolf
was tied to a horse's tail and dragged to death.

There were contests in running, leaping, wrestling, cudgeling,
stool-ball, nine-pins, quoits, fencing, and back-sword or
single-stick.

The people of the colonies did not have great opportunities
for amusement in the way of shows and so they turned readily
to any kind of exhibit and it did not require much display
to attract them. This being true, there came to be displays
of various kinds in plenty.

There were sleight-of-hand performances, acrobatic and
contortionistic displays, tight and slack rope performances,
and a kind of sword-dancing. Museums were founded in
which there were shown wax figures and other curiosities; a
mermaid was put on display; there were exhibits at various
times of a solar microscope, camera obscuras, moving pictures[Pg 404]
showing windmills and water-mills in motion and ships sailing,
electrical machines, a musical clock, puppets representing
Joseph's dream, and prospects of London and of royal
palaces. Among animals displayed, there were a lion drawn
about on a cart by four oxen, a wonderful creature called a
Sea Lion, a leopard "strongly chayned," a moose, a white sea
bear, a camel, a cassowary "five feet high that swallows stones
as large as an egg," and even a rabbit was advertised among
"curious wild beasts." There was a big hog on display for
four pence a person, and a cat with "one head, eight legs, and
two tails."

The most remarkable animal of all exhibited must have been
the one described in an advertisement in the Boston Gazette
of April 20, 1741:

"To be seen at the Greyhound Tavern in Roxbury a wild
creature which was caught in the woods about 80 miles to the
Westward of this place called a Cattamount. It has a tail
like a Lyon, its legs are like Bears, its Claws like an Eagle,
its Eyes like a Tyger. He is exceedingly ravenous and devours
all sorts of Creatures that he can come near. Its
agility is surprising. It will leap 30 feet at one jump notwithstanding
it is but 3 months old. Whoever wishes to see
this creature may come to the place aforesaid paying one shilling
each shall be welcome for their money."333

"Salem had the pleasure of viewing a 'Sapient Dog' who
could light lamps, spell, read print or writing, tell the time
of day, or day of the month. He could distinguish colors, was
a good arithmetician, could discharge a loaded cannon, tell
a hidden card in a pack, and jump through a hoop. About
the same time was exhibited in the same town a 'Pig of
Knowledge' who had precisely the same accomplishments."334

The first approach toward a theatrical entertainment seems
to have been at Philadelphia in 1724, where was given acrobatic
displays, rope-walking feats, and the like, which ended
up with a half-acrobatic, half-dramatic performance of a comical
character. Such entertainments must have followed in
other cities. There was a theatrical troupe, a sorry lot, in
Philadelphia in 1749, which went to New York in 1750, and
probably was the same that produced a play in a Boston coffee-house
that caused such a stir as to bring about legislation[Pg 405]
that kept the drama out of Boston for the remainder of the
colonial period. Although at this time there may not have
been any dramatic plays given, there was a custom in Virginia
at country houses to have the reading aloud of plays,
romances, and operas on rainy days, Sunday afternoons, and
when there might not have been dancing of an evening because
no fiddler could be secured for the music, and, later, after the
introduction of the drama into the colonies amateur companies
were organized to give plays.

The first real theatrical company in the colonies was in
1752, which troupe, twelve in number, came over from England.
Their opening play was given at Williamsburg, at that
time the capital of Virginia. This place was probably chosen
for the beginning of the theatrical work in the colonies "because
the inhabitants of Virginia were known to be rich, leisurely,
and society-loving people, with enough of refinement to
enjoy plays, and with few religious scruples against anything
that tended to make life pleasant to the upper classes."335

"Twenty-four plays had been selected and cast before
Lewis Hallam and his company left London on the 'Charming
Sally,' no doubt a tobacco-ship returning light for a cargo.
On her unsteady deck, day after day, during the long voyage,
the actors diligently rehearsed the plays with which they
proposed to cheer the hearts of people in the New World.
Williamsburg must have proved a disappointment to them.
There were not more than a thousand people, white and black,
in the village. The buildings, except the capitol, the college,
and the so-called 'palace' of the governor, were insignificant,
and there were only about a dozen 'gentlemen's' families resident
in the place. In the outskirts of the town a warehouse
was fitted up for a theater. The woods were all about it, and
the actors could shoot squirrels from the windows. When the
time arrived for the opening of the theater, the company were
much disheartened. It seemed during the long still hours of
the day that they had come on a fool's errand to act dramas
in the woods. But as evening drew on, the whole scene
changed like a work of magic. The roads leading into Williamsburg
were thronged with out-of-date vehicles of every
sort, driven by negroes and filled with gayly dressed ladies,
whose gallants rode on horseback alongside. The treasury
was replenished, the theater was crowded, and Shakspere[Pg 406]
was acted on the continent probably for the first time by a
trained and competent company. The 'Merchant of Venice'
and Garrick's farce of 'Lethe' were played; and at the close
the actors found themselves surrounded by groups of planters
congratulating them, and after the Virginia fashion offering
them the hospitality of their houses."336

This troupe finished the season at Williamsburg and then
went to Annapolis and throughout Maryland and reached
New York in 1753 and later went to Philadelphia. They made
a trip to the West Indies and on their return to New York
in 1758 they had difficulty in getting permission to play as a
great religious wave had swept over the country and there was
a strong feeling against such amusements. The troupe managed
to overcome this opposition and continued in the colonies
till the Revolutionary troubles arose. In 1774 the Continental
Congress voiced the sentiment of the people in asking
that there be a discontinuance of such sports and entertainments
as would tend to distract thought and feeling from the
getting ready of the colonies to defend their rights, and when
the head of the American company, as the troupe was called,
received this resolution from the president of the Congress,
the work of the company was stopped and the actors sailed for
the West Indies and that ended the drama in the colonies.

At the opening play by the English company at Williamsburg
in 1752, the music was that of the harpsichord and
furnished by the local music-master, and when they reached
New York they procured a violinist. The theaters built at
this time were little more than enclosed sheds and they were
usually painted red. The scenery was quite indifferent. The
seats were classified into boxes, pit, and gallery. The people in
the pit were allowed to use liquors and smoking was permitted
anywhere in the theater. Plays began at six o'clock in the
evening and servants and slaves were sent early beforetimes
to hold seats for their masters and mistresses. "Gentlemen
made free to go behind the scenes, and to loiter in full view
on the stage, showing their gallantry by disturbing attentions
to the actresses."337 which "proved so deleterious to
any good representation of the play, that the manager advertised
in 'Gaines' Mercury,' in 1762, that no spectators would
be permitted to stand or sit on the stage during the[Pg 407]
performance. And also a reproof was printed to 'the person
so very rude as to throw Eggs from the Gallery upon the
stage, to the injury of Cloaths.'"338


Games and Sports of Children and Young People. Children
played games and engaged in sports during the colonial
times in the United States and many of these games were the
same as were played in the home countries from whence their
ancestors came and they are played today by their descendants.
They were tormented, too, in their play, just as children
always are, by adults in power, as shown by the following
order issued in New York in 1673. "If any children be
caught on the street playing, racing, and shouting previous to
the termination of the last preaching, the officers of justice
may take their hat or upper garment, which shall not be
restored to the parents until they have paid a fine of two
guilders."339 The Puritan boys, too, had laws passed against
one of their games that cannot be played without somebody
getting hurt and hence the foolishness of such a law as was
made in Boston in 1657. "Forasmuch as sundry complaints
are made that several persons have received hurt by boys and
young men playing at football in the streets, these therefore
are to enjoin that none be found at that game in any of the
streets, lanes or enclosures of this town under the penalty of
twenty shillings for every such offence."340

But such laws as given above did not altogether crush the
spirits of the boys for, as stated before, one man whose duties
were to patrol New Amsterdam at night found they were
active enough, for he complained that the boys set dogs on him,
hid behind trees and fences and shouted out as he came by
"Indians!" and played other tricks on him. Even as much as
the Puritans tried to depress the spirits of their children, yet
we find one of them noting in his diary of his grandson: "In
the morning I dehorted Sam Hirst and Grindall Rawson from
playing Idle tricks because 'twas first of April: They were the
greatest fools that did so."341 And this same boy was so
wrought up with play when he was six years older as to
cause his grandfather to write: "Sam Hirst got up betime in
the morning, and took Ben Swett with him and went into the[Pg 408]
Comon to play Wicket. Went before anybody was up, left
the door open: Sam came not to prayer at which I was much
displeased."342

These children played the old historic game of cat's-cradle
and passed it on to the children of today, a game that is found
in many lands and among both civilized and uncivilized
peoples.343 They played hop scotch and tag of various kinds
and London Bridge and honey-pots, and many, many others,
as given in the paragraph below. They enjoyed singing games,
of which they had quite a number.

"In a quaint little book called The Pretty Little Pocket Book,
published in America at Revolutionary times, is a list of boys'
games with dingy pictures showing how the games were
played; the names given were chuck-farthing; kite-flying;
dancing round May-pole; marbles; hoop and hide; thread
the needle; fishing; blindman's buff; shuttlecock; king and I;
peg-farthing; knock out and span; hop, skip, and jump; boys
and girls come out to play; I sent a letter to my love; cricket;
stool-ball; base-ball; trap-ball; swimming; tip-cat; train-banding;
fives; leap-frog; bird-nesting; hop-hat; shooting;
hop-scotch; squares; riding; rosemary tree. The descriptions
of the games are given in rhyme, and to each attached a moral
lesson in verse."344 The following is a good illustration:



"MARBLES
"Knuckle down to your Taw.
Aim well, shoot away.
Keep out of the Ring,
You'll soon learn to Play.


"MORAL
"Time rolls like a Marble,
And drives every State.
Then improve each Moment,
Before its too late."345



A lady writing of a custom that prevailed at Albany about
the middle of the eighteenth century, during her childhood
there, writes as follows:

"The children of the town were divided into companies, as
they called them, from five to six years of age, until they[Pg 409]
became marriageable. How those companies first originated,
or what were their exact regulations, I cannot say; though I,
belonging to none, occasionally mixed with several, yet always
as a stranger, notwithstanding that I spoke their current language
fluently. Every company contained as many boys as
girls. But I do not know that there was any limited number;
only this I recollect, that a boy and girl of each company,
who were older, cleverer, or had some other pre-eminence
among the rest, were called heads of the company, and as such
were obeyed by the others.... Children of different ages in
the same family belonged to different companies. Each company
at a certain time of the year went in a body to gather
a particular kind of berries to the hill. It was a sort of annual
festival attended with religious punctuality. Every company
had a uniform for this purpose; that is to say, very
pretty light baskets made by the Indians, with lids and handles,
which hung over one arm, and were adorned with
various colors. Every child was permitted to entertain the
whole company on its birthday, and once besides, during
winter and spring. The master and mistress of the family
always were bound to go from home on these occasions, while
some old domestic was left to attend and watch over them,
with an ample provision of tea, chocolate, preserved and
dried fruits, nuts and cakes of various kinds, to which was
added cider or a syllabub; for these young friends met at
four and amused themselves with the utmost gayety and
freedom in any way their fancy dictated."346

"In spring, eight or ten of the young people of one company,
or related to each other, young men and maidens,
would set out together in a canoe on a kind of rural excursion,
of which amusement was the object. Yet so fixed were
their habits of industry that they never failed to carry their
work-baskets with them, not as a form, but as an ingredient
necessarily mixed with their pleasures. They had no attendants,
and steered a devious course of four, five, or perhaps
more miles, till they arrived at some of the beautiful islands
with which this fine river abounded, or at some sequestered
spot on its banks, where delicious wild fruits, or particular
conveniences for fishing afforded some attraction. There
they generally arrived by nine or ten o'clock, having set out
in the cool and early hour of sunrise.... A basket with
tea, sugar, and the other usual provisions for breakfast, with[Pg 410]
the apparatus for cooking it; a little rum and fruit for making
cool weak punch, the usual beverage in the middle of the
day, and now and then some cold pastry, was the sole provision;
for the great affair was to depend on the sole exertions
of the boys in procuring fish, wild ducks, etc., for the
dinner. They were all, like Indians, ready and dexterous
with the axe, gun, etc. Whenever they arrived at their destination,
they sought out a dry and beautiful spot opposite
to the river, and in an instant with their axes cleared so
much superfluous shade or shrubbery as left a semi-circular
opening, above which they bent and twined the boughs, so
as to form a pleasant bower, while the girls gathered dried
branches, to which one of the youths soon set fire with gunpowder,
and the breakfast, a very regular and cheerful one,
occupied an hour or two. The young men then set out to fish,
or perhaps to shoot birds, and the maidens sat busily down to
their work. After the sultry hours had been thus employed,
the boys brought their tribute from the river or the wood,
and found a rural meal prepared by their fair companions,
among whom were generally their sisters and the chosen of
their hearts. After dinner they all set out together to gather
wild strawberries, or whatever other fruit was in season; for
it was accounted a reflection to come home empty-handed.
When wearied of this amusement, they either drank tea in
their bower, or, returning, landed at some friend's on the
way, to partake of that refreshment."347

When we come to water sports there is found more hectoring
of the boys by the lawmakers. The Puritan lawgivers
passed laws against swimming and each tithing-man had ten
families under his charge to keep the boys from swimming in
the water, but it is guessed that the boys swam all the same.
Strange to say the boys were not debarred from the opposite
winter sport       that of skating, nevertheless there were
many deaths from breaking through the ice and drowning.

"Skating is an ancient pastime. As early as the thirteenth
century Fitzstephen tells of young Londoners fastening
the leg-bones of animals to the soles of the feet, and then
pushing themselves on the ice by means of poles shod with
sharp iron points.... Wooden skates shod with iron runners
were invented in the Low Countries. Dutch children in
New Netherlands all skated, just as their grandfathers had
in old Batavia. The first skates that William Livingstone[Pg 411]
(born in 1723) had on the frozen Hudson were made of beef
bones, as were those of medieval children."348

There might be some excuse made for the Puritans trying
to keep their boys from swimming because of their great fear
of the use of water, both internally and externally, but how
can the legislators of Albany be excused for the following
cruel law!

"Whereas ye children of ye sd city do very unorderly to
ye shame and scandall of their parents ryde down ye hills
in ye streets of the sd city with small and great slees on the
Lord day and in the week by which many accidents may
come, now for pventing ye same it is hereby published and
declared ye shall be and may be lawful for any Constable in
this City or any other person or persons to take any slee or
slees from all and every such boys and girls rydeing or
offering to ryde down any hill within ye sd city and breake
any slee or slees in pieces. Given under our hands and seals
in Albany ye 22th of December in 12th year of Her Maj's
reign Anno Domini 1713."349

By 1765 it would seem that legislation in Albany against
coasting had been abandoned or else the coasting was done
at night-time when travel had ceased. This passage below
is by the same woman, writing of about the year 1765, who
is quoted above in regard to the companies of children and
young people of Albany.

"In town all the boys were extravagantly fond of a diversion
that to us would appear a very odd and childish one.
The great street of the town sloped down from the hill on
which the fort stood, towards the river; between the buildings
was an unpaved carriage-road, the foot-path beside the
houses being the only part of the street which was paved.
In winter the sloping descent, continued for more than a
quarter of a mile, acquired firmness from the frost, and
became very slippery. Then the amusement commenced.
Every boy and youth in town, from eight to eighteen, had a
little low sledge, made with a rope like a bridle to the front,
by which it could be dragged after one by the hand. On this
one or two at most could sit, and this sloping descent being
made as smooth as a looking-glass, by sliders' sledges, etc.,
perhaps a hundred at once set out from the top of this
street, each seated in his little sledge with the rope in his[Pg 412]
hand, which, drawn to the right or left, served to guide him.
He pushed it off with a little stick, as one would launch a
boat; and then, with the most astonishing velocity, precipitated
by the weight of the owner, the little machine glided
past, and was at the lower end of the street in an instant.
What could be so delightful in this rapid and smooth descent
I could never discover; though in a more retired place, and
on a smaller scale, I have tried the amusement; but to a
young Albanian, sleighing, as he called it, was one of the
first joys of life, though attended by the drawback of walking
to the top of the declivity, dragging his sledge every time
he renewed his flight, for such it might well be called. In
the managing this little machine some dexterity was necessary;
an unskilful Phaeton was sure to fall. The conveyance
was so low that a fall was attended with little danger,
yet with much disgrace, for an universal laugh from all sides
assailed the fallen charioteer. This laugh was from a very
full chorus, for the constant and rapid succession of this
procession, where every one had a brother, lover, or kinsman,
brought all the young people in town to the porticos,
where they used to sit wrapt in furs till ten or eleven at
night, engrossed by this delectable spectacle. I have known
an Albanian, after residing some years in Britain, and becoming
a polished fine gentleman, join the sport and slide
down with the rest."350


Children's Toys and Story Books. Toys must have been
quite scarce in the earlier colonial days, probably very few
beyond what the children or parents made, and rather crude.
Even as late as 1695 a man in Massachusetts wrote to his
brother in England that if toys in small quantities were sent
to the colonies they would sell. Some years later toys increased
in number and toy-shops arose, there being one in
Boston in 1743. It is certainly hard to understand why marbles
should not have been advertised for sale at an earlier
time than the date given in the following: "Not until October,
1771, on the lists of the Boston shopkeepers, who seemed
to advertise and to sell every known article of dry goods,
hardware, house furnishing, ornament, dress, and food, came
that single but pleasure-filled item 'Boys Marbles.'"351

There were not a great variety of toys used in the colonies.
Tin toys were quite scarce as tin was not much in[Pg 413]
use at that time for such purposes. There were kites, hoops,
balls, battledore and shuttles, tops, marbles, skates and
sleds. There were home-made hobby-horses, coaches, and
chariots. The boys had jack-knives and knew how to use
them in making pop-guns, whistles, windmills, water-wheels,
traps, and the like. Boys also made their own weapons, as,
clubs, slings, bows, and arrows. The girls had dolls, of
course, but they were home-made affairs for the greater part.
The only dolls advertised in the colonial papers were those
told about under dress, which were the models that were
dressed in Europe and sent over to mantua-makers to give
the styles. It is true that after serving this purpose the
dolls were sold for children's use and thought much of by
them. The furniture was much of it home-made, birch bark
being especially adaptable for the purpose. Wicker cradles
and chaises were made for the dolls, copied from those of
infants.

It would seem that there were absolutely no books specially
written for the pleasure of the children in the early
years of the colonial times, nor for that matter were there
any such written in England during the same period. There
were, however, to teach some truths, three books written that
were taken up by the children and who greatly loved to read
them, which were The Pilgrim's Progress in 1688, Robinson
Crusoe in 1714, and Gulliver's Travels in 1726. The beginning
of story books for children in England and America
was in 1744, when John Newberry began publishing such
books in London. His books were at once exported to
America and advertisements of them are found in the colonial
newspapers. One of these books, probably published
in 1744, was "The Pretty Little Pocket Book," one story
in which was "Jack the Giant Killer." Another book published
by Newberry about 1760 was "Mother Goose's Melodies."
After the Revolution, story books for children became
more common and they have kept increasing through
the years to the present.


Holidays and Festivals. The old English festivals were
not greatly observed by the colonists. In Puritan New England
there were few set times and days for pleasure. The
holy days of the English Church were not only disregarded
by the Puritans, but even laws were made forbidding their
public celebration, for while in England they had turned
away from the state church and they had learned to hate[Pg 414]
the excesses of the festivals. In the other colonies the demands
of the early years and the getting away from religious
influences may have brought about the decline of the celebration
of the church festivals, for even in Virginia, which
clung to the old church, the clergy complained that the
people only observed Christmas and Good Friday as they
did not want to stop work for other holidays.

Although Christmas was observed in the colonies outside
of New England, it was not with the old English fervor and
never with the great excesses, as stated by one of the old
Puritan divines as spent throughout England in "revelling,
dicing, carding, masking, mumming, consumed in compotations,
in interludes, in excess of wine, in mad mirth."352

New Year's Day was a great day for the Dutch in New
York and its observance was continued by the English when
they came into control. The Dutch inaugurated the custom
of New Year's calling, wherein the ladies kept open
house and were called upon by their gentleman friends.
Food and drink were served in generous quantities and before
the end of the day the gentlemen would often get quite
hilarious. The streets of the city would be filled with vehicles
loaded with callers going from house to house, a general
gala occasion. In the country towns of New York colony
the New Year was often ushered in by men with fire-arms
going from house to house and firing salutes. This was
kept up until a crowd was collected and then they would end
the day by firing at a mark.

If the Dutch of New York originated New Year's callings
the Puritans of New England originated Thanksgiving Day.
Just when each custom first began cannot be determined for
each must have arisen gradually and continued till the practice
became fixed. The thanksgiving days were not always at
first for giving thanks for God's beneficence, but for various
reasons, as, political events, the success of the Protestant
cause, victories over Indians, the safe arrival of ships with
friends and provisions, and so on. Nor were they set for
any special season or day, probably Thursday became fixed
because of its being the lecture day and autumn because of
the time of harvests thus making the days of thanksgiving
come more often at this season.

The first Thanksgiving was not a religious event nor a
single day, but a time of recreation as shown from the fol[Pg 415]lowing
written by one of the Puritans in Plymouth on December
11, 1621:

"Our harvest being gotten in, our governor sent four men
on fowling that so we might after a special manner rejoice
together after we had gathered the fruits of our labors.
They four killed as much fowl as with a little help beside
served the company about a week. At which times among
other recreations we exercised our arms, many of the Indians
coming amongst us, and among the rest their greatest king
Massasoyt with some ninety men, whom for three days we
entertained and feasted, and they went out and killed five
deer which they brought and bestow'd on our governor, and
upon the captains and others."353

The first public thanksgiving was held in Boston in 1630
to express thanks for the safe arrival of ships bringing
friends and food. From this on there were public thanksgivings,
but not every year, until it became a fixed annual
affair, but at just what time this occurred it would be impossible
to state. As it became a fixed custom, there grew
into it many of the features of the old English Christmas,
notwithstanding the attitude of the Puritans toward that
day, and it became a day of family reunions and of feasting
on turkey and Indian pudding and pumpkin pie.

"But Thanksgiving Day was not the chief New England
holiday. Ward, writing in 1699, does not name it, saying
of New Englanders: 'Election, Commencement, and Training
Days are their only Holy Days.'"354

Election Day was a kind of holiday and indeed sometimes
the whole week was included in the holiday. As was stated
before, Training Day was a day of coming together of the
people at which there was not only military drill but also
amusements of various kinds and sometimes the occasion
for a display of public punishment. Commencement Day
at the college was a proud day for the people whose sons
graduated and a kind of general holiday for all. There was
a dinner and plenty of wine. It would seem that this was
an occasion for which more than a day would be used, as
after 1730 Commencement Day was usually set for Friday
as there would not be so much of the week left for jollifying.

Shrove Tuesday was observed in New York by the middle
of the eighteenth century as a holiday given over to cocking-mains,[Pg 416]
as it was in England. Saint Valentine's Day was
observed by the Dutch in New Amsterdam as Women's Day
and it was celebrated by the young women, each of whom
armed herself with a heavy cord having a knot on the end
with which she struck every young man whom she would
meet. Guy Fawkes' Day was celebrated at least in New
England and New York, being the occasion for bonfires and
fantastic parades and burning an effigy of Guy Fawkes,
which often was only a straw carried by each one to cast
into the fire. In some of the colonies, May Day was celebrated
and a May-pole erected and some attempts were made
to celebrate it in New England but it did not get much
encouragement and it was but a feeble holiday there. Pinkster
Day, the name being derived from the Dutch word for
Pentecost, was a great holiday in New York for the negro
slaves. They gathered in great numbers on that day and
had singing and dancing and feasting and drinking       a general
good time. The spring sheep-shearing and the autumnal
corn-husking were a time of great gatherings and merry-makings,
and there were also apple-bees, maple-sugar stirrings,
and log-rollings.


Public Punishments. Another subject that could have well
been placed under amusements is that of public punishments,
for such did afford a means of amusement in the form
of ridiculing and reviling the ones exposed and of throwing
things at them, and, too, exposure was often on a holiday,
thus affording more time and opportunity for the people to
amuse themselves. Not only was the offender or criminal
exposed to the public view but this was made all the worse
by placing him in some kind of instrument that would cause
him to be in an attitude that would emphasize the grotesqueness
of the exposure and make the punishment all the
more insulting and painful. This public form of punishment
was not confined wholly to men for women, too, were
sometimes placed thus before the public.

The exposure of the culprit was not enough for the people
of those days and particularly in New England for the parson
must be given a chance to display his powers and so the
offender was often set in a public place in the church that
he might be prayed and preached over and which were too
often in the form of objurgations, and, further, this sermon
was sometimes printed and sold for it was among the parson's
greatest efforts.[Pg 417]

This was a time of cruelty toward all living creatures
whether beasts or men both in the old country and the new,
probably somewhat the effect of the heavy and habitual
indulgence in alcoholic drinks by all the people, thus deadening
to an extent the higher sensibilities. These public displays
must have hardened the people and in particular to
have accustomed the young to such and to view crime as
meriting open punishment without regard to the feelings
of the one exposed. Yet some of the young people must have
been affected in an opposite manner for there was a growing
away from this form of punishment and of cruelty and
which has continued down to the present time where the
welfare and individuality of the offender is being more and
more considered.

These people of the olden times very greatly feared ridicule,
especially of being called names, and hence the ways
of punishment were so devised as to place the culprit in a
ridiculous position and so that he could not resist the insults
inflicted upon him by his fellow-men. The colonists were
forever resisting insults by bringing suits in petty slander
and libel cases. Men in public positions were in particular
jealous of their power and official honor and resented and
punished affronts against themselves or their offices or their
public doings. Although all classes of people were greatly
affected by ridicule and slander, it would seem that schoolmasters
and parsons were the most active against such, as
is shown from the old court records.

One of the earliest of these instruments of punishment
was the bilboes. This consisted of shackles attached to a
heavy iron bolt or bar into which shackles the legs were
thrust and then locked in with a padlock. Sometimes there
was a chain on the end of the bar which was fastened to the
floor or it might have been to the wall or a post so that the
offender's legs were pulled up high to make his position the
more ridiculous and painful. The bilboes were not greatly
in use in the colonies and they were soon superseded by the
stocks and the pillory. The stocks were made of two heavy
timbers, one coming down on the other, with circular openings
in them for holding the legs of the culprit, and sometimes
also smaller openings for the arms. The upper timber
was raised, the legs of the culprit placed in the openings
and then kept tight by closing down the upper piece and
fastening it. The one in the stocks usually sat on a low[Pg 418]
bench. The pillory consisted of two pieces of timbers as
with the stocks and attached to two upright pieces at either
end at about the height of a man's shoulders. There were
three circular openings in the timbers, one for the neck and
two small ones for the wrists. The neck and arms were
placed in these openings and confined as the legs were in the
stocks, leaving the head and hands hanging out exposed, the
culprit standing.

The ducking stool was specially designed for scolding
women, though also used for other offenses. There were different
forms. The following description of one of these instruments
and its use is said to be from a letter giving an
account of a ducking in Virginia in 1634:

"The day afore yesterday at two of ye clock in ye afternoon
I saw this punishment given to one Betsy wife of
John Tucker who by ye violence of her tongue has made his
house and ye neighborhood uncomfortable. She was taken
to ye pond near where I am sojourning by ye officer who was
joined by ye Magistrate and ye Minister Mr. Cotton who had
frequently admonished her and a large number of People.
They had a machine for ye purpose yt belongs to ye parish,
and which I was so told had been so used three times this
Summer. It is a platform with 4 small rollers or wheels
and two upright posts between which works a Lever by a
Rope fastened to its shorter or heavier end. At ye end of ye
longer arm is fixed a stool upon which sd Betsey was fastened
by cords, her gown tied fast around her feete. The
Machine was then moved up to ye edge of ye pond, ye Rope
was slackened by ye officer and ye woman was allowed to go
down under ye water for ye space of half a minute. Betsey
had a stout stomach, and would not yield until she had
allowed herself to be ducked 5 several times. At length she
cried piteously, Let me go Let me go, by God's help I'll
sin no more. Then they drew back ye Machine, untied ye
Ropes and let her walk home in her wetted clothes a hopefully
penitent woman."355

The pillory itself was not sufficient punishment, for too
often the ears of the offender were nailed back to the wood
by his head and when the head was removed from the pillory
sometimes the nails were not pulled and the ears thus released
but the ears were split out of the nails. The cutting
off the ears of the offender was of rather frequent occurrence.[Pg 419]
The brank or scold's bridle, a kind of head-piece with a
spiked plate or flat tongue of iron to be placed in the mouth,
was a cruel instrument that seems not to have been used in
the colonies, as they used a cleft stick into which the tongue
was inserted. Another form of punishment was the placing
of a letter or inscription on the offender, sometimes the letter
was of a conspicuous color and sewed on to the garment in
a conspicuous place. The ears were not the only part to be
maimed, for the nostrils were slit and the cheeks and forehead
were gashed and the tongue was bored through with an
awl, or even with a hot iron. Branding with a hot iron
was a common enough form of punishment and to make it
the more striking it was often done on the forehead or the
cheek or on the hands.

Whipping became a common and frequent punishment
and it was used for a number of different kinds of offenses.
In New York in the time of Dutch control two of the most
common causes for whipping was drunkenness and theft.
In New England whipping was used as a punishment for
lying, swearing, taking false toll, perjury, selling rum to the
Indians, drunkenness, slander, name-calling, making false
love to a young woman in which a pretense of marriage was
used, and for other crimes. One of the greatest crimes in New
England was idleness and "transients" as they were called,
people who would not settle down and keep at steady work,
were often whipped from town to town, for they were not
allowed to remain anywhere very long. "So common were
whippings in the southern colonies at the date of settlement
of the country, that in Virginia even 'launderers and launderesses'
who 'dare to wash any uncleane Linen, drive bucks,
or throw out the open water or suds of fowle clothes in the
open streetes,' or who took pay for washing for a soldier or
laborer, or who gave old torn linen for good linen, were
severely whipped. Many other offenses were punished by
whipping in Virginia, such as slitting the ears of hogs, or
cutting off the ends of hog's ears       thereby removing ear-marks
and destroying claim to perambulatory property       stealing
tobacco, running away from home, drunkenness,
destruction of land-marks."356

Sometimes the offender was tied to the tail of a cart and
whipped through the streets, sometimes he was whipped at
the pillory, but most often the whipping-post was used.[Pg 420]
"There was a whipping-post on Queen Street in Boston,
another on the Common, another on State Street, and they
were constantly in use in Boston in Revolutionary times.
Samuel Breck wrote of the year 1771:

"'The large whipping-post painted red stood conspicuously
and prominently in the most public street in the town.
It was placed in State Street directly under the window of
a great writing school which I frequented, and from there
the scholars were indulged in the spectacle of all kinds of
punishment suited to harden their hearts and brutalize their
feelings.'"357

Women as well as men were whipped. Sometimes the
whipping was done in the jail-yard, sometimes at the whipping-post,
and sometimes even at the tail of a cart, this last
was a common enough form used on the Quaker women in
Massachusetts. The following would imply that sex did not
greatly appeal to the colonists. "In the 'Pticuler' Court of
Connecticut this entry appears: May 12, 1668.... Mary
Wilton, the wife of Nicholas Wilton, for contemptuous and
reproachful terms by her put on one of the Assistants are
adjudged she to be whipt 6 stripes upon the naked body next
training day at Windsor."358 "From a New York newspaper,
dated 1712, I learn that one woman at the whipping-post
'created much amusement by her resistance.'"359 Quoting
further from Samuel Breck about the whipping-post
in Boston in 1771: "Here women were taken in a huge cage
in which they were dragged on wheels from prison, and tied
to the post with bare backs on which thirty or forty lashes
were bestowed among the screams of the culprit and the
uproar of the mob."360 "In Virginia in 1664 Major Robbins
brought suit against one Mary Powell for 'scandalous
speaches' against Rev. Mr. Teackle, for which she was ordered
to receive twenty lashes on her bare shoulders and to
be banished the country."361

This gruesome story of public punishments may well be
ended with the most gruesome part of all, that of public
hangings. Far greater than the amusement afforded our old
colonial ancestors by witnessing the whipping or maiming[Pg 421]
or branding of offenders or even the getting to rail at them
set in stocks, bilboes, cage, or pillory, was the thrilling spectacle
of a public execution and which became all the greater
gala day if several persons were hanged together at the one
occasion. One of the greatest of these exhibitions occurred
at Boston on June 30, 1704, when seven pirates were executed.
"Sermons were preached in their Hearing Every
Day, And Prayers made daily with them. And they were
Catechized and they had many Occasional exhortations. Yet
as they led a wicked and vitious life so to appearance they
died very obdurately and impenitently hardened in their
sin."362 So ran the account in the News Letter in an "extra"
for the event. Of course such a noted happening could
not have escaped so good a chronicler as Judge Sewall for he
gave the following account of this hanging in his diary:

"After dinner about 3      p.      m. I went to see the Execution.
Many were the people that saw upon Broughtons Hill. But
when I came to see how the River was covered with People
I was amazed; Some say there were 100 boats. 150 Boats
      Canoes saith Cousin Moody of York. He Told them. Mr.
Cotton Mather came with Captain Quelch       6 others for
Execution from the Prison to Scarletts Wharf and from
thence in Boat to the place of Execution. When the Scaffold
was hoisted to a due height the seven Malefactors went up.
Mr. Mather pray'd for them standing upon the Boat. Ropes
were all fastened to the Gallows save King who was Reprieved.
When the Scaffold was let to sink there was such
a Screech of the Women that my wife heard it sitting in
our Entry next the Orchard and was much surprised at it,
yet the wind was sou-west. Our house is a full mile from the
place."363


Manufactures. The colonists were very busy people. This
was particularly true of the earlier times when nature had
to be conquered. They had to make a great many of
their own implements and to learn to use in a skillful manner
the few tools they had. They had to learn to adapt
the materials that nature furnished and to shape them into
forms best fitted for their work. They learned to select the
natural forms of things that could serve various purposes.
They had two tools, the ax and the knife, that were readily
and skillfully used in home manufacturing.[Pg 422]

The colonists cut and shaped the logs for their houses
and made stanchions and clapboards and shingles and laths.
They selected pieces of timber and trimmed them for snaths
for their scythes and flails, sled-runners and thills for carts,
hames and ox-yokes, stakes and poles for various uses, whip-stalks
and ax-handles, and handles for spades. They made
salt-mortars, hog troughs, maple-sap troughs, and similar
articles by burning and scraping out logs cut to the
lengths wanted. They made wooden hinges and door-latches
and buttons for fastening doors. They made spinning-wheels
and reels and looms and the things used with them.
They made various kinds of wooden bowls and trays and
spoons for household use. They learned from the Indians
how to make brooms by taking the length of a small birch
tree and slitting the lower end into a brush and shaping the
upper end into a handle; they also learned to make a broom
by tying about a handle hemlock branches together for the
brush. They made spoons from clam-shells set in split
sticks. They used gourd-shells for bowls and skimmers and
dipper and bottles and pumpkin-shells for seed and grain
holders. Turkey-wings were used for hearth-brushes. There
was one implement that the colonist in his frontier life spent
much time on and that was the powder-horn. "Months of
the patient work of every spare moment was spent in beautifying
them, and their quaintness, variety, and individuality
are a never-ceasing delight to the antiquary. Maps, plans,
legends, verses, portraits, landscapes, family history, crests,
dates of births, marriages and deaths, lists of battles, patriotic
and religious sentiments, all may be found on powder-horns.
They have in many cases proved valuable historical records,
and have sometimes been the only records of events."364


Boys' Work and Manufactures. It is not to be wondered
at that great men arose in the early history of our country,
for the young were so trained to work that the whole
physical being of the boy was cultivated, and so when a great
brain came there was a sound body in which to keep it and
help it. A boy's life on a farm is thus described by one
who went through it:

"The boy was taught that laziness was the worst form of
original sin. Hence he must rise early and make himself
useful before he went to school, must be diligent there in
study, and promptly home to do 'chores' at evening. His[Pg 423]
whole time out of school must be filled up with some service,
such as bringing in fuel for the day, cutting potatoes for
the sheep, feeding the swine, watering the horses, picking
the berries, gathering the vegetables, spooling the yarn. He
was expected never to be reluctant and not often tired."365

Not only did the boy have to work hard, but also, at
least in New England, he had to provide his own spending
money, and various were the ways he devised to obtain it.
The boy's jack-knife was a great instrument and highly
prized, for with it he not only made things for his own use
but also to sell to procure spending money. With knives
and mallets the boys split out shoe-pegs from maple sticks.
They made and set teeth in wool-cards. They made traps
and caught wild animals. They made birch splinter brooms.
One man stated in London during the middle of the eighteenth
century that when a boy in New Hampshire his
only spending money was earned by making these brooms
and carrying them on his back ten miles to town to sell
them. The boys whittled cheese-ladders and cheese-hoops
and butter-paddles for their mothers' use. They collected
the bristles from the hogs at hog-killing time and sold them
for brush-making. They gathered nuts and berries and wild
cherries, the cherries being used in making cherry-rum and
cherry-bounce. Tying onions was another means of money-making.
The older boys sometimes made staves and shingles.
Where a boy could turn a hand for making a little money
for himself he did it.


Girls' and Women's Work. In the colonial days everybody
worked and the girls and women did their share of it. The
following quotations well show this. In the last half of the
eighteenth century the qualifications of a housekeeper were
such as asked for in the following advertisement:

"Wanted at a Seat about half a day's journey from Philadelphia,
on which are good improvements and domestics, A
single Woman of unsullied Reputation, an affable, cheerful,
active and amiable Disposition; cleanly, industrious, perfectly
qualified to direct and manage the female Concerns
of country business, as raising small stock, dairying, marketing,
combing, carding, spinning, knitting, sewing, pickling,
preserving, etc., and occasionally to instruct two young
Ladies in those Branches of Oeconomy, who, with their
father, compose the Family. Such a person will be treated[Pg 424]
with respect and esteem, and meet with every encouragement
due to such a character."366

"There is, in the library of the Connecticut Historical
Society, a diary written by a young girl of Colchester, Connecticut,
in the year 1775. Her name was Abigail Foote.
She set down her daily work, and the entries run like this:

'Fix'd gown for Prude,       Mend Mother's Riding-hood,       Spun
short thread,       Fix'd two gowns for Welsh's girls,       Carded
tow,       Spun linen,       Worked on Cheese-basket,       Hatchel'd
flax with Hannah, we did 51 lbs. apiece,       Pleated
and ironed,       Read a Sermon of Doddridge's,       Spooled a
piece,       Milked the cows,       Spun linen, did 50 knots,       Made a
Broom of Guinea wheat straw,       Spun thread to whiten,       Set
a Red dye,       Had two Scholars from Mrs. Taylor's,       I
carded two pounds of whole wool and felt Nationly,       Spun
harness twine,       Scoured the pewter.'

"She tells also of washing, cooking, knitting, weeding the
garden, picking geese, etc., and many visits to her friends.
She dipped candles in the spring, and made soap in the
autumn."367

Knitting was an accomplishment of every girl in New
England and among the Dutch in New York and probably
with every other girl in all the colonies. Little girls were
taught to knit as soon as they could hold the needles, and at
four years of age they could knit stockings and mittens.
They knit in wool and silk, doing fine knitting with many intricate
and elaborate stitches. "A beautiful pair of long
silk stockings of open-work design has initials knit on the
instep, which were the wedding hose of a bride of the year
1760; and the silk for them was raised, wound, and spun
by the bride's sister, a girl of fourteen, who also did the
exquisite knitting."368

These colonial women were thrifty and saving, being well
prepared to care for the garments needing repair, as is
shown from an advertisement in the New York Gazette of
April 1, 1751:

"Elizabeth Boyd gives notice that she will as usual graft
Pieces in knit Jackets and Breeches not to be discern'd, also
to graft and foot Stockings, and Gentlemen's Gloves, mittens
or Muffatees made out of old Stockings, or runs them in[Pg 425]
the Heels. She likewise makes Children's Stockings out of
Old Ones."369

The one kind of work that all the colonial women reveled
in and which allowed them to display their love of color,
their skill in needle-craft, and their thrift in using up odds
and ends, was that of quilt-making. In the early days
cotton goods were scarce and so the quilts were made from
woolen garments and pieces, and all kinds of garments and
remnants were used, as, the old discarded militia uniforms,
worn-out flannel sheets, old petticoats, coat and cloak linings,
and any other things that could not be further worn. These
were thoroughly washed and where needed dyed with home-dyes
and then pressed out and cut into quilting pieces.
Later, cottons and linens were more readily procured and
often the very best stuffs were used, for they prided themselves
on the beauty of the pieces and their arrangement and
the careful stitching. Not only did the making of quilts afford
a chance to use up the material that could not be used otherwise
and thus make coverings of value and warmth, it also
gave to the women the opportunity for coming together and
enjoying themselves, and so quilting-bees became one of the
most social and enjoyable occasions.

One of the great industries of the women was that of
soap-making. The refuse grease from cooking, butcherings,
and the like, was stored up through the winter as was also
the wood-ashes from the fire-place for the spring soap-making.
From the ashes they obtained lye by pouring water
over the ashes in barrels set on boards with grooves in them
and letting it filter out at the bottom to be caught in vessels
set under the ends of the boards. The lye thus obtained
was poured over the grease in a great pot and boiled over a
fire out of doors. The soft soap thus made was used for
household purposes, especially in the washing of clothing,
which was done usually once a month and in some households
once in three months, the soiled clothing having been
allowed to accumulate and be stored away to be washed
together on one great wash-day. Another kind of labor in
which the women engaged was the picking of the domestic
geese, which were raised for the feathers rather than for
food. The feathers were greatly desired for pillows and
beds and the quills for pens.

Among the industries in which women engaged were those[Pg 426]
of flax-culture and spinning, wool-culture and spinning, and
hand-weaving. The women and children aided in the culture
of the flax and did quite a good deal of the work in its
preparation and almost all the spinning. Women and children,
too, did a great deal in helping in the wool-culture
and spinning and weaving. In those early days all in the
family could help and a family at work is well portrayed in
the following.

"The wool industry easily furnished home occupation to
an entire family. Often by the bright fire-light in the early
evening every member of the household might be seen at
work on the various stages of wool manufacture or some of
its necessary adjuncts, and varied and cheerful industrial
sounds fill the room. The old grandmother, at light and easy
work, is carding the wool into fleecy rolls, seated next the
fire; for, as the ballad says 'she was old and saw right
dimly.' The mother, stepping as lightly as one of her girls,
spins the rolls into woolen yarn on the great wheel. The
oldest daughter sits at the clock-reel, whose continuous buzz
and occasional click mingles with the humming rise and fall
of the wool-wheel, and the irritating scratch, scratch, of the
cards. A little girl at a small wheel is filling quills with
woolen yarn for the loom, not a skilled work; the irregular
sound shows her intermittent industry. The father is setting
fresh teeth in a wool-card, while the boys are whittling
hand-reels and loom-spools."370

After the first years in the new country, when all time
and labor would be consumed in carrying on the plain necessaries
of life, women began to enter more into fancy lines
of work, and during later colonial times the women and girls
did quite a lot of fine work in sewing, knitting, embroidering,
and other kinds of decorative work. There arose schools for
teaching girls and young women feather-work, fancy knitting,
painting on glass, embroidery, netting, fine sewing,
wax-work, the making of artificial fruits and flowers, paper-cutting,
and many other things.

They made most beautiful embroidery. Articles of clothing
had vines, trees, fruits, flowers, and other designs worked
on them and also words and mottoes and texts from the
Bible. Some of the christening caps and robes of the babies
had beautiful embroidered work on them. Among the embroidered
goods of those days were the mourning pieces.[Pg 427]
They had worked on them weeping willows and urns, tombs
and mourning figures, epitaphs, and names of deceased members
of the family or friends with dates of their deaths.

One piece of embroidering which was done by every little
girl in families of standing was the making of a sampler,
which consisted of a long and narrow, or nearly square, piece
of linen canvas with designs worked in colored silks and
wools. These were among the works of children in early
colonial times, as there is one still preserved made by a
daughter of a Pilgrim Father and another bearing on it the
date of 1654. In the older samplers there was little bother
with realism in using the colors as a green horse might be
alongside a blue tree and the green horse might have his
legs worked in red. On them were worked crude or strangely
represented trees and fruits and flowers and animals. There
were verses embroidered and portions of hymns and sometimes
pictures portraying family or public events. Some
were quite pretentious, one such sampler shows the Old
South Church with a coach passing by it and ladies and
gentlemen on horses and afoot in the costumes of the time,
and even a negro lad holding a horse, and birds flying in
the air above them.

Laces were made for using on pillows and made on net
for veils and collars and caps. "Girls spent years working
on a single collar or tucker. Sometimes medallions of this
net lace were embroidered down upon fine linen lawn. I
have infants' caps of this beautiful work, finer than any
needlework of to-day."371

Netting was another of their arts, the net being used on
coverlets and curtains and valances, this kind being made
of cotton thread or twine, while a finer kind was made of
silk or fine cotton for trimming sacks and petticoats; also
netted purses and work-bags as well as knitted ones were
made. On small looms they made tapes and braids and ribbons
for use as glove-ties, shoe-strings, hair-laces, stay-laces,
garters, hatbands, belts, etc.

They did painting on glass, representing fruits and flowers,
and an especial subject was coats of arms. They made
feather-work, which consisted in pasting small feathers or
portions of feathers together to form flowers for use on head-dresses
and bonnets. Another form of decorative work indulged
in by colonial women was the cutting of designs out[Pg 428]
of stiff paper with scissors. They cut out coats of arms,
valentines, wreaths of flowers, marine views, religious symbols,
animals, landscapes, and other designs. They were
sometimes mounted on black paper, framed and glazed, and
given as presents to friends.


Religion. The first colonists of all parts were religiously
inclined. Captain John Smith tells of the first colonists
in Virginia: "We had daily Common Prayer morning and
evening; every Sunday two sermons; and every three months
a holy Communion till our Minister died; but our Prayers
daily with an Homily on Sundays we continued two or three
years after, till more Preachers came."372 They held to the
Church of England and believed in strict observance of
Sunday. This day was kept for religious services and all
were compelled to go to church except the sick and journeys
were forbidden and all work not strictly necessary and all
sports, such as shooting, fishing, game-playing, etc. In New
Netherlands there was likewise strict observance of Sunday
by the Dutch and working, playing in the streets, fishing,
hunting, going on pleasure trips, and such like, were strictly
forbidden. With the Puritans in New England the strictest
observance of Sunday as a holy day was rigidly enforced.
No work on the farm was permitted on that day nor any
pleasures whatsoever in the way of fishing, shooting, sailing,
dancing, jumping, and the like, nor riding except going to
or from church. The laws for this day were rigidly enforced
as is shown from their writings on the subject and
court records. Beside the three faiths as represented above,
there were the Roman Catholics in Maryland, the Quakers in
Pennsylvania, the Baptists in Rhode Island, and Huguenots,
Lutherans, Moravians, Waldenses, Walloons, Jews, and
others, in the different colonies. There was room for any
and all of them and although there were persecutions yet it
did not destroy any faith but caused the people to move out
into new fields where they would be unmolested.

The first places of worship in Virginia were thus described
by Captain John Smith:

"Wee did hang an awning, which is an old saile, to three
of foure trees to shadow us from the Sunne; our walls were
railes of wood; our seats unhewed trees till we cut plankes;
our Pulpit a bar of wood nailed to two neighbouring trees.
In foul weather we shifted into an old rotten tent; this came[Pg 429]
by way of adventure for new. This was our Church till we
built a homely thing like a barne set upon Cratchets, covered
with rafts, sedge, and earth; so also was the walls; the
best of our houses were of like curiosity, that could neither
well defend from wind nor rain."373

In a short time a timber church sixty feet long was built
and some years afterward this church was replaced by a
brick one. Some of the churches in the Southern colonies
were modeled in shape after the old English churches and
were built of stone, but most of them were wooden buildings
without "spires or towers or steeples."

In 1646 the Dutch built a little wooden church in Fort
Orange. The first church at Albany was built in 1657 and
it was simply a blockhouse with loopholes for permitting
guns to be fired through in case of an Indian attack and
three small cannon were placed on the roof. The first church
in New Amsterdam was built of stone and it was seventy-two
feet long. The first church in Brooklyn was built in
1666 and it had thick stone walls with a steep peaked roof
with an open belfry on top. Many of the old Dutch churches
were six-sided or eight-sided with a high, steep, pyramidal
roof, topped with a belfry on which was a weather-vane.

Not long after landing at Plymouth the Puritans built
a fort, which was used as a Lord's Day meeting-place till a
meeting-house was built in 1648. As other settlements were
made, religious services were at first held in tents or under
trees and where a settler had a roomy house this often was
used. The first meeting-house at Boston had mud walls, a
thatched roof, and earthen floor, which was used till 1640.

The first meeting-houses in New England were square and
made of logs with the spaces between the logs filled with
clay and with steep roofs which were thatched with reeds
and long grass and with a beaten earth for a floor. These
buildings were often quite small, one having been thirty-six
feet long, twenty feet wide, and twelve feet high, and another
was but twenty-six feet long and twenty feet wide. Later
these were replaced by larger and better buildings and these
early rude structures were used for granaries and storehouses.

The second form of meeting-houses was a square wooden
building having a truncated pyramidal roof with a belfry
or turret. One of this type, built at Hingham in 1681,[Pg 430]
known as the "Old Ship," is still in existence. The largest
and finest of this second type was the First Church at Boston,
a large square brick building, built in 1713, and which
was used till 1808.

The third type of New England colonial meeting-houses
had a lofty wooden steeple at one end, of which the old
South Church at Boston, a well-known historic building, is
a good example.

In the South the churches were often placed by the waterside
and people came to them over the water in various kinds
of vessels. In New England the first meeting-houses were
often built in the valleys, or the meadow-lands and the
houses of the settlers were built about them. As the population
increased there could no longer be land available for all
in the valleys and the houses were built out near watering
places and pasturage for convenience and so the meeting-houses
began to be placed on hill-tops. This was done so
as to be a lookout for danger from Indians and also so it
could be seen from all parts of the country as the people had
to journey through narrow roads and bridle-paths obscured
by trees and brush. Too, there was a pride in such a location,
to show off a fine meeting-house, which would thus be
visible for many miles around.

The old New England meeting-houses were used for
various purposes, one of the strangest being for the nailing
of the heads of wolves to the logs on the outside. Wolves
were so numerous and so destructive and so feared that
rewards were paid for their killing and to show this the
heads were nailed to the outer walls of the meeting-house.
This was all the decoration that the outer walls of the building
had for near a century as during the seventeenth century
it was considered vain and extravagant to paint them
but by the middle of the eighteenth century paint became
cheaper and more plentiful and the meeting-houses began
not only to be painted but also in conspicuous colors and
towns began to vie with one another in the most striking
displays. One new meeting-house was painted a bright yellow
and soon others were likewise adorned. "Brooklyn
church, then, in 1762, ordered that the outside of its meeting-house
be 'culered' in the approved fashion. The body
of the house was painted a bright orange; the doors and
'bottom boards' a warm chocolate color; the 'window-jets,'
corner-boards, and weather-boards white. What a bright[Pg 431]
nosegay of color! As a crowning glory Brooklyn people
put up an 'Eleclarick Rod' on the gorgeous edifice, and
proudly boasted that Brooklyn meeting-house was the 'newest,
biggest and yallowest' in the county."374

There was no shade about the early meeting-houses in
New England as the trees were cut down around it for fear
of forest fires. There were no curtains nor window-blinds, so
that the heat and blazing light in summer would make it bad
for all in the church. They did often have heavy outside
shutters but they could not be closed during services as the
room would then be made too dark for the minister to see
to read his sermon. Later the forests grew again and they
were not cut away nor cleared up and the meeting-house
would thus become dark and gloomy. Oiled paper was used
in the windows of these early meeting-houses and later when
glass came into use it was nailed in instead of being puttied.

The early meeting-house of the Puritans in New England
were of a very simple interior with raftered walls and sanded
puncheon floors or earthen floors. The early Dutch churches
in New Netherlands also were plain and they were kept in
the greatest cleanliness, scrubbed often and floors sanded
with fine beach-sand. The churches of the Southern colonies
were usually better furnished and flowers were used for decorations,
which was never the case with the Puritans. The
pulpits in all the churches were rather pretentious affairs,
being elevated above the floor, enclosed, with a narrow flight
of stairs leading up to them. At least in the early Puritan
churches there was a sounding-board placed above the pulpit,
which was a board supported from the roof by a slender
iron rod.

In the earliest meeting-houses in New England the seats
were made of rough hand-riven boards placed on legs and
without backs. Later there were pews with narrow seats
around the sides and high partition walls between. In the
early Dutch churches the men had places in pews around the
walls while chairs were placed in the center of the church
for the women to occupy. In some of the Virginia churches
the seats were comfortably cushioned. In later times in all
the churches the pews were carefully assigned and persons
who crowded into pews above their station were unceremoniously
put out by those in charge.

The meeting-houses in New England were wholly without[Pg 432]
means of heating until the middle of the eighteenth century.
Throughout the long and tedious services during the
coldest weather of a bitter climate, attendants at the meetings
had to get along as best they could. The men wore their
heaviest clothing during the services. The minister, too,
would keep himself wrapped up while in the pulpit just as
on his way to the meeting-house. The women in the earlier
times dressed to suit the temperature, but as wealth came
fashion also entered in and thin silk hose, cloth or kid or
silk slippers, linen underclothing, dresses with elbow sleeves
and round low necks, and a thin cloth cape or mantle for the
shoulders was too often in midwinter the Sunday apparel.
The women did protect their heads with caps and mufflers
and veils and their hands with gloves and muffs.

The officials must be given credit for trying to keep the
meeting-house free from the winds as well as possible, as in
some places it was ordered that during the cold weather "no
doors be opened to the windward and only one door to the
leeward." In 1725 in one place it was ordered that the
"several doors of the meeting-house be taken care of and
kept shut in very cold and windy seasons according to the
lying of the wind from time to time; and that people in such
windy weather come in at the leeward doors only, and take
care that they are easily shut both to prevent the breaking
of the doors and the making of a noise."375

In some of the early log meeting-houses the skins of
wolves and other fur-bearing animals were made into bags
which were nailed or tied to the benches in such a way as
to let the people thrust their feet into them for warmth. In
the bitterest weather foot-stoves were taken to the meeting-houses
for the use of the women and children. During the
middle of the eighteenth century stoves began to appear in
the meeting-houses in New England, perhaps the first stove
used having been at Hadley in 1734. But there was a hard
fight to introduce stoves and it was near another century
later before they came into general use.

If the meeting-house should have been situated in a town,
at noon the people went to their homes or to the tavern
or to neighbors' houses in that vicinity to eat their dinners
and to warm themselves. If the meeting-house in the country
was near the home of a hospitable farmer the congregation
would go there at noon. But too often the meeting-house[Pg 433]
was away off at the top of a hill or in an out-of-the-way
place and so there would be built near it a rough-like structure,
known as the "noon-house." Sometimes it was called
the "Sabba-day house" and again a "horse-hows," this last
name because in some of the houses the horses were placed
at one end. At the other end was built a large rough stone
chimney. Of severe Sundays some one, a servant or an older
son, would usually be sent at an early hour to start a good
fire in this fireplace for warming the family after their cold
ride. At noon all would repair to this house for warmth and
for eating their dinner. Before starting for home a warming
was again taken. Too, during the long sermons in forenoon
and afternoon a servant or some member of the family would
replenish the coals in the foot-stoves from the coals in the
fireplace of this noon-house.

In front of the meeting-house there were usually horse-blocks,
or stepping-stones, or hewn logs, for mounting their
horses as usually all rode. All kinds of notices were posted
on the meeting-house, notices of town-meetings, prohibitions
from selling guns and powder to the Indians, notices of sales
of cattle or farms, lists of town officers, copies of the laws
against Sabbath-breaking, notices of intended marriages,
and sometimes even scandalous and insulting libels. Often
on the meeting-house green stood the stocks, pillory, cage,
and whipping-post. The meeting-house was not only used
for religious services, but also for town meetings and likewise
as a store-house. Never having fire in it nor about it,
it was the safest place for a powder-magazine and some
place in it was fitted up for such purpose. Also grain was
stored in its loft and in particular that which might have
been given to the minister as pay for his services.

"In one church in the Connecticut valley, in a township
where it was forbidden that tobacco be smoked upon the
public streets, the church loft was used to dry and store the
freshly cut tobacco-leaves which the inhabitants sold to the
'ungodly Dutch.' Thus did greed for gain lead even blue
Connecticut Christians to profane the house of God."376

There were various ways in colonial times of calling the
people to the religious services of Sunday morning. In
the early times and particularly so in New England, they
did not always have bells on the churches and various devices
were used to let people know when it was time to go to[Pg 434]
church. The time of morning service was usually about
nine o'clock and this was announced sometimes by the tooting
of a horn or the blowing of a conch-shell or the sounding
of a trumpet. The beating of a drum was a very common
signal and some also used the firing of guns, in this latter
the number of times firing was different from that signifying
danger, so as not to frighten the people. Sometimes a flag
was used to notify the people of meeting time, having been
put out when time of notice arrived and left hanging out till
time for the beginning of the service, when the flag was
taken down. Some meeting-houses were supplied with belfries
from which the conch or horn or trumpet was sounded,
or whatever signal was used, and in other places a platform
was made upon top of the meeting-houses for this purpose.
When bells were used, in the early churches there were often
no towers in which to place them and they were hung on
trees near the meeting-house.

At the first signal from conch or trumpet or horn or
drum, the people would be seen starting out from their
homes. With some communities it was the custom for the
congregation to stop at the church door and wait until the
minister and his wife arrived and passed into the house and
then all followed, of course the boys hanging back and
coming in at the very last moment, shuffling and scraping and
clattering with their heavy boots as they went up the stairs
to their place in the loft. Other congregations entered the
church as they came and then all arose as the minister entered
and remained standing till he went into the pulpit
and then sat down as he did. It was also the custom for the
congregation to remain standing in the pews at the close of
the service till the minister had come down from the pulpit,
joined his wife, and passed out to the church-porch, there to
greet the people as they would come out of the church.

It would seem that the most important officer in church
and public life in New England was the tithing-man. "He
was in a degree a constable, a selectman, a teacher, a tax-collector,
an inspector, a sexton, a home-watcher, and above
all, a Puritan Bumble, whose motto was Hic et ubique."377
Among his duties were the seeing that the children learned
the church catechism, looking out that people went to church,
inspecting the taverns to note that they were kept in an
orderly manner and did not sell liquors to disorderly[Pg 435]
persons, and watching that boys and other persons should not
go swimming in the water on week days. His most important
duty, perhaps, was that of keeping order and proper decorum
in the meeting-house by beating out the dogs, prodding the
noisy boys, and awakening the sleeping adults. For this
latter he had a long staff with a knob on one end to tap the
sleeping men while on the other end was a fox-tail to dangle
in the face of the sleeping women. The following from a
journal of those early days tells how well he performed his
duties and some of the effects thereof.

"June 3, 1646.       Allen Bridges hath bin chose to wake
ye sleepers in meeting. And being much proude of his
place, must needs have a fox taile fixed to ye ende of a long
staff wherewith he may brush ye faces of them yt will have
napps in time of discourse, likewise a sharpe thorne whereby
he may pricke such as be most sound. On ye last Lord his day,
as hee strutted about ye meeting-house, he did spy Mr. Tomlins
sleeping with much comfort, hys head kept steadie by
being in ye corner, and his hand grasping ye rail. And
soe spying, Allen did quickly thrust his staff behind Dame
Ballard and give him a grievous prick upon ye hand.
Whereupon Mr. Tomlins did spring vpp mch above ye floore
and with terrible force strike hys hand against ye wall;
and also, to ye great wonder of all, prophanlie exclaim in
a loud voice, curse ye wood-chuck, he dreaming so it seemed
yt a wood-chuck had seized and bit his hand. But on
coming to know where he was, and ye greate scandall he
had committed, he seemed much abashed, but did not speak.
And I think he will not soon again goe to sleepe in meeting."378

Among the Dutch in New Amsterdam there was a somewhat
similar officer, "the voorleezer, or chorister, who was
also generally the bell-ringer, sexton, grave-digger, funeral
inviter, schoolmaster, and sometimes town clerk. He 'tuned
the psalm'; turned the hour-glass; gave out the psalms on a
hanging-board to the congregation; read the Bible; gave up
notices to the dominie by sticking the papers in the end of
a cleft stick and holding it up to the high pulpit."379

The ministers among the Puritans in New England were
very greatly considered. The laity who were bold enough
to criticize or disparage the minister or his teachings were[Pg 436]
severely punished. A woman who spoke harshly of her minister
had her tongue placed in a cleft stick and made to stand
thus in a public place. A man for declaring that he received
no profit from his minister's sermons was fined and severely
whipped. Worse than bodily punishment was excommunication,
for if a minister pronounced such upon a member of his
congregation he was excluded from partaking of the sacrament
and the people of the church refrained from all communion
with him in civil affairs, even from eating and
drinking with him. Yet with all this great power of the
ministers in early Puritan times, they were not permitted to
perform the marriage-service, which was wholly a civil affair,
nor could they pray or exhort at a funeral. The ordination
of so important an officer as the minister was a very important
event. This was celebrated by a great gathering of
people and ministers for many miles around. It was a
deeply serious affair and yet a great festival occasion, for
frequently there was an ordination ball and always an ordination
supper, where there was a plenty and a variety of
things to eat and to drink.

Although the minister's calling was one of trust and
honor it was not also one of profit. The salary was small
and paid in different ways, not a large part of it in cash.
It was the universal custom to provide a house for the
minister and often this was among the very first houses
built in a new town and at its laying out some of the best
lots were set aside for his use. He was also provided with
free pasturage for his horse, the village burial-ground having
been placed at his disposal for pasture land. In the
early days a large part of the salary was paid in corn and
labor and the amount for each church member to give was
fixed by the authorities. Cord-wood was another common
contribution, and each male church-member was expected to
give a load of wood delivered at the door of the parsonage.
Any money contributed by strangers who chanced to attend
the services was usually given to the minister. A spinning
bee, a forerunner of the donation party of later times, was
often held at the home of the minister, wherein each woman
would take her spinning-wheel and flax and all would spend
the day in spinning and give the outcome to the minister's
family. Also the women would meet and make patchwork
bed-quilts and give them to the minister's family. Some
ministers would go out among the members of their congrega[Pg 437]tions
and beg supplies for themselves and families. Many of
the ministers found it necessary to do outside work to make
a living, such as farming on week days, taking young men
to teach and to fit for college, compounding and selling
drugs and medicines; while some were coopers, carpenters,
rope-makers, millers, and cobblers. It took great thrift and
economy on the part of the minister and his family to get
along. The wife not only had to be zealous in religious practices
but also in domestic practices and often she was the
thriftiest wife of the community. Every kind of denial had
to be made and yet with this poverty the minister's children
were quite often well kept and trained and many ministers
were enabled to help their sons to obtain a college education.

Fear of the Indians did not keep the Puritans away
from the meeting-house, but it did cause them to go there
armed. At first each man carried arms to church and then
later a certain number were detailed to arm themselves. In
1642 in Massachusetts the law provided for six men to be
at the meeting-house with muskets and powder and shot.
The armed men were placed near the door so as to be ready
to protect the congregation or to rush out in case of need.
When the services were ended, the armed guards went out
of the meeting-house first and then the other men and the
women and children were last, thus to be protected. Too, it
was the custom for the men always to sit at the door of the
pew, next to the aisle, so they could be ready to get their
arms and rush out in case of a fight. Also being at the
door of the pew the father could better protect the other
members of the family, and a man who would not have
occupied this place would have been considered a poor kind
of husband and father.

In the early colonial days in New England there were two
services in the meeting-house on Sunday, in the forenoon and
in the afternoon. The sermons were long, two or three hours
not being uncommon and some even ran up to five hours in
length. Added to these long sermons were long prayers, frequently
an hour in length and sometimes even continuing for
three hours. At a desk near the pulpit there was an hour-glass
and sitting near it was an officer of the church whose
duty it was to turn it at the end of the hour. During the
prayer the congregation stood, about its middle the minister
would make a long pause to let the infirm and those ill sit
down, but all the others remained standing till its close. It[Pg 438]
was the duty of the tithing-man to see that no one left the
house before the close of the services without there was a
real good reason and also he was to keep the congregation
awake. These long prayers and sermons were not disliked
by the congregation, but on the contrary they considered it
a great gift for the minister to be able to continue long in
prayer and a short sermon would have been looked upon as
irreligious and lacking in reverence, and beside that was
for what the minister was paid. "In every record and
journal which I have read, throughout which ministers and
laymen recorded all the annoyances and opposition which
the preachers encountered, I have never seen one entry of
any complaint or ill-criticism of too long praying or preaching."380

The music of the Puritan meeting-house is well summarized
in the following: "The singing of the psalms was
tedious and unmusical, just as it was in churches of all denominations
both in America and England at that date.
Singing was by ear and very uncertain, and the congregation
had no notes, and many had no psalm-books, and hence no
words. So the psalms were 'lined' or 'deaconed'; that is, a
line was read by the deacon, and then sung by the congregation.
Some psalms when lined and sung occupied half an
hour, during which the congregation stood. There were but
eight or nine tunes in general use, and even these were often
sung incorrectly. There were no church organs to help
keep the singers together, but sometimes pitch-pipes were
used to set the key. Bass-viols, clarionets, and flutes were
played upon at a later date in meeting to help the singing.
Violins were too much associated with dance music to be
thought decorous for church music. Still the New England
churches clung to and loved their poor confused psalm-singing
as one of their few delights, and whenever a Puritan,
even in road or field, heard the distant sound of a psalm-tune
he removed his hat and bowed his head in prayer."381


The Child and Religion. The children in the other colonies
were not so strictly reared as those in Puritan New
England. The people in New York enjoined that the constable
attend church to look after such children as profaned
the Sabbath. In Albany complaint was made that
boys and girls coasted down hills on Sunday and in some[Pg 439]
other places that the young people violated the Sabbath by
discoursing on vain things and the running of races. In the
eighteenth century a cage was placed in City Hall Park in
New York for the confining of boys who profaned the Sabbath.

In the meeting-house in New England in colonial times the
young men sat together on one side and the young women
sat in a corresponding place on the other side. The little
girls sat on stools or low seats in the pews with their mothers
or, if too many of them for place in the pew, they would
sit out in the aisle, and sometimes there would be a row
of little girls on a row of little stools extending the full
length of the aisle. In some of the meeting-houses the boys
were seated together on the pulpit and gallery stairs, while
in other houses a place was made for them in the gallery,
but wherever the place they were all herded together.

The boys among the Puritans were as other boys in all
times and among all peoples, and the huddling them together
in meeting-houses only helped to bring out their growing
physical activities, as the taking them away from the
watchfulness of the parents gave them better opportunities
for expression of their repressed powers. One way of doing
this was by slamming the pew-seats at the close of prayer
and sermon and the vigor with which they did this called
for an order from one church at least that "The boys are
not to wickedly noise down there pew-seats." Another pastime
was the twisting of the balustrades of the gallery railing
in order to make them squeak. Whittling and cutting
the woodwork and benches where they sat gave opportunity
to put in time and also to try out their jack-knives. They
passed the time in other ways, for there are court records
showing that youths were taken before magistrates and fined
for playing and laughing in church and doing things to
make others laugh and play.

The best evidence left us to show that boys kept themselves
busy in the meeting-houses is that they kept other
people busy attending to them. There are plenty of records
left to show that the tithing-man was continually being ordered
to look after the behavior of the boys and also of the
appointing of extra men to look after these unruly beings,
in one church as many as six men had to be appointed at
one time to keep them in order. These men had power to
inflict punishment on the boys, and they did not hesitate[Pg 440]
to rap them soundly with their sticks and, too, sometimes a
boy was taken out of the meeting-house and given a severe
whipping. The tithing-man also used other means, for sometimes
he took a boy from his place with the other boys and
paraded him across the house and put him by side his
mother on the women's side. If a young man would not behave
himself, sometimes he was taken away from his place
among the men and led to where the boys sat and forced
to sit with them. Even during the noon hour the boys were
watched over. While in the noon-house they had to listen
to Bible teachings and interpretations. This was done to
keep them quiet during this time so they might not "sporte
and playe."

It is not wondered at that under such training much early
religion developed. The Bible was read through many times
by the young and much precocity in religious things was
developed. A father gives in his diary the following in reference
to a little girl of eight: "A little while after dinner
she burst out into an amazing cry, which caused all the family
to cry, too. Her mother asked the reason; she gave none.
At last said she was afraid she would goe to Hell; her sins
were not pardoned. She was first wounded by my reading
a sermon of Mr. Norton's, Text, ye shall seek me and shall
not find me. And those words in the sermon, ye shall seek
me and die in your sins ran in her mind and terrified her
greatly ... told me she was afraid she should go to
Hell, was like Spira not elected."382

Another father makes this entry in his diary about his
four-year-old daughter: "I took my little daughter Katy
into my study and then I told my child I am to dye shortly
and shee must, when I am dead, remember Everything I now
said to unto her. I sett before her the sinful Condition of
her nature, and I charged her to pray in Secret Places every
Day. That God for the sake of Jesus Christ would give her
a New Heart. I gave her to understand that when I am
taken from her she must look to meet with more humbling
Afflictions than she does now she has a Tender Father to provide
for her."383

These two quotations are from the diaries of educated men,
the first being from Judge Sewall and the second from Cotton
Mather. It is hard for us now to see any reason for[Pg 441]
such a talk as Cotton Mather gave a child of four, especially
as he lived for thirty years afterward and died long after
this little girl died.

The religious books of Puritan New England children were
of a remarkable character. Mrs. Earle gives the following
in reference to one of the most popular and widely read
books:

"Young babes chide their parents for too infrequent praying,
and have ecstacies of delight when they can pray ad
infitum. One child two years old was able 'savingly to understand
the mysteries of Redemption'; another of the same
age was a 'dear lover of faithful ministers.' Anne Greenwich,
who died when five years old, 'discoursed most astonishingly
of great mysteries'; Daniel Bradley, who had an
'Impression and inquisitiveness of the State of Souls after
Death,' when three years old; Elizabeth Butcher, who,
'when two and a half years old, as she lay in the Cradle
would ask herself the Question What is my corrupt Nature:
and would answer herself It is empty of Grace, bent unto
Sin, and only to Sin, and that Continually,' were among the
distressing examples."384

The following is an extract from a letter written about
1638 by a Puritan boy of twelve years of age and well displays
the tendency toward religious fears as found in the
young people of that period:

"Though I am thus well in body yet I question whether
my soul doth prosper as my body doth, for I perceive yet to
this very day, little growth in grace; and this makes me
question whether grace be in my heart or no. I feel also
daily great unwillingness to good duties, and the great
ruling of sin in my heart; and that God is angry with me
and gives me no answers to my prayers; but many times
he even throws them down as dust in my face; and he does
not grant my continued request for the spiritual blessing of
the softening of my hard heart. And in all this I could yet
take some comfort but that it makes me to wonder what
God's secret decree concerning me may be: for I doubt
whether even God is wont to deny grace and mercy to his
chosen (though uncalled) when they seek unto him by prayer
for it; and, therefore, seeing he doth thus deny it to me, I
think that the reason of it is most like to be because I belong
not unto the election of grace. I desire that you would let[Pg 442]
me have your prayers as I doubt not but I have them, and
rest

"Your Son, Samuel Mather."385

As was given under the discussion of infancy, the Puritan
babe had to be taken to the meeting-house on the Sunday following
its birth to be baptized, even in the most bitter weather.
One record is given of the baptism of an infant but four
days old and this during the first part of February. In
one diary there is given about a day in January so bad that
but few women could get out to meeting, and yet a babe
was taken to the meeting-house and baptized. It must be
considered, too, that this occurred in a building that never
had had a fire in it nor was there fire on that day. It is
difficult for us at this day to hold even in imagination the
carrying of the young babe by the midwife through the
snow and the wind, and the cold of a New England January,
the taking him to the altar and placing him in the arms of
his father, the throwing the icy cold water over the child,
and the shuddering of the child; yet worse, for this baptism
might have been an immersion in the cold water after the
ice had been broken, for at least one minister did practice
infant immersion.


Education. There arose during colonial times in the
United States three chief systems of education. These forms
came about through the ideas of the people settling the different
parts of the country and through conditions arising
from industrial occupations. In the southern colonies, in
particular in Virginia, where the pursuits that arose produced
plantation life with houses scattered and no town or
village life, there was followed the educational ideas of England
and education took upon itself the form of higher and
secondary training for the ruling classes with but little provision
for elementary education. There was no free public
education, the nearest approach to a common elementary
school was what was designated the "field school," which
was originated by a neighborhood and supported by tuition
fees, and often held in a shabby building on an old exhausted
tobacco field. There did arise, however, secondary schools
which were chartered and endowed, resembling the endowed
Latin schools of England.

The second form of schools was the parochial organiza[Pg 443]tion
of the middle colonies of New Netherlands and Pennsylvania.
In these colonies there arose a school in connection
with a church and, unlike the education of the South,
which was along secondary training, the work of this parochial
school was chiefly in elementary education. In New
Netherlands, as in Holland, the church was connected with
the state and there was but one church, the Dutch Reformed,
and the civil and religious authorities jointly controlled and
directed the education. In Pennsylvania, however, religious
and civil freedom had been granted from the very first and
there had come into the colony people of different nationalities
and of different religions, and education came to be established
with the different religious bodies and each religious
sect had its own distinctive parochial school alongside
its own church. There also were some attempts at
higher and secondary education. Among the schools started
was the Penn Charter School, which was originally organized
by the Friends in 1689, and there were higher schools
of other denominations. When New Netherlands fell into
the hands of the English, there came about in New York
conditions somewhat similar to those in Virginia and a number
of secondary schools were organized.

The third type of schools in colonial times was that formed
by governmental action in the New England colonies of
Massachusetts and Connecticut. In these colonies there was
no such class distinctions as in Virginia, and, unlike Pennsylvania,
there was but one nationality and one religion,
and, unlike the Dutch of New Netherlands, they had cut
themselves away from the ruling classes of their native land,
and thus they were free to develop along their own ideas.
Their religious belief and training called for the education
of each of the members of the colony, as the Bible was held
to be the infallible rule of faith and practice, and so every
one should at least have enough schooling to enable him to
read the Bible for himself. Hence schools arose in a short
time after settlement. In 1644 Salem taxed all who had children
and were able to pay and procured in this way means
for paying for the schooling of children whose parents were
too poor to pay for them. In 1647 Massachusetts passed a law
that in every town of fifty families a school for the teaching
of reading and writing should be provided and that in a
town of one hundred families a grammar school should be
provided. Connecticut in 1659 provided for its children in[Pg 444]
the same way. But all such schools were not free as we term
free schools now, and it was not till near the time of the
Revolution that general taxes were levied for school purposes
and free schools were thereby established.

The early schoolhouses in Pennsylvania and New York
were made of logs and the top covered with bark. Holes
were cut in the sides for windows, which sometimes were
covered with greased paper that let in a dim light. Some
had a rough puncheon floor and others a dirt floor. A distance
up from the floor around the walls pegs were placed
between the logs and boards laid on them for desks and by
them were boards set on stakes for seats for the older children,
while the younger children sat on blocks or benches
of logs. At one end or in the middle was a catted chimney.
At least some of the schoolhouses in New England were better
furnished, as is shown by the following entry in the town
records of Roxbury in 1652:

"The feoffes agreed with Daniel Welde that he provide
convenient benches with forms, with tables for the scholars,
and a conveniente seate for the scholmaster, a Deske to put
the Dictionary on and shelves to lay up bookes."386

This schoolhouse was not kept in proper repairs, as the
teacher in Roxbury in 1681 wrote:

"Of inconveniences (in the schoolhouse) I shall mention
no other but the confused and shattered and nastie posture
that it is in, not fitting for to reside in, the glass broke,
and thereupon very raw and cold; the floor very much
broken and torn up to kindle fires, the hearth spoiled, the
seats some burned and others out of kilter, that one had as
well-nigh as goods keep school in a hog stie as in it."387

Supplies for school purposes were quite scarce in colonial
times. There were no blackboards nor maps. Paper was
quite scarce and very carefully used. Birch bark was used
to cipher on. Slates also were used and those of the earlier
times had no frames and had a hole in one side in which a
string could be tied for holding a pencil or for hanging
around the neck. If lead pencils were used at all during
colonial times it was in the latest part of the period. Instead
of lead pencils they used plummets made of lead
melted and cast into wooden molds and cut into shape by a
jack-knife. Pens were cut from goose-quills and it required[Pg 445]
quite a little skill to make good pens and keep them in order.
Ink was made by dissolving ink-powder, each child furnishing
his own ink-bottle or ink-horn and ink. Sometimes
the ink was wholly home-made: "In remote districts of Vermont,
Maine, and Massachusetts, home-made ink, feeble and
pale, was made by steeping the bark of the swamp-maple in
water, boiling the decoction till thick, and diluting it with
copperas."388

There were not a great number or variety of books for use
in these early schools. The two most noted books were the
Hornbook and the New England Primer. The hornbook was
the first book used by the child. This consisted of a thin
piece of wood about five inches long and two inches wide. A
sheet of paper was placed upon this. At the top of this
paper came the alphabet in small letters; then the alphabet
in capital letters followed; then the vowels; then syllables,
as, ab, eb, ib, etc.; next "In the Name of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen;" and last came
the Lord's prayer. Over this paper went a sheet of horn,
through which the printed matter could be read. The paper
and the horn were fastened to the wood by strips of brass
or other metal, going around the sides and ends, and all held
fast by tacks driven through the metal strips. At the lower
end of the hornbook was usually a handle, which sometimes
had a hole through it for a string to carry it by or to hang
it around the neck.

"The New England Primer is a poorly printed little book
about five inches long and three wide, of about eighty pages.
It contains the alphabet, and a short table of easy syllables,
such as a-b, ab, e-b, eb, and words up to those of six syllables.
This was called a syllabarium. There were twelve five-syllable
words; of these five were abomination, edification,
humiliation, mortification, and purification. There were a
morning and evening prayer for children, and a grace to be
said before meat. Then followed a set of little rhymes which
have become known everywhere, and are frequently quoted.
Each letter of the alphabet is illustrated with a blurred little
picture. Of these, two-thirds represent Biblical incidents.
They begin:


'In Adam's fall
We sinned all,'[Pg 446]


and ended with Z:


'Zaccheus he
Did climb a tree
His Lord to see.'


"In the early days of the Primer, all the colonies were
true to the English king, and the rhyme for the letter K
reads:


'King Charles the Good
No man of blood.'


"But by Revolutionary years the verse for K was changed
to:


'Queens and Kings
Are Gaudy Things.'


"Later verses tell the praise of George Washington. Then
comes a series of Bible questions and answers; then an 'alphabet
of lessons for youth,' consisting of verses of the Bible
beginning successively with A, B, C, and so on. X was
a difficult initial letter, and had to be contented with 'Xhort
one another daily, etc.' After the Lord's prayer and
Apostle's Creed appeared sometimes a list of names for men
and women, to teach children to spell their own names. The
largest and most interesting picture was that of the burning
at the stake of John Rogers; and after this a six page set
of pious rhymes which the martyr left at his death for his
family of small children. After the year 1750, a few very
short stories were added to its pages, and were probably
all the children's stories that many of the scholars of that
day ever saw."389

In the establishing of the elementary schools in New England
there was but little more required of the teacher than
to instruct the children in reading and writing, especially
were they to be taught sufficiently that they could read the
Bible. Also they were to be taught enough arithmetic for
their every-day needs. This is well shown in the records of
the town of Plymouth, where in 1671 they had built a
schoolhouse and employed a schoolmaster "to teach the children
and youth to read the Bible, to write, and to cast accounts."390
In the secondary schools the emphasis was laid[Pg 447]
upon Latin and such other subjects were taught as would
fit the scholars for college. Penmanship was made a great
deal of while orthography was not, the results of which
are shown by the writing and spelling of the diaries and
other writings of that period that remain.

The work of the district school, of the academy, and of
the college is well portrayed by McMaster. "The daily
labors of the schoolmaster who taught in the district school-house
three generations since were confined to teaching his
scholars to read with a moderate degree of fluency, to write
legibly, to spell with some regard for the rules of orthography,
and to know as much of arithmetic as would enable them
to calculate the interest on a debt, to keep the family accounts,
and to make change in a shop.... To sit eight
hours a day on the hardest of benches poring over Cheever's
Accidence; to puzzle over long words in Dilworth's speller; to
commit to memory pages of words in Webster's American Institute;
to read long chapters in the Bible; to learn by heart
Dr. Watt's hymns for children; to be drilled in the Assembly
Catechism; to go to bed at sundown, to get up at sunrise, and
to live on brown bread and pork, porridge and beans, made up,
with morning and evening prayers, the every-day life of the
lads at most of the academies and schools of New England....
The four years of residence at college were spent in the
acquisition of Latin and Greek, a smattering of mathematics,
enough of logic to distinguish barbara from celarent, enough
of rhetoric to know climax from metonomy, and as much of
metaphysics as would enable one to talk learnedly about a
subject he did not understand."391

The teachers of the elementary schools of those early days
were too often not educated nor cultured men. These men
in many cases were drunken, cruel, ignorant, and lazy.
Drunkenness seems to have been quite prevalent among the
teachers of early New York, and yet there were some most
excellent men among them. In the middle and southern
colonies among the teachers were redemptioners and exported
criminals. It was not uncommon on the arrival of a ship for
schoolmasters to be advertised for sale along with men of
other callings and usually the teachers did not fetch as good
prices as weavers, tailors, and the like. The teachers in the
secondary schools, on the contrary, often were men of good
scholarship and of high standing in the community, occupy[Pg 448]ing
a place of honor among their fellow men. Such teachers
were Christopher Dock in Pennsylvania and Ezekiel Cheever
in New England.

"Among the New England teachers there were men of both
learning and ability. Not a more cultured body of men ever
formed a colony than settled about Boston, Salem, New
Haven, and Hartford. They coveted the best advantages
for their children, frequently making the best men their
teachers. It is on record that of the twenty-two masters of
Plymouth from 1671 to the Revolution, twenty were graduates
of Harvard. The like was true of Roxbury. Such
men, next to the functionaries of church and state, commanded
the highest respect. In the churches they had special
pews provided for their use beside those of magistrates
and the deacon's family. In every community was usually
one who was the teacher professionally, so considered as much
as was the minister or physician."392

There were women teachers in the colonial times. They
taught what was known as dame-schools, which were attended
by small boys and girls. Women teachers and dame-schools
were probably confined to New England and parts of New
York adjacent to New England and settled by emigrants
from there. There grew up the custom in some rural districts
of having one term of school in the summer for the
younger pupils and taught by a woman and another term
in the winter for the older pupils and taught by a man.
This arrangement arose because it was difficult for the
younger children to attend school during the bitter weather
of the winter, while the older pupils could attend well only
during the cold time of the year when there was not much
work to do on the farm.

There is in existence a contract between a Dutch schoolmaster
and the authorities of Flatbush, New York, of the
date of October 8, 1682. This is a full paper and quite well
shows the duties of a teacher of that time in that colony.
The school day was to be from eight o'clock to eleven and
from one to four. Each forenoon and afternoon session was
to open and close with prayer. On every Wednesday and
Saturday the schoolmaster was to instruct the children in the
common prayers and in the catechism and to be present at
the church meeting when the children were catechized before
the congregation. He was to keep school nine months[Pg 449]
in succession, from September to June of each year. Beside
his school duties he had church duties. He was to keep
the church clean, ring the bell, lead in the singing, and
sometimes he was to read the sermon. He was to provide
water for baptism and to furnish the minister with the name
of the child to be baptized and also the names of the parents
or witnesses. He was to provide bread and wine for the communion.
He was to serve as messenger for the consistory.
He was to give out the funeral invitations, dig the grave,
and toll the bell.393

It can scarcely be believed that the schoolmasters of the
early period of our country could have been so cruel as is
told of them. It would appear as if a great deal more time
was put upon devising means of punishment than upon learning
ways of instruction. It was a time of cruelty and of
belief in the general depravity of humanity. It was deemed
that there was a natural wilfulness in children that needed
stern repression and harsh correction. The parents and
teachers in New England were especially repressive of child
nature and their guide and rule of action, the Bible, gave
them constant proof of the need of corrective punishment
for children. "John Robinson, the Pilgrim preacher, said
in his essay on Children and Their Education: 'Surely there
is in all children (though not alike) a stubbornes and stoutnes
of minde arising from naturall pride which must in the
first place be broken and beaten down that so the foundation
of their education being layd in humilitie and tractablenes
other virtues may in their time be built thereon.'"394

The rod was very greatly in use by the schoolmasters of
colonial times and too often the rod became the cudgel.
Some teachers had the boy mount the back of another boy
and with arms and legs held tight he was given a beating.
The ferule was applied to the hands, the face, and the feet,
and sometimes this ferule was a heavy oaken ruler. One
instrument used was a hickory club with leather thongs attached
at one end and similar to it was the tattling stick, a
cat-o'-nine-tails with heavy leather straps. Another instrument
used was termed a flapper, which was a piece of leather
about six inches wide with a hole in the middle and fastened
to a handle. Every stroke with this flapper on a boy's bared[Pg 450]
back would raise a blister the size of the hole in the leather.
A branch of a tree was split and placed over a child's nose
and he had to then stand before the school. For whispering
a whispering-stick was used, which was a kind of wooden
gag tied in the mouth with strings, somewhat as a horse's
bit. Another punishment was to put two boys together in a
yoke devised for that purpose, similar to an ox-yoke, and to
make the punishment all the more disgraceful would be to
yoke a boy and girl together. A unipod, a one-legged stool,
was used, and the child occupying it found it very hard and
tiresome to balance himself on it. The dames in their schools
used quite freely a heavy iron thimble, which by being
snapped quite vigorously against a boy's head would make
for him "thimell-pie." The dunce-block was freely used and
the culprit appropriately labelled, as, "Tell-Tale," "Bite-Finger-Baby,"
"Lying Ananias," "Idle-Boy," and "Pert-Miss-Prat-a-Pace."
There were some teachers who did not
use such cruel punishments, although they must have been
very few in number, one being Samuel Dock, a German
schoolmaster of Pennsylvania, who was intelligent enough to
be kind to his children, but there were plenty of the drunken,
dirty, careless, and cruel teachers in that colony. Mrs.
Earle states: "I may say here that I have not found that
New York schoolmasters were ever as cruel as were those of
New England."395

"I often fancy that I should have enjoyed living in the
good old times, but I am glad I never was a child in colonial
New England       to have been baptized in ice water, fed on
brown bread and warm beer, to have had to learn the Assembly's
Catechism and 'explain all the Quaestions with conferring
Texts,' to have been constantly threatened with fear
of death and terror of God, to have been forced to commit
Wigglesworth's 'Day of Doom' to memory, and, after all, to
have been whipped with a tattling-stick."396

The colonial period was an age of child precocity. In that
time overzealous parents pushed children forward till they
displayed a remarkable precocious learning, to end, in most
cases, in an early death either physically or mentally, and
yet some of these children did survive the process to become
noted and honored men. One such parent wrote to her sister
asking to have sent to her a set of toys now known as alpha[Pg 451]bet
blocks and stating that the child's father was contriving
a set of toys to teach the child his letters by the time he
could speak, he being not yet four months old at the time
of the letter. In a later letter the mother wrote to the child's
aunt that at twenty-two months of age he could tell his letters
in any book and he was beginning to spell. This boy
grew up to be the Revolutionary General Charles Cotesworth
Pinckney. One boy born in 1752 learned his alphabet
in a single lesson and he could read the Bible before he was
four years old. At the age of six he was sent to a grammar
school, and, as his father would not let him study Latin, he
borrowed a Latin grammar and studied through it twice
without a teacher. This boy afterward was known as President
Timothy Dwight of Yale College.

This precociousness was not confined to boys, for one little
girl, born in Boston in 1708, daughter of the President
of Harvard College, before her second year was finished
could speak distinctly, knew her letters, could relate many
stories out of the Scriptures, and when three years old she
could recite the greater part of the Assembly's Cathechism
and also she could recite many of the psalms and many lines
of poetry and read distinctly. The Governor of the colony
and other distinguished guests at her home sometimes would
place this little girl on a table to show off her acquirements.
Another little girl, born in Charleston, South Carolina, in
1759, in her third year could "read any book," so the story
ran, and, too, this she could do holding the book upside
down.

Boys entered the Boston Latin School as young as six and
a half years of age and often parents had them begin Latin
at an earlier age, some parents teaching their little ones to
read Latin words when but three years old along with the
English. Young Timothy Dwight would have been prepared
to enter college at eight years of age had not his grammar
school been discontinued because of having no teacher. A
boy in 1686 entered Harvard College at eleven years of age
and another boy in 1799 graduated from Rhode Island College
(now Brown University) at barely fourteen years of
age.

The most remarkable case of childish precocity given by
Mrs. Earle was that of Richard Evelyn, who died in 1658
at the early age of five years and three days. The father in
his diary recounted in the following quoted passage the[Pg 452]
wonderful acquirements of the little boy before his death:

"He had learned all his catechism at two years and a half
old; he could perfectly read any of the English, Latin,
French, or Gothic letters, pronouncing the first three languages
exactly. He had, before the fifth year, or in that
year, not only skill to read most written hands, but to decline
all the nouns, conjugate the verbs regular, and most
of the irregular; learned out of Puerelis, got by heart almost
the entire vocabulary of Latin and French primitives and
words, could make congruous syntax, turn English into
Latin, and vice versa, construe and prove what he read, and
did the government and use of relatives, verbs, substances,
ellipses and many figures and tropes, and made a considerable
progress in Comenius' Janua; begun himself to write
legibly and had a strong passion for Greek. The number
of verses he could recite was prodigious, and what he remembered
of the parts of plays which he would also act;
and, when seeing a Plautus in one's hand, he asked what
book it was, and being told it was comedy and too difficult
for him, he wept for sorrow. Strange was his apt and ingenious
application of fables and morals, for he had read
Æsop; he had a wonderful disposition to mathematics, having
by heart divers propositions of Euclid that were read to
him in play, and he would make lines and demonstrate them.
He had learned by heart divers sentences in Latin and Greek
which on occasion he would produce even to wonder. He
was all life, all prettiness, far from morose, sullen, or childish
in anything he said or did."397

The girls of colonial times did not receive much education,
as it was not considered necessary for women to have learning
beyond that necessary for household duties. All that was
considered really needed by a girl in the way of book learning
was to know how to read and write and cipher a little.
Most of the girls received nothing further than elementary
training in reading and writing and many of them did not
even have that much of education. This was true in all the
colonies, New England, New York, and the others.

A lady writing of the education of girls of her time in
New York, in the first quarter of the eighteenth century
stated:

"It was at that time very difficult to procure the means of[Pg 453]
instruction in those island districts; female education was,
of consequence, conducted on a very limited scale; girls
learned needlework (in which they were indeed both skilful
and ingenious) from their mothers and aunts; they were
taught, too, at that period to read, in Dutch, the Bible, and
a few Calvinistic tracts of the devotional kind. But in the
infancy of the settlement few girls read English; when they
did, they were thought accomplished; they generally spoke
it, however imperfectly, and few were taught writing."398

A historian of New York, writing of his fellow townswomen
during the year 1756, said that "there is nothing
they (New York women) so generally neglect as Reading,
and indeed all the Arts for the improvement of the Mind,
in which I confess we have set them the Example."399

The attitude of the people of the period toward the admission
of girls into boys' grammar schools is shown by the
following extract from the rules for governing such a school
in New Haven in 1684:

"... and all girls be excluded as improper and inconsistent
with such a grammar school as ye law injoines and as
is the Designe of this settlement."400

But it must not be considered that the education of the
girls was wholly neglected among the colonists, for, though
they were scarcely ever admitted to boys' schools, yet they
did go to the dame-schools and also they received training
at home. The girls were all taught household duties and
the fancy needlework that went with it. Reading, writing, a
little arithmetic, dancing, needlework, music, deportment,
and elegance of carriage composed the curriculum for girls.
Sometimes a girl would get some help from a brother and
thus gain an education beyond that ordinarily obtained by
girls. Occasionally an educated father would teach his
daughter, one such case being that of President Colman of
Harvard College, who gave what was called a profound education
to his daughter Jane. Withal this meager education,
nevertheless we are not at all ashamed of the bearing of our
foremothers of the colonial and Revolutionary times.

As academies grew up during the latter half of the eighteenth
century, most of which were for boys, a few were made[Pg 454]
co-educational and a few others were established for
girls:

"For a hundred years the Penn Charter School, Philadelphia,
had admitted both sexes on equal terms. The Moravians
had established a school for girls at Bethlehem, Pa., as
early as 1745, while the Philadelphia Female Academy dates
from the Revolution. Among the earliest in New England
were Dr. Dwight's Young Ladies' Academy, at Greenfield,
Conn. (1785), and the Medford School, near Boston
(1789)."401

Of the colleges in the United States today, two of them
were founded during the first century of the colonial period,
the seventeenth century, ten others in the next century before
the Revolution, and by the close of the eighteenth century
the list had increased to twenty-six, eleven of the original
colonies being represented in the list and also Kentucky and
Tennessee. Arranging the twelve colleges of the colonial
period in the order of the year of first opening and with the
names and locations as now, they run as follows:402

Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1636;
College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia, 1693;
Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, 1701; Washington
College, Chestertown, Maryland, 1723; University of
Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 1740; Moravian
Seminary and College for Women, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania,
1742; Princeton University, Princetown, New Jersey, 1746;
Washington and Lee University, Lexington, Virginia, 1749;
Columbia University, New York City, New York, 1754;
Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, 1765; Rutgers
College, New Brunswick, New Jersey, 1766; Dartmouth College,
Hanover, New Hampshire, 1769.

With dame-schools for the younger children, district
schools for the older ones, academies for the yet more advanced,
and colleges for completing the education, the early
period of the United States gave such an education to its
young people as well to prepare them to become the noble
men and women, who, by books, papers, addresses, and general
bearing, were able to stand alongside the people of the
world in the great period of the American Revolution, and
furnished thinkers and doers such as have not been surpassed
by our own time.[Pg 455]

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
