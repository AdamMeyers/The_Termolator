THE DEVIL




ACT I


SCENE.       Room next to KARL'S studio. At the back of the
stage to the L. is a glass door with portière towards the
stage. When this door is opened one can see the studio.
Bach of the stage to the R. a fireplace with burning
fire. Round the fireplace an elevation about half a yard
high reaching into the middle of the room. This elevation
is bordered by a wooden railing with an opening on each
side       in the middle of the railing an ancient Gothic chair,
with back towards the public; the back of the chair must be
so high that a person sitting in it cannot be seen by the
public. On the R. a door leading into the entrance hall of
the apartment. There is a little invisible door covered as
the rest of the room, with wall paper, on the L. near the
footlights. About a yard from this door, a settee with the
head end towards the glass door of the studio. Next to this
settee a small, ancient table, about one yard high. On the
L. a curio cabinet (small); next to it a hall stand with
some shawls of different colors. On L. next the settee a
large, gilded, stand-up candelabra, as used in churches.

There are many sketches, framed and unframed, about the
room       some statues, some heads, and a very elegant electric
candelabra hanging in the middle of the room. The whole
thing unharmonious but artistic. Down stage on the R. a
medium-sized table littered with books, magazines and
bric-à-brac; a large palette lies on the top of some books
and scattered among the other things some tubes of paint
and paint brushes.



(When the Curtain rises the stage is empty for a
few minutes.)

KARL, comes in with hat and overcoat which he takes off

Heinrich! Heinrich!



[HEINRICH, coming from studio.

KARL

Where were you?

HEINRICH

Nowhere, sir.

KARL

The door is wide open; anybody could have walked in.



[HEINRICH goes into the studio and comes out
with a velvet house-jacket. Calling after him:

Where's today's paper?



[He finds the newspaper.

Well, hurry up.



[HEINRICH comes back and helps KARL put on his
jacket.

KARL, lights a cigarette

Did you take my dress suit to be pressed?

HEINRICH

Yes, sir: he will bring it back in an hour.



[Starts R.

KARL

Good! Here's a crown. Get me a white tie, same as the last
one.

[HEINRICH starts R.

Hold on! Put out a dress shirt on the bed, then look for my
pearl buttons       they are probably in the top drawer       in a
match-box. Stop! Give me that crown. Take this.



[Gives him a bill.

Get me a pair of white gloves, seven and a half. Oh! and
Heinrich, before you go, put the Venetian chair next to the
window. At three o'clock Mrs. Zanden will be here to have
her portrait painted, and I shall be at home to nobody.



[Reclines on the settee.

Give me an ash tray.

[HEINRICH gives it to him.

All right; go along.

HEINRICH

Beg your pardon, sir       

KARL, seated on couch L.

What is it?

HEINRICH

Mimi is here.

KARL

Where?

HEINRICH

Waiting in the studio.

KARL, indifferent, reading newspaper

Send her away.

HEINRICH, goes to the glass door

Fräulein, Herr Marler does not need you today.



[Exit L.

MIMI, coming in

Hallo.

[KARL is silent, continues reading his paper.



[MIMI comes down L.

Don't you want to work today?

KARL

No.



[Continues reading paper.

[HEINRICH goes into the studio.

MIMI, in bad humor, crosses to C.

Good-bye.



[Turns around.

And tomorrow?

KARL

No.

MIMI, sad

Good-bye. (Wipes her eyes.) You don't love me any more
... you don't love me any more.

KARL

Oh! It's going to start again!

MIMI

Ever since last fall you've been different. I knew it right
away when you started to paint landscapes. When you are in
love you paint Venuses. I know what it means when you start
to paint trees.

KARL

You're silly, Mimi.

MIMI

I know it. With her hat and coat on every model is silly.

KARL

Go home, Mimi.

MIMI, goes to head of couch

Yes, yes. Go home! Be a good girl. For a week now you've
sent me home without my even taking my gloves off. I'm no
use any more.



[Begins to cry but stops it at once.

Look here: I know everything.

KARL

Really?

MIMI



[From behind him, raises his head.

Look at me! Look at me! You want to get married? Tell me
No       you don't dare.

KARL

No.

MIMI, comes to L. of him

Oh, you tell me anything you want to my face; but I know
you're going to marry a girl named Elsa       the wife of your
friend Mr. Zanden has arranged everything       look at me
and deny it, if you dare. After all, what's the use! you
wouldn't tell me the truth anyway.

KARL

You little mind-reader.

MIMI

She's a nice one, Mrs. Zanden! Instead of taking you on
herself, she marries you to a friend of hers. But I don't
care; you don't love me any more       doing landscapes all the
time.

KARL

Well, what do you want?

MIMI, crosses to R. of him and kneels

Tell me you do love me. (Pouting.)

KARL, bored

Yes, yes       of course.

MIMI, imitating him

Yes, yes, of course. Is that the best you can do?

KARL

Well, what shall I say?

MIMI

Oh! You painters! It's always the same. First you say:
"What an angel! What a Madonna! What a Venus! What color!
What hair! What lines!" Then all of a sudden, it's: "Oh, my
dear! Why, you've gone yellow." The next day you're green,
and then it's: "I have no time today." And, first thing you
know, you're       pooh! Landscapes. (Scornfully.)



[She goes to him above table at head of couch,
takes his head in her hands.

Don't you like me?

KARL, smiling

Why, yes.

MIMI

If you were really nice, you would at least promise to
marry me. All the other artists promised. They weren't so
mean as you are! Oh yes, I know I am annoying you. I'm
absolutely boring you.

KARL

If you were not such a dear little nuisance        [Reaches up
and draws her down to him.        I would have done with you a
long time ago.



[Kisses her.

And now, run away, little girl: go home.

MIMI

Don't you want me tomorrow? or the day after tomorrow?

KARL

No.

MIMI, crossing to him at couch

You will never have me pose any more for you at all?

KARL, rises; crosses with her to door R.

I'll look in on you this evening on my way to the Zandens'.

MIMI

But you can't work in my house. I've only a lamp!

KARL

Ha! Ha! Ha! Well, we'll put that out!



[Has taken her to the door.

MIMI

Oh, will we!



[Laughing.

Maybe you'll get put out.

KARL

Bye, bye!



[MIMI exits.

[Lights another cigarette       the bell rings
sharply. Calls, somewhat excited.

Heinrich! Heinrich!

HEINRICH, comes in from studio

Yes, sir.



[Runs through the door on the R., which he
leaves open, and goes off to open the hall door.

KARL



[Fixes his tie nervously, puts away newspaper,
puts out his cigarette in ash tray, and arranges
his hair. He goes towards the door through which
HERMAN and OLGA enter, HEINRICH closes the
door from the outside, KARL bows.

Madame!



[Bows silently to HERMAN.

HERMAN, in a hurry

I only came to bring Olga, my boy: I must go back at once.



[OLGA has been looking around.

OLGA, going to C. and over to L.

So this is the famous studio.

KARL, looking around

Funny, isn't it? More like a junk shop.

HERMAN

We might have chosen another day to begin Olga's
portrait       we have waited six years, so we could just as
well have waited until tomorrow; but the preparations for
tonight's ball made Olga so nervous that I thought it
best to bring her here. You know this ball is a kind of
house-warming.



[Crosses over to C.

OLGA

We were obliged to invite such a lot of people, to clear
off our social obligations.

HERMAN

I wish it was over. I hate these functions. Old Freebody,
in whose business I started, was worth ninety millions, and
he never gave a party in his life       or anything else, for
that matter. When do you want me to call for Olga?

KARL, R. C.

Well, it gets dark very early now: in three quarters of an
hour we won't be able to see any more.

HERMAN

Well, then       

KARL, looking at his watch

Let's say four o'clock.

OLGA, after looking at a picture L. very closely

Who is that?

KARL

Oh, some model.

OLGA

Wasn't that the girl we just met on the stairs?

HERMAN crosses quickly to L.

I must have a look at her.



[Looks at picture.

[OLGA stands so as to hide picture.

Oh, better not.



[Makes a gesture as if he had seen something
indecent.

Well, every minute counts       I must be off.

[Shakes his finger at KARL.

You'll have to stop that sort of thing, now, Karl. You know
you are one of the reasons of tonight's ball. Isn't he,
Olga?

OLGA

Yes       tonight Karl is to fall in love with his future wife.

KARL, goes L. C.

I shall do my best.



[To HERMAN.

Sentenced to marry! Well, I'm prepared to meet my doom.

OLGA, seated on couch, with a little sigh

At last! I shall be glad.

HERMAN

So shall I. So will the girl. So will Karl.

KARL

I hope so. She's a charming girl.

OLGA

Wait till you       

KARL

I know       I know. I shall adore her. But I have till this
evening, you know.

HERMAN, crossing to OLGA

Well, I'm off. My agent may telephone any minute.



[He kisses OLGA'S hand.

I shall call for you at four o'clock, my dear. And don't
worry about tonight: the caterer has his instructions.



[Crossing to R., shaking hands with KARL, who
holds him back.

KARL, shaking HERMAN'S hand

Aren't you afraid to leave your wife?

HERMAN

Shall I tell you the truth? I'm hurrying because I'm afraid
of changing my mind and taking Olga away with me.

OLGA

You're not jealous?

HERMAN, at door

If I wasn't afraid of appearing ridiculous, I would say: Be
good! And now, good-bye.



[He goes off, KARL bringing him to the door of
entrance hall.

KARL



[Coming back, closes the door, stands still for
a minute       when he comes back, OLGA shivers
slightly and touches her forehead with her hand.

[Crosses to L. C. by OLGA.

What is it?

OLGA, with a nervous, soft laugh

Nothing       nothing at all.

KARL, tenderly

Are you frightened?



[OLGA does not answer.

Tell me.

OLGA, nervous, confused, as if she was afraid of him

I don't know, but       I feel as if       as if       

KARL

What do you mean?

OLGA, trying to laugh, but very nervously

I had the same feeling once in Dresden, when my mother took
me to a boarding-school and left me there. I felt as if I
were quite alone in this wide, strange world       and now       you
know yourself. I have fought against coming here for six
years.



[Looks around.

What a queer place. I don't think I like it. [KARL crosses
C. and up laughing. Strange monsters, cut off heads, and
you in the middle of all this like a wizard. While my
husband was here I did not feel it, but now these heads
seem to stare at me.



[She shivers.

KARL

Don't be nervous       every woman I paint comes here.

OLGA, seated on couch, quietly

And do you paint every woman that comes here?

KARL

No.



[Silence.

OLGA

Did you understand my husband just now?

KARL

I think I did.

OLGA

He has often pretended to be jealous, but this time there
was a ring in his voice that made me feel that there was
something behind it.

KARL

You don't really think he's jealous?

OLGA, crosses to chair

No. But this is the first time I've been alone with you.

KARL

Now we can talk things over. I've wanted to for a long time.

OLGA, leans against R. back of chair

We've done well to avoid it all these years. A good
conscience is like a warm bath       one feels so comfortable in
it.

KARL

Last Thursday, when we spoke about my painting your
portrait, you seemed embarrassed.

OLGA, looks at him; their eyes meet

Don't let us talk about it. I don't want to.

KARL

Don't be afraid of me. If I were not I, your fear might be
justified; but as it is, surely we can trust ourselves to
talk things over quietly. To think that seven years ago I
was a teacher in Herman's family       and I was there the day
your engagement was announced       it was the evening of the
day we       

OLGA, puts her hand on his, softly reproaching him

Karl.

KARL

       We kissed each other for the first time. Oh, I know. I
was only a drawing teacher       but you       what were you? Just
a poor little friend of Herman's sisters. Sometimes you
were asked to tea in their grand house. And there we met       a
beggar boy and a beggar girl at the rich man's table. Do
you wonder? And then, just as we realized what we were to
each other, one fine day Herman up and proposed to you.
Such a dazzling offer       who could blame you?

OLGA, hurt

Please       please, Karl.

KARL

We were two poor little souls who found one another in the
wilderness of wealth       only to lose each other. Even the
memory of that one little kiss....

OLGA

Dear Karl, don't. We have grown up to be sensible
people       we have put it out of our thoughts.

KARL

Oh, I know it's all over. To-day I'm       (humorously) the
famous painter, your husband is my friend, and though we
see one another every day, we have never spoken of it
again. I wouldn't even have the courage to ask you to sit
for your portrait. I was afraid, and I think you were
afraid. And so was your husband. And that is why until this
day       

OLGA, steps down one pace from chair, gives him her hand

You are a real friend.

KARL, goes to her, gently

There's nothing to be afraid of.

OLGA

Oh, it was only my husband's voice       something in his manner
that frightened me. He must know what we were to one
another, though he has never made the slightest allusion
to it, not one single word in all these years. But when he
left us here alone, he seemed to feel       



[Breaks off.

But there is no reason for it, is there? We are not in love
with one another, are we? And it's just lovely to think
that we have not entirely forgotten old times. Don't you
think so, Karl?

KARL, goes to chair

Of course I do.

OLGA

Because if we still loved one another, you would not marry,
would you?



[Taking off gloves.

KARL

Of course not.

OLGA

So you will be married and you will be very, very
happy       and I shall be happy, too, because it is my own
idea, and I have picked out a nice girl for you       pretty and
clever       



[KARL bows silent acquiescence.

And now       



[Goes up and knocks on back of chair       business
of entering imaginary door, etc. She speaks in
an everyday voice, in marked contrast to former
tone.

How do you do, Professor? I have come to have my portrait
painted.

KARL, quite enthusiastic, R. C.

Last night I made a sketch of you from memory.... Oh, I've
made lots of sketches of you; but now, now I see you in
another light.

OLGA, R.

How do you mean?

KARL

Yesterday I looked upon you as a model. To-day you are a
motif       you are a revelation...? there is something in your
eyes....

OLGA

Please, please, Karl, we agreed that       that       

KARL

Pardon me, I'll try to remember.



[Goes up on platform.

OLGA

Let's go to work now       it's getting late.

KARL

Whenever you are ready       

OLGA

What am I to do?

KARL, steps behind her to take hat pins out of her hat

Take off your hat and your coat, please.

OLGA

Thanks, I can do that myself.



[She takes her hat and coat off. KARL takes her
coat up on platform.

KARL, passing her chair as he goes up

Do you use perfume in your hair?

OLGA

I? Never!



[At chair up in alcove.

KARL

Oh, then it is the natural perfume of your hair.



[She looks at him reproachfully.

Pardon me: I stood too near.



[Looks at her in silence. She crosses back
of large chair to couch L., and sits facing
audience.

OLGA, nervously, turns her head to him

What is it?

KARL, leaning against big chair, looking at her dress

I was just thinking       didn't your husband say an evening
frock?

OLGA

Yes. Herman wants me painted décolletée       in an evening
gown; just a head and shoulders, you know. I would have
preferred a street dress.

KARL

I'm afraid I agree with Herman on that point. But have
you?... Didn't you?... Where is the dress?

OLGA

Oh, I thought you would only be painting my face the first
sitting.

KARL, comes C., laughs

So you thought I began at the top of a portrait and painted
down?

OLGA, hesitating

Yes.

KARL

Why, the drawing of the shoulders is almost more important
than the head in the first sketch.

OLGA

Oh, dear. How stupid of me.

KARL, crossing L.

I'll tell you what       



[He selects some draperies from those hanging in
the corner.

I have some draperies here       

OLGA

Well       

KARL

You can arrange one of these around your shoulders
like       like an evening gown.

OLGA, mechanically

Yes.

KARL, hanging drapery on cabinet L.

You will have to be quick because it will soon be dark.
Here are the draperies       you'll find some pins over here,
and I'll go into the studio while you       until you       

[Goes to door of studio.

OLGA, seated

Until when? Why?

KARL

Why, if I'm to paint your shoulders       well       



[Turns away towards studio.

       your blouse?

OLGA, terribly embarrassed

Of course       

KARL

Do just as if you were at home. I'll close this door.



[Goes to door R. to entrance hall and locks it.

And now I'll go into the studio ... and you can lock this
door yourself.



[He has opened the door of the studio and has
made one step into studio, and now says in a low
tone:

Oh! It's snowing.



[He looks at Olga.

OLGA

Snowing?

KARL

Snowing hard.



[Silence.

OLGA

Hadn't we better?       perhaps       perhaps       tomorrow       or       or       



[She has been saying this very slowly, as if
afraid, but now suddenly regains confidence, as
if she had had a saving idea.

Tomorrow I could bring my maid.

KARL

Oh, no, no. Your husband would certainly want to know the
reason, and really       if this door is closed       



[He goes back to his studio.

It's too bad! This snow takes all the light away. But never
mind       never mind; the snow shovellers will be glad of it.



[He has spoken the last few sentences in a very
low voice, as if the situation was painful to
him. He goes backwards into the studio and now
closes the door. [OLGA is standing with her
back towards the studio, staring in front of her.
She now shrinks together, shivers, turns around.
Sudden resolution, she turns the key, locking
the door to the studio. Slowly unbuttons her
blouse, looks at the shawls, of which she chooses
one, afterwards takes her blouse off quietly,
putting the shawl around her shoulders. She has
put the blouse on the settee before she arranges
the shawl. She now picks up the blouse and wants
to put it on the chair in front of the fireplace;
her arm is already stretched out when she
suddenly drops the blouse, utters a suppressed
shriek, dropping blouse by chair, and crosses
quickly to foot of couch.

[The DEVIL, in fashionable frock coat, a
crimson carnation in buttonhole, a man of from
thirty-five to thirty-eight years old, resembling
in face classical Mephisto, very elegant, picks
up the blouse and offers to OLGA in a most
polite manner.

DEVIL

Pardon, Madame.



[Comes C. a little.

I think you dropped something.



[OLGA takes the blouse mechanically and looks at
him frightened.

I must beg your pardon, Madame. I came from lunch. Karl
was not at home. I waited and I fell asleep in this very
comfortable chair.



[He rubs his eyes.

Forgive me, Madame, for opening my eyes at a moment when,
for propriety's sake, I should have at least kept one eye
shut.

OLGA, puts blouse on couch and goes L., horrified and
disgusted

Oh!

DEVIL, Right of couch L.

I am aware this is a base insinuation       of course you only
come here       



[Ironical.

OLGA

To have my portrait painted.

DEVIL

I once had a similar encounter at a dentist's; and the
lady, to prove that my insinuations were false, did not
hesitate to sacrifice a perfectly good tooth.

OLGA

I tell you, I       

DEVIL, very polite

Oh, I know       you speak the truth. I am even at liberty to
believe it, though your truth is only partly in style.
Truth should have nothing on at all, you know.

OLGA

The insolence! What right have you to speak to me? Who are
you? What are you doing here? Karl!



[KARL tries door outside.

Karl!



[She opens the door of the studio, KARL
appears on the threshold and looks surprised at
the DEVIL.

DEVIL, crosses up R. C. very quickly

How do you do?

KARL, taken aback

How do you do?       er       how are you?

DEVIL, quickly

You don't seem to remember me       we met at Monte Carlo       

KARL, up L. C.

Oh, yes.

DEVIL

Quite an eventful day it was.

KARL, comes down a little

Yes, yes, I remember. It was last fall, and I had just lost
all my money at roulette. As I turned from the table, I
caught sight of a stranger frowning at me.



[Pointing to DEVIL.

It was you. I was startled, because only a moment before I
had seen you next to the croupier, and I thought I heard
you laugh when I lost. But now I remember       you stood behind
me, and when I had lost everything, you offered me, a total
stranger, a handful of louis d'or.

DEVIL

You refused       beggingly.

KARL

Yes, but       

DEVIL, continuing

You took them       protestingly.

KARL

In five minutes I had won everything back, and 20,000
francs besides. Your gold seemed to have magic power, I
remember. When you gave it to me it seemed to burn.

DEVIL

But you paid me back and invited me to supper. I had to
refuse, because I was obliged to leave for Spain the same
evening, but I promised to look you up the next time you
needed me       



[Crosses to R.

and here I am.

KARL

Well, I'll be       

DEVIL, interrupting quickly

Don't mention it. I took a little nap in your chair.



[Goes up to back of big chair.

OLGA, goes C., pointing to big chair. Frightened

It's very strange       this chair was empty; there was nobody
there.

DEVIL, stepping towards her, bowing; in a tone allowing no
contradiction

Then I was mistaken, Madame.



[OLGA goes over behind couch L. Silence.

[OLGA and KARL look at the DEVIL
suspiciously.

KARL, L. C., embarrassed

Won't you please sit down? Allow me to introduce you. I
quite forget your name....

DEVIL, R. C.

Call me anything you like: we only call names when the
party is absent; but I am here now       call me Miller, or
Brown, or Black.



[Start from KARL. DEVIL stops him.

If you think Doctor sounds better, why not call me Doctor
Miller?

KARL, very much embarrassed

Doctor Miller       



[Crosses to R. C. The DEVIL kisses OLGA'S
hand devoutly at foot of couch.

Under ordinary circumstances, I should now take my hat and
leave;



[Goes up C.; turns.

but my infinite tact compels me to force my presence upon
you in this disagreeable situation.

[Sits down in chair C.

OLGA, crossing to KARL; to the DEVIL

How dare you! Karl! This man has the insolence to       

DEVIL, seated C. Very quickly

Your husband has been dead some time?

OLGA, R.

I'm not a widow.

DEVIL, very quick

Oh, divorced?

OLGA

No.

DEVIL

Well, if you think that I have insulted you, I should say
the proper person to refer me to would be your husband.



[Rises; to KARL:

Of course, if you wish, I am at your disposal also.



[To OLGA:

But, Madame, this would be admitting       

KARL

What's it all about? I don't understand you. You come in
here, I don't know how or where from, and you       you act as
if you had trapped us       

OLGA, goes to KARL R. C.

The idea!

DEVIL

Say what you like: I cannot go.

OLGA

Why not?

DEVIL

If I were to go now, it would be as much as to say: "Pardon
me, I fear I intrude." But if I remain, I show that I
suspect nothing.

KARL

We don't need your assurance.



[OLGA crosses to L. below couch.

DEVIL, bows politely; embarrassing silence

Suppose we talk about something else. I think we are in for
a snowstorm.



[Standing R. of studio door. Silence.

[OLGA stands near the door leading to the
studio, quite astonished.

Are you sending anything to this year's exhibition?

KARL, uncomfortable

Perhaps       I may send something.



[Silence. The DEVIL lights a cigarette at
table L. C.

DEVIL, puffs cigarette. On second puff

Permit me, Madame.



[OLGA, picking up blouse, as if suddenly
awakened and realizing her position, goes into
the studio, closing the door behind her.

Full of temperament       full of temperament. And pretty, too.



[KARL starts to light cigarette at table L. C.

KARL, dropping cigarette, crosses to chair
up C., sits and looks at the DEVIL without
speaking

DEVIL

Too bad she doesn't love her husband.



[KARL turns quickly towards the DEVIL. Quick:

How do I know? The way she turned to you just now when she
fancied herself insulted       it didn't escape me.



[KARL takes up the ash tray and throws it
angrily on table.

No; she doesn't love her husband. He must be either a
genius or a very common man. Marriage with them is always
unlucky. Believe me, common men live so low that women are
afraid somebody will steal in at night through the window
which they forgot to lock. And Genius, well! That lives on
the top floor       so many stairs, no elevator. Her ideal is       



[A motion of the hand, wanting to express an
even, middle position.

       the second floor.



[KARL looks impatiently at his watch and goes
towards the door of the studio. The DEVIL
leans back blowing the smoke of his cigarette,
indifferently.

This is the second time I have seen her shoulders.

KARL, coming down left of couch

What do you mean?

DEVIL

The first time I saw them was in Paris       



[Start from KARL.

at the Louvre       only they were on the Aphrodite. Am I
right?

KARL, crossing to large chair R. C. In bad humor

How should I know?

DEVIL, lifting himself upright, cynically

Which shoulders have you not seen?

KARL, angry

I've seen the Aphrodite.

DEVIL, seated on couch

Well, you may take my word. I have seen them both. And,
believe me, since Alcamenes, I have only known one sculptor
who could model such shoulders.

KARL

Who's that?

DEVIL

Good living. Such tender, soft lines are only possible for
a woman who lives exquisitely well. I take it she is the
wife of a millionaire?



[KARL goes again towards door of studio
impatiently.

Is she dressing?

KARL, nervously

I suppose so.

DEVIL

Is there a looking-glass in your studio?

KARL, comes down L. of couch

Yes.

DEVIL

She must be very respectable.



[KARL looks at him astonished.

If a lady takes as long as that to dress before a
looking-glass, she's not a       model       anyway.

KARL, crosses around foot of couch to table L. C.

Look here! I think your remarks are, to say the least, in
very bad taste.

DEVIL, standing erect

Do you mean that?

KARL, aggressively

I do.

DEVIL, patting KARL'S cheek

Then you must be respectable, too.



[Crosses to big chair, KARL stares at him
astonished.

In a situation like this, only a very respectable man can
be so infernally stupid.



[KARL crosses to R. OLGA opens door of studio,
goes towards KARL without looking at the
DEVIL, who is hidden in chair.

OLGA, dropping shawl on couch

What's the time?



[Crosses to KARL, R.

DEVIL, looking up over back of chair

He'll be here in ten minutes.

OLGA, angry

Who?

DEVIL

Your husband.

OLGA

Oh! So you weren't asleep after all.

DEVIL

Oh, yes, I was.



[Rises.

But "What's the time?" always means the husband. A woman's
intuition invariably anticipates her husband's coming by
ten minutes. If it wasn't for that ten minutes, there would
be more divorced women       



[He goes and unlocks the door of the hall.

       and less locked doors.



[KARL crosses to L. C.

OLGA, taking her hat

Will this never stop!

DEVIL

I tried to change the subject. I started to speak about the
weather       the Exhibition       but Karl wouldn't have it.

OLGA

Karl!

KARL

I? I haven't said a single word.

DEVIL, crosses to big chair

But your actions fairly shouted. The way you jumped up,
looked at your watch, went to the door       



[To OLGA:

He was afraid, the poor fellow.

KARL

Afraid of what?



[L. C.

DEVIL, to OLGA

That your husband would come before you had finished
dressing. I don't blame him.

OLGA, R.

What, again!



[Goes up to hat.

KARL, L. C.

Can't you       

DEVIL

Come now! Let us be logical       let us look the situation in
the face. Enter your husband       



[OLGA comes down R.

"Well, here I am: where is the picture?" "The picture?"



[Shrugs his shoulders.

"There is no picture. Karl hasn't even touched a brush."
Your husband is astonished       he tries to speak       the words
stick in his throat       he gasps: "Well, if you didn't
paint, why is she dressing?" Imagine the situation! You
look at one another horribly embarrassed; Karl stammers
something, but that only makes it worse. Nothing has
happened       and yet the mischief is done. What mischief?
Appearances       appearances. They're like fly-paper. There's
no getting away from them.



[Speaking to OLGA:

You go home with your husband, and he doesn't speak       and if
you ask him: "Why don't you say something?" his blood seems
to boil. If you ask him to take a cab, he suspects that you
want to avoid meeting somebody       every word that you utter
tortures him. And if       

KARL, C.

And if it were so, we are not alone, you are here.

DEVIL, icy and cynical

Just so, I am here       one word from me would save the
situation       but       I know myself       I'm a strange, whimsical,
almost cruel man       and I'm afraid I won't say the word.
Tableau! Embarrassing silence! Then I say: "I regret that
I should have come at such an inopportune moment." I take
my hat and walk out discreetly. If necessary, I can even
stammer my excuses.

OLGA

If this is a jest, it's a cruel one.

DEVIL, bowing low

Possible, Madame       but I can do better still. Of course, if
you prefer it, I can make conversation       when your husband
comes in, I can tell him that the portrait has not been
touched and ask his pardon       

OLGA

Pardon? Pardon for what?

DEVIL, bowing For having       quite accidentally       seen your
shoulders.

OLGA, horrified

Who are you?

DEVIL

I am one who always comes at the right moment       I come from
Nowhere.



[Very bitingly.

I am here       



[Touching OLGA'S forehead.

OLGA

What do you want with me? You turn everything to evil. I
have scarcely known you five minutes, and I seem to feel
your fingers at my throat.

DEVIL

That's because I like you. With most pretty women I take
longer.

KARL, furiously, starts towards him

Look here: this has gone far enough!



[Makes a few steps towards the DEVIL, who
stands erect without moving. At the same time,
HEINRICH comes to the door, which he opens, and
starts speaking at once.

HEINRICH

The tailor has sent an evening suit, but it is not yours,
sir.

DEVIL

Put it on the chair in the bedroom.

KARL

But it's not mine.

DEVIL, gives a sign to HEINRICH to go out and do as he
was told. Speaking to KARL

It's mine.

KARL

Yours?

DEVIL, makes motion to HEINRICH, who goes out



[During speech OLGA goes up and gets her hat.
KARL walks back and forth L. C.

I had to have it pressed. I told the tailor to send it
here. I must dress for tonight. I'm going to a ball the
prettiest woman in Vienna is giving at the house of the
Duke of Maranse.

OLGA, coming down R., frightened

But the Duke does not live there now       he's Ambassador in
Madrid; he has sold his house       to us.

DEVIL

I know. I met him in Paris. He told me       

OLGA

We are living there now       we are giving the ball.

DEVIL

Am I mistaken? Am I not invited?

OLGA, in a very low voice, dropping her head

Yes       yes, you are.

DEVIL, very polite

Madame, you asked me a little while ago what I wanted.
That's what I wanted. Thank you.



[Bows and turns towards C. Silence.

OLGA

But my husband       

DEVIL, turning to her

Will be delighted. I've just come from Odessa. I have good
news. Wheat is rising       this year's crop turned out worse
than they thought it would.

OLGA, greatly pleased

Yes? The crop is bad?



[The DEVIL goes to big chair and kneels on it
L.

DEVIL

So you do love your husband? You're glad the crop is a
failure?

OLGA

Of course I am.



[As if she was somewhat ashamed about her
husband's speculations.

We want the wheat to be bad because that will drive the
price up.

KARL

What of that?

OLGA

My husband will make lots of money.

DEVIL, to OLGA

And you will get that new gown.

OLGA

How do you know I want a new dress?

DEVIL

You have a new hat       a very pretty one       and you will
certainly want a new dress to wear with it.

OLGA

You must be married.

DEVIL

Married? Not the least       but I have an eye for feminine
vanities. Oh, no! A wife is like a single eyeglass       it
looks very nice, but one is better off without it.

OLGA, R.

You seem to have strong views against marriage. May I ask
why?

DEVIL, shaking his finger

Because you are plotting matrimony against Karl, and I want
to save him.

KARL, starts toward him; stops C.

I beg your pardon       

DEVIL

An artist ought never to marry       his wife will swear on the
wedding day to stand by his side all through life. The day
after the wedding she will stand in his way.

OLGA

Not the real wife.

DEVIL

The real wife is always the other man's wife.

OLGA

You're a cynic.

DEVIL

Oh, no, not cynical, only careful. A tigress who has
married       I mean eaten       a man, is no longer dangerous       you
can ride on her back through the jungle. But, you must wait
till she has married       I mean eaten       somebody; then she is
quite safe.

KARL

Better to keep away from the tigress       and stay at home.

DEVIL

Then why didn't you stay at home P Why did you refuse
a legitimate position       good, everyday morals       a decent
occupation at so much a week? You wanted to go into the
jungle       and there you are. Now fight your battle       hunt
tigers       but don't get married!



[He now changes his tone, goes into the church
chair, on whose back he leans his two arms,
speaking as if from a pulpit. It is almost dark,
and during this scene it becomes darker yet.

And yet       what a splendid couple you two would make.



[OLGA, standing quite near the DEVIL but not
looking at him, buries her face in her hands.

Wake up!



[To KARL:

You, with your talent, your splendid youth!



[To OLGA:

You, with your temperament, and beauty and longing!

KARL crosses to R.

Stop! Stop! I beg you       



[OLGA backs to R. of back of chair, as though to
protect DEVIL.

       for years we have been just good friends.

DEVIL



[He now begins to speak in almost a whisper, but
getting warmer and warmer, the more embarrassed
KARL and OLGA become.

You may say what you like, but I can read your eyes; they
say to me: "Don't believe him, he lies."



[Goes to fire and warms his hands, KARL stands
below OLGA.

KARL

Don't interrupt me. For six years we have been        good
friends, nothing else. Olga cares nothing for me       and
I       and I       

DEVIL, quickly

What will you give me to interrupt you now?

OLGA

I don't know what you, who profess to know everything, know
about us, but anyone who thinks Karl capable of one base
thought must be very low and contemptible himself.

DEVIL



[Goes behind OLGA and whispers into her ear.
At the end of the speech he is a little to the L.
of them by the big chair.

It's not a base thought: it's a great thought       a thought
that brings joy and warmth and light into your wretched
little lives. But joy has its price       and you must pay it,
you misers! The drunkard dies of drink, but while he is
drunk angels in heaven sing to him. The poet dies in the
ecstasy of his sweetest song. It is a coward's bravery that
turns away from the wine, the song       and the lips of woman.
The smallest candle-end shows you it is worth while to burn
up for the sake of a little warmth       a little light. The
only end of life is to burn       to burn yourself up. You must
flame and blaze like a torch and toss the fire about you.
I know: your moralists tell you to love one another       don't
believe them       your grubby little earth with its paltry
million years is not ripe for such a love as that. It can
only breed monks, madmen, Methodists. Don't be a fool, be
a rogue       but be a jolly rogue       and the world is yours!
Look at me! I own the earth. Here is the key of life       Love
yourself       only yourself. Dress yourself in the softest
garments       kiss the sweetest lips       drink of the wine of
Life       Drink! Drink! Drink!



[Bell rings sharply       nobody moves.

OLGA, after a pause, in a low voice

My husband       

DEVIL



[Steps down from the chair, crossing C., snaps
his fingers angrily, and says afterwards, in a
cold, cynical tone:

Mr. Wheat.



[HEINRICH opens the door, and HERMAN comes
in. HEINRICH follows him, but stops short at
the door.

HERMAN

I'm afraid I'm late. My agent hasn't telephoned me yet, but
I didn't want to make you wait too long. Rather dark in
here!



[HEINRICH touches a button, lighting the lights,
and exits.

HERMAN, sees the DEVIL, presenting himself

I'm Herman Zanden, of Zanden Brothers       Wilde.



[DEVIL mutters something and shakes hands with
him C.

OLGA, coming down R. KARL goes behind big chair

Strange man.

HERMAN

Pleased to meet you.



[Converses with KARL a few moments; then to
OLGA:

Well, my dear, where's the picture? Mayn't I see it?

KARL, in the big chair, leaning over back

There's nothing to see       there is no picture.

HERMAN, looking at his watch

What have you been doing?

KARL

Nothing. (Silence.) It's been dark for the last hour.

HERMAN

Yes, but I've been gone two hours.

DEVIL, steps to the front L. C. very politely

It was all my fault. We have been chatting. We've had a
very interesting discussion. And Madame was kind enough to
invite me for this evening.

HERMAN

Oh! I'm very pleased.

DEVIL, crosses to couch L. and sits

Thank you. I have just come from Odessa. I had a talk with
the Russian Wheat King. He tells me       

HERMAN

Yes, I've heard; wheat's going up.

OLGA, frightened

Isn't that good for us?

HERMAN

No, dear. I did not tell you this is the first year I am
short on wheat.

KARL

What does it mean to be short on wheat?

DEVIL, seated on couch L.

It means digging a ditch for others and falling into it
yourself.



[To HERMAN:

I don't think you've any cause for uneasiness. I have
inside information that the American crop will be excellent.

HERMAN, C.

If that is the case, I shall be safe.

DEVIL

You will be quite safe.

HERMAN

Do you also deal in wheat?

DEVIL

Yes and no. I dabble in everything. And always at improper
moments. (Rises.)

KARL, has been talking to OLGA, but now goes over to
HERMAN

I'm afraid I can't come before eleven o'clock this evening.



[Continues talking to HERMAN, and both go to
fire.

OLGA, crosses and meets DEVIL, C.

I must speak to you at once       alone.



[Looks around as if she wanted to say that her
husband and KARL were in the way.

DEVIL

Alone? Delighted!



[Crosses by her and goes up C. OLGA goes
behind couch and DEVIL addresses HERMAN.

By the way, if you want to see something delightfully bad,
you ought to take a look at the sketch Karl made yesterday
of your wife.

HERMAN, coming down

Where is the sketch?

DEVIL

In the studio.



[HERMAN takes KARL'S arm and walks to door of
the studio; in going into the studio speaks to
KARL.

HERMAN

I'm sorry you didn't start Olga's portrait today. What were
you talking about all the time?



[Goes into studio.

DEVIL, to OLGA

I'll wait for you here.



[He steps back into the room just in time to
see MIMI enter from the hall.

MIMI, comes right in, crossing to C. Excuse me       

DEVIL

You want to see the painter?

MIMI, excited

Yes, please.

DEVIL, very gently, pushing MIMI out of the door into
the hall and speaking through the door

One minute, my dear. There are some visitors here. Sit down
there. I'll call you.

OLGA, comes quickly from the studio

I wanted to tell you       to tell you       

DEVIL, R. C.

It is not true.

OLGA

What is not true?

DEVIL

Whatever you are going to tell me.

OLGA

But believe me.

DEVIL

Surely no woman can expect that.

OLGA

But I am telling you the truth.

DEVIL

Ah! I might believe you if you said you were not speaking
the truth.

OLGA

Must I think and speak only as you wish me to?

DEVIL

Not yet. Now what can I do for you?

OLGA, very earnestly L. C.

Don't come tonight. Now my husband has come, I am myself
again, and your manner grates upon me. I had begun to
feel as if some strange force       some invisible hand       was
clutching me        holding me in spite of myself. There is a
mystery about you. It frightens me. I thanked God when I
heard that bell ring. He came just in time.

DEVIL

To point a moral and break up a charming party. We were
just beginning to understand each other.

OLGA

Oh please stop!

DEVIL

Are you afraid?

OLGA

No, but I ask you not to come to our house this evening.

DEVIL, with a very polite bow, then drawing himself up

I shall come.

OLGA

And if my husband asks you not to come?

DEVIL

Your husband has already asked me to come.

OLGA

And if, in the presence of my husband, I ask you not to
come?

DEVIL

Well, I'll make a compromise with you. If you repeat your
invitation in your husband's presence, I shall accept; if
you do not, I will not come.

OLGA, breathing freely

That's nice of you       the first really nice thing you've
said. I like you much better.



[KARL and HERMAN come back from the studio, and
HERMAN starts to talk at once to the DEVIL, KARL
goes toward OLGA, who meets KARL up C.

OLGA, to HERMAN

Shall we go?

HERMAN

Yes, dear; put your coat on.



[Comes down L. DEVIL crosses to HERMAN.

KARL, meets OLGA, they go up to recess. He helps OLGA
to put her coat on.

I see now how bad the sketch is.



[Holds mirror for OLGA while she puts her hat
on.

OLGA

Please don't look at me like that.

KARL

Even if I don't look at you, I see you just the same, Olga.

OLGA, covering her face with her hand

We must give up the portrait, Karl ... I'm going away ...
away somewhere.

DEVIL, L., with HERMAN.

You don't say? You represent Holman       Co. in London? When I
am in Odessa I am always old Mr. Holman's guest. A charming
old gentleman. No doubt you have heard the rumors. It seems
they've been mixed up with some unfortunate ventures which
have seriously affected their standing.

HERMAN, seated on couch

Strange! Another friend of mine spoke to me about it only
yesterday.

DEVIL

Yes, but that isn't all. He's the president of some trust
company, and in order to boom the stocks he       but it's a
long story, I won't bore you with it now.



[Makes as if he wanted to go.

HERMAN

My dear sir, this concerns me more than I can tell you. The
fact is       I       I am heavily interested.



[OLGA has her hat on and turns, listening to
HERMAN and the DEVIL.

DEVIL

You don't say. But it's a long story.

HERMAN

Well, then       tonight.

DEVIL

Oh, I am so sorry. I have excused myself already to Madame,
but I had forgotten all about a call I must pay at the
Russian Embassy this evening.

HERMAN

Well, lunch with me tomorrow?

DEVIL, with a gesture of regret

I'm afraid it will be impossible. I leave tomorrow at nine
o'clock for       Spain.

HERMAN, to himself

H'm! I must have this information.



[HERMAN crosses to C., speaking to his wife


My dear, won't you please ask the Doctor to try and arrange
to come to our house this evening?

OLGA, somewhat embarrassed

Well, but if pressing business....

DEVIL, L. C.

It is not so very pressing. Of course, it would mean a
little sacrifice.

HERMAN, C., looking at OLGA

Well       

OLGA, R. C.

Much as I would like to see you, Doctor, I cannot ask you
to sacrifice anything for our sake.

DEVIL, as if suddenly remembering something

Come to think of it, the Russian Ambassador left town
yesterday, so if Madame       

HERMAN, goes up C. DEVIL crosses to her R. C.

Well, my dear?

OLGA, in a tone of resignation

I hope we shall have the pleasure this evening       

DEVIL, crosses to OLGA

Pardon me. You said       

OLGA, very slowly

I hope we shall have the pleasure of your company this
evening?



[Goes to door R.

DEVIL, ironically

Madame, I thank you for your invitation; I shall be most
charmed.

HERMAN, coming down to KARL

And you don't come before eleven?

KARL, by big chair

No; I expect an art dealer.

HERMAN, suggestively

I know your art dealers. Fie! And you going to be married.

OLGA, curiously, and a bit jealous

What is it?

KARL

Oh, nothing.

DEVIL, up C. as if listening

I think somebody knocked at the door.

HERMAN

I didn't hear anything.

DEVIL

Yes, there it goes again.



[Cynically.

Probably the art dealer.



[Goes to hall door, which he opens, steps out,
speaking into the hall.

Oh, it's you, my dear. Come in.


[Swings MIMI into
room past OLGA, landing her C.


MIMI, as she comes in embarrassed

Good evening.



[HEINRICH enters from studio.

KARL, up C. embarrassed

Good evening.



[MIMI goes up L.

DEVIL, R. C., in a low tone to HERMAN

We'd better go.



[MIMI and OLGA stare at one another.

[Cynically to HERMAN:

The Art Dealer!

HERMAN, laughing, going to door

Well, au revoir.



[Exit.

DEVIL, to OLGA

Quite a little comedy.

OLGA, at door R.

You think so?

KARL, to MIMI, pointing to the studio

Please step in there, Fräulein; I'll be with you in a
minute.



[KARL turns to OLGA with hand out-stretched,
as if to say good-bye. OLGA pretends not to see
it and bows coldly.

DEVIL, whispers to OLGA

You were good enough to invite me for this evening: I am
now going to repay your kindness. In five minutes I shall
be back here to interrupt this tête-à-tête. Watch me forget
my overcoat.



[He takes the overcoat which KARL had put on
a chair at the beginning of the act when he came
in. HEINRICH helps the DEVIL to put on the
overcoat, but notices that it is his master's.

HEINRICH

Pardon, sir; but this is not your overcoat. This       

DEVIL, aside to HEINRICH

Shut up!



[DEVIL goes off; HEINRICH follows him out.

KARL, comes C. to MIMI

Didn't I promise you I'd come? What do you want?

MIMI, coming to him

Were you ashamed to have those people see me?

KARL

I told you, I'd come. What more do you want?

MIMI

I was downstairs in the lunch room and thought it all over.
Dear Karl, don't be mean       don't get married.

KARL

But       Mimi!

MIMI

I never used to care, but now that I've seen those people
I       I can't bear it. Don't get married!



[Cries.

KARL

You mustn't cry       it spoils your beauty.

MIMI

Oh, I'm a fool.

KARL

Now, you're talking sense.

MIMI

I've been a silly girl       but it's all over now. I'm sensible
again. You are going to settle down and marry Elsa and be
the most famous portrait painter in all Europe.

KARL

Mimi, child       don't speak of portraits. I feel at this
moment as if I never wanted to hear the
word portrait again. I'd like to run away from everything,
Mimi. What do you say?




Mimi and Karl





[Goes to couch L. and sits.

Suppose you and I get married and go away       far away into
the country       or to the United States, where we'd never be
heard of again.

MIMI, kneels beside him

Do you mean that?

KARL, recklessly

Yes       yes!

MIMI, gives him her hand

That's mighty nice of you, Karl.



[Rises, goes L. C.

But no! even if you really mean it       which you don't       



[Makes an effort to control herself.

KARL, interrupting

Mimi!

MIMI

No, Karl; I'd only keep you back       you must marry in your
own set.



[Changes tone.

But don't run away       with       with anybody. Good-bye.              -

KARL

No, don't go! Now you have come, you might as well stay a
while       take your hat off.



[Helps her off with her hat and jacket.

I'm glad you came back. Now, let's be sensible       and talk
it over. You know I really am fond of you       after all, I am
your best friend and you are my       my       



[The DEVIL has silently opened the door and
comes in.

DEVIL

My       my overcoat must be somewhere. Your stupid servant gave
me yours.



[Takes coat off.

It's funny, but every time I come here, you are helping
some lady to take off her things.



[MIMI goes to couch.

MIMI, horrified

Well, I never.



[Exit.

DEVIL

You have every qualification for a ladies' tailor.

KARL

You are very kind.

DEVIL

Don't mention it.

KARL, impolitely

I'll fetch your overcoat; I don't want to detain you.



[Puts out lights and goes towards studio.

DEVIL

The hanger was torn off. I asked your man to mend it and
bring it here when it was done.



[Sits up C. Silence.

I just saw something very touching.

KARL

What?



[Goes to C. and sits on arm of chair by DEVIL.

DEVIL

The way that woman clung to her husband's arm as if for
protection.

KARL

For protection? (Sneeringly.) From you?

DEVIL

Look here, my boy; do you think you are wise to be such a
fool?



[KARL rises, starts away, DEVIL catches him by
hand.

KARL

I don't want to talk about it. You don't seem to understand
my position. I have seen this woman for years every day,
and I never even thought       and if I had thought       I should
have laughed at myself.

DEVIL, rises, takes both KARL'S hands

Look at her! She's yours. Think what it means        joy,
unspeakable joy       the most supreme joy one can have. And to
think that you are too lazy to stretch out your hand! Why,
another one would toil day and night, would risk life and
limb for such a prize       and it just drops at your feet       a
windfall.

KARL

I suppose that's why       



[In a tone as if he didn't think much of it.

       just a windfall.



[Sits on couch.

DEVIL, sits on table L. C.

Last fall, on the sixth of September       I shall never forget
the date       something strange happened to me. I put on an old
suit I hadn't worn for a long time, and as I picked up the
waistcoat, a sovereign fell out. God knows how long it had
been there. As I turned this sovereign over to look at it,
it suddenly slipped through my fingers and rolled away.
I looked and looked, but my sovereign was gone. I become
nervous: I can't find the sovereign. I search around for
half an hour, three quarters of an hour, still I can't find
it. I get angry, I get furious. I shift the furniture       no
sovereign. I call my man       we both look everywhere until
it's dark. I'm perspiring and trembling       I have but one
idea: I must get that sovereign back. Suddenly a suspicion
comes into my mind       I get up from my knees. I scream at the
top of my voice to my servant: "You thief, you have found
the sovereign and put it into your pocket." The man gets
angry and answers me disrespectfully. I am about to strike
him when I see the blade of a knife shining in his hands. I
draw my revolver       



[Takes a shining revolver out of his pocket and
rises.

       and with this revolver I nearly killed a man for a
sovereign       



[Look from KARL.

       I didn't need and had never missed       just a found
sovereign.



[Puts revolver on table.

KARL, embarrassed

I give found money away.



[Turns on couch from him.

DEVIL

I would have given it away, but       it slipped through my
fingers, and whatever slips through our fingers, that is
just the one thing we want.



[Goes to KARL.

We break our necks for it: that's human nature. And if it
once slips through your fingers, you will run after your
found sovereign. And then, when it is too late, you will
discover it was worth having.

KARL

To draw a revolver for a found sovereign?

DEVIL, sitting by him

And that little woman will become dearer and more precious
to you every day       you will realize that she could have
given you wings       that her temperament, her beauty, her
passion, would have been the inspiration of your work        all
this you'll realize when she has slipped away. You could
have become a master       a giant! Not by loving your art,
but by loving her       but you won't know it till it is too
late       too late.



[He now takes the shawl with which OLGA had
draped her shoulders.

This shawl has touched her bosom       



[Throws one end over KARL'S shoulder, forcing
him to see it. KARL clasps the shawl and
touches his lips to it.

Think what you might have been to one another! What divine
happiness, not because she is beautiful       no, but because
you       

KARL, throws shawl L. of couch

Be quiet! Be quiet! Do you want to drive me mad?

DEVIL, rises and goes to head of couch

A life that has not been squandered       has not been lived       

KARL

Why do you tell me all this? Why? What do you want?



[Throws himself face down on couch.

What do you want?



[Horrified, turns to him.

Who sent you?

DEVIL, darkly

Nobody! No one! I am here.



[Touches KARL'S forehead.

KARL

No! And a thousand times no.



[Throws himself face down again on couch.
Screams very loud.

No! Do you hear me? No! I have known her all these years,
and we've been good friends only       and we'll remain good
friends, nothing else. I don't want the found sovereign!



[Moving to end of couch.

DEVIL, coming down L. of couch; very emphatically

And if it slips away?



[Silence. Then quickly:

If another man runs away with it       ?

KARL, suddenly jumping at a conclusion

Who?



[Looks at the DEVIL.

DEVIL, triumphant

I. (Silence.)

KARL

You?



[Laughs and turns from him.

DEVIL

Tonight! This very night she'll be mine!



[Laughs.

Oh, what joy! What exquisite joy. For ten thousand years I
have had no prettier mistress!

KARL, turning to him

What do you say?

DEVIL, sitting L. head of couch

Mistress, I said. Come tonight       to her house       when the
lights are burning       when the air seems to be filled with
music and perfume. You'll see       before day dawns.

KARL

Enough! Enough!

DEVIL

How you will run after your lost sovereign! Every hour when
you wonder where she is, she spends with me. A carriage
passes: your heart stands still. Who's in that carriage?
Shall I tell you? We! You see a couple vanish around a
corner, clinging lovingly to one another. Who were they?
We! Always we. A light goes out in some window. Who put
that light out? We! We sit in every carriage, we vanish
around every corner       clinging lovingly together; we stand
behind every window curtain in close embrace, looking
into your tortured face, your maddened eyes       and we cling
closer       closer       and we laugh       -we laugh!



[Laughs long.

KARL



[Throws himself face down, back to audience, on
couch, in terrible state of excitement, screaming
at top of his voice:

You fiend!



[Reaches for revolver with R. hand. DEVIL
grabs his hand and holds revolver. KARL
draws away and sits staring straight ahead,
DEVIL rises, leaves revolver on table, lights
cigarette, then comes below table.

[HEINRICH enters the room noiselessly, carrying
a lighted candle, goes behind the DEVIL and helps
him to put his fur coat on.

[DEVIL puts his silk hat on, gives a tip to
HEINRICH, takes up the revolver, puts it into
his pocket, and says to KARL with a sad smile,
in a warm tone like a father speaking to his son:

DEVIL

You see, my boy, one may draw a revolver for a lost
sovereign.



[Goes to the door. As he opens the door, a look
of devilish satisfaction comes into his eyes.

CURTAIN


ACT II


SCENE.       A conservatory in Zanden's house. The L. side of
the stage as well as the whole back of the stage is taken
up by large bay windows, through which one sees into the
garden. In the distance the wall surrounding the house, and
some trees in the garden. It is winter. Bright weather,
but it has been snowing. In the garden as well as in the
street, electric lamps. On the R. side of the stage there
are two doors, one quite near to the footlights, leading
into the apartment       one in the rear, leading to the hall.
There is a platform about two yards long and two yards
wide, between these two doors. Five steps lead from this
platform towards the footlights, and five steps on the
side of the platform to the middle of the stage. On the
top of the platform a door leading to the ball-room. When
this door is opened, one generally hears the ball music.
At the foot of the stairs, about three yards from the
footlights, two square columns having a brass ornament with
eight electric lamps attached. There are heaps of plants
and flowers about the room. Two chairs and a table stand
on the R. side of the stage, about three yards from the
footlights, two chairs and a table on the L. side of the
stage, about five yards from the footlights. There are two
settees, L. and R. On the table L. writing material. It is
about one o'clock at night.



[Guests in fancy costumes are moving about as
the Curtain goes up.

FIRST LADY GUEST, sitting L. of table R.

Who is the dark man you left so suddenly in the ball room?

SECOND LADY GUEST, enters and comes down stairs to back of
table L.

I don't know his name.

FIRST LADY GUEST

A most disagreeable man.

SECOND LADY GUEST, crosses to group L. C.

Oh, dreadful! He behaved shockingly to my husband. He told
him that it will be so cold tonight that his teeth will
shiver in their box.

FIRST LADY GUEST

Olga tells me he is a friend of Herr Karl's, and she only
invited him as a compliment to him.

SECOND LADY GUEST (stout)

He insisted on telling me of a remedy for obesity. I don't
consider myself stout       do you?

ELSA, C., laughingly

No! I think I'm just right. He sounds interesting       I'd like
to meet him.

FIRST LADY GUEST

You'll be sorry if you do.

ELSA

Oh, indeed.

SECOND LADY GUEST

He'll be very disagreeable, I assure you.

ELSA

I'm not afraid of him.



[Wants to go up steps.

FIRST GENTLEMAN GUEST, L. C.

Miss Elsa, I really think you had better not.

SECOND LADY GUEST

If Miss Elsa wants to speak to him let her do so. I think
she is the only one really capable of putting him in his
place.

THIRD LADY GUEST, seated L. of table R.

Oh, she'll make him sit up.

ELSA

Thanks, awfully. Oh, I know what you call me       the
blue-stocking       sassy Elsa       

SECOND LADY GUEST

Elsa, I never said you were a blue-stocking.

FIRST LADY GUEST

I never called you Sassy Elsa.

ELSA

But I am       you know I am       



[Pointing at herself.

That's why nobody dares to tell me how to get thin.

SECOND LADY GUEST

The impertinence!

ELSA

Well       you asked for it.

SECOND LADY GUEST, to FIRST LADY GUEST

It will serve her right if       

ELSA, on the stairs

I'd just like to see him       



[The DEVIL is standing in front of her.
Everybody is silent.

DEVIL, in evening dress, red carnation in buttonhole;
after some silence

I never dreamed how quiet it could be when seven ladies are
not talking.



[Protesting movement on the part of the GUESTS.

Oh, I know       you have been very merciful to me in my absence.

ELSA, on stairs

You needn't think I am afraid to say what I think to your
face. I was just about to       



[She makes a movement showing that she wanted to
look for him.

DEVIL

You did well to stay. They would have said much worse
things about you       they would have spoken about your
approaching engagement to Karl.

ELSA

What!



[Astonished.

You know?

DEVIL

To my friend Karl       they want to throw you into his arms.



[The OTHERS laugh.

[In a low voice to ELSA:

I'd like to speak to you       alone.

ELSA

Here?



[Gesture that she thinks this impossible in a
crowded room.

DEVIL

We'll be alone in no time.



[ELSA goes to sofa and sits L. of table L.

FOURTH LADY GUEST, crosses to him; to DEVIL

I'm very glad you spoke that way to Elsa. You have quite
won me over, and I don't mind telling you I came very near
having to pick a bone with you.

DEVIL, R. C., to FOURTH LADY GUEST, who is very
thin       looking at her from head to foot

By the way, speaking of bones       

FOURTH LADY GUEST

What! Again!       oh!



[Walks off highly offended.

FIRST GENTLEMAN GUEST, very effeminate, smiling to the
DEVIL

Bravo! I couldn't do that       not that I lack courage. I am
famous for my courage       I just love a fight       I once slapped
the face of an athlete who dared to insult a lady.

DEVIL

You coward!

FIRST GENTLEMAN GUEST

What       coward?

DEVIL

Yes, coward. If you dared to slap the face of a cripple I
might admire your courage.



[FIRST GENTLEMAN GUEST starts to answer, but
afterwards makes a gesture seeming to say nothing
can be done with the DEVIL       going off slowly up
the stairs.

SECOND GENTLEMAN GUEST, after a few seconds talking
quietly to the DEVIL

Oh-h-h! You are a free-thinker. So am I!

DEVIL, as if astonished

You think?

SECOND GENTLEMAN GUEST

I do.

DEVIL

What with?



[Exit SECOND GENTLEMAN GUEST, angrily.

[To SECOND LADY GUEST, the stout one, seated
R. of table L.

A pity you don't dance       there's nothing like it for
reducing the figure.



[SECOND LADY GUEST rushes of.

DEVIL, L. to the THIRD LADY GUEST, pointing at FOURTH

Her husband must be in the furniture business.

THIRD LADY GUEST

Yes, who told you?

DEVIL

Her dress       it is the very latest pattern for arm-chairs and
settees       but please don't say I said so.

THIRD LADY GUEST, smiling

Certainly not.



[Goes to chair of FIRST LADY GUEST.

Jane       

DEVIL, joins ELSA. To ELSA

Look       she's telling her.

THIRD LADY GUEST, to FIRST LADY GUEST

But promise me not to be angry.

DEVIL

She promises.

FIRST LADY GUEST

I promise.

THIRD LADY GUEST

He said that       

DEVIL

Look out for the explosion.

FIRST LADY GUEST, rises

Oh, I never       

DEVIL

Now       watch her go.

FIRST LADY GUEST

I never!



[Goes off over the staircase.

THIRD LADY GUEST, going after her

But, Jane, you promised me       



[Exit.

DEVIL

Voilà! I am now at your disposal.

ELSA, on settee L.

Aren't you surprised I haven't gone? You insulted me, too.
I only stay because I want to speak to you.

DEVIL, L. C., ironically

Charmed, I'm sure.

ELSA

Oh, don't try to be polite       just be yourself. I'm not
afraid of you.

DEVIL

I know it.

ELSA, crosses up to C.

Perhaps you know my nickname       Saucy Elsa?



[DEVIL nods his head.

DEVIL

Yes.

ELSA

Politeness would only embarrass me       and I have chosen you
to deliver a message to that crowd        only because you can
be so delightfully rude.

DEVIL

I am at your entire disposal.

ELSA

Now, how can I be saucy when you talk like that?

DEVIL

I am your devoted servant.

ELSA

You're impossible.

DEVIL

Shall we end this conference?



[DEVIL starts up C.

ELSA, goes to table R. C. and leans against it

Not yet, please. You informed me just now that I am the
girl they want to throw into the arms of your friend Karl.

DEVIL

Yes.

ELSA

You forget to say I am the girl who allows herself to be
thrown in your friend's arms. Is that right?

DEVIL

Yes.

ELSA, stands and pushes forward chair Please sit down.



[DEVIL bows, but remains standing.

ELSA, in a very loud voice. Crosses and sits

Please sit down. I don't ask you out of politeness, but
because I want to set you right in this matter       and it is
much easier for me to set you right when you sit down and
I stand up. I don't want people to make fun of me       I know
what they say       do you understand me?

DEVIL, gets up

I do.

ELSA

Sit down, please. (He does so.) I don't want people to
smile and congratulate me to my face, and laugh behind my
back. I won't have it       and as you started this subject I
shall entrust you with the mission of enlightening our
friends out there.

DEVIL

Your confidence honors me.

ELSA

Don't think for a moment that I have taken these people
seriously       I have no more interest in them than I have for
yesterday's newspaper. But I don't choose to have them
think that they have fooled me into marrying Karl. And       

DEVIL, starts to rise. She stops him

Pardon me.

ELSA

I see through their scheme. But I shall marry him just the
same, if he will have me. Do you understand me? I shall
marry him       

DEVIL

Pardon me. I don't think you will.

ELSA

You will see.

DEVIL

You have been kind enough to honor me with your confidence,
and now I will be quite frank with you. This marriage
cannot come off.



[Stands up.

ELSA, points to chair

Please sit down.

DEVIL, takes her hands and swings her into chair

No! You will sit down now because I am going to set you
right. I know the reason of this marriage       but you       



[A MAN SERVANT crosses stage; DEVIL calls him.

You will find in my overcoat a small leather satchel       bring
it here.



[MAN SERVANT goes off.

[Continuing to ELSA:

But you don't know the reason       or you don't want to know
it. And you are about to consent to       

ELSA, interrupting

To what? To marry a man who is not madly in love with
me       any more than I am with him. What of it? We are two
perfectly sane people about to make a serious contract with
our eyes wide open, instead of blinded by infatuation like
crazy lovers in magazine stories. What other contract made
by crazy people would be valid for one minute       and this is
for a life-time       



[Enter SERVANT and hands bag to DEVIL and exits.

DEVIL, smiling

True       for a lifetime.

ELSA

You are a man of the world?

DEVIL, gravely

Of many worlds.

ELSA



[Looks up quickly as if about to ask the DEVIL
what he means, but checks herself and continues:

Well, in this world       is it the man chooses the woman, or
the woman who chooses the man?

DEVIL, smiling

We are the weaker sex.

ELSA

Answer me! Which chooses?

DEVIL

The man sometimes chooses the engagement ring       

ELSA, holding up her head proudly, and looking her very
prettiest, straight into his eyes

Look at me, please.



[The DEVIL looks into her eyes.

ELSA, proudly

Now tell me, can I or can I not choose the man I will marry?

DEVIL, leaning on table R., in a courtly manner

It is written in your eyes       but       I never thought this
subject would excite you so.

ELSA, seated L. of him, with animation

I won't be laughed at       I don't care what those people think
(becoming excited). I know what I am doing, and in spite
of everything I choose to become his wife.

DEVIL, takes out little red satchel and opens it

Why?

ELSA, beginning to lose control of herself

Because       because       



[Breaks down.

       because I love him.



[Begins to sob bitterly.

DEVIL

Allow me       



[Takes a little handkerchief out of the satchel
and gives it to her.

I always carry this with me       it's my weeping
satchel       everything a woman needs for weeping.

ELSA, weeps a little harder; sobbing, wiping her eyes with
the handkerchief

I love him.



[During the following dialogue the DEVIL
takes out of the weeping satchel a little
looking-glass, small comb, powder and puff, and
gives her one after another.

DEVIL

And this is Saucy Elsa!

ELSA

No. Until tonight I was a young girl afraid of nobody       now
I feel like an old woman.



[Takes mirror.

What am I to do?



[Looks, smiles quickly.

DEVIL

Don't be discouraged. You will have to fight       you must
attack the enemy. But first you must be pretty.

ELSA, takes puff and powder from him

I shall try to.



[Reaches out for it.

DEVIL

You must show a bold front       you will perhaps feel that it
is hard for a young girl to fight a woman       your weapons are
not quite so numerous as those of the married woman       who
knows love already       who understands       may I say something
shocking?



[During this speech ELSA hands back or
the DEVIL takes all the articles except the
handkerchief.

ELSA, looks at him, opening her eyes widely

Do you ever say anything that isn't?



[Gives him handkerchief, rises.

DEVIL

Well, I won't. But remember, you have one weapon which will
deal the death blow to the most attractive woman       to the
woman who knows every card in the game of love       that one
weapon is purity.

ELSA

This sounds strange from you!

DEVIL

All the same       it may do you some good. And now       go dance
with Karl       but don't try to be a woman, be a girl. Don't
try to be saucy.

ELSA, L. C.

I'm not really saucy       I'm afraid it's only a pose       

DEVIL

Don't pose. Be yourself       be bashful       look at the young
man as if you were only waiting for a pirate to steal you
away from girl-land       and show you the way into Woman's
Land. Head high, my little girl       -that's it       and if anybody
dares to call you saucy again, tell him that you once met a
gentleman at a ball to whom you thought to give a piece of
your mind, that would make him feel very, very small       and
instead you left with a piece of his mind, that made you
feel very, very small       and made him feel       as if he were the
greatest Scoundrel in the world       



[Taking a few steps to the footlights.

which perhaps he is.



[ELSA goes up the stairs, when KARL appears
on the top of the stairs, DEVIL is standing at
this moment behind one of the columns unseen
by KARL       but quite near ELSA. ELSA turns
towards the DEVIL, showing her back to KARL.




Elsa and Karl



ELSA

So you don't want me to be saucy?

DEVIL, whispering

No.



[ELSA goes up one step.

KARL, on top step

Oh, Elsa, there you are!

ELSA, dropping her eyelids

Yes.

KARL

Why aren't you in the ball-room?

ELSA

I wanted to be alone. If anybody wants me he can find me.



[To DEVIL, whispers:

Is that better?

KARL

You look sad. Are you worried?

DEVIL, whispering to ELSA

Say no.

ELSA, leaning against pillar R.

No.

KARL, coming down

What has happened?



[Sees the DEVIL, DEVIL comes from behind
pillar between them, meets KARL on lower step.

Oh, I understand       

DEVIL, finishing KARL'S sentence

       nothing.



[Goes up stairs.

KARL, nearing ELSA

You look lovely, Elsa. Do you know, this pensive air
is very becoming to you       you've always been so cold
and       haughty       it's like finding a little white flower under
the deep snow; you want to pick it up and kiss it       



[Takes both of ELSA'S hands in his.

This is the Elsa for me!

ELSA, ashamed

Karl!

DEVIL

You will excuse me. I must pay my respects to our hostess.



[He goes off quickly. KARL and ELSA sit down
on the L. side of the stage.

ELSA

I don't like that man. Who is he?



[Sits R. of table L.

KARL, sits on sofa L.

A casual acquaintance who insists upon posing as my
friend. Don't let us talk about him. I'm glad I found
you here       something natural in this stifling artificial
atmosphere. Doesn't it seem close to you?

ELSA

Yes, as if some hot wind had passed through these rooms       it
seems to take my breath away.

KARL

I've never heard you speak like that before. Why have you
tried to hide       your real self from me?



[DEVIL appears on the platform, with OLGA.
They come down the steps.

OLGA

Hadn't we better leave the young couple alone?

DEVIL

You are much too considerate.

ELSA, to KARL

Olga       I suppose you'd like to speak to her?

KARL

I much prefer to talk to you.



[They continue talking.

[DEVIL and OLGA come down. She sits on sofa R.,
DEVIL in chair R.

OLGA

They seem to have found each other.

DEVIL

Possibly. Are you sorry?

OLGA

Oh, no.

DEVIL

Shall we leave?

OLGA

No, I like to see my plan bearing fruit.



[They continue speaking slowly.

ELSA

They are speaking about us.

KARL

What do we care? Let's be happy       Elsa! I feel as if I had
never known you before tonight.

ELSA, moves chair so she can hide OLGA from KARL. DEVIL
repeats business

Why do you keep looking over there?

KARL

Oh, that's only       I was quite unconscious       



[They continue speaking slowly.

OLGA

Let's talk about something else. You are very naughty. You
have come here in spite of my       

DEVIL, smiling

Invitation. I would have respected your wish but for one
very good reason       I made a bold wager this afternoon.

OLGA

What?

DEVIL

I made a bet that you would fall in love with me this
evening.

OLGA

Made a bet that I would fall in love with you? And with
whom did you bet?

DEVIL

Karl.

OLGA

Karl? (Quickly.) And what did he say?

DEVIL

His answer was curious. I had better not tell you       I am
afraid it would hurt you.

OLGA

No, it won't. Please tell me.



[Turns and looks at KARL.

DEVIL, following her glance

Well, perhaps later. Your little plan bids fair to succeed.

OLGA, looking away quickly

I had forgotten their existence.



[Changing quickly the conversation.

[DEVIL pats OLGA'S hands.

You have fascinating eyes



[During the following few words between ELSA
and KARL, the DEVIL whispers into the ear
of OLGA, stroking her hand gently in order to
arouse KARL'S jealousy.

KARL

I never saw you look so charming.

ELSA

I feel as if I had changed, perhaps you have something to
do with it.

DEVIL

You seem like a different woman this evening       there is
something about you       

OLGA

It is because I am with somebody I don't quite
understand       but who seems to me a man in every sense of the
word.



[This last a little louder, for KARL'S
benefit.

DEVIL

Your confession is charming. But I should be more ready to
believe it, if you hadn't made it.



[DEVIL kisses OLGA'S hand.

KARL

Our first love is generally our last, but our last love
always our first       don't you think so?

ELSA

I don't know. I've never been really in love before       but
have twice been disillusionized.

DEVIL

Love at first sight       



[The following eight sentences are spoken very
rapidly, almost at the same time.

OLGA, distraite

You are right       for the first sight       that is to say       

KARL



[Now always looking at OLGA       OLGA always
looking at KARL; the DEVIL looking pleased,
ELSA looking furious.

Disillusions       well       yes, disillusions are       disillusions.

DEVIL

I should hate to have to give an account of myself.

OLGA

Yes, indeed       but, of course       it's all a matter of taste.

ELSA

The way girls are brought up nowadays       

KARL

Exactly! Our bringing up       that is       I mean to say       of
course       of course.

OLGA

We mustn't forget       

KARL

I quite agree with you       if       if you know what I mean.

ELSA, getting up quickly and slapping her hand on the
table

No, I don't know what you mean.



[Crosses to stairs.

Take me to the ball-room       I'm engaged for the next dance.

KARL, also rising

Well,       

ELSA, almost crying, insisting

Let us go       I wish to go       



[She goes towards the stairs; KARL follows
her, goes up side stairs, meeting her at the top
as she passes OLGA.

OLGA

Oh! you are not in the ball-room.

ELSA, saucily

Can't you see?

OLGA

You'd better hurry, dear.

ELSA

I hate dancing, but I shan't miss one single dance tonight,
just to spite some people. I shall dance to the last step.



[ELSA looks at OLGA in a very impertinent
way. OLGA steps forward as if to give a reply,
when KARL comes between them; offers his arm
to ELSA.

[Exit ELSA and KARL up the staircase.

OLGA, angry

Did you hear that?

DEVIL

I did.

OLGA, rises, goes C.

What language! How dare she       she must think he loves her!

DEVIL, rises, goes to her C.

Wait! I'll tell you now what Karl said to me this afternoon.

OLGA

When you wanted to bet?

DEVIL

When I bet you would fall in love with me.



[After a short silence.

He wanted to shoot me.

OLGA, trying to hide her joy

Karl!

DEVIL

Karl, with his own hands       with this pistol       



[Takes revolver out of his pocket.

I took it away from him.

OLGA

Karl wanted to kill you       why, Doctor Miller       

DEVIL, patting revolver

Yes, with this simple prescription       six pills.



[Puts revolver back in pocket.

OLGA

This afternoon, when you only spoke about me       he wanted to
kill you       and now when he saw us here       saw you whisper in
my ear       saw you take my hand       



[Goes L. to where KARL and ELSA had sat.

he must be in love with her.

DEVIL, crossing to L. C.

Don't you think a man's a fool to try to shoot his friend
on account of a woman?

OLGA

Oh! Karl's not a fool       he thinks the world of me. And you
must have said things       but there is no doubt       that he and
Elsa       like       perhaps love each other.

DEVIL, very cold, leaning over chair at table L.

Strange! Your being so annoyed at the apparent success of
your pet scheme.

OLGA

You think it will succeed?

DEVIL

I don't know. But it's easy enough to find out.

OLGA

How?

DEVIL

This afternoon, when I told him I'd make you fall in love
with me, he wanted to shoot       that's love       don't talk to me
about respect        and thinking the world of you       they may
fire cannons out of respect, but pistols       no       that's love
every time.



[OLGA protesting silently as if the matter was
not quite important enough.

Of course, I know       this only interests you because it was
you who planned the marriage, and after all you take a
pride in the success of your scheme. Am I right?

OLGA, C. near him

Yes, yes.

DEVIL, behind pillar C.

Karl shall tell us himself which was the real thing
       the attempted murder of this afternoon, or this
little       flirtation with Elsa.

OLGA

You don't mean to ask him       

[DEVIL shakes his head slowly, smiling.

you don't mean to listen?

DEVIL

Certainly not.

OLGA

What then?

DEVIL

Very simple. But you must take my advice
unconditionally       ask for no reasons       do exactly what I tell
you.

OLGA, after careful reflection, slowly

Y-e-s.

DEVIL

I think I remember having seen you once at the Opera in a
very beautiful cloak       fur       was it not?       and cloth       

OLGA

Yes.

DEVIL

With a long train? You must put that cloak on       close it as
high as you can       and wrap yourself in it as if you were
feeling cold. Only show the tips of your shoes       then come
back here       



[She starts towards him. OLGA looks at the
DEVIL, as if she wanted to ask the reason.

no questions.

OLGA, L. of pillar C.

It's all very, very mysterious, but when you look at me
that way, I       I       can't refuse ... your eyes seem to have all
the world's wisdom behind them.

DEVIL, R. of pillar C.

You have a poor opinion of me.

OLGA, turns from him

Shall I go at once?

DEVIL

At once. And if anyone remarks on it, say you felt cold in
the conservatory.

OLGA, doubtfully

But suppose he says....

DEVIL, interrupting

Quick! He's coming.



[KARL is coming down the stairs towards the
footlights.

[OLGA has gone to the side stairs so that KARL
cannot see her. She rushes off when he is down
the stairs.

KARL



[Who has not seen her       hears the rustling of the
silk and runs to the side stairs and looks off R.

Who was that?

DEVIL

Who?

KARL, coming down to C.

Somebody just ran out       does she want to avoid me?

DEVIL, goes R., lights cigarette

Nobody ran away from me. A very pretty girl, Miss Elsa!

KARL, goes to window L.

Yes.



[Silence.

DEVIL

What's the matter?

KARL

Oh, nothing       I am not in particularly good humor       but why
should I be?

DEVIL, lights a cigarette; offers one to KARL

Will you have one?

KARL, roughly

No, thank you.



[Uncomfortable silence.

DEVIL

You seem annoyed       

KARL, comes back C., as if in a mood to quarrel

Do you want to know why?

DEVIL

No.

KARL, nervous

Well, I'll tell you       

DEVIL



[As if he wanted to go away and evade the
conversation.

Better keep it to yourself.

KARL

But I will tell you. I'm astonished at the change that has
come over you since this afternoon. I admit it upsets me,
but don't imagine it is on Olga's account       if you don't
mind, we'll leave her out of the discussion.

DEVIL

By all means.

KARL

I've made up my mind to propose to Elsa.

DEVIL, holds out his hand in an approving tone, takes
KARL'S hand and shakes it

I am very, very glad.

KARL

You are glad?

DEVIL

I am indeed.



[KARL stares at him.

What's the matter with you?

KARL, approaching the DEVIL threateningly

Look here, that was Olga who ran away just now.

DEVIL

Don't be absurd.



[Looking at floor as if his secret was
discovered.

Why should she run away from me       

KARL

You behave like a school boy.

DEVIL

What do you mean?

KARL

I mean, my dear Doctor       that you are not a gentleman.

DEVIL

I don't quite follow you.

KARL

When a gentleman would be discreet       he even conceals his
discretion.

DEVIL

Very thoughtless of me       but since you have found me out       By
the way, what you said about your marriage       is it settled?

KARL, C.

It is.

DEVIL

You will not change your mind?

KARL

I shall not.



[Crosses to settee L. and sits.

DEVIL, sits in chair L.

Very good. Now I can tell you in confidence about       look
here, you are quite sure you won't change your mind?

KARL

No fear. What is it you want to tell me       tell me
everything. I'd like to learn some of the tricks of the
trade. I may need them       

DEVIL

Tricks of the trade? This from a man about to marry? I'm
shocked.

KARL, ironically

You look it. What did you want to tell me about her?

DEVIL

About her?

KARL

About Olga.

DEVIL, looks to the ground as if he were ashamed

Oh, nothing.

KARL

Look here, I don't mind telling you her husband is?

DEVIL

Deaf, blind, dumb.



[Indicating ears, eyes, mouth and forehead.

KARL, concealing his pain very badly

And to think       and this afternoon       at my house       was the
first time       

DEVIL, goes back of settee

She's a wonder! believe me, Karl, she's a wonder. It's just
possible she's good       a dash of goodness won't hurt a pretty
woman       but I hope not. I should then have to attribute my
conquest to hypnotism       and that doesn't flatter my vanity.
What do you think? We had agreed       just now when she ran
away       ah       



[Checks himself

So it was Olga!

DEVIL

Well, yes, it was       I hardly know how to tell you       It was a
mad impulse. I proposed, just for fun, without the least
idea she would take it up; it means risking her reputation
and social position       everything       not to mention the risk of
catching cold       

DEVIL

KARL, startled

What do you mean?

DEVIL

Well, this evening       before all her guests       there are a
hundred and thirty I believe       

KARL, impatient

Yes, go on.

DEVIL

       before the élite of Vienna I may say       she will walk
through the ball-room on my arm       in (suggestive
pause)       an opera cloak.

KARL, not quite grasping it

An opera cloak?

DEVIL, suggestively

That's all.

KARL

You mean to tell me       she       

DEVIL

She will be here in a moment       and then       before all
Vienna       amid the bacchanalian ecstasy       of music, perfume,
dancing       I will escort her through the ball-room like a
classic goddess       like a modern Mona Vanna       in an opera
cloak       

KARL

You liar!

DEVIL, apparently frightened

But, Karl       

KARL

It's a lie. It's a damnable lie.

DEVIL

You tried to catch me       and I have caught you. You love this
woman.

KARL, L. C., very loudly

Yes, I love her. I have listened to all your lies       I have
seen you as I've seen a hundred like you       steal a good
woman's reputation and call it success, social success       and
boast about it as you drag her in the mud. You have
trapped me, it's true       but you will suffer for it. It
is my turn now       and I'll put you out of this house, you
blackguard       get out before I kick you out.

DEVIL, C. backs up onto second step; stands

Wait! She is coming now.



[Points to door down R.

KARL

Get out, I said.



[The DEVIL goes back slowly up the stairs.
KARL is about to follow him up as DEVIL is
on third step, OLGA comes on in her opera
cloak and comes down stairs to R. The DEVIL
goes behind her. KARL backs over L. Long
silence, KARL stares at OLGA and the DEVIL,
speechless.

OLGA

Karl, you have not spoken to me once tonight.

DEVIL, stands very near to OLGA, cynically

The opera cloak       

OLGA

Everybody is gay, the girls dance as if it were their first
ball       the young men as if it were their last.

DEVIL

Strange! that amidst all this gaiety Karl should be so sad.

OLGA

Sad?

KARL, with forced gaiety

Oh, no       never felt happier in my life.

OLGA

I am glad to hear it.

KARL

I feel like       like a boy       of twenty       like a fool.

DEVIL, coming down to C.

No! No!

KARL

I am going to take your advice from this on       I'm going to
get drunk tonight.

OLGA, shocked

You, Karl? You drunk?

KARL, L.

Yes. I am doing things today that I never did before. I've
never been engaged before.

OLGA, R.

And tonight?

KARL

Tonight I shall become engaged.

DEVIL

I have already offered him my congratulations       she's a
charming girl.

KARL

A splendid girl. Much too good for me       but marrying is
something new to me       I want to try it. It is a sensation I
have never had.

DEVIL

You don't seem very gay for a bridegroom.

KARL

That's only the last drop of single bitterness       the dregs
of bachelorhood       I'll soon get rid of that and then       

OLGA

Bravo, bravo!

KARL

Oh spare yourself. I'm only thinking of my own pleasure.

OLGA

Karl, I am afraid you have been drinking already.

KARL

You are at liberty to think what you please.

DEVIL

He is in a bad humor to-day. I told you.

KARL, cannot keep himself any longer

You will catch cold. Why don't you take off your cloak?



[Goes C.

DEVIL, very quiet

Perhaps Madame is feeling cold.

OLGA, wrapping herself tighter in her cloak

Yes, I feel cold.

DEVIL

Any one not knowing you might think you wear this cloak
just to show it off.

OLGA

Don't let us speak about the cloak.



[To KARL in a different tone; crosses to KARL
L. C.

You seemed to get on very well with Elsa?

KARL

Did I?

DEVIL

It was really charming to watch them.

OLGA

I feel very cold.

DEVIL

I thought you would.

KARL

Cold. I find it hot in here.

OLGA, crosses back R.

I feel cold.

DEVIL

Perhaps your dress is thin. The way lovely woman flirts
with pneumonia       she wears her lung upon her sleeve.

OLGA

Everything sweet in life comes through carelessness.

KARL, L. C., very excited

And do you find boldness sweet?

OLGA

What's that to you? Were you ever bold?

KARL, crosses to C., losing his self-control completely

Aren't you afraid of me       you two?



[OLGA shivers.

DEVIL, R. C., coldly

I? Not even of the legitimate husband       much less a
moralising bridegroom.



[HERMAN enters quickly from above stairs, comes
down L., stands next to KARL.

HERMAN, banteringly

Ah, Olga! I see you are well taken care of.

DEVIL, bowing

It is a privilege.

HERMAN, taking KARL aside

Well, how are you and Elsa getting along?



[Goes with KARL towards the back of the stage.

OLGA, quickly to the DEVIL

What have you said to him about my cloak?

DEVIL

About your cloak? Why should I speak of your cloak?

OLGA

You must have said something about my cloak       I felt it he
moment I came in.

DEVIL

What do you mean?

OLGA

The way he seemed to look through me. It was almost as if
he imagined       what did you say? What did you insinuate?

DEVIL

Just what you are thinking.

OLGA, her hands dropping, her head falling backwards with
closed eyes, shivering

Oh! How could you?

DEVIL, cynically

Come now, don't pretend to be shocked. You admitted you
felt it the moment you came in. The thought seemed to
please you.

OLGA

How dare you speak to me like that! Oh! if I had known.

DEVIL

Then why didn't you take off your cloak? When you saw       you
didn't even open it. Why don't you open it now? The idea
seems to please you still.

KARL, re-enters, angrily.

Olga!

OLGA



[A little scream.

Your arm, Doctor.



[DEVIL gives her his arm. As they are about to
go upstairs, KARL comes back from R.

OLGA, looking coldly over shoulder at KARL

Are you going to stay here?

KARL

Yes; and you, too!

OLGA

What do you mean?

KARL

You stay here.

DEVIL

What's that?



[OLGA tries to go away with the devil into the
ball-room, but KARL steps into their way on the
stairs.

KARL

Olga, you shall not go into the ball-room!



[DEVIL, as if about to leave them alone, is held
off by KARL, who steps in front of him now.

You shall not leave       it concerns you, too.

OLGA

Doctor, give me your arm. Doctor!

KARL, in tone of command

Stop! We'll settle this thing now       right here!

OLGA

Are you mad?

DEVIL, goes up stairs below KARL

If I didn't think he was mad       

KARL

Take off that cloak.

OLGA, at L. foot of stairs firmly;

No

KARL

Take, off that cloak.

OLGA, to DEVIL

Please, Doctor, protect me.

KARL, half maddened

Then I'll make you!



[KARL rushes down stairs, DEVIL catches him
before he reaches the bottom and holds him back.

OLGA, standing very erect, to DEVIL

Why did you stop him       ?



[DEVIL lets KARL go.

DEVIL, at foot of stairs, in a very low voice as if
ashamed

Really, Madame, for all I know       



[Feigns embarrassment.

OLGA, to DEVIL

Will you please help me off with my cloak?

DEVIL, starts to help, then crosses to L. of her, with
gesture of refusal.

Madame! Ah!

KARL, comes down to her, C.

I will.

OLGA, very loud

No.



[Wraps herself closer in the cloak.

[DEVIL and KARL stare at each other. The
DEVIL shrugs his shoulders, OLGA goes up the
stairs.

HERMAN, coming through the door Oh! There you are. My
dear! His Excellency is looking for you. He is about to
leave.

OLGA, as if very tired All right. Please help me off with
my cloak.

HERMAN

All right, darling.



[Takes off her cloak and puts it over his arm.
[OLGA stands in the same gown as she had on at
the beginning of the act, with her back to the
audience.

OLGA, looking at KARL and DEVIL, and speaking with
ironical courtliness, taking HERMAN'S arm.

Gentlemen.



[Exit HERMAN with OLGA.

[KARL has been standing on one side of the stage
as if dreaming, suddenly runs to the other side
of the stage as if to choke the devil who stands
there.

KARL, crossing to DEVIL, L. C.

What have you done?



[DEVIL thrusts revolver into KARL'S hand.

DEVIL

Look out! It's loaded!



[KARL stands absolutely still, holding
revolver. [To KARL, insolently:

If I hadn't given you that pistol you might have slapped my
face. Believe me, there's nothing like turning the other
cheek       if you turn it quickly enough       your enemy will miss
both cheeks.



[KARL turns away angrily, lays revolver on table
R.

[DEVIL goes down and takes revolver from table
R.

[KARL stands absent-minded, when ELSA enters
with her cloak ready to leave.

ELSA

Karl, I wanted to say good-bye to you.

KARL, as if the tone of her voice was awakening him

Oh! my dear, dear Elsa!



[About to go towards her to kiss her.

[The DEVIL comes back and steps between them.

[MAN SERVANT enters from behind stairs and
speaks to ELSA.

MAN SERVANT

Your mother is waiting for you in the hall, Fräulein,

KARL

May I see you to your carriage?



[Offers ELSA his arm and they go off.

DEVIL, to MAN SERVANT

Will you accompany Miss Elsa to her carriage? It is
slippery outside, she might fall.



[Exit MAN SERVANT, following KARL and ELSA.

OLGA, enters from R., agitated; sits at table L.

Your scheme was a great success.

DEVIL

What are you going to do?

OLGA, writes on an envelope

I'm going to write to him.

DEVIL, crosses to her, reads the envelope

To Karl       but what will you write?

OLGA

He wanted to settle my account. I will settle his. I will
never see him again. Oh! To have thought me capable       of....
How could he? I despise him!

DEVIL

Pour quoi, Madame?

OLGA

Because       because       

DEVIL

Because you love him?

OLGA, frightened

What!



[Tries to get her thoughts together.

After what has happened, I hate him. And I shall tell him
so.

DEVIL

I am very sorry.



[Takes pen from her.

OLGA

Don't be sorry. I have much to thank you for. You have
rendered me a service. I shall feel better when I have sent
this letter off.

DEVIL

You'd better make it plain.

OLGA

I shall speak my mind       there shall be no mistake.

DEVIL

That's it; express your real feelings.



[With ironical emphasis.

Cold. Harsh.

OLGA

Cold? Harsh?

DEVIL

Make an end of it       once for all.



[Dipping pen.

OLGA, taking pen

Once for all.

DEVIL

Now write.



[OLGA speaks the first sentence as she writes
it. At the word "longer" the devil takes it
up, finishing the sentence with a different
meaning, and dictates rest of letter walking up
and down.




Dr. Miller (The Devil)



OLGA, in hard voice, speaks while writing

Sir, your behavior of this evening has shown me that you
are no longer       

DEVIL, continuing

       able to keep up the wretched farce of mere friendship. I
read your inmost thought tonight and       Karl       the knowledge
that you love me has made me unspeakably happy. Dearest       



[OLGA looks up at the DEVIL, who is standing
now at her L. He repeats "Dearest" and points to
letter. She resumes writing.

       why should we struggle any longer against the resistless
tide that is drawing us together? My strength is gone.



[OLGA looks up again. The DEVIL repeats "My
strength is gone" by motion of lips, making no
sound. She writes:

       without you I am lost in the black waters       save me, Karl.
With your strong arms about me       with your lips to mine       I
care not where we drift. I am yours, all yours. You are the
master of my soul. Do not leave me, Karl; I love you, I
cannot live without you. God bless you!



[OLGA'S head falls forward on her arm

OLGA, as if awakening

What have I written?

DEVIL, folding letter

What was in your heart!

OLGA, laughs hysterically

I have written everything I had meant never to say.

DEVIL, taking up letter

If women wrote time tables, they would tell all the hours
that the trains didn't start and all the places you mustn't
stop at to get to your destination.



[DEVIL puts the letter into envelope.

OLGA, horrified

What are you doing?

DEVIL, coldly

I will deliver the letter. Women sometimes do not write
what they want, but they always want what they write.

OLGA

He must not. He shall not see it.



[HERMAN comes down stairs

HERMAN

Good! You're the kind of guest I like       when all the rest
have deserted the ship you stay and keep the hostess
company.

DEVIL, crosses to C., putting letter into his pocket

Madame has been so entertaining, that I       

HERMAN, crossing to bell R.

Well, let's have another cognac before you go       quite en
famille.

DEVIL

Thank you very much, but I have an important call very
early in the morning. Madame,       



[Goes to OLGA, kisses her hand.

[To HERMAN:

I have spent a very pleasant evening at your house.

HERMAN, coming to him C., they shake hands

The pleasure is mine.



[DEVIL starts to go. OLGA utters a suppressed cry.

DEVIL

Madame?

OLGA, frightened to death, with a forced smile trying to
appear undisturbed

There was a piece of paper here. Did you perhaps take it by
mistake?



[She is almost crying from fright.

DEVIL, coming down stairs, taking the letter out of his
pocket



[Going towards HERMAN as if he was going to
give him the letter.

Do you mean this?

OLGA, deathly pale

No, no It was not that.



[Laughing bitterly.

DEVIL, bowing

Madame.



[Bows to HERMAN. Goes off upstairs. Bows low
to both and goes out.

HERMAN crosses to OLGA

Well, I'm glad it's over. You look tired, dearie.

OLGA, standing by table L.

I am tired.

HERMAN

You look flushed. But it's very becoming, you never looked
prettier.



[OLGA is leaning backwards over the table, he
takes her hand.

My darling wife.



[Goes to kiss her.

OLGA, unkind

Please, please don't.

HERMAN, crosses to C. Looks at his watch

It is after four o'clock, Olga.



[Tries to kiss her again.

OLGA

Please, please don't. I feel so nervous.

HERMAN

Your cheeks are burning.



[Pats her cheeks.

OLGA, nervous, impatient

Please       

HERMAN

All right, all right, I'm going.



[He goes towards the door on the R.

Are you going to stay here?

OLGA, at table L.

Let me rest a minute.

HERMAN

As you please.



[MAN SERVANT comes in above platform, and goes
up side stairs.

OLGA, to servant

What do you want?

MAN SERVANT

The lights, Madame.

OLGA

Turn off the lights.



[The MAN SERVANT puts all the lights out. The
lamps in the street and the garden are lighted,
but the room is dark.

HERMAN

It would be wiser to sleep, my dear.



[He waits a minute, shrugs his shoulders, then
goes out R.

OLGA, stands leaning on the table

To go to sleep....



[The DEVIL can be seen outside in his fur
overcoat, crossing through the garden. As he
passes a lamp in the garden his shadow reaching
up to the ceiling is thrown on the white wall of
the room, OLGA is crossing to R. He takes his
hat off, at which moment she sees the shadow on
the wall, OLGA shrieks.

No!



[She drops into a chair.

CURTAIN




ACT III


SCENE.       Like Act I. The afternoon of the next day, about
three o'clock. When the curtain rises, the DEVIL is
seated in a big chair. Bell rings off stage R. HEINRICH
enters R.

DEVIL, rising from chair

What do you want?

HEINRICH

There is a lady, sir.

DEVIL

What kind of a lady?

HEINRICH

A real lady, sir.

DEVIL

What does she want?

HEINRICH

She wants to see my master. I told her he was not up yet,
but she said she would wait.

DEVIL

Do you know who the lady is? Have you seen her before?

HEINRICH

Never.

DEVIL

Ask her to step in here.



[HEINRICH goes off, shows ELSA in.

[DEVIL bows.

Ah!

ELSA

You seem to be everywhere. What are you doing here? Are you
his secretary?

DEVIL

No, merely a good friend. Nothing else. I just happened in.
By the way, how do you do?

ELSA

How do you do?



[Crosses to couch, sits.

I didn't know there was anybody in this room or I would not
have come in. But as it is only you I don't mind.



[ELSA sits down, intentionally turning her back
to the DEVIL.

DEVIL

Karl is expecting you, then?

ELSA

Oh, no.

DEVIL

Will you permit me to prepare him for this pleasant
surprise?

ELSA

No, thank you. Don't disturb him. I can look around while
I'm waiting. I have never been here before.

DEVIL

I know it.

ELSA

Who told you?

DEVIL

The man       a lady might come every day and escape notice       but
coming for the first time she would be sure to attract his
attention.

ELSA

I feel embarrassed coming here alone.

DEVIL

I know that, too.

ELSA

From the same source?

DEVIL

Yes; he said you were a real lady.

ELSA

He is the only one here who has spoken to me like a
gentleman.

DEVIL

He must have thought you were a model.

ELSA, rises; angrily

How dare you?

DEVIL

A servant can only speak like a gentleman to       his equals.

ELSA, sits down again; sarcastically

Then I was mistaken       it is not Heinrich who is the servant.

DEVIL

Who knows       perhaps he is a clergyman.

ELSA

I don't understand you.

DEVIL

Only two people in the world may open the door of a
bachelor's apartment to a young lady       the man servant, or a
clergyman with a marriage certificate        you can take your
choice.

ELSA

Let me tell you I was once left alone with a gentleman who
tried to kiss me, and I slapped his face.

DEVIL

Indeed? I was once left alone with a lady who tried to slap
me and I kissed her face.



[Enter HEINRICH.

ELSA, controlling herself with difficulty

Oh!

DEVIL

Heinrich! There's a little leather satchel in the pocket of
my overcoat.



[HEINRICH goes out.

ELSA

Don't be afraid. This is not my day for crying.

DEVIL

It's when a girl laughs that I'm most afraid.



[HEINRICH brings the satchel, puts it on the
table L. C. and goes into studio.

Why did you come here?

ELSA

I intend to sit for my portrait       to do that, I must come
every day.

DEVIL

You intend to come here every day, and to do that you must
have your portrait painted.

ELSA

You are clever at twisting words.

DEVIL

Perhaps you know there is another lady coming every day to
have her portrait painted?

ELSA

Yes, I know. That's why I want mine painted       we'll see
which will be the better likeness.

DEVIL

Come now       you must let me sit down       this time I want you to
be right.



[Raises her and swings her in front of him.

[DEVIL sits on couch, ELSA leans on table.

Are you aware       

ELSA

This is awful       you question me like a judge.

DEVIL

It is you who answer like a prisoner. Do you know that Karl
is in love with Olga?

ELSA, bitterly

Do I know it!

DEVIL

And you still mean to fight?

ELSA

Yes, I mean to fight       you gave me good advice.

DEVIL

That was yesterday.

ELSA

Well       this is to-day.

DEVIL, impressively

Yesterday was your winning day. Yesterday it was written
that you, Elsa, would succeed in whatever thing you made up
your mind to do, with the whole strength of your will.

ELSA

Last night I made up my mind to       

DEVIL, interrupting gravely

       to dance every dance       



[Pause

You danced every dance.

ELSA, defiantly

Karl asked me to marry him last night.

DEVIL

       and you refused.

ELSA

Yes       but to-day I shall       

DEVIL

To-day is not your winning day       yesterday you chose       to-day
you will have no choice.

ELSA

I won't give him up       I can't       I don't know how.

DEVIL

You will have to learn       let me see       I think I know some one
who has learned the lesson and can teach it to you       



[Goes to hall door which he opens.

Why, Mimi! Why do you wait out there? Come in here where
it's warm!



[MIMI comes in       DEVIL seats MIMI C. He
regards them both with a satanic smile       begins to
hum a tune and exits L., singing as he gets out;
he laughs       his laugh dies away outside.

MIMI, sitting on small chair C. After a silence

Are you waiting for the painter, too, Madame?

ELSA, seated on couch

Yes.

MIMI

Yes       



[Pause.

He must have been on a spree last night.

[Smiling.

When he goes on a spree he always sleeps late.

ELSA, somewhat embarrassed

Yes?

MIMI, making conversation

Yes. If you haven't slept for a long time, then       you must
sleep a long time.

ELSA

Yes?

MIMI

Yes. Madame       



[Silence.

Is Madame going to have her portrait painted?

ELSA

Yes.

MIMI

Yes, Madame       I know all the ladies that come here       



[Quick look from ELSA.

I'm quite at home here       I'm his model



[Explaining.

I don't pay for my portraits.



[Regarding ELSA.

You have a splendid profile, Madame.

ELSA

You always say "Madame"       I am not married. My name is       

MIMI, interrupting

I know your name. I've heard it often. You belong to a very
rich family. I know what that means, I used to be well off,
too. I wasn't always obliged to work for a living.

ELSA

No?

MIMI

I was a chorus girl, but I had bad luck.

ELSA

I am so sorry for you.

MIMI



[Silence.

I know all about you and Herr Karl.



[Rises, goes C.

ELSA

From whom?

MIMI

I know everything that goes on in this house. I told you I
was his model       I sew on buttons and count the laundry.



[Importantly.

ELSA

Does the laundry-woman steal?

MIMI

No. But she uses strong blueing       I know everything Herr
Karl thinks of.



[Pointing at ELSA.

ELSA, as if she was getting interested

And does that interest you?

MIMI

Yes, indeed it does. But that's all over now

ELSA

Why so?

MIMI

Because he is going to get married

ELSA

But he will paint just the same       he will want models.

MIMI

Yes, but       



[Ingeniously.

you know, when one has sewn on buttons       and counted the
laundry       then to be       just a plain model       that hurts.



[Goes up C.; ELSA crosses.

ELSA

And you like Herr Karl?

MIMI, repressing her feelings

Yes       I       I like him       he's such a dear boy.

ELSA

Does he paint you now?

MIMI, coming to head of couch; sadly

No. He only paints landscapes and       bank presidents.

ELSA

Then you did not come to pose to-day?

MIMI

A model always comes to pose. It's tiring work, too, I can
tell you       and if the artist wants to make love        it isn't
her fault       and       



[Sighs.

Oh, it's such a rest.

ELSA

Oh, please.



[Draws herself up stiffly, offended.

MIMI

Now I've offended you       I ought to have known better       my
people are all refined       I wasn't born a model.

ELSA

I'm sorry I showed it       but       I       I'm nervous to-day.

MIMI, brightening

Oh, I know what it is       I used to suffer dreadfully from
nervousness when I was in the chorus.

ELSA

Come over here, Mimi; I want to talk to you.

MIMI, goes over and sits on the couch

You can talk to me about everything, I'm not a bad sort,
really I'm not. I've known all along about Herr Karl
and       and you       he's such a kind man. I was crying when
I went away yesterday, and he felt sorry for me and he
came to see me on his way to the ball       in his evening
clothes       but I didn't receive him. If it's over, it may as
well be over.

ELSA

Was he fond of you?

MIMI

I loved him, but what's the use? It's like the railway
       the station is there and the train comes and then the
train goes away, and the station cannot run after it; if
the station is small, the train only stops a minute, and       



[Sighs.

one must wait until another train comes

ELSA

You loved him and can speak like that?

MIMI

Yes, I loved him, but it's all over now. I was foolish to
come here again when I'd made up my mind I wouldn't, but
now I'm sensible again; I'll go away and try to forget him,
I hope he will be       hap-hap       happy!



[Begins to cry, looks for handkerchief in muff,
but can't find it. ELSA takes handkerchief out
of "weeping satchel," and gives it to her.

ELSA

Poor Mimi! Poor Mimi!

MIMI, wiping her eyes with handkerchief, then returning it
to ELSA.

I       hope       you will be       hap       happy       too!

ELSA

I       happy?

MIMI

You are going to marry Karl       

ELSA

No       no       I'm not.

MIMI

But it's you he's in love with       

ELSA

No, Mimi; I'm not the one       it's some one else.

MIMI

You don't mean Mrs. Zanden       it can't be       why, she's your
friend.

ELSA

She was.

MIMI

I don't believe it       it's not love       it's a madness       a       

ELSA, jumping at the idea

An infatuation?

MIMI

Yes, that's it       he's not in love with her       he's not himself.

ELSA

You think so?

MIMI

Yesterday he acted as if he were under some strange       



[Rises.

[MIMI looks nervously behind her on both sides,
ELSA follows her example.

under some strange       

ELSA

Influence?

MIMI

Yes.



[The two girls look at each other in
silence       -for what seems like a minute.

ELSA

Mimi, who is that man?

MIMI, looks behind her again nervously

I don't know       I hate him.

ELSA, after looking behind her

So do I.



[They grasp each other's hands across the table.

[A pause.

MIMI, holding ELSA'S hand

I'm glad I came, I feel better already for having seen you.
I'm going to be sensible now. I'm going away       and I'm never
coming back!



[In altered voice.

What time is it?

ELSA

It's almost three o'clock.

MIMI

Three o'clock! Then I must hurry. I have an appointment at
half past       he's an illustrator       such a talented boy; he's
just had a picture accepted by the Fleigende Blatter.

ELSA

And you are posing for him?

MIMI

Oh, yes; but tonight he goes to the artists' dinner, and I
have to find his dress studs, and iron a tie for him, and
trim his cuffs.



[Makes gesture of cutting with scissors outside
the edge of her cuff.

Good-bye.



[Goes out quickly.

ELSA



[Looks after MIMI, then around the room,
suddenly begins to sob, and calls in frightened
voice:

Mimi! Mimi!



[Runs off.

[DEVIL enters just as ELSA leaves.

[DEVIL rings bell on table.

HEINRICH, entering

Did you ring, sir?

DEVIL

Where is my tea? Have you any rum in the house?

HEINRICH

Yes, sir.

DEVIL

I'll have some with my tea. Is your master getting up?

HEINRICH

Yes, sir.

DEVIL

Has anyone called to see him this morning?

HEINRICH

Mrs. Zanden's maid has been here three times.

DEVIL

What did she want?

HEINRICH

She inquired whether Mrs. Zanden could see my master. I
told her I had strict orders not to call him before three.

DEVIL

Hurry with the tea.



[Door bell rings.

I'll have it in here.



[DEVIL goes into studio.

[HEINRICH goes out to hall, door slams, OLGA
speaking outside.

OLGA

Is your master at home?

HEINRICH

Yes, Madame.

OLGA, entering

My maid told me I could not see him until three       it is
three o'clock now.

HEINRICH

I am very sorry, Madame, but you will have to wait a few
minutes longer. I will tell him that you are here.

OLGA

Thank you.



[HEINRICH crosses to studio door.

Wait! Has anyone called to see your master this morning?

HEINRICH

No, Madame.

OLGA

Didn't anyone leave a letter for him?

HEINRICH

No, Madame.

OLGA, aside

Thank God! Please tell him I'm here.

HEINRICH

I'm afraid, Madame, you will have to wait a moment; but I
will tell the doctor              

OLGA, quickly

What doctor?

HEINRICH

The gentleman who was here with you yesterday.

OLGA, aside

Dr. Miller? He       is       in       there?

HEINRICH

Yes, Madame.

OLGA, aside

Then I'm too late.



[To HEINRICH, reluctantly

Did you see Dr. Miller give a letter to your master? A
piece of paper?

HEINRICH

Possibly, Madame, but I don't remember.

OLGA

Tell Dr. Miller to come at once. Say a lady wishes to speak
to him, but don't give him my name.



[HEINRICH goes out.

[OLGA walks up and down terribly agitated.

[DEVIL enters.

DEVIL

Are you the lady who wishes to see me at once?

OLGA

Oh, tell me       did you       have you...?

DEVIL, nods

Yes       delivered.



[OLGA sinks into chair, clasping her hands
tightly.

[Enter HEINRICH, busy with tea things.

Put it here. Thank you.

OLGA



[Without looking at the DEVIL.

Did he read it?

DEVIL

Yes.

[Is busy with his tea.



[Silence.

OLGA

My God!

DEVIL



[Now standing behind OLGA, tea cup in his hand.

After he read it, he buried his face in the pillow and
cried.

OLGA

He cried?

DEVIL

I hate men who cry.

OLGA

I did not want him to have that letter. I wanted to speak
to him first. I wanted to ask him to give me my letter back
unopened I am too late.

DEVIL

You were not too late. It's I that was too early.

OLGA

He cried?

DEVIL

From joy.

OLGA

I haven't the courage to speak to him, and yet I feel that
I must. I would like to go away, but something holds me;
something I cannot       I cannot       oh, what will become of me?

HEINRICH, at door

My master will be here in a moment, sir.



[HEINRICH goes out.

DEVIL

I must be going.

OLGA

Don't go! Please stay. I don't want to be alone with him.

DEVIL

But if I am here you cannot speak to him about the letter.
I shall only be in the way.

OLGA, very weak

Very well, then, I shall speak to him quite frankly. I
shall ask him for the last time       

KARL, voice from the studio

Heinrich!

DEVIL, quick

There he is.

OLGA, very weak

Please stay.

DEVIL, pointing to the small door at L.

I shall be here. If you need me, call.



[DEVIL goes out.

[KARL comes in from the studio.

KARL, kisses OLGA'S hand passionately

Olga! I ought to go on my knees and beg your pardon for
what I did last night.

OLGA

Speak low       Dr. Miller is in there.

KARL

Olga       can you ever              

OLGA

No, no; it is I who should ask forgiveness I was to blame.
I lost control of myself. After what happened, I wanted to
know       I wanted to make sure       but, you understand now, my
letter has told you everything.

KARL

What letter?

OLGA, reproachfully

Karl, I understand. You want to spare me       you're being
discreet; but you don't know me; I mean every word of that
letter, I'm glad I wrote it              

KARL

But I didn't get any letter.

OLGA

Didn't Doctor Miller give you a letter?

KARL

No, no; really. 




Olga and Karl



OLGA



[Angry and almost crying, crossing to door.

Doctor Miller.



[DEVIL enters.

My       my letter.

DEVIL

Ah, pardon me, Madame, a thousand pardons, I quite forgot.
The only excuse I can offer is that there are some letters
which ought never to be delivered.



[Takes letter out of his pocket

OLGA



[Takes a step towards KARL, looks at DEVIL
over her shoulder, shivers slightly.

Who is that man?



[Silence, KARL looks at DEVIL, OLGA is
terrified.

[DEVIL crosses, gives the letter to KARL with
a smile.

[OLGA, quickly, to KARL.

Tear that letter up.



[KARL tears up letter.

Put it in the fire.



[KARL crumples up the pieces and throws them
in the fire. As he does so, OLGA makes an
involuntary movement with her hand as if to
stop him, but he does not see it as his back is
turned. The DEVIL sees it, however, and smiles

DEVIL

I sincerely regret if my forgetfulness has caused any
inconvenience

KARL, at alcove, pointing to door R



[Offensively.

Pray don't let me detain you       

DEVIL

My train doesn't leave for an hour. Once more a thousand
pardons.



[Crossing to C., turning to both.

If I could have foreseen what terrible distress the
non-delivery of this letter              

KARL, firmly

You may be quite sure it contained nothing       er       nothing       



[At a loss for a word.

DEVIL, looking at OLGA

Nothing.

KARL, at large chair

You will miss your train.

DEVIL, to OLGA, bowing

Madame       



[To KARL, offering hand.

[KARL turns his back.

Good-bye, a thousand pardons.



[Exit DEVIL at door to hall.

OLGA

I would have given anything in the world if you had not
burned that letter.

KARL

Why       you told       me       



[OLGA shrugs her shoulders as if to say, "What
can one expect of a man?"

What does it matter anyway, whatever it is? I would rather
hear it from your lips.

OLGA, firmly

No! The letter is burned; it is nothing but ashes       it is
dead       no human power can bring it back to life.

KARL

But, Olga!

OLGA

A moment ago I would have given all I possessed to save it
from the fire       and now       

KARL

What has happened?

OLGA

I can't tell you. I only know I am glad       I'm glad.



[OLGA here seems to have suddenly become
composed, almost happy, as if something had been
settled, though not as she had wished, still it
is a relief.

KARL, takes her hand

Olga, do you mean you will never       

OLGA, smiling

I mean you will never know what was in that letter       it is
as if it had never been written       it has ceased to exist,
and we are past the day of miracles.

KARL, impatiently

Miracles?

OLGA

No, no! Only the devil himself would re-create that letter
from its burnt ashes. Good-bye, Karl. I'm going now       I
shan't see you again.



[Shakes hands naturally.

[At word "Devil" the DEVIL enters silently
from hall door. He has his fur coat on. He smiles
wickedly, and at OLGA'S words "re-create that
letter," pulls OLGA'S letter out of his pocket,
and stands so that the chair hides him from KARL
and OLGA, who are close to studio door.

KARL

Olga, you are afraid of something. What is it?

OLGA

I'm afraid of       myself       good-bye!

KARL

Good-bye, Olga.



[They turn and see the devil.

[To DEVIL, angrily.

I thought you'd gone!



[Goes abruptly into the studio, OLGA stands as
if hypnotized.

DEVIL, to OLGA

I beg your pardon, I am so upset to-day       



[Holding out letter.

I made a mistake       I gave you my tailor's bill instead of
your letter       here is your letter!



[DEVIL gives the letter to OLGA, who snatches
it from him in a frightened manner and tears it
open. She recognizes her letter.

OLGA

Karl! my letter! I have my letter       



[She runs into the studio.

[The DEVIL goes to the door of the studio,
smiles diabolically, listens a minute at the door
and rubs his hands as if he was very pleased with
himself.

DEVIL

Voilà!


CURTAIN.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
