	<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

	<p>It is unfortunately true that the terms education and
	culture are not synonymous. Too often we find that
	the children in our public schools, while possessed of
	the one, are signally lacking in the other. This is a
	state of things that cannot be remedied by teaching
	mere facts. The Greeks, many years ago, found the
	true method of imparting the latter grace and we shall
	probably not be able to discover a better one to-day.
	Their youths learned Homer and the other great poets
	as a part of their daily tasks, and by thus constantly
	dwelling upon and storing in their minds the noblest
	and most beautifully expressed thought in their literature,
	their own mental life became at once refined and
	strong.</p>

	<p>The basis of all culture lies in a pure and elevated
	moral nature, and so noted an authority as President
	Eliot, of Harvard University, has said that the short
	memory gems which he learned as a boy in school, have
	done him more good in the hour of temptation than all
	the sermons he ever heard preached. A fine thought
	or beautiful image, once stored in the mind, even if at
	first it is received indifferently and with little understanding,
	is bound to recur again and again, and its
	companionship will have a sure, if unconscious, influence.
	The mind that has been filled in youth with
	many such thoughts and images will surely bear fruit
	in fine and gracious actions.</p>

	<p>To the teachers who are persuaded of this truth, the
	present collection of poems has much to recommend it.
	<a class="pagenum disguise" id="pageiv" title="iv">&nbsp;</a>The selections have been chosen both for their
	moral influence and for their permanent value as literature.
	They have been carefully graded to suit the
	needs of every class from the primary to the high
	school. Either the whole poem or a sufficiently long
	quotation has been inserted to give the child a complete
	mental picture.</p>

	<p>The teacher will thus escape the difficulty of choosing
	among a too great abundance of riches, or the still
	greater one of finding for herself, with few resources,
	what serves her purpose. This volume has a further
	advantage over other books of selections. It is so
	moderate in price that it will be possible to place it in
	the hands of the children themselves.</p>

	<p>The compilers desire to thank Messrs. Houghton,
	Mifflin &amp; Co., Charles Scribner&#8217;s Sons, Bowen, Merrill
	&amp; Co., Whittaker &amp; Ray Co., and Doubleday &amp; McClure
	Co., for their kindness in permitting the use of copyrighted
	material.</p>

		<h3>PAUL REVERE&#8217;S RIDE.</h3>
	<div class="stanza">
	<p>Listen, my children, and you shall hear</p>
	<p>Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere.</p>
	<p>On the eighteenth of April in Seventy-five;</p>
	<p>Hardly a man is now alive</p>
	<p>Who remembers that famous day and year.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p>He said to his friend, &#8220;If the British march</p>
	<p>By land or sea from the town<a href="#footnote_21" id="fnm21" title="Boston." class="fnmarker">21</a> to-night,</p>
	<p>Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch</p>
	<p>Of the North Church tower as a signal light&#8212;</p>
	<p>One if by land, and two if by sea,</p>
	<p>And I on the opposite shore<a href="#footnote_22" id="fnm22" title="Charlestown." class="fnmarker">22</a> will be,</p>
	<p>Ready to ride and spread the alarm</p>
	<p>Through every Middlesex village and farm,</p>
	<p>For the country folk to be up and to arm.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p>Then he said &#8220;Good-night!&#8221; and with muffled oar</p>
	<p>Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore,</p>
	<p>Just as the moon rose over the bay,</p>
	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page113" title="113">&nbsp;</a>Where swinging wide at her moorings lay</p>
	<p>The Somerset, British man-of-war;</p>
	<p>A phantom ship, with each mast and spar</p>
	<p>Across the moon like a prison bar,</p>
	<p>And a huge black hulk that was magnified</p>
	<p>By its own reflection in the tide.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p>Meanwhile, his friend, through alley and street,</p>
	<p>Wanders and watches with eager ears,</p>
	<p>Till in the silence around him he hears</p>
	<p>The muster of men at the barrack door,</p>
	<p>The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,</p>
	<p>And the measured tread of the grenadiers<a href="#footnote_23" id="fnm23" title="grenadiers, British soldiers." class="fnmarker">23</a></p>
	<p>Marching down to their boats on the shore.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p>Then he climbed to the tower of the church,</p>
	<p>Up the wooden stairs with stealthy tread,</p>
	<p>To the belfry chamber overhead,</p>
	<p>And startled the pigeons from their perch,</p>
	<p>On the sombre rafters, that round him made</p>
	<p>Masses and moving shapes of shade&#8212;</p>
	<p>Up the light ladder, slender and tall,</p>
	<p>To the highest window in the wall,</p>
	<p>Where he paused to listen and look down</p>
	<p>A moment on the roofs of the town,</p>
	<p>And the moonlight flowing over all.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page114" title="114">&nbsp;</a>Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,</p>
	<p>Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride</p>
	<p>On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere</p>
	<p>Now he patted his horse&#8217;s side,</p>
	<p>Now gazed at the landscape far and near,</p>
	<p>Then, impetuous, stamped the earth,</p>
	<p>And turned and tightened his saddle girth;</p>
	<p>But mostly he watched with eager search</p>
	<p>The belfry-tower of the old North Church,</p>
	<p>As it rose above the graves on the hill,</p>
	<p>Lonely and spectral and sombre and still.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p>And lo! as he looks, on the belfry&#8217;s height</p>
	<p>A glimmer, and then a gleam of light!</p>
	<p>He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,</p>
	<p>But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight</p>
	<p>A <em>second</em> lamp in the belfry burns!</p>

	<p>Struck out by a steed that flies fearless and fleet;</p>
	<p>That was all! And yet through the gloom and the light,</p>
	<p>The fate of a nation was riding that night.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page115" title="115">&nbsp;</a>It was twelve by the village clock</p>
	<p>When he crossed the bridge into Medford town.</p>
	<p>He heard the crowing of the cock,</p>
	<p>And the barking of the farmer&#8217;s dog,</p>
	<p>And felt the damp of the river fog,</p>
	<p>That rises when the sun goes down.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p>It was one by the village clock,</p>
	<p>When he rode into Lexington.</p>
	<p>He saw the gilded weathercock</p>
	<p>Swim in the moonlight as he passed,</p>
	<p>And the meeting-house windows, blank and bare,</p>
	<p>Gaze at him with a spectral stare,</p>
	<p>As if they already stood aghast</p>
	<p>At the bloody work they would look upon.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p>It was two by the village clock,</p>
	<p>When he came to the bridge in Concord town.</p>
	<p>He heard the bleating of the flock,</p>
	<p>And the twitter of the birds among the trees,</p>
	<p>And felt the breath of the morning breeze</p>
	<p>Blowing over the meadows brown.</p>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p>When the Norn-mother saw the Whirl-wind Hour,</p>
	<p>Greatening and darkening as it hurried on,</p>
	<p>She bent the strenuous heavens and came down</p>
	<p>To make a man to meet the mortal need.</p>
	<p>She took the tried clay of the common road,</p>
	<p>Clay warm yet with the genial heat of earth,</p>
	<p>Dashed through it all a strain of prophecy:</p>
	<p>Then mixed a laughter with the serious stuff,</p>
	<p>It was a stuff to wear for centuries,</p>
	<p>A man that matched the mountains and compelled</p>
	<p>The stars to look our way and honor us.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p>The color of the ground was in him, the red Earth</p>
	<p>The tang and odor of the primal things&#8212;</p>
	<p>The rectitude and patience of the rocks:</p>
	<p>The gladness of the wind that shakes the corn;</p>
	<p>The courage of the bird that dares the sea;</p>
	<p>The justice of the rain that loves all leaves;</p>
	<p>The pity of the snow that hides all scars;</p>
	<p>The loving kindness of the wayside well;</p>
	<p>The tolerance and equity of light</p>
	<p>That gives as freely to the shrinking weed</p>
	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page121" title="121">&nbsp;</a>As to the great oak flaring to the wind&#8212;</p>
	<p>To the grave&#8217;s low hill as to the Matterhorn</p>
	<p>That shoulders out the sky.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p class="i20">And so he came</p>
	<p>From prairie cabin up to Capitol,</p>
	<p>One fair Ideal led our chieftain on.</p>
	<p>Forevermore he burned to do his deed</p>
	<p>With the fine stroke and gesture of a king.</p>
	<p>He built the rail pile as he built the State,</p>
	<p>Pouring his splendid strength through every blow,</p>
	<p>The conscience of him testing every blow,</p>
	<p>To make his deed the measure of a man.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p>So came the captain with the mighty heart;</p>
	<p>And when the step of earthquake shook the house,</p>
	<p>Wrenching the rafters from their ancient hold,</p>
	<p>He held the ridge-pole up and spiked again</p>
	<p>The rafters of the Home. He held his place&#8212;</p>
	<p>Held the long purpose like a growing tree&#8212;</p>
	<p>Held on through blame and faltered not at praise.</p>
	<p>And when he fell in whirlwind, he went down</p>
	<p>As when a kingly cedar green with boughs</p>
	<p>Goes down with a great shout upon the hills.</p>

		<h3>THANATOPSIS.</h3>
	<div class="stanza">
	<p class="i2">To him who in the love of nature holds</p>
	<p>Communion with her visible forms, she speaks</p>
	<p>A various language; for his gayer hours</p>
	<p>She has a voice of gladness, and a smile</p>
	<p>And eloquence of beauty, and she glides</p>
	<p>Into his darker musings, with a mild</p>
	<p>And healing sympathy, that steals away</p>
	<p>Their sharpness, ere he is aware. When thoughts</p>
	<p>Of the last bitter hour come like a blight</p>
	<p>Over thy spirit, and sad images</p>
	<p>Of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall,</p>
	<p>And breathless darkness, and the narrow house,</p>
	<p>Make thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart&#8212;</p>
	<p>Go forth, under the open sky, and list</p>
	<p>To Nature&#8217;s teachings, while from all around&#8212;</p>
	<p>Earth and her waters, and the depths of air&#8212;</p>
	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page152" title="152">&nbsp;</a>Comes a still voice&#8212;Yet a few days, and thee</p>
	<p>The all-beholding sun shall see no more</p>
	<p>In all his course; nor yet in the cold ground,</p>
	<p>Where thy pale form was laid, with many tears,</p>
	<p>Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist</p>
	<p>Thy image.  Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim</p>
	<p>Thy growth, to be resolved to earth again,</p>
	<p>And, lost each human trace, surrendering up</p>
	<p>Thine individual being shalt thou go</p>
	<p>To mix forever with the elements.</p>
	<p>To be a brother to the insensible rock</p>
	<p>And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain</p>
	<p>Turns with his share, and treads upon. The oak</p>
	<p>Shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mould.</p>
	<p>Yet not to thine eternal resting-place</p>
	<p>Shalt thou retire alone&#8212;nor couldst thou wish</p>
	<p>Couch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down</p>
	<p>With patriarchs of the infant world&#8212;with kings,</p>
	<p>The powerful of the earth&#8212;the wise, the good,</p>
	<p>Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,</p>
	<p>All in one mighty sepulchre. The hills</p>
	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page153" title="153">&nbsp;</a>Book-ribbed and ancient as the sun&#8212;the vales</p>
	<p>Stretching in pensive quietness between;</p>
	<p>The venerable woods&#8212;rivers that move</p>
	<p>In majesty, and the complaining brooks</p>
	<p>That make the meadows green; and, poured round all,</p>
	<p>Old ocean&#8217;s gray and melancholy waste&#8212;</p>
	<p>Are but the solemn decorations all</p>
	<p>Of the great tomb of man. The golden sun,</p>
	<p>The planets, all the infinite host of heaven,</p>
	<p>Are shining on the sad abodes of death,</p>
	<p>Through the still lapse of ages. All that tread</p>
	<p>The globe are but a handful to the tribes</p>
	<p>That slumber in its bosom. Take the wings</p>
	<p>Of morning&#8212;and the Barcan desert pierce,</p>
	<p>Or lose thyself in the continuous woods</p>
	<p>Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound,</p>
	<p>Save his own dashings&#8212;yet&#8212;the dead are there;</p>
	<p>And millions in those solitudes, since first</p>
	<p>The flight of years began, have laid them down</p>
	<p>In their last sleep&#8212;the dead reign there alone.</p>
	<p>So shalt thou rest&#8212;and what if thou withdraw</p>
	<p>Unheeded by the living&#8212;and no friend</p>
	<p>Take note of thy departure? All that breathe</p>
	<p>Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh</p>
	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page154" title="154">&nbsp;</a>When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care</p>
	<p>Plod on, and each one as before will chase</p>
	<p>His favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave</p>
	<p>Their mirth and their employment, and shall come</p>
	<p>And make their bed with thee. As the long train</p>
	<p>Of ages glide away, the sons of men,</p>
	<p>The youth in life&#8217;s green spring, and he who goes</p>
	<p>In the full strength of years, matron, and maid,</p>
	<p>And the sweet babe, and the gray-headed man,</p>
	<p>Shall one by one be gathered to thy side,</p>
	<p>By those, who in their turn shall follow them.</p>
	<p>So live, that when thy summons comes to join</p>
	<p>The innumerable caravan, that moves</p>
	<p>To that mysterious realm, where each shall take</p>
	<p>His chamber in the silent halls of death,</p>
	<p>Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,</p>
	<p>Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed</p>
	<p>By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave,</p>
	<p>Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch</p>
	<p>About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.</p>

		<h3>SPEECH AT THE DEDICATION OF
		THE NATIONAL CEMETERY AT
		GETTYSBURG.</h3>

		<p class="item_subtitle">November 18, 1863.</p>

		<p>Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers
		brought forth upon this continent a new
		nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated
		to the proposition that all men are created
		equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil
		war, testing whether that nation, or any
		nation so conceived and so dedicated, can
		long endure. We are met on a great battlefield
		of that war. We have come to dedicate
		<a class="pagenum" id="page158" title="158">&nbsp;</a>a portion of that field as a final resting place
		for those who here gave their lives that that
		nation might live. It is altogether fitting
		and proper that we should do this. But in a
		larger sense we cannot dedicate, we cannot
		consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground.
		The brave men, living and dead, who struggled
		here, have consecrated it far above our
		power to add or detract. The world will
		little note, nor long remember what we say
		here; but it can never forget what they did
		here. It is for us, the living, rather to be
		dedicated here to the unfinished work which
		they who fought here have thus far so nobly
		advanced. It is rather for us, to be here
		dedicated to the great task remaining before
		us, that from these honored dead we take
		increased devotion to that cause for which
		they gave the last full measure of devotion;
		that we here highly resolve that these dead
		shall not have died in vain; that this nation,
		under God, shall have a new birth of freedom,
		and that government of the people, by
		the people, and for the people, shall not
		perish from the earth.</p>

		May 24, 1901</p>

		<p>&#8220;There is nothing better for the United
		States than <strong class="special_emphasis">Educated Citizenship</strong>; and,
		my young friends, there never was a time in
		all our history when knowledge was so essential
		to success as now. Everything requires
		knowledge. What we want of the young
		people now is exact knowledge. You want
		to know whatever you undertake to do a
		little better than anybody else. And if you
		will do that, then there is nothing that is not
		within your reach.</p>

		<p>And what you want besides education is
		<strong class="special_emphasis">Character</strong>&#8212;<strong class="special_emphasis">Character</strong>! There is nothing
		that will serve a young man or an old man so
		well as good character. And did you ever
		think that it is just as easy to form a good
		habit as it is to form a bad one; and it is
		just as hard to break a good habit as it is to
		break a bad one? So get the good ones and
		keep them. With <strong class="special_emphasis">Education</strong> and <strong class="special_emphasis">Character</strong>
		you will not only achieve individual
		success, but you will contribute largely to
		the progress of your country.&#8221;</p>

		<h3>POOR RICHARD&#8217;S SAYINGS.</h3>


		<p>God helps them that help themselves.</p>

		<p>The sleeping fox catches no poultry.</p>

		<p>What we call time enough always proves
		little enough.</p>

		<p>Sloth makes all things difficult, but industry
		all easy.</p>

		<p>Drive thy business, let not that drive thee.</p>

		<p>Early to bed and early to rise, makes a
		man healthy, wealthy, and wise.</p>

		<p>Industry needs not wish.</p>

		<p>He that lives upon hope will die fasting.</p>

		<p>He that hath a trade hath an estate, and
		he that hath a calling hath an office of profit
		and honor.</p>

		<p>Have you somewhat to do to-morrow, do
		it to-day.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page188" title="188">&nbsp;</a>God gives all things to industry: then
		plough deep while sluggards sleep, and you
		will have corn to sell and to keep.</p>

		<p>Keep thy shop, and thy shop will keep
		thee.</p>

		<p>If you would have your business done, go;
		if not, send.</p>

		<div class="poem">
		<p>He that by the plough would thrive,</p>
		<p>Himself must either hold or drive.</p>
		</div>

		<p>Silks and satins, scarlet and velvets put
		out the kitchen fire.</p>

		<p>For want of a nail the shoe was lost; for
		want of a shoe the horse was lost; and for
		want of a horse the rider was lost.</p>

		<p>Many a little makes a mickle.</p>

		<p>Fools make feasts, and wise men eat them.</p>

		<p>Wise men learn by others&#8217; harms, fools
		scarcely by their own.</p>

		<p>When the well is dry they know the worth
		of water.</p>

		<p>Pride is as loud a beggar as want, and a
		great deal more saucy.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page189" title="189">&nbsp;</a>A little neglect may breed great mischief.</p>

		<div class="poem">
		<p>Vessels large may venture more,</p>
		<p>But little boats should keep near shore.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="poem">
		<p>What is a butterfly? at best</p>
		<p>He&#8217;s but a caterpillar drest;</p>
		<p>The gaudy fop&#8217;s his picture just.</p>
		</div>

		<p>For age and want save while you may.</p>

		<p>No morning sun lasts a whole day.</p>

		<p>Rather go to bed supperless than rise in
		debt.</p>

		<p>Get what you can, and what you get, hold,
		&#8217;Tis the stone that will turn all your lead into gold.</p>

		<p>Experience keeps a dear school; but fools
		will learn in no other, and scarce in that;
		for it is true we may give advice, but we
		cannot give conduct.</p>

		<p>The key, often used, is always bright.</p>

		<p>But dost thou love life? then do not waste
		time, for that&#8217;s the stuff life is made of.</p>

		<p>Lost time is never found again.</p>

		<p>There are no gains without pains.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page190" title="190">&nbsp;</a>At the workingman&#8217;s house hunger looks
		in, but dares not enter.</p>

		<p>Diligence is the mother of good luck.</p>

		<p>The cat in gloves catches no mice.</p>

		<p>By industry and patience the mouse ate
		into the cable.</p>

		<p>Since thou art not sure of a minute, throw
		not away an hour.</p>

		<p>A workingman on his legs is higher than a
		gentleman on his knees.</p>

		<p>It is folly for the frog to swell in order to
		equal the ox.</p>

		<p>It is easier to build two chimneys than to
		keep one in fuel.</p>

		<p>A fool and his money are soon parted.</p>

		<p>Troubles spring from idleness, and grievous
		toils from needless ease.</p>

		<p>If you would be wealthy think of saving
		as well as of getting.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
