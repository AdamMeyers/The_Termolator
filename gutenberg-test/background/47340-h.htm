<p>One of the most frightening and
destructive phenomena of nature
is a severe earthquake and its terrible
aftereffects. An earthquake is a sudden
movement of the Earth, caused by
the abrupt release of strain that has accumulated
over a long time. For hundreds
of millions of years, the forces of plate
tectonics have shaped the Earth as the
huge plates that form the Earth&rsquo;s surface
slowly move over, under, and past each
other. Sometimes the movement is gradual.
At other times, the plates are locked
together, unable to release the accumulating
energy. When the accumulated
energy grows strong enough, the plates
break free. If the earthquake occurs in
a populated area, it may cause many
deaths and injuries and extensive property
damage.</p>
<p>Today we are challenging the
assumption that earthquakes must present
an uncontrollable and unpredictable
hazard to life and property. Scientists
have begun to estimate the locations and
likelihoods of future damaging earthquakes.
Sites of greatest hazard are being
identified, and definite progress is being
made in designing structures that will
withstand the effects of earthquakes.</p>

<h2 id="c1">Earthquakes in History</h2>
<p>The scientific study of earthquakes
is comparatively new. Until the
18th century, few factual descriptions
of earthquakes were recorded, and
the natural cause of earthquakes was little
understood. Those who did look for
natural causes often reached conclusions
that seem fanciful today; one popular
theory was that earthquakes were caused
by air rushing out of caverns deep in the
Earth&rsquo;s interior.</p>
<p>The earliest earthquake for which
we have descriptive information
occurred in China in 1177 B.C. The
Chinese earthquake catalog describes
several dozen large earthquakes in China
during the next few thousand years.
Earthquakes in Europe are mentioned as
early as 580 B.C., but the earliest for
which we have some descriptive information
occurred in the mid-16th century.
The earliest known earthquakes in the
Americas were in Mexico in the late
14th century and in Peru in 1471, but
descriptions of the effects were not well
documented. By the 17th century, descriptions
of the effects of earthquakes
were being published around the
world&mdash;although these accounts were
often exaggerated or distorted.</p>
<p>The most widely felt earthquakes in
the recorded history of North America
were a series that occurred in 1811-12
near New Madrid, Mo. A great earthquake,
whose magnitude is estimated to
be about 8, occurred on the morning of
December 16, 1811. Another great earthquake
occurred on January 23, 1812, and
a third, the strongest yet, on February 7,
1812. Aftershocks were nearly continuous
between these great earthquakes and
continued for months afterwards. These
earthquakes were felt by people as far
away as Boston and Denver. Because the
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
most intense effects were in a sparsely
populated region, the destruction of
human life and property was slight. If
just one of these enormous earthquakes
occurred in the same area today, millions
of people and buildings and other structures
worth billions of dollars would be
affected.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="small"><i>The great 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire destroyed most of the city and left 250,000 people homeless.</i></span></p>
</div>
<p>The San Francisco earthquake of
1906 was one of the most destructive in
the recorded history of North America&mdash;the
earthquake and the fire that followed
killed nearly 700 people and left the city
in ruins. The Alaska earthquake of
March 27, 1964, was of greater magnitude
than the San Francisco earthquake;
it released perhaps twice as much energy
and was felt over an area of almost
500,000 square miles. The ground
motion near the epicenter was so violent
that the tops of some trees were snapped
off. One hundred and fourteen people
(some as far away as California) died as
a result of this earthquake, but loss of
life and property would have been far
greater had Alaska been more densely
populated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<h2 id="c2">Where Earthquakes Occur</h2>
<p>The Earth is formed of several layers
that have very different physical
and chemical properties. The
outer layer, which averages about 70
kilometers in thickness, consists of about
a dozen large, irregularly shaped plates
that slide over, under, and past each
other on top of the partly molten inner
layer. Most earthquakes occur at the
boundaries where the plates meet. In
fact, the locations of earthquakes and the
kinds of ruptures they produce help scientists
define the plate boundaries.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_4">
<img src="images/p005.jpg" alt="Diagram of plate boundaries and earthquake locations." width="500" height="352" />
</div>
<p>There are three types of plate
boundaries: spreading zones, transform
faults, and subduction zones. At <i>spreading
zones</i>, molten rock rises, pushing
two plates apart and adding new material
at their edges. Most spreading zones are
found in oceans; for example, the North
American and Eurasian plates are
spreading apart along the mid-Atlantic
ridge. Spreading zones usually have
earthquakes at shallow depths (within 30
kilometers of the surface).</p>
<p><i>Transform faults</i> are found where
plates slide past one another. An example
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
of a transform-fault plate boundary is the
San Andreas fault, along the coast of
California and northwestern Mexico.
Earthquakes at transform faults tend to
occur at shallow depths and form fairly
straight linear patterns.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_5">
<img src="images/p006.jpg" alt="Map explanation: yellow lines, plate Boundary." width="500" height="345" />
</div>
<p><i>Subduction zones</i> are found where
one plate overrides, or subducts, another,
pushing it downward into the mantle
where it melts. An example of a subduction-zone
plate boundary is found along
the northwest coast of the United States,
western Canada, and southern Alaska
and the Aleutian Islands. Subduction
zones are characterized by deep-ocean
trenches, shallow to deep earthquakes,
and mountain ranges containing active
volcanoes.</p>
<p>Earthquakes can also occur within
plates, although plate-boundary earthquakes
are much more common. Less
than 10 percent of all earthquakes occur
within plate interiors. As plates continue
to move and plate boundaries change
over geologic time, weakened boundary
regions become part of the interiors of
the plates. These zones of weakness
within the continents can cause earthquakes
in response to stresses that originate
at the edges of the plate or in the
deeper crust. The New Madrid earthquakes
of 1811-12 and the 1886
Charleston earthquake occurred within
the North American plate.</p>

<h2 id="c3">How Earthquakes Happen</h2>
<p>An earthquake is the vibration,
sometimes violent, of the Earth&rsquo;s
surface that follows a release of
energy in the Earth&rsquo;s crust. This energy
can be generated by a sudden dislocation
of segments of the crust, by a volcanic
eruption, or even by manmade explosions.
Most destructive quakes, however,
are caused by dislocations of the crust.
The crust may first bend and then, when
the stress exceeds the strength of the
rocks, break and &ldquo;snap&rdquo; to a new position.
In the process of breaking, vibrations
called &ldquo;seismic waves&rdquo; are generated.
These waves travel outward from the
source of the earthquake along the surface
and through the Earth at varying
speeds depending on the material
through which they move. Some of the
vibrations are of high enough frequency
to be audible, while others are of very
low frequency. These vibrations cause
the entire planet to quiver or ring like a
bell or a tuning fork.</p>
<p>A <i>fault</i> is a fracture in the Earth&rsquo;s
crust along which two blocks of the crust
have slipped with respect to each other.
Faults are divided into three main
groups, depending on how they move.
<i>Normal faults</i> occur in response to
pulling or tension; the overlying block
moves down the dip of the fault plane.
<i>Thrust (reverse) faults</i> occur in response
to squeezing or compression; the overlying
block moves up the dip of the fault
plane. <i>Strike-slip (lateral) faults</i> occur in
response to either type of stress; the
blocks move horizontally past one another.
Most faulting along spreading zones
is normal, along subduction zones is
thrust, and along transform faults is
strike-slip.</p>

<p>Geologists have found that earthquakes
tend to reoccur along faults,
which reflect zones of weakness in the
Earth&rsquo;s crust. Even if a fault zone has
recently experienced an earthquake,
however, there is no guarantee that all
the stress has been relieved. Another
earthquake could still occur. In New
Madrid, a great earthquake was followed
by a large aftershock within 6 hours on
December 16, 1811. Furthermore, relieving
stress along one part of the fault may
increase stress in another part; the New
Madrid earthquakes in January and
February 1812 may have resulted from
this phenomenon.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>The <i>focal depth</i> of an earthquake is
the depth from the Earth&rsquo;s surface to the
region where an earthquake&rsquo;s energy
originates (the <i>focus</i>). Earthquakes with
focal depths from the surface to about 70
kilometers (43.5 miles) are classified as
shallow. Earthquakes with focal depths
from 70 to 300 kilometers (43.5 to 186
miles) are classified as intermediate. The
focus of deep earthquakes may reach
depths of more than 700 kilometers (435
miles). The focuses of most earthquakes
are concentrated in the crust and upper
mantle. The depth to the center of the
Earth&rsquo;s core is about 6,370 kilometers
(3,960 miles), so even the deepest earthquakes
originate in relatively shallow
parts of the Earth&rsquo;s interior.</p>
<p>The <i>epicenter</i> of an earthquake is
the point on the Earth&rsquo;s surface directly
above the focus. The location of an
earthquake is commonly described by
the geographic position of its epicenter
and by its focal depth.</p>
<p>Earthquakes beneath the ocean floor
sometimes generate immense sea waves
or tsunamis (Japan&rsquo;s dread &ldquo;huge
wave&rdquo;). These waves travel across the
ocean at speeds as great as 960 kilometers
per hour (597 miles per hour) and
may be 15 meters (49 feet) high or higher
by the time they reach the shore.
During the 1964 Alaska earthquake,
tsunamis engulfing coastal areas caused
most of the destruction at Kodiak,
Cordova, and Seward and caused severe
damage along the west coast of North
America, particularly at Crescent City,
Calif. Some waves raced across the
ocean to the coasts of Japan.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p><i>Liquefaction</i>, which happens when
loosely packed, water-logged sediments
lose their strength in response to strong
shaking, causes major damage during
earthquakes. During the 1989 Loma
Prieta earthquake, liquefaction of the
soils and debris used to fill in a lagoon
caused major subsidence, fracturing, and
horizontal sliding of the ground surface
in the Marina district in San Francisco.</p>

<p>Landslides triggered by earthquakes
often cause more destruction than the
earthquakes themselves. During the 1964
Alaska quake, shock-induced landslides
devastated the Turnagain Heights residential
development and many downtown
areas in Anchorage. An observer
gave a vivid report of the breakup of the
unstable earth materials in the Turnagain
Heights region: <i>I got out of my car, ran
northward toward my driveway, and then
saw that the bluff had broken back
approximately 300 feet southward from
its original edge. Additional slumping of
the bluff caused me to return to my car
and back southward approximately 180
feet to the corner of McCollie and
Turnagain Parkway. The bluff slowly
broke until the corner of Turnagain
Parkway and McCollie had slumped
northward.</i></p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<h2 id="c4">Measuring Earthquakes</h2>
<p>The vibrations produced by earthquakes
are detected, recorded, and
measured by instruments called
seismographs. The zig-zag line made by
a seismograph, called a &ldquo;seismogram,&rdquo;
reflects the changing intensity of the
vibrations by responding to the motion
of the ground surface beneath the instrument.
From the data expressed in seismograms,
scientists can determine the
time, the epicenter, the focal depth, and
the type of faulting of an earthquake and
can estimate how much energy was
released.</p>
<p>The two general types of vibrations
produced by earthquakes are <i>surface
waves</i>, which travel along the Earth&rsquo;s
surface, and <i>body waves</i>, which travel
through the Earth. Surface waves usually
have the strongest vibrations and probably
cause most of the damage done by
earthquakes.</p>
<p>Body waves are of two types, <i>compressional</i>
and <i>shear</i>. Both types pass
through the Earth&rsquo;s interior from the
focus of an earthquake to distant points
on the surface, but only compressional
waves travel through the Earth&rsquo;s molten
core. Because compressional waves travel
at great speeds and ordinarily reach
the surface first, they are often called
&ldquo;primary waves&rdquo; or simply &ldquo;P&rdquo; waves. P
waves push tiny particles of Earth material
directly ahead of them or displace the
particles directly behind their line of
travel.</p>
<p>Shear waves do not travel as rapidly
through the Earth&rsquo;s crust and mantle as
do compressional waves, and because
they ordinarily reach the surface later
they are called &ldquo;secondary&rdquo; or &ldquo;S&rdquo;
waves. Instead of affecting material
directly behind or ahead of their line of
travel, shear waves displace material at
right angles to their path and are therefore
sometimes called &ldquo;transverse&rdquo;
waves.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_16">
<img src="images/p017.jpg" alt="Diagram of propagation of seismic waves." width="500" height="324" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>The first indication of an earthquake
is often a sharp thud, signaling the arrival
of compressional waves. This is followed
by the shear waves and then the &ldquo;ground
roll&rdquo; caused by the surface waves. A
geologist who was at Valdez, Alaska,
during the 1964 earthquake described
this sequence: <i>The first tremors were
hard enough to stop a moving person,
and shock waves were immediately
noticeable on the surface of the ground.
These shock waves continued with a
rather long frequency, which gave the
observer an impression of a rolling feeling
rather than abrupt hard jolts. After
about 1 minute the amplitude or strength
of the shock waves increased in intensity
and failures in buildings as well as the
frozen ground surface began to occur....
After about 3&frac12; minutes the severe
shock waves ended and people began to
react as could be expected.</i></p>
<div class="img" id="pic_17">
<img src="images/p018.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="267" />
<p class="caption"><span class="small"><i>Large earthquakes cause more damage east of the Rocky Mountains; this map shows areas that suffered major architectural damage (striped areas) and minor damage (dotted areas) during the magnitude-8 earthquakes in New Madrid and San Francisco and the smaller but still damaging quakes in Charleston and San Fernando.</i></span></p>
</div>
<p>The severity of an earthquake can be
expressed in several ways. The <i>magnitude</i>
of an earthquake, usually expressed
by the <i>Richter Scale</i>, is a measure of the
amplitude of the seismic waves. The
<i>moment magnitude</i> of an earthquake is a
measure of the amount of energy
released&mdash;an
amount that
can be estimated
from
seismograph
recordings.
The <i>intensity</i>,
as expressed
by the <i>Modified
Mercalli
Scale</i>, is a
subjective
measure that
describes
how strong a
shock was
felt at a
particular location.</p>
<p>The Richter Scale, named after Dr.
Charles F. Richter of the California
Institute of Technology, is the best known
scale for measuring the magnitude of
earthquakes. The scale is logarithmic so
that a recording of 7, for example, indicates
a disturbance with ground motion
10 times as large as a recording of 6. A
quake of magnitude 2 is the smallest
quake normally felt by people. Earthquakes
with a Richter value of 6 or more
are commonly considered major; great
earthquakes have magnitudes of 8 or
more on the Richter scale.</p>
<p>The Modified Mercalli Scale expresses
the intensity of an earthquake&rsquo;s
effects in a given locality in values ranging
from I to XII. The most commonly
used adaptation covers the range of intensity
from the condition of &ldquo;I&mdash;Not felt
except by a very few under especially
favorable conditions,&rdquo; to &ldquo;XII&mdash;Damage
total. Lines of sight and level are distorted.
Objects thrown upward into the air.&rdquo;
Evaluation of earthquake intensity can be
made only after eyewitness reports and
results of field investigations are studied
and interpreted. The maximum intensity
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
experienced in the Alaska earthquake of
1964 was X; damage from the San
Francisco and New Madrid earthquakes
reached a maximum intensity of XI.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_18">

<p class="caption"><span class="small"><i>The January 17, 1994, earthquake at Northridge, California, caused this collapse of a major highway interchange.</i> (Photograph by James W. Dewey, USGS.)</span></p>
</div>
<p>Earthquakes of large magnitude do
not necessarily cause the most intense
surface effects. The effect in a given
region depends to a large degree on local
surface and subsurface geologic conditions.
An area underlain by unstable
ground (sand, clay, or other unconsolidated
materials), for example, is likely to
experience much more noticeable effects
than an area equally distant from an
earthquake&rsquo;s epicenter but underlain by
firm ground such as granite. In general,
earthquakes east of the Rocky Mountains
affect a much larger area than earthquakes
west of the Rockies.</p>
<p>An earthquake&rsquo;s destructiveness
depends on many factors. In addition to
magnitude and the local geologic conditions,
these factors include the focal
depth, the distance from the epicenter,
and the design of buildings and other
structures. The extent of damage also
depends on the density of population and
construction in the area shaken by the
quake.</p>
<p>The Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989
demonstrated a wide range of effects.
The Santa Cruz mountains suffered little
damage from the seismic waves, even
though they were close to the epicenter.
The central core of the city of Santa
Cruz, about 24 kilometers (15 miles)
away from the epicenter, was almost
completely destroyed. More than 80
kilometers (50 miles) away, the cities of
San Francisco and Oakland suffered
selective but severe damage, including
the loss of more than 40 lives. The greatest
destruction occurred in areas where
roads and elevated structures were built
on unstable ground underlain by loose,
unconsolidated soils.</p>
<p>The Northridge, California, earthquake
of 1994 also produced a wide
variety of effects, even over distances of
just a few hundred meters. Some buildings
collapsed, while adjacent buildings
of similar age and construction remained
standing. Similarly, some highway spans
collapsed, while others nearby did not.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h2 id="c5">Volcanoes and Earthquakes</h2>
<p>Earthquakes are associated with
volcanic eruptions. Abrupt
increases in earthquake activity
heralded eruptions at Mount St. Helens,
Washington; Mount Spurr and Redoubt
Volcano, Alaska; and Kilauea and Mauna
Loa, Hawaii. The location and movement
of swarms of tremors indicate the
movement of magma through the volcano.
Continuous records of seismic and
tiltmeter (a device that measures ground
tilting) data are maintained at U.S.
Geological Survey volcano observatories
in Hawaii, Alaska, California, and the
Cascades, where study of these records
enables specialists to make short-range
predictions of volcanic eruptions. These
warnings have been especially effective
in Alaska, where the imminent eruption
of a volcano requires the rerouting of
international air traffic to enable airplanes
to avoid volcanic clouds. Since
1982, at least seven jumbo jets, carrying
more than 1,500 passengers, have lost
power in the air after flying into clouds
of volcanic ash. Though all flights were
able to restart their engines eventually
and no lives were lost, the aircraft suffered
damages of tens of millions of dollars.
As a result of these close calls, an
international team of volcanologists,
meteorologists, dispatchers, pilots, and
controllers have begun to work together
to alert each other to imminent volcanic
eruptions and to detect and track volcanic
ash clouds.</p>
<h2 id="c6">Predicting Earthquakes</h2>
<p>The goal of earthquake prediction
is to give warning of potentially
damaging earthquakes early
enough to allow appropriate response to
the disaster, enabling people to minimize
loss of life and property. The U.S.
Geological Survey conducts and supports
research on the likelihood of future
earthquakes. This research includes field,
laboratory, and theoretical investigations
of earthquake mechanisms and fault
zones. A primary goal of earthquake
research is to increase the reliability of
earthquake probability estimates.
Ultimately, scientists would like to be
able to specify a high probability for a
specific earthquake on a particular fault
within a particular year. Scientists estimate
earthquake probabilities in two
ways: by studying the history of large
earthquakes in a specific area and the
rate at which strain accumulates in the
rock.</p>
<p>Scientists study the past frequency
of large earthquakes in order to determine
the future likelihood of similar
large shocks. For example, if a region
has experienced four magnitude 7 or
larger earthquakes during 200 years of
recorded history, and if these shocks
occurred randomly in time, then scientists
would assign a 50 percent probability
(that is, just as likely to happen as not
to happen) to the occurrence of another
magnitude 7 or larger quake in the
region during the next 50 years.</p>
<p>But in many places, the assumption
of random occurrence with time may not
be true, because when the strain is
released along one part of the fault system,
it may actually increase on another
part. Four magnitude 6.8 or larger earthquakes
and many magnitude 6-6.5
shocks occurred in the San Francisco
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
Bay region during the 75 years between
1836 and 1911. For the next 68 years
(until 1979), no earthquakes of magnitude
6 or larger occurred in the region.
Beginning with a magnitude 6.0 shock in
1979, the earthquake activity in the
region increased dramatically; between
1979 and 1989, there were four magnitude
6 or greater earthquakes, including
the magnitude 7.1 Loma Prieta earthquake.
This clustering of earthquakes
leads scientists to estimate that the probability
of a magnitude 6.8 or larger earthquake
occurring during the next 30 years
in the San Francisco Bay region is about
67 percent (twice as likely as not).</p>
<p>Another way to estimate the likelihood
of future earthquakes is to study
how fast strain accumulates. When plate
movements build the strain in rocks to a
critical level, like pulling a rubber band
too tight, the rocks will suddenly break
and slip to a new position. Scientists
measure how much strain accumulates
along a fault segment each year, how
much time has passed since the last
earthquake along the segment, and how
much strain was released in the last
earthquake. This information is then
used to calculate the time required for
the accumulating strain to build to the
level that results in an earthquake. This
simple model is complicated by the fact
that such detailed information about
faults is rare. In the United States, only
the San Andreas fault system has adequate
records for using this prediction
method.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="small"><i>Using a two-color laser to detect movement along a fault near Parkfield, California.</i></span></p>
</div>
<p>Both of these methods, and a wide
array of monitoring techniques, are being
tested along part of the San Andreas
fault. For the past 150 years, earthquakes
of about magnitude 6 have occurred an
average of every 22 years on the San
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
Andreas fault near Parkfield, California.
The last shock was in 1966. Because of
the consistency and similarity of these
earthquakes, scientists have started an
experiment to &ldquo;capture&rdquo; the next Parkfield
earthquake. A dense web of monitoring
instruments was deployed in the
region during the late 1980s. The main
goals of the ongoing Parkfield Earthquake
Prediction Experiment are to record
the geophysical signals before and
after the expected earthquake; to issue a
short-term prediction; and to develop
effective methods of communication
between earthquake scientists and community
officials responsible for disaster
response and mitigation. This project has
already made important contributions to
both earth science and public policy.</p>

<p>Scientific understanding of earthquakes
is of vital importance to the Nation. As the
population increases, expanding urban
development and construction works
encroach upon areas susceptible to earthquakes.
With a greater understanding of
the causes and effects of earthquakes, we
may be able to reduce damage and loss of
life from this destructive phenomenon.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
