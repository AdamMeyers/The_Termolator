THE PREFACE


Art supervisors in the public schools assign picture-study
work in each grade, recommending the study of certain pictures
by well-known masters. As Supervisor of Drawing I found
that the children enjoyed this work but that the teachers felt
incompetent to conduct the lessons as they lacked time to
look up the subject and to gather adequate material. Recourse
to a great many books was necessary and often while
much information could usually be found about the artist,
very little was available about his pictures.

Hence I began collecting information about the pictures
and preparing the lessons for the teachers just as I would
give them myself to pupils of their grade.

My plan does not include many pictures during the year,
as this is to be only a part of the art work and is not intended
to take the place of drawing.

The lessons in this grade may be used for the usual drawing
period of from twenty to thirty minutes, and have been successfully
given in that time. However, the most satisfactory way
of using the books is as supplementary readers, thus permitting
each child to study the pictures and read the stories himself.

[Pg 2]
Original Picture: Vanderbilt Collection, Metropolitan Museum, New York.
Artist: Jean Fran        ois Millet (m             l                    ).
Birthplace: Gruchy, France.
Dates: Born, 1814; died, 1875.



The story of the picture. In this picture
Millet has tried to tell us only a few important
facts about the man and his work. It is easy
to see that he is sowing grain broadcast over the
field. The shadows creeping over ground and
sky tell us that night is fast approaching. He
seems intent upon finishing that last stretch
of field before dark, and his steady, rhythmic
swing shows none of the physical weariness he
must feel.

When we think of the life of this sturdy
French peasant, as the artist surely intended
we should, we realize the patience and perseverance
required in the monotonous day's
work, and we are forced to a feeling of respect
and admiration for him.

In these days with what ease and skill the
same task is performed by the aid of machinery!
Riding on the seat of a machine which drills
the seed into the ground and covers it up, the
man would have found the simple task of
guiding his horses a very pleasant one indeed.
As he walks along so energetically, his eyes
are probably fixed on some stake at the end[Pg 3]
of the field to guide him as he travels back
and forth, sowing the grain.

No doubt he used a team of oxen to plow
and harrow the ground before he sowed the seed.
We have no way of knowing just what kind of
a harrow he had, but very likely it was one
made of brush or branches of trees. We can
see a team of oxen and a driver in the distance,
who seem to be following in the tracks of our
sower and covering up the seeds he is sowing.

The artist, Millet, knew all about such work,
for he himself had worked out in the fields
through the long day. He tells us that his
"ancestors were peasants and he was born a
peasant."

No doubt the man in our picture started out
on his day's work long before the sun was up.
His first task, after eating his breakfast and
feeding his oxen, was to yoke the oxen ready
for the journey to the field where their work
was to be done. No doubt the man has been
working steadily ever since, for he does not
look like a man who would stop to rest very
many times. He gives us rather a feeling of
physical strength and of steady, faithful effort
in the accomplishment of his daily tasks.

At the close of such a day's labor in the
field he will be too utterly weary to sit up and
read, as most of our farmers do during these[Pg 4]
days of farm machinery and rural delivery.
And yet, there were some who did read even
in those days when work was so difficult, for
we know that Millet sat up many nights with
the village priest, who taught him reading
and arithmetic, and with whom he studied
Latin and read the works of Shakespeare. It
was due to this greater knowledge that Millet
became something more than a mere peasant.
It was this that gave him such perfect sympathy
with and keen insight into the peasants' lives.
His own knowledge of the world made him
more conscious of the great contrast between
their narrow, hard-working lives so full of privation,
and those of the men and women in the
great world outside so full of opportunity and
promise. Yet even in so great a city as Paris,
men could starve, as he had found out by his
own experience.

Perhaps Millet wished to make us feel the
content of a successful day's work such as this,
with its well-earned quiet and rest, free from
the hurry and noise of the city. Although the
sun is sinking over a world of beauty and
pleasure, our sower knows nothing and cares
for nothing except the accomplishment of his
task. His hat, pulled down over his face,
shades his heavy, coarse features. Although an
expert in his work, doing to the utmost, his[Pg 5]
mind is probably dull and slow and quite unequal
to any great mental task. And yet what a
great work is his, after all! How dependent
we are upon the men of whom he is a type!
The fact that he is doing his own work and
doing that work well compels our respect and
admiration.

The light from the sun disappearing behind
the hill brings out in silhouette the figure of the
sower turned toward the dark and earthy field.
This man is not posing for his picture. Quite
unconscious of our gaze, he swings briskly
forward, his feet sinking slightly into the newly
plowed field. From the bag hanging from his
shoulder he scatters the grain with a long sweep
of his strong right arm.

He is actually moving in the picture. Take
this position for yourself. The weight of the
body falls evenly upon both feet. To raise
either foot you must move the entire body.
As the right foot goes forward the right arm
goes back. If you try taking long strides and
swinging your arms you will find this is the
natural movement.

The horizon line is slanting or diagonal, and
divides the light part of the picture from the
dark. The sky and ground are held together
by the figure of the sower. Notice the absence
of details in the picture.

[Pg 6]The art critics of Millet's day did not
appreciate the great thought expressed in this
picture, for nearly all of them found fault with
it. They could see no beauty in "a common
laborer in his dirty clothes doing his miserable
work," and thought Millet should have chosen
something more beautiful to paint. What do
you think of the justice of this criticism? What
is your opinion of the beauty of this picture?
Millet loved these simple, kind-hearted, hard-working
peasants, loved their lives of toil in the
fields, respected their labors, and being so wholly
in sympathy with them, he wished to make us
feel so, too.


Questions to help the pupil understand the
picture. Where is the man? in what country?
How can you tell what time of the day it is?
Why does he not seem weary? Why do you
think he must be very tired? How early do
the French peasants usually start to work?
What must this man do before daybreak?
Why do you think he is not lazy? Why do
we respect and admire him? How could his
work be made easier now? How do most of
our farmers sow and plant their seed? How
did this man plow his ground? What is a
harrow for? What kind of a harrow did this
man have? What is the team of oxen at the
farther end of the field doing? Does this man
seem to be looking at the ground or far ahead?
How did the artist, Millet, know so much about[Pg 7]
this kind of work? What would this man probably
do after his day's work? Why did he
not read the newspaper, as our farmers do?
What did Millet do in the evening? How did
this help him? What did Millet wish to make
us feel in this picture? How does the horizon
line divide the picture? How are the sky and
ground held together? Why do you suppose
Millet did not paint details, such as the features
of the face or the buttons on the coat? What
did the critics say about this picture? How
many agree with them? why? why not?


To the Teacher: Ask one of the pupils to
take this position while the others sketch the
action, finishing the sketch from memory       and
adding their own background. Use ink
silhouette, or charcoal on manila paper.


The story of the artist. Jean Fran        ois Millet
was the son of poor French peasants who lived
on a farm and worked hard to take care of their
large family of eight children. Jean was the
eldest boy. The father was very fond of music
and of all beautiful things out of doors, and
often he would say to his son, "Look at that
tree, how large and beautiful! It is as beautiful
as a flower." He would call the boy's attention
to the beauty of the fields, the sunsets, and all
things around them.

Millet's mother worked out in the fields
with the father all day long, so it was the[Pg 8]
grandmother who took care of the little boy.
It was she who named him Jean after his father,
and Fran        ois after the good Saint Francis. She
was a deeply religious woman, and nearly all
the pictures Millet saw when a boy were those
in her Bible. He copied these pictures many
times, drawing them with white chalk on the
stone walls of the house. This pleased his
grandmother very much, and she encouraged
him all she could.

At the age of six he was sent to school.
When he was twelve years old, the priest of the
village became interested in him and offered to
teach him Latin. Millet was only too glad to
accept this offer, and many a happy evening the
two spent thus together. But his studies were
frequently interrupted by his work on the farm,
for since he was the eldest son his father
depended most upon him. It was the custom
in France among the peasants to take a daily
hour of rest from their labors. But the boy
Millet, instead of sleeping, spent the hour in
drawing the homely scenes around him.

One Sunday morning, coming home from
church, Millet met an old man who walked
very slowly, his back bent over a cane. We
have all seen just such old men, and their feebleness
has aroused our sympathy and respect. It
is not strange, then, that something about this[Pg 9]
bent figure appealed to young Millet so strongly
that he could not resist the desire to draw a
portrait of the man.

He drew the portrait on a stone wall,
with a piece of charcoal, and so well that
people passing on their way home from church
recognized it at once and were very much
surprised and pleased. His father, perhaps,
was the most delighted of all, for once he
himself had wished to be an artist. Now he
determined that his son should have the chance.

We are sure Millet never forgot that day
when the father, mother, grandmother, and
his brothers and sisters sat around the table
after dinner and talked about his wonderful
picture and what they could do to help him
become a great painter. And when it was finally
decided that his father should take him to
the artist (Mouchel) in the next village, you
may be sure he worked hard on the drawings
he was to take with him. At last the day
came for the journey, and the proud father
and his happy son set out on foot for the
home of the artist.

When shown the drawings Mouchel at first
refused to believe the boy had made them,
they were so good. Finally convinced, he was
glad indeed to take Millet as one of his pupils.
But Millet studied with him only two months[Pg 10]
when his father died and he was obliged to
return home to take his father's place on the
farm as best he could.

By this time the people of the village had
become so much interested in his paintings that
they decided to help him. So they raised a
large sum of money, sent him back to the
artist to study, and finally sent him to the great
city of Paris, France. But although he painted
wonderful pictures which are worth thousands
of dollars to-day, his style of art was not appreciated
then and would not sell, and he was
glad to paint portraits for a few francs each
in order to make a living. His life in Paris
was a continuous struggle with poverty, and
at last he decided to leave. With his wife and
children he settled in a little three-roomed
cottage at Barbizon, a tiny little village near a
great forest and only a day's journey from
Paris.

Here was Millet's home all the rest of his
life. Although still very poor, the family did
not starve, as they came so near doing while
they lived in Paris, for the garden and the fruit
trees always provided them with something
to eat.

At that time the popular artists were painting
beautiful pictures of lovely women and
men of the nobility in their fine clothes, or of[Pg 11]
wonderful saints and angels, and pictures showing
only the happier side of life. To them
Millet's pictures came as a shock, bringing to
mind the dirt and grime of the common, everyday
tasks of the poorer French peasants. And,
more than that, he made them realize the
dreadful condition in which the French Revolution
had left many of these same peasants,
and that was something of which they did not
care to be reminded. So they refused to buy
his pictures, and it was not until the last ten
years of his life that Millet received a little of
the recognition and honor that he so richly deserved.
With his increasing fame came better
financial conditions, and in 1867 he received
the ribbon of the Legion of Honor.


Questions about the artist. Who painted
this picture? In what country did he live?
Tell about his mother and father. Who took
care of Millet when he was a boy? What
pictures did he copy? Where did he draw
them? With what did he draw? Who
encouraged him? What did the priest teach
him? Tell about the picture of the old man
leaning on the cane. Where did he draw this
picture? Who saw it? Why do you think it
must have been a good likeness? How did
Millet's father feel about it? What did he do?
How did they travel? What did the artist
think? How long did Millet study with him?
Why did he return home? What did his[Pg 12]
neighbors do for him? What was he obliged
to paint for a living? Where did he move?
What kind of pictures were the popular artists
of that day painting? Why were Millet's
pictures not popular? When were his pictures
appreciated? Why have his pictures outlived
those of the popular artists of that time?

HIGHLAND SHEPHERD'S
CHIEF MOURNER

Questions to arouse interest. What do
you see in this picture? For whom is the dog
grieving? What makes you think the shepherd
may have been an old man? a religious man?
a lonely man? Is there anything in the picture
that would suggest the country in which he
lived? What is there in the picture to suggest
the time of the year? the occupation of the
man? What kind of dog is this? Who painted
the picture? Tell something about his life.
Do you like this picture? How does it make
you feel?

[Pg 14]
Original Picture: South Kensington Museum, London.
Artist: Sir Edwin Landseer (l      nd              s      r).
Birthplace: London, England.
Dates: Born, 1802; died, 1873.



The story of the picture. Here we are
looking into the interior of a highland shepherd's
hut. Our eyes are immediately attracted
to the center of the room, where we see the
coffin of the shepherd covered with a blanket
against which his dog keeps solitary watch. A
well-worn Bible and a pair of glasses on the
stool near by, the hat, the cane, all suggest
something of the life and age of the shepherd.
We are told that he was a very old man who
had lived all his life among the hills of Scotland.
For the last few years, at least, he had lived
here alone except for the companionship of his
faithful dog and his sheep.

The good old dog could tell you all about it.
How, early in the morning, he would go with his
master to drive the sheep to the best grazing
ground, where all day long they guarded and
watched them, the man and the dog sharing
their noonday lunch of coarse bread. And why
did they need to watch the sheep so carefully?
There were a great many eagles whose nests
were high up in the giant oak trees or up in
some rocky cliff far away, and they came[Pg 15]
flying over the hills looking for food. Woe to
the sheep if their master was not near to care
for them, for then an eagle would swoop down
upon his choice and carry it away to his nest.
Then, too, there may have been wild animals
prowling about, and the sheep must be protected
from them. The dog and his master
also had to keep watch lest some lamb stray
away from the flock and get lost.

In the evening the dog helped his master
drive the sheep to shelter in the great sheds
where they were kept safe all night. Then up
the hill they would climb to their home, where
the shepherd prepared the simple evening meal
for himself and his dog. Now what could they
do after supper? It was too far for the old
man to go to the distant village, and no one
was likely to come in to see them. No doubt,
too, he was very tired, and ready to go to bed
very early. You know how sleepy you are
after you have been out in the fields all day
long. But first he read a little in his Bible;
and when the dog saw his master take up the
book and put on his spectacles, he probably
stretched out on the floor and kept very still.

As time went on, the old man became more
feeble and the dog worked all the harder to
save his master's strength. It may be that
toward the last the dog did almost all the work[Pg 16]
of caring for the sheep. Then, one morning, the
old shepherd did not wake up. Even the tugging
and sharp barks of his faithful friend failed
to arouse him. It may be that the dog's barks
brought some passing drovers to the door.

In the picture the dog presses close to the
coffin. His clinging paws have dragged the
blanket to the floor. His eyes seem full of
tears of hopeless grief, as if he understood his
master could not come back. He must have
kept that same rigid and sorrowful position
since the men left. Some green branches
placed upon the coffin have fallen to the floor
because of the dog's first frantic tugging at the
blanket. The shepherd must have led a lonely
life indeed to have no one but his faithful dog
to watch beside him. His hat and cane lie
where he left them, and all is very quiet.

In another picture Landseer painted a dog
lying on the ground over the grave where his
master lies buried. We can easily imagine
that this dog will follow his master to his last
resting place and that he, too, will act as sentinel
over the grave of the one he loves so dearly.
Landseer wanted to make us feel how good and
faithful a friend a dog is.


Questions to help the pupil understand
the picture. Whose home was this? In what
country did he live? Tell about his life among[Pg 17]
the hills. Who helped him care for the sheep?
Why must they be cared for? Where did they
stay at night? What could the old man do in
the evening? When he became feeble, who did
nearly all the work of caring for the sheep?
When the master did not wake up what did
the dog probably do? Why have the branches
fallen from the coffin? Why do you suppose
there is no one else in the room?


The story of the artist. Sir Edwin Landseer's
grandfather was a jeweler and his father
also learned that trade. The jewelers of that
day were very often asked to engrave the copper
plates that were used in printing pictures.
Sir Edwin's father soon decided that he would
rather engrave pictures than sell jewels, and he
became a very skillful engraver.

At that time few people realized what an art
it was to be able to cut a picture in copper so
that a great many copies of it could be made
from one plate. They did not even consider it
an art as we do, and so engravers were not allowed
to exhibit at the Royal Academy and were given
no honors at all. Edwin's father thought this
was not right, and gave several lectures in
defense of the art. He said that engraving is
a kind of "sculpture performed by incision."
His talks were of no avail at the time, but
within a year after his death the engravers
received the recognition due them.

[Pg 18]His eldest son, Thomas, also became famous
as an engraver, and to him we are indebted for
so many fine prints of Sir Edwin Landseer's
paintings. Thomas also made an engraving
of the "Horse Fair" for Rosa Bonheur. Few
can afford to own the paintings, but the prints
come within the means of all of us.

Edwin's father taught him to draw, and
even when Edwin was only five years old he
could draw remarkably well. Edwin had three
sisters and two brothers. They lived in the
country, and often the father went with his
children for a walk through the fields. There
were two very large fields separated by a
fence over which was built an old-fashioned
stile with several steps. The fence was built
high so the sheep and cows in the fields could not
jump over. One day Edwin stopped at the
stile to look at the cows and asked his father to
show him how to draw them. His father then
gave Edwin his first lesson in drawing a cow.
After this Edwin came nearly every day to
these fields and his father called them "Edwin's
studio."

When he was only thirteen years old, two
of his pictures were exhibited at the Royal
Academy. One was a portrait of a mule, and
the other was of a dog and puppies. Edwin
painted from real life always, not caring to[Pg 19]
make copies from the work of others. All the
sketches he made when he was a little boy
were kept carefully by his father, and now if
you go to England you may see them in the
South Kensington Museum in London.

Landseer was only sixteen years old when
he exhibited his wonderful picture "Fighting
Dogs Getting Wind." A very rich man whose
praise meant a great deal bought the picture,
and the young artist's success was assured.

It was about this time, too, that he painted
an old white horse in the stable of another
wealthy man. After the picture was finished
and ready to deliver, it suddenly disappeared.
A diligent search was made for it, but it was
not found until twenty-four years afterwards.
A servant had stolen it and hidden it in a
hayloft. He had been afraid to sell it or even
to keep it in his home, for no one would have
failed to recognize the great artist's work.

For many years Landseer lived and painted
in his father's house in a poor little room without
even a carpet. The only furniture, we are
told, were three cheap chairs and an easel.
Later he had a fine studio not far from Regent's
Park. Here was a small house with a garden
and a barn. The barn was made over into a
studio. Here so many people brought their
pets for him to paint that he had to keep a[Pg 20]
list, and each was obliged to wait his turn.
But Sir Edwin was not a very good business
man, so he left all his affairs to his father, who
sold his pictures for him and kept his accounts.

Landseer made a special study of lions, too.
A lion died at the park menagerie and he
dissected its body and studied and drew every
part. He painted many pictures of lions. He
also modeled the great lions at the base of the
Nelson Monument in Trafalgar Square, London.

Although Landseer painted so many wild
animals, birds, and hunting scenes, he did not
care to shoot animals. His weapons were his
pencil and sketch book. Sometimes he hired
guides to take him into the wildest parts of
the country in search of game. But he quite
disgusted the guides when, a great deer bounding
toward him, he would merely make a sketch
of it in his book.

Many of Landseer's paintings are of scenes
in Scotland, as is this one, "Highland Shepherd's
Chief Mourner." When Sir Edwin Landseer
went to visit Scotland one of his fellow travelers
was Sir Walter Scott, the great novelist. The
two became close friends. Sir Walter Scott tells
us: "Landseer's dogs were the most magnificent
things I ever saw, leaping and bounding and
grinning all over the canvas." Landseer painted
Sir Walter Scott's dog "Maida Vale" many[Pg 21]
times, and he named his studio for the dog.

At twenty-four Landseer became an associate
of the Royal Academy, which was an
unusual honor for so young a man.

In 1850 the honor of knighthood was conferred
upon him.

This story is told of him at a social gathering
in the home of a well-known leader of society
in London. The company had been talking
about skill with the hands, when some one
remarked that no one had ever been found
who could draw two things at once. "Oh, I
can do that," said Landseer; "lend me two
pencils and I will show you." Quickly he drew
the head of a horse with one hand while with
the other he drew a stag's head and antlers.
Both sketches were so good that they might
well have been drawn with the same hand
and with much more study.

Sir Edwin Landseer felt that animals understand,
feel, and reason just like people, so he
painted them as happy, sad, gay, dignified,
frivolous, rich, poor, and in all ways just like
human beings. This appealed to the people,
and he became very popular.

Sir Edwin did and said all he could against
the custom of "cropping" the ears of dogs.
He said that nature intended to protect the
ears of dogs that "dig in the dirt," and man[Pg 22]
should not interfere. People paid attention to
what he said, and the custom lost favor.

Landseer died in London in 1873 at the age
of seventy-one. A tablet placed to his memory
in the notch of one of the windows at Westminster
Abbey has a medallion portrait of him
at the top, and below this, carved in light relief,
is a copy of one of his most famous paintings,
"The Highland Shepherd's Chief Mourner."

Original Picture: Prado Gallery, Madrid, Spain.
Artist: Bartolom         Esteban Murillo (mo      o r      l              y      ).
Birthplace: Seville, Spain.
Dates: Born, 1618; died, 1682.



The story of the picture. The great religious
painter, Murillo, has given us many pictures
of the Christ child and John the Baptist, but
perhaps none more pleasing than this one which
critics have so often declared the most beautiful
picture of children ever painted.

We must go back in our Bible history to
the time when the wicked King Herod reigned
over Judea, for it was then that our story
begins. This proud king had conquered all his
enemies and expected to live at ease in his rich
and beautiful palace, surrounded by all that
would give him comfort and pleasure. But
one day he was made very unhappy when a
messenger appeared bringing him most unwelcome
news. It was that a child had been born
in Bethlehem at just the time and place it had
been prophesied that a child should be born
who would one day be king over all the world.
In a manger of a stable, true to the prophecy,
the baby Jesus was born. The three wise
men of the East and many others who already
worshiped him as king sought and found him
there. The thought that the child would grow
up to rule over his kingdom alarmed King[Pg 25]
Herod, and he resolved to remove this possible
rival before it was too late. Fearful lest the
child should escape, Herod sent out a terrible
decree that all boy babies under two years of
age should be killed. That must have been a
dreadful day, for there was little hope of escape
or concealment.

However, Mary and Joseph had been warned
by an angel several days before, and with the
child Jesus they were already safe on their way
to Egypt. They had left in the night, and no
one could tell anything about them, or where
to look for them. Several years later King
Herod died, and almost immediately Mary,
Joseph, and the boy Jesus started on the homeward
journey. It was during this journey, we
are told, that the boy, running on ahead of the
donkey Mary was riding, found a cool little
spring where he could quench his thirst. Suddenly
there appeared another boy wearing a
camel's-hair cloak and carrying a wooden stick
with a cross carved upon it. He was followed
by a lamb. It was John the Baptist, who,
although only a child, was living among the
hills, eating locusts and wild honey, preparing
for the great work he was to do. It is supposed
that as the mothers of these two boys often
visited each other, the children must have met
before. In the picture we see them standing[Pg 26]
near the cool little spring. Jesus has in his
hand a shell which, straightway forgetting his
own thirst, he has filled and now offers to his
cousin John.

John the Baptist is bending over to drink
from the shell which Jesus holds for him. The
lamb watches them contentedly, while from
the sky above the angels, with clasped hands
and smiling faces, look down in silent adoration.
Although he does not look at them, Jesus seems
conscious of their presence, for he points toward
them with his little hand. Light radiates from
the clouds and the angels, while deep shadows
at the left and the right serve to heighten the
effectiveness of the central part of the picture.
The lamb, as the symbol of innocence, is the
natural playmate of these two healthy, sturdy
boys. The little John drinks eagerly, as if
he were indeed thirsty and weary, while Jesus,
although younger in years, has the kind and
thoughtful look of an elder brother caring for
a younger.

At this moment they seem to be merely
two thirsty boys, little knowing the great work
before them or thinking of anything but to
quench their thirst. Yet some of the coming
greatness shows itself in the generous action
of the child Jesus and the gentle acceptance
of John the Baptist.


[Pg 27]Questions to help the pupil understand the
picture. Whom does this picture represent?
For what kind of paintings is Murillo famous?
what subjects? Tell about King Herod. Why
was he worried when he heard of the birth of
Jesus? What did he do in order to be sure the
child would be killed? What did the parents
of the baby Jesus do? When was it safe for
the boy Jesus to return? How did he happen
to meet John at the spring? How was John
dressed? What followed him? For what does
the lamb stand? Who has the shell? What
does he do with it? Why do you suppose he
did not drink first? To whom does Jesus point
or beckon with his left hand? Which boy was
the younger? For what is this picture famous?


The story of the artist. A little Spanish
boy, Bartolom         Esteban Murillo, born into the
home of a poor mechanic, and with no opportunities
save those of his own making, grew
to be one of the greatest of Spanish painters.
Both his parents died before he was eleven
years old, and he seems to have been left quite
to his own devices. Until that time he had
attended school, where his ability to draw had
shown itself in pictures drawn on the walls of
the school building.

After school and on Saturdays he had
assisted an artist, doing such work as cleaning
brushes, grinding paints, and running errands.
An uncle had secured this position for him, but[Pg 28]
seemed to be unable to help him further. By
these means and by painting banners and pictures
for the weekly market, the boy earned
his own living. The peasants came to Seville
from all the country around, bringing in their
fruits, vegetables, and wares to sell. Here the
young Murillo took his paintings, which were
on coarse, cheap cloth instead of on canvas,
which he could not afford. Sometimes it was
a Madonna, sometimes a portrait of the buyer
which he would finish quickly while the crowd
watched, or sometimes one of the beggar boys
in the gypsy quarters of the city.

But Murillo had a boy friend who went
to London to study with the great Sir Anthony
Van Dyck, and who, when he returned, brought
such news of the wonderful paintings in the
galleries of London and Paris that Murillo began
to dream of seeing them. Before he had
saved enough money to go, however, the artist
Van Dyck died, and Murillo decided to go to
Madrid, where one of his own countrymen,
Vel        squez, had won great fame. He walked
nearly all the way, presenting his letter of
introduction to Vel        squez, who received him
most kindly.

Murillo was now twenty-four years old,
enthusiastic, ambitious, and manly. Vel        squez
soon discovered his great talent, and not only[Pg 29]
received him as a pupil but took him into his
own home, where he remained three years.
When, at the end of that time, he returned to
Seville, his fame as an artist was established
and pupils came to him from all over the
country. His friends could be found among
the very poorest beggars as well as among the
most influential men of the city, and he was
idolized by his pupils. Always of a deeply
religious nature, he chose religious subjects for
most of his paintings. In his studio all swearing
and ill conduct were forbidden, and his
religious paintings were produced only after
much prayerful meditation.

He gave so generously to the poor about
him that it was said he gave away all he earned.

Often his wife, who was very beautiful, his
lovely daughter, or his two handsome sons posed
for his paintings, and so we find the same faces
repeated in several pictures.

One day when Murillo was painting on the
walls of a convent the cook there asked him to
paint a small picture for him on a napkin,
which was all he had to offer for a canvas.
Without hesitation Murillo painted a beautiful
Madonna and Child which has since become
famous as the "Virgin of the Napkin."

While painting the ceiling in a church in
Cadiz the scaffolding broke and he fell, injuring[Pg 30]
himself so seriously that he died shortly after.

Every Sunday afternoon, which is a free day
at the gallery in Madrid, crowds of the poor,
men, women, and children, may be seen gathered
around the paintings by Murillo, which they
regard with an admiration which is almost
worship. To them Murillo is little less than
a saint.

SAVED

Questions to arouse interest. What has
happened? Where are the dog and the child?
Why do you think it could not have been a
shipwreck? Why are the sea gulls flying
around? What can you see in the distance?
What kind of a beach is it?


Artist: Sir Edwin Landseer (l      nd              s      r).
Birthplace: London, England.
Dates: Born, 1802; died, 1873.



The story of the picture. This fine Newfoundland
dog has just saved the life of a little
child. We can see even in this print of the
picture that they are both dripping wet, and[Pg 32]
so we know the child must have fallen into
the water and was about to drown when the
dog swam out and brought her safely to the
shore.

We can only guess how the accident occurred.
It could not have been a shipwreck, for then
there would be others for the good old dog to
save; besides, although the sky is partly cloudy,
there is no evidence of a storm, and we see sailboats
in the distance.

The child evidently had not been wading
out into the water and gone beyond her depth,
because she has on her shoes and stockings and
is dressed for a day in the warm sunshine,
perhaps out on the beach. Probably she had
been playing on the wharf or on the rocky shore
and had reached out too far or had slipped on a
rock.

The dog, hearing her cry, must have immediately
plunged into the water after her.
Then holding the child firmly by her dress, he
had battled against the waves until he reached
a sandy beach from which he had dragged himself
to this place.

Although we cannot see the parents, nurse,
or playmates, no doubt they are running toward
the child and the dog. The dog seems to
be watching their approach as he lies there
exhausted, guarding the precious burden lying[Pg 33]
across his paws. His great tongue hangs out
and we can almost hear him pant as he gasps
for breath after his fierce struggle against the
waves.

The child is still unconscious, her large shade
hat held by a rubber band under her chin; her
arm lies limp and lifeless, yet we are sure the
great dog has been in time, and she will soon
open her eyes. The sea gulls circle about the
two as if they were glad of the rescue, and
were trying to show the parents where to find
the child.

These powerful Newfoundland dogs are
strong swimmers. At the first cry of alarm they
usually plunge unbidden into the water, and
rarely fail to accomplish a rescue. In France
they are kept on the banks of the Seine as
important members of the life-saving crew.
Here they are carefully trained for this purpose
by their masters, who throw a stuffed figure of
a man into the water and teach the dogs to
bring it back to shore. They are taught always
to hold the head of the figure above the water.
They seem to understand perfectly just what
is wanted of them and why.

A story is told, and it is claimed to be true,
of a woman who, while washing clothes on the
bank of a river, placed her baby in the clothes
basket to keep it safe. In some way the child[Pg 34]
tipped the basket, rolling out of it and down
the bank into the deep water below. The
woman screamed but she was helpless. Hearing
her cry, a large Newfoundland dog that
she had never seen before came swimming down
the stream and saved the child, carrying it to
the opposite shore.

The woman ran down the bank of the river
and secured the help of a ferryman and his
grandson, a boy about ten years old. When
the boat reached the opposite shore the big dog
was licking the hands and face of the cooing
child, but growled and barked viciously at the
people who were approaching him. No one
dared go near him. They tried every device,
but no, he could not be coaxed away from the
baby.

At last the boy said he had an idea, and off
he ran down the bank and jumped into the
boat. Rowing out some distance into the river,
he suddenly jumped from the boat into the
water, uttering a loud cry of distress. He
struggled a while, and then to all appearances
sank out of sight. The grandfather knew the
boy could swim and dive, and yet the suddenness
with which he sank alarmed him greatly,
and he called out, too.

Immediately the great dog recognized the
cry of alarm and, forgetting all else, left his[Pg 35]
small charge and rushed to the help of the
larger one, bringing the boy safely to the shore.
Meanwhile, of course, the mother had taken up
the baby. The dog, though showing surprise at
the quick recovery of the boy he supposed to be
nearly drowned, still determined to guard him
in the same way he had guarded the baby.

About this time, however, the dog's owner,
a huntsman, appeared. The dog greeted him
joyously, running from the child to the boy and
then to his master as if to tell him what he had
done and how he had guarded them until his
master came.

Many times it has been told of a Newfoundland
that, when annoyed by some small dog
that persisted in barking and snapping at him,
he would finally seize it by the back of the
neck, carry it to the river, and drop it into the
water. After watching the struggles of the
little dog, which seldom was able to swim, the
Newfoundland would plunge in and rescue him.
After that you may be sure the little dog took
care not to annoy the big one.

A humorous incident is told of two boatmen
who, on a wager, started to swim across a
stream. When one of the men was in midstream
his Newfoundland dog plunged in after
him and in spite of his struggles brought him
back to the shore by his hair. The crowd[Pg 36]
which had been watching was greatly amused,
but the chagrined sailor was able to laugh in
turn when the great animal, mistaking the
emotion of the onlookers, brought the other
man back also.

A lady who owned a fine Newfoundland dog
allowed him one day to carry her parasol.
When they came to a baker's shop she bought
a bun for him. The next day the dog met
another lady coming down the street carrying
a parasol. He immediately seized it and
ran on ahead until he came to the baker's
shop. The lady went in and asked the baker
to help her secure her parasol. He suggested
that she give the dog a bun as his mistress
had done. Then the dog gave up the parasol
willingly. He had to be punished very severely
before he could be broken of this habit.

Cases have been known of these dogs
rescuing even so delicate a thing as a canary
bird that had fallen into the water.

Intelligent and faithful, perhaps there is no
other dog, unless it be the St. Bernard, which
rescues travelers in the snow-covered Alps, that
has done so much for man or has saved so
many lives.

These dogs show remarkable kindness not
only toward man but toward other animals.
When another dog has been injured they[Pg 37]
have been known to carry bones and other
food to it.

A Newfoundland was once taken to a dog
pound with numerous other dogs. He soon
gnawed his rope in two and was about to escape
when, hearing the piteous cries of the other
dogs, he went from one to another, setting
them all free.

Even abuse will not make these loyal
animals turn against a master, although they
have been known to run away from a cruel
one. A story is told of a man who, while
rowing a boat, pushed his Newfoundland dog
into the stream. The dog followed the boat for
some time but, growing tired at last, tried to
get back into the boat. The man pushed him
away several times, finally pushing so hard that
he overturned the boat and was about to
drown. The good dog, however, caught hold
of his coat and held him above water until
help came.

In the island of Newfoundland these dogs
are used much as we use horses, and are very
valuable. With them duty is first. We often
hear of one of these dogs carrying a basket of
meat, a paper, or some other thing for his owner,
and bearing any amount of annoyance from
other dogs until he has delivered his charge
safely; then he promptly goes back and punishes[Pg 38]
the offenders in such a way that they dare
not interfere with him again.

These dogs are noble animals indeed. Their
lives are devoted to man, though their devotion
is not always appreciated as it should be.

Lord Byron writes:


"In life the firmest friend,
The first to welcome, foremost to defend;
Whose honest heart is still his master's own;
Who labors, fights, lives, breathes for him alone.
The rich man's guardian, and the poor man's friend."


No wonder Sir Edwin Landseer loved to
paint these noble animals. Their intelligent
look and, better still, their brave and noble
deeds render them almost human, lacking only
the power of speech. It seems sometimes as
if they really do talk, and the owners of such
dogs declare that their actions prove that the
dogs understand every word said to them.

Sir Edwin Landseer has painted another picture
of a Newfoundland dog, called "A Member
of the Royal Humane Society," which looks
so much like this one that it might be the
same dog.

The story of the artist. When Edwin
Landseer was a small boy he lived in the country.
Nearly every day at breakfast the father would
ask his boys, "What shall we draw to-day?"
The three boys would take turns choosing and
sometimes they would vote on it. Then out
across the fields the father and his boys would
tramp until they came to where the donkeys,
sheep, goats, and cows were grazing. Each
would choose the animal he wished to draw;
then the four would sit down on the grass
and make their sketches. Edwin's first choice
for a subject was a cow, and his father helped
him draw it.

When he was five years old he drew a picture
of a dog asleep on the floor that was very much
better than any his older brothers could do,
and so even then they began to expect much
from him.

At this time Edwin had three dogs of his
own named Brutus, Vixen, and Boxer. They
were always with him, and so intelligent they
almost seemed to speak.

In their back yard the children had several[Pg 41]
pens for pet rabbits and they kept pigeons in
the attic of their house. The story is told of
how Mr. Landseer once decided to move,
selected the house, and thought all was settled,
when the landlord refused to rent the house
to him because he kept so many animals and
birds as pets.

We read of how the father and his sons
made many visits to the Zo      logical Gardens
where they could watch and make sketches of
lions, bears, and other wild animals. One day
they saw a strange sight in one of the store
windows in London       a large Newfoundland
dog caring for a lion. The lion had been caught
in Africa when it was very little and had been
cared for by this dog. They had never been
separated. Now, although the lion was much
larger than the dog, they were still the best of
friends.

Sometimes the dog would punish the lion if
it did not behave, and the great beast would
whimper just as if it could not help itself. All
three boys made many sketches of this strange
pair and could hardly be persuaded to leave the
window.

Every one knew of Sir Edwin Landseer and
wanted some one of his pictures of dogs because
it looked so much like a dog they knew.

In the story of the picture "Highland[Pg 42]
Shepherd's Chief Mourner," are further particulars
of the life of Sir Edwin Landseer.

Artist: George Henry Boughton (b                    t      n).
Birthplace: Norwich, England.
Dates: Born, 1833; died, 1905.



The story of the picture. We all know how,
long ago, that sturdy band of one hundred and[Pg 44]
two Puritans left England in the small and
storm-beaten ship called the Mayflower. They
were called Puritans because they were dissatisfied
with the religion of the Church of
England, and demanded purification of all the
old observances and doctrines.

When they began to establish in England
separate churches of their own, they were
driven from place to place. They longed for
a land where they could worship God in their
own way, so they came to America, determined
to endure every danger and to trust in God to
care for them. Their wanderings from place to
place had given them a new name, "Pilgrim,"
which means "wanderer." Then, ever since
their landing on the rock at Plymouth, they
have been called Pilgrim Fathers.

There were many women and children in
this band of wanderers. On the journey a
little baby was born and was called Oceanus
after the great rolling ocean.

The Pilgrims endured many hardships in
those first few years, and none more distressing
than the frequent attacks by the Indians, who
resented the strangers' presence in a land which
belonged to them. The Pilgrims carried their
guns with them even when they went to church,
for they never knew just when they might be
attacked.

[Pg 45]They arrived in the fall of the year, too
late to plant grain or to put by enough provisions
for the winter, so they were quite dependent
upon the provision boat from England. Often
this boat was long delayed because of storms at
sea, or because the people in England did not
send it on time. This caused much suffering
and distress.

In our picture we see three of the first
settlers of our New England coast, waiting for
the provision ship. The waves come rolling
in to this rough and barren shore, but as far
as the eye can see there is yet no sign of the
awaited boat. On that point of land in the
distance are a few rude houses which must be
the homes of the Pilgrims. This dreary place,
so bleak and barren, makes us wonder how
they could ever hope to survive the perils of
a winter there.

Our interest is centered upon the three
figures at the right in the picture. One can
almost read the thoughts expressed in the three
faces. The figure of the man stands out strong
and erect, and there is that in his fixed gaze
which tells us his thoughts are far away. No
doubt he is thinking of his old home across
the ocean. He is homesick, yet go back he
would not; there is no sign of discouragement.
His wife, standing beside him, places her hand[Pg 46]
on his shoulder to comfort him, but she too
looks as if she were thinking of that other home
and the friends across the sea. Her gentle,
refined face is saddened for the moment, yet
in it we see expressed the fine courage which
has carried her thus far along the way.

The mother, seated on the great rock, has
the same thoughtful, far-away gaze. Her hands,
clasped in her lap, have more of resignation
and patience in them. Probably her thoughts
and affections are centered in the two dear ones
beside her, and in their welfare, rather than
in the friends across the sea.

Notice the Puritan dress, cloaks, shoes, caps,
and collars. These people are well dressed,
and do not seem to be poor. Perhaps they are
simply longing to hear from their friends, and
hoping the ship will bring some news of them.
It may be that it has been due for several days,
and each day they have walked out to this
same rocky point, hoping to see it on the
distant horizon.

They are dressed in warm clothes. From
that fact and from the half-bare branches of
the bush that we see growing beside the rock
in the foreground of the picture we should
judge it to be the fall of the year.

Standing in the bright sunlight, they look
anxiously out toward the rolling ocean. The[Pg 47]
length of the shadows makes us think it must
be late in the afternoon.

When at last they catch a glimpse of the
dark masts of the approaching ship they will
send a glad shout along the shore, and soon the
beach will be crowded with an anxious throng
of people hoping for some message or news
from home.

At what seems to be a long distance from
the shore the great ship will cast anchor and
send out its rowboats filled with passengers,
mail, and provisions. How eagerly the homesick
people will crowd around the new arrivals and
welcome them! Our three friends will not
be standing quiet and alone, but each will be
hurrying about to help the others. The spirit
of helpfulness was very strong in those days of
hardship and toil.

Notice the arrangement of lights and
shadows in this picture. Our eye is first
attracted to the faces of these three Pilgrims,
then carried almost in a circle to the ocean,
the rocks at the left side of the picture, to the
rock the mother is seated upon, and back to
the three faces. Start where we please the
play of light leads us back to the three faces
brought out by the white collars. Suppose
we start with the mother's hands, our eyes
follow her apron, the man's shoes, the light on[Pg 48]
the grass and ocean, then to the man's face
and on around. Without these echoes of light,
the picture would be unbalanced and much less
interesting.

Half close your eyes and study the picture.
There is not a single straight line in the
composition. Notice the placing of the horizon
line, of the distant shore. The artist started
his landscape much as we do, with a rectangular
space divided into two parts by the horizon line.
He chose for his picture a small division for
sky; the larger space to be divided into less
than half as much water as land. Instead of
standing so the shore line would appear exactly
horizontal, he chose a position where the
near shore line and that of the distant point
of land are at an angle, thus relieving the
monotony.

The tall, determined figure of the man, and
his gentle wife, standing silhouetted against
the sky, hold the ground space and the sky
space together, while the mother seated on the
rock serves as another connecting link. All
the figures serve to unite the different parts
of the picture into an effect of unity most
gratifying to the eye.


Questions to help the pupil understand the
picture. Tell about the Puritans. Why were
they so called? Why did they leave England?[Pg 49]
In what boat did they sail? To what country
did they come? Why were they then called
Pilgrims? Why did they have such a hard time
in this country? Upon what were they dependent?
Why was the boat often delayed? What
are the three people in our picture waiting for?
What do the expressions in their faces tell us?
How can we tell what time of year it is? the
time of day? What will they do when they
see the boat? Who will join them? Where
will they come from? What can you see of
their homes? Why are they so anxious to have
the boat come? Why cannot the ship land
at this beach? How will it land its passengers
and freight? What do you suppose these
three people will be doing then? What can you
say of the composition of this picture? What
did the artist consider first? What holds the
ground and the sky spaces together? What
can you say of the light and shade in this picture?
Why is the picture called "Pilgrim Exiles"?


The story of the artist. George Henry
Boughton was born near Norwich, England, but
when he was only a year old his parents
came to America. He grew up and was educated
at Albany, New York, where he first
began to paint.

As soon as he started to school he showed
great skill at drawing, by, as he says, "drawing
every mortal thing that came under my notice."

When he was nineteen years old he sold[Pg 50]
enough of his sketches to pay his way back to
London, England. He spent several months in
England, sketching wherever he went. When
he came back to New York he painted a
picture called "Winter Twilight," which marked
the beginning of his success. Later he spent
a year in Paris, finally making his permanent
home in London.

His studio in New York City was given
up, but, although he lived in England, his art
remained distinctly American.

He was especially interested in the history
and literature of our country and has been
called "the interpreter and illuminator of New
England life in the seventeenth century."

Besides painting, he wrote for magazines,
illustrating his own stories with great success.


Questions about the artist. Tell about the
artist. Where was he born? Where did he
grow up? How old was he when he came to
America? In what did he excel at school?
When did he go back to England? How did
he earn the money? What did he do when
he came back? Of what country did he paint
the most pictures? What part of our history
interested him especially? In what else was
he successful besides painting?

DANCE OF THE NYMPHS

Questions to arouse interest. Of what is
this a picture? What time of the year do
you think it is? what time of the day? What
are the people doing? Half close your eyes
and look at the picture. What do you see
first? what next? Where is the sun? How
do you know? (Look at the trunks of the
trees and the shadows.) What do you see in
the foreground to the left? to the right? Do
you like this scene? why?


Original Picture: Luxembourg Gallery, Paris, France.
Artist: Jean Baptiste Camille Corot (k[+o]       r[+o]              ).
Birthplace: Paris, France.
Dates: Born, 1796; died, 1875.



[Pg 52]The story of the picture. The artist who
painted this picture, Jean Baptiste Corot, tells
us that when he was a small boy he used to
lean out of his window at night, long after his
mother and father thought him safe in bed, to
watch the clouds, the sky, and the trees. He
continued this study as a young man, and soon
made friends with three other young men, all
artists (Rousseau, Daubigny, and Dupr        ) who
were also studying nature. All had studios
and painted in the city; but they were always
longing for a glimpse of the country. One day
the four started out together for a day's outing,
each taking his painter's outfit. They went to
the end of the omnibus line from Paris and
then started on foot for a long tramp across
the country. It was then they thought of
the great Forest of Fontainebleau, where nature
was wild and undisturbed in its wondrous
beauty.

"We will go to that beautiful forest and
spend our vacation there," they said.

And so it came about several weeks later.
In this forest, at all times of the day or night,
they could be found wandering about, searching
out new vistas and discovering new wonders
and beauties in nature.

They hid their paints and brushes in the
rocks to keep them from the dew, and they[Pg 53]
themselves slept under the spreading branches
of the great oak trees. These city-bred young
men, brought up in the rush and hurry of the
great city of Paris, cared for no other shelter
than the wide expanse of sky and the protecting
branches of the trees.

So when we know that later Corot came to
live near this Forest of Fontainebleau, it is
easy to guess where he painted this picture
called the "Dance of the Nymphs." Sometimes
this picture is called "Morning," for
Corot painted another picture much like this
one, and called it, "The Dance of the Nymphs,
Evening."

Corot is often spoken of as the "happy
one," and many stories are told of him and how
surprising it was to hear him singing lustily as
he painted. Seated on his camp stool before
his easel, wearing his blue calico blouse and
painter's hat, he was indeed happy. He is
described as adding the finishing touches to
one of his landscapes in this way:

"Let us put that there       tra, la, tra, la,       a
little boy,       ding dong, ding dong! Oh, a
little boy, he wants a cap       la, la, la, la, tra la!"

People always smiled when they saw Corot
start out, carrying his easel, paints, and brushes,
and singing or whistling like a care-free boy.
But it happened more often that they saw him[Pg 54]
going toward home in the evening, for he had a
way of starting out before sunrise when nobody
was about and seating himself in some lovely
spot in the woods, waiting breathlessly to see
what would happen next.

That is what he did the morning he sketched
this picture. The grass was heavy with dew,
the birds were still asleep, all was quiet and
covered with the veil of night. As the mist
slowly lifted, the great trees gradually assumed
definite shapes, the birds awoke, the sun shone
forth, and all was bright and fresh as the early
mornings in spring always are. Look at this
picture, then close your eyes and open them
slowly, and you yourself can see just such an
awakening to life.

Is it any wonder then that, as Corot sat,
pencil in hand, this lovely spring morning and
watched the trees gradually take shape against
the slowly lightening sky, and listened to
the birds singing their morning greeting, he
should fancy he saw the fairy wood nymphs
come out from their secret hiding places and
dance joyously about in the bright morning
sunlight? It seems most natural indeed that
they should be there, and dancing, too. The
mere fact of being alive on such a morning as
this fills us too with delight.

When Corot began to paint his large picture[Pg 55]
from the small sketch he made in the woods
that morning, he must have sung his merriest
tunes. The picture seems full of music, from
the quivering leaves, the waving grass, and the
shifting clouds to the dancing figures. Although
there is not a bird in sight, we know that they
are there, and it takes very little imagination
to hear them singing.

At the right-hand side of the picture one of
the wood nymphs has seized the hand of a
timid companion, urging her to come and join
in the frolic. So much are we in sympathy
with those merry ones that we too find ourselves
unconsciously urging her to join in the dance.

When he painted trees, Corot did not pay
very great attention to details, and so we
cannot always tell what kind of trees they were.
He cared most to make us feel the beauty
of the sunlight on their tender leaves, their
growth, and the protection they offer to birds
and men.

A young art student once approached Corot
and asked him why he left so many things
out of his pictures and put others in. Then
pointing to a certain tree in Corot's painting he
said, "This tree is not in the landscape."
Corot smiled, then whispered to him, "Don't
you tell, but I put it there to please the birds."

It would be difficult indeed to find a single[Pg 56]
straight line in our picture, so full is it of
rhythmic curves, from the treetops to the
graceful figures in the foreground. The skillful
blending of colors, of light and shade, gives it
that mysterious, misty quality which is one of
its chief charms. Corot's favorite colors were
pale green, gray browns, and silvery grays.
One little touch of bright color in his pictures
makes them alive. The costumes of the
nymphs were chosen for the very few bright
touches in this painting, and the tall, slender
tree near the left-hand side of the picture for
the pale green feathery foliage of early spring.

Our eye moves pleasantly through all the
leafy maze of this enchanted forest. We are
at the edge of the woods. Looking out through
the trees we see the wide, open fields beyond,
with their high canopy of sky, and we feel a
new contentment steal over us as our eye again
seeks this sheltered nook in the great Forest
of Fontainebleau.


Questions to help the pupil understand the
picture. How had the artist, Corot, studied
the clouds, sky, and trees? With whom did he
become friends? What were these three young
artists doing? Where did they go for an
outing? What did they take with them? What
forest did they decide would be a good place to
spend a vacation? How did they live in this
forest? What shelter did they have? What[Pg 57]
nickname did they give Corot? How did he
like to paint? How did he dress? What did
he do while painting? Where was this picture
painted? What is it sometimes called? What
time of day did he usually start out to paint?
What are the nymphs doing? What did Corot
wish to tell us about the trees? What did a
young art student once ask Corot? What was
the answer? Of what kind of lines is this
picture made up? What colors were used?
Where are the bright colors? In what part of
the forest is this picture? What can you see
through the open space?


The story of the artist. From the very
first all things seemed to favor Corot. Of a
naturally happy disposition, born into a family
of means, and all his life free from financial
worries, everything seemed to combine to make
his life one of care-free ease and pleasure.

His father and mother kept a millinery
store; this must have been a good business, for
they soon accumulated a comfortable fortune.

At ten years of age Corot was sent away to
school at Rouen in the hope of making a business
man of him. He lived with a friend of his
father who was a serious man but also a great
lover of nature. Corot took many a long walk
with him over narrow, unfrequented paths.
They took these walks usually at the close of
the day, and so Corot's love of the twilight
hour grew strong.

[Pg 58]Upon his return to Paris seven years later,
his father placed him in a drygoods store, where
he remained for nearly nine years. Whenever
there were no customers the boy would hide
under the counter and draw. His employer was
a good-natured man and he sympathized with
Corot in his desire to be a painter. So he told
the father it was of no use to try to make a business
man of him as his tastes were all for art.

About this time Corot went to his father
and asked his permission to study painting.
The father was not at all pleased with the idea,
but decided to let him try. He told his son he
had set aside a certain sum of money to start
him in business for himself and he could choose
that or a small income which would be allowed
him for the study of art. If he chose the latter,
however, he must not expect any other help
from his father, as he did not approve of this
new venture. But Corot embraced his father
most affectionately and declared he had made
him the happiest person in the world. He
then proceeded at once to the nearest store and
bought a complete painter's outfit. Choosing
a spot by the river near his father's house, he
began to paint. He tells us how the girls
who worked in the millinery store slipped away
and came to see what he was doing. He never
parted with this first painting, but kept it as a[Pg 59]
reminder of his great happiness when he was
at last free to do "what he most desired in
the world."

He studied under several artists, but received
little encouragement until he went to Rome to
study.

Most of the paintings of that time were
classical, including Greek temples, shepherds,
nymphs, or dryads, and such trees as cedars and
palms. That is why Millet's simple peasants and
Corot's misty landscapes were not appreciated.

At Rome, Corot became a great favorite
among the students because of his happy
nature and the rollicking, jolly songs he could
sing. But as for his pictures,       they were
considered very amusing.

However, one day as he sat sketching the
Coliseum a friend who was regarded as an
authority on landscape painting praised his
work. Corot looked around expecting to be
laughed at, but no,       the man was in earnest.
That evening, before all the other students, he
remarked that Corot might some day become
the master of them all. This gave him standing
among the artists and was greatly appreciated
by Corot, who always felt that this praise was
the beginning of his success. It was not long
after this that his pictures were exhibited and
many honors came to him.

[Pg 60]Does it seem strange that Corot and Millet,
looking upon the same woods and people,
living and painting so near each other, should
choose such different subjects? Corot saw the
same poor, toilworn peasants, and he helped
them most generously when they asked him,
but as for painting them       he did not think
of it. Millet saw the same beautiful woods,
fields, and sky, and loved them all, but to him
the peasant came first.

He said, "Corot's pictures are beautiful,
but they do not reveal anything new."

Corot said, "Millet's painting is for a new
world; I do not feel at home there. I am too
much attracted to the old. I see therein great
knowledge, air, and depth, but it frightens me;
I love better my little music."

In speaking of another artist he said, "He
is an eagle; I am only a skylark. I send forth
little songs in my gray clouds."

As success came to Corot he was most
generous in helping others. Many young
artists came to study with him, but he would
accept no pay for his instruction and gladly
did all he could to encourage and help them.

He did not have the heart to turn a beggar
from his door, and often had as many as twenty-five
come to him in a day. The story is told
of a beggar who demanded a larger sum of[Pg 61]
money than Corot usually gave, and was
refused. After he left, the artist could not
paint; his day was spoiled. So he hurriedly
ran out after the beggar, gave him the money,
and all was well again.

During the siege of Paris he gave both time
and money to help the wounded. "Papa Corot,"
as the people called him, was greatly beloved.

The demand for his paintings increased.
He said that when youth left him, honor and
fame came to make him still the happiest man
in the world.


Questions about the artist. In what ways
was Corot favored? What did his father and
mother do? What did they hope to make of
Corot? Where was he sent? With whom did
he live? Where did they walk? How did this
influence Corot? Upon his return home, what
did he do? What did his employer finally do?
What did Corot ask his father? What offer
did his father make? What did Corot decide?
What did he do at once? Who came to watch
him? What became of this first painting? Where
did Corot go to study? What subjects did most
of the artists of Corot's time choose to paint?
What happened that raised Corot in their
estimation? Compare the subjects chosen by
Corot and Millet. Tell about Corot and the
beggar. Why did Corot claim to be the happiest
man in the world? Does this picture make you
feel happy or sad? why?

    OXEN PLOWING


[Pg 63]
OXEN PLOWING

Questions to arouse interest. How many
of you have ever watched oxen plowing? How
are these oxen geared together? How many
oxen usually draw one plow? Why do you
think they use so many in the field? With
what part of the body do the oxen pull the
plow? Why is the earth plowed? How can
you tell that the soil these men are plowing
is moist and fertile? In what direction is
the sun? (Look at the shadows.) How is the
driver urging the oxen on? Where is the
farm house? What do you consider most
interesting about the oxen?


Original Picture: Luxembourg Gallery, Paris, France.
Artist: Rosa Bonheur (b[+o]       n      r              ).
Birthplace: Bordeaux, France.
Dates: Born, 1822; died, 1899.



The story of the picture. It must have been
very early in the morning indeed when these
men and their oxen started to plow this great
field, for although the sun is still low in the sky,
each group of oxen has already plowed two
furrows. By those long shadows and the light
in the sky we know the sun cannot be very
high in the heavens, and there is that about[Pg 64]
the ground, the occupation, and the distant
trees that suggests the season, spring.

We are told that Rosa Bonheur went out
into the country to paint this picture, and that
she had a small shed made into a studio where
she could keep her canvas and paints. Every
evening when she came home her father would
ask anxiously about the picture, for he was not
well enough to go to see it and he knew Rosa
was working very hard on it.

Even her genius could not make it possible
for her to paint such a picture as this without
much preparation. In fact, she had been preparing
for it for years,       as far back as when
she made her first drawing of oxen, and then
later when she went to the packing houses and
made separate studies of each part of an ox.
She knew just how those great muscles did
their work, and just how the curving ribs and
the joints did their part. In this picture she
shows us just enough of their movements to
make us feel the great strength and power of
those patient animals.

Our wonder grows anew that even one such
powerful ox can be controlled by man's will.
It is plain to see that the ox nearest us, of the
middle pair, does resent the prodding with
the stick which the driver uses so vigorously.
His great eye rolls and he looks indignant,[Pg 65]
but it is only for the moment       he accepts all
with resignation and indifference, knowing that
it will be the turn of one of the other oxen next.
These oxen are geared together by a central
pole which is fastened to their horns. This
causes them to take the entire weight of the
plow with their horns instead of with their
shoulders as our horses do. It would seem to
be a most uncomfortable arrangement, yet they
are used to it.

The leaders must be chosen very carefully
if the farmer would have a straight furrow.
It seems as if these first two oxen in the picture
feel the responsibility, and are glad and willing
to do their part. There is a look of intelligence
about them that makes us certain that they
know and understand the worth of the thing
they are doing.

Oxen in our country are driven by the words
"gee," meaning turn to the right, and "haw,"
turn to the left. However, the drivers in this
picture would not use these words, for they are
Frenchmen, and would speak to them in their
own language.

It is easy to tell that the ground is soft by
the way the feet of the oxen sink down into it,
and by the man's wooden shoe which has half
slipped off his foot as he starts to lift it from the
ground. On this quiet, peaceful morning we[Pg 66]
can almost hear the heavy tread of the oxen as
they pass us, and the harsh call of the drivers
as they urge them on. In imagination we can
smell the freshly plowed earth. To be sure, it
is a hard pull up the hill, but how cheerfully,
even proudly, the oxen pull their load! Look
at their backs; you will see a slanting line which
emphasizes the fact that they are climbing a
hill. This line is broken somewhat by the slant
of the woods in the distance. Cover up these
distant woods with the hand or a piece of paper
and we immediately have the uncomfortable
feeling that the oxen are going to slip back out
of the picture.

In this picture the artist has portrayed the
intelligent use man makes of the power and
strength of animals and of the soil. We see
so few oxen now that we wonder why they were
so much used in those days; but of course we
know it was because the farmers did not have
the machinery for tilling the ground, sowing,
and planting grain that we have. Horses were
used also, but oxen were cheaper, so all could
afford them. Then, too, oxen may have been
chosen because of their superior strength,
steadiness, and patience.

The artist has centered our attention on
the nearest of the two first pairs of oxen.
The other oxen and driver are of secondary[Pg 67]
importance and the landscape itself last of all.
The artist has accomplished this by color, light,
and shade, and by a more careful treatment of
the nearest oxen, showing plainly their intelligent
eyes, wrinkled hides, and even the play
of muscles as they step forward, pulling their
heavy load.

Rosa Bonheur finished this painting only a
short time before her father died. As soon as
he saw it he knew that his daughter had painted
a masterpiece, and almost his last words were
in praise of her work.


Questions to help the pupil understand the
picture. Why do you think these men and oxen
must have started to work very early? Why
do you think it is still early? What time of
year do you think it is? why? Where did
Rosa Bonheur paint this picture? Where did
she keep her canvas and paints? What preparation
did she make before painting the picture?
What is the driver doing? In what humor does
the nearest ox seem to be? How are the oxen
geared together? Why must they have good
leaders? How are oxen driven? Why do you
think these drivers would not use the same
words that we should? How can you tell that
the ground is soft? Do you think the oxen are
pulling hard? Why did they use oxen so much
in those days? What are used now? Upon
which of the oxen has the artist centered our
attention? What is next in importance? last of[Pg 68]
all? How has the artist done this? What did
Rosa Bonheur's father think of this picture?

Rosa Bonheur as a Little Girl.
Rosa Bonheur as an Artist.



The story of the artist. Marie Rosalie
Bonheur spent the first ten years of her life in
a little country town. It was almost as good
as living in the country, for Rosa and her two
brothers spent most of their time in the woods
or fields. At home they had lambs, rabbits,
and squirrels for pets.

The father was an artist, and since he could
not sell many pictures in such a little village
he decided to move to the great city of Paris.
The children liked the gay city with its many
surprises, but they missed the woods and their
pets. The first place in which they lived was
up several flights of stairs and across the street
from a butcher's shop. This shop had a queer
sign. It was a wild boar roughly carved out
of wood, but it looked so much like the little
pet pig Rosa had in the country that she used[Pg 69]
to stop and pet it every time she passed that way.

A man who lived in the same house with
the Bonheur family kept a small school for
boys. Rosa's two brothers went to this school,
and after a while the teacher said Rosa might
come too. She was the only girl in the school,
but she did not mind that at all. The boys
were glad to have her with them, for she knew
more games than they did and played just like
one of them.

Her father did not do so well with his
painting as he had hoped, so they moved into
a cheaper house. It was here that Rosa's
mother died. The father was obliged to send
his children where they could be well cared
for, so the baby daughter, Juliette, was sent
to her grandmother, the two boys to school,
and Rosa went to live with an aunt. This
aunt sent her to school. To reach the schoolhouse
Rosa had to walk some distance through
the woods. Sometimes she would stop and
smooth the dust in the road with her hand and
then draw pictures in it with a stick. Even
then she liked to draw pictures of animals
best of all. Often she had such a good time
drawing that she forgot to go to school, or was
very late, so she did not get along very well
and was delighted when her father came to
take her home. He had married again and[Pg 70]
wanted all his children with him. How happy
they were!

A great many stories have been told about
the pets they kept in their house. Rosa's
brother Isidore carried a little lamb on his
shoulders down six flights of stairs every
morning and evening, that it might nibble the
green grass and be out in the fresh air. It
became a great pet, and all the children drew its
picture in ever so many different positions.
Besides, they had a parrot, a monkey, two
dogs, and some rabbits and birds for pets.
Their father let them keep these pets in a
room fitted especially for them.

The father taught in a private school at
that time, and was away from home all day,
but when he came home at night Rosa would
show him what she had been doing while he
was gone. Once she had been painting cherries,
and her father came home while she was at
work on them. He praised her very much and
helped her finish painting them.

In the evening Rosa, her two brothers, and
her father used to put their easels in different
parts of the big room and draw and paint until
it was quite late. They would all much rather
do this than anything else in the world, and it
was the only time their father could help them.

The father belonged to a religious order[Pg 71]
called the "Saint Simonians." The members
wore queer gowns and bonnets with long tassels.
Such a bonnet with a big tassel Rosa wore on
the street, and sometimes boys shouted and
laughed at her, but she paid no attention to
that.

The father secured a teaching position in
another private school and earned enough money
to send his three children there and give them
all they needed at home.

Rosa did not behave very well in school.
Often she was punished, sometimes by being
given nothing to eat but bread and water.
Every one liked her, however, for she was
good-hearted, kind, and full of fun. But finally
she did something that could not be
overlooked. This is what she did. The lady
who kept the school was very fond of flowers,
and above all she loved the stately hollyhocks.
She had a beautiful bed of them in the front
yard of the school that was very much admired
by all who passed. One day Rosa had been
reading in the history about war, and she
thought it would be fine fun to arrange a battle
between the school girls. They used wooden
sticks for swords. Very soon the girls on
Rosa's side drove their enemies toward the
hollyhock bed, where they turned and fled.
Seeing the hollyhocks standing guard like[Pg 72]
soldiers, Rosa thought it would be fun to
charge upon them, which she did, cutting off
all their heads with her stick. Is it any wonder
she was sent home in disgrace?

Her father then sent her to a dressmaker to
see if she could learn that trade, but Rosa did
not like dressmaking and finally went home
without having learned very much. Then some
friends gave her some photographs to color.
This she liked to do, so her father decided that
the only thing to do was to let her paint.

Rosa was willing to walk miles in all kinds
of weather, to sit hours in all kinds of uncomfortable
positions, and to go without food in
order to draw a good picture of some animal.
Now she began her study of animals in earnest.
She went to all the country horse fairs, to
the slaughter houses, and wherever there was
an opportunity to study them.

Rosa never had very pretty clothes. She
tells us herself that one day a parrot called
after her "Ha, ha! That hat!" Now that she
was grown up she found she could not get about
very easily in her long skirts. There were so
many rough men in the packing houses and in
other places where she must go to study that
she obtained a permit to wear men's clothing.
Her hair was short, anyway, and with her blue
working blouse and dark trousers she looked[Pg 73]
just like a man. Then no one noticed her as
she went about, for they thought her one of the
workmen. People who knew her did not mind
her dress, and were ready to help her as much
as they could in her work. The first picture she
exhibited was of some little rabbits nibbling
carrots.

Her pictures became famous the world over.
From all over the country she received gifts
of fine horses and other animals to paint.
Buffalo Bill once sent her two fine horses from
Texas. She bought a farm, and had a very
large barn built where she could keep her
animals.

How proud her father was of her!

One day she was working hard in her studio
when a servant came to tell her that the Empress
Eug        nie had come to see her. It was a great
event when this royal lady came to the artist's
studio; and there was Rosa dressed in her old
blue blouse covered with paint! She did not
have time even to slip it off before the empress
came in, but they had a most delightful visit.
As the Empress Eug        nie bent over and kissed
Rosa Bonheur, she pinned the Cross of the
Legion of Honor on the artist's blue blouse.
Rosa did not notice it until after the Empress
was gone. How pleased she must have been, for
she was the first woman to receive that honor.


[Pg 74]Questions about the artist. What is the
artist's full name? Where did she live the
first ten years of her life? What did the father
do for a living? Why did they move to the
city? How did the children like this change?
In what kind of a house did they live? Tell
about Rosa and the wild boar; the school for
boys. Why did they move? What became of
the children after their mother died? Why
was Rosa often late to school? Who came
to take her home? Tell about the new home
and the pets; Isidore and the lamb. How did
they all spend their evenings? Tell about the
"Saint Simon" bonnet. How did Rosa behave
at the private school? Tell about Rosa and
the hollyhocks. How was she punished?
What trade did her father wish her to learn?
What was she willing to do in order to paint
pictures? Where did she go to study animals?
How did she dress? Why did she dress like a
man? What presents did she receive? Where
did she keep them? Tell about the visit of the
Empress Eug        nie. How did she honor Rosa
Bonheur?


[Pg 75]
THE SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS

Studying the picture. Several days before the lesson is to
be taken up, the picture to be studied should be placed where
every pupil can see it.

First of all, the children should find out for themselves
what is in the picture. The questions accompanying the
story of each picture are intended to help them to do this.

Language work. The pupils should be encouraged in class
to talk freely and naturally. In this way the lesson becomes
a language exercise in which the pupils will gain in freedom
of expression and in the ability to form clear mental images.

If a lesson does not occupy the entire drawing period, the
children should be asked to retell the story of the picture.

Dramatization and drawing. Most of the stories told by the
pictures lend themselves readily to dramatization and, whenever
practicable, such stories should be acted out. The stories
also offer numerous interesting situations that may be used
as subjects for drawing lessons.

The review lesson. The review lesson should cover all pictures
and artists studied throughout the year. At this time
other pictures available, by the same artists should be on
exhibition.

The review work may be conducted as a contest in which
the pictures are held up, one at a time, while the class writes
the name of the picture and the artist on slips of paper which
have been prepared and numbered for that purpose. One
teacher who used this device surprised her class by presenting
those whose lists were correct with their choice of any of the
large-sized Perry pictures studied.

Many teachers, however, will prefer to use this time for
composition work, although the description of pictures is often
given as an English lesson. Pupils may write a description of[Pg 76]
their favorite picture. In fact, the lessons can be made to
correlate with history, geography, English, spelling, reading, or
nature study.

In any event the real purpose of the work is that the pupils
shall become so familiar with the pictures that they will recognize
them as old friends whenever and wherever they may see
them.

It is hoped that acquaintance with the picture and the
interest awakened by its story will grow into a fuller appreciation
and understanding of the artist's work. Thus the children
will have many happy hours and will learn to love the good,
the true, and the beautiful in everything about them.

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
