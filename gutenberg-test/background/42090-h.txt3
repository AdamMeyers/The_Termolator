THE FAR WEST

[PART II]



XXXIII[1]


"Stranger, if thou hast learn'd a truth which needs
Experience more than reason, that the world
Is full of guilt and misery, and hast known
Enough of all its sorrows, crimes, and cares
To tire thee of it; enter this wild wood,
And view the haunts of Nature."
Bryant.



The moon had gone down; the last star had burned
out in the firmament; and that deep darkness which
precedes the dawn was brooding over the earth as the
traveller turned away from the little inn at the village of
Pinkneyville. Fortunately he had, the previous evening,
while surveying the face of the region from the door of
the hostelrie, gained some general idea of the route to
127 Kaskaskia; and now, dropping the reins upon his
horse's neck, he began floundering along through a
blackness of darkness perfectly Cimmerian. It was,
indeed, a gloomy night. The early mists were rising,
damp and chill, from the soil saturated with the showers
of the preceding day; and the darkness had become of
a density almost palpable to the sense. Crossing a narrow
arm of the prairie in the direction presumed to be
correct, my horse carried me into a dense wood, and, if
possible, the darkness increased. I had penetrated some[Pg 20]
miles into the heart of the forest, and was advancing
slowly upon my way, when my attention was suddenly
arrested by a low, whispering, rustling sound in the
depths of the wood at my right; this gradually increasing,
was almost immediately succeeded by a crashing,
thundering, rushing report, till every echo far and wide
in that dark old wood was wakened, and the whole forest
for miles around resounded with the roar. My horse,
terrified at the noise, leaped and plunged like a mad
creature. An enormous forest-tree had fallen within
a dozen rods of the spot on which I stood. As I left
the noble ruin and resumed my lonely way, my mind
brooded over the event, and I thought I could perceive in
the occurrence a powerful feature of the sublime. The
fall of an aged tree in the noiseless lapse of time is ever
an event not unworthy of notice; but, at a moment like
this, it was surely so in an eminent degree. Ages since       long
ere the first white man had pressed the soil of
this Western world, and while the untamed denizens of
the wilderness 128 roamed in the freedom of primitive
creation       ages since had seen the germe of that
mighty tree lifting up its young, green leaf from the sod,
beneath the genial warmth of the sunlight and the summer
wind. An age passed away. The tender stem had reared
itself into a gigantic pillar, and proudly tossed its green
head amid the upper skies: that young leaf, expanded and
developed, had spread itself abroad, until, at length, the
beasts of the earth had sought out its shade, and the tree
stood up the monarch of the forest. Another age is gone,
and the hoary moss of time is flaunting to the winds from
its venerable branches. Long ago the thunderbolt had
consecrated its lofty top with the baptismal of fire, and, sere
and rifted, the storm-cloud now sings through its naked
limbs. Like an aged man, its head is bleached with[Pg 21]
years, while the strength and verdure of ripened maturity
yet girdle its trunk. But the worm is at the root: rottenness
at the heart is doing its work. Its day and its hour
are appointed, and their bounds it may not pass. That
hour, that moment is come! and in the deep, pulseless
stillness of the night-time, when slumber falleth upon
man and Nature pauses in her working, the offspring
of centuries is laid low, and bows himself along the earth.
Yet another age is gone; but the traveller comes not to
muse over the relics of the once-glorious ruin. Long
ago has each been mouldering away, and their dust has
mingled with the common mother of us all. Ah! there
is a moral in the falling of an aged tree!

129 I was dwelling with rather melancholy reflections
upon this casual occurrence, when a quick panting close
at my side attracted my attention; a large, gaunt-looking
prairie-wolf had just turned on his heel and was trotting
off into the shade. The gray dawn had now begun to
flicker along the sky, and, crossing a beautiful prairie
and grove, I found myself at the pleasant farmhouse of a
settler of some twenty or thirty years' standing; and dismounting,
after a ride of eighteen miles, I partook, with
little reluctance or ceremony, of an early breakfast. Thus
much for the night adventures of a traveller in the woods
and wilds of Illinois! My host, the old gentleman to
whom I have referred, very sagely mistook his guest for
a physician, owing to a peculiarly convenient structure
of those indispensables ycleped saddle-bags; and was
just about consulting his fancied man of medicines respecting
the ailings of his "woman," who was reclining
on a bed, when, to his admiration, he was undeceived.

Passing through an inconsiderable village on the
north side of the Little Vermillion called Georgetown,
my route lay through an extended range of hills and[Pg 22]
barrens.[2] Among the former were some most intolerably
tedious, especially to a horseman beneath a broiling sun,
who had passed a sleepless night: but the sweep of scenery
from their summits was beautiful and extensive. At
length the traveller stood upon the "heights of Chester,"
and the broad Mississippi was rolling on its turbid floods
a hundred yards beneath. The view is here a noble
130 one, not unlike that from the Alton or Grafton
bluffs at the other extremity of the "American Bottom,"
though less extensive. Directly at the feet of the spectator,
scattered along a low, narrow interval, lies the village
of Chester. Upon the opposite bank the forest rolls
away to the horizon in unbroken magnificence, excepting
that here and there along the bottom the hand of cultivation
is betrayed by the dark luxuriance of waving maize-fields.
A beautiful island, with lofty trees and green
smiling meadows, stretches itself along in the middle
of the stream before the town, adding not a little to the
picturesqueness of the scene, and, in all probability,
destined to add something more to the future importance
of the place. To the right, at a short distance,
come in the soft-flowing waters of the Kaskaskia through
deeply-wooded banks; and nearly in the same direction
winds away the mirror-surface of the Mississippi for twenty
miles, to accomplish a direct passage of but four, an occurrence[Pg 23]
by no means unusual in its course. As I stood gazing
upon the scene, a steamer appeared sweeping around
the bend, and, puffing lazily along with the current past
the town, soon disappeared in the distance. From the
heights an exceedingly precipitous pathway leads down
to the village. Chester is one of the new places of Illinois,
and, of course, can boast but little to interest the stranger
apart from the highly scenic beauty of its situation.[3] It
has been mostly erected within the few years past; and,
for its extent, is a flourishing business place. Its landing
is excellent, location healthy, 131 adjacent region
fertile, and, for aught I know to the contrary, may, in
course of years, rival even the far-famed Alton. Its
landing, I was informed, is the only one for many miles
upon the river, above or below, suitable for a place of
extensive commerce.

From Chester, in a direction not far from north, a narrow
pathway winds along beneath the bluffs, among the tall
cane-brakes of the bottom. Leaving the Mississippi at
the mouth of the Kaskaskia, it runs along the low banks
of the latter stream, and begins to assume an aspect truly
delightful. Upon either side rise the shafts of enormous
sycamores to the altitude of an hundred feet, and then,
flinging abroad and interlacing their long branches, form
a living arch of exquisite beauty, stretching away in unbroken
luxuriance for miles. Beneath springs from the rich
loam a dense undergrowth of canes; a profusion of wild
vines and bushes clustering with fruit serving effectually
to exclude the sunbeams, except a few checkered spots
here and there playing upon the foliage, while at intervals[Pg 24]
through the dark verdure is caught the flashing sheen
of the moving waters. Upon the right, at the distance of
only a few yards, go up the bluffs to the sheer height
of some hundred feet, densely clothed with woods. The
path, though exceedingly narrow and serpentine, is for
the most part a hard-trodden, smooth, and excellent one
when dry. The coolness and fragrance of these deep,
old, shadowy woodlands has always for me a resistless
charm. There is so much of quiet seclusion from the
feverish turmoil of ordinary life within 132 their peaceful
avenues, that, to one not wedded to the world, they are
ever inexpressibly grateful.


"The calm shade
Shall bring a kindred calm, and the sweet breeze,
That makes the green leaves dance, shall waft a balm
To thy sick heart. Thou wilt find nothing here
Of all that pain'd thee in the haunts of men,
And made thee loathe thy life."


In the wild, fierce glaring of a summer noontide, when
amid "the haunts of men" all is parched up, and dusty,
and scathed, how refreshingly cool are the still depths of
the forest! The clear crystal streamlet gushes forth with
perennial laughter from the rock, seeming to exult in
its happy existence; the bright enamelled mosses of a century
creep along the gnarled old roots, and life in all its
fairy forms trips forth to greet the eremite heart and charm
it from the world. But there was one feature of the scene
through which I was passing that struck me as peculiarly
imposing, and to which I have not yet referred.
I allude to the enormous, almost preternatural magnitude
of the wild-grape vine, and its tortuosity. I have more than
once, in the course of my wanderings, remarked the peculiarities
of these vast parasites; but such is the unrivalled
fertility, and the depth of soil of the Kaskaskia bottom,
that vegetation of every kind there attains a size and proportion[Pg 25]
elsewhere almost unknown. Six or seven of these
vast vegetable serpents are usually beheld leaping forth
with a broad whirl from the mould at the root of a tree,
and then, writhing, and twining, and twisting 133 among
themselves into all imaginable forms, at length away they
start, all at once and together, in different directions for
the summit, around which they immediately clasp their
bodies, one over the other, and swing depending in festoons
on every side. Some of these vines, when old and
dried up by the elements, are amazingly strong; more so,
perhaps, than a hempen hawser of the same diameter.

Having but a short ride before me the evening I left
Chester, I alighted from my horse, and leisurely strolled
along through this beautiful bower I have been attempting
to describe. What a charming spot, thought I, for a
Romeo and Juliet!       pardon my roving fancy, sober reader       but
really, with all my own sobriety, I could not but
imagine this a delightful scene for a "Meet me by moonlight
alone," or any other improper thing of the kind,
whether or not a trip to Gretna Green subsequently ensued.
And if, in coming years, when the little city of
Chester shall have become all that it now seems to promise,
and the venerable Kaskaskia, having cast her slough, having
rejuvenated her withered energies, and recalled the
days of her pristine traditionary glory; if then, I say, the
young men and maidens make not this the consecrated
spot of the long summer-evening ramble and the trysting-place
of the heart, reader, believe us not; in the dignified
parlance of the corps editorial, believe us not.

Some portions of the Kaskaskia bottom have formerly,
at different times, been cleared and cultivated; but nothing
now remains but the ruins of 134 tenements to acquaint
one with the circumstance. The spot must have been exceedingly
unhealthy in its wild state. There is, however,[Pg 26]
one beautiful and extensive farm under high cultivation
nearly opposite Kaskaskia, which no traveller can fail to
observe and admire. It is the residence of Colonel M              ,
a French gentleman of wealth, who has done everything
a cultivated taste could dictate to render it a delightful
spot.[4] A fine, airy farmhouse stands beneath the bluffs,
built after the French style, with heavy roof, broad balconies,
and with a rare luxury in this region       green Venetian
blinds. The outhouses, most of them substantially
constructed of stone, are surpassed in beauty and extent
only by the residence itself. Fields yellow with golden
harvest, orchards loaded with fruit, and groves, and parks,
and pastures sprinkled with grazing cattle, spread out
themselves on every side. In the back-ground rise the
wooded bluffs, gracefully rounded to their summits, while
in front roams the gentle Kaskaskia, beyond which, peacefully
reposing in the sunlight, lay the place of my destination.

Kaskaskia, Ill.




XXXIV



"Protected by the divinity they adored, supported by the earth which they
cultivated, and at peace with themselves, they enjoyed the sweets of life without
dreading or desiring dissolution."       Numa Pompilius.


"A pleasing land of drowsy head it was,
Of dreams that wave before the half-shut eye."
Castle of Indolence.



In a country like our own, where everything is fresh and
recent, and where nothing has yet been swept by the mellowing
touch of departed time, any object which can lay
but the most indifferent claim to antiquity fails not to be
hailed with delighted attention. "You have," say they[Pg 27]
of the other hemisphere, "no ivy-mantled towers; no moss-grown,
castellated ruins; no donjon-keeps rearing in dark
sublimity their massive walls and age-bleached battlements;
nothing to span the mighty chasm of bygone years, and to
lead down the fancy into the shadowy realms of the past;
and, therefore, your country is steril in moral interest."
Now, though this corollary is undoubtedly false, I yet believe
the proposition in the main to be true: especially is this
the case with regard to that region which lies west of the
Alleghany range. Little as there may be in the elder sections
of our Atlantic states to demand veneration for the
past, no sooner does the traveller find himself gliding along
the silvery wave 136 of the "beautiful river," than at the
same moment he finds himself forsaking all that the fairy
creations of genius have ever consecrated, or the roll of
the historian chronicled for coming time. All is NEW.
The very soil on which he treads, fertile beyond comparison,
and festering beneath the undisturbed vegetation of centuries;
the rolling forests, bright, luxuriant, gorgeous as on
the dawn of creation; the endless streams pouring onward
in their fresh magnificence to the ocean, all seem new.
The inhabitants are emigrants late from other lands, and
every operation of human skill on which the eye may rest
betrays a recent origin. There is but a single exception
to these remarks       those mysterious monuments of a
race whom we know not of!

In consideration, therefore, of the circumstance that
antiquities in this blessed land of ours are, indeed, very
few and far between, I deem it the serious duty of every
traveller, be he virtuoso or be he not, whenever once so
happy as to lay his grasp upon an antique "in any form,
in any shape," just to hold fast to the best of his ability!
Such, reader, be it known, was my own praiseworthy determination
when drawing nigh to the eastern shore of the[Pg 28]
stream opposite the ancient French village Kaskaskia.
The sun was going down, and as I approached the sandy
edge of the sea-green water, a gay bevy of young folks
were whirling the long, narrow, skiff-like ferry-boat like a
bird across the stream, by means of a hawser to which it
was attached, and which extended from shore to shore. In
my own turn I stepped into the boat, and in a few moments
the old French 137 negro had forced it half across the
river, at this spot about three or four hundred yards in
width. For one who has ever visited Kaskaskia in the
last beautiful days of summer, a pen like my own need
hardly be employed to delineate the loveliness of the scene
which now opened upon the view. For miles the gleamy
surface of the gentle Kaskaskia might be seen retreating
from the eye, till lost at length in its windings through the
forests of its banks, resting their deep shadows on the stream
in all the calm magnificence of inanimate nature. The
shore I was leaving swelled gracefully up from the water's
edge, clothed in forests until it reached the bluffs, which
towered abrupt and loftily; while here and there along the
landscape the low roof of a log cabin could be caught peeping
forth from the dark shrubbery. The bank of the stream
I was approaching presented an aspect entirely the reverse;
less lovely, but more picturesque. A low sandy beach
stretched itself more than a mile along the river, destitute
of trees, and rounding itself gently away into a broad
green plain. Upon this plain       a portion of the American
Bottom       at the distance of a few hundred yards from
the water, is situated all that now remains of "old Kaskaskia."
From the centre rises a tall Gothic spire, hoary
with time, surmounted by an iron cross; and around this
nucleus are clustered irregularly, at various intervals, the
heavy-roofed, time-stained cottages of the French inhabitants.
These houses are usually like those of the West[Pg 29]
India planters       but a single story in height       and the
surface which they occupy is, 138 of course, in the larger
class, proportionably increased. They are constructed,
some of rough limestone, some of timber, framed in every
variety of position       horizontal, perpendicular, oblique,
or all united       thus retaining their shape till they rot to
the ground, with the interstices stuffed with the fragments
of stone, and the external surface stuccoed with mortar;
others       a few only       are framed, boarded, etc., in modern
style. Nearly all have galleries in front, some of them
spacious, running around the whole building, and all have
garden-plats enclosed by stone walls or stoccades. Some
of these curious-looking structures are old, having bided
the storm-winds of more than a century. It is this circumstance
which throws over the place that antiquated, venerable
aspect to which I have alluded, and which equally
applies to all the other villages of this peculiar people I
have yet spoken of. The city of Philadelphia and this
neglected village of Kaskaskia are, as regards age, the same
to a year;[5] but while every object which, in the one, meets
the eye, looks fresh as if but yesterday touched by the last
chiselling of the architect, in the latter the thoughts are
carried back at least to Noah's ark! Two centuries have
rolled by since the "city of the Pilgrims" ceased to be a
"cornfield;" but where will you now look for a solitary
relic of that olden time? "State-street," the scene where
American blood was first poured out by British soldiery;[Pg 30]
"Old Cornhill;" the site of the "Liberty-tree;" and the
wharf from which the tea was poured into the dock, are
indeed pointed out to you as spots memorable 139 in
the history of the "Leaguer of Boston;" and yonder frowns
the proud height of Bunker's Hill; there lay the British
battle-ships, and there was "burning Charlestown:" but,
with almost the solitary exception of the "Old South"
Church, with the cannon-ball imbedded in its tower, where
shall we look for an object around which our associations
may cluster? This is not the case with these old villages.
A century has looked down upon the same objects, in the
same situations and under the same relations, with a change
scarcely appreciable. Yon aged church-tower has thrown
its venerable shadow alike over the Indian corn-dance,
the rude cotillon of the French villager, the Spanish fandango,
the Virginia reel, and the Yankee frolic. Thus,
then, when I speak of these places with reference to antiquity,
I refer not so much to the actual lapse of years as
to the present aspect and age of the individual objects.
In this view there are few spots in our country which may
lay more undisputed claim to antiquity than these early
French settlements in the Western Valley.

There is one feature of these little villages to which I
have not at this time alluded, but which is equally amusing
and characteristic, and which never fails to arrest the
stranger's observation. I refer to the narrowness of those
avenues intended for streets. It is no very strange thing
that in aged Paris structure should be piled upon structure
on either side even to the clouds, while hardly a footpath
exists between; but that in this vast Western world a custom,
in all respects the same, should have prevailed, 140
surpasseth understanding. This must have resulted not
surely from lack of elbow-room, but from the marvellous
sociality of the race, or from that attachment to the customs[Pg 31]
of their own fatherland which the Frenchman ever
betrays. In agriculture and the mechanic arts they are
now about as well skilled, notwithstanding the improvements
which they must perceive have been going on around
them, as on the day their fathers first planted foot on this
broad land. The same implements of husbandry and
the arts which a century since were seen in France, are
now seen here; the very vehicle they drive is the vineyard-car,
which is presented us in representations of rustic
life in the older provinces of the same land. The same
characteristics of feeling and action are here displayed
as there, and the Gallic tongue is sacredly transmitted from
father to son. But here the parallel ceases. We can
trace but little resemblance between the staid, simple-hearted
French villager of the Mississippi Valley, and the
gay, frivolous, dissolute cotemporary of the fifteenth Louis;
still less to the countryman of a Marat or a Robespierre,
rocked upon the bloody billow of the "Reign of Terror;"
and less than either to the high-minded, polished Frenchman
of the nineteenth century. The same fact has been
remarked of the Spanish population of Florida and Mexico;
their resemblance to their ancestors, who have been slumbering
for more than three centuries in their graves, is far
more striking than to their present brethren of "Old Castile."
The cause of this is not difficult to detect. The customs,
the 141 manners, the very idioms of nations never remain
for any considerable period of time invariably the
same: other men, other times, other circumstances, when
assisted by civil or religious revolutions, produce surprising
changes in the parent land, while the scanty colony, separated
by mountains and seas, not more from the roar and
commotion than from the influenced sphere of these events,
slumbers quietly on from century to century, handing down
from father to son those peculiarities, unaltered, which[Pg 32]
migrated with them. Climate, soil, location, though far
from exclusive, are by no means inconsiderable agents
in affecting character in all its relations of intellect, temperament,
and physical feature. And thus has it chanced
that we now look upon a race of men separated but a few
centuries from the parent stock, yet exhibiting characteristics
in which there are few traits common to both.

It was through one of those long, narrow, lane-like
streets to which I have alluded, and, withal, a most unconscionably
filthy one, that I rode from the landing of
the ferry to the inn. The low-roofed, broad-galleried
cottages on either side seemed well stocked with a race
of dark-eyed, dark-haired, swarthy-looking people, all,
from the least unto the tallest, luxuriating in the mellow
atmosphere of evening; all, as if by the same right, staring
most unceremoniously at the stranger; and all apparently
summing up, but in the uncouthest style imaginable, their
divers surmises respecting his country, lineage, occupation,
etc., etc. The forms and features of these French
villagers are perfectly unique, at least in our 142 country,
and one can hardly fail distinguishing them at first
sight, even among a crowd, once having seen them.
Their peculiarities are far more striking than those of our
German or Irish population. A few well-dressed, genteel
gentlemen were lounging about the piazza of the inn as
I drew nigh, and a polite landlord, courteously pressing
forward, held the stirrup of the traveller and requested
him to alight. Something of a contrast, this, to the attention
a stranger usually is blessed with from not more than
nine tenths of the worthy publicans of Illinois. Alas! for
the aristocracy of the nineteenth century! But n'importe.
With the easy air of gentility and taste which seemed to
pervade the inn at Kaskaskia in all its departments, few
could have failed to be pleased. For myself, I was also[Pg 33]
surprised. Everything about the establishment was in
the French style, and here was spread the handsomest
table d'hôte it has been my fortune to witness in Illinois.

The moon was pouring gloriously down in misty mellowness
upon the low-roofed tenements of this antiquated
village, when, leaving my chamber, I stepped from the
inn for a leisure stroll through its streets and lanes. Passing
the gray old church,[6] bathed in the dim, melting moonlight
of a summer night, such as for more than a century
had smiled upon its consecrated walls as one year had
chased away another, the next considerable structure
which arrested my attention was a huge, ungainly edifice
of brick, like Joseph's coat, of many colours, forsooth, and,
withal, sadly ruinous as regards the item of windows.
This latter circumstance, aside from 143 every other,
agreeable to all observed precedent, would have notified
me of the fact that this was neither more nor less than a
western courthouse. Continuing my careless ramble
among the cottages, I passed several whose piazzas were
thronged with young people; and at intervals from the
midst rang out, on the mild evening air, the gay fresh laugh,
and the sweet, soft tones of woman. A stately structure
of stone, buried in foliage, next stood beside me, and
from its open doors and windows issued the tumultuous
melody of the piano. A few steps, and the innocent
merriment of two young girls hanging upon a gentleman's
arms struck my ear. They passed me. Both were young;
and one, a gazelle-eyed brunette, in the pale moonlight,
was beautiful. The blithe creatures were full of frolic
and fun, and the light Gallic tongue seemed strangely[Pg 34]
musical from those bright lips. But enough       enough
of my evening's ramble       nay, more than enough: I am
waxing sentimental. It was at a late hour, after encountering
divers untold adventures, that I found myself once
more at my hotel. The gallery was thronged with French
gentlemen, and it was some hours before the laugh and
chatter had died away, and the old village was buried in
slumber.

Kaskaskia, Ill.

"Glanced many a light caïque along the foam,
Danced on the shore the daughters of the land."
Byron.



"How changed the scene since merry Jean Baptiste
Paddled his pirouge on La Belle Rivière,
And from its banks some lone Loyola priest
Echoed the night song of the voyageur."



It is now more than a century and a half since the
sturdy Canadian voyageurs, treading in the footsteps of the
adventurous Sieur la Salle, forsaking the bleak shores and
wintry skies of the St. Lawrence, first planted themselves
upon the beautiful hunting-grounds of the peaceful Illini.
Long before the Pilgrim Fathers of New-England, or the
distressed exiles of Jamestown, scattered along the steril
shores of the Atlantic, had formed even a conception of
the beautiful valley beyond the mountains       while this
vast North American continent was yet but a wilderness,
and the nations of Christendom, ignorant of its character
or of its extent, knew not by whom of right it should be
appropriated       a few French Jesuit priests had ascended
in their bark canoes a distance of three thousand miles
from the mouth of the "endless river," and had explored
its tributaries to their fountains. It is with admiration[Pg 35]
almost bordering on astonishment that we view the bold
adventures of these daring men.[7] 145 The cause of
their fearless undertaking was, we are told, to investigate
the truth of an idea which at that era was prevalent among
the Canadian French, that a western passage through the
American continent existed to the Pacific Ocean. The
Indian hunters had spoken of a vast stream far away to
the west, which on their long excursions they had seen,
but of whose source, course, or termination they could tell
nothing. This river was supposed to disgorge itself into
the Pacific Seas; and, to prosecute the inquiry, Father
Marquette, a recollet monk, and Sieur Joliet, an Indian
trader of Quebec, by authority of M. Talon, Intendant
of New France, a man of singular enterprise, entered upon
the expedition. Thridding the great chain of the Northern
Lakes in their slender skiffs, and pursuing the Ouisconsin
River, on the 17th of June, 1673, the first Europeans descended
the "Father of Waters."[8] By the natives whom
they met they were kindly received, and entertained with
a deference due only to superior beings. Among these
Indians, the Illini, then residing on both sides of the Mississippi,
were chief, and their nation was made up of seven
distinct tribes: the Miamies, Michigamies, Mascotins,
Kaskaskias, Kahokias, Peorias, and Taumarwaus, a peaceful,
benevolent, unwarlike race.[9] A village was found
at the mouth of the Illinois. Descending the Mississippi,
the French voyageurs were dissuaded from their design
of exploring the Missouri by a tradition of the natives that[Pg 36]
near its mouth dwelt a Manito, whose residence no human
being could pass with life: nor did the Indians fail to tell
the legend of 146 the Piasa cliff above. Turning up the
Illinois, therefore, they glided with amazement through
the green woodlands and over the silvery wave of that
beautiful stream. It is, perhaps, at this distant day, and
in the present era of "speculators and economists," hardly
possible to conceive the delighted emotions which must
then have swelled the bosoms of those simple-hearted men.
Sieur Joliet, on his return to Canada, published an account
of his adventures, in which narrative language seems
almost too meager for description of the golden land he
had seen.[10] Father Marquette remained a missionary
among the peaceful Indians. To the river partially
explored was given the name of the celebrated Colbert,
Minister of Marine, by Count de Frontenac; and to the
trader Joliet, as a reward, was granted the island of
Anticosti in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.[11]

Years passed away, and no enterprising spirit rose up
to prosecute the discoveries already made. The missionary
Marquette died among the Indians two years after,
and Joliet took possession of his island. At length appears
M. Robert, Cavalier de la Salle, a native of Rouen in Normandy,
celebrated as the birthplace of Fontenelle and
the two Corneilles, and for the martyrdom of the heroic
Maid of Orleans more than two centuries before. La[Pg 37]
Salle was a man of bold talents and dauntless enterprise.
Ambitious of fame and wealth, he emigrated to Canada;
listened to the wonderful tales of the endless river; conceived
the idea of a Northwest Passage to the East Indies; communicated
his views to the commandant of Fort Frontenac
on Lake Ontario, 147 and was advised to lay his plan
before the Court of St. Cloud. On his arrival at Paris,
under the patronage of the Prince de Conti, La Salle
received letters of nobility and extensive grants of land
in America. Associating with himself the Chevalier de
Tonti, an Italian officer, who had the peculiarity of a copper
hand as substitute to one lost in the wars of Sicily,
and Father Lewis Hennepin, a Franciscan friar, as historian
and missionary, together with about thirty others,
the enterprise was immediately entered upon, under special
sanction of Louis XIV., king of France. After a variety
of fortune, prosperous and adverse, they reached the Illinois,
and having descended that beautiful river some distance,
discovered an Indian village consisting of five hundred
cabins completely deserted. Here, having found a large
quantity of corn concealed in the earth under each of the
wigwams, the party remained six days. Descending
ninety miles, they came to Peoria Lake, where they found
two encampments of the natives. At first hostility was
manifested, but soon they were on most amicable terms
with the voyageurs, and a feasting, and dancing, and rejoicing
was kept up for three days. Not long after this
the boat containing supplies was lost upon "Le Baie des
Puants," or Green Bay; and La Salle was forced to
erect a fort, which received the appropriate name of
"Creve C      ur"       broken heart. The site of this fortification
is supposed to have been a spot now called "Spring Bay,"
not far from Peoria, on the Illinois. This is a singular
place. It is a broad sand basin, some hundred feet 148[Pg 38]
in diameter, opening upon the river, the waters of which,
in the higher stages, fill it to the brim, but when low they
retire, and a number of large springs gush copiously forth
from three sides of the ridge, and form a stream. "Blue
Creek" empties itself just below, crossed by a bridge of
earth, while yet farther down is seen a large mound, which
has been opened, and found to contain human remains
twenty feet from the summit.[12]

At the time of the erection of Fort Creve C      ur the Illini
were at war with the warlike Iroquois Indians; and the
former, anticipating assistance from their friends the
French, and receiving none, resolved to destroy La Salle.
His boldness and eloquence alone saved him and restored
amity. No sooner was this disturbance quelled than a
mutiny arose among his own men. On Christmas-day
his dinner was poisoned, and powerful medicine alone
saved his life.

Preparations were now made to explore the Mississippi.
Father Hennepin, with four Frenchmen, two Indians,
and M. Dacan, commander, ascended the river to the falls,
and named them, in honour of their patron saint, St. Anthony.
They were here taken prisoners by a party of
Sioux, carried one hundred and sixty miles into the interior
to their villages, and detained several months, when they
regained their liberty. Father Hennepin returned to
Canada, and subsequently to France, where he published
his travels in splendid style, dedicating the book to the
celebrated Colbert. These early writings, though deeply
imbued with a spirit of superstition 149 and exaggeration,
are yet valuable as the only records of the time.[13] The chief[Pg 39]
of these historians were Hennepin, Tonti, and Charlevoix.[14]
Difficulties arising with the Indians, La Salle resolved to
erect another fort, which, after infinite difficulty, was completed.
The site is described as "a rock, very high, the top
of which was even and of convenient space, so that it
commanded the river and country round about." This
description applies to no place on the Illinois so well as
to the "Starved Rock." The fort was called "St. Louis."

La Salle visited Canada, and a crowd of adventurers
returned with him. Descending the Illinois and Mississippi,
the company stopped for some time at the mouth
of the Missouri, then the Osage River, and found a village
of the Taumarwaus, which was deserted, the natives being
on a hunting expedition. In three days they were at the
Oubachi or Ohio. At the Chicasaw Bluffs a fort called
Prudhomme was erected, and formal possession of the
country first taken, and, in honour of the reigning monarch,[Pg 40]
named Louisiana. Several other forts were erected, and
one of them, the ruins of which yet remain, is supposed to
have stood between St. Louis and Carondelet. Descending
the river on the 7th of April, 1683, La Salle reached
the Gulf of Mexico, where a Te Deum was sung; a cross,
with the arms of France, was suspended from the summit
of a lofty tree; and the river, which had occupied three
months in its exploration of about one thousand miles,
was named "St. 150 Louis." On his return, the associates
of La Salle founded the villages of Kaskaskia and
Cahokia on the American Bottom, while he hastened on
to Canada and thence to France, to obtain a colony for
the country at the mouth of the Mississippi. Losing his
route on returning with this expedition, he commenced a
journey over land to Illinois; but, while on his way, was
treacherously assassinated by two of his followers.[15]
It is a remarkable fact in the history of retributive justice,[Pg 41]
that these men soon after dealt death to each other; and
two priests of the mutineers became penitent, and confessed
all the circumstances of the crime. The burial spot of
the noble La Salle is unknown to this day. Marquette,
"the apostle of the wilderness," died under circumstances
of touching interest on the lonely shores of Lake Michigan
while upon his mission. Charlevoix, the historian, throws
an interest of melancholy romance over the fate of this
venerable man. According to this writer, Father Joseph
Marquette was a native of Laon, in Picardy, and of distinguished
family. About two years after his discovery
of the Mississippi, while engaged in his missionary labours
among the savages, he was journeying from Chicago to
Michillimackinac, and on the 8th of May, 1675, entered
the mouth of a small river emptying into Lake Michigan
upon its eastern side, which now bears his name. Here
he landed, erected an altar, and said mass. After this
ceremony he retired a short distance, and requested the
two voyageurs who conducted his canoe to leave him alone
for half an hour, while in private 151 he returned thanks.
The period having expired, they went to seek him, and
found him dead in the attitude of devotion:[16] the circumstance
then recurred to them, that, on entering the river,
he had dropped an intimation that he should there end his
days. The distance was too great to Michillimackinac to
convey there his remains, and the voyageurs accordingly
buried them near the bank of the stream, which they called
by his name. From that time the river, as if from reverence
for the missionary's relics, has continued to retire,
and his grave is yet pointed out to the traveller. Thus
did the venerable Marquette, at an advanced age, alone
with his God, yield up his blameless life to its giver, while[Pg 42]
engaged in his holy errand of peace to the savage, and
amid the magnificent solitudes of the land of his discovery.

Subsequent to these explorations, colonies from Lower
Canada rapidly settled the recent villages of Kaskaskia,
Cahokia, and Peoria.[17] But their designs seem not to have
been those of the speculators of our own day. Their sole
anticipation was to amass opulence by mining in a country
then supposed incalculably rich in the precious metals,
from its resemblance to the silver region of South America;
and we find exclusive grants of extensive tracts bearing
this date to Cruzat, Renault, and other individuals.[18] In
pursuit of this golden chimera, many expeditions were
fitted out at vast expense. In 1699 M. de Seur, an enterprising
traveller, with ninety men, descended the Mississippi
to a spot six hundred miles above the Illinois, and
erected a fort 152 upon the present site of Fort Armstrong
for the purpose of exploring a mine of terre verte, said to[Pg 43]
have been discovered in that beautiful region.[19] It need
hardly be said that all these adventurers were disappointed:
but the buoyant hilarity of the race did not forsake them,
and as boatmen, hunters, couriers du bois, Indian traders,
and small farmers,[20] they gained a comfortable subsistence,
and merrily did they enjoy it. Most of their lives were
passed upon the broad prairies, and in penetrating every
section of this vast valley in their birch pirogues wherever
a stream presented to them its bosom; and yet with the
violin, the grape-juice, and a short pipe, they seemed the
blithest mortals on the face of the earth. It was by men
such as these that the village of Kaskaskia, in old French
chronicles styled "Notre dame de Cascasquias," originating
in the name and residence of an Indian tribe, first was[Pg 44]
settled; and in a few years it had become an extensive depôt
for the trade in furs. It was probably by the same Indian
tribe which originally possessed the site of Kaskaskia that
a party of the unfortunate expedition of Ferdinand de Soto,
by whom Florida was partially conquered, was almost
destroyed about the year 1539. Indeed, there was a tradition
still extant upon the arrival of the French, of their
having exterminated the first white faces they had ever
seen. For three years did the chivalrous De Soto, with
his nine hundred steel-clad warriors, scour the land in
search of the reality of his golden dreams: at length he
died; he was an object of hatred and terror to the Indians;
and to conceal his death, or to 153 preserve from violation
his remains, his followers enclosed them in a coffin
constructed from the section of a hollow tree, and sunk
them beneath the floods of the eternal river. His followers,
reduced to only two hundred and fifty, returned to Spain.
And so the burial-places of the first explorers of the Mississippi
are unknown.[21]

The extent of the territory of Kaskaskia was originally
very great, stretching from the Kaskaskia River to the
Mississippi, a breadth of about two miles, and comprising
the area from the confluence of the streams, seven
miles below, to the present site of the place. The tract
below the town is incalculably fertile, abounding in the[Pg 45]
plum, the persimmon, the cherry, the delicate pecan, the
hickory, and the hazel-nut; and for the most part was comprised
in one vast "common field," over which herds of
wild horses, introduced by the emigrants, long roamed
in undisturbed possession. This common, consisting of
seven thousand acres, was granted "to Kaskaskia and
inhabitants for ever" by Vaudreuil, governor of the Province
of Louisiana, as early as 1743.[22] In this arrangement we
observe a striking feature in the policy both of the French
and Spanish governments, in their early settlements on
the Mississippi. The items of door-yards, gardens, stable-yards,
etc., and of settling colonies in the compact form
of towns and villages, as a protection from the savages
and to promote social intercourse, were all matters of special
requisition and enactment; while to each 154 settlement
was granted two tracts of land for "common fields" and
"commons." This distinction was not, however, invariably
observed. The former consisted of several hundred
acres, conveniently divided among the individual families,
and the whole enclosed by the labour of all the villagers[Pg 46]
in common. If the enclosure opposite any plat was suffered
to become ruinous, the right to the common was forfeited
by the offending individual. The seasons, also, for ploughing,
sowing, reaping, etc., were by public ordinance simultaneous:
yet with these restrictions, each individual, so
long as he complied with the necessary regulations, possessed
his lot in franc allieu       fee simple, subject to sale
and transfer. The "common" was a far more extended
tract, embracing in some instances several thousand acres
without enclosure, and reserved for the purpose of wood
and pasturage. Here there was no grant of severalty,
and no individual portion could be appropriated without
the special and unanimous consent of the whole village.
To the indigent who came to settle among them, and to
young married pairs, donations from this tract were often
made by the villagers, and, if conveniently situated, might[Pg 47]
subsequently become a portion of the "common field."[23]
That such an arrangement, under all the circumstances
of the period when instituted, and with such a people as
the early French settlers, was the best that could have
been made, no one can doubt. But how such a regulation
would suit a race of enterprising Yankees, fidgeting eternally
for improvements, or a squad of long-sided Kentuckians,
grumbling about elbow-room, is problematical.

155 The proceedings of our national government towards
these ancient villages have been characterized by
generosity, whatever may be said of the conduct of individuals.
In 1788, an extensive tract lying along the
Mississippi was by act of Congress granted to the French
inhabitants east of that river; and to those of Kaskaskia
was secured for a common field twenty thousand acres.
It is under direction of the trustees of the town by provision
of the state legislature.[24]

Unlike the policy of all other Europeans who have planted
themselves upon the Western continent, that of the French
emigrants towards the aborigines, with the single exception
of the extermination of the Natchez in the South, has
invariably been conciliatory, peaceable, and friendly.[Pg 48][25]
This has been the effect rather of debasing themselves
than of elevating the natives. Surrounded by everything
which could fascinate the eye or delight the fancy,
we find these inoffensive foreigners, therefore, unlike the
English settlers along the Atlantic and in the elder
Western states, at peace with all their savage neighbours;
unambitious, contented, and happy, increasing and flourishing;
and in a few years, they tell us, Kaskaskia, "the
terrestrial paradise," numbered a population of eight
thousand souls![26] Blessed with a soil of boundless fertility,
and prolific in all Nature's luxurious stores to a degree
of which less-favoured climes can form no conception:
subsisting solely by culture of the little homesteads around
their own thresholds, by hunting 156 the wild denizens
of their noble forests, or angling upon the calm bosom of
their beautiful stream: simple-hearted and peaceful, almost
without the terms of law, gently ruled by the restraints of
a religion they venerated and a priesthood they loved:
without commerce, the arts, or the elegances of life; a
thousand miles from a community of civilized men; from
year to year they went on, and from generation to generation
they flourished, until, in that of our own age and our
own day, they are found still treading in the steps in which
their fathers trod! So long as the peaceful French villager
retained the beautiful land of his adoption in undisputed
possession, all was flourishing and prosperous. A little
more than half a century from its origin, Kaskaskia was
capital of Illinois; and on the visit of Charlevoix in 1721,
a monastery and Jesuit college was in successful operation,
the ruins of the edifice remaining extant even at the[Pg 49]
present day.[27] This institution was successful in converting
a number of the aborigines to its peculiar tenets, and
at one period is said to have "embraced twenty-five hundred
catechumens!!" A most preposterous assertion, most
assuredly.

It was in the early part of this century that the scheme
of that celebrated projector, John Law, of Edinburgh,
on the strength of which he elevated himself to the dignity
of Comptroller-general of the Finance of France, was first
set on foot with reference to the Valley of the Mississippi.
The design, so far as it is now known, was to establish a
bank, an East India, and a Mississippi Company, from
157 the anticipated enormous revenue of which was to
be liquidated the national debt of France.[28] The territory
of Louisiana had already acquired a reputation abroad
for the boundlessness of the wealth and fertility of its soil;
and, to foster the delusion of Law's scheme, descriptions
of this beautiful region, tinted with all the rainbow hues
of romance, were scattered throughout Europe, until the
distant wilderness of les Illinois became the paradise of
the slumberer's vision. "The Illinois" was the fairyland
of fancy realized. A few years, the vast fabric of
fictitious credit crumbled, almost annihilating the finance
of France, and burying thousands of families in its ruins.[Pg 50]
Law was exiled and retired to Venice, where in poverty
he soon died. It is a coincidence not a little remarkable,
that the same year, 1720, witnessed the same desperate
game enacted by the South Sea directors in England.
But the attention of France was now directed towards
her remote colony in North America; and notwithstanding
the failure of Law's scheme, old Kaskaskia continued to
flourish beyond all compare. Other villages sprang into
existence around; a lucrative fur-trade was carried on
by the Canadian voyageurs, and agriculture became the
peculiar province of the French villager. The extent and
luxuriance of the agriculture at this period may be 158
gathered from the fact, that in the single year 1746, eight
hundred thousand weight of flour was sent to New Orleans
from these settlements.[29] At this period there was not a
solitary village west of the Mississippi, though the lead-mines
then known and worked were resorted to by traders.[30]
Twenty years after the failure of Law's scheme, the French
government formed the design, almost as chimerical, of
securing her immense possessions in the Mississippi Valley
by a continuous line of military posts, connecting them
with Canada; and vast were the sums of money expended
in the undertaking.

A century, and the whole region was ceded to England,
thence to our own government in 1783, and now old Kaskaskia
is but the wreck of its former prosperity. It makes
one almost sad to wander about among these ruinous,
deserted habitations, venerable with departed years, and
reflect that once they were thronged with population, the
seat of hospitality, and the home of kindly feeling. The
quiet villagers have been not a little annoyed by the steady[Pg 51]
and rapid influx of immigration on every side of them,
dissimilar in customs, language, religion, and temperament,
while the bustling enterprise has fretted and displeased
them. Long accustomed, also, to the arbitrary
but parental authority of their military commandants
and priesthood, they deemed the introduction of the common
law among them exceedingly burdensome, and the
duties of a citizen of a republic, of which we are so 159
proud, intolerable drudgery. Many, therefore, of the
wealthy and respectable, on cession of their territory to
our government, removed to Louisiana, where civil law
yet bears sway; others crossed the river and established
Ste. Genevieve and St. Louis;[31] while the foreigners returning
to the lands from which they had emigrated, few but
natives of the country remained behind. The ordinance
of 1787,[32] prohibiting involuntary servitude in the region
then called the Northwestern Territory, induced many
who were desirous of preserving their blacks to remove
to the new villages west of the Mississippi, then under
Spanish rule. From these and a variety of similar causes,
this peaceful, kind-hearted people have within the last
thirty years been more than once disturbed in the dwellings
of their fathers.

XXXVI



"If my readers should at any time remark that I am particularly dull, they may
rest assured there is a design under it."       British Essayist.


"Let not ambition mock their useful toil,
Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;
Nor grandeur hear with a disdainful smile
The short and simple annals of the poor."
Gray's Elegy.



Few things are more difficult, and, consequently, more
rarely met, than correct portraiture of character, whether
of the individual or of a community. It is easy enough,
indeed, to trace out the prominent outlines in the picture;
and with a degree of accuracy which shall render it easily
recognised, while yet the more delicate shading and lighting
is false; just as the artist may have transferred every
feature in exact form, size, and proportion to his canvass,
while the expression thrown over the whole may be incorrect.
This has more than once been the case in descriptions
hastily drawn of that singular being, the French
villager of the Mississippi. One distinguished writer has
given an absolute caricature of the race. My own design
has been, therefore, merely to throw before the reader
those characteristic traits which not even the most careless
observer could have failed to detect.

161 Though betraying but little of that fiery restlessness
which distinguishes the Parisian, these men are yet
Frenchmen in more respects than mere origin. In their
ordinary deportment we view, indeed, rather the calm
gravity, the saturnine severity of the Spaniard; and yet
in their fêtes and amusements, which were formerly far
more frequent than at present, they exhibit all the gayety
of the native of La Belle France. The calm, quiet tenour
of their lives presenting but few objects for enterprise,[Pg 53]
none for the strivings of ambition, and but little occasion
of any kind to elicit the loftier energies of our nature, has
imparted to their character, their feelings, their manners,
to the very language they speak, a languid softness
strongly contrasted by the unquiet restlessness of the emigrant
who is succeeding them. Hospitality was formerly,
with them, hardly a virtue: it was a matter of course, arising
from their peculiarity of situation; and the swinging
sign of the tavern is a recent usurpation. The statute-book,
the judiciary, courts of law, and the penitentiary,
were things little recognised among these simple-hearted
people; for where the inequalities of life were unknown,
what was the inducement to crime demanding this enginery
of punishment? Learning and science, too, were
terms scarcely comprehended, their technicalities not at
all; for schools were few, and learned men still more so;
and thus reading, writing, and ciphering are, and ever
have been, the acme of scholastic proficiency with the
French villager. How many of the honest fellows can
do even this, 162 is not for me to estimate. As to politics
and the affairs of the nation, which their countrymen
on the other side of the water ever seem to think no inconsiderable
object of their being, they are too tame, and too
lazy, and too quiet to think of the subject. Indeed, the
worthy villagers very wisely look upon "earthly dignities"
and the like much with the stoicism of Cardinal Wolsey
in disgrace,


"Oh, 'tis a burden, Cromwell, 'tis a burden,
Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven."


The virtues of these people are said to be many: punctuality
and honesty in their dealings; politeness and hospitality
to strangers; though, it must be confessed, the
manifold impositions practised upon their simplicity of
late years has tended to substitute for the latter virtue[Pg 54]
not a little of coolness and distrust. There is much
friendship and warmth of feeling between neighbours
and kindred, and the women make affectionate wives,
though by no means prone to consider themselves in
the light of goods and chattels of their liege-lords, as is
not unfrequently the case in more enlightened communities.
Indeed, as touching this matter, the Mississippi
French villager invariably reverses the sage maxim of the
poet,


"In things of moment on yourself depend;"


for he never presumes to depend upon any one but his
faithful helpmate, whether things are of moment or not.
As to religious faith, all are Catholics; and formerly, more
than of late years, were punctilious in observance of the
ceremony and discipline 163 of their church, permitting
but few festivals of the calendar to pass unobserved.
Their wealth consisted chiefly of personal property, slaves,
merchandise, etc.; land being deemed an item of secondary
consideration, while lead and peltry constituted the
ordinary circulating medium. Rent for houses was a thing
hardly known. All this changed long ago, of course;
and while real estate has augmented in value many hundred
per cent., personal property has somewhat proportionally
depreciated.

In the ordinary avocations of the villagers, there is but
little variety or distinction even at the present day, and
formerly this uniformity of pursuit was yet more observable.
The wealthier and more enterprising habitans were
traders, often with peculiar and exclusive privileges; and
they kept a heterogeneous stock of goods in the largest
room of their dwelling-houses, by way of being merchants.
There are but few who practice the mechanic arts for a
livelihood: carpenters, smiths, tailors, shoemakers, etc.,
as artisans, were formerly almost unknown, and there[Pg 55]
is now in this respect but little change. Now, as then,
the mass of the population are agriculturists, while many
of the young and enterprising men embrace with pride,
as offering a broad field for generous emulation, the occupations
of boatmen, traders to the Rocky Mountains       in
the vicinity of which most of their lives are passed       engagés
of the American Fur Company, or hunters
and trappers upon the prairies. The bold recklessness
of this class has long been notorious.

164 The idiom of these villages, though by no means
as pure as it might be, is yet much more so, all things considered,
than could be expected. It requires no very close
observation or proficiency in the language to detect a difference,
especially in pronunciation, from the European
French. There is not that nervous, animated brilliancy of
dialect which distinguishes the latter; and the nasal, lengthened,
drawling sound of words, gives their conversation a
languid, though by no means a disagreeable movement.
It is said to be more soft and euphonious than the vernacular,
though very different from the Creole dialect of the West
India Islands. There are some provincialisms, and some
words which a century ago might have been recognized
in some provinces of France, though not now.

As to the item of costume, it is still somewhat unique,
though formerly, we are told, much more so: that of the
men was a course blanket-coat, with a cap attached behind
in lieu of a cape; and which, from the circumstance
of drawing over the head, gave the garment the name of
capote. Around the head was wreathed a blue handkerchief
in place of a hat, and on the feet moccasins instead
of shoes and stockings. All this, however, has pretty
generally given place to the American garb, though some
of the very aged villagers may still be seen in their ancient
habiliments, the capote, moccasins, blue handkerchief on[Pg 56]
the head, and an endless queue lengthened out behind.
Their chief amusement ever has been, and, probably, ever
will be, the dance, in which all, even from the least to the
greatest, 165 bond and free, unite. Their slaves are
treated well, if we may judge from appearances; for nowhere
in the West have I seen a sleeker, fleshier, happier-looking
set of mortals than the blacks of these old villages.

Previous to the cession of Louisiana to our government,
the Laws of Spain were pretty generally in force
throughout the province, so far as related to municipal
arrangement and real estate, while the common law of
France       Coutume de Paris       governed all contracts of
a social nature, modified by and interwoven with the
customs of the people.[33] Each district had its commandant,
and each village its syndic, besides judges in civil
affairs for the province, and officers of the militia, a small
body of which was stationed in every district, though too
inconsiderable to afford much protection to the inhabitants.
These rulers were appointed by the governor at New-Orleans,
to whom there was an appeal; and the lieutenant-governor,
who resided at St. Louis, was commander of
the troops. Thus the government was a mixture of civil
and military; and, though arbitrary to the last degree,
yet we are told the rod of domination was so slight as
scarcely to be felt.[34] However this may be, it is pretty
certain they did not well relish at first the change in the[Pg 57]
administration of justice when they came under the jurisdiction
of our laws. The delay and uncertainty attendant
on trial by jury, and the multifarious technicalities of our
jurisprudence, they 166 could not well comprehend,
either as to import, importance, or utility; and it is not
strange they should have preferred the prompt despatch
of arbitrary power. Nor is the modern administration
of justice the only change with which the simple-hearted
villager is dissatisfied. On every side of him improvement,
the watchword of the age, is incessantly ringing in his ears;
and if there be one term in all our vocabulary he abhors
more than all others, it is this same: and, reader, there
is much wisdom in his folly. In 1811 the invention of
Fulton's mighty genius was first beheld walking upon
the Western waters; and from that hour "the occupation"
of the daring, reckless, chivalrous French voyageur "was
gone." Again the spirit of improvement declared that
the venerable old cottage, gray with a century's years, must
give place to the style and material of a more modern date;
and lo! the aged dwelling where his fathers lived, and
where his eyes opened on the light, is swept away, and its
very site is known no more. And then the streets and
thoroughfares where his boyhood has frolicked, as the
village increases to a city, must be widened, and straightened,
and paved, and all for no earthly reason, to his comprehension,
but to prevent familiar chat with his opposite
neighbour, when sitting on his balcony of a long summer
night, and to wear out his poor pony's unshodden hoofs!
It is very true that their landed property, where they have
managed to retain it from the iron grasp of speculation,
has increased in value almost beyond calculation by the
change; but they now refuse to 167 profit by selling.
Merchandise, the comforts and luxuries of life, have become
cheaper and more easily obtained, and the reward[Pg 58]
of industrious enterprise is greater. But what is all this
to men of their peculiar habits and feelings? Once they
were far better contented, even in comparative poverty.
There was then a harmony, and cordiality, and unanimity
of feeling pervading their society which it never can know
again. They were as one family in every village; nearly
all were connected either by ties of affinity, consanguinity,
propinquity, or friendship: distinction of rank or wealth
was little known, and individuals of every class were dressed
alike, and met upon equal and familiar footing in the same
ballroom. It is needless to say, that now "Nous avons
changé tout cela."[35]

As to the poorer class of these villagers, it is more than
doubtful whether they have at all been benefited by the
change of the past twenty years. We must not forget that,
as a race, they are peculiar in character, habits, and feeling;
and so utterly distinct from ourselves, that they can
with hardly more facility associate in customs with us
than can our red brother of the prairie. Formerly the
poorest, and the laziest, and the most reckless class was
fearless of want or beggary; but now a more enterprising
race has seized upon the lands with which they have imprudently
parted, perhaps with little remuneration, and
they find themselves abridged in many of their former
immunities. Their cattle may no longer range at will, nor
have they the liberty 168 of appropriating wood for fuel
wherever it seemeth good. It cannot be denied, that many
a one gains now a precarious subsistence, where formerly
he would have lived in comfort. Nearly every one possesses
a little cart, two or three diminutive ponies, a few
cattle, a cottage, and garden. But in agriculture, the[Pg 59]
superior industry of the new immigrant can afford them
for lease-rent double the result of their toil, while as draymen,
labourers, or workmen of any kind, it is not difficult
for foreigners to surpass them. In a few years the steamer
will have driven the keel-boat from the Western waters,
and with it the voyageur, the patron, and the courier du
bois; but the occupation of the hunter, trapper, and engagé,
in which the French villager can never be excelled, must
continue so long as the American Fur Company find it
profitable to deal in buffalo robes, or enterprising men
think proper to go to Santa Fé for gold dust. Nor will
the farmer, however lazy, lose the reward of his labour
so long as the market of St. Louis is as little overstocked
as at present. Nathless, it is pretty certain "times ain't
now as they used to was" to the French villager, all this
to the contrary notwithstanding.

In remarking upon the history of the French in the
West, and the peculiarities which still continue to characterize
them, I am aware I have lingered longer than
could have been anticipated; much longer, certainly,
than was my original intention. The circumstances which
have induced this delay have been somewhat various.
The subject itself is an interesting one. Apart from the[Pg 60]
delight we all experience in musing upon the events of
bygone time, and that gratification, so singularly exquisite,
of treading amid the scenes of "things departed,"
there is an interest which every individual who has cast
his lot in the great Valley cannot fail to feel in every item,
even the most minute, which may pertain to its history.
In dwelling, too, upon the features of "old Kaskaskia,"
my design has been to exemplify the distinguishing characteristics
of all these early settlements, both French and
Spanish, in the Valley of the Mississippi. The peculiarities
of all are the same, as were the circumstances 170
which first conduced to them. The same customs, the
same religion, the same amusements, and the same form
of government prevailed among all; and though dissimilar
in dialect, and separated by the broad Mississippi, yet,
cut off from all the rest of mankind, both the French and
the Spanish villagers were glad to smother differences,
and to bind themselves to each other in their dependant
situation by the tendrils of mutually kind offices and social
intercourse. Thus, several of the villages stand opposite
each other upon the banks of the Mississippi. Ste. Genevieve
is only across the stream from Kaskaskia, and many
fine old traditionary legends of these early times are yet
extant, and should be treasured up before too late.

But another circumstance which has been not unfavourable
to that prolixity into which I have suffered my
pen to glide, and without which other inducements might
have proved ineffectual, has been the quiet, dreamy seclusion
of this old hamlet, so congenial to the workings of the
brain. Yesterday was like to-day, and to-morrow will
be the transcript of yesterday; and so time's current slips
lazily along, like


"The liquid lapse of a murmuring stream."


As to objects of interest, one could hardly have lingered[Pg 61]
so long as I have within the precincts of this "sleepy hollow"
without having met with some incidents worthy of
regard for their novelty, if for naught else.

There are few situations in Illinois which can 171 boast
advantages for mercantile transaction superior to Kaskaskia.
But the villagers are not a commercial, enterprising,
money-making people, and the trade of the place
is, therefore, very small. The river is said to be navigable
for fifty miles from its mouth; the current is gentle, and
an inconsiderable expense in clearing the channel of fallen
timber would enable small boats to penetrate nearly two
hundred miles higher, by the meanderings of the stream,
to Vandalia. Measures for this purpose have been entered
upon. A land-office for the district is here established.[36]
The number of families is seventy or eighty,
nearly all French and all Catholics, besides considerable
transient population       boatmen, hunters, trappers, who
traverse the great rivers and broad prairies of the
valley.

Opposite Kaskaskia, on the summit of a lofty crag overlooking
the river, once stood a large fortress of massive
timber, named Fort Gage. Its form was an oblong quadrangle,
the exterior polygon being several hundred yards
in circumference. It was burnt to the ground in 1766.
About twelve years subsequent to this event, the place
was taken by the American troops under Colonel George
Rogers Clarke, "Hannibal of the West." After most
incredible exertions in the march from Virginia, he arrived
before Kaskaskia in the night; and, though fortified, so[Pg 62]
bewildering was the surprise of the villagers, that not a
blow was struck, and the town was taken.[37]

The aged Catholic church at Kaskaskia, among 172
other relics of the olden time, is well worthy a stranger's
visit. It was erected more than a century since upon
the ruins of a former structure of similar character, but
is still in decent condition, and the only church in the
place. It is a huge old pile, extremely awkward and ungainly,
with its projecting eaves, its walls of hewn timber
perpendicularly planted, and the interstices stuffed with
mortar, with its quaint, old-fashioned spire, and its dark,
storm-beaten casements. The interior of the edifice is
somewhat imposing, notwithstanding the sombre hue
of its walls; these are rudely plastered with lime, and decorated
with a few dingy paintings. The floor is of loose,
rough boards, and the ceiling arched with oaken panels.
The altar and the lamp suspended above are very antique,
I was informed by the officiating priest, having been used
in the former church. The lamp is a singular specimen
of superstition illustrated by the arts. But the structure
of the roof is the most remarkable feature of this venerable
edifice. This I discovered in a visit to the belfry of the
tower, accomplished at no little expenditure of sinew and
muscle, for stairs are an appliance quite unknown to this
primitive building. There are frames of two distinct
roofs, of massive workmanship, neatly united, comprising[Pg 63]
a vast number of rafters, buttresses, and braces, crossing
each other at every angle, and so ingeniously and
accurately arranged by the architect, that it is mathematically
impossible that any portion of the structure
shall sink until time with a single blow shall level the entire
173 edifice.[38] It is related, that when this church was
about being erected, the simple villagers, astonished at
the immense quantities of timber required for the frame,
called a meeting of the citizens, and for a time laid an
interdict upon operations, until inquiry respecting the
matter should be made. It was with difficulty the architect
at length obtained permission to proceed; but, when
all was completed, and the material had disappeared,
they knew not where, their astonishment surpassed all
bounds. The belfry reminded me of one of those ancient
monuments of the Druids called Rocking-stones; for though
it tottered to and fro beneath my weight, and always swings
with the bell when it is struck, perhaps the united force
of an hundred men could hardly hurl it from its seat. The
bell is consecrated by the crucifix cast in its surface, and
bears the inscription "Pour Leglise des Illinois. Normand
A. Parachelle, 1741." The view from this elevation
was extremely beautiful: the settlement scattered for miles
around, with the quaint little cottages and farms all smiling
in the merry sunlight, could hardly fail of the lovely
and picturesque. 174 The churchyard attached to the
building is not extensive, but crowded with tenants. It
is into this receptacle that for four generations Kaskaskia[Pg 64]
has poured her entire population. I saw but a few monuments
and a pile of stones. The first record on the register
belonging to this church is, I was informed by the priest,
to the following effect, in French: "1741, June 7. This
morning were brought to the fort three bodies from without,
killed by the Renards, to whom we gave sepulture." There
is here also a baptismal record, embracing the genealogies
of the French settlers since 1690, and other choice old
chronicles.[39] Some land deeds still remain extant, bearing
date as early as 1712, and a memorial also from the
villagers to Louis XV., dated 1725, petitioning a grant
of "commons," etc., in consequence of disasters from the
flood of the preceding year, in which their all had been
swept away, and they had been forced themselves to flee
for life to the bluffs opposite the village.

The Nunnery at Kaskaskia is a large wooden structure,
black with age, and formerly a public house. With this
institution is connected a female seminary, in high repute
throughout this region, and under superintendence of
ten of the sisters. A new nunnery of stone is about being
erected.[40]

It was a glorious morning, and, with many a lingering[Pg 65]
step, I left behind me the village of old Kaskaskia. As
I rode leisurely along the banks of that placid stream,
and among the beautiful farms of the French settlers, I
was more than once reminded forcibly of similar scenery
high up the Kennebeck, 175 in a distant section of Maine,
known by the name of "Indian Old Point," where I once
took a ramble with a college classmate during an autumn
vacation. The landscape is one of singular beauty; yet,
were it otherwise, there is a charm thrown around this
distant and lonely spot by its association with an interesting
passage in the earliest history of the country. In the
expressive language of an eloquent writer, who has made
the place the scene of an Indian tale, the soil is fertilized
by the blood of a murdered tribe. Here, one hundred years
ago, stood the village of the Norridgewocks, a tribe of
the powerful Abnaquis, who then held undisputed domination
over the extensive wilds of the far East. Though
possessing not the fierce valour of the Pequods, the sinewy
vigour of the Delawares, the serpent-like subtlety of the
Penobscots, the bell-toned idiom of the Iroquois, we are
yet told they were a powerful tribe for their intelligence
and their numbers. The Jesuit missionaries of Canada,
while at this era they were gliding upon the beautiful rivers
of the distant West, had not neglected the steril rocks of
the equally remote East: and the hamlet of the Norridgewocks
had early been subjected to the influences of the
fascinating ceremony and the lofty ritual of the Catholic
faith. Under the guidance of the devoted Sebastian Rasle,
a rude church was erected by the natives, and its gray,
cross-crowned spire reared up itself among the low-roofed
wigwams. Beloved by his savage flock, the venerable
Father Rasle lived on in peacefulness and quietude for
thirty years in the home of his adoption. During 176
the troubled period of the "French and Indian War"[Pg 66]
which ensued, suspicions arose that the Norridgewocks
were influenced by their missionary to many of their acts
of lawless violence upon a village of English settlers but
a few miles distant. In the autumn of 1724 this distrust
had augmented to a conviction that the Abnaquis had
resolved on the extermination of the white race, and a
detachment of soldiers ascended the Kennebeck. It was
a bright, beautiful morning of the Sabbath when they
approached the Indian hamlet. The sweet-toned bell
of the little chapel awoke the echoes with its clear peal,
and announced the hour of mass just as the early sunlight
was tinting the far-off hill-tops. A few moments,
and every living soul in the village was within the church,
and had bowed in humbleness before the "Great Spirit."
The deep tones of the venerable Rasle were supplicating,
"Ora, ora pro nobis," when the soldiers rushed in. Terrible
and indiscriminate was the massacre that ensued.
Not one was spared; not one! The pious Rasle poured
out his heart's blood upon the altar of his devotion. Those
of the natives who escaped from the chapel were either
shot down or perished miserably in the river, their bark
canoes having been previously perforated by the treachery
of their foes.[41] The drowsy beams of that day's setting[Pg 67]
sun dreamed beautifully as ever among the fragrant pine-tops
and the feathery hemlocks of the river-bank; but
his slanting rays smiled upon the ancient hamlet beneath[Pg 68]
177 whose ashes its exterminated dwellers were slumbering
the last sleep!

The grave of Father Rasle, a green mound overlooking
the stream, was pointed out to us. A granite obelisk
to his memory was erected by Bishop Fenwick, of Boston,
a few years since, but was demolished by a party of
miscreants soon after its completion. My object in this
lengthened episode upon the Norridgewocks, so casually
introduced, has been twofold: to illustrate the peaceful
policy of the French towards the Indian all over the continent,[Pg 69]
and to contrast it with that of other Europeans.

The ride from Kaskaskia to Prairie du Rocher in early
autumn is truly delightful. Crossing Aubuchon, formerly
called St. Philippe       a passage from the Mississippi to
the Kaskaskia, about four miles above the town, and
through which, in high floods, a rapid current passes from
one river to the other       the path lay through a tract of
astonishing fertility, where the wild fruit flourishes with
a luxuriance known to no other soil. Endless thickets
of the wild plum[42] and the blackberry, interlaced and
matted together by the young grape-vines streaming with
gorgeous clusters, were to be seen stretching for miles
along the plain. Such boundless profusion of wild fruit
I had never seen before. Vast groves of the ruby crab-apple,
the golden persimmon,[43] the black and white mulberry,[44]
and the wild cherry,[45] were 178 sprinkled with
their rainbow hues in isolated masses over the prairie,
or extended themselves in long luxurious streaks glowing
in the sun. The pawpaw,[46] too, with its luscious, pulpy
fruit; the peach, the pear, and the quince, all thrive in wild
luxuriance here; while of the nuts, the pecan or Choctaw
nut, the hickory, and the black walnut, are chief. As for
grapes, the indigenous vines are prolific; and the fruit
is said to be so excellent, that wine might be, and even
has been, made from them, and has been exported by
the early French in such quantities to France, that the
trade was prohibited lest the sale of a staple of that kingdom
should be injured! But all this is undoubtedly exaggeration,
if no more. Although the grape and the wine[Pg 70]
of southern Illinois have long been the theme of the traveller
through that delightful region, from the worthy Father
Hennepin, who tells us of the purple clusters lending their
rich hues to the gliding wave, to the tourist of the present
day, yet from personal observation I am confident they
are now by no means of much importance, and from good
authority am inclined to think they never were so. As
to the manufacture of wine becoming a matter interesting
to commerce, there is no probability of that. A kind of
liquor was formerly made in some quantities from what
is called the winter grape, common to the same latitude
in many portions of the United States, but it is said to have
been a very indifferent beverage. It was made in the
following simple manner: the clusters were heaped in
broad, shallow 179 vessels of wood, and, after being
crushed, the juice was expressed through perforations
for the purpose in the sides and bottom, by the application
of heavy weights, into vessels prepared for its reception.
Slight fermentation then completed the process.[47]

A ride of some hours through this delightful region
brought me to the bluffs, which, at this point extending
into the plain, confine the bottom to a narrow strip,
bounded on the one side by the Mississippi, and on the other
by the battlement of the cliffs, upward of an hundred
feet in height. Beneath lies the French village of Prairie
du Rocher, so called from its situation.[48] It is thirteen
miles from Kaskaskia, and its low cottages scattered along,
like the tents of a nomadic tribe, for miles, are completely
overhung by the huge, beetling crags above. From the
deep alluvion along the river's verge rises an enormous[Pg 71]
growth of cottonwood-trees and sycamores, concealing
the stream from the view. From the bluffs to this belt
of forest stretches away the vast common field, rustling
with maize. The castor-bean and tobacco-plant are also
often seen carpeting the ground with emerald. Around
each tenement, as usual, is a plat of cultivated land, and
the luxuriance of vegetation is unrivalled. Passing these
outskirts, I at length arrived at the body of the village,
lying upon a creek or bayou of the same name, which
winds through its centre, and empties into the Mississippi.
This quiet stream was once the scene of a very bloody
tragedy. When Illinois first came under territorial government,
and courts of civil judicature 180 were established,
the functionaries of the law, in passing one day
from Cahokia to Kaskaskia, to hold at the latter place
a session, stopped a few moments at this creek to water
their horses. The animals had scarcely begun to drink,
when a shower of balls from an adjoining thicket laid
three of the party weltering in their blood.[49] They had
neglected the usual precaution to disguise themselves in
the garb of the French villagers; and such was the hostility
of the Indian tribes, especially that of the Kickapoos,
to our countrymen at the time, that to travel in American
costume was almost inevitable death. The Indians at
that day had the ascendency in point of population, and
the Kaskaskia tribe, as well as others, was powerful.

At Prairie du Rocher, as everywhere else where these
ancient villages remain as yet undisturbed in their century
slumbers, the peculiarities to which I have so frequently
alluded stand forth to the traveller's eye. The narrow
lanes, the steep-roofed houses, the picketed enclosures,
the piazza, the peculiar dress, manners, and amusements[Pg 72]
of the villagers, all point back to a former age. At this
place I tarried for dinner, and while my olive-browed
hostess, a trim, buxom little matron, was "making ready,"
I strolled forth to the bluffs, having first received most
positive injunctions to make my reappearance when the
horn sounded; and, scrambling up a ravine, soon stood
upon the smooth round summit. The whole tract of country
over which my route had led was spread out like a map
before me; and the little village lay so directly at my feet
181 I could almost look down its chimneys. Among
the crags I obtained some fine petrifactions, which I exhibited
to my simple host, much to his astonishment, on
my return. Forty years had this man dwelt upon the very
spot he then inhabited, the scene of his birth; and almost
every day of his life had he ascended the cliffs among which
I had been clambering; and yet, though the seashells were
standing out in every direction from the surface of the
ledge, not the slightest peculiarity of structure had he ever
dreamed of. That the great ocean had rolled among these
rocks, he could have formed no conception. Experience
had told him that when burned they were lime, and he
neither knew nor cared to know anything farther of their
character or history. This slight incident well exemplifies
the simplicity of this singular people. Content to live
where his father lived; content to cultivate the spot he
tilled; to tread in the steps which he trod; to speak the
language he spake, and revere the faith he observed, the
French villager is a stranger to the restless cravings of
ambition, and acknowledges no inclination to change.
At Prairie du Rocher is a little, dark-looking, ancient
Catholic church, dedicated to St. Sulpice, formerly "Chapel
of Ease" to Fort Chartres, but at present it has no resident
priest. The population of the village is about two hundred.
Its site is low, and, buried as it is in such enormous[Pg 73]
vegetation, the spot must be unhealthy: yet, year after
year, and generation after generation, have its present
inhabitants continued to dwell where death almost inevitable
must have awaited an 182 American. But
where will you search for a fleshier, sleeker, swarthier-looking
race than these French villagers? Some attribute
this phenomenon to diet; some to natural idiosyncrasy;
and other some do not attribute at all, but merely stand
amazed. The truth of the matter is       and the fact is
one well ascertained       that, give a Frenchman a fiddle,
a pipe, a glass of claret, and room enough to shake his
heels, and, like a mushroom, he'll vegetate on any soil!

La Prairie du Rocher, Ill.




XXXVIII



"I have seen the walls of Balclutha, but they were desolate. The thistle shook
there its lonely head: the moss whistled to the wind. The fox looked out from
the windows; the rank grass of the wall waved round his head."       Ossian.


"We do love these ancient ruins:
We never tread upon them but we set
Our foot upon some reverend history."


To those of the present day who are in some degree
acquainted with the extent of the vast Western Valley,
it is not a little surprising to observe how inadequate the
conception with which, by its early proprietors, it was regarded,
and the singular measures which their mistaken
estimates originated. It is but within a very few years
that the extent and resources of this country have become
sufficiently developed to be at all appreciated. That the
French government was wholly unaware of its 183
true character in the cession of old Louisiana to Mr. Jefferson
in the early part of the present century, and that
our own people were at that time little less ignorant of
the same fact, need hardly be suggested to one acquainted[Pg 74]
with the diplomatic negotiations of the day, or with the
views and the feelings of the respective powers then
expressed.

But there are few circumstances which more definitely
betray the exceedingly inadequate idea entertained by
France respecting her possessions in North America,
than that early article of her policy, of uniting her Canadian
colonies, by a continuous chain of military posts,
with those upon the Gulf of Mexico. That any ministry
should seriously have entertained the idea of a line of
fortifications four thousand miles in extent, through a
waste, howling wilderness such as this valley then was,
and along the banks of streams such as the Ohio and Mississippi
yet continue to be; and that the design should
not only have been projected, but that measures should
actually have been entered upon for its accomplishment,
seems, at the present day, almost incredible. And yet,
from the very discovery of the country, was this scheme
designed, and ever afterward was steadily pursued by the
government of France. La Salle, in his last visit to Paris,
suggested the policy of a cordon of posts from the St. Lawrence
to the Gulf of Mexico, and urged the measure upon
Colbert as affording a complete line of defence to the
French settlements against those of the English along
the Atlantic shore. In furtherance of this design, he
sailed to establish a 184 colony at the mouth of the
Mississippi, in prosecution of which expedition he lost his
life. A line of fortifications was, however, commenced,
and gradually extended along the southern shore of Lake
Erie: one stood on the present site of the village of that
name; another between that point and the Ohio; a third
on the present site of Pittsburgh, named Du Quesne; a
fourth at the mouth of the Kentucky River; a fifth on the
south bank of the Ohio below; a sixth on the northern[Pg 75]
bank at the mouth of the Wabash; a seventh at the confluence
with the Mississippi; half a dozen others on the
latter stream below the junction, and several above upon
its banks and along those of the Illinois. Among these
last, and the most extensive of the fortifications then erected,
was Fort Chartres, long the most celebrated military
post in North America, now a pile of ruins.[50]

It was a beautiful afternoon, when, leaving the little
French hamlet La Prairie du Rocher, after a delightful
ride of three or four miles through rich groves of the persimmon,
the wild apple, and the Chickasaw plum,[51] I began
to believe myself not far from the ruins of this famous
old fort. Accosting a French villager whom I chanced
to meet, I inquired the site of the ruins. He turned on
me his glittering dark eye for a moment, and, pointing
away to the dense belt of forest upon the left in a direct
line with an enormous black-locust on the right of the
pathway, passed on. Not the slightest indication of the
object of my inquiry was to be 185 seen; but deeming
it fruitless to attempt gathering farther information from
the dark-browed villager, who was now some distance
on his way, I turned my horse's head from the path, and,
after labouring several rods through the deep, heavy grass
of the prairie, entered the wood. The dense undergrowth[Pg 76]
of bushes and matted vines was undisturbed, and there
was not an indication of visiters at the spot for months.
All seemed deserted, and silent, and drear. The ruins
were completely shrouded in foliage, and gigantic trees
were rearing their huge shafts from amid the crumbling
heaps of rubbish. Wild grape-vines and other parasites
were creeping in all directions over the trembling structures;
or, drooping forth in pensile gracefulness from the
disjointed walls, seemed striving to bind up the shattered
fragments, and to conceal the pitiless ravage of time. The
effect of this noble old pile of architecture, reposing thus
in ruins, and shrouded in the cathedral duskiness of the
forest, was singularly solemn.


"The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,
O'ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe.
Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds
Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven."


Securing my horse to the trunk of a young sapling rearing
up itself beneath the walls, I at length succeeded,
by dint of struggling through the rough thickets and the
enormous vegetation, in placing myself at a point from
which most of the ruins could be taken at a coup d'      il.
Some portions of the exterior wall are yet in good preservation,
and 186 the whole line of fortification may be
easily traced out; but all the structures within the quadrangle
are quite dilapidated, and trees of a large size are
springing from the ruins: an extensive powder-magazine,
however, in a gorge of one of the bastions, yet retains its
original form and solidity. The western angle of the
fort and an entire bastion was, about fifty years since,
undermined and thrown down by a slough from the Mississippi;
but the channel is now changed, and is yearly
receding, while a young belt of trees has sprung up between
the ruins and the water's edge. The prairie in[Pg 77]
front of the fort was in cultivation not many years since,
and was celebrated for its blue grass.

Fort Chartres was erected by the French in 1720, as
a link in the chain of posts which I have mentioned, uniting
New-Orleans with Quebec; and as a defence for the
neighbouring villages against the Spaniards, who were
then taking possession of the country on the opposite side
of the Mississippi, as well as against the incursion of hostile
Indian tribes. The expense of its erection is said to
have been enormous, and it was considered the strongest
fortification in North America. The material was brought
from the bluffs, some four or five miles distant over the
bottom by boats across a considerable intervening sheet
of water, and from the opposite side of the Mississippi.
In 1756 it was rebuilt; and in 1763, when France ceded
her possessions east of the Mississippi to England, the
adjoining village embraced about forty families, and a
church dedicated to St. Anne.[52] 187 When the English
troops took possession of the country, the villagers all
removed to the hamlets across the river, then under the
French government, having been previously ceded, in
the treaty of St. Ildefonso, by Spain to France. The
fort was not evacuated, however, until July, 1765, when
its commandant, M. de St. Ange de belle rive, proceeded
to St. Louis with his forces.[53]

[Pg 78]

While Fort Chartres belonged to France, it was the
seat of government for all the neighbouring region; and
in 1765, when taken possession of by Captain Sterling,
of the Royal Highlanders, it continued to retain its arbitrary
character. It was here that the first court of justice,
established by Lieutenant-colonel Wilkins, held its sessions.[54]
Seven judges were appointed, who came together[Pg 79]
monthly at the fortress; but their decisions were very ill
received by a people who, until then, had been released
from all but arbitrary restriction.[55]

The original form of Fort Chartres was an irregular
quadrangle, with four bastions; the sides of the exterior[Pg 80]
polygon being about five hundred feet in extent. The
ditch and scarp were commenced, but left uncompleted.
The walls, massively constructed of stone, and stuccoed
with lime, were upward of two feet in thickness and fifteen
feet in height. They still retain this altitude in some portions
which are uninjured; and many of the loopholes
and the ports for cannon, in the face of the wall and in the[Pg 81]
flanks of the bastions, are yet to be seen entire. The
elegantly dressed freestone, however, which 188 was
employed about them, as well as for the cornices and
casements of the gate and buildings, has long since been
removed. Specimens are to be seen incorporated in some[Pg 82]
of the elegant structures which have since gone up in the
neighbouring city.[58]

The military engineering of the early French fortifications
in North America was of the school of Vauban; and
the massive structures then erected are now monuments,
not less of the skill of their founders than of departed time.
The almost indestructible character of their masonry
has long been a subject of surprise. The walls of Fort
Chartres, though half a century has seen them abandoned
to the ravages of the elements and of time, yet remain
so imperishable, that in some instances it is not easy
to distinguish the limestone from the cement; and the
neighbouring villagers, in removing the materials for the
purposes of building, have found it almost impossible
to separate them one from the other.

The buildings which occupied the square area of Fort
Chartres were of the same massive masonry as the walls.
They consisted of a commandant's and commissary's
residence, both noble structures of stone, and of equal size:
two extensive lines of barracks, the magazine of stores,
with vaulted cellars, and the corps de guarde. Within the
gorges of the eastern bastions were the powder-magazine
and a bakehouse; in the western, a prison, with dungeons
and some smaller buildings. There were two sally-ports
to the fortification in the middle of opposite faces of the
wall; and a broad avenue passed from one to the other,
directly through the square, 189 along the sides of which
were ranged the buildings. A small banquette a few feet
in height ran parallel to the loopholes, for the purpose of
elevating the troops when discharging musketry at an
enemy without.
[Pg 83]
Such was Fort Chartres in the pride of its early prime;
the seat of power, festivity, and taste; the gathering-spot
of all the rank, and beauty, and fashion the province could
then boast. Many a time, doubtless, have the walls of
this stern old citadel rung to the note of revelry; and the
light, twinkling footstep of the dark-eyed creole has beat
in unison with a heart throbbing in fuller gush from the
presence of the young, martial figure at her side! Fort
Chartres, in its early years, was doubtless not more the
headquarters of arbitration and rule than of gentility
and etiquette. The settlers of the early French villages,
though many of them indigent, were not all of them rude
and illiterate. Induced by anticipations of untold wealth,
such as had crowned the adventurers of Spain in the southern
section of the Western Continent, grants and charters
of immense tracts of territory in these remote regions had
been made by the crown of France to responsible individuals;
and thus the leaders in these golden enterprises were generally
gentlemen of education and talent, whose manners
had been formed within the precincts of St. Cloud, then
the most elegant court in Europe. Many of these enthusiastic
adventurers, it is true, returned to France in
disappointment and disgust; and many of them removed
to the more genial latitude of Lower Louisiana: 190 yet a
few, astonished at the fertility and extent of a country of
which they had never dreamed before; delighted with the
variety and delicacy of its fruits, and reminded by the mildness
of the climate of the sweetest portions of their own
beautiful France, preferred to remain. By the present
degenerate race of villagers, those early days are referred
to as a "golden age" in their history, and the "old
residenters" as wonderful beings. Consider the singular
situation of these men       a thousand miles from the
Atlantic shores, surrounded by savages and by their own[Pg 84]
countrymen scarce less ignorant, and separated by pathless
mountains from a community of civilized man. The higher
stations in the French army were at that era, too, more
than at present, occupied by men of genius and information,
while the Catholic priesthood was equally distinguished
for literary attainment. Under circumstances like these,
was it other than natural that reciprocity of feeling and
congeniality of taste should have sought their gratification
by mutual and frequent intercourse? Fort Chartres must,
therefore, have been the seat of hospitality, religious celebration,
and kindly feeling. Here the fleshy old habitans
of the neighbouring villages dozed away many an hour
of sober jovialness with their "droughty cronies" over
the pipe and the claret of their own vineyards; while their
dark-haired daughters tripped away on the green sward
before them in the balmy moonlit summer eve with the
graceful officers of the fortress.

Here, too, has been witnessed something of "the pride,
and pomp, and circumstance of glorious war." 191 The
fleur-de-lis of the Fifteenth Louis has rolled out its heavy
folds above these stern old towers; the crimson Lion of
England has succeeded; and the stripes and stars of our
own republic have floated over both in triumph. The
morning gun of the fortress has boomed across the broad
prairie, and been reverberated from yonder cliffs: the merry
reveille has rose upon the early breeze, and wakened the
slumbering echoes of the forest; and the evening bugle
from the walls has wailed its long-drawn, melancholy
note along those sunset waters of the Eternal River!

Such, I repeat, was Fort Chartres in its better days,
but such is Fort Chartres no more. I lingered for hours
with saddened interest around the old ruins, until the
long misty beams of the setting sun, streaming through
the forest, reminded me that I had not yet secured a shelter[Pg 85]
for the coming night. Remounting my horse, I left
the spot at a brisk pace, and a ride of a few miles brought
me to a dwelling situated upon a mound somewhat elevated
from the low, flat bottom-land around, about one mile from
the Mississippi, and commanding a view of the distant
lake and bluffs to the north. Here, then, I affix the name
by which is known all the surrounding region.

Fort Chartres, Ill.




XXXIX


"I know not how the truth may be,
I tell the tale as told to me."



"Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war."
Othello.



Fort Chartres has already detained me longer than
was my design. My pen has been unconsciously led on
from item to item, and from one topic to another; and
now, in leaving this celebrated fortress, I cannot forbear
alluding to a few incidents connected with its origin
and early history, which have casually presented themselves
to my notice. Selection is made from many of a similar
character, which at another time and in a different form
may employ the writer's pen. The conclusion of my
last number attempted a description of the spot from
which it was dated; and, reader, a beautiful spot it was,
beneath the soft, gentle radiance of a summer evening.
Not soon, I ween, shall I forget the wild romance of that
moonlit scene as I reclined upon the gray old bench at
the door of the farmhouse after the evening meal was
over, and listened to the singular events of which that
region had been the theatre in other days. More than
forty years had seen mine host a resident of the spot,
and no one, with diligence more exemplary 193 than his[Pg 86]
own, had gathered up the curious legends of the place,
many of them from aged men who had themselves been
witnesses of the events they chronicled. By these traditions,
whatever may be our inclination to yield them credence
at this late period, the origin and history of the
fortification of Fort Chartres is by no means devoid of
interest. In 1720, when it was resolved on by the crown
of France to erect a fortress at this point upon the Mississippi,
in continuation of her line of posts uniting Quebec
with New-Orleans, and for the defence of her colonies,
a military engineer of the school of the celebrated Sebastian
Vauban was sent over to project and accomplish the design.[59]
To his own discretion, within prescribed limits       so
goes the story       was confided the whole undertaking.
Far and wide throughout the province resounded
the note of preparation. The peaceful villager was summoned
from his pipe and his plough; the din of steel and
stone broke in upon the solitudes; and at length, at the
enormous expenditure of nine millions of livres, arose
Fort Chartres; and its battlements frowned over the forests
and cast their shadows along the waters of the Eternal
River! The work was completed, and fondly believed
its architect that he had reared for his memory a monument
for the generations of coming time. A powerful
battery of iron ordnance protruded from the ports, and
every department of the fortress was supplied with the
most extensive munitions of war. A large number of
cannon for many years were laying beneath the walls
of the fort, in the early part 194 of the present century,
buried in matted vines and underbrush. The fortress
was completed, and the silver lilies floated over the walls;
but the engineer had far exceeded the limits prescribed
in erecting a work of such massive and needless strength,[Pg 87]
and a missive royal summoned him to St. Cloud. The
miserable man, aware that little was to be hoped from
the clemency of the warlike Louis XV., poisoned himself
upon arriving in his native land, to escape the indignation
of his sovereign. Previously, however, to his departure
for France, immense sums in gold for defraying the
expenses of the fortress had been forwarded him to
New Orleans and sent up the river, but, owing to his
subsequent arrest, were never distributed to the labourers.
Tradition averreth these vast treasures to have been buried
beneath the foundations of the fort. However the truth
may be, the number of those who have believed and searched
has not been inconsiderable: but unhappily, as is ever the
case with these "hidden treasures," the light has gone
out just at the critical moment, or some luckless wight,
in his zeal, has thought proper to speak just as the barrel
of money has been struck by the mattock, or some other
untoward event has occurred to dissolve the charm of the
witch-hazel, and to stir up the wrath of those notable
spirits which are always known to stand guard over buried
gold! And thus has it happened that the treasure yet reposes
in primeval peace; and the big family Bible, always
conveyed to the spot on such inquisitorial occasions, has
alone prevented consequences most 195 fatal! Whether
the good people of the vicinity in the present unbelieving
generation have faith to dig, I know not; but, when I visited
the spot, the earth of the powder-magazine to which I have
alluded exhibited marvellous indication of having been
disturbed at no distant period previous. So much for
the origin of Fort Chartres. The story may be true, it
may not. At all events, it will be remembered I do not
endorse it.

There is also a tradition yet extant of a stratagem of
war by which Fort Chartres was once captured, worthy[Pg 88]
the genius of Fabius Maximus, and partaking, moreover,
somewhat of history in character. The name of
George Rogers Clarke is familiar to every one who can
claim even indifferent acquaintance with the early border
warfare of the West. This extraordinary man, having
satisfied himself, like Hannibal of Carthage, that the only
way decisively to conquer a crafty and powerful foe was
by carrying the war to his own altars and hearths, placed
himself at the head of a few hundred of the Virginia militia
in 1778, and set forth upon one of the most daring enterprises
ever chronicled on the page of military history       the
celebrated expedition against the distant post of Fort
Vincent, now Vincennes. Our country was then at war
with Great Britain, and this fort, together with those upon
the lakes and the Mississippi, were in possession of the
enemy and their savage allies. Colonel Clarke crossed
the mountains with his little band; descended the Monongahela
and the Ohio to within sixty miles of the mouth
of 196 the latter, and there concealing his boats, he
plunged with his followers through swamps, and creeks,
and marshes almost impassable, a distance of one hundred
and thirty miles, and in a space of time incredibly short,
arrived at night opposite the village of Kaskaskia. So
overwhelming was the surprise, that the town, though
fortified, was taken without a blow. History goes on to
tell us that a detachment of troops, mounted on the horses
of the country, was immediately pushed forward to surprise
the villages of Fort Chartres and Cahokia, higher
up the Mississippi; and that they were all taken without
resistance, and the British power in that quarter completely
destroyed.[60] So much for History, now for Tradition.[Pg 89]
When the little band arrived beneath the walls of Fort
Chartres, the numbers of the garrison far exceeding those
of the besiegers, the latter, as if in despair of success, shortly
took up the line of march and disappeared behind the
distant bluffs. Days passed on; diligent examination
of the heights was kept up with glasses from the walls,
but no enemy returned. At length, when apprehension
had begun to die away, early one morning a troop of
cavalry appeared winding over the bluffs, their arms
glittering in the sunlight, and descended from view apparently
into the plain beneath. Hour after hour the march
continued; troop after troop, battalion upon battalion,
regiment after regiment, with their various ensigns and
habiliments of warfare, appeared in lengthened files,
wound over the bluffs, and disappeared. Alarmed 197
and astonished at the countless swarms of the invaders, the
garrison hastily evacuated the fortress, and for dear life
and liberty, soon placed the broad Mississippi between
themselves and the cloud of locusts! Hardly was this
precipitate man      uvre well accomplished, when the alarum
of drum and fife was heard, and the identical force which
but a few days before had raised the siege, and in despair
had retreated from beneath the walls, now paraded through
the open sally-ports, their rags and tatters fluttering by
way of "pomp and circumstance" in the evening breeze.
This fortunate ruse du guerre had been accomplished
through the favourable nature of the ground, a few extra
stand of colours manufactured for the occasion, and a
variety of uniforms and arms of like character. After
winding over the bluffs into the plain beneath, they again[Pg 90]
ascended through a defile unobserved by the garrison,
and once more appeared in different guise and order in
rear of their comrades. "Distance," too, cast doubtless
not a little "enchantment" over "the view;" and then the
fear and trepidation of the worthy garrison probably
sharpened their optics to detect all the peril in store
for them, and, perchance, somewhat more. Now, reader,
you can do as you choose touching belief of all this. And
while you are making up a decision on the point, permit
me to furnish yet another scrap of History, which may,
peradventure, assist.

For sixteen days was Col. Clarke employed in his march
from Kaskaskia to Vincennes, after the 198 capture
of the military posts upon the Mississippi. At length,
after toils incredible, he reached the Wabash. High
upon the eastern bank, its base swept by the rolling flood,
stood Fort Vincent, the British fortress, at that period
garrisoned by a superior corps of soldiery, with an auxiliary
force of six hundred Indian warriors, and under
the command of a skilful officer, Gov. Hamilton. On the
western bank was spread out a broad sheet of alluvion five
miles in breadth, completely inundated by the swollen
stream. After five days of toil this wilderness of waters
was passed; the rolling current of the Wabash was crossed
in the night, and the morning sun beheld these daring
men before Vincennes. As they approached the town       history
goes on to relate       over the broad and beautiful
prairie upon which it stands, at the moment his troops
were discovered by the enemy, Clarke found himself near
a small ancient mound, which concealed part of his force
from the foe. Under this covert he countermarched his
men in so skilful a manner, that the leading files, which
had been seen from the town, were transferred undiscovered
to the rear, and made to pass again and again in[Pg 91]
sight of the enemy, until his whole force had several times
been displayed, and his little detachment of jaded troops
assumed the appearance of an extended column greatly
superior to its actual strength. The garrison was promptly
summoned to surrender, and, after a brief defence, Gov.
Hamilton struck his flag to a body of men not half as
powerful as his own.[61]

199 Next in importance to Fort Chartres, of that chain
of military posts commenced by the French in the Valley
of the Mississippi, was Fort du Quesne;[62] and of this
celebrated fortress, so notorious in the bloody annals of
border warfare, it may not be irrelevant, in concluding
the present subject, to add a few sentences. This post
was erected on that low tongue of land, at the head of the
Ohio and confluence of the Alleghany and Monongahela
rivers, where Pittsburgh now stands, commanded on all
sides by lofty bluffs. It was built by M. de la Jonquier,
at command of the Marquis du Quesne, governor of
Canada. In 1754 the bold Contrec      ur came down the
Alleghany, with a thousand Frenchmen in canoes, and
eighteen pieces of artillery; and, dispersing the small colonial
force, intrenched himself upon the spot. This was the
prologue to that bloody drama, the catastrophe of which
deprived France of all her possessions east of the Mississippi.
In 1758 Fort du Quesne was taken by Gen. Forbes;
a more scientific and extensive fortress was erected on
the spot, at an expense of sixty thousand pounds sterling,[Pg 92]
and, in honour of William Pitt, then Premier of England,
named Fort Pitt. It is difficult to conceive what could have
been the design of these commanders in erecting such
a massive fortress on such a spot, unless to impress the
minds of their savage but simple neighbours; for resistance
to artillery planted upon the neighbouring heights would
have been quite as vain as any attack of the Indians upon
its walls with their primitive weapons. The same may
be said of 200 nearly all the early fortifications in the
West, and of some of more modern date upon our frontier.
Subsequently Fort Pitt came into the possession of our
government as part of the estate of the Penn family, and
is now only a heap of rubbish. Thus much for early
military posts in the Valley of the Mississippi.

So deeply interested was I in listening to the "legendary
lore" associated with the spot upon which I was sitting,
that hours glided unobserved away, and the full moon
was culminating in cloudless splendour from the zenith
when we retired.

Early the following morning I was in the saddle. The
heavy night-mists lay wavering, like a silvery mantle,
all over the surface of that broad plain; and the crimson
clouds, rolling up the eastern sky, proclaimed the rising
sun. After a short ride I reached the former site of St.
Philippe, a settlement of the French, since called Little
Village. Its "common field" is now comprised in the
single plantation of Mr. M'David. It was at this point
that Philippe Francis Renault       from whom the village
received its name, as well as a large section of the neighbouring
region, known to this day as "Renault's Tract"       established
himself in 1719, with two hundred miners
from France, in anticipation of discovering gold and silver.[Pg 93][63]
He was disappointed; but is said to have obtained large
quantities of lead from the region along the opposite bank
of the Mississippi, in the vicinity of Ste. Genevieve; and
to have discovered, moreover, a copper mine near Peoria.
St. Philippe was once a considerable village. Previous
to 1765       when possession of the country was claimed
201 by the English government, and, like the other
French settlements, it was abandoned by the villagers       it
is said to have comprised twenty or thirty families,
a Catholic church, and a water-mill; while the surrounding
meadow afforded pasturage for extensive herds of
cattle.

Leaving St. Philippe, the winding pathway in a few
miles had conducted me into the depths of a forest of
gigantic cotton-trees upon the left, encircled by enormous
grape-vines, and the ground beneath entangled by a wilderness
of underbrush and thickets of wild fruit. In a few
moments the forest opened unexpectedly before me, and
at my feet rolled on the turbid floods of the Mississippi,
beyond which went up the towering cliffs of limestone,
hoar and ragged, to the sheer height of some hundred feet
from the water's edge. They were the cliffs of Herculaneum,
with their shot-towers.[64] For the first time I discovered
that I had mistaken my way. Perceiving the low
log-cabin of a woodcutter among the trees, I had soon
obtained the requisite information, and was retracing
my steps; but a weary plod through the deep black[Pg 94]
loam, and the tall grass weltering in the night-dews, and
the thickets of the dripping meadows, was anything but
agreeable. There were but few farms along my route,
and the tenants of those with whom I chanced to meet
betrayed too plainly, by their ghastly visages, and their
withered, ague-racked limbs, the deadly influences of the
atmosphere they inhaled. As I wandered through this
region, where vegetation, towering in all its rank 202 and
monstrous forms, gave evidence of a soil too unnaturally
fertile for culture by man, whose bread must be bought
by "the sweat of his brow," I thought I could perceive
a deadly nausea stealing over my frame, and that every
respiration was a draught of the floating pestilence. I
urged onward my horse, as if by flight to leave behind me
the fatal contagion which seemed hovering on every side;
as if to burst through the poisonous vapours which seemed
distilling from every giant upas along my path. That
this region should be subject to disease and death is a
circumstance by no means singular. Indeed, it seems
only unaccountable to the traveller that it may be inhabited
at all. A soil of such astonishing depth and fertility,
veiled from the purifying influences of the sun by the
rank luxuriance of its vegetation, in the stifling sultriness
of midsummer sends forth vast quantities of mephitic
vapour fatal to life; while the decay of the enormous vegetables
poisons the atmosphere with putrid exhalations.
Cultivation and settlement will, of course, as in the older
states, remedy this evil to some extent in time. It is said
that the southern border of a lake in this region is less
unhealthy than the northern, on account of the prevalence
of winds from the former quarter during the summer
months; and that the immediate margin of a river, though
buried in vegetation, is less liable to disease than the neighbouring
bluffs, upon which hang the night and morning[Pg 95]
vapours. A dry and somewhat elevated spot is preferable
to either for a cabin; and it should be well ventilated, and
never closely surrounded by 203 cornfields. The rank
and massive foliage shields the earth from the sunbeams,
which exhale its poisonous damps; and in its rapid growth,
the plant abstracts from the surrounding atmosphere one
of its vital ingredients. Indeed, most of the diseases
peculiar to the West are superinduced by imprudence,
ignorance, or negligence in nursing. Let the recent emigrant
avoid the chill, heavy night-dews and the sickening
sultriness of the noontide sun; provide a close dwelling,
well situated and ventilated, and invariably wear thicker
clothing at night than in the day, and he may live on as
long and as healthily in the West as in his native village.
Bilious intermittents are the most prevalent and fatal
diseases in the sickly months of August, September, and
October; and in the winter and spring pleurisies are frequent.
The genuine phthisic, or pulmonary consumption
of New-England, is rarely met. A mysterious disease,
called the "milk sickness"       because it was supposed to
be communicated by that liquid       was once alarmingly
prevalent in certain isolated districts of Illinois.[65] Whole
villages were depopulated; and though the mystery was
often and thoroughly investigated, the cause of the disease
was never discovered. By some it was ascribed to the
milk or to the flesh of cows feeding upon a certain unknown
poisonous plant, found only in certain districts; by others,
to certain springs of water, or to the exhalations of certain[Pg 96]
marshes. The mystery attending its operations and its
terrible fatality at one period created a perfect panic in
the settlers; nor was this at all wonderful. The disease
appears 204 now to be vanishing. But, of all other
epidemics, the "fever and ague" is the scourge of the
West. Not that it often terminates fatally, except by
superinducing a species of consumption; but, when severe
and protracted, it completely shatters the constitution;
and, like Mezentius, the victim ever after bears about him
a living death. In its lighter form, most of the settlers
at some time or other experience it, as it is brought on by
exposure: and when I consider that, during my ramble
in the West, I have subjected myself to every variety of
climate and circumstance; have been drenched by night-dews
and morning-dews; by the vapours of marshes and
forests, and by the torrents of summer showers; have
wandered day after day over the endless prairies beneath
a scorching sun, and at its close have laid myself anywhere
or nowhere to rest; when I consider this, I cannot
but wonder at the escape of a constitution naturally feeble
from complete prostration. Yet never was it more vigorous
than during this tour on the prairies.

At length, after a ride which seemed interminable, I
found myself at the foot of the bluffs; and, drawing up my
horse, applied at a cabin attached to an extensive farm for[Pg 97]
refreshment. A farmer of respectable garb and mien came
tottering towards the gateway; and, to my request, informed
me that every individual of his family was ill of the "fever
and ague." I inquired for the state of his own health,
remarking his shattered appearance. "Yes, I am shattered,"
he replied, leaning heavily against the rails for support;
"the agues and fevers have terribly 205 racked me; but
I am better, I am better now." Ah, thought I, as, returning
his kind good-morning, I resumed my route, you think,
poor man, that health will revisit your shattered frame;
but that pallidness of brow, and those sunken temples,
tell me that you must die. Consumption's funeral fires
were already kindling up in the depths of his piercing eye.
At the next cabin, where I was so fortunate as to succeed
in obtaining refreshment, I was informed that the poor
fellow was in the last stages of a decline brought on by
undue exposure to the chill, poisonous night-dews of the
bottom. The individual from whom this information
was received was himself far from enjoying uninterrupted
health, though thirty-five years had seen him a tenant of
the spot upon which I met him.

"'Tis many moons ago       a long       long time."

The Seasons.



In the course of my journeying in the regions of the
"Far West," it has more than once chanced to me to
encounter individuals of that singular class commonly[Pg 98]
termed "Squatters;" those sturdy pioneers who formed the
earliest American settlements along our western frontier.
And, in my casual intercourse with them, I have remarked,
with not a little surprise, a decision of character, an acuteness
of penetration, and a depth and originality of thought
betrayed in their observations, strangely enough contrasting
with the rude solitude of their life. For more than
half a century, mayhap, Nature


"Had been to them a more familiar face
Than that of man;"


and whether, in the present exhibition of intellectual energy,
we are to claim an argument for the influence of natural
scenery upon character, or may find a corroboration of
the theory of diversity of mental ability; or to whatever
circumstance it may be attributed, 207 very assuredly
it owes not its origin to the improvements of education
or the advantages of society. There is also remarked in
these rude men a susceptibility and refinement of feeling,
and a delicacy of sentiment, which one would suppose
hardly compatible with a protracted continuance of their
semi-savage life.

It was at the frugal, though well-spread board of an
individual of this class that I was pleased to find myself
seated, after my tedious morning ramble of several hours
through the weltering vegetation of the prairie. Mine
host was a man of apparently forty, though in reality some
eight or ten years in advance of that age: his form, of
medium stature, was symmetrical, erect, and closely knit,
betraying considerable capability of endurance, though
but little of muscular strength: his countenance, at first
sight, was by no means prepossessing; indeed, the features,
while in repose, presented an aspect harsh       almost forbidding;
but, when lighted up by animation, there was
discoverable in their rapid play a mildness which well[Pg 99]
compared with the benevolent expression of a soft blue
eye. Such was the physique of my backwoods pioneer,
who for forty years had been a wanderer on the outskirts
of civilization, and had at length been overtaken by its
rapid march.

As I had before me but an easy ride for the day, I proposed
to mine host, when our repast was over, that he
should accompany me to the summit of the range of bluffs
which rose behind his cabin, towering to the height of
several hundred feet above the roof. To this he readily
assented, and well did 208 the magnificent view commanded
from the top compensate for the toil of the ascent.
The scene was grand. "Yonder," said my companion,
seating himself on the earth at my side, and stretching out
his arm to the southeast, "yonder lies the village of old
Kaskaskia, with the bluffs of the river beyond, rising
against the sky; while a little to the left you catch the white
cliffs of Prairie du Rocher. In that heavy timber to the
south are the ruins of Fort Chartres, and to the right, across
the lake, fifty years ago stood St. Philippe. The Mississippi
is concealed from us, but its windings can be traced
by the irregular strip of forest which skirts its margin.
Beyond the stream, stretching away to the northwest,
the range of heights you view are the celebrated cornice-cliffs[66]
above Herculaneum; and at intervals you catch
a glimpse of a shot-tower, resting like a cloud against the
sky, upon the tallest pinnacles. The plain at our feet,
which is now sprinkled with cornfields, was once the site
of an Indian village. Forty years ago, the ruins of the
wigwams and the dancing circle surrounding the war-post
could be distinctly traced out: and even now my
ploughshare every spring turns up articles of pottery[Pg 100]
which constituted their domestic utensils, together with
axes and mallets of stone, spear and arrow heads and
knives of flint, and all their rude instruments of war. Often
of a fine evening," continued my companion, after a pause,
"when my work for the day is over, and the sun is going
down 209 in the west, I climb up to this spot and look
out over this grand prospect; and it almost makes me sad
to think how the tribes that once possessed this beautiful
region have faded away. Nearly forty years ago, when
I came with my father from old Virginia, this whole state,
with its prairies, and forests, and rich bottoms, was the
hunting-ground of the Indians. On this spot we built
our cabin; and though I have since lived far off on the
outskirts of the Missouri frontier, I always had an affection
for this old bottom and these bluffs, and have come back
to spend here the rest of my days. But the Indians are
gone. The round top of every bluff in yonder range is
the grave of an Indian chief."

While my singular companion was making these observations,
somewhat in the language I have attempted to
give, interrupted from time to time by my inquiries, I
had myself been abstractedly employed in thrusting a
knife which was in my hand into the yielding mould of
the mound upon which we sat, when, suddenly, the blade,
striking upon a substance somewhat harder than the soil,
snapped into fragments. Hastily scraping away the loose
mould to the depth of some inches, the femur of a human
skeleton protruding from the soil was disinterred, and,
in a few minutes, with the aid of my companion, the remnants
of an entire skeleton were laid bare. Compared
with our own limbs, the bones seemed of a size almost
gigantic; and from this circumstance, if from no other,
it was evident that our melancholy moralizing upon the
destinies of the Indians had been indulged upon a very[Pg 101]
fitting spot       210 the grave of one of its chieftains.
Originally, the body had no doubt been covered to the
depth of many feet, and the shallowness of soil at the present
time indicates a lapse of centuries. Still these graves
of the bluffs, which doubtless belonged to the ancestors
of the present aborigines, will neither be confounded nor
compared with the gigantic earth-heaps of the prairies.
Strangely enough, this has been the case, though a moment's
reflection must convince one that they are the monuments
of a far later race.

Descending the bluffs by an ancient path in a ravine,
said to have been made in conveying oak timber to Fort
Chartres at the period of its erection, my host conducted
me into one of the enclosures of his farm, a spot which
had evidently once been the ordinary burial-place of the
ancient Indian village. Graves, sufficient, apparently, for
hundreds of individuals, were yet to be seen upon every
side. They were arranged parallel to each other in uniform
ranges, and were each formed by a rough slab of limestone
upon either side, and two at the extremities, terminating
in an obtuse angle. From several of these old
sepulchres we threw out the sand, and, at the depth of
about four feet, exhumed fragments of human remains
in various stages of preservation, deposited upon a broad
slab of limestone at the bottom. When taken together,
these slabs form a complete coffin of stone, in which the
body originally reposed; and this arrangement, with
the silicious nature of the soil, has probably preserved the
remains a longer period than would otherwise have been
the case. But the circumstance respecting 211 these
ancient graves which chiefly excited my astonishment
was their marvellous littleness, none of them exceeding
a length of four feet; and the wondrous tales of a "pigmy
race of aborigines" once inhabiting the West, which I[Pg 102]
had often listened to, recurred with considerable force to
my memory. Resolved to decide this long-mooted question
to my own satisfaction, if possible, the earth from
one of the graves, the most perfect to be found, was excavated
with care, and upon the bottom were discovered
the femur and tibia of a skeleton in a state of tolerable
preservation, being parallel to each other and in immediate
proximity. Proof incontestible, this, that the remains
were those of no Lilliputian race four feet in stature, and
affording a fair presumption that the limbs were forcibly
bent in this position at the time of burial, occupying their
stone coffin much as the subject for scientific dissection
occupies a beef-barrel. In this manner may we satisfactorily
account for the ancient "pigmy cemetery" near
the town of Fenton, on the Merrimack in Missouri, as
well as that on the Rivière des Pères, in the same vicinity,
already referred to, and those reported to exist in various
other sections of the West, in which, owing to the dampness
of the soil, the remains have been long resolved to
dust, and only the dimensions of the grave have remained.[67]

Among the articles which my host had procured from
these old graves, and deemed worthy of preservation, was
a singular species of pottery, composed, as appeared from
its fracture, of shells calcined and pulverized, mixed with
an equal quantity 212 of clay, and baked in the sun.
The clay is of that fine quality with which the waters of
the Missouri are charged. The vessels are found moulded
into a variety of forms and sizes, capable of containing
from a quart to a gallon.[68] One of these, which my host[Pg 103]
insisted upon hanging upon the bow of my Spanish saddle
as I mounted, was fashioned in the shape of a turtle,
with the form and features very accurately marked. The
handle of the vessel, which was broken off, once formed
a tapering tail to the animal, presenting a rare specimen
of a turtle with that elegant appendage.

Ascending the bluffs by a tortuous though toilsome pathway[Pg 104]
through the ravines, my route for some miles wound
away through a sparse growth of oaks, and over a region
which seemed completely excavated into sink-holes. Some
of these tunnel-shaped hollows were several hundred feet
in diameter, and of frightful depth, though of regular
outline, as if formed by the whirl of waters subsiding to
the level of the plain beneath. They were hundreds in
number, yet each was as uniformly circular as if excavated
by scientific skill. I have met with none so regular in
outline, though I have seen many in the course of my
journeyings.

The puissant little village of Waterloo furnished me
a very excellent dinner, at a very excellent tavern. The
town appeared, from a hasty view in passing through its
streets, remarkable for nothing so much as for the warlike
soubriquet attached to it, if we except a huge windmill,
which, 213 like a living thing, flings abroad its gigantic
arms, and flaunts its ungainly pinions in the midst thereof.
The place, moreover, can boast a courthouse, indicative
of its judicial character as seat of justice for the county
of Monroe; and, withal, is rather pleasantly located than
otherwise. About five miles north of the village is situated
a large spring, and a settlement called Bellefontaine. This
spot is celebrated as the scene of some of the bloodiest
atrocities of the Kickapoo Indians and predatory bands
of other tribes some fifty years since. Many of the settlers
were killed, and others carried into a captivity scarce to
be preferred.[69]
[Pg 105]
An evening ride of a dozen miles, interesting for nothing
but a drenching shower, succeeded by a glare of scorching
sunshine, which, for a time, threatened perfect fusion
to the traveller, or, more properly, an unconditional resolution
into fluidity; such an evening ride, under circumstances
aforesaid, brought me at sunset to the town of
Columbia, a place, as its name denotes, redolent of patriotism.[70]
"Hail Columbia!" was the exhilarated expression
of my feelings, if not of my lips, as I strode across the
threshold of a log-cabin, the appurtenance of a certain
worthy man with one leg and the moiety of another, who
united in his calling the professions of cobbler and publican,
as intimated by the sign-board over his door. Hail
Columbia! All that it is possible to record touching this
patriotic village seems to be that it adds one more to the
five hundred previous villages of the selfsame appellation
scattered over the land, whose chief 214 consequence,
like that of a Spanish grandee, is concentrated and consists
in a title. Every county of almost every state of the
Union, it is verily believed, can boast a Columbia. Indeed,
the name of the Genoese seems in a fair way of being
honoured as much as is that of George Washington; a
distinction we are sure to find bestowed upon every bullet-pated,
tow-haired little rascal, who, knowing not who
his father was, can claim no patronymic less general,
having been smuggled into the world nobody can tell
when or how: George Washington, "Father of his country,"[Pg 106]
indeed, if the perpetration of a very poor pun on a venerated
name may be pardoned.

The earliest peep of dawn lighted me into the saddle;
for, with the unhappy Clarence, feelingly could I ejaculate,


"Oh, I have pass'd a miserable night!"


In sober sadness, sleep, gentle sleep, had visited not my
eyes, nor slumber mine eyelids; though, with the faith of
a saint and the perseverance of a martyr, I had alternated
from bed to board and from board to bed. And throughout
that livelong night, be it recorded, even until the morning
dawned, did a concert of whippoorwills and catydids
keep up their infernal oratorio, seemingly for no other
reason than for my own especial torment; until, sinner
as I am, I could not but believe myself assoilzed of half
the peccadilloes of a foregone life. Happy enough to
find myself once more in the saddle, the morning breeze,
as I cantered through the forest, fanned 215 freshly a
brow fevered by sleeplessness and vexation. The early
beams of the day-god were flinging themselves in lengthened
masses far athwart the plains at my feet as I stood
upon the bluffs. Descending, I was once more upon the
American Bottom.[71] This name, as already stated,
was a distinction appropriated to that celebrated tract
so long since as when it constituted the extreme limit in
this direction of the Northwestern Territory. Extending
northwardly from the embouchure of the Kaskaskia to
the confluence of the great rivers, a distance of about one
hundred miles, and embracing three hundred thousand
acres of land, of fertility unrivalled, it presents, perhaps,
second only to the Delta of Egypt, the most remarkable
tract of country known. Its breadth varies from three
miles to seven. Upon one side it is bounded by a heavy[Pg 107]
strip of forest a mile or two deep, skirting the Mississippi;
and upon the other by an extended range of bluffs, now
rising from the plain in a mural escarpment of several
hundred feet, as at the village of Prairie du Rocher, and
again, as opposite St. Louis, swelling gracefully away into
rounded sand-heaps, surmounted by Indian graves. At
the base of the latter are exhaustless beds of bituminous
coal, lying between parallel strata of limestone.[72] The
area between the timber-belt and the bluffs is comprised
in one extended meadow, heaving in alternate waves like
the ocean after a storm, and interspersed with island-groves,
sloughs, bayous, lagoons, and shallow lakes. These
expansions of water are numerous, and owe their origin
216 to that geological feature invariable to the Western
rivers       the superior elevation of the immediate bank
of the stream to that of the interior plain. The subsidence
of the spring-floods is thus precluded; and, as the season
advances, some of the ponds, which are more shallow,
become entirely dry by evaporation, while others, converted
into marshes, stagnate, and exhale malaria exceedingly
deleterious to health. The poisonous night-dews caused
by these marshes, and the miasm of their decomposing
and putrefying vegetation, occasion, with the sultriness
of the climate, bilious intermittents, and the far-famed,
far-dreaded "fever and ague," not unfrequently terminating
in consumption. This circumstance, indeed, presents
the grand obstacle to the settlement of the American
Bottom. It is one, however, not impracticable to obviate
at slight expense, by the construction of sluices and canals
communicating with the rivers, and by the clearing up
and cultivation of the soil. The salubrious influence of
the latter expedient upon the climate has, indeed, been
satisfactorily tested during the ten or twelve years past;[Pg 108]
and this celebrated alluvion now bids fair, in time, to
become the garden of North America. A few of its lakes
are beautiful water-sheets, with pebbly shores and sparkling
waves, abounding with fish. Among these is one
appropriately named "Clear Lake," or the Grand Marais,
as the French call it, which may be seen from St. Louis
of a bright morning, when the sunbeams are playing upon
its surface, or at night when the moon is at her full. The
217 earliest settlements of the Western Valley were
planted upon the American Bottom, and the French
villagers have continued to live on in health among the
sloughs and marshes, where Americans would most assuredly
have perished. Geologically analyzed, the soil consists
of a silicious or argillaceous loam, as sand or clay
forms the predominating constituent. Its fertility seems
exhaustless, having continued to produce corn at an average
of seventy-five bushels to the acre for more than
a hundred years in succession, in the neighbourhood of
the old French villages, and without deterioration. Maize
seems the appropriate production for the soil; all of the
smaller grains, on account of the rank luxuriance of their
growth, being liable to blast before the harvesting.

XLI



"Gramercy, Sir Traveller, it marvels me how you can carry between one pair
of shoulders the weight of your heavy wisdom. Alack, now! would you but discourse
me of the wonders you saw ayont the antipodes!"

"Peace, ignoramus! 'tis too good for thy ass's ears to listen to. The world
shall get it, caxtonized in a great book."       Traveller and Simpleton.


"Farewell! a word that must be, and hath been;
A sound which makes us linger       yet       farewell!"
Childe Harold's Pilgrimage.



Of the alluvial character of the celebrated American
Bottom there can exist no doubt. Logs, shells, fragments[Pg 109]
of coal, and pebbles, which have been subjected to the
abrasion of moving water, are found at a depth of thirty
feet from the surface; and the soil throughout seems of
unvarying fecundity. Whether this alluvial deposition
is to be considered the result of annual floods of the river
for ages, or whether the entire bottom once formed the bed
of a vast lake, in which the waters of the Mississippi and
Missouri mingled on their passage to the Gulf, is a question
of some considerable interest. The latter seems the
more plausible theory. Indeed, the ancient existence
of an immense lake, where now lies the American Bottom,
upon the east side of the Mississippi, and the Mamelle
Prairie upon the west side, extending seventy 219 miles
northwardly from the mouth of the Missouri where the
Bottom ends, appears geologically demonstrable. The
southern limit of this vast body of water seems to have
been at that remarkable cliff, rising from the bed of the
Mississippi about twenty miles below the outlet of the
Kaskaskia, and known as the "Grand Tower." There
is every indication from the torn and shattered aspect
of the cliffs upon either side, and the accumulation of debris,
that a grand parapet of limestone at this point once presented
a barrier to the heaped-up waters, and formed
a cataract scarcely less formidable than that of Niagara.
The elevation of the river by this obstacle is estimated
at one hundred and thirty feet above the present ordinary
water-mark. For more than an hundred miles before
reaching this point, the Mississippi now rolls through
a broad, deep valley, bounded by an escarpment of cliffs
upon either side; and, wherever these present a bold façade
to the stream, they are grooved, as at the cornice-rocks, by
a series of parallel lines, distinctly traced and strikingly
uniform. As the river descends, these water-grooves gradually
rise along the heights, until, at the Grand Tower,[Pg 110]
they attain an altitude of more than an hundred feet;
below this point the phenomenon is not observed.[73] This
circumstance, and the disruption of the cliffs at the same
elevation, clearly indicate the former surface of the lake.
Organic remains, petrifactions of madrepores, corallines,
concholites, and other fossil testacea, are found imbedded
in a stratum 220 nearly at the base. Similar phenomena
of the water-lines exist upon the cliffs of the Ohio, and a
barrier is thought once to have obstructed the stream at
a point called the Narrows, sixty miles below Louisville,
with the same result as upon the Mississippi. The eastern
boundary of the expansion of the latter stream must have
been the chain of bluffs now confining the American
Bottom in that direction, and considered a spur of the
Ozark Mountains. This extends northeasterly to the
"confluence;" thence, bending away to the northwest, it
reaches the Illinois, and forms the eastern bank of that river.
Upon the western side, the hills along the Missouri are sufficiently
elevated to present a barrier to the lake until they
reach the confluence of the rivers. At this point spreads
out the Mamelle Prairie, sixty or seventy miles in length,[Pg 111]
and, upon an average, five or six in breadth. West of this
plain, the lake was bounded by the range of bluffs commencing
with the celebrated "Mamelles," and stretching
north until they strike the river; while the gradual elevation
of the country, ascending the Upper Mississippi,
presented a limit in that direction.

The event by which this great lake was drained appears
to have been of a character either convulsive or volcanic,
or to have been the result of the long-continued abrasion
of the waters, as at Niagara. The rocks at the Grand
Tower are limestone of secondary formation       the stratum
being several hundred feet in depth, and imbedding
hornstone and marine petrifactions throughout. They
221 everywhere exhibit indications of having once been
subjected to the attrition of rushing water, as do the cliffs
bounding the Northern lakes, which have long been chafed
by the waves. The evidence of volcanic action, or violent
subterranean convulsion of some kind, caused by heat,
seems hardly less evident. The former workings of a
divulsive power of terrific energy is betrayed, indeed, all
over this region. In the immediate vicinity of the Grand
Tower, which may be considered the scene of its most
fearful operations, huge masses of shattered rock, dipping[Pg 112]
in every direction, are scattered about; and the whole
stratum for twenty miles around lies completely broken
up. At the point in the range of bluffs where this confusion
is observed to cease, the mural cliff rises abruptly
to the altitude of several hundred feet, exhibiting along
the façade of its summit deep water-lines and other evidence
of having once constituted the boundary of a lake. At
the base issues a large spring of fresh water, remarkable
for a regular ebb and flow, like the tides of the ocean,
once in twenty-four hours.[74] At this spot, also, situated
in the southeastern extremity of St. Clair county, exists
an old American settlement, commenced a century since,
and called the "Block-house," from the circumstance
of a stoccade fort for defence against the 222 Indians.[75]
By a late geological reconnoissance, we learn that, from
this remarkable tide-spring until we reach the Grand
Tower, the face of the country has a depressed and sunken
aspect, as if once the bed of standing water; and was
evidently overlaid by an immense stratum of calcareous
rock. A hundred square miles of this massive ledge have,
by some tremendous convulsion of Nature, been thrown
up and shattered in fragments. The confused accumulation[Pg 113]
of debris is now sunken and covered with repeated
strata of alluvial deposite. Evidence of all this is adduced
from the circumstance that huge blocks of limestone are
yet frequently to be encountered in this region, some of
them protruding twenty or thirty feet above the surface.
As we approach the Grand Tower       that focus, around
which the convulsed throes of Nature seem to have concentrated
their tremendous energy       the number and
the magnitude of these massive blocks constantly increase,
until, at that point, we behold them piled up in mountain-masses
as if by the hand of Omnipotent might. Upon
all this vast Valley of the West the terrible impress of
Almighty power seems planted in characters too deep
to be swept away by the effacing finger of time. We
trace them not more palpably in these fearful results of
the convulsions of Nature, agonized by the tread of Deity,
than in the eternal flow of those gigantic rivers which
roll their floods over this wreck of elements, or in those
ocean-plains which, upon either side, in billowy grandeur
heave away, wave after wave, till lost in the magnificence
of 223 boundless extent. And is there nothing in those
vast accumulations of organic fossils       spoils of the sea
and the land       the collected wealth of the animal, vegetable,
and mineral worlds, entombed in the heart of the
everlasting hills       is there naught in all this to arouse
within the reflecting mind a sentiment of wonder, and
elicit an acknowledgment to the grandeur of Deity?
Whence came these varied productions of the land and
sea, so incongruous in character and so diverse in origin?
By what fearful anarchy of elements were they imbedded
in these massive cliffs? How many ages have rolled
away since they were entombed in these adamantine sepulchres,
from which Nature's convulsive throes in later
times have caused the resurrection? To such inquiries[Pg 114]
we receive no answer. The secrecy of untold cycles veils
the reply in mystery. The effect is before us, but the
cause rests alone with Omniscience.

How wonderful are the phenomena betrayed in the
geological structure of our earth! And scarcely less so
are the ignorance and the indifference respecting them
manifested by most of our race. "It is marvellous," says
the celebrated Buckland,[76] "that mankind should have
gone on for so many centuries in ignorance of the fact,
which is now so fully demonstrated, that so small a part
of the present surface of the earth is derived from the
remains of animals that constituted the population of
ancient seas. Many extensive plains and massive mountains
form, as it were, the great charnel-houses of preceding
generations, in which the petrified exuviæ 224
of extinct races of animals and vegetables are piled into
stupendous monuments of the operations of life and
death during almost immeasurable periods of past time."
"At the sight of a spectacle," says Cuvier,[77] "so imposing,[Pg 115]
so terrible as that of the wreck of animal life, forming
almost the entire soil on which we tread, it is difficult
to restrain the imagination from hazarding some conjectures
as to the cause by which such great effects have been
produced." The deeper we descend into the strata of
the earth, the higher do we ascend into the archæological
history of past ages of creation. We find successive stages
marked by varying forms of animal and vegetable life,
and these generally differ more and more widely from
existing species as we go farther downward into the
receptacle of the wreck of more ancient creations.

That centuries have elapsed since that war of elements
by which the great lake of the Mississippi was drained
of its waters, the aged forests rearing themselves from
its ancient bed, and the venerable monuments resting
upon the surface, satisfactorily demonstrate. Remains,
also, of a huge animal of graminivorous habits, but differing
from the mastodon, have, within a few years, been
disinterred from the soil. The theory of the Baron Cuvier,
that our earth is but the wreck of other worlds, meets
with ample confirmation in the geological character of the
Western Valley.

As to agricultural productions, besides those of the
more ordinary species, the soil of the American Bottom,
in its southern sections, seems eminently 225 adapted
to the cultivation of cotton, hemp, and tobacco, not to
mention the castor-bean and the Carolina potato. The
tobacco-plant, one of the most sensitively delicate members
of the vegetable family, has been cultivated with
more than ordinary success; and a quantity inspected
at New-Orleans a few years since was pronounced superior
to any ever offered at that market.

As I journeyed leisurely onward over this celebrated
tract, extensive and beautiful farms spread out themselves[Pg 116]
around me, waving in all the gorgeous garniture
of early autumn. The prairie was carpeted with the
luxuriant richness of the golden rod, and all the gaudy
varieties of the heliotrope and asters, and the crimson-dyed
leaves of the dwarf-sumach; while here and there
upon the extended plain stood out in loneliness, like a
landmark of centuries, one of those mysterious tombs of
a departed race of which I have already said so much.
Some of them were to be seen rearing up their summits
from the hearts of extensive maize-fields, crowned with
an exuberance of vegetation; and upon one of larger
magnitude stood a white farmhouse, visible in the distance
for miles down the prairie. The number of these
ancient mounds upon the American Bottom is estimated
at three hundred; far more than are to be found upon any
other tract of equal extent.

At the old French village of Prairie du Pont,[78] situated
upon a creek of the same name, I made the necessary
tarry for some refreshment, upon which breakfast or
dinner might have laid nearly equal 226 claim to bestow
a name. The most striking circumstance which came
under my observation during my delay at this place was
a very novel mode of producing the metamorphosis of
cream into butter pursued by these villagers; a man      uvre
executed by beating the cream with a spoon in a shallow
basin. This operation I beheld carried on by the dark-browed
landlord, much to my ignorance and wonder,
with not an idea of its nature, until the substance produced
was placed upon the board before me, and called[Pg 117]
butter. Prairie du Pont is one of the dampest, filthiest,
most disagreeably ruinous of all the old villages I have
ever visited. A few miles to the north is situated Cahokia,[79]
one of the earliest settlements in the state, and the ancient
residence of the Caoquias, one of the tribes of the Illini
Indians. The place is supposed to have been settled
by the followers of La Salle during his second expedition
to the West in 1683, on his return from the mouth of the
Mississippi. More than a century and a half has since
elapsed; and the river, which then washed the foot of
the village, is now more than a mile distant. This removal
commenced, we are told, shortly after the first settlement,
and well exemplifies the arbitrary character of the Western
waters. Formerly, also, a considerable creek, which yet
retains the name of the village, passed through its midst,
discharging itself into the Mississippi not far below.
The outlet is now several miles higher up; and tradition
attributes the change to the pique of an irritated villager,
who, out of sheer spite to the old place and its inhabitants,
227 cut a channel from the creek to the river, and turned
the waters from their ancient course.

As French immigration at Cahokia increased, the
Indian tribe receded, until the last remnant has long since
disappeared. Yet it is a singular fact in the history of
this settlement, that, notwithstanding the savages were
forced to abandon a spot endeared to them by protracted
residence and the abundance of game in the neighbouring
prairies and lakes, they have ever regarded their
successors with feelings of unchanging friendliness. How
different, under the same circumstances, was the fate of
the settlements of Plymouth and Jamestown; and even[Pg 118]
here, no sooner did the American race appear among
the French, than hostilities commenced.

For many years Cahokia, like old Kaskaskia, was the
gathering-spot of a nomadic race of trappers, hunters,
miners, voyageurs, engagés, couriers du bois, and adventurers,
carrying on an extensive and valuable fur-trade
with the Indian tribes of the Upper Mississippi. This
traffic has long since been transferred to St. Louis, and
the village seems now remarkable for nothing but the
venerableness of age and decay. All the peculiarities
of these old settlements, however, are here to be seen in
perfection. The broad-roofed, whitewashed, and galleried
cottage; the picketed enclosure; the kitchen garden;
the peculiar costumes, customs, poverty, ignorance, and
indolence of the race, are here met, precisely as has more
than once already been described in these volumes. Here,
too, is the gray old Catholic church, in which service is
still regularly 228 performed by the officiating priest.
Connected with it is now a nunnery and a seminary of
education for young ladies. The villagers still retain
their ancient activity of heel and suppleness of elbow; and
not a week is suffered to pass without a merry-making
and a dance. The old "common field" is still under cultivation;
and, uncurtailed of its fair proportions, stretches
away up the bottom to the village opposite St. Louis.
This valuable tract, held in common by the villagers of
Cahokia and Prairie du Pont, has been confirmed to
them by act of Congress; and, so long since as fifty years,
four hundred acres adjoining the former village were, by
special act, granted to each family.[80] The number of[Pg 119]
families is now, as has been the case this century past,
about fifty, neither diminishing nor increasing. Very
few of the inhabitants are of American origin, and these
are liable to annual attacks of fever, owing to the damp
site of the place and the noxious effluvia of the numerous
marshes in the vicinity. Upon the French villagers these
causes of disease exert no effect, favourable or unfavourable.
A few acres of corn; a log cabin; a few swarthy responsibilities,
and a few cattle; a cracked fiddle, and a few cartloads
of prairie-grass-hay in autumn, seems the very
ultimatum of his heart to covet or his industry to obtain.

The road from Cahokia to the city, inasmuch as it is
not often conscious of a more dignified equipage than the
rude market-cart of the French villager, is of no wonderful
celebrity for breadth, or uniformity of track, or excellence
of structure. It extends 229 along the bank of
the Mississippi, and is shaded on either side by the strip
of forest which skirts the margin. After a tarry of several
hours at Cahokia, and an excursion among the mounds
of the neighbouring prairie, near sunset I found myself
approaching "Illinois-town," opposite St. Louis.[81] It
was the calm, soft evening hour; and, as I now advanced
briskly over the prairie, the cool breeze was whispering
among the perfumed grass-tops, and "night's silvery[Pg 120]
veil" was slowly gathering along the retreating landscape.
The sun went down like a monarch, robed in purple,
and the fleecy clouds which had formed his throne
rolled themselves in rich luxuriance along the horizon,
suffused in the beautiful carmine of the heavens. At
intervals an opening in the forest laid bare the scene of
splendour as I hastened onward, and then all was dusk
again. Winding among the group of mounds reposing
in the deepening twilight, and penetrating the grove of
pecans, the moon was just beginning to gild the gliding
wave at my feet as my horse stood out upon the bank of
the stream. Clear and distinct beyond, against the crimson
back-ground of the evening sky, were cut the towers,
and cupolas, and lofty roofs of the city; while in front,
the lengthened line of white warehouses gleamed from
the shade along the curving shore: and the eye, as it glanced
up the far-retreating vistas of the streets, caught a glimpse
of deeper glories along the narrow zone of horizon beyond.
The broad sheet which I was now crossing seemed, with
the oily gliding of its ripples, completely died in the tender
roseate of the 230 sunset sky. As the shades of evening
deepened into night, one after another these delicate
hues faded gently away: and the moonlight streamed in
full floods of misty magnificence far over the distant forests;
the evening-bells of the city pealed out merrily over the
waters; the many lights of the steamers cheerfully twinkled
along the landing; and, as the last faint glimmer of day
had gone out, and night had resumed her sable reign, I
found myself once more amid the "crowd and shock of
men," threading the long, dusty streets of St. Louis....

[Pg 121]



Gentle Reader, the tale is told       our task is ended       


"And what is writ, is writ;
Would it were worthier!"


Our pilgrimage is over, fellow-wanderer. Full many a bright
day have we trod together the green prairies, and glided
over the far-winding waters of the fair Valley. Together
have we paused and pondered beside the mysterious
mausoleum of a race departed. We have lingered among
the time-stained dwellings of an ancient and peculiar
people, and with kindling interest have dwelt upon the
early chronicles and the wild legends of the "far off,"
beautiful West. But autumn is upon us       shadowy
autumn, dark on the mountain-brow. Her purple mistiness
is deepening over the distant landscape; and the
chill rustle of her evening wind, in melancholy whisperings,
wanders among the pennoned 231 grass-tops. Our
pilgrimage ceases, yet with no unmingled emotions do
I say to thee "pax vobiscum!"


"Ye! who have traced the Pilgrim to the scene
Which is his last, if in your memories dwell
A thought which once was his, if on ye swell
A single recollection, not in vain
He wore his sandal-shoon and scallop-shell:
Farewell!"


St. Louis, Oct., 1837.

PREFACE


To those who love their country, and their fellow men,
we present this interesting Narrative, with the hope, we
might say, the certainty, that its perusal will afford them
some moments of the purest gratification. We have seldom
met any thing more entertaining. Its simple, manly
eloquence enchants the attention. The facts it makes
known to us of the "far, far West," the dispositions
and habits of the Indian Tribes who roam over the
vast region of the Oregon, their present state and future
prospects, are such as cannot fail to awaken lively interest
in all who love to look around them beyond the
narrow horizon of every-day scenes, and learn what the
holy servants of God are doing for His sake and in His
name in distant parts of the world. We have conversed
with the apostolic man from whose pen we receive this
narrative; and as we listened we felt at once honoured
and delighted to be so near one who in our days and in
his own person brings before us that lofty spirit of missionary
devotedness       those thrilling scenes of Indian
life and adventure which we so much admire in the pages
of Charlevoix and Bancroft.

vi Truly our country is full of interest to those who
watch its progress, and compare it with the past. Who,
for example, could have dreamt that the Iroquois, the
savage Mohawk,       under which name we best know the
tribe, and whose startling yell so often made our forefathers
tremble,       would have been chosen to kindle
the first faint sparks of civilization and Christianity
among a large portion of the Indian tribes beyond the[Pg 130]
Rocky Mountains? This is one of the singular facts
which these pages present to us. They abound in others
not less singular and interesting. Many of these Indian
nations actually thirst after the waters of life       sigh for
the day when the real "Long Gown" is to appear among
them, and even send messengers thousands of miles to
hasten his coming. Such longing after God's holy truth,
while it shames our colder piety, should also enflame
every heart to pray fervently that laborers may be found
for this vast vineyard       and open every hand to aid
the holy, self-devoted men, who, leaving home and friends
and country, have buried themselves in these wilds with
their beloved Indians, to live for them and God. One
of their favourite plans at this moment is to introduce
among them a taste for agriculture, with the means to
pursue it. They believe it to be the speediest, perhaps
the only way by which the Indians may be won from the
wandering life they now vii in general lead and from
the idle habits it engenders. To aid them in this philanthropic
object is our sacred duty as men, as Americans,
as Christians. It is at least one method of atonement
for the countless wrongs which these unfortunate races
have received from the whites. We should be grateful
to have such an opportunity of doing good: let none suffer
the occasion to pass unhonoured by some tribute to the
noble cause       some evidence of their love for God, their
country and their fellow man.

The frontispiece is from the pencil of one of the Indian
Missionaries.

It blends the skill of the artist with the fancy of the
poet, and will hardly be understood without a word of
explanation. In the foreground we see several of the
gigantic trees of the Oregon forests, fallen and crossing
each other. On these repose two wolves, a squirrel and[Pg 131]
several serpents. Above, two Indian chiefs, surnamed
in baptism after the great Apostles of the Gentiles, Peter
and Paul, are supporting a large basket of hearts,       an
offering to heaven from the grateful wilderness. On
the right are the emblems of Indian life and warfare: the
bow and arrows, battle-axe and shield. Below and above
these are seen some of the most remarkable animals of
the country       the bear, the viii wild horse, the badger,
the graceful antelope, intermingled with the plover, the
pigeon, the wood-cock, the bittern, and other birds of
the region. On the left are the peaceful symbols of
Christianity       the Bible and the Cross, the chalice and
altar lights       the anchor, symbol of faith and hope       the
trumpet, to proclaim the word of God and bid the
desert bless His holy name. Here too we behold several
of the noble animals of the territory       the buffalo, the
deer and elk, the mountain sheep and different birds.
In the distance are seen on the right, Indian mounds,
and a water-spout rising from the river Platte, and on
the left, the Rocky Mountains surmounted by the Cross.
Festoons, composed of the various flowers the Fathers
have met on their way over mountains and prairies and
through lonely vallies, complete the picture       the whole
supported at the extremities by different birds of the
country, and in the centre by the American eagle,       fit
emblem, we may say, of their own dauntless faith,
as well as of the heroic spirit of the nation within whose
borders they have their principal station, and from
whose genuine piety they have received the most consoling
assurances of final success, viz: the Flat Head Indians
and the Pends-d'oreilles, who are styled, even by their
foes, the "nation of chiefs."

ix Once more we earnestly commend the noble cause
of these devoted Missionaries to the charity of every[Pg 132]
sincere Christian. The short time allowed to prepare
the work for the press must be our apology for several
imperfections or errors which may meet the eye of the
reader.

LETTER I


St. Louis University, Feb. 4, 1841.

TO THE REV. F. J. B.

Rev. and Dear Sir:

I presume you are aware, that in the beginning of last
Spring, I was sent by the Right Rev. Bishop of St. Louis,[82]
and my Provincial, on an exploring expedition to the
Rocky Mountains, in order to ascertain the dispositions of
the Indians, and the prospects of success we might have
if we were to establish a mission among them. It is truly
gratifying to me to have so favorable a report to make.       My
occupations do not allow me to enter into all the details;
I shall therefore be satisfied at present with giving
you a brief sketch of my journey and its result.

I started from Westport on the 30th of April, in company
with the Annual Expedition of the American Fur Company,
which for this year had appointed the rendezvous on
Green River, a tributary of the Rio Colorado of the West.[Pg 136][83]
Captain Dripps, who commanded the caravan, treated me
on all occasions with the most polite attention.[84] On the
6th day of our journey I was seized with the fever and
ague, and have been subject to it for nearly five months.
Nothing particularly worth noticing, occurred during the
journey, except, when we halted in the village of the
Sheyennes.[85] I was introduced to the Chiefs as a minister
of the Great 14 Spirit: they showed me great deference,
and I was invited to a feast. I had to pass at first
through all the ceremonies of the calumet; the great chief
approached me to shake hands, and gave me a heartfelt
"How do you do."       "Blackgown," said he, "my heart
was filled with joy when I learned who you were. My
lodge never received a visitor for whom I feel a greater
esteem. As soon as I was apprised of your coming, I ordered
my great kettle to be filled, and in your honor, I commanded
that my three fattest dogs should be served up."[Pg 137]
The bravest warriors of the nation partook of the repast,
and I availed myself of the opportunity to explain to
them the most important tenets of Christianity. I told
them the object of my visit, and enquired whether they
would not be satisfied to have also Black-gowns among
them, who would teach them to love and serve the Great
Spirit, as he wished. "Oh yes," they eagerly answered,
"we will gladly provide for every thing that they stand
in need of; they will not die of hunger amongst us."
I have no doubt but a zealous missionary would do a
great deal of good among them. They are about two
thousand in number. Their language, it is said, is very
difficult. On the 30th of June we arrived at the rendezvous.[86]
An escort of warriors had been provided for me
by the Flat-heads. Our meeting was that of children who
come to meet their parent, and in the effusion of their
heart, they bestowed upon me the fondest names with
a simplicity truly patriarchal. They told me of all the
interesting particulars of their nation, and of the wonderful
preservation of sixty of their men, in a battle against
two hundred Black-feet, which lasted five whole days,
and in which they killed fifty of their enemies, without
losing a single man of their number. "The Great Spirit
watched over them;" they said, "he knew that we were
to guide you to 15 our camp, and he wanted to clear the
road of all the obstacles that you might have found on
your way. We trust we will not be annoyed any more by
the Black-feet; they went off weeping like women." We
thanked heaven for the signal preservation, and implored[Pg 138]
its assistance for the new and perilous journey we were
on the point of undertaking. The Indians of different
nations and the trappers, had assembled at the rendezvous
in great numbers, for the sake of the trade. On Sunday,
the fifth of July, I had the consolation of celebrating
the holy sacrifice of Mass sub dio. The altar was placed
on an elevation, and surrounded with boughs and garlands
of flowers; I addressed the congregation in French
and in English, and spoke also by an interpreter to the
Flat-head and Snake Indians. It was a spectacle truly
moving for the heart of a Missionary, to behold an
assembly composed of so many different nations, who
all assisted at our holy mysteries with great satisfaction.       The
Canadians sung hymns in French and Latin,
and the Indians in their native tongue. It was truly
a Catholic worship.... This place has been called
since that time, by the French Canadians, la prairie
de la Messe.

About thirty of the principal chiefs of the Snake Indians
invited me to a council.[87] I explained to them
the Christian doctrine in a compendious manner       they
were all very attentive       they then deliberated among
themselves for about half an hour, and one of the
chiefs, addressing me in the name of the others, said:
"Black-gown, the words of thy mouth have found their
way to our hearts; they never will be forgotten. Our
country is open for thee; come to teach us what we have
to do, to please the Great Spirit, and we will do according
to thy words." I advised them to select among themselves
a wise and prudent man, who, every morning and
evening, should assemble them to offer 16 to Almighty
God their prayers and supplications; that there the good[Pg 139][Pg 140][Pg 141]
chiefs should have an opportunity of exhorting their
warriors to behave as they ought. The meeting was
held the very same evening, and the great chief promulgated
a law, that for the future, the one who would be
guilty of theft, or of any other disorderly act, should receive
a public castigation. On Monday, 6th, we proceeded on
our journey.[88] A dozen Canadians wished to accompany
me, to have an opportunity, as they said, to practise
their religion. Eight days afterwards we arrived safely
in the camp of the Flat-heads, and Ponderas, or Pends
d'oreilles.[89]


   
   
   Worship in the Desert


Immediately the whole village was in commotion;
men, women and children, all came to meet me, and
shake hands, and I was conducted in triumph to the
lodge of the great chief Tjolizhitzay, (the Big face.) He
has the appearance of an old patriarch. Surrounded
by the principal chiefs of the two tribes, and the most
renowned warriors, he thus addressed me: "This day[Pg 142]
Kaikolinzosten (the Great Spirit) has accomplished our
wishes, and our hearts are swelled with joy. Our desire
to be instructed was so great, that three times had
we deputed our people to the Great Black-gown[90] in St.
Louis, to obtain a father. Now, Father, speak, and
we will comply with all you will tell us. Show us the
road we have to follow, to come to the place where the
Great Spirit resides." Then he resigned his authority
to me; but I replied that he mistook the object of my
coming among them; that I had no other object in view,
but their spiritual welfare; that with respect to temporal
affairs, they should remain as they were, till circumstances
should allow them to settle in a permanent
spot.       Afterwards we deliberated on the hours proper for
their 17 spiritual exercises and instructions. One of
the chiefs brought me a bell, with which I might give
the signal.

The same evening about 2,000 persons were assembled
before my lodge to recite night prayers in common.
I told them the result of my conference with the chiefs;
of the plan of instructions which I intended to pursue;
and with what disposition they ought to assist at them,
etc. Night prayers having been said, a solemn canticle
of praise of their own composition, was sung by these
children of the mountains, to the Author of their being.
It would be impossible for me to describe the emotions
I felt at this moment; I wept for joy, and admired the
marvellous ways of that kind Providence, who, in his
infinite mercy, had deigned to depute me to this poor
people, to announce to them the glad tidings of salvation.
The next day I assembled the council, and with
the assistance of an intelligent interpreter, I translated
into their language the Lord's Prayer, the Hail Mary,[Pg 143]
the Apostles' Creed, the ten Commandments, and four
Acts. As I was in the habit of reciting these prayers,
morning and evening, and before instructions, about
a fortnight after, I promised a beautiful silver medal
to the one who would recite them first. One of the chiefs
rising immediately, "Father," said he, smiling, "that
medal is mine," and he recited all the prayers without
missing a word. I embraced him, praised the eagerness
which he had evinced of being instructed, and
appointed him my Cathecist. This good Indian set to
work with so much zeal and perseverance, that in less
than a fortnight all knew their prayers.

Every morning, at the break of day, the old chief is
the first on horseback, and goes round the camp from
lodge to lodge. "Now my children," he exclaims, "it is
time to rise; let the first thoughts of your hearts be for
the Great 18 Spirit; say that you love him, and beg of
him to be merciful unto you. Make haste, our Father
will soon ring the bell, open your ears to listen, and your
hearts to receive the words of his mouth." Then, if
he has perceived any disorderly act on the preceding
day, or if he has received unfavorable reports from the
other chiefs, he gives them a fatherly admonition. Who
would not think, that this could only be found in a well
ordered and religious community, and yet it is among
Indians in the defiles and vallies of the Rocky Mountains!!!
You have no idea of the eagerness they showed
to receive religious instruction. I explained the Christian
doctrine four times a day, and nevertheless my lodge
was filled, the whole day, with people eager to hear more.
At night I related those histories of the Holy Scriptures
that were best calculated to promote their piety and edification,
and as I happened to observe, that I was afraid
of tiring them, "oh no," they replied, "if we were not[Pg 144]
afraid of tiring you, we would gladly spend here the
whole night."

I conferred the holy sacrament of Baptism on six hundred
of them, and if I thought it prudent to postpone
the baptism of others till my return, it was not for want
of desire on their part, but chiefly to impress upon their
minds a greater idea of the holiness of the sacrament,
and of the dispositions that are required to receive
it worthily. Among those baptised, were the two great
chiefs of the Flat-heads and of the Ponderas. As I excited
the catechumens to a heartfelt contrition of their
sins, the Walking Bear, chief of the Ponderas, answered:
"Father, I have been plunged for a number of years
in profound ignorance of good and evil, and no doubt,
during that time, I have often greatly displeased the
Great Spirit, and therefore I must humbly beseech his
pardon. But when I afterwards conceived 19 that a
thing was bad, I banished it from my heart, and I do
not recollect to have since deliberately offended the Great
Spirit." Truly, where such dispositions are found, we
may well conclude that a rich harvest is to be gathered.

I remained two months among these good people,
and every day they were adding to my consolations, by
their fervor in prayer, by their assiduity in coming to
my instructions, and by their docility in putting into
practice what they had been taught.

The season being far advanced, and as I had waited
in vain for a safe opportunity to return to St. Louis, I
resolved to commit myself entirely to Providence, and on
the 7th of August,[91] I took leave of my dear Neophytes.
I appointed one of the chiefs to replace me during my
absence, who should preside in their evening and morning
devotions, and on the Sabbath exhort them to virtue,[Pg 145]
baptize the little children, and those who were dangerously
ill. Grief was depicted on the features of all, and
tears were glistening in every eye. The old chief addressed
me, saying, "Father, the Great Spirit accompany
thee in thy long and dangerous voyage; every day,
morning and evening, we will address to him our humble
supplications, that thou mayest arrive safely among
thy brethren. And we will continue to do so, till thou
be again among thy children of the mountains. We
are now like the trees that have been spoiled of their
verdure by winter's blast. When the snow will have
disappeared from these vallies, and the grass begins to
grow, our hearts will begin to rejoice; when the plants
will spring forth our joy will increase; when they blossom,
it will still be greater, and then we will set out to
meet you. Farewell, Father, farewell."

The Chiefs would not suffer me to depart by myself       20 thirty
of the bravest warriors were deputed as a
safeguard to traverse the country of the Black-feet, who
are very hostile to the whites, and they were instructed
to accompany me, as far as need would be of their assistance.
I resolved to take on my return a different route
from the one I had taken in coming. I was induced
to do so, in order to visit the Forts of the American Fur
Company on the Missouri, and on the Yellow Stone,
to baptize the children. After five or six days travelling,
we fell in with a war party of the Crow Indians,
who received us very kindly, and we travelled together
for two days. Then we directed our course to the Big
Horn,[92] the most considerable of the tributary streams[Pg 146]
of the Yellow Stone. There we met another party
of the same nation, who were also amicably disposed
towards us. As there was question about religion, I
availed myself of the opportunity to express to them
the main articles of the Christian faith, and as I was
depicting in lively colors the torments of hell, and had
told them that the Great Spirit had kindled this fire of
his wrath, for those who did not keep the commandments
I had explained to them, one of the Chiefs uttered
a horrid shriek. "If this be the case," said he, "then
I believe there are but two in the whole nation who will
not go to that place; it is the Beaver and the Mink; they
are the only Crows who never stole, who never killed,
nor committed all the excesses which your law prohibits.
Perhaps I am deceived, and then we must all go together."
When I left them on the next day, the Chief put a fine
bell on my horse's neck, and invited me to take a turn
round the village. Next, he accompanied me for six
miles.

After several days of a painful journey over rocks and
cliffs, we arrived at last at the fort of the Crows.[93] It[Pg 147]
is the first the American Fur Company possessed in that
country. 21 My dear Flat-heads edified all the inhabitants
by their fervor and their piety. As well in the fort,
as on the road, we never missed performing in common,
our evening and morning devotions, and singing canticles
in honor of the Almighty. Frequently, during my stay
with them, they had given me abundant proofs of their
trust in Providence. I cannot forbear mentioning one
instance that occurred during my travels in this place.
One day as dinner was preparing and provisions scarce,
a countryman of mine, who accompanied me, suggested
the propriety of keeping something in reserve for supper.
"Be not uneasy," said the chief, called Ensyla,[94] "I never
missed my supper in my life. I trust in the mercy of the
Great Spirit, he will provide for all our wants." We
had just camped at night, when the chief killed two stags.
"Did I not tell you right?" he remarked, smilingly, to
my companion. "You see the Great Spirit does not only
provide for our wants of this evening, but he gives us
also a supply for to-morrow."

Now began the most difficult and most perilous part of
our journey. I had to pass through a country supposed
to be overrun by war parties, of the Black-feet, Assineboins,
Gros Ventres, Arikaras, and Scioux.[95] All these[Pg 148]
nations entertained the most hostile dispositions towards
the Flat-heads. I therefore dispensed with their
services any farther. I again excited them to continue
the good work they had begun; to be steadfast in their
faith; regular in their devotions; charitable towards one
another. I embraced them all and took my leave.
Mr. John de Velder,[96] a native of Ghent in Belgium, had
volunteered his services to me at the Rendezvous. In
consideration of the bad state of my health, I deemed
myself very happy to accept of them; he has never left
me since. He was now to be my only travelling companion.
As there is no road, we followed the direction
of the river; at intervals we were 22 obliged to make
immense circuits to avoid the steep and craggy hills that
defied our passage. For two hundred miles, we had
continually death before our eyes. On the second day,
I discovered before daylight a large smoke at a distance
of about a quarter of a mile. We hastily saddled our
horses and following up a ravine we gained a high bluff
unperceived. At night we did not dare to make fire
for fear of attracting notice. Again about dinner time,
we found on the road the carcase of a Buffalo, killed
only two hours before; the tongue and the marrow bones
with some other dainty pieces had been taken away.
Thus the kind providence of our God took care to
supply our wants.

We took a direction contrary to the tracks of the Indians,
and spent a safe night in the cliffs of the rocks. The
next day we struck upon a spot where forty lodges had
been encamped, the fires were yet in full blaze.

Finally, we crossed the Missouri at the same place[Pg 149]
where, only an hour before, a hundred lodges of ill-minded
Assineboins had passed, and we arrived safe and
unmolested at Fort Union, situated a few miles above
the mouth of the Yellow Stone. In all these Forts great
harmony and union prevail; Mr. Kipps, the present
administrator of them, is a gentleman well worthy of
his station.[97] Every where I was treated by these gentlemen
with the greatest politeness and kindness, and all my
wants were liberally supplied. As I was relating the
particulars of this dangerous trip to an Indian Chief,
he answered: "The Great Spirit has his Manitoos; he
has sent them to take care of your steps and to trouble
the enemies that would have been a nuisance to you."
A Christian would have said: Angelis suis mandavit de
te, ut custodiant te in omnibus viis tuis.[98] 23 On 23d
of September we set out for the village of the Mandans,
in company with three men of the fort, who had the
same destination. We met on the road a party of 19
Assineboins, who were returning to their country from
an unsuccessful expedition against the Gros Ventres.
Their looks indicated their bad intentions: although we
were but five in number, we showed a determined countenance,
and we passed unmolested. Next day we crossed
a forest, the winter quarters of the Gros Ventres, and
Arikaras, in 1835. It was there that those unfortunate
tribes were nearly exterminated by the small pox. We
saw their bodies wrapped up in Buffalo robes, tied to
the branches of the largest trees. It was truly a sad
and mournful spectacle. Two days later we met the
miserable survivors of these unhappy tribes. Only ten[Pg 150]
families of the Mandans, once such a powerful nation,
now remain. They have united with the Gros Ventres
and Arikaras. They received me with great demonstrations
of friendship; I spent that night in their camp, and
the next day crossed the Missouri in their canoe, made
of a buffalo skin.[99] The next day we came to the
first village of the Arikaras, and on the following day to
their great village, consisting of about a hundred earthen
wigwams.[100] This tribe also received me very kindly.
On the 6th of October we started from the Mandan
village, for Fort Pierre, on the little Missouri;[101] a
Canadian, whose destination lay in the same direction,
accompanied us. The Commandant of the Fort had
recommended to us in a special manner to be on our
guard against the Jantonnois, the Santees, Jantous, Ankepatines,
Ampapas, Ogallallas, and Black-feet Scioux, who
have often proved very troublesome to white strangers.[Pg 151][102]
On the third day of our journey we fell in with an
ambuscade of the Jantonnois and Santees; they did not
do us any harm, but on the contrary 24 treated us very
kindly, and at our departure loaded us with provisions.
The next day we fell in with several other parties, who
showed us much kindness. On the ninth day we were
on the lands of the Black-feet Scioux; this country is
undulating and intersected with numberless little streams.
For greater caution we travelled in ravines. Towards
dinner time, a fine landscape, near a delicious spring,
seemed to invite us to take some repose. We had
scarcely alighted, when all on a sudden a tremendous yell
alarmed us, and from the top of the hill under which
we were, the Black-feet darted upon us like lightning.
"Why do you hide yourselves?" asked the Chief, in a
stern voice. "Are you afraid of us?" Dressed in my
cassock with a crucifix on my breast,       a costume I always
wear in the Indian country,       it appeared to me that
I was the subject of his particular enquiry. He asked
the Canadian what kind of a man I was. The Frenchman
said I was a Chief, a Black-gown, the man who
spoke to the Great Spirit. He assumed immediately a
milder countenance, ordered his men to lay down their
arms, and we performed the ceremonies of shaking hands
and smoking the calumet of peace. He then invited
me to accompany them to the village, situated only at
a short distance. It consisted of about a thousand souls.
I pitched my tent at some distance, in a beautiful pasture,
on the margin of a fine stream, and invited the
great chief to partake of a supper with me. As I said
grace before meal, he enquired of the Canadian what
I was about. He is addressing the Great Spirit, was[Pg 152]
the reply, in gratitude for the food he has granted us.
The chief nodded a sign of approbation. Shortly after,
twelve warriors, in full costume, stretched a large buffalo
robe before the place where I sat. The chief, taking
me by the arm, invited me to sit down. I was under
the impression that there was 25 question again of
smoking the calumet. Judge of my astonishment, when
the twelve warriors, seizing each a piece of the robe,
took me up, and headed by their chief, carried me in
triumph to their village. In the lodge of the great chief
the most conspicuous place was assigned me, and he
addressed me thus: "This day is the happiest of my
life. For the first time do we behold among us a man
who is so closely united with the Great Spirit. Black-gown,
you see before you the chief warriors of my tribe;
I have invited them to this feast, in order that they may
keep the remembrance of your coming among us as long
as they shall live." Then he invited me to speak again
to the Great Spirit, (to say grace), I began in the name
of the Father and of the Son, etc., and immediately all
present lifted up their hands towards heaven; when I
had concluded they all struck the ground. I asked
the chief what they meant by this ceremony. "When
we lift up our hands," said he, "we signify that all our
dependence is on the Great Spirit, and that he in his
fatherly care provides for all our wants: we strike the
ground to signify that we are only worms and miserable
creeping beings in his sight." He asked me in his
turn, what I had told to the Great Spirit. Unhappily,
the Canadian was a poor interpreter, still I endeavored
to make them understand, as well as I could, the Lord's
Prayer. The chief showed great eagerness to know
what I said.       He ordered his son and two other very
intelligent young men to accompany me to the fort, in[Pg 153]
order to learn the principles of the Christian doctrine,
and to be at the same time a safeguard against the
Indians who might be inimically disposed towards us.
Two days afterwards we met an Indian, whose horse
was bending under a load of buffalo meat. Seeing us
without provisions, he requested us to accept what we
might stand in need of, advising us to take 26 the
whole, for, said he, in the vicinity of the fort, game is
very scarce. Five days afterwards we arrived at Fort
Pierre. Thence I travelled through prairies for nineteen
days successively. We were often obliged to cook our
victuals with dried herbs       not a stick was to be found.
When I arrived at Fort Vermillion,[103] I was apprised that
the Santees had been on a warlike expedition against the
Pottawatomies, of the Council Bluffs, among whom I
had labored the two preceding years.[104]

I invited them to a council, and gave them a severe
reprimand for violating the solemn promise they had[Pg 154]
made me the preceding year, of living with their neighbors
on amicable terms. I showed them the injustice
of attacking a peaceable nation without being provoked;
the dreadful consequences of the Pottawatomies' revenge,
that might end in the extinction of their tribe. I was
requested to be once more the mediator, and they told me
that they had resolved to bury the tomahawk forever.[105]

I had lost two horses on the road; the one I was
riding could hardly support me any longer, and I
was yet three hundred miles distance from the Council
Bluffs. I resolved of course to embark on the Missouri,
and engaged a native Iroquois to be my pilot. At first
we were favored with fine weather, but this lasted only
a few days. Very soon inclement weather set in with
frost and snow; and several times as we drifted down
the rapid stream, our frail canoe was on the point of
being dashed to pieces against the numberless snags that
obstruct its navigation. This dangerous trip lasted ten
days. We generally spent the night on a sand bar. We
had only a few frozen potatoes left when we perceived
a beautiful deer gazing at us, and apparently waiting to
receive its mortal blow. We shot at it. 27 At last we
arrived safe at the bluffs, and on the same night the river
was closed by ice.

So many escapes from the midst of so many dangers
thoroughly convinced me that this undertaking is the
work of God       omnia disponens fortiter et ad finem
suam conducens suaviter. (Who reacheth from end to
end mightily, and ordereth all things sweetly.) I am now[Pg 155]
preparing for my return, and will start early in Spring,
accompanied by three Fathers and as many Brothers.
You are aware such expeditions cannot be undertaken
without the necessary means, and the fact is, I have no
other reliance than Providence and the kindness of my
friends. I hope they will not be wanting. I know that
you must feel deeply interested in this meritorious good
work, I therefore take the liberty of recommending it to
your generosity, and that of your friends       every little
contribution will help. I will be very grateful to you,
if you have the kindness to forward to my address at
the St. Louis University, Mo., before the end of March, or
middle of April, the amount you have collected.

I recommend myself and my dear Neophytes to your
good prayers and holy sacrifices, and rest assured that
we shall not forget our benefactors.

LETTER II

TO THE REV. FATHER ROOTHAAN, GENERAL OF THE
SOCIETY OF JESUS[106]


University of St. Louis, 7th Feb. 1841.

Very Rev. Father:


In a letter, which I suppose has been communicated
to you, I informed the Bishop of St. Louis of the results,
as far as they bear on religion, of my journey to the Rocky[Pg 156]
Mountains. But that letter, though lengthy, could give
you but a very imperfect idea of the desert which I passed
six months in traversing, and of the tribes who make it
the scene of their perpetual and sanguinary rivalship.
It will, therefore, I think, be useful to resume the history
of my mission; and I repeat it the more willingly,
since I am called to penetrate again into those deep solitudes,
from which, I may, perhaps, never return. To
my brethren, who take an interest in my dear Indians,
I owe an account of all my observations upon their
character and customs, upon the aspect and resources
of the country they inhabit, and upon their dispositions,
that they may know how far they are favorable to the
propagation of the Gospel.[107]

We arrived the 18th of May upon the banks of the
Nebraska, or Big Horn, which is called by the French
by the less suitable name of the Flat River.[108] It is one
of the most magnificent rivers of North America. From
its source, which is hidden among the remotest mountains
of this vast continent, to the river Missouri, of which
it is a tributary, it receives a number of torrents descending
from the 29 Rocky Mountains; it refreshes and fertilizes
immense vallies, and forms at its mouth the two
great geographical divisions of the upper and lower Missouri.
As we proceeded up this river, scenes more or[Pg 157]
less picturesque opened upon our view. In the middle
of the Nebraska, thousands of islands, under various
aspects, presented nearly every form of lovely scenery.
I have seen some of those isles, which, at a distance,
might be taken for flotillas, mingling their full sails
with verdant garlands, or festoons of flowers; and as
the current flowed rapidly around them, they seemed, as
it were, flying on the waters, thus completing the charming
illusion, by this apparent motion. The tree which
the soil of these islands produces in the greatest abundance,
is a species of white poplar, called cotton tree;
the savages cut it in winter, and make of the bark, which
appears to have a good taste, food for their horses.

Along the banks of the river, vast plains extend, where
we saw, from time to time, innumerable herds of wild
Antelopes. Further on, we met with a quantity of buffaloes'
skulls and bones, regularly arranged in a semicircular
form, and painted in different colors. It was
a monument raised by superstition, for the Pawnees
never undertake an expedition against the savages who
may be hostile to their tribe, or against the wild beasts
of the forest, without commencing the chase, or war,
by some religious ceremony, performed amidst these
heaps of bones. At the sight of them our huntsmen
raised a cry of joy; they well knew that the plain of the
buffaloes was not far off, and they expressed by these
shouts the anticipated pleasure of spreading havoc among
the peaceful herds.

Wishing to obtain a commanding view of the hunt,
I got up early in the morning and quitted the camp alone,
in order to ascend a hillock near our tents, from which
I might 30 fully view the widely extended pasturages.
After crossing some ravines, I reached an eminence,
whence I descried a plain, whose radius was about twelve[Pg 158]
miles, entirely covered with wild oxen. You could not
form, from any thing in your European markets, an idea
of their movement and multitude. Just as I was
beginning to view them, I heard shouts near me; it was
our huntsmen, who rapidly rushed down upon the
affrighted herd       the buffalos fell in great numbers
beneath their weapons. When they were tired with killing
them, each cut up his prey, put behind him his favorite
part, and retired, leaving the rest for the voracity of the
wolves, which are exceedingly numerous in these places,
and they did not fail to enjoy the repast. On the following
night I was awakened by a confused noise, which,
in the fear of the moment, I mistook for impending danger.
I imagined, in my first terror, that the Pawnees,
conspiring to dispute with us the passage over their lands,
had assembled around our camp, and that these lugubrious
cries were their signal of attack.       "Where are we,"
said I, abruptly, to my guide. "Hark ye!       Rest easy,"
he replied, laying down again in his bed; "we have nothing
to fear; it is the wolves that are howling with joy, after
their long winter's hunger: they are making a great
meal to-night on the carcasses of the buffalos, which our
huntsmen have left after them on the plain."

On the 28th, we forded the southern arm of the river
Platte.[109] All the land lying between this river and the
great mountains is only a heath, almost universally covered
with lava and other volcanic substances. This sterile
country, says a modern traveller,[110] resembles, in nakedness[Pg 159]
and the monotonous undulations of its soil, the sandy
deserts of Asia. Here no permanent dwelling has ever been
erected, and even the huntsman seldom appears in the
best seasons of the year. At all other times the grass
is withered, the 31 streams dried up; the buffalo, the
stag, and the antelope, desert these dreary plains, and
retire with the expiring verdure, leaving behind them
a vast solitude completely uninhabited. Deep ravines
formerly the beds of impetuous torrents, intersect it
in every direction, but now-a-days the sight of them only
adds to the painful thirst which tortures the traveller.
Here and there are heaps of stones, piled confusedly
like ruins; ridges of rock, which rise up before you
like impassible barriers, and which interrupt, without
embellishing, the wearisome sameness of these solitudes.
Such are the Black Hills; beyond these rise the Rocky
Mountains, the imposing land-marks of the Atlantic
world. The passes and vallies of this vast chain of
mountains afford an asylum to a great number of savage
tribes, many of whom are only the miserable remnants
of different people, who were formerly in the peaceable
possession of the land, but are now driven back by war
into almost inaccessible defiles, where spoliation can
pursue them no further.

This desert of the West, such as I have just described
it, seems to defy the industry of civilized man. Some
lands, more advantageously situated upon the banks
of rivers, might, perhaps, be successfully reduced to cultivation;
others might be turned into pastures as fertile
as those of the East       but it is to be feared that this
immense region forms a limit between civilization and
barbarism, and that bands of malefactors, organised
like the Caravans of the Arabs, may here practise their
depredations with impunity. This country will, perhaps,[Pg 160]
one day, be the cradle of a new people, composed of the
ancient savage races, and of that class of adventurers,
fugitives and exiles, that society has cast forth from its
bosom       a heterogeneous and dangerous population, which
the American Union has collected like a 32 portentous
cloud upon its frontiers, and whose force and irritation
it is constantly increasing, by transporting entire tribes
of Indians from the banks of the Mississippi, where they
were born, into the solitudes of the West, which are
assigned as their place of exile. These savages carry
with them an implacable hatred towards the whites, for
having, they say, unjustly driven them from their country,
far from the tombs of their fathers, in order to take
possession of their inheritance. Should some of these
tribes hereafter form themselves into hordes, similar to the
wandering people, partly shepherds, and partly warriors,
who traverse with their flocks the plains of Upper Asia,
is there not reason to fear, that in process of time, they
with others, may organize themselves into bands of
pillagers and assassins, having the fleet horses of the
prairies to carry them; with the desert as the scene of their
outrages, and inaccessible rocks to secure their lives
and plunder?

On the 4th of June we crossed the Ramee, a tributary
river of the Platte.[111] About forty tents erected on its
banks, served as dwellings for a part of the tribe of the
Sheyennes. These Indians are distinguishable for their
civility, their cleanly and decent habits. The men, in
general, are of good stature, and of great strength; their
nose is aquiline, and their chin strongly developed. The[Pg 161]
neighboring nations consider them the most courageous
warriors of the prairies. Their history is the same as
that of all the savages who have been driven back into
the West       they are only the shadow of the once powerful
nation of the Shaways, who formerly lived upon the
banks of the Red River. The Scioux, their irreconcilable
enemies, forced them, after a dreadful war, to pass
over the Missouri, and to retreat behind the Warrican,
where they fortified themselves; but the conquerors again
attacked them, and drove them from 33 post to post, into
the midst of the Black Coasts, situate upon the waters
of the Great Sheyenne River.[112] In consequence of these
reverses, their tribe, reduced to two thousand souls, has
lost even its name, being now called Sheyennes, from
the name of the river that protects the remnant of the
tribe. The Sheyennes have not since sought to form
any fixed establishment, lest the Scioux should come
again to dispute with them the lands which they might
have chosen for their country. They live by hunting,
and follow the buffalo in his various migrations.

The principal warriors of the nation invited me to a
solemn banquet, in which three of the great chief's best[Pg 162]
dogs were served up to do me honor. I had half a one
for my share. You may judge of my embarrassment,
when I tell you that I attended one of those feasts at which
every one is to eat all that is offered to him. Fortunately,
one may call to his aid another guest, provided that the
request to perform the kind office be accompanied by
a present of tobacco.

In our way from Ramee, the sojourn of the Sheyennes,
to the Green River, where the Flat Heads were waiting
for me, we successively passed the Black Hills, which
owe this name not to the color of the soil and rocks that
form them, but to the sombre verdure of the cedars and
pines that shadow their sides; the Red Bute,[113] a central
point by which the savages are continually crossing, when
emigrating to the West, or going up towards the North;
and the famous rock, Independence, which is detached,
like an outwork, from the immense chain of mountains
that divide North America. It might be called the great
registry of the desert, for on it may be read in large
characters the names of the several travellers who have
visited the Rocky Mountains. My name figures amongst
so many others, as 34 that of the first priest who has
visited these solitary regions.[114] These mountains have
been designated the back-bone of the world. In fact a
fitter appellation could not be given to these enormous
masses of granite, whose summit is elevated nearly twenty-four
thousand feet above the level of the sea; they are
but rocks piled upon rocks. One might think that he
beheld the ruins of a world covered, if I may so speak,
with a winding-sheet of everlasting snow.

[Pg 163]

I shall here interrupt the recital of my journey, to give
a short account of the different tribes of the mountains,
and of the territory they inhabit. I will join with my
own personal observations the most correct information
that I could possibly obtain.

The Soshonees, or Root-diggers, appeared in great numbers
at the common rendezvous, where the deputations
from all the tribes assemble every year, to exchange
the products of their rude industry. They inhabit the
southern part of the Oregon, in the vicinity of California.
Their population, consisting of about ten thousand souls,
is divided into several parties, scattered up and down
in the most uncultivated quarter of the West. They
are called Snakes, because in their indigence they are
reduced, like such reptiles, to burrow in the earth and
live upon roots. They would have no other food if some
hunting parties did not occasionally pass beyond the
mountains in pursuit of the buffalo, while a part of the
tribe proceeds along the banks of the Salmon River, to
make provision for the winter, at the season when the
fish come up from the sea.[115] Three hundred of their
warriors wished, in honor of the whites, to go through
a sort of military parade: they were hideously painted,
armed with their clubs, and covered over with feathers,
pearls, wolves' tails, the teeth and claws of animals and
similar strange ornaments, with which each of them 35
had decked himself, according to his caprice. Such as had
received wounds in battle, or slain the enemies of their
tribe, showed ostentatiously their scars, and had floating,
in the form of a standard, the scalps which they won
from the conquered. After having rushed in good order,
and at full gallop, upon our camp, as if to take it by[Pg 164]
assault, they went several times round it, uttering at
intervals cries of joy. They at length dismounted, and
came and gave their hands to all the whites in token
of union and friendship.

Whilst I was at the rendezvous, the Snakes were preparing
for an expedition against the Black-Feet. When
a chief is about to wage war, he announces his intention
to his young warriors in the following manner. On the
evening before his departure, he makes his farewell dance
before each cabin; and everywhere receives tobacco, or
some other present. His friends wish him great success,
scalps, horses, and a speedy return. If he brings back
women as prisoners, he delivers them as a prey to the
wives, mothers, and sisters of his soldiers, who kill them
with the hatchet or knife, after having vented against
their unhappy captives the most outrageous insults:
"Why are we unable," howl these furies, "to devour the
heart of thy children, and bathe in the blood of thy
nation!"

At the death of a chief, or other warrior, renowned
for his bravery, his wives, children, and relatives cut off
their hair: this is a great mourning with the savages.
The loss of a parent would seem but little felt, if it only
caused his family to shed tears; it must be deplored with
blood; and the deeper the incisions, the more sincere
is the affection for the deceased. "An overwhelming
sorrow," they say, "cannot be vented unless through
large wounds." I know not how to reconcile these sentiments
respecting the dead with their conduct towards
the living. Would you believe 36 that these men, so
inconsolable in their mourning, abandon, without pity,
to the ferocious beasts of the desert, the old men, the
sick, and all those whose existence would be a burden
to them?

[Pg 165]

The funeral of a Snake warrior is always performed
by the destruction of whatever he possessed; nothing,
it seems, should survive him but the recollection of his
exploits. After piling up in his hut all the articles he
made use of, they cut away the props of the cabin, and
set the whole on fire. The Youts, who form a separate
people, although they belong to the tribe of the Soshonees,[116]
throw the body of the deceased upon the funeral pile,
together with a hecatomb of his best horses. The
moment that the smoke rises in thick clouds, they think
that the soul of the savage is flying towards the region
of spirits, borne by the manes of his faithful coursers;
and, in order to quicken their flight, they, all together,
raise up frightful yells. But in general, instead of burning
the body, they fasten it upon his favourite charger,
as on a day of battle; the animal is then led to the
edge of a neighboring river, the warriors are drawn up
in a semicircular form, in order to prevent his escape;
and then, with a shower of arrows, and a universal
hurra, they force him to plunge into the current which
is to engulf him. They next, with redoubled shouts,
recommend him to transport his master without delay to
the land of spirits.[117]

37 The Sampeetches are the next neighbours of the[Pg 166]
Snakes.[118] There is not, perhaps, in the whole world, a
people in a 38 deeper state of wretchedness and corruption;[Pg 167]
the French commonly designate them "the people
deserving of pity," and this appellation is most appropriate.[119]
Their lands are uncultivated heaths; their habitations are
holes in the rocks, or the natural crevices of the ground,
and their only arms, arrows and sharp-pointed sticks.
Two, three, or at most four of them may be seen in
company, roving over their sterile plains in quest of ants
and grasshoppers, on which they feed. When they find
some insipid root, or a few nauseous seeds, they make,
as they imagine, a delicious repast. They are so timid,
that it is difficult to get near them; the appearance of
a stranger alarms them; and conventional signs quickly
spread the news amongst them. Every one, thereupon,
hides himself in a hole; and in an instant this miserable
people disappear and vanish like a shadow. Sometimes,
however, they venture out of their hiding places, and
offer their newly born infants to the whites in exchange
for some trifling articles.

I have had the consolation of baptizing some of these
unfortunate beings, who have related to me the sad
circumstances which I have just mentioned. It would be
easy to find guides among these new converts, and be
introduced 39 by them to their fellow countrymen, to
announce to them the Gospel, and thus to render their
condition, if not happy, at least supportable through the
hope of a better futurity. If God allows me to return
to the Rocky Mountains, and my superiors approve of it,[Pg 168]
I shall feel happy to devote myself to the instruction of
these pitiable people.

The country of the Utaws is situated to the east and
south east of the Soshonees, at the sources of the Rio
Colorado. The population consists of about 4,000 souls.
Mildness, affability, simplicity of manners, hospitality
towards strangers, constant union amongst themselves,
form the happy traits in their character. They subsist
by hunting and fishing, and on fruits and roots; the
climate is warm, and the land very fit for cultivation.

I shall join to this account a brief exposition of the
belief of the savages.[120] Their religious tenets are composed
of a few primitive truths and of gross errors: they
believe in the existence of a Supreme Being, the source
of every good, and consequently that he alone is adorable;
they believe that he created whatever exists, and that
his providence over-rules the principal events of life, and
that the calamities which befall the human race are chastisements
inflicted by his justice on our perversity. They
suppose, that with this, their God, whom they call the Great
Spirit, there exists an evil genius, who so far abuses his
power as to oppress the innocent with calamities. They
also believe in a future life, where every one shall be treated
according to his works; that the happiness reserved for
the virtuous will consist in the enjoyment of such goods
as they most anxiously desired upon earth; and that
the wicked shall be punished by suffering, without consolation,
the torments invented by the spirit of evil. According
to their opinion, 40 the soul, upon its entry into the
other world, resumes the form which our bodies have had
in the present life.[121]

[Pg 169]

41 What I am going to add applies chiefly to the tribe
that I have been lately instructing. Besides my escort of
Flat Heads, I had also with me an intrepid Fleming, John
Baptist de Velder, who formerly served as a grenadier
under Napoleon. From the battle fields of Europe he
betook himself to the forests of the New World, where he
has passed thirty years of his life in pursuit of beavers[Pg 170]
and bears. During the Missionary's journey, he was his
devoted friend, and the faithful companion of his dangers.
He has now taken the resolution to traverse the desert only
as a guide to the apostles of the Gospel. He had almost
forgotten his native language, except his prayers, and a
hymn in honour of Mary, which his mother taught him
when a child, and which he daily recited, when engaged in
the adventurous chase.

I found the Flat Heads and the Ponderas assembled, to
the number of sixteen hundred, in the beautiful Peters'
Valley. You know already the reception they gave me,
and I shall never forget it. The enthusiastic joy with
which they welcomed my arrival       the exulting shouts of
the young warriors       the tears of the aged, returning
thanks to the Great Spirit, for having granted them the
favour to see and hear a Black-Gown before their death       that
scene, I repeat it, I can never forget. I shall not
recount the religious exercises of my mission, as the consoling
results of them have been already communicated to
you. You will, 42 perhaps, take an interest in reading
the notes I have collected regarding the character and
habits of my neophytes, during a sojourn of three months
amongst them; living like them, by the chase and on roots,
having only a buffalo's hide for my bed, passing my nights
under the canopy of heaven, when the weather was calm, or
taking shelter under a small tent against the fury of the tempest.

With regard to the character of these Indians, it is entirely
pacific. They never fight, except in circumstances
of lawful defence; but they are, unfortunately, often reduced
to this said necessity, in consequence of the warlike
temper of the Black Feet tribe, who are their neighbours
and implacable enemies. That marauding people appear
to live only for murder and pillage.[122] They are the terror[Pg 171]
of the savages of the west, who endeavour, as much as possible,
to avoid their fatal encounter. But should the Flat
Heads, notwithstanding such precaution, be forced to fight,
their courage is as conspicuous as their love of peace; for
they rush impetuously on their adversaries, whom they prevent
from escaping, and generally make them pay dear for
their cruel attacks.

It is a truth which has become proverbial in the mountains,
that one Flat Head, or one of the Ear Rings, is worth
four Black Feet. If the band of the latter meets a detachment
of Flat Heads, of equal or superior numbers, they
forthwith appear disposed for peace, unfurl a standard, and
present a pipe, in token of friendship. The Flat Heads
always accept these tokens of amity; but they take care to
make their enemies sensible that the motives which influence
their conduct on such occasions are fully understood.
"Black Foot," they say, "I take your pipe, but be assured
that I am aware that your heart is disposed for war, and
that your hands are stained with murder. Let us smoke
43 together, as you desire it, though I am convinced that
blood will soon be made to flow."

The greatest reproach that could be made to the Flat
Heads was their excessive love for games of chance, in
which they often risked all they possessed. The Indians
of Colombia carried this passion to an almost inconceivable
degree; for, after losing their goods, they would stake
their own persons, at first playing for one hand, then for
the other; and if the game continued unfavorable to them,
they played successively for every one of their limbs, and,
lastly, for their head, which, if they lost, they, together with
their wives and children, became slaves for life.

[Pg 172]

The government of the nation is confided to chiefs, who
have merited this title by their experience and exploits,
and who possess more or less influence, according to the
degree of wisdom and courage they have displayed in council
or battle. The chief does not command, but seeks to
persuade; no tribute is paid to him, but, on the contrary, it
is one of the appendages of his dignity to contribute more
than any other to the public expense. He is generally one
of the poorest in the village, in consequence of giving away
his goods for the relief of his indigent brethren, or for the
general interests of his tribe. Although his power has
nothing imperious in it, his authority is not the less absolute;
and it may, without exaggeration, be asserted, that
his wishes are complied with as soon as known. Should
any mutinous individual be deaf to his personal command,
the public voice would soon call him to account for his
obstinacy. I know not of any government where so much
personal liberty is united with greater subordination and
devotedness.

All the mountain tribes differ somewhat from each other
in their dress. The men wear a long robe, made of the
44 skins of the antelope or sheep, with shoes and gaiters of
doe or dog's skin, and a buffalo hide cloak, covered with
woollen cloth, painted in various colours. The Indian
loves to add ornament to ornament: his long hair is decked
with various kinds of feathers, and a great number of ribbands,
rings, and shells. In order to give suppleness to his
limbs, he rubs his body with bear's grease, over which he
spreads a thick layer of vermillion. Children under seven
years of age are scarcely ever clothed, except in winter;
they are afterwards dressed in a sort of tunic, made of
skins, which is open under the arms. They spend whole
days amusing themselves in the water, and sometimes even
in the mire. The women wear a large pelerine, adorned[Pg 173]
with elks' teeth and several rows of pearls. Amongst the
Arikaras, their grand dress consists of a fine chemise, with
doe-skin shoes and gaiters, embroidered in brilliant colours.
A quiver filled with arrows is suspended from the left
shoulder; and a cap of eagles' feathers adorns the brow of
warriors and huntsmen. He that has killed an enemy on
his own land is distinguished by having the tails of wolves
tied on his legs; the bear-killer wears, for a trophy, the
claws of that animal as a necklace; the privilege of a
savage who has taken in battle one or more scalps, is to
have a red hand painted on his mouth, to show that he
has drunk the blood of his enemies. The Indian is not less
proud of his horse, the companion of all his excursions and
of all his dangers, and the friend to which he becomes
extremely attached. The head, breast, and the flanks of
the noble animal are covered with scarlet cloth, adorned
with pearls and fringes, to which are attached a multitude
of little round bells. Cleanliness is a quality not possessed
by the savage, nor are the women more particular in this
respect than the men; for they never wash their pots or
saucepans; and at 45 their meals they often make use of
their straw hats, which have no leaf, instead of bowls.[123]

As I before mentioned, the only prevailing vice that I
found amongst the Flat Heads was a passion for games of
chance       it has since been unanimously abolished. On the
other hand, they are scrupulously honest in buying and
selling. They have never been accused of stealing. Whenever
any lost article is found, it is immediately given to the
chief, who informs the tribe of the fact, and restores it to
the lawful owner. Detraction is a vice unknown even
amongst the women; and falsehood is particularly odious[Pg 174]
to them. A forked-tongued (a liar) they say, is the scourge
of a people. Quarrels and violent anger are severely punished.
Whenever any one happens to fall into trouble, his
neighbors hasten to his aid. The gaiety of their disposition
adds a charm to their union. Even the stranger is
received as a friend; every tent is open to him, and that
which he prefers is considered the most honored. In the
Rocky Mountains they know not the use of locks or bolts.[124]

In looking at this picture, which is in nowise overdrawn,
you will perhaps ask, are these the people whom civilized
men call barbarians? We have been too long erroneously
accustomed to judge of all the savages by the Indians on
the frontiers, who have learned the vices of the whites.
And even with respect to the latter, instead of treating
them with disdain, it would perhaps be more just not to
reproach them with a degradation, of which the example
has been given them, and which has been promoted by
selfish and deplorable cupidity.

The country inhabited by the Flat Heads is as picturesque
as their lives are innocent. We often met in
the neighborhood of the several encampments of the tribe,
majestic torrents, forests with trees that have been growing
for ages, 46 and pastures covered with the traveller's tea,
which, although trampled by numberless horses, embalms the
air with its delightful fragrance.[125] We continually beheld
a grand succession of lofty mountains; some delighted
the sight by their blooming verdure and the imposing
appearance of the woods that crowned their summits, while
others, as red as brick, bore the impressions of some great
convulsion of nature. At the base of the latter may be[Pg 175]
seen piled up layers of lava, and at their tops the ancient
craters are easily distinguished. One day, as the tribe was
proceeding towards the banks of the lake Henry,[126] I felt a
desire to ascend to the top of a mountain, situate between
the waters of the Colombia and the Missouri, in the hope
of discovering the exact place where those two great rivers
rise, and the distance between them. I succeeded in finding
one of their sources: they form two torrents, which,
being divided where they rise, by the distance of scarce a
hundred paces, continually diverge as they descend towards
the plain.[127] Their course over the rocks presents an
enchanting sight: they do not flow along, but roll from
cascade to cascade; and nothing is comparable to the
beauty of their bounding waters, except the distant noise
of their fall, repeated by the echoes of the solitary
mountains.

Finding it impossible to get to the highest top of the
mountain that overlooks these sources, I stopped when I
had reached an elevation of 5,000 feet.[128] I then cast my
eyes upon the immense region that lay extended at my
feet; I contemplated to myself all the tribes upon the
banks of the Missouri, as far as Council Bluffs: I thought
on my dear colleagues, who are sent by Providence, like
angels of salvation, amongst these savages hordes; and I
considered, with mixed feelings of joy and grief, their
labors, consolations, and hopes, and how disproportionate[Pg 176]
is their number 47 to the people requiring the aid of
their ministry. Kind people, what futurity awaits thee?
Holy Missioners, what recompense is reserved for your self-devotion?
I remembered that they and I have in heaven
a powerful intercessor, in the illustrious founder of our
Society; and in order to interest him in our dear missions,
from the summit of that mountain from which I could
nearly view them all, I placed them under his protection.
I would fain persuade myself that he will not prove
forgetful of his followers, who are endeavoring to plant
the Gospel in these countries where it has hitherto been
unknown. Additional apostolic teachers will come hither
to assist us by their zeal, before the vices of civilization
and the proselytism of error have multiplied the obstacles
to the propagation of that faith which all the savages so
anxiously desire to know, and which, like the Flat Heads
and the Ponderas, they would practise with gratitude and
fidelity.

The 27th of August was the day I fixed upon for my
departure.[129] Seventeen warriors, chosen from amongst
the bravest of the two nations, and under the command
of three chiefs, arrived early in the morning, before the
entrance of my cabin.[130] The council of the ancients[Pg 177]
appointed them to 48 serve as my escort while I should
be in the country of the Black Feet and of the Crows.[131] Of
these two tribes, so hostile to the whites, the former never
gives them quarter, and the latter will sometimes spare
their lives only to leave them, after having robbed them of
every thing, to die of hunger in the desert. As we were
liable, every instant, to fall into some ambush, we had
scouts sent in all directions to reconnoitre the place and
examine the defiles; and the smallest trace of a man having
passed before us, was minutely examined. And here we
cannot sufficiently admire the wonderful sagacity with which
Providence has endowed the savage: he will tell you, from
the mere footmarks, the exact day on which the Indian had
erected his tent on the spot, and how many men and horses
had been there; whether it was a detachment of warriors
or a company of hunters, and the nation to which they
belong. We selected, every evening, a favorable site for
our camp, and raised around it a little fort with the trunks
of dry trees, in order to protect ourselves against any surprise
during the night.

[Pg 178]

49 This region is the retreat of grizzly bears, the most
terrible animals of the desert, whose strength equals their
daring and voracity. I have been assured that by a single
stroke of his paw, one of these animals tore away four ribs
of a buffalo, which fell dead at his feet. He seldom attacks
man, unless when he has been surprised and wounded.       An
Indian, however, belonging to my escort, in passing by
a thick wood of sallow trees, was assailed by one of these
ferocious beasts, that sprung furiously upon his horse,
fixed his formidable claws in his back, and brought him
to the ground. The horseman fortunately was not mounted
at the time, and having his gun in his hand, the bear
instantly disappeared in the depths of the forest.

On the 5th of September we crossed a defile, which had
been passed shortly before by a numerous troop of horsemen.
Whether they were allies or enemies, we had no
means to discover. I will here observe, that in these
immense solitudes, although the howling of wolves, the
hissing of venomous serpents, the roaring of the tiger and
the bear be calculated to affright, yet this terror is nothing
in comparison with the dread excited in the traveller's soul,
upon seeing the fresh tracks of men and horses, or columns
of smoke rising in the neighborhood. At such a sight, the
escort at once assembles and deliberates; each one examines
his fire-arms, sharpens his knife and the point of his
arrow, and makes, in a word, every preparation for a resistance,
even to death; for, to surrender, in such circumstances,
would be to expose one's-self to perish in the most
frightful torments. The path that we were following led
us to a heap of stones, piled upon a small eminence; they
were stained with blood, lately spilt; my escort examined
them with a mournful attention. The principal chief, a
man possessed of much sense, said to me, in a solemn 50
tone, "Father, I think I ought to give you an explanation[Pg 179]
of what we are looking at. The Crows are not far off:
in two hours we shall see them. If I be not mistaken,
we are upon one of their fields of battle; and here their
nation must have met with some great loss. This monument
has been erected to the memory of the warriors, who
fell beneath the blows of their enemies. Here the mothers,
wives and daughters of them that died, have been weeping
over their tombs. It is customary for the women to
tear their faces, to make deep cuts in their legs and arms,
and to water these tumulary piles with streams of blood.
Had we arrived sooner, we should have heard their cries
and funeral lamentations." He was not mistaken, as we
immediately perceived a considerable troop of savages at
a league's distance. They were the Crows, who were
returning to their camp, after having paid the tribute of
blood to forty of their warriors, who were massacred two
years before by the tribe of the Black Feet. Being at
present the allies of the Flat Heads, they received us with
transports of joy. There were groups of women with them,
and so disfigured as to excite both pity and horror. This
scene of grief is renewed every year, when they pass near
the tombs of their relations.[132]

The chiefs of the Crows wished to cement, by a great
feast, their alliance with the tribe of our neophytes. As
the language of the two nations is very different, the
conversation was made by signs.[133] I shall endeavor to
describe this dumb language, by mentioning to you how a
bargain, at which I was present, was concluded. A young
Crow, of gigantic size, and clad in his best garments,
advanced into the midst of the assembly, leading his horse[Pg 180]
by the bridle, and placed him before the Flat Head, with
whose horse he offered to make an exchange. The Flat
Head took no notice of him, and kept in an immovable
attitude. The 51 Crow then placed, successively, at the
feet of the seller, his gun, his scarlet mantle, his ornaments,
his gaiters, and, lastly, his shoes. The Flat Head then took
the horse by the bridle, picked up the clothes,      c., and the
sale was concluded without saying a word. The Crow,
though so divested, joyfully mounted his new courser, and
rode several times round the camp, shouting in triumph,
and putting his horse through all his paces.

The principal wealth of the savages of the west consists
in horses, of which each chief and warrior possesses
a great number, that may be seen grazing about their camp.
The horses of the Crows are principally of the Maroon race
of the prairies.[134] They have also many horses which they
have stolen from the Scioux, the Sheyennes, and other
Indians of the south-west, which they had in their turn
stolen from the Spaniards of Mexico. The Crows are
considered the most indefatigable marauders of the desert;
they traverse the mountains in all directions, bringing to
one side what they have taken at the other. The name of
Atsharoke, or Crow, has been given to them on account of[Pg 181]
their robberies.[135] They are practised from their infancy in
this sort of larceny, and they acquire a surprising dexterity
in it; their glory augments with the number of their captures,
so that a finished robber is in their eyes a hero. I
accompanied for two days, these savages, who, I think,
were the finest Indians I had met in all my travels.
They passed the whole time in rejoicings and feasting.
You will not be scandalized, I trust, when I tell you that
I was present at twenty different banquets. I was scarcely
seated in one cabin, when I was called to partake of the
festive entertainment in another.

We arrived, at last, at the first fort belonging to the Fur
Company. The Americans, who have here a trading post,
received us most cordially. At this place I was to part with
52 my faithful Flat Heads. I therefore told them, that,
having before me a country still more exposed to the incursions
of the Black Feet, the Assiniboins, the Big Bellies,
the Arikaras, and Scioux, all of whom are declared enemies
of their tribe, I would no longer peril their lives, on account
of my personal safety; that as for my life, I placed it in the
hands of God, and that I felt a persuasion it would be
preserved, in order that, accompanied by new Missionaries,
I might immediately return to them. I exhorted them for
the last time to remain faithful to the Great Spirit. We
embraced each other, wishing, mutually, a happy return;
and shortly after, accompanied by my faithful Fleming,
I disappeared from their sight amidst the solitary defiles.
We were to pass over several hundred miles of country,
where no road is yet traced, and, like the navigator on the
boundless ocean, with no other guide than the compass.[Pg 182]
For a long time we followed the course of the Yellow Stone,
except when perpendicular rocks arrested our progress and
obliged us to take a circuit. In many places we discovered
forts which the savages are in the habit of raising for
defence, or for concealing themselves, when they are at
war, or waiting for their prey. Perhaps, at the moment of
our passing, they were not without enemies. What a solitude,
with its horrors and dangers! but it possesses one real
advantage: with death constantly before our eyes, we irresistibly
feel, without the possibility of illusion, that we are
entirely in the hands of God, without any support but Him,
without any other refuge than his paternal providence; it
is then easy to make to Him the sacrifice of a life which
belongs less to us than to the first savage who wishes to
take it, and to form the most generous resolutions of which
man is capable. It was really the best spiritual retreat that
I made in my life.

The second day of the journey, on awaking, I perceived,
at the distance of a quarter of a mile, the smoke of
a great 53 fire       a point of a rock was all that separated
us from a detachment of Indians. Without a moment's
delay we saddled our horses and set off, galloping with all
speed along the ravines and beds of dried up torrents. We
rode that day, without resting, more than fifteen leagues,
and we did not encamp until two hours after sunset, lest
the savages, having observed our track, should think of
pursuing us.       The same fear prevented us from lighting
a fire, which obliged us to dispense with supper. I
wrapped myself in my blanket, stretched myself on the
grass beside my companion, and having recommended
myself to God, I endeavored to beguile hunger by sleep.[Pg 183]
My grenadier, more courageous than I, soon snored like
a steam engine in full play.

The next morning we were on our way at day-break;
we advanced with caution, for the country appeared full
of danger. Towards mid-day we met a new subject of
alarm       we found a buffalo, which had been killed about
two hours previously. We thrilled at the sight, when we
thought that the enemy was not far off; and yet we had
reason to thank the Lord for having prepared the food for
our evening meal. The following night we encamped
among rocks, which are the retreat of tigers and bears. I
have already said that the dens of the wild beasts inspire
incomparably less terror to the traveller than the hut of the
savage. I this time slept heavily and well. We always
commenced our journey early in the morning, and each
day had new dangers to face, and to meet occasionally the
fresh traces of men and horses. One day we had to cross
a field of tents, which had been recently abandoned; the
fires were not quite extinguished; but happily we met no
one. At length we saw again the Missouri at the very
place, where an hour before, a hundred families of the
Assiniboins had passed over it. The foregoing is only
a sketch of the 54 long and perilous journey which we
made from the fort of the Crows to fort Union, situated
at the mouth of the Yellow Stone river.[136]

All the country watered by this river abounds in game;
I do not think that there is in all America another place
better suited for hunting: we were continually amidst vast
herds of buffalos; we frequently discovered groups of
majestic elks bounding over the plains, whilst clouds, if I
may say so, of antelopes were flying before us with the
swiftness of the wind. The Ashata, or Big Horn, alone[Pg 184]
appeared not to be disturbed at our presence: we saw them
in groups, reposing on the edges of the precipices, or sporting
on the points of the steep rocks. The black-tailed
roebuck, so richly dressed in its brown coat, frequently
excited our admiration, by its elegant shape, and abrupt,
animated movements, in which it appears scarcely to touch
the earth with its feet.[137] I have already spoken of the
grizzly bears, which are here to be met with in abundance,
as well as the wolves, panthers, badgers and wild cats.
Often the traveller sees the prairie hen and the cock of the
mountain start up from the midst of the heath. The lakes
and rivers are covered with swans, geese and ducks: the
industrious beaver, the otter, and the muskrat, together
with the fishes, are in peaceable possession of their solitary
waters.

The Arikaras and the Big Bellies, who had been described
to us as most dangerous, received us as friends,
whenever we met them on our way. Before setting out for
war, they observe a strict fast, or rather they abstain from
all food for four days. During this interval their imagination
is excited to madness; and, either from the effect of
weakness, or the warlike projects which fill their minds,
they pretend that they have extraordinary visions. The
elders and sages of the tribe are called upon to interpret
these reveries; 55 and they pronounce them to be more
or less favorable to the undertaking. Their explanations
are received as oracles, according to which the expedition
is scrupulously regulated. Whilst the preparatory fast
endures, the warriors make incisions in their bodies, and
bury in the flesh, under the shoulder-blade, pieces of wood,
to which they attach leather thongs, by which they are suspended
from a stake, fixed horizontally over the brink of[Pg 185]
a chasm a hundred and fifty feet deep. They even sometimes
cut off one or two fingers, which they offer as a sacrifice
to the Great Spirit, in order that they may return loaded
with scalps.[138]

In a recent expedition against the Scioux, the Arikaras
killed twenty warriors of the hostile tribe, and piled up
the corpses in the middle of their village. The solemn
dance of victory then commenced, at which men, women,
the aged, and children assisted. After having celebrated,
at length, the exploits of the brave, they rushed, like wild
beasts, upon the mangled and bloody bodies of the Scioux,
parcelled them amongst themselves, and fixed the hideous
trophies to the end of long poles, which they carried in
proud triumph around the village.

It is impossible to form an idea of the cruelty that presides
over the barbarous revenge of those tribes, who are
constantly occupied in mutual destruction. As soon as the
savages learn that the warriors of a rival nation have set
out for the chase, they unexpectedly attack the enemy's
defenceless camp, and massacre the women, old men, and
children in the cradle. Wo to the men who are spared;
their agony is deferred in order to render it more terrible.
At other times they lie in wait in their enemy's path, and
allow the detachment to pass on, until they have in their
power such a portion of it as must infallibly become their
56 prey; whereupon they raise the death cry, and pour
upon the enemy a shower of balls, arrows, and pieces of
rock; this movement is the signal of extermination: the
battle becomes a massacre: the sights of horror which
would freeze the heart of any civilized man, serve only to
inflame the fury of the savage: he outrages his prostrate
rival, tramples on his mangled carcass, tears off his hair,[Pg 186]
wallows in his blood with the delight of a tiger, and often
devours the quivering limbs of the fallen, while they have
scarcely ceased to exist.

Such of the vanquished as have not fallen in the combat
are reserved to adorn the triumph, and are conducted prisoners
to the village of the conquerors. The women come
to meet the returning warriors, amongst whom they seek
with anxious looks their husbands and brothers: if they
discover them not, they express their grief by terrific howling.
One of the warriors soon commands silence; he then
gives the details of the fortunate expedition; describes the
place selected for the ambuscade, the consternation of the
waylaid tribe, the bravery of the assailants, and recounts
the number of the dead and of the captives. To this
recital, which is made with all the intoxication of victory,
succeeds the calling over the names of the warriors: their
absence tells they are no more. The piercing cries of the
women are then renewed; and their despair presents a
scene of frenzy and grief, which exceeds all imagination.
The last ceremony is the proclaiming of victory. Every
one instantly forgets his own misfortunes; the glory of the
nation becomes the happiness of all; by an inconceivable
transition, they pass in a moment from frantic grief to the
most extravagant joy.

I know not what terms to use in order to describe the
torments which they inflict on the wretched prisoners: one
57 plucks off their nails, another tears away their flesh;
red hot irons are applied to every part of their bodies; they
are flayed alive, and their palpitating flesh is devoured as
food.[139] The women, who, in other nations, are more accessible
to the feelings of pity than the men, here shew themselves
more thirsty for revenge, and more ingenious in the
barbarous refinement of cruelty. Whilst this horrible[Pg 187]
drama goes on, the chiefs are gravely seated about the
stake at which the victim is writhing. The latter appears
to be only intent on conquering his anguish: often has the
prisoner been seen to brave his executioners, and with a
stoic coolness exclaim, "I fear not death; those who are
afraid of your torments are cowards; a woman of my
tribe would despise them. Shame upon my enemies; they
have not even the power to force from me a tear. In order
to take me, they supplied their weakness by strategy;
and now, to revenge themselves, they have assembled an
entire people against one man, and they are unable to
triumph over him       the cowards! Oh, if they were in my
place, how I would devour them, how I would sip from
their accursed skulls the last drop of their blood!"

The great village of the Arikaras is only ten miles distant
from that of the Mandans. I was surprised to see
around their habitations large and well cultivated fields of
maiz. The latter Indians still manufacture earthen
vases,[140] similar to those which are found in the ancient
tombs of the savages of the United States, and which,
according to antiquaries, are presumed to have belonged
to a race much more ancient than that which now peoples
the desert of the west. The jugglers of the Arikaras enjoy
a good reputation, and exercise considerable influence over
their credulous countrymen; they pretend to have communication
with the spirit 58 of darkness.[141] They will
fearlessly plunge their arm into boiling water, having previously
rubbed it with a certain root; they also swallow,
without any ill effect, substances on fire, as well as shoot
arrows against themselves. The following is one of the
most singular of their tricks, and one which the Indian sorcerer[Pg 188]
was unwilling to perform in my presence, because
my medicine (meaning my religion) was superior to his. He
had his hands, arms, legs, and feet, tied with well-knotted
cords; he was then enclosed in a net, and again in a buffalo's
skin. The person who tied him had promised him
a horse if he extricated himself from his bonds. In a
minute after, the savage, to the amazement of the spectators,
stood before him perfectly free. The commandant
of the neighbouring fort offered him another horse, if he
would reveal to him his secret. The sorcerer consented,
saying, "Have thyself tied; I have at my command ten
invisible spirits: I will detach three of them and put them
at thy service: fear them not, they will accompany thee
everywhere, and be thy tutelary genii." The commandant
was disconcerted, or unwilling to make the trial, and
thus the matter terminated.[142]

The last observation which I have to make concerns the
redoubtable tribe of the Scioux. Whoever, amongst these
savages, dies in a quarrel provoked by drunkenness, or as
59 the victim of the revenge of a fellow countryman,
receives not the ordinary honours of burial; he is interred
without ceremony and without provisions. The most
glorious death for them is to expire in fighting the enemies
of their nation. Their bodies are, in that case, rolled in
buffaloes' skins and placed upon a raised platform, near
their camps or highways.[143] From some conversations I[Pg 189]
have had with the chiefs of this tribe, I have every reason
to believe that a mission would produce amongst them the
most consoling effects.

I arrived, at length, at Council Bluffs. It would be vain
for me to attempt to express what I felt, on finding myself
again in the midst of my brethren: I had travelled two
thousand Flemish leagues amongst the most barbarous
nations, where I had no sooner escaped one danger than I
met with another. From Council Bluffs to Westport, a
frontier city of the Missouri, I pursued my journey without
obstacle or accident. At Independence,[144] I took the
public conveyance, and on the eve of the new year, I embraced
my dear Fathers of the University of St. Louis.

Recommending myself to your prayers,


I am yours,      c.

P. J. De Smet.





LETTER III



Banks of the Platte, 2d June, 1841.

Rev. and Very Dear Father Provincial:


Behold us at last on our way towards the long wished
for "Rocky Mountains," already inured to the fatigues of
the journey and full of the brightest hopes. It is now afternoon
and we are sitting on the banks of a river, which, it is
said, has not its equal in the world. The Indians call it
Nebraska or Big Horn; the Canadians give it the name of
la Platte, and Irving designates it as the most wonderful
and useless of rivers. The sequel will show that it deserves
these various affixes. It was to enjoy the freshness and
beauty of its scenery that we travelled more than twenty[Pg 190]
miles this morning, without breaking our fast, through a
wilderness without a single rivulet to water our jaded
horses, who must therefore rest where they are till to-morrow.
I am far from regretting the delay as it will give
me an opportunity of commencing a letter which, I know,
will interest you.

Like all the works of God, our humble beginnings have
not been unattended with trials: our journey had even well
nigh been indefinitely postponed by the unexpected non-arrival
of two caravans on which we had confidently relied;
one of hunters, for the American Fur Company; the other
an exploring expedition belonging to the United States, at
the head of which we expected to see the celebrated M.
Nicolet.[145] Happily God inspired two estimable travellers,
61 of whom more hereafter, and afterwards sixty others,
to take the same route as ourselves, some for health, others
for science, or pleasure; but the greater number to seek
their fortune in the too highly boasted land of California.
This caravan formed an extraordinary mixture of different
nations, every country of Europe having in it a representative,
my own little band of eleven persons hailing from
eight.[146]

[Pg 191]

The difficulties of setting out once overcome, many others
followed in succession. We had need of provisions, fire-arms,
implements of every kind, waggons, guides, a good
hunter, an experienced captain,       in a word, whatever
becomes necessary when one has to traverse a desert of
eight hundred leagues, and expects nothing but formidable
obstacles to surmount, and thieving, and sometimes
murderous, enemies to combat,       and swamps, ravines and
rivers to cross, and mountains to climb, whose craggy and
precipitous sides suddenly arrest our progress, compelling us
to drag our beasts of burden up their steep ascents. These
things are not done without toil and money, but thanks
to the generous charity of our friends in Philadelphia,
Cincinnati, Kentucky, St. Louis and New Orleans,[147]
which place I visited in person and which is always
at the head of the others when there is a question of relieving
the necessities of the poor, or showing compassion and
munificence to any who may be in need of assistance, we
were enabled by the resources thence supplied, and by a
portion of the funds allowed by the Lyons Association in
behalf of the Indian Missions, to undertake this long journey.

You have already learned from my letters of the past
year, that I was specially sent among the Flat Heads to
ascertain their dispositions towards the "Black Robes,"
whom they had so long desired. I therefore started from
62 St. Louis in April, 1840, and arrived on the banks of[Pg 192]
the Colorado precisely at the moment when a band of Flat
Heads reached that point on their way to meet me. It was
the rendezvous I had given them. Besides the Flat Heads
I visited during that journey, many other tribes, such as
the Pends-d'oreilles (Ear Rings), Nez Perces (Pierced
Noses), Cheyennes, Serpents, Crows, Gros ventres or
Minatarees, Ricaras, Mandans, Kanzas, the numerous nations
of the Scioux,      c. Finding every where such good
dispositions, I resolved, notwithstanding the approach of
winter and frequent attacks of fever, in order to second the
visible designs of the divine mercy in favor of so many souls,
to commence my journey across the immense ocean of
mountains and prairies. I have travelled without any
other guide than a compass, without any protection from
nations hostile to the whites, but a veteran from Ghent,
formerly a grenadier of the Empire, any other provisions
in an arid desert, than what powder and ball and a strong
confidence in God might procure us. I shall not here
repeat what I have already communicated to you, of my
adventures and the result of this mission. It will suffice to
say, that the unexpected quickness of my return to St.
Louis, the excellent health I enjoyed, even though it was
the midst of winter, and the consoling accounts I had to
give of my reception by the Flat Heads,      c.      c., all contributed
to make the most lively impression on the hearts
of our brethren. Almost every one thought himself called
to share the labors of a mission which offered so many
attractions to their zeal. After due deliberation, the fellow-laborers
allotted me were five in number, namely two
Fathers, Rev. Mr. Point[148] of La Vendee, as zealous and[Pg 193]
courageous for the salvation of souls as his compatriot,
La Roche Jacquelin[149] was in the service of his lawful
sovereign; Rev. Mr. Mengarini, recently from 63 Rome,
specially selected by the Father General himself, for this
mission, on account of his age, his virtues, his great facility
for languages and his knowledge of medicine and music;[150]
and three lay-brothers, two Belgians, Claessens and Huet,
and one German, of whom the first is a blacksmith, the
second a carpenter, and the third a tinner, or a sort of factotum;[151]
all three industrious, devoted to the Missions and[Pg 194]
full of good will. They had long ardently desired to be
employed on these missions and I thank God that had the
choice been left to myself, I could have made none better.
Thus launched into the midst of this interminable Far
West, how often did I repeat these beautiful lines of Racine:


O Dieu, par quelles routes inconnues aux mortels
Ta Sagesse conduit tes desseins eternels!


In seven days from my departure from St. Louis, namely,
on the 30th of April, I arrived at Westport, a frontier
town on the West of the United States. It took us seven
days, on board a steamboat,[152] to perform this journey of
900 miles, no unfair average of the time required to travel
such a distance on the Missouri, at the breaking up of the
winter, when, though the ice is melted, the water is still
so low, the sand banks so close together and the snags so
numerous that boats cannot make greater headway....
We landed on the right bank of the river, and took refuge
in an abandoned little cabin, where a poor Indian woman
had died a few days before, and in this retreat, so like to
that which once merited the preference of the Saviour and
for which was thenceforth to be substituted only the shelter
of a tent in the wilderness, we took up our abode until the
10th May       occupied as well we might be in supplying the
wants created by the burning of our baggage waggon on
board the steamboat, the sickness of one of our horses
64 which we were compelled to leave after us, and the loss
of another that escaped from us at the moment of landing.

We started, then, from Westport, on the 10th of May,
and after having passed by the lands of the Shawnees and
Delawares, where we saw nothing remarkable but the college
of the Methodists,[153] built, it is easy to divine for what,[Pg 195][Pg 196][Pg 197]
where the soil is richest; we arrived after five day's march
on the banks of the Kanzas river, where we found those of
our companions, who had travelled by water, with a part
of our baggage.[154] Two of the relatives of the grand chief
had come twenty miles from that place to meet us, one
of whom helped our horses to pass the river in safety,
by swimming before them, and the other announced our
arrival to the principal men of the tribe who waited for
us on the opposite bank. Our baggage, waggons and men
crossed in a pirogue, which, at a distance, looked like one
of those gondolas that glide through the streets of Venice.
As soon as the Kanzas understood that we were going to
encamp on the banks of the Soldier's River,[155] which is only
six miles from the village, they galloped rapidly away from
our Caravan, disappearing in a cloud of dust, so that we
had scarcely pitched our tents when the great Chief presented
himself with six of his bravest warriors, to bid us
welcome. After having made me sit down on a mat spread
on the ground, he, with much solemnity, took from his
pocket a Portfolio containing the honorable titles that gave
him a right to our friendship and placed them in my hands.
I read them, and having, with the tact of a man accustomed
to the etiquette of savage life, furnished him the means of
smoking the Calumet, he made us accept for our guard the
two braves who had come to meet us. Both were armed
like warriors, one carrying a lance and a buckler, and the[Pg 198]
other a bow and arrows, with a naked sword and a collar
65 made of the claws of four bears which he had killed
with his own hand. These two braves remained faithful
at their post during the three days and three nights that
we had to wait the coming up of the stragglers of the
caravan. A small present which we made them at our
departure, secured us their friendship.


   
   
   Kanza Village


On the 19th we continued our journey to the number of
seventy souls, fifty of whom were capable of managing the
rifle       a force more than sufficient to undertake with prudence
the long march we had to make. Whilst the rest of
our company inclined to the West, Father Point, a young
Englishman and myself turned to the left, to visit the nearest
village of our hosts.[156] At the first sight of their wigwams,
we were struck at the resemblance they bore to the
large stacks of wheat which cover our fields in harvest-time.
There were of these in all no more than about
twenty, grouped together without order, but each covering a
space of about one hundred and twenty feet in circumference,
and sufficient to shelter from thirty to forty persons.
The entire village appeared to us to consist of from seven
to eight hundred souls       an approximation which is justified
by the fact that the total population of the tribe is
confined to two villages, together numbering 1900 inhabitants.
These cabins, however humble they may appear,
are solidly built and convenient. From the top of the wall,
which is about six feet in height, rise inclined poles, which
terminate round an opening above, serving at once for[Pg 199]
chimney and window. The door of the edifice consists of
an undressed hide on the most sheltered side, the hearth
occupies the centre and is in the midst of four upright posts
destined to support the rotunda; the beds are ranged round
the wall and the space between the beds and the hearth is
occupied by the members 66 of the family, some standing,
others sitting or lying on skins, or yellow colored mats. It
would seem that this last named article is regarded as a
piece of extra finery, for the lodge assigned to us had one
of them.[157]

It would be difficult to describe all the curiosities we
beheld during the hour we passed among these truly
strange beings; a Teniers would have envied us. What
most excited our attention was the peculiar physiognomy
of the greater number of these personages, their vivacity of
expression, singular costume, diversity of amusement and
fantastic attitudes and gestures. The women alone were
occupied, and in order to attend to their various duties with
less distraction, they had placed those of their papooses
who were unable to walk, on beds or on the floor, or at their
feet, each tightly swathed and fastened to a board, to preserve
it from being injured by surrounding objects. This
machine, which I shall not call either cradle or chair, is
carried, when they travel, either on the back, after the
fashion of the gypsies and fortune-tellers in Europe, or at
their side, or more frequently, suspended from the pummel
of the saddle, while they lead or drive their ponies,
laden with the rest of their goods and chattels. With such
encumbrances they manage to keep pace with their husbands,
who generally keep their horses at a gallop. But
let us return to our wigwam. How were the men occupied?
When we entered, some were preparing to eat,[Pg 200]
(this is their great occupation when they are not asleep)
others were smoking, discharging the fumes of the tobacco
by their mouths and nostrils, reminding one of the funnels
of a steamboat; they talked, they plucked out their beard
and the hair of their eye-brows, they made their toilette;
the head receiving particular attention. Contrary to the
custom of the other tribes, who let the hair on their heads
grow, (one of 67 the Crows has hair eleven feet long) the
Kanzas shave theirs, with the exception of a well curled tuft
on the crown, destined to be wreathed with the warrior's
plume of eagle's feathers, the proudest ornament with
which the human head can be adorned.[158] While we were
smoking I could not help watching the motions of a young
savage, a sort of dandy, who ceased not to arrange, over
and over again, his bunch of feathers before a looking
glass, apparently unable to give it the graceful finish he
intended.       Father Point, having suffered his beard to
grow, soon became an object of curiosity and laughter, to
the children       a beardless chin and well picked brows and
eye-lashes being, among them, indispensable to beauty.
Next come the Plume and Slit-ears, with their pendants of
beads and other trinkets. This is but a part of their finery,
and the pains thus taken to reach the beau-ideal of personal
decorations, are but a faint specimen of their vanity. Do
you wish to have an idea of a Kanza satisfied with himself
in the highest degree? Picture him to yourself with rings
of vermillion encircling his eyes, with white, black, or red
streaks running down his face, a fantastic necklace, adorned
in the center with a large medal of silver or copper,
dangling on his breast; bracelets of tin, copper, or brass,
on his arms and wrists; a cincture of white around
his waist, a cutlass and scabbard, embroidered shoes or
mocasins on his feet; and, to crown all, a mantle, it matters[Pg 201]
not for the color, thrown over the shoulders and falling
around the body in such folds or drapery as the wants
or caprice of the wearer may direct, and the individual
stands before you as he exhibited himself to us.

As for dress, manners, religion, modes of making war,
     c., the Kanzas are like the savages of their neighborhood,
with whom they have preserved peaceful and friendly
relations 68 from time immemorial. In stature, they are
generally tall and well made. Their physiognomy is manly,
their language is guttural, and remarkable for the length
and strong accentuation of the final syllables. Their style
of singing is monotonous, whence it may be inferred that
the enchanting music heard on the rivers of Paraguay,
never cheers the voyager on the otherwise beautiful streams
of the country of the Kanzas.

With regard to the qualities which distinguish man
from the brute, they are far from being deficient. To
bodily strength and courage they unite a shrewdness and
address superior to other savages, and in their wars or the
chase, they make a dexterous use of fire arms, which gives
them a decided advantage over their enemies.

Among the chiefs of this tribe are found men really distinguished
in many respects. The most celebrated was
"White Plume," whom the author of the Conquest of
Grenada represents as a man of great powers of mind and
chivalrous character.[159] He was endowed with uncommon
intelligence, frankness, generosity and courage. He
had been particularly acquainted with Rev. Mr. De la
Croix, one of the first Catholic Missionaries that visited
that part of the West, and conceived for him and his colleagues,
the "Black Robes" profound esteem.[160] His feelings[Pg 202]
towards the Protestant Missionaries were far different.
He had neither esteem nor veneration for them or their
reformation. When on a certain occasion one of them
spoke to him of conversion; "conversion," said the unsophisticated
savage, "is a good thing when the change is made
for something good. For my part, I know none such but
what is taught and practised by the Black Robes. If then
you desire me to change, you must first quit your wife and
then put on the habit I shall show you, and then we shall
69 see further." This habit was a priest's cassock, which
a missionary had left him with the memory of his virtues.       We
presume we need not add that these hard conditions
were not complied with by the preacher.

It is not to be inferred from the apparent pleasantry of
this remark that the chief spoke lightly of Religion; on
the contrary, the Kanzas, like all the Indian tribes, never
speak on the subject without becoming solemnity. The
more they are observed the more evident does it become
that the religious sentiment is deeply implanted in their
souls, and is, of all others, that which is most frequently
expressed by their words and actions. Thus, for instance,
they never take the calumet, without first rendering some
homage to the Great Spirit. In the midst of their most
infuriate passions they address him certain prayers, and
even in assassinating a defenceless child, or a woman, they
invoke the Master of life. To be enabled to take many
a scalp from their enemies, or to rob them of many[Pg 203][Pg 204][Pg 205]
horses, becomes the object of their most fervid prayers, to
which they sometimes add fasts, macerations and sacrifices.
What did they not do last spring, to render the heavens
propitious? And for what? To obtain the power, in the
absence of their warriors, to massacre all the women and
children of the Pawnees! And in effect they carried off the
scalps of ninety victims, and made prisoners of all whom
they did not think proper to kill. In their eyes, revenge,
far from being a horrible vice, is the first of virtues, the distinctive
mark of great souls, and a complete vindication of
the most atrocious cruelty. It would be time lost to attempt
to persuade them that there can be neither merit, nor glory,
in the murder of a disarmed and helpless foe. There is
but one exception to this barbarous code, it is when an
enemy voluntarily seeks a refuge in one of their villages.
As long as 70 he remains in it, his asylum is inviolable       his
life is more safe than it would be in his own wigwam. But
wo to him if he attempt to fly       scarcely has he taken a single
step, before he restores to his hosts all the imaginary
rights which the spirit of vengeance had given them to his
life! However cruel they may be to their foes, the Kanzas
are no strangers to the tenderest sentiments of piety, friendship
and compassion. They are often inconsolable for the
death of their relations, and leave nothing undone to give
proof of their sorrow. Then only do they suffer their hair
to grow       long hair being a sign of long mourning. The
principal chief apologised for the length of his hair, informing
us, of what we could have divined from the sadness of
his countenance, that he had lost his son. I wish I could
represent to you the respect, astonishment and compassion,
expressed on the countenances of three others, when they
visited our little Chapel for the first time.[161] When we[Pg 206]
showed them an "Ecce Homo" and a statue of our Lady of
the seven Dolours, and the interpreter explained to them
that that head crowned with thorns, and that countenance
defiled with insults, were the true and real image of a God
who had died for the love of us, and that the heart they saw
pierced with seven swords, was the heart of his mother, we
beheld an affecting illustration of the beautiful thought of
Tertullian, that the soul of man is naturally Christian!
On such occasions, it is surely not difficult, after a short
instruction on true faith and the love of God, to excite feelings
of pity for their fellow creatures in the most ferocious
bosoms. What were the Iroquois before their conversions,
and what have they not since become? Why do the Kanzas
and so many other tribes on the confines of civilization,
still retain that savage ferocity of manners? Why have
the great sums expended in their behalf by Protestant philanthropy
71 produced no satisfactory results? Why are
the germs of civilization so thickly scattered among these
tribes, as it were, stricken with sterility? Ah! it is doubtless,
because something more than human policy and zeal
of Protestantism is necessary to civilize the savages and
make them Christians. May the God of Mercies, in
whom we alone place all our trust, bless our undertaking
and enable us to predict that our sweat, mixed with the
fertilizing dew of heaven, will fall auspiciously on this long
barren earth, and make it produce something else besides
briars and thorns! When we took leave of our hospitable
hosts, two of their warriors, to one of whom they gave the
title of Captain, escorted us a short distance on the road,
which lay through a vast field which had been cleared and
planted for them by the United States, but which had been
ravaged before the harvest home       sad proof of what we
have stated above.


   
   
   Interior of a Kanza Lodge


Our escort continued with us until the day following, and[Pg 207]
would have remained with us still longer, did they not fear
the terrible reprisals of the Pawnees, for the massacre
committed some months previously. Having therefore
received our thanks and a portion of tobacco, they resumed
the road to their village, just in time to escape the vengeance
of a party of Pawnees, whom we met two days later,
in quest of the Kanzas!

The Pawnees are divided into four tribes, scattered over
the fertile borders of the Platte River.[162] Though six times
more numerous than the Kanzas, they have almost on
every occasion been conquered by the latter, because they
are far inferior to them in the use of arms, and in strength
and courage. Yet as the party just mentioned seemed to
have adopted decisive measures, and as their thirst of
revenge had been stimulated to the highest degree by the
still fresh recollection of what their mothers, their wives
and children 72 had suffered, we had reason to fear for
the Kanzas. Already we fancied that we saw the blood
streaming on all sides, when, two days after we had passed
them, we saw them return to meet us. The two first who
approached us, excited our attention, the one by a human
scalp, which hung suspended from the neck of his horse,
the other by an American flag, which he had wrapped
around his body, in the form of a cloak. This kind of
attire made us tremble for the fate of our hosts; but the
captain of the caravan having asked them by signs concerning
the result of their expedition, they informed us that
they had not even seen the enemy, and that they suffered
much from the cravings of hunger. We gave to them, and
to about fifteen others who followed them, both victuals
and tobacco. They devoured the victuals, but did not[Pg 208]
smoke; and, contrary to the custom of the Indians, who
generally expect to get a second meal after the first, they
left us in a manner which indicated that they were dissatisfied.
The suddenness of their departure, their refusal
to smoke the calumet, the unexpected return of their party,
the neighborhood of their villages, and their well known
love of plunder       in short, every thing induced us to fear
that they had some design to make an attempt, if not upon
our persons, at least upon the baggage; but, God be praised,
not one re-appeared after the departure of the party.

Though addicted to the practice of lying and stealing,
yet, what must appear wonderful, the Pawnees are in some
respects true believers, with regard to the certainty of a
future life, and display a pharisaical punctuality in the
observance of their superstitious rites. Dancing and
music, as well as fasting, prayer and sacrifice, form an
essential part of their worship. The most common worship
among them is that which they offer to a stuffed bird,
filled with 73 herbs and roots, to which they attribute a
supernatural virtue.[163] They protest that this Manitoo
had been sent to their ancestors by the Morning Star, to
be their mediator when they should stand in need of some
particular favor.       Hence, whenever they enter upon some
important undertaking, or wish to avert some great evil,
they expose the Mediator-bird to public veneration; and
in order to render both him and the Great Manitoo (or
Spirit) by whom he is sent, propitious to them, they smoke
the calumet, and blow the first smoke that issues from it
towards the part of the sky where shines their protectress.

On the most solemn occasions the Pawnees add a bloody[Pg 209]
sacrifice to the oblation of the calumet; and according to
what they pretend to have learned from the bird and the
Star, the sacrifice most agreeable to the Great Spirit is
that of an enemy immolated in the most cruel manner.
It is impossible to listen without horror to the recital of
the circumstances that attended the sacrifice of a young
female, of the Scioux tribe, in the course of the year 1837.
It was about seed time, and they thus sought to obtain a
plentiful harvest. I shall here give the substance of the
detailed account, which I have given of it in a former
letter. This young girl, was only aged fifteen; after having
been well treated and fed for six months, under pretence
that a feast would be prepared for her at the opening of
the summer season, felt rejoiced when she saw the last
days of winter roll by. The day fixed upon for the feast
having dawned, she passed through all the preparatory
ceremonies, and was then arrayed in her finest attire, after
which she was placed in a circle of warriors, who seemed
to escort her for the purpose of showing her deference.
Besides their wonted arms, each one of these warriors
had two pieces of wood, which he had received at the hands
of the maiden. The 74 latter had on the preceding day
carried three posts, which she had helped to fell in the
neighboring forest: but supposing that she was walking
to a triumph, and her mind being filled with the most
pleasing ideas, the victim advanced towards the place of her
sacrifice with those mingled feelings of joy and timidity,
which, under similar circumstances, are naturally excited
in the bosom of a girl of her age.

During their march, which was rather long, the silence
was interrupted only by religious songs and invocations
to the Master of life, so that whatever affected the senses,
tended to keep up the deceitful delusion under which she
had been till that moment. But as soon as she had reached[Pg 210]
the place of sacrifice, where nothing was seen but fires,
torches, and instruments of torture, the delusion began to
vanish and her eyes were opened to the fate that awaited
her. How great must have been the surprise, and soon
after the terror which she felt, when she found it no longer
possible to doubt of their intentions? Who could describe
her poignant anguish? She burst into tears; she raised
loud cries to heaven       she begged, entreated, conjured her
executioners to have pity on her youth, her innocence, her
parents, but all in vain: neither tears, nor cries, nor the
promises of a trader who happened to be present, softened
the hearts of these monsters. She was tied with ropes to
the trunk and branches of two trees, and the most sensitive
parts of her body were burnt with torches made of the wood
which she had with her own hands distributed to the warriors.       When
her sufferings lasted long enough to weary
the fanatical fury of her ferocious tormentors, the great
chief shot an arrow into her heart; and in an instant this
arrow was followed by a thousand others, which, after having
been violently turned and twisted in the wounds, were
torn from them in such a manner that her whole body presented
but 75 one shapeless mass of mangled flesh, from
which the blood streamed on all sides. When the blood
had ceased to flow, the greater sacrificator approached the
expiring victim, and to crown so many atrocious acts, tore
out her heart with his own hands, and after uttering the
most frightful imprecations against the Scioux nation,
devoured the bleeding flesh, amid the acclamations of his
whole tribe. The mangled remains were then left to be
preyed upon by wild beasts, and when the blood had been
sprinkled on the seed, to render it fertile, all retired to
their cabins, cheered with the hope of obtaining a copious
harvest.[164]
[Pg 211]
Such horrid cruelties could not but draw down the wrath
of heaven upon their nation. And in fact, as soon as the
report of the sacrifice reached the Scioux, they burned
with the desire to avenge their honor, and swore to a man
that they would not rest satisfied till they should have
killed as many Pawnees as the young victim had bones in
her fingers and joints in her body. More than a hundred
Pawnees have at length fallen beneath their tomahawks,
and their fury was afterwards more increased by the massacre
of their wives and children, of which I have spoken
before.

At the sight of so much cruelty, who could mistake the
agency of the enemy of mankind, and who would refuse
to exert himself for the purpose of bringing these benighted
nations to the knowledge of the true Mediator, and of the
only true sacrifice, without which, it is impossible to appease
the divine justice.


Rev. and dear Father, yours,

P. J. De Smet, S.J.

LETTER IV


Eau Sucree,[165] 14th July, 1841.

Very Rev. and Dear Father Provincial:


Already two long months have elapsed since we began
our journey; but we are at length in sight of those dear
mountains that have so long been the object of our desires.[166]
They are called Rocky, because they are almost entirely
formed of granite and silex, or flint stone. The length,
position, and elevation of this truly wonderful chain of
mountains, have induced geographers to give to it the
appellation of "the back-bone of the western hemisphere."
Traversing almost the whole of North America,
from north to south, containing the sources of some of the
largest streams of the world, this chain has for its branches,
towards the west, "the spur of the Cordilleras," which
divide the Empire of Mexico, and towards the east the less
known but not less wonderful mountains of the Wind River,
where are found the sources of the large streams that empty
themselves into the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The
Black Hills and the table lands called Prairie hills, which
separate the sources of the upper Missouri from those of
the Mississippi, the Ozark and the Masserne ridges may
all be considered as so many collateral chains of the Rocky
Mountains.

According to trigonometrical calculations, and observations,[Pg 213]
made by means of the barometer, Mr. Boneville,[167]
77 in his Memoirs, asserts that the summits of some of
these mountains are 25,000 feet high.[168] This height would
appear much exaggerated, if we consulted only the testimony
of the eyes, but it is well known that the mountains
which are found in immense plains, are not unlike ships
seen on the ocean; they appear much less elevated than
they are in reality. Whatever may be the height of these
colossal mountains, it was at their base that we hoped to
meet our dear neophytes. But a messenger we had sent
to acquaint them with our arrival, has just returned, and
informed us that the Indians who lay encamped there,
about a fortnight ago, went in a southerly direction to hunt
the buffalo. We know not whether those Indians were
Flat Heads or belong to another nation, and it is to obtain
information on this subject, that we are going to despatch
a second messenger. In the mean time, I shall continue
my journal. The numerous notes, which, on account of
our slow progress, we have been enabled to take on the
spot, will warrant that exactness of description, which is
the more desirable, as it is a quality frequently wanting in
the accounts given of these distant regions. Not to exceed
the bounds of a lengthy letter, I shall say but little concerning
perspectives, flowers, birds, animals, Indians, and
adventures.

With the exception of the mounds which run parallel
to each other on both sides of the Platte river, and after
passing under the Black Hills, disappear at the base of the
Rocky Mountains, the whole plain which we traversed for
1500 miles after we had left Westport, might be called the[Pg 214]
Prairie Ocean. In fact, nearly the whole of this territory
is of an undulating form, and the undulations resemble
the billows of the sea when agitated by the storm. On the
tops of some of these elevations we have seen shells and
petrifactions, such as are found on several mountains in
78 Europe. No doubt, some impartial geologists may
discover here, as they have done elsewhere, incontestible
proofs of the deluge. A petrified fragment which I have
in my possession, seems to contain a number of these shells.

In proportion as one removes from the banks of the Missouri
or penetrates into the Western regions, the forests
lose much in height, density and depth, in consequence of
the scarcity of water. Soon after, only the rivers are lined
with narrow skirts of wood, in which are seldom seen any
lofty creeks. In the neighborhood of creeks and rivulets
we generally find willow bushes, and where there is no
water it would be vain to look for any thing but grass, and
even this grass is only found in the fertile plains that lie
between Westport and the Platte river.

This intimate connexion between rivers and forests is so
striking to the eye, that our beasts of burden had not journeyed
more than eight days through this desert, when we
saw them in some manner exult and double their pace at
the sight of the trees that appeared at a distance. This
was chiefly observable when the day's journey had been
rather long. This scarcity of wood in the western regions,
so much at variance with what is seen in other parts of
North America, proceeds from two principal causes. In
the plains on this side of Platte river, from the custom
which the Indians who live here have adopted, to fire their
prairies towards the end of autumn, in order to have better
pasture at the return of spring; but in the Far West, where
the Indians do not follow this practice, (because they fear
to drive away the animals that are necessary for their subsistence,[Pg 215]
or to expose themselves to be discovered by the
strolling parties of their enemies,) it proceeds from the
nature of the soil, which being a mixture of sand and light
earth, is every where so very barren that with the exception
79 of the absynth[169] that covers the plains, and the
gloomy verdure that shades the mountains, vegetation is
confined to the vicinity of rivers,       a circumstance which
renders a journey through the Far West extremely long
and tedious.

At considerable distances, chiefly between the Kants
[Kansas] and the Platte rivers, are found blocks of granite
of different sizes and colors. The reddish is the most common.
In some of the stony parts of the Black Hills are
also seen numberless quantities of small pebbles of all
shades. I have seen some that were united into solid
masses. If these were well polished they would present
the appearance of fine mosaics. The columns of the House
of Representatives in Washington are deemed very handsome,
and are made of similar concretions.

On the feast of St. Peter a remarkable occurrence took
place. We discovered an equally curious quarry, which,
at first, we took for white marble, but we soon found it
something more valuable. Astonished at the facility with
which we could fashion this kind of stone into any shape,
most of the travellers made calumets of it. I had several
made myself, with the intention of offering them as presents
to the Indians, so that for the space of forty-eight
hours our camp was filled with lapidaries. But the greater
number of these calumets could not withstand the action of
the fire, and broke. It was alabaster.

The first rock which we saw, and which truly deserves
the name, was the famous Rock Independence. It is of[Pg 216]
the same nature as the Rocky Mountains. At first I was
led to believe that it had received this pompous name from
its isolated situation and the solidity of its basis; but I
was afterwards told that it was called so because the first
travellers who thought of giving it a name, arrived at it on
the very day when the people of the United States celebrate
the 80 anniversary of their emancipation from
Great Britain. We reached this spot on the day that
immediately succeeds this celebration. We had in our
company a young Englishman, as jealous of the honor of
his nation as the Americans; hence we had a double reason
not to cry hurra for Independence. Still, on the following
day, lest it might be said that we passed this lofty monument
of the desert with indifference, we cut our names on
the south side of the rock, under initials (I. H. S.) which
we would wish to see engraved on every spot. On account
of all these names, and of the dates that accompany them,
as well as of the hieroglyphics of Indian warriors, I have
surnamed this Rock "the Great Record of the Desert."
I shall add a few remarks about the mounds that are seen
in the vicinity of the Platte river. The most remarkable
of all, at least that which is best known to the generality
of travellers, is the mound to which they have given the
name of "chimney." It is called so on account of its
extraordinary form; but instead of applying to it an appellation
which is rather unworthy this wonder of nature,
just because it bears some resemblance to the object after
which it is named, it would have been more proper to call
it "the inverted funnel," as there is no object which it
resembles more. Its whole height, including the base, body
and column, is scarce less than four or five hundred feet; the
column or chimney is only about one hundred and thirty
feet high, so that there is nothing striking in the loftiness
of its dimensions. But what excites our astonishment, is[Pg 217][Pg 218][Pg 219]
the manner in which this remnant of a mountain, composed
of sand and clay, has been so shaped, and how it has for
such a length of time preserved this form, in spite of the
winds that are so violent in these parts. It is true that this
mound, and all those that are found near it, is composed
of a successive number 81 of horizontal and perpendicular
strata, and has about the middle a zone or belt, consisting
of a vein of petrified clay. If from these two facts it
would be inferred that at a certain height the substance of
which the horizontal and perpendicular strata are formed,
is susceptible of being hardened so as to approach the
nature of stone, then we might perhaps account in some
manner for the wonderful formation of this curious ornament.
Yet the main difficulty would still remain, and we
would at last be compelled to have recourse to the system
of occult qualities. The existence of the chimney is
therefore a problem, and if any scientific person should
wish to solve it, I would advise him to repair to this monument
without delay, as a cleft which is seen at the top,
and which in all probability will soon extend to the base,
threatens to leave nothing of it but the remembrance of
its existence.[170]


   
   
   Chimney


The chimney is not the only remarkable mound to be
met with in this vast solitude. There are many others of
various forms. One is called "the House," another "the
Castle," a third "the Fort,"      c. And, in fact, if a traveller
was not convinced that he journeys through a desert,
where no other dwellings exist but the tents put up at night
and removed in the morning, he would be induced to
believe them so many ancient fortresses or Gothic castles
and with a little imagination, based upon some historical[Pg 220]
knowledge, he might think himself transported amid the
ancient mansions of Knight errantry. On one side are
seen large ditches, and high walls; on the other, avenues,
gardens and orchards; farther on, parks, ponds, and lofty
trees. Sometimes the fancy presents a castle of the middle
ages, and even conjures up the lord of the manor; but
instead of all these magnificent remains of antiquity, we
find only barren mounds on all sides, filled with cliffs formed
by the falling 82 of the waters, and serving as dens
to an infinite number of rattle snakes and other venomous
reptiles.[171]

After the Missouri, which in the Far West is what the
Mississippi is in the North, the finest rivers are the Kanzas,
the Platte, and the Eau Sucree. The first of these
falls into the Missouri, and receives the waters of a great
number of tributary streams. Of these tributaries we
counted as many as eighteen before we reached the Platte.
Hence we may infer that the country abounds in springs,
and that the soil is compact and covered with verdure.
The reverse may be said of the neighborhood of the Platte,
where springs and verdure are seldom seen. Even on the
mounds that run parallel to its banks, the waters that fall
from the clouds, upon a sandy and porous soil, run down
into the vallies. But the prairies that receive the overflowing
waters of the river are extremely fertile, and appear
beautiful in spring, being enamelled with a great variety of
flowers. The sight of the river itself is still more pleasing;
though in spite of all its beauties, it has, like the most
remarkable of its mounds, received a vulgar name. This
proceeds from the custom which some travellers have of
applying to objects the names of things with which they
are well acquainted. They have called it Platte or Flat[Pg 221]
river, on account of its width and shallowness; the former
often extending six thousand feet, whilst its depth is but
from three to five feet, and sometimes less. This want of
proportion destroys its utility. Canoes cannot be used to
ascend it, and if barges sometimes come down from Fort
La Ramee to the mouth, it is because they are so constructed
that they may be converted into sledges and
pushed on by the hands of men. The author of Astoria
has properly defined it "the most magnificent and most
useless of rivers." Abstraction made of its defects, nothing
can be more pleasing 83 than the perspective which
it presents to the eye; though besides the prairie flowers
and the ranunculus, its banks bear only the eglantine and
the wild vine; for on account of the fires made in the
autumn the lofty vegetation is entirely confined to the
islands that stud its surface. These islands are so numerous
that they have the appearance of a labyrinth of groves
floating on the waters. Their extraordinary position gives
an air of youth and beauty to the whole scene. If to this
be added the undulations of the river, the waving of the
verdure, the alternations of light and shade, the succession
of these islands varying in form and beauty, and the purity
of the atmosphere, some idea may be formed of the pleasing
sensations which the traveller experiences on beholding
a scene that seems to have started into existence fresh
from the hands of the creator. Fine weather is common
in this temperate climate. However, it happens sometimes,
though but seldom, that the clouds floating with
great rapidity open currents of air so violent, as suddenly
to chill the atmosphere and produce the most destructive
hail storms. I have seen some hailstones of the size of an
egg. It is dangerous to be abroad during these storms.
A Sheyenne Indian was lately struck by a hailstone, and
remained senseless for an hour. Once as the storm was[Pg 222]
raging near us, we witnessed a sublime sight. A spiral
abyss seemed to be suddenly formed in the air. The
clouds followed each other into it with such velocity, that
they attracted all objects around them, whilst such clouds
as were too large and too far distant to feel its influence
turned in an opposite direction. The noise we heard in
the air was like that of a tempest. On beholding the conflict
we fancied that all the winds had been let loose from
the four points of the compass. It is very probable that
if it had approached much nearer, the whole caravan
84 would have made an ascension into the clouds, but the
Power that confines the sea to its boundaries and said       "Hitherto
shalt thou come," watched over our preservation.
The spiral column moved majestically towards the
North, and alighted on the surface of the Platte. Then,
another scene was exhibited to our view. The waters,
agitated by its powerful action, began to turn round with
frightful noise, and were suddenly drawn up to the clouds
in a spiral form. The column appeared to measure a mile
in height; and such was the violence of the winds which
came down in a perpendicular direction, that in the twinkling
of an eye the trees were torn and uprooted, and their
boughs scattered in every direction.[172] But what is violent
does not last. After a few minutes, the frightful visitation
ceased. The column, not being able to sustain the weight
at its base was dissolved almost as quickly as it had been
formed. Soon after the sun re-appeared: all was calm
and we pursued our journey. In proportion as we proceeded
towards the sources of this wonderful river, the
shades of vegetation became more gloomy, and the brows
of the mountains more cragged. Every thing seemed to
wear the aspect, not of decay, but of age, or rather of[Pg 223]
venerable antiquity. Our joy was extatic as we sung the
following Ode composed for the occasion:


Non ce n'est plus une ombre vaine,
Mes yeux ont vu, j'en suis certain,
Dans l'azur d'un brilliant lointain,
Des Monts Rocheux la haute chaine,      c.

O! no       it is no shadow vain,
That greets my sight       yon lofty chain
That pierces the ethereal blue;
The Rocky Mounts appear in view.

I've seen the spotless, virgin snow,
Glist'ning like gems upon their brow       
And o'er yon giant peak now streams
The golden light of day's first beams.

How from their ice-clad summits, steep,
The living waters joyous leap!
And gently on thro' vallies gay,
Sweeter than honey wend their way.

It is because on yon proud height,
The standard floats of life and light:
It is, that there th' Omnipotent
Hath pitched His everlasting tent       
The God whose love no tongue can tell,
Among his children deigns to dwell.

All hail! majestic Rock       the home
Where many a wand'rer yet shall come;
Where God himself, from His own heart
Shall health and peace and joy impart.

Sorrow adieu       farewell to fear,       
The sweet-voiced hymn of peace I hear;
Its tone hath touched the red-man's soul:
Lo! o'er his dark breast tear-drops roll.

O! soon the silent wilderness
Shall echo with his song of praise;
And infant lips, from morn till ev'n,
Shall chaunt thy love       great King of heav'n.

Father and God! how far above
All human thought, Thy wondrous love!
How strange the path by which Thy hand
Would lead the Tribes of this bleak land,
From darkness, crime and misery,
To live and reign in bliss with Thee!

[Pg 224]
As I have been speaking of rivers I shall give (you) a
short geographical description of the Missouri, which I am
86 inclined to call my river, as I have so often ascended
and descended it during the last four years, travelled along
its banks, and crossed almost all its tributaries from the
mouth of the Yellow Stone to the place where the mighty
river mingles its turbid stream with that of the peaceful
Mississippi. I have drunk the limpid waters of its sources,
and the muddy waters at its mouth, distant more than three
thousand miles from each other. The prodigious length
of its course, the wildness and impetuosity of its current
have induced the Scioux to call it "the furious." Whenever
I crossed this magnificent river the sensations which
I experienced bordered on the sublime, and my imagination
transported me through the world of prairies which
it fertilises, to the colossal mountains whence it issues. It
is in the heart of the Rocky Mountains that the Missouri
takes its rise, together with many other magnificent streams;
such as "the Father of Waters," into whose bosom it flows,
after having fertilised its own borders to a vast extent,       the
Arkansas, and the Red river, both, like itself, majestic
tributaries; the Columbia, which becomes the reservoir
of all the waters of the Oregon territory, and the Rio Colorado
which after winding its course through a gloomy
and rocky desert, invigorates the most beautiful part of
California. The Missouri, properly so called, is formed by
three considerable forks that unite their waters at the
entrance of one of the passes of the Rocky mountains. The
North fork is called "the Jackson," the South "the Gallatin,"
and the one between them "the Madison."[173] Each
one of these is subdivided into several small arms that flow[Pg 225]
from the mountains, and almost mingle their waters with
those of the upper forks of the Columbia on the western
side. I have drunk of both, distant only about fifty yards
from each other; for the same field of snow supplies both
the Atlantic 87 and Pacific oceans. After the junction of
the forks, the Missouri for a considerable distance, becomes
an impetuous and foaming torrent. Below this, its bed is
more spacious, and its course more tranquil. Steep rocks
of a black hue jut and rise above its current to a height of
nearly a thousand feet. The mountains, along whose base it
runs, are shaded by pines, cedars, fir and turpentine trees.
Some of these mountains present a solitary aspect, and
wear a look of unspeakable grandeur. The river, for the
space of seventeen miles, is seen raging and foaming, rolling
from cataract to cataract with a roaring noise that is
repeated by all the neighboring echoes. The first of these
cataracts measures ninety-eight feet in height; the second,
nineteen; the third, forty-seven, and the fourth, twenty-six.
Below the Falls, the beautiful river of Mary,[174] flowing
from the North, adds its peaceful waters to those of the
rapid and impetuous stream. Still lower, but on the opposite
side, the Dearborn and the Fancy disembogue themselves
through mouths respectively 150 feet in width.[175]
After many other rivers of considerable width and extent,
we come to the Yellow Stone, the largest but one of all the
tributaries of the Missouri, and resembling the latter in
many respects. This river too has its source in the Rocky
Mountains, and is 850 yards wide at its mouth; its bed is
spacious, its current rapid; its length is about 1600 miles,[Pg 226]
and at its confluence with the Missouri it appears to be the
larger of the two. For a considerable distance above the
mouth its banks are well wooded, and its bottom lands are
extensive and very fertile.[176] The grey and black bear, the
big horn, the antelope, the stag and the common deer frequent
these regions, whilst coal and iron mines are in such
abundance that for 50 years they might supply fuel and
materials to a countless number of steam engines.

88 After the Missouri has received the Yellow Stone
river, its bottom lands become more extensive; yet as little
or no wood is found on them, it may be long before
attempts will be made to cultivate them. The White Earth
river coming from the North, and the Goose river from the
South, are not very considerable. The width of each at
the mouth is 300 yards. The Little Missouri, though shallow,
has a rapid current, and has its sources in the South,
as also the following streams:[177] Cane river, near the village
of the Mandans; Cannon Ball river, Winnipenhu,
Sewarzena and Sheyenne river, which is navigable for 400
miles; a rapid and muddy stream, 400 yards at the mouth;[178]
Teton river and White river, so called on account of the
color of its waters, which are unwholesome. It is navigable
for 300 miles, has a rapid current, and measures about
300 yards at its mouth. The lands which it waters in the
upper country are barren, and abound in animal and vegetable
petrifactions, whilst its banks have every where a
fantastic appearance.[179] Next and on the same side we[Pg 227]
meet the Poncas and Running Water river, the latter of
which has a fine current. Medicine and Jacques rivers
enter the Missouri from the opposite side; the latter is
also called the rendezvous of the beaver hunters and runs
nearly parallel with the Missouri.[180] After the White Stone
and the Vermillion, we find the Big Scioux river, on which
is found the fine red stone quarry explored by the Indians
to make their calumets. The Floyd and the Roger, the
Maringoin, the Nishnebatlana and the Nedowa fall into
the Missouri on the Northern side.[181] Its chief tributary,
the Platte, rises like itself in the Rocky Mountains
and extends its course nearly two thousand miles. Though
it be a mile wide at the mouth yet it is shallow, as its name
indicates, and is not navigable, the two Nemahas flow from
the South and the Little 89 Platte from the North.[182] The
Kanzas, on the South side, is about a thousand miles long,
and is navigable to a great distance. Grand river, from
the North, is a wide, deep and navigable stream. The two
Charetons are found on the same side, whilst the Osage
and Gasconade rivers enter from the South. The former
is an important stream, navigable for 600 miles, and having
its sources near the waters of the Arkansas; whilst the
latter, though navigable only for 66 miles, is equally important,[Pg 228]
on account of the fine large pine forests that supply St.
Louis and the adjacent country with lumber. I shall say
nothing of the many other less remarkable tributaries of
the Missouri, such as the Blue Water, the Mine, the Bonne
Femme, the Manitoo, the Muddy, the Loutre, the Cedar,
the Buffalo, the St. Johns, the Wood river, the Charette,
Bonhomme, Femme Osage,      c.[183] The length of the
Missouri, from its sources to the Yellow Stone, is 880 miles,
from the Yellow Stone to its junction with the Mississippi,
is about 2200. I subjoin a list of the Forks of its great
tributaries which I have seen and crossed.

Beaver Head, Big Hole Fork, Stinking Water, Forks
of the Jefferson, Powder River, Tongue River, Rose-bud
River, Big Horn River, Clarke River, Rocky River, Traverse
River, Loutre River, 25 Yard River, Gallatin River,
Wind River, Forks of the Yellow Stone. Horn River,
Wolf River, Bigwood River, North Fork River, South
Fork River, Cabin Pole River, Horse River, La Ramee,
Eau Sucree, Forks of the Platte. Grande Sableuse, Horse
Shoe River, St. Peter's River, Red River, Kennion River,
Deer River, The Torrent, Branches of the North Fork of
the Platte. Soldier's River, Ouaggerehoosse River, Vermillion
River, Black Vermillion River, Sick River, Knife
River, Blue Waters, Forks of the Kanzas. Mary's River,
90 Big Bone, Yungar River, Potatoes River, Grand
Fork, Forks of the Osage.

I left off my narrative on Sugar River, otherwise called
Eau Sucree; I must interrupt it to listen to the good tidings
that are brought from the mountains.


I remain, Rev. and Dear Father,
Your dutiful Son in Christ,

LETTER V


Fort Hall, August 16th, 1841.

Rev. and Dear Father Provincial:


It was on the eve of the beautiful festival of the assumption
that we met the vanguard of the Flat Heads. We met
under the happiest auspices, and our joy was proportionate.
The joy of the savage is not openly manifested       that
of our dear neophytes was tranquil; but from the
beaming serenity of their looks, and the feeling manner in
which they pressed our hands, it was easy to perceive that,
like the joy which has its source in virtue, theirs was heartfelt
and profound. What had they not done to obtain a
mission of "Black Gowns?" For twenty years they had
not ceased to supplicate the Father of mercies; for twenty
years, in compliance with the counsels of the poor Iroquois,
who had established 91 themselves in their tribe, they had
conformed, as nearly as they could, to our creed, our manners,
and even to our religious practices. In what Catholic
parish was the Sunday, for example, ever more religiously
observed?       During the ten years just elapsed, four deputations,
each starting from the banks of the Bitter Root, on
which they usually assembled, had courageously ventured
to St. Louis, over a space of 3,000 miles,       over mountains
and vallies, infested by Black Feet and other hostile tribes.

Of the first deputation, which started in 1831, three
died of diseases produced by the change of climate.[184] The
second embassy reached its destination; but owing to the
great want of missionaries in the Diocess of St. Louis,[Pg 230]
received nothing but promises. The third, which set out
in 1837, consisted of five members, all of whom were
unmercifully massacred by the Scioux.[185] All these crosses,
however, were insufficient to abate their zeal. In 1839,
they sent two Iroquois deputies, one of whom was named
Peter, and the other "Young Ignatius,"[186] to distinguish
him from another called "Old Ignatius." These they
earnestly advised to make still more pressing entreaties to
obtain the long sought blessing, a "Black Gown, to conduct
them to heaven." Their prayers were, at length,
heard, even beyond their hopes. One Black Gown was
granted, together with a promise of more, if necessary for
their greater good. While Peter returned in haste to the
tribe to acquaint them with the complete success of their
mission, Ignatius remained at Westport, to accompany
the promised missionary. I had the happiness to be that
missionary; I visited the nation, and became acquainted,
in person, with their wants, their dispositions, and the
necessities of the neighboring tribes. After an absence[Pg 231]
of a year, I was now returning to them no longer alone,
but with two Fathers, 92 three brothers, laborers and all
that was essential to the success of the expedition. They
themselves had travelled upwards of 800 miles to meet
us, and now, that we were together, both parties were full
of vigor and hope. What joy must not these good Indians,
at that moment, have experienced. Being unable, however,
to express their happiness, they were silent; their
silence surely could not be ascribed to a deficiency of intelligence
or a want of sentiment, for the Flat Heads are full
of feeling, and many are truly intelligent. These, too,
were the elite of the nation. Judge of it by what follows.

The chief of this little embassy portrayed himself in
the following address to his companions, a few days subsequently
on viewing the plan of the first hamlet: "My
dear children," said he, "I am but an ignorant and wicked
man, yet I thank the Great Spirit for the favors which he
has conferred on us,       (and entering here into an admirable
detail, he concluded thus:) Yes, my dear friends, my
heart has found content; notwithstanding my wickedness
I despair not of the goodness of God. Henceforth,
I wish to live only that I may pray; I will never abandon
prayer; (religion) I will pray until the end of my life, and
when I die I will commit myself into the hands of the
Author of life; if he condemn me, I shall submit to his
will, for I have deserved punishment; if he save me, I
shall bless him forever. Once more, then, my heart has
found content.       What shall we do to evince the love we
bear our fathers?" Here he made practical resolutions,
but I must hasten to commemorate the zeal of each of those
who formed the embassy.

Simon, who had been baptised the preceding year, was
the oldest of the nation, and was so burdened with the
weight of years, that even when seated, he needed a stick[Pg 232]
93 for his support. Yet, he had no sooner ascertained
that we were on our route to join the tribe, than mounting
his horse and mingling with the young warriors who were
prepared to go forth to meet us, he said: "My children,
I shall accompany you; if I die on the way, our Fathers,
at least, will know the cause of my death." During the
course of the journey, he repeatedly exhorted his companions:
"courage, my children," he would say, "remember
that we are going to the presence of our Fathers;" and
urging his steed forward, whip in hand, he led on his youthful
followers, at the rate of fifty miles per day.

Francis, a boy from six to seven years old, grandson of
Simon, was an orphan from the very cradle. Having
served at the altar, the preceding year, he would not be
refused permission to accompany his grandfather: his
heart told him that he was about to recover father and
mother, and enjoy all the happiness that loving parents
can bestow.

Ignatius, who had advised the fourth deputation, and
had been a member of it,       who had succeeded in his mission,
and introduced the first Black Gown into the tribe,       who
had just recently exposed himself to new dangers,
in order to introduce others, had crowned his zealous
exertions by running for days without eating or drinking,
solely that he might reach us the sooner.

Pilchimo, his companion and brother to one of the martyrs
of the third deputation, was a young warrior, already
reputed brave among the brave. The preceding year,
his presence of mind and his courage had saved seventy
of his brethren in arms from the fury of nearly nineteen
hundred Black Feet.[187]

Francis Xavier was the son of old Ignatius, who had
been the leader of the second and third deputation, and[Pg 233]
had 94 fallen a victim to his devotion to the cause of religion
and of his brethren. Francis Xavier had gone to St.
Louis at the age of ten, in the company of his courageous
father, solely that he might have the happiness of receiving
baptism. He had finally attached himself without
reserve to the service of the mission, and supplied our table
with a daily mess of fish.[188]

Gabriel, who was of mixed blood, but an adopted child
of the nation, was interpreter for the missionaries. Being
the first to join us on the banks of the Green river, he
merited the title of precursor of the Flat Heads. His
bravery and zeal had four times induced him to travel,
for our sakes, over a space of 400 miles, which separated
us from the great camp.

Such were they who now greeted us. Let them tell their
own story.

They had prayed daily to obtain for me a happy journey
and a speedy return. Their brethren continued in
the same good disposition; almost all, even children and
old men, knew by heart the prayers which I had taught
them the preceding year. Twice on every week day, and
three times on each Sunday, the assembled tribe recited
prayers in common. Whenever they moved their camp,
they carried with them, as an ark of safety, the box of
ornaments left in their custody. Five or six children,
whom I had baptised went to heaven during my absence;
the very morrow of my departure, a young warrior whom
I had baptised the day previous, died in consequence of
a wound received from the Black Feet about three months
before.       Another, who had accompanied me as far as
the fort of the Crows, and was as yet but a catechumen,[Pg 234]
died of sickness in returning to the tribe, but in such happy
dispositions that his mother was perfectly consoled for his
loss by the conviction 95 that his soul was in heaven. A
girl, about twelve years of age, seeing herself on the point
of dying, had solicited baptism with such earnestness that
she was baptised by Peter the Iroquois, and received the
name of Mary.       After having sung a canticle in a stronger
voice than usual, she died, saying: "Oh how beautiful!
I see Mary, my mother." So many favors from heaven
were calculated to instigate the malice of hell. The enemies
of salvation had accordingly attempted to sow the
cockle among the good grain, by suggesting to the chiefs
of the tribe that my conduct would be like that of so many
others, who, "once gone, had never returned." But the
great chief had invariably replied: "You wrong our father;
he is not double-tongued, like so many others. He has
said: 'I will return,' and he will return, I am sure." The
interpreter added that it was this conviction which had
impelled the venerable old man, notwithstanding his advanced
age, to place himself at the head of the detachment
bound for Green river; that they had arrived at the rendezvous
on the 1st of July, which was the appointed day;
that they had remained there till the 16th, and would have
continued to occupy the same position, had not the scarcity
of provisions obliged them to depart. He stated also
that the whole tribe had determined to fix upon some spot
as a site for a permanent village; that, with this view,
they had already chosen two places which they believed to
be suitable; that nothing but our presence was required
to confirm their determination; and they relied with such
implicit confidence on our speedy arrival, that the great
chief, on starting from Green river, had left there three
men to await us, advising them to hold that position until
no longer tenable.

[Pg 235]

Here, I have much to relate that is not less edifying than
serious; but before I enter upon the chapter of noble
actions, 96 I must conclude what I had commenced in
my preceding letter. But I feel bound, before all, to pay
Mr. Ermatinger, the captain of Fort Hall, the tribute of
gratitude which we owe him.[189]

Although a protestant by birth, this noble Englishman
gave us a most friendly reception. Not only did he
repeatedly invite us to his table, and sell us, at first cost,
or at one-third of its value, in a country so remote, whatever
we required; but he also added, as pure gifts, many
articles which he believed would be particularly acceptable.
He did more: he promised to recommend us to
the good will of the Governor of the honorable English
Company, who was already prepossessed in our favor;
and, what is still more deserving of praise, he assured us
that he would second our ministry among the populous
nation of the Snakes, with whom he has frequent intercourse.
So much zeal and generosity give him a claim
to our esteem and gratitude. May heaven return to him
a hundred fold the benefits he has conferred on us. It was
at Fort Hall that we took our final leave of the American
Colony, with which we had, till then, pursued the same
route.[190] It was previously to this, while we were yet at
Green river, that those who came to that wild region,[Pg 236]
merely for information or pleasure, had turned back, with
some fewer illusions than when they started out upon the
journey. They were five or six in number.[191] Among
them was a young Englishman, who had been our messmate
from St. Louis. In taking leave of us, this young
man, who was in many respects estimable, assured us that,
if providence should ever again throw us together, the
meeting would give him the highest satisfaction, and that
he would always be happy to do us all the service in his
power. He was of a good English family, and like most
of his countrymen, fond of travel: he had 97 already
seen the four quarters of the globe; but qui multum peregrinantur....
He cherished so many prejudices, however,
against the Catholic religion, that, despite all our
good wishes, we were of no service to him in the most
essential relation. We recommended him to our friends.
I have treasured up one of his beautiful reflections: "We
must travel in the desert to witness the watchful care of
Providence over the wants of man."

They who had started, purely with the design of seeking
their fortune in California, and were pursuing their
enterprise with the constancy which is characteristic of
Americans, had left us, but a few days before our arrival
at the fort, in the vicinity of the boiling springs which
empty into Bear river.[192] There now remained with us
but a few of the party, who had come to the fort in order
to revictual. Among the latter were the leader of the
Colony and a reputed deacon of the Methodist sect.[Pg 237][193]
Both were of a peaceable disposition, and manifested for
us the highest regard; but the former, like so many others,
being very indifferent as to religious matters, held as a
maxim, "that it was best to have no religion, or else to
adopt that of the country in which we live;" and wishing
to display his great Bible erudition, he in proof of his
paradox, cited as a text of St. Paul the ancient proverb:
Si fueris Romæ, Romano vivite more. The minister was
of the same opinion, but yet he wished some religion, it
being well understood that his was the best. I say his,
because he was neither a Methodist, a Protestant, nor a
Catholic       not even a Christian; he maintained that a Jew,
a Turk, or an Idolatar may be as agreeable as any
other in the sight of God. For the proof of his doctrine,
he relied (strange to say) on the authority of St. Paul, and
particularly on this text: Unus Dominus una fides. In
fact, these were the very words with which he 98 greeted
us, the first time we saw him, and which formed the subject
of a long valedictory discourse that he delivered in one
of the meeting houses of Westport, previous to his departure
for his western mission. By whom was he sent? We
have never ascertained. His zeal frequently induced him
to dispute with us; it was not difficult to show him that
his ideas, with the exception of one, were vague and fluctuating.
He acknowledged it himself; but after having
wandered from point to point, he always returned to his
favorite tenet, which, according to him, was the fundamental
principle of all true belief: "that the love of God
is the first of duties, and that to inculcate it we must be
tolerant." This was his strongest point of support, the
foundation of all his reasoning, and the stimulus of his zeal.
The term Catholic, according to him, was but another word[Pg 238]
for "love and philanthropy." He carried his absurdities
and contradictions so far, that he excited the hilarity
of the whole camp. His ingenuous simplicity was even
greater than his tolerance. For example, he once said to
me: "Yesterday one of the members of my persuasion
returned to me a book which I had lent him, stating that
it contained an exposition of the Roman creed." When
I asked him his opinion of it, he replied, "that the book
was full of errors;" yet it was an exposition of Methodist
principles that I had given him. "Witness," said he,
with emphasis, "the blinding influence of prejudice."

I had daily conversations with someone of the caravan,
and frequently with several. And although Americans
are slow to change their creed, we had the consolation
to relieve our travelling companions of a heavy load of
prejudice against our holy religion. They parted from us,
exhibiting signs of respect and veneration; nay, even of
preference for Catholicity. These controversies so completely
99 engrossed my mind, my heart and my senses,
that I arrived almost unconsciously on the banks of Snake
river. Here a great danger and a profitable lesson awaited
us; but before speaking of the adventures of our journey,
I shall conclude what remains to be related of the country
we traversed.

We halted with our narrative upon the shore of the
Sweet-water. This stream is one of the most beautiful
tributaries of the Platte. It owes its name, indeed, to the
purity of its waters. It is distinguished from its fellow
tributaries by the numerous wanderings of its current       a
proof that the fall of its bed is but slight. But suddenly
changing its course, we see or rather hear it rushing
impetuously through a long cleft in a chain of mountains.
These mountains, which harmonize well with the torrent,
exhibit the most picturesque scenes; travellers have[Pg 239][Pg 240][Pg 241]
named this spot the Devil's Entrance.[194] In my opinion,
they should have rather called it Heaven's Avenue, for if
it resembles hell on account of the frightful disorder which
frowns around it, it is still a mere passage, and it should
rather be compared to the way of heaven on account of
the scene to which it leads. Imagine, in short, two rows
of rocks, rising perpendicularly to a wonderful height, and,
at the foot of these shapeless walls, a winding bed,
broken, encumbered with trunks of trees, with rubbish,
and with timber of all dimensions; while, in the midst of
this chaos of obstacles, the roaring waves force a passage,
now rushing with fury, then swelling with majesty, and
anon spreading with gentleness, according as they find
in their course a wider or more straitened passage. Above
these moving and noisy scenes, the eye discerns masses of
shadow, here relieved by a glance of day, there deepening
in their gloom by the foliage of a cedar or pine, till finally,
as the sight travels 100 through the long vista of lofty galleries,
it is greeted by a distant perspective of such mild
beauty, that a sentiment of placid happiness steals upon
the mind. Such is the spectacle we admired at the distance
of nine or ten miles from the Rock Independence, on the
morning of 6th July. I doubt whether the solitude of the
Carthusian monastery, called La Grande Chartreuse, of
which so many wonders are related, can, at least at first
sight, offer greater attractions to him whom divine grace
has called to a contemplative life. As for me, who am not
called to such a state, at least exclusively, after an hour of
raptures, I began to understand the expression of the Carthusian
friar, pulchrum transeuntibus; and I hasten to
proceed.


   
   
   Devil's Gate


[Pg 242]
Hence we directed our course more and more towards
the heights of the Far West, ascending, some times clambering,
until we reached the summit, from which we discovered
another world.[195] On the 7th of July we were in
sight of the immense Oregon Territory. I will not presume
to add to the many pompous descriptions which
have been given of the spectacle now before us. I shall
say nothing either of the height, the number, or the variety
of those peaks, covered with eternal snows, which rear
their heads, with menacing aspect, to the heavens. Nor
will I speak of the many streams descending from them
and changing their course, with unexpected suddenness;
nor of the extreme rarification of the air with the consequent
effect upon objects susceptible of contraction, at so
great an elevation. All this is common; but to the glory
of the Lord, I must commemorate the imperious necessity
I experienced, of tracing his holy name upon a rock,
which towered pre-eminent amid the grandeur around.
May that ever adorable name be to travellers a monument
of our gratitude, and a pledge of salvation. Henceforth
we descended 101 towards the Pacific       first, by following,
then by crossing the Little and the Great Sandy
Rivers.[196] In the vicinity of the latter, as the Captain had
mistaken one road for another, the caravan wandered for
three days at random. I, myself, on a fine evening, strayed
from the rest. I thought myself entirely lost; how was[Pg 243]
I to act? I did what every sincere believer would have
done in the same circumstances, I prayed; and then urging
on my horse, I travelled several miles, when it struck
me that it would be prudent to retrace my steps. I did so
instantly, and it was fortunate, for the caravan was far behind.
I found it encamped; still ignorant however of its position,
and on a soil so arid that our jaded beasts were necessitated
to fast for the night. Days follow, but resemble
not each other; two days subsequently, we were surrounded
with abundance, filled with joy, all once more
united, and on the banks of a river not less celebrated
among the hunters of the west, than the shores of the Platte.
This river loses itself not far below, in clefts of rocks said
to be no less than two hundred miles in extent, among
which there are countless swarms of beavers, although the
trapper has never ventured to hunt them, on account of
the extreme peril of the enterprise. At a certain period
of the year, both trappers and Indians flock to this spot,
for the purpose of bartering all kinds of merchandise. It
was here, but eight years ago, the wagons that first undertook
to cross the Rocky Mountains,[197] found the Pillars
of Hercules, and it was here too that we found the messenger
of the Flat Heads, to whom I have already alluded.
This river is the Rio Colorado of the West.[198] ... We rested
two days upon its banks, with the company of Captain F.,
who had just returned from California.[199] What they told[Pg 244]
us concerning that distant country dissipated many illusions,
and caused 102 some of our companions, who travelled
for amusement, to return.

On the 20th of July we seriously thought of continuing
our journey. To a company like ours, it was not an easy
matter. The remembrance of the expedition of Bonneville
was still fresh in the minds of all; but our object was
not the same; we had no articles but such as were necessary.       They
could be transported conveniently only by
wagons. We placed all our confidence in God. We soon
crossed the river, and our equipage was seen coming in
all directions, over vallies and mountains. We were compelled
to clear a passage, some times in the middle of a
ravine, some times on the declivity of a rock, and frequently
through bushes. We travelled in this manner for ten
days, to reach Bear river, which flows through a wide and
beautiful valley, surrounded by lofty mountains and often
intersected by inaccessible rocks. We continued our march
through it during eight successive days. The river resembles
in its course the form of a horse shoe, and falls into
the great Salt lake, which has no communication with the
sea. On our way, we met several families of Soshonees
or Snake Indians, and Soshocos or Uprooters. They
speak the same language, and are both friends to the
whites. The only difference we could observe between
them, was that the latter were by far the poorer.[200] They
formed a grotesque group, such as is not to be seen in any
other part of the Indian territory. Represent to yourself
a band of wretched horses, disproportionate in all their[Pg 245][Pg 246][Pg 247]
outlines, loaded with bags and boxes to a height equal to
their own, and these surmounted by rational beings young
and old, male and female, in a variety of figures and
costumes, to which the pencil of a Hogarth or a Breugel
could scarcely do justice, and you will have an idea of
the scene we witnessed. One 103 of these animals,
scarcely four feet high, had for its load four large sacks of
dried meat, two on each side, above which were tied several
other objects, terminating in a kind of platform on the
back of the living beast; and, on the summit of the whole
construction, at a very high elevation, was seated cross-legged
on a bear skin a very old person smoking his calumet.
At his side, on another Rosinante,[201] was mounted
an old Goody, probably his wife, seated in the same manner
on the top of sacks and bags, that contained all sorts
of roots, dried beans and fruits, grains and berries; in
short, all such comestibles as the barren mountains and
the beautiful vallies afford. These they carried to their
winter encampment. Some times we have seen a whole
family on the same animal, each according to his age, the
children in front, the women next, and the men behind.
On two occasions I saw thus mounted, five persons, of
whom two at least had the appearance of being as able to
carry the poor horse as the horse was to support the weight
of these two Soshocos gentlemen.


   
   
   Soda Springs


Some places on the Bear river exhibit great natural
curiosities. A square plain of a few acres in extent presents
an even surface of fuller's earth of pure whiteness,
like that of marble, and resembling a field covered with
dazzling snow. Situated near this plain are a great many
springs, differing in size and temperature. Several of
them have a slight taste of soda, and the temperature of
these, is cold. The others are of a milk warm temperature,[Pg 248]
and must be wholesome; perhaps they are not inferior
to the celebrated waters of the Spa, or of the lime
springs in Belgium. I am inclined to believe so, though
I am not firm in the opinion; at all events, they are surrounded
by the mountains over which our wagons found
it so difficult to pass. I therefore invite neither sick nor
sound to test them. In the same 104 locality there is a
hole in the ground, out of which air and water escape alternately.
The earth for some distance around resounds like
an immense vault, and is apt to frighten the solitary traveller
as he passes along.[202]

It was here that we left Bear River. On the 14th of
August our wagons having proceeded ten hours without
intermission, arrived at the outlet of a defile which seemed
to us the end of the world. On our right and left were
frightful mountains; in our rear a road which we were by
no means tempted to retrace; in front a passage through
which rushed a torrent; but so small that the torrent itself
seemed with difficulty, to force its way.[203] Our beasts
of burthen were, for the first time, exhausted. Murmurs
arose against the captain, who, however, was imperturbable,
and as he never shrunk from difficulties, advanced
to reconnoitre the ground.[204] In a few moments he made
us a sign to approach; one hour after we had surmounted
every obstacle, for we had traversed the highest chain of
the Rocky Mountains and were nearly in sight of Fort Hall.[Pg 249]
On the evening previous to the departure of the
camp from the Soda Springs, I directed my course towards
the fort, to make a few necessary arrangements. The
young F. Xavier was my only companion. We were soon
involved in a labyrinth of mountains, and about midnight,
we were on the summit of the highest chain. My poor
guide, being able to see nothing through the darkness but
frightful precipices, was so pitifully embarrassed that after
veering about for a while, like a weather-cock, he confessed
himself lost. That was not a place, nor was it a
time, to wander at random; I, therefore, took, what I considered,
the only alternative, that of waiting for the morning
sun to extricate us from our embarrassment. Wrapped
up in my blanket and with my saddle for a pillow, I
stretched myself upon the rock, and 105 immediately fell
into a sound sleep. Early the next morning, we descended
by a small cleft in the rocks, which the obscurity of the
night had concealed and arrived on a plain watered by the
New Port, one of the tributaries of Snake River. We
trotted or gallopped over fifty miles in the course of the
day. The whole way presented evident remains of volcanic
eruptions; piles and veins of lava were visible in all
directions, and the rocks bore marks of having been in a
state of fusion. The river, in its whole length, exhibits
a succession of beaver ponds, emptying into each other by
a narrow opening in each dike, thus forming a fall of
between three and six feet. All these dikes are of stone,
evidently the work of the water and of the same character
and substance as the stalactites found in some caverns.[205]

We arrived late in the evening, within half a mile of the[Pg 250]
Fort, but being unable to see our way in the darkness, and
not knowing where we were, we encamped for the night
among the bushes, near the margin of a small brook.

I have the honor to be


Rev. Father Provincial,
Your most humble and obedient servant and son,
P. J. De Smet, S.J.





LETTER VI


Camp of the Big-Face, 1st Sept. 1841.

Rev. and Dear Father Provincial:


Nearly four months had elapsed since our departure
from Westport, when we met the main body of the nation
to which we had been sent. Here we found the principal
chiefs, four of whom had advanced a day's journey to welcome
us. They met us at one of the sources of the Missouri
called Beaver-Head, where we had encamped.[206]
Having crossed the small river under the direction of these
new guides we came to an extensive plain, at the western
part of which the Flat Heads lay encamped. This was
on the 30th of August, and it was only towards night that
we could distinctly discern the camp. A number of runners
who rapidly succeeded each other, informed us that
the camp was not far distant. Contentment and joy were
depicted on their countenances. Long before the Flat[Pg 251]
Head warrior, who is surnamed the Bravest of the Brave,
sent me his finest horse to Fort Hall, having strongly recommended
that no one should mount him before he was
presented to me. Soon after the warrior himself appeared,
distinguished by his superior skill in horsemanship, and
by a large red scarf, which he wore after the fashion of the
Marshals of France. He is the handsomest Indian warrior
of my acquaintance. He came with a numerous retinue.
We proceeded at a brisk trot, and were now but two
or three miles from the camp, when at a distance we decried
a warrior of 107 lofty stature. A number of voices
shouted Paul! Paul! and indeed it was Paul, the great
chief, who had just arrived after a long absence, as if by
special permission of God, to afford him the satisfaction
of introducing me personally to his people.[207] After mutual
and very cordial demonstrations of friendship, the
good old chief insisted upon returning to announce our
arrival. In less than half an hour all hearts were united
and moved by the same sentiments. The tribe had the
appearance of a flock crowding with eagerness around
their shepherd. The mothers offered us their little children,
and so moving was the scene that we could scarcely
refrain from tears. This evening was certainly one of the
happiest of our lives. We could truly say that we had
reached the peaceful goal. All previous dangers, toils
and trials, were at an end and forgotten. The hopeful
thought that we would soon behold the happy days of the
primitive Christians revive among these Indians, filled
our minds, and the main subject of our conversations became
the question: "What shall we do to comply with
the requisitions of our signal vocation?"

[Pg 252]

I engaged Father Point, who is skilled in drawing and
architecture, to trace the plan of the Missionary Stations.
In my mind, and still more in my heart, the material was
essentially connected with the moral and religious plan.
Nothing appeared to us more beautiful than the Narrative
of Muratori.[208] We had made it our Vade Mecum.
It is chiefly to these subjects that we shall devote our attention
for the future, bidding farewell to all fine perspectives,
animals, trees and flowers, or favoring them only with an
occasional and hasty glance.

From Fort Hall we ascended the Snake River, also
called Lewis' Fork, as far as the mouth of Henry's Fort.
This is unquestionably the most barren of all the mountain
108 deserts. It abounds in absynth, cactus, and all
such plants and herbs as are chiefly found on arid lands.[209]
We had to resort to fishing for the support of life, and our
beasts of burden were compelled to fast and pine; for
scarcely a mouthful of grass could be found during the[Pg 253]
eight days which it took us to traverse this wilderness. At
a distance we beheld the colossal summits of the Rocky
Mountains. The three Tetons were about fifty miles to
our right, and to the left we had the three mounds at a distance
of thirty miles.[210]

From the mouth of Henry's Fork we steered our course
towards the mountains over a sandy plain furrowed by
deep ravines, and covered with blocks of granite. We
spent a day and night without water. On the following
day we came to a small brook, but so arid is this porous
soil, that its waters are soon lost in the sand. On the
third day of this truly fatiguing journey we entered into a
beautiful defile, where the verdure was both pleasing and
abundant, as it is watered by a copious rivulet. We gave
to this passage the name of "the Father's Defile," and
to the rivulet that of St. Francis Xavier.[211] From the
Father's Defile, to the place of our destination, the country
is well watered, for it abounds with small lakes and
rivulets, and is surrounded by mountains, at whose base
are found numberless springs. In no part of the world
is the water more limpid or pure, for whatever may be
the depth of the rivers, the bottom is seen as if there
were nothing to intercept the view. The most remarkable
spring which we have seen in the mountains, is called
the Deer's lodge. It is found on the bank of the main
Fork of the Bitter Root or St. Mary's River; to this Fork
I have given the name of St. Ignatius.[212] This spring is[Pg 254]
situated on the top of a mound thirty feet high, in the middle
of a marsh. It is accessible 109 on one side only.
The water bubbles up, and escapes through a number
of openings at the base of the mound, the circumference
of which appears to be about sixty feet. The waters at
the base are of different temperatures: hot, lukewarm
and cold, though but a few steps distant from each other.
Some are indeed so hot that meat may be boiled in them.
We actually tried the experiment.


I remain, Rev. Father Provincial,
Yours,      c.

LETTER VII


St. Ignatius' River, 10th Sept. 1841.

Rev. and Dear Father Provincial:


I informed your Reverence that flowers are found in
abundance near the rock called the Chimney. Whilst we
were there Father Point culled one flower of every kind,
and made a fine nosegay in honor of the Sacred heart of
Jesus, on the day of the Feast. As we proceeded towards
the Black Hills, the flowers diminished in number, but
now and then we found some which we had not seen any
where. I have taken notice of many of them, for the
amusement of amateurs. Among such as are double,
the most common and those that are chiefly characterised
by the soil on which they grow, are to be found on this side[Pg 255]
the Platte River. The rose-colored lupine flourishes in
the plain contiguous to the Platte, as far as the Chimney.
Beyond it grows a medicinal plant, bearing a yellow flower
with five petals, called the prairie epinette; and still
farther on, where the soil is extremely barren, are seen
three kinds of the prickly-pear; the flowers of these are
beautiful, and known among Botanists by the name of
Cactus Americana. They have already been naturalized
in the flower gardens of Europe. The colors of the handsomest
roses are less pure and lively than the carnation of
this beautiful flower. The exterior of the chalice is adorned
with all the shades of red and green. The petals are evasated
like those of the lily. It is better 111 adapted than
the rose to serve as an emblem of the vain pleasures of
this nether world, for the thorns that surround it are more
numerous, and it almost touches the ground. Among
the Simples, the most elegant is the blue-bell of our gardens,
which however, far surpasses it by the beauty of its
form, and the nicety of its shades, varying from the white
to the deepest azure. Adam's Needle, found only on the
most barren elevation, is the finest of all pyramidals.
About the middle of its stem, which is generally about
three feet high, begins a pyramid of flowers, growing close
to each other, highly shaded with red, and diminishing
in size as they approach the summit, which terminates in
a point. Its foot is protected by a number of hard, oblong,
ribbed, and sharp leaves, which have given it the name of
Adam's Needle. The root is commonly of the thickness
of a man's arm, its color white, and its form resembling
that of the carrot. The Indians eat it occasionally and
the Mexicans use it to manufacture soap.[213] There are[Pg 256]
many other varieties of flowers some of them very
remarkable and rare even in America, which are still without
a name even among travellers. To one of the principal,
distinguished by having its bronzed leaves disposed
in such a manner as to imitate the chapter of a Corinthian
column, we have given the name of Corinthian. Another,
a kind of straw color, by the form of its stem, and its division
into twelve branches, brought to our minds the famous
dream of the Patriarch Joseph, and we have called it the
Josephine. A third, the handsomest of all the daisies
(Reines Marguerites) that I have ever seen, having a yellow
disk, with black and red shades, and seven or eight rays,
any of which would form a fine flower, has been named
by us the Dominical, not only because it appeared like
the Lady and Mistress of all the flowers around, but also
because we discovered it on Sunday.

112 Shrubs. The shrubs that bear fruit are few.
The most common are the currant and gooseberry of various
sizes and colors, the hawthorn, the rasberry, the wild
cherry and the service-berry. Currants, white, red, black
and yellow, grow every where along the mountains. The
best are found on the plains, where they are exposed to be
ripened by the sun. I have classed the wild cherry and
the service-berry among shrubs, because they are generally
of low growth and do not deserve the name of trees.
The service-berry (cornier) grows on a real shrub, and is
a delicious fruit, called by travellers the mountain pear,
though it bears no resemblance to the pear, its size being
that of a common cherry. The mountain cherry differs
much from the European cherry. The fruit hangs in
clusters around the branches, and is smaller than the wild[Pg 257]
cherry, whilst its taste and color, and the form of the
leaves are nearly the same as those of the latter. Cherries
and service-berries constitute a great portion of the
Indians' food whilst the season lasts, and they are dried
by them to serve for food in the winter. I may perhaps
mention other fruits, plants and roots, that grow spontaneously
in different parts of the Far West, and are used as
food by the Indians for want of better sustenance.

Flax is very common in the valleys between the mountains.
What must appear singular is that the root of it
is so fruitful that it will produce new stems for a number
of years       we examined one of them, and found attached
to it about 30 stems, which had sprung from it in former
years. Hemp is also found, but in very small quantities.

Trees. There are but few species of trees in the
regions which we lately passed. Scarcely any forests are
found on the banks of rivers, for which I have already
assigned a reason. On the plains we find bushes, and
now and then 113 the willow, the alder, the wax tree,
the cotton tree, or white poplar whose bark is used for
horse feed in winter, and the aspen whose leaves are
always trembling. Some Canadians have conceived a
very superstitious idea of this tree. They say that of its
wood the Cross was made on which our Saviour was
nailed, and that since the time of the crucifixion, its
leaves have not ceased to tremble! The only lofty trees
found on the mountains are the pine and the cedar which
is either white or red. The latter is chiefly used for
furniture, as it is the most resistible wood of the West.
There are several species of the pine: the Norwegian, the
resinous, the white, and the elastic, so called because the
Indians use it to make bows.

So great is the violence of the winds in the vicinity of
the Black Hills, that the cotton wood, which is almost[Pg 258]
the only tree that grows there, displays the most fantastic
shapes. I have seen some whose branches had been
so violently twisted that they became incorporated with
the trunk, and after this, grew in such strange forms and
directions that at a distance it was impossible to distinguish
what part of the tree was immediately connected
with the roots.

Birds. I shall say but little of the birds. They are
various in form, color and size; from the pelican and the
swan to the wren and the humming bird. Muratori,
speaking of the last, compares him to the nightingale,
and is astonished that such shrill and loud sounds should
proceed from so small a body. The celebrated author
must have been mistaken, unless the humming bird of
South America be different from that of the Rocky Mountains.
The latter does not sing but makes a humming
noise with his wings as he flies from flower to flower.

Reptiles. With respect to reptiles, they have been
frequently described, and I mention them only to give
thanks 114 to God, by whose Providence we have been
delivered from all such as are venomous, chiefly from the
rattle snake. Neither men nor beasts belonging to our
caravan have suffered from them, though they were so
numerous in places that our wagoners killed as many as
twelve in one day.

Insects abound in these regions. The ant has often
attracted the notice of naturalists. Some have seemed
to doubt whether the wheat stored up by this little insect
serves for winter provisions or for the construction of its
dwelling. No wheat grows in this country. Yet the ant
stores up small pebbles of the size and form of grains of
wheat, which inclines me to believe that they use both for
the construction of their cells. In either case the paternal
Providence of God is manifest. They display as[Pg 259]
much foresight in providing dwellings that are out of the
reach of humidity and inundations, as in laying up food
for future wants. It is probable, however, that here they
find food of another kind, and this might easily be ascertained.
Fleas are not known in the mountains, but there
is another sort of vermin nearly allied to it, to which I have
alluded in one of my former letters. And what shall I say
of musquitoes? I have suffered so much from them, that
I cannot leave them unnoticed. In the heart of the
prairie they do not trouble the traveller, if he keep aloof
from the shade, and walk in the burning sun. But at
nightfall they light on him, and hang on him till morning,
like leeches sucking his blood. There is no defence
against their darts, but to hide under a buffalo skin, or
wrap oneself up in some stuff which they cannot pierce,
and run the risk of being smothered.       When green or
rotten wood can be procured, they may be driven away
by smoke, but in such case the traveller himself is smoked,
and in spite of all he can do, his eyes are filled with tears.
As soon as the smoke ceases, they 115 return to the charge
till other wood is provided and thrown on the fire, so that
the traveller's sleep is frequently interrupted, which proves
very annoying after the fatigue of a troublesome journey.
Another species of insects, called brulots, are found by
myriads in the desert, and are not less troublesome than
the musquito. They are so small that they are scarcely
perceptible, and light on any part of the body that is uncovered,
penetrating even into the eyes, ears and nostrils.
To guard against them, the traveller, even in the warmest
weather, wears gloves, ties a handkerchief over his
forehead, neck and ears, and smokes a short pipe or a cigar
to drive them from his eyes and nostrils. The fire-fly is
a harmless insect. When they are seen in great numbers,
darting their phosphoric light through the darkness,[Pg 260]
it is a sure sign that rain is at hand. The light which
they emit is very brilliant, and appears as if it proceeded
from wandering meteors. It is a favorite amusement with
the Indians to catch these insects, and after rubbing the
phosphoric matter over their faces, to walk around the
camp, for the purpose of frightening children and exciting
mirth.

As our hunters were scarcely ever disappointed in finding
game, we have seldom had recourse to fishing; hence
our acquaintance with the finny race is rather limited.       On
some occasions, when provisions were becoming
scarce, the line had to supply the place of the gun. The
fish which we generally caught were the mullet, two kinds
of trout, and a species of carps. Once, whilst we lay
encamped on the banks of Snake river, I caught more
than a hundred of these carps in the space of an hour.
The anchovy, the sturgeon, and the salmon, abound in
the rivers of the Oregon Territory. There are six species
of salmon.[214] They come up the rivers towards the end
of April, and 116 after spawning, never return; but the
young ones go down to the sea in September, and it is
supposed that they re-enter the rivers the fourth year after
they have left them.

Quadrupeds. The Beaver seems to have chosen this
country for his own. Every one knows how they work,
and what use they make of their teeth and tail. What we
were told by the trappers is probably unknown to many.       When
they are about constructing a dam, they examine all
the trees on the bank, and choose the one that is most bent
over the water on the side where they want to erect their
fort. If they find no tree of this kind they repair to
another place, or patiently wait till a violent wind gives
the requisite inclination to some of the trees. Some of the[Pg 261]
Indian tribes believe that the beavers are a degraded race
of human beings, whose vices and crimes have induced the
Great Spirit to punish them by changing them into their
present form; and they think, after the lapse of a number
of years, their punishment will cease, and they will be
restored to their original shape. They even believe that
these animals use a kind of language to communicate their
thoughts to each other, to consult, deliberate, pass sentence
on delinquents,      c. The Trappers assured us that such
beavers as are unwilling to work, are unanimously proscribed,
and exiled from the Republic, and that they are
obliged to seek some abandoned hole, at a distance from
the rest, where they spend the winter in a state of starvation.[215]
These are easily caught, but their skin is far
inferior to that of the more industrious neighbors, whose
foresight and perseverance have procured them abundant
provisions, and a shelter against the severity of the winter
season. The flesh of the beaver is fat and savory. The
feet are deemed the most dainty parts. The tail affords
a substitute for butter. The skin is sold for nine or ten
dollars' 117 worth of provisions or merchandise, the
value of which does not amount to a single silver dollar.
For a gill of whiskey, which has not cost the trader more
than three or four cents, is sometimes sold for three or four
dollars, though the chief virtue which it possesses is to kill
the body and soul of the buyer. We need not wonder
then when we see that wholesale dealers in this poisonous
article realize large fortunes in a very short time, and that
the retailers, of whom some received as much as eight hundred
dollars per annum, often present a most miserable
appearance before the year expires. The Honorable Hudson[Pg 262]
Bay Company does not belong to this class of traders.
By them the sale of all sorts of liquors is strictly forbidden.

The Otter is an inhabitant of the mountain rivers. His
color is dark brown or black. Like the beaver, he is
incessantly pursued by the hunters, and the number of
both these animals is yearly diminished. Among other
amphibious animals we find two species of the frog. One
does not differ from the European, but the other offers
scarcely any resemblance. It has a tail and horns and is
only found on the most arid soil. By some of our travellers
it was called the Salamander.[216]

Opossums are common here. They are generally found
near marshes and ponds that abound in small crawfish, of
which they are extremely fond. To catch them he places
himself on the bank, and lets his long hairless tail hang
down in the water. The crawfish are allured by the bait,
and as soon as they put their claws to it, the opossum
throws them up, seizes them sideways between his teeth,
and carries them to some distance from the water, where
he greedily but cautiously devours his prey.

The Badger inhabits the whole extent of the desert; he
is seldom seen, as he retires to his hole at the least approach
118 of danger. Some naturalists refer this animal to the
genuine Ursus. Its size is that of the Dormouse; its color
silver grey; its paws are short, and its strength prodigious.
A Canadian having seized one as he entered the hole,
he required the assistance of another man to pull him out.

The Prairie Dog, in shape, color and agility, more resembles
the squirrel than the animal from which it has
taken its name. They live together in separate lodges, to
the number of several thousands. The earth which they
throw up to construct their lodges, forms a kind of slope[Pg 263]
which prevents the rain from entering the holes. At the
approach of man, this little animal runs into its lodge,
uttering a piercing cry, which puts the whole tribe on their
guard. After some minutes, the boldest show a part of
their heads, as if to spy the enemy, and this is the moment
which the hunter chooses to kill them. The Indians informed
us that they sometimes issue in a body, apparently
to hold a council, and that wisdom presides over
their deliberations. They admit to their dwellings the
bird of Minerva, the striped squirrel, and the rattlesnake,
and it is impossible to determine what is the cause of this
wonderful sympathy. It is said too that they live only on
the dew of the grass root, a remark founded upon the position
of their village, which is always found where the ground
is waterless and barren.

The Polecat or Memphitis Americana, is a beautifully
speckled animal. When pursued, it raises its tail, and
discharges a large quantity of fluid, which nature has intended
for its defence. It repeats these discharges in
proportion as the pursuer comes near it. So strong is the
f      tid odor of this liquid that neither man nor beast can
bear it. It happened once that Rev. Father Van Quickenborne[217]
119 saw two of these cats. He took them for
young cubs, and pleased with the discovery, he alighted
from his horse, and wished to catch them. He approached
them cautiously, and was just ready to put his large
hat over one of them, when all at once a discharge was
made that covered him all over. It was impossible to go[Pg 264]
near him       all around him was infected. His clothes
could no longer be used, and the poor man, though,
rather late, resolved never again to attempt to catch
young bears!

The Cabri (Antelope) resembles the deer in form and
size, the antlers are smaller and have but two branches;
the color of the animal resembles that of the stag; the eyes
are large and piercing; and its gait in the wilderness is
a kind of elegant gallop. Sometimes the Antelope stops
short and rears his head to observe his pursuer; this is
the most favorable moment to kill him. When started
or shot at and missed, he darts forward with incredible
swiftness, but curiosity induces him to halt and look back.
The hunter tries to amuse his curiosity, by holding up and
waving some bright colored object: the animal approaches,
and curiosity becomes the cause of his death. The
flesh is wholesome, and easily digested, but it is used only
where deer and buffalo meat are wanting. The Antelope
hunt is a favorite sport with the Indians. They choose
a spot of ground from fifty to eighty feet square, and enclose
it with posts and boughs, leaving a small opening
or entrance, two or three feet wide. From this entrance
they construct two wings or hedges, which they extend for
several miles.       After this they form a large semicircle,
and drive the Antelopes before them till they enter between
the hedges, where they press so hard upon them that they
force them into the square enclosure, in which they kill
them with clubs. I have been told that the number of
Antelopes thus driven 120 into the enclosure, often
amounts to more than two hundred. The meat of the
buffalo cow is the most wholesome and the most common
in the west. It may be called the daily bread of the
traveller, for he never loses his relish for it.       It is more
easily procured than any other, and it is good throughout.[Pg 265]
Though some prefer the tongue, others the hump, or some
other favorite piece, all the parts are excellent food. To
preserve the meat it is cut in slices, thin enough to be dried
in the sun; sometimes a kind of a hash is made of it, and
this is mixed with the marrow taken from the largest bones.
This kind of mixture is called Bull or Cheese, and is generally
served up and eaten raw, but when boiled or baked
it is of more easy digestion, and has a more savory taste
to a civilized palate. The form and size of the buffalo
are sufficiently known. It is a gregarious animal, and is
seldom seen alone. Several hundreds herd together, the
males on one side, the females on the other, except at a
certain season of the year. In the month of June we saw
an immense herd of them on the Platte.       The chase of
this animal is very interesting. The hunters are all
mounted; at the signal given, they fall upon the herd,
which is soon dispersed; each one chooses his own animal,
for he who slays the first is looked upon as the king of the
chase       his aim must be sure and mortal, for the animal,
when wounded, becomes furious, turns upon his hunter
and pursues him in his turn. We once witnessed a scene
of this kind. A young American had the imprudence
to swim over a river and pursue a wounded buffalo with
no other weapon but his knife. The animal turned back
upon him, and had it not been for the young Englishman,
whom I have already mentioned, his imprudence would
have cost him his life. The greatest feat of a hunter is to
drive the wounded animal to any place he thinks proper.
We had a 121 hunter named John Gray,[218] reputed one of
the best marksmen of the mountains; he had frequently[Pg 266]
given proofs of extraordinary courage and dexterity, especially
when on one occasion he dared to attack five bears
at once. Wishing to give us another sample of his valor,
he drove an enormous buffalo he had wounded, into the
midst of the caravan. The animal had stood about fifty
shots, and been pierced by more than twenty balls; three
times he had fallen, but fury increasing his strength, he
had risen, after each fall, and with his horns threatened
all who dared to approach him. At last the hunter took
a decisive aim, and the buffalo fell to rise no more.

The small chase is carried on without horses. An experienced
hunter, though on foot, may attack a whole herd
of buffalos; but he must be skilful and cautious. He
must approach them against the wind, for fear of starting
the game, for so acute is the scent of the buffalo that he
smells his enemy at a very considerable distance. Next,
he must approach them as much as possible without being
seen or suspected. If he cannot avoid being seen, he draws
a skin over his head, or a kind of hood, surmounted
by a pair of horns, and thus deceives the herd. When
within gun shot, he must hide himself behind a bank or
any other object. There he waits till he can take sure
aim. The report of the gun, and the noise made by the
fall of the wounded buffalo, astound, but do not drive
away the rest. In the meantime, the hunter re-loads his
gun, and shoots again, repeating the man      uvre, till five
or six, and sometime more buffalos have fallen, before he
finds it necessary to abandon his place of concealment.       The
Indians say that the buffalos live together as the
bees, under the direction of a queen, and that when the
queen is wounded, all the others surround and deplore her.
122 If this were the case, the hunter who had the good
fortune to kill the queen, would have fine sport in despatching
the rest. After death, the animal is dressed,[Pg 267]
that is, he is stripped of his robe, quartered and divided;
the best pieces are chosen and carried off by the hunter,
who, when the chase has been successful, is sometimes
satisfied with the tongue alone. The rest is left for the
wolves. These voracious prowlers soon come to the
banquet, except when the scene of slaughter is near the
camp. In such cases they remain at bay till night, when
all is still. Then they come to the charge, and set up such
howling that they frighten the inexperienced traveller.
But their yells and howlings, however frightful, have little
or no effect upon those whose ears have become accustomed
to such music. These sleep with as little concern as if
there were not a wolf in the country.

Of wolves we have seen four varieties, the grey, the
white, the black, and the bluish. The grey seems to be
the most common, as they are the most frequently seen.       The
black wolves are large and ferocious animals. They
sometimes mingle with a herd of buffalos, and at first
appear quite harmless, but when they find a young calf
strayed from its dam, or an old cow on the brink of a precipice,
they are sure to attack and kill the former, and to
harass the latter till they succeed in pushing it down the
precipice. The wolves are very numerous in these
regions       the plains are full of holes, which are generally
deep, and into which they retire when hunger does not
compel them to prowl about, or when they are pursued
by the huntsman. There is a small sized wolf, called the
medicine wolf, regarded by the Indians as a sort of Manitou.
They watch its yelpings during the night, and the
superstitious conjurers pretend to understand and 123
interpret them. According to the loudness, frequency,
and other modifications of these yelpings, they interpret
that either friends or foes approach the camp,      c., and
if it happens that on some other occasion they conjecture[Pg 268]
right, the prediction is never forgotten, and the conjurers
take care to mention it on every emergency.

There are also four kinds of bears, distinguished by the
colors: white, black, brown and grey. The white and
grey bears are what the lion is in Asia, the kings of the
mountains: they are scarcely inferior to the lion in form
and courage. I have sometimes joined in the chase of this
animal, but I was in good company       safe from danger.       Four
Indian hunters ran around the bear and stunned
him with their cries       they soon despatched him. In less
than a quarter of an hour after this, another fell beneath
their blows. This chase is perhaps the most dangerous;
for the bear, when wounded, becomes furious, and unless
he be disabled, as was the case in the two instances mentioned,
he attacks and not unfrequently kills his pursuers.
Messrs. Lewis and Clarke, in their expedition to the sources
of the Missouri, adduce a striking proof of the physical
strength of this animal, which shows that he is a most
formidable enemy. One evening, the men who were in
the hindmost canoe, discovered a bear, crouched in the
prairie, at a distance of about three hundred yards from
the river. Six of them, all skilful hunters, left the canoe,
and advanced to attack him. Protected by a little eminence,
they approached without being perceived, till they
were but forty steps from the animal. Four of the men
discharged their guns, and each one lodged a ball in his
body       two of the balls had pierced the lungs. The bear,
frantic with rage, starts up and rushes upon his enemies,
with wide extended jaws. As he approached, the two
hunters who had kept 124 their fire, inflicted two wounds
on him; one of the balls broke his shoulder, which for a
few moments retarded his progress, but before they could
re-load their guns, he was so close upon them that they
had to run with the greatest speed to the river. Here he[Pg 269]
was at the point of seizing them       two of the men threw
themselves into the canoe, the four others scattered and
hid themselves among the willows, where they loaded and
fired with the greatest expedition. They wounded him
several times, which only served to increase his fury; at
last he pursued two of them so closely, that they were compelled
to provide for their safety by leaping into the river
from a perpendicular bank nearly twenty feet high. The
bear followed them, and was but a few feet from them,
when one of the hunters who had come from his lurking
place, sent a ball through his head and killed him. They
dragged him to the shore, and there ascertained that not
less than eight balls passed through his body.[219]

I remain, Rev. and dear Father Provincial,

LETTER VIII



Hell Gate,[220] 21st Sept. 1841.

Rev. and Dear Father Provincial:


It is on a journey through the desert that we see how
attentive Providence is to the wants of man. I repeat
with pleasure this remark of my young Protestant friend,
because the truth of it appears through the narrative which[Pg 270]
I have commenced, and will appear still more evidently
in what is to follow. Were I to speak of rivers, the account
would be long and tedious, for in five days we
crossed as many as eighteen, and crossed one of them five
times in the space of a few hours. I shall only mention
the most dangerous among them. The first, which we
found it very difficult to cross, was the South Fork of the
Platte. But as we had been long apprised of the difficulty,
we took our precautions before hand, and some of
our Canadians had explored it with so much care, that
we forded it, not without great difficulty, but without any
serious accident. The greatest distress was felt by the
dogs of the caravan. Left on the bank, when all had
crossed, nothing but fidelity towards their masters could
have induced them to swim over a river but little less than
a mile wide, and having so rapid a current that it would
have carried away wagons and carts, had they not been
supported on all sides, while the mules exerted all their
strength to pull them onward. The poor dogs did not
attempt to cross till they found that there was no medium
left between encountering the danger and 126 losing their
masters. The passage over these rivers is generally
effected by means of a bull boat, the name given to a kind
of boat, constructed on the spot with buffalo hides. They
are indispensable when the current is impetuous, and no
ford can be found. Thanks to our Canadians, we wanted
them neither on this nor any other occasion.[221]


   
   
   Fording the river Platte


The second difficult passage was over the North Fork,
which is less wide, but deeper and more rapid than the
Southern. We had crossed the latter in carts. Having
mustered a little more courage, we determined to cross
the North Fork on horseback. We were induced to do[Pg 271][Pg 272][Pg 273]
so, on seeing our hunter drive before him a horse on which
his wife was mounted, whilst at the same time he was pulling
a colt that carried a little girl but one year old. To
hold back under such circumstances would have been a
disgrace for Indian Missionaries. We therefore resolved
to go forward. It is said that we were observed to grow
pale, and I am inclined to believe we did; yet, after our
horses had for some time battled against the current, we
reached the opposite shore in safety, though our clothes
were dripping wet. Here we witnessed a scene, which,
had it been less serious, might have excited laughter. The
largest wagon was carried off by the force of the current,
in spite of all the efforts, shouts and cries of the men, who
did all they could to keep themselves from being drowned.
Another wagon was literally turned over. One of the
mules showed only his four feet on the surface of the water,
and the others went adrift entangled in the gears. On one
side appeared the American captain, with extended arms,
crying for help. On the other, a young German traveller
was seen diving with his beast, and soon after both
appearing above water at a distance from each other. Here
a horse reached the shore without a rider; further on, two
127 riders appeared on the same horse; finally, the good
brother Joseph dancing up and down with his horse, and
Father Mengarini clinging to the neck of his, and looking
as if he formed an indivisible part of the animal.
After all our difficulties, we found that only one of the
mules was drowned. As the mule belonged to a man who
had been the foremost in endeavoring to save both men
and horses, the members of the caravan agreed to make
him a present of a horse, as a reward for his services. We
offered thanks to God for our escape from danger. I mentioned
before that great dangers awaited us on Snake
river. This stream being much less deep and wide than[Pg 274]
the other two, and having such limpid waters that the
bottom can every where be seen, could only be dangerous
to incautious persons. It sufficed to keep our eyes
open, for any obstacle could easily be distinguished and
avoided. But whether it were owing to want of thought
or attention, or to the stubborn disposition of the team,
Brother Charles Huet found himself all at once on the
border of a deep precipice, too far advanced to return.
Down went mules, driver and vehicle, and so deep was
the place, that there scarcely appeared any chance to save
them. Our hunter, at the risk of his life, threw himself
into the river, to dive after the poor brother, whom he had
to pull out of the carriage. All the Flat Heads who were
with us, tried to save the vehicle, the mules and the baggage.
The baggage, with the exception of a few articles,
was saved; the carriage was raised by the united efforts
of all the Indians, and set afloat; but after this operation
it was held by but one of them, he found that his strength
was inadequate to the task, and crying that he was being
drowned, let go his hold. The hunter plunged in after
him, and was himself at the point of losing his life, on
account of the efforts 128 which the Indian made to
save his own. Finally, after prodigies of valor, exhibited
by all the Flat Heads, men, women and children, who all
strove to give us a proof of their attachment, we lost what
we considered the most safe, the team of the carriage.
The gears had been cut to enable the mules to reach the
shore, but it is said that these animals always perish when
once they have had their ears under water. Thus we lost
our three finest mules. This loss was to us very considerable,
and would have been irreparable, had it not been
for the kindness of Captain Ermatinger. Whilst the people
of the caravan were drying our baggage, I returned
to the Fort, where the generous Captain repaired our loss[Pg 275][Pg 276][Pg 277]
for a sum truly inconsiderable, when compared with what
must be paid on such occasions to those who wish to avail
themselves of the misfortunes of others. We had escaped
the danger, and were besides taught a very useful lesson,
for it was remarked that it was the first day since we began
our journey, on which, by reason of the bustle occasioned
by our departure from the Fort, we had omitted to say
the prayers of the itinerary.


   
   
   Sheyenne Warriors


We had dangers of another description to encounter,
from which we were also delivered by the aid of God's
grace. Once as we travelled along the banks of the
Platte, several members of the caravan separated from
the main body, contrary to the expressed orders of the
Captain, who, together with Father Point and myself,
had started a little ahead to look out for a place of encampment.
We succeeded in finding a proper site, and we
had already unsaddled our horses, when all at once we
heard the alarm cry: the Indians! the Indians! And
in fact, a body of Indians, appearing much larger than it
really was, was seen in the distance, first assembling
together, and then coming full 129 gallop towards our
camp. In the mean time a young American, unhorsed
and unarmed, makes his appearance, complaining of the
loss he had sustained, and indignant at the blows he had
received. He seizes the loaded rifle of one of his
friends, and rushes forward to take signal vengeance on
the offender. The whole camp is roused; the American
youth is determined to fight; the Colonel orders the
wagons to be drawn up in double file, and places between
them whatever may be exposed to plunder. All preparations
are made for a regular defence. On the other
hand, the Indian squadron, much increased, advances and
presents a formidable front. They man      uvre as if they
intend to hem in our phalanx, but at sight of our firm[Pg 278]
position, and of the assurance of the Captain who advanced
towards them, they checked their march, finally halted,
and came to a parley, of which the result was that
they should return to the American whatever they had
taken from him, but that the blows which he had received
should not be returned. After this, both parties united
in smoking the calumet. This band consisted of 80 Sheyenne
warriors, armed for battle. The Sheyennes are
looked upon as the bravest Indians in the prairie. They
followed our camp for two or three days. As the chiefs
were admitted to our meals, both parties separated with
mutual satisfaction.[222]

On another occasion we were in company with the vanguard
of the Flat Heads, and had penetrated into an
impassible defile between the mountains, so that after
having travelled the whole day, we were forced to retrace
our steps. At night the rumor was spread that a party
of Banac Indians lay encamped in the neighborhood.[223]
The Banacs had this very year killed several white men;
but it soon appeared that they were more frightened than
ourselves, for before day break they had removed from
the place.

130 Without being aware of it, we had escaped a much
greater danger on the banks of Green River. We did
not know the particulars of this danger till after we had
arrived at Fort Hall. There we heard that almost immediately
after our separation from the travellers who were
on their way to California, and with whom we had till[Pg 279]
then lived as brothers, they divided themselves into two
bands, and each band again subdivided into two
parties, one to attend to the chase, the other to guard the
horses. The hunter's camp was guarded only by five or
six men and some women, who had also to keep watch
over the horses and baggage of the others. A booty so
rich and so much exposed could not but tempt the Indians
who roamed in the neighborhood, and waited, as is their
custom, till a seasonable opportunity should offer to commence
the attack. When least expected, they fell first
upon the horses, and then upon the tents, and though the
guardians made a courageous defence, and sold their lives
dearly, yet they burned and pillaged the camp, taking
away whatever might be serviceable to them; thus giving
a terrible lesson to such as expose themselves to lose
all, by not remaining united to withstand the common
enemy.[224]

But a few days after we had received this sad intelligence
we ourselves were much alarmed. We apprehended
lest we should have to defend our lives against a
large body of Black Feet Indians, whose warriors continually
infest the country through which we were then travelling.
It was reported that they were behind the mountain,
and soon 131 after that they were in sight. But
our brave Indians, glowing with the desire to introduce
us to their tribe, were undaunted, and would have
attacked them, had they been a hundred times more
numerous. Pilchimo, brandishing his musket in the air,
started off with the greatest rapidity, and was followed
by three or four others. They crossed the mountain and[Pg 280]
disappeared, and the whole camp made ready to repel
the assailants. The horses were hitched and the men
under arms, when we saw our brave Indians return over
the mountain, followed by a dozen others. The latter
were Banacs, who had united rather with a mind to fly
than to attack us. Among them was a chief, who showed
the most favorable dispositions. I had a long conference
with him on the subject of religion, and he promised
that he would use all his endeavors to engage his men to
adopt religious sentiments. Both he and his retinue left
us the day after the arrival of the Flat Heads, who came
to wish us joy for the happy issue of our long journey.
We here remarked how the power of reason acts upon the
heart of the savage. The Banac chief was brother to
an Indian of the tribe who had been killed by one of the
Flat Head chiefs present on this occasion. They saluted
each other in our presence and separated as truly Christian
warriors would have done, who show enmity to each
other only on the field of battle. Yet as the Flat Heads
had more than once, been basely betrayed by the Banacs,
the former did not offer to smoke the calumet. I hope
that we shall have no difficulty to bring on a reconciliation.
The Flat Heads will undoubtedly follow the advice
we shall give them, and I feel confident that the Banacs
will be satisfied with the conditions.


I have the honor to be
Rev. and dear Father Provincial,
Your devoted servant and son,
P. J. De Smet, S.J.

LETTER IX


St. Mary's, 18th October, 1841.

Rev. and Dear Father:


After a journey of four months and a half on horseback
through the desert, and in spite of our actual want
of bread, wine, sugar, fruit, and all such things as are
called the conveniences of life, we find our strength and
courage increased, and are better prepared than ever to
work at the conversion of the souls that Providence entrusts
to our care. Next to the Author of all good things,
we returned thanks to her whom the church reveres as the
Mother of her Divine Spouse, since it has pleased the
Divine goodness to send us the greatest consolations on
several days consecrated to her honor. On the feast of
her glorious Assumption we met the vanguard of our dear
neophytes. On the Sunday within the Octave, we, for
the first time since my return, celebrated the Holy Mysteries
among them. On the following Sunday our good
Indians placed themselves and their children under the
Immaculate Heart of Mary, of which we then celebrated
the feast. This act of devotion was renewed by the great
chief in the name of his whole tribe, on the feast of her
Holy Name. On the 24th of September, the feast of our
Lady of Mercy, we arrived at the river called Bitter Root,
on the banks of which we have chosen the site for our
principal missionary station.[225] On the first Sunday of[Pg 282]
October, feast of the Rosary, we took possession of the
promised land, by planting a cross on the spot which 133
we had chosen for our first residence. What motives
of encouragement does not the Gospel of the present Sunday
add to all these mentioned before. To-day too we
celebrate the Divine Maternity, and what may we not
expect from the Virgin Mother who brought forth her
Son for the salvation of the world. On the feast of her
Patronage we shall offer by her mediation to her Divine
Son, twenty-five young Indians, who are to be baptized on
that day. So many favors have induced us unanimously
to proclaim Mary the protectress of our mission, and give
her name to our new residence.[226]

These remarks may appear silly to such as attribute
every thing to chance or necessity, but to such as believe
in the wise dispensations of the Providence of God, by
which all things are governed and directed, all these circumstances,
together with the wonderful manner in which
we have been called, sent and led to this new mission;
and still more the good dispositions manifested by the
Indians, will appear very proper motives to inspire us
with fresh courage, and with the hope of establishing
here, on a small scale, the order and regularity which once
distinguished our missions in Paraguay. This hope is
not founded on imagination, for whilst I am writing
these lines, I hear the joyful voices of the carpenters, re-echoing
to the blows on the smith's anvil, and I see them
engaged in raising the house of prayer. Besides, three
Indians, belonging to the tribe called Pointed Hearts,[Pg 283][227]
having been informed of our arrival among the Flat
Heads, have just come to entreat us to have pity on them.
"Father," said one of them to me, "we are truly deserving
your pity. We wish to serve the Great Spirit, but we
know not how. We want some one to teach us. For
this reason we make application to you." O had some
of my brethren, now so far distant from us, been present
here last Sunday, when towards night we raised the
134 august sign of salvation, the standard of the cross,
in this small but zealous tribe; how their hearts would
have been moved on seeing the pious joy of these children
of the forest! What sentiments of faith and love did they
exhibit on this occasion, when headed by their chief, they
came to kiss the foot of the cross, and then prostrate on
their knees, made a sacred promise, rather to suffer death
a thousand times, than to forsake the religion of Jesus
Christ! Who knows how many of this chosen band may
be destined to become apostles and martyrs of our holy
religion! Were we more numerous, I feel confident that
many other tribes would become members of the kingdom
of God; perhaps more than two hundred thousand
might be converted to Christ.[228] The Flat Heads and the
Pointed Hearts, it is true are not numerous tribes, but
they are surrounded by many others who evince the best
dispositions. The Ponderas or Pends-d'oreilles are very
numerous, and live at a distance of four or five days journey[Pg 284]
from our present establishment. The chief who governed
them last year and who has been baptized and called
Peter, is a true apostle.[229] In my first visit to them I
baptized two hundred and fifty of their children. Many
other tribes have the same origin, and though differing
in name, their languages are nearly allied. Next to these
are found the Spokans,[230] who would soon follow the example
of the neighboring tribes; the Pierced Noses, who
are disgusted at the conduct of the Protestant ministers
that have settled among them; the Snakes, the Crows
and the Banacs whose chief we have seen. Last year I
visited the Sheyennes, whom I twice met on the banks of
the Platte; the numerous nation of the Scioux, and the
three allied tribes called Mandans, Arickarees and Minatarees,
who all have given me so many proofs of respect
and friendship; the Omahas, with whom I have had so
many conferences on 135 the subject of religion, and
many others who seem inclined to embrace the truth.

The Black Feet are the only Indians of whose salvation
we would have reason to despair, if the ways of God
were the same as those of man, for they are murderers,
thieves, traitors, and all that is wicked. But were not the
Chiquitos, the Chiriquans,[231] the Hurons, and the Iroquois
equally wicked before their conversion, which required
much time and great help from above? And is it not to
the last, that, under God, the Flat Heads owe their desire
of becoming members of his church, and the first germs
of the copious fruit that has been produced among them?[Pg 285]
What is more, the Black Feet are not hostile to Black
Gowns. We have been assured by other Indians that we
would have nothing to fear, if we presented ourselves
amongst them as ministers of religion. When last year
I fell into the hands of one of their divisions, and it was
ascertained that I was an interpreter of the Great Spirit,
they carried me in triumph on a buffalo robe to their village,
and invited me to a banquet, at which all the great men
of the tribe assisted. It was on this occasion, that, whilst
I said grace, I was astonished to see that they struck the
earth with one hand and raised the other towards heaven,
to signify that the earth produces nothing but evil, whilst
all that is good comes from above. From all this you
will easily conclude that the harvest is great, whilst the
laborers are few.

It is the opinion of the Missionaries who accompany
me, and of the travellers I have seen in the Far West, in
short, of all those who have become acquainted with the
Flat Heads, that they are characterised by the greatest
simplicity, docility and uprightness. Yet, to the simplicity
of children is joined the courage of heroes. They
never begin the attack, but wo to such as provoke them
or treat 136 them unjustly. A handful of their warriors
will not shrink from an enemy twenty times more numerous
than they; they will stand and repel the assault, and
at last put them to flight, and make them repent their
rashness. Not long before my first arrival among them,
seventy men of the tribe, finding themselves forced to
come to an engagement with a thousand Black Feet
warriors, determined to sustain the attack, and rather to
die than retreat. Before the engagement they prostrated
themselves and addressed such prayers as they had learned
to the Great Spirit. They rose full of courage, sustained
the first shock, and soon rendered the victory doubtful.[Pg 286]
The fight, with several interruptions, was continued five
successive days, till at last the Black Feet, astounded at
the boldness of their antagonists, were panic struck, and
retreated from the scene of action, leaving many killed
and wounded on the field of battle, whilst not one warrior
of the Flat Heads was killed. But one died of the wounds
he had received, and his death happened several months
after the engagement, on the day succeeding his baptism       (though
the point of an arrow had pierced his skull.)
It was on the same occasion that Pilchimo, whom I have
already mentioned, gave remarkable proofs of valor and
attachment to his fellow warriors. All the horses were
on the point of falling into the enemy's hand. Pilchimo
was on foot. Not far off was a squaw on horseback; to see
the danger, to take the squaw from her horse and mount
it himself, to gallop to the other horses, and bring them
together, and drive them into the camp, was the affair of
a few minutes. Another warrior, named Sechelmeld, saw
a Black Foot separated from his company, and armed with
a musket.[232] The Black Foot, taking the warrior for one
of his own tribe, asked the Flat Head to let him mount
behind him. The latter wishing to 137 make himself
master of the musket, agreed to the proposal. They
advance on the plain, till Sechelmeld seeing that the place
favored his design, seizes his fellow rider's weapon,
exclaiming; "Black Foot! I am a Flat Head, let go your
musket." He wrests it from his hands, despatches him,
remounts the horse, and gallops off in pursuit of the enemy.

The following feat equally deserves to be recorded: A
Black Foot warrior was taken and wounded whilst in the
act of stealing a horse. The night was dark and the wound
had rendered him furious. He held his loaded gun, and[Pg 287]
threatened death to any one that should approach him.
Peter, one of the chiefs already mentioned, though diminutive
in size, and far advanced in years, felt his courage
revived; he runs up to the enemy, and with one blow fells
him to the ground. This done he throws himself on his
knees, and raising his eyes towards heaven, he is reported
to have said: "Great Spirit! thou knowest that I did
not kill this Black Foot from a desire of revenge, but
because I was forced to it; be merciful to him in the other
world. I forgive him from the bottom of my heart all the
evils which he has wished to inflict upon us, and to prove
the sincerity of my words I will cover him with my garments."
This Peter was baptized last year, and became
the apostle of his tribe. Even before baptism, his simplicity
and sincerity prompted him to give this testimony of
himself: "If ever I have done evil it was through ignorance,
for I have always done what I considered good."
It would be tedious to give an account of his zealous
endeavors. Every morning, at an early hour, he rides
through the whole village, stops at every hut, speaks a few
words of encouragement and reproof, as circumstances
require, and exhorts all to be faithful in the performance
of their religious and social duties.

138 I have spoken of the simplicity and the courage
of the Flat Heads; I shall make some other remarks concerning
their character. They little resemble the majority
of the Indians, who are, generally speaking, uncouth,
importunate, improvident, insolent, stubborn and cruel.       The
Flat Heads are disinterested, generous, devoted to
their brethren and friends; irreproachable, and even
exemplary, as regards probity and morality. Among
them, dissensions, quarrels, injuries and enmities are
unknown. During my stay in the tribe last year, I have
never remarked any thing that was contrary to modesty[Pg 288]
and decorum in the manners and conversation of the men
and women. It is true that the children, whilst very young,
are entirely without covering, but this is a general custom
among the Indians, and seems to have no bad effect upon
them; we are determined, however, to abolish this custom
as soon as we shall be able to do it. With respect to religion,
the Flat Heads are distinguished by the firmness of
their faith, and the ardor of their zeal. Not a vestige of
their former superstitions can be discovered. Their confidence
in us is unlimited. They believe without any difficulty
the most profound mysteries of our holy religion, as
soon as they are proposed to them, and they do not even
suspect that we might be deceived, or even could wish to
deceive them. I have already mentioned what exertions
they have made to obtain Black-gowns for their tribe; the
journeys, undertakings, the dangers incurred, the misfortunes
suffered to attain their object. Their conduct
during my absence from them has been truly regular and
edifying. They attend divine service with the greatest
punctuality, and pay the most serious attention to the
explanation of the Catechism. What modesty and fervent
piety do they not exhibit in 139 their prayers, and with
what humble simplicity they speak of their former blindness,
and of such things as tend to reflect honor upon
their present conduct. On this last subject their simplicity
is truly admirable: "Father," some will say, with down
cast eyes, "what I tell you now I have never mentioned
to any one, nor shall I ever mention it to others; and if I
speak of it to you, it is because you wish and have a
right to know it."

The chiefs, who might be more properly called the
fathers of the tribe, having only to express their will, and
are obeyed, are always listened to, and are not less remarkable
for their docility in our regard than for the ascendancy[Pg 289]
they possess over their people. The most influential
among them, surnamed "The Little Chief," from the
smallness of his stature, whether considered as a Christian
or a warrior, might stand a comparison with the most renowned
character of ancient chivalry.[233] On one occasion,
he sustained the assaults of a whole village, which, contrary
to all justice, attacked his people. On another occasion,
when the Banacs had been guilty of the blackest
treason, he marched against them with a party of warriors
not one-tenth the number of their aggressors. But, under
such a leader, his little band believed themselves invincible,
and invoking the protection of heaven, rushed upon the
enemy, and took signal vengeance of the traitors, killing
nine of their number. More would have been killed,
had not the voice of Little Chief arrested them in the very
heat of the pursuit, announcing that it was the Sabbath,
and the hour of prayer. Upon this signal, they gave
over the pursuit, and returned to their camp. Arrived
there, they immediately, without thinking of dressing
their wounds, fell upon their knees in the dust, to render
to the Lord of Hosts the honor of the victory. Little
Chief had received a ball 140 through the right hand,
which had entirely deprived him of its use; but seeing
two of his comrades more severely wounded than himself,
he with his other hand rendered them every succor
in his power, remaining the whole night in attendance
upon them. On several other occasions, he acted with
equal courage, prudence and humanity, so that his reputation
became widely spread. The Nez-perces, a nation far
more numerous than the Flat Heads, came to offer him
the dignity of being their Great Chief. He might have
accepted it without detriment to the rights of any one,
as every Indian is free to leave his chief, and place himself[Pg 290]
under any other head he may think proper, and, of
course, to accept any higher grade that may be offered
to him. But Little Chief, content with the post assigned
him by Providence, refused the offer, however honorable
to him, with this simple remark, "By the will of the Great
Master of life I was born among the Flat Heads, and if
such be His will, among the Flat Heads I am determined
to die;"       a patriotic feeling, highly honorable to him.
As a warrior, still more honorable to his character are
the mildness and humility manifested by him. He said
to me, once: "Till we came to know the true God, alas,
how blinded were we! We prayed, it is true       but to
whom did we address our prayers? In truth, I know
not how the Great Spirit could have borne with us so long."
At present his zeal is most exemplary; not content with
being the foremost in all the offices at chapel, he is always
the first and last at the family prayers, and even before
break of day he is heard singing the praises of his Maker.
His characteristic trait is mildness; and yet he can assume
due firmness, not to say severity of manner, when he sees
it necessary to exercise more rigorous discipline. Some
days before our arrival, one of the young 141 women
had absented herself from prayer, without a sufficient
reason. He sent for her, and after reading her a lecture
before all the household, enforced his motives for greater
attention in future, by a smart application of the cane.
And how did the young offender receive the correction?
With the most humble and praiseworthy submission.

The Flat Heads are fond of praying. After the regular
evening prayer, they will assemble in their tents to pray
or sing canticles. These pious exercises will frequently
be prolonged till a late hour; and if any wake during the
night, they begin to pray. Before making his prayer, the
good old Simeon gets up and rakes out the live coals upon[Pg 291]
his hearth, and when his prayer is done, which is always
preceded and followed by the sign of the cross, he smokes
his calumet and then turns in again. This he will do three
or four times during the night. There was a time, also,
when these more watchful spirits of the household, not
content with praying themselves, would awaken the sleepers,
anxious to make them partakers of the good work.       These
pious excesses had sprung from a little piece
of advice I had given them on my first visit, that "on waking
at night it was commendable to raise the heart to God."
It has since been explained to them how they are to understand
the advice. This night, between the 25th and 26th,
the prayers and canticles have not ceased. Yesterday,
a young woman having died who had received baptism
four days previously, we recommended them to pray for
the repose of her soul. Her remains were deposited at
the foot of the Calvary, erected in the midst of the camp.
On the cross upon her grave might confidently be inscribed
the words: In spem Resurrectionis       In hope of a glorious
Resurrection. We shall shortly have to celebrate the
commemoration 142 of the faithful departed; this will
afford us an opportunity of establishing the very Christian
and standing custom of praying for the dead in their place
of interment.

On Sundays, the exercises of devotion are longer and
more numerous, and yet they are never fatigued with the
pious duty. They feel that the happiness of the little
and of the humble is to speak with their Heavenly Father,
and that no house presents so many attractions as the
house of the Lord. Indeed, so religiously is the Sunday
observed here, that on this day of rest, even before our
coming, the most timorous deer might wander unmolested
in the midst of the tribe, even though they were reduced
by want of provisions to the most rigorous fast. For, in[Pg 292]
the eyes of this people, to use the bow and arrow on this
day, would not have appeared less culpable than did the
gathering of wood to the scrupulous fidelity of the people
of God.       Since they have conceived a juster idea of the
law of grace, they are less slaves to "the letter that killeth;"
but still desirous to be faithful to the very letter, they are
studious to do their best, and when any doubt arises, they
hasten to be enlightened thereon, soliciting in a spirit of
faith and humility that permission of which they may think
themselves to stand in need.

The principal chief is named "Big Face," on account
of the somewhat elongated form of his visage; he might
more nobly and more appropriately be named The Nestor
of the Desert, for as well in years as in stature and sagacity
he has all the essentials of greatness. From his earliest
infancy, nay, even before he could know his parents, he
had been the child of distress. Being left a helpless orphan,
by the death of his mother, with no one to protect him, it
was proposed to bury him with her in the same grave       a
circumstance that may serve to give some idea of the
ignorance and brutality of his tribe. But the Almighty,
who had 143 other purposes in his regard, moved the
heart of a young woman to compassionate his helpless
condition, and offer to become a mother to him. Her
humanity was abundantly recompensed by seeing her
adopted son distinguished above all his fellows by intelligence,
gentleness, and every good disposition. He was
grateful, docile, charitable, and naturally so disposed to
piety, that, from a want of knowing the true God, he more
than once was led to place his trust in that which was but
the work of his own hands.       Being one day lost in a forest,
and reduced to extremity, he began to embrace the trunk
of a fallen tree, and to conjure it to have pity upon him.
Nor is it above two months since a serious loss befell him;[Pg 293]
indeed one of the most serious that could happen to an
Indian       the loss of three calumets at the same time.
He spent no time in retracing his steps, and to interest
heaven in his favor, he put up the following prayer: "Oh
Great Spirit, you who see all things and undo all things,
grant, I entreat you, that I may find what I am looking
for; and yet let thy will be done." This prayer should
have been addressed to God. He did not find the calumets,
but in their place he received what was of more incomparable
value       simplicity, piety, wisdom, patience, courage,
and cool intrepidity in the hour of danger. More favored
in one respect than Moses, this new guide of another people
to God, after a longer sojournment in the wilderness,
was at length successful in introducing his children into
the land of promise. He was the first of his tribe who
received baptism, and took the name of Paul, and like
his patron, the great Apostle, he has labored assiduously
to gain over his numerous children to the friendship and
love of his Lord and Master.

LETTER X


St. Mary's, Rocky Mountains, 26th Oct. 1842.[234]

Rev. and Dear Father Provincial:


This last letter will contain the practical conclusions
of what has been stated in the preceding. I am confident
that these conclusions will be very agreeable and
consoling to all persons who feel interested in the progress
of our holy religion, and who very prudently refuse to form[Pg 294]
a decided opinion, unless they can found it on well attested
facts.

From what has hitherto been said, we may draw this
conclusion, that the nation of the Flat Heads appear to be
a chosen people       "the elect of God;" that it would be
easy to make this tribe a model for other tribes,       the
seed of two hundred thousand Christians, who would be
as fervent as were the converted Indians of Paraguay;
and that the conversion of the former would be effected
with more facility than that of the latter. The Flat Heads
have no communication with corrupt tribes; they hold
all sects in aversion; they have a horror of idolatry; they
cherish much sympathy for the whites, but chiefly for the
Black Gowns, (Catholic Priests) a name, which, in consequence
of the prepossessions and favorable impressions,
which they have received from the Iroquois, is synonymous
with goodness, learning, and Catholicity. Their position
is central.       Their territory sufficiently extensive to
contain several missions; the land is fertile, the country
surrounded by 145 high mountains. They are independent
of all authority except that of God, and those
who represent him. They have no tribute to pay but that
of prayer; they have already acquired practical experience
of the advantages of a civilized over a barbarous state
of life; and in fine, they are fully convinced and firmly
persuaded that without the religion that is announced to
them, they can be happy neither in this world nor in the
next.

From all these considerations, we may again draw the
conclusions, that the best end which we can propose to
ourselves is that which our Fathers of Paraguay had in
view when they commenced their missionary labors; and
that the means to attain this end should be the same,
chiefly because these means have been approved by the[Pg 295]
most respectable authorities, crowned with perfect success,
and admired even by the enemies of our religion.

The principle being admitted, it only remains to form
a correct idea of the method employed by our Fathers in
Paraguay to improve the minds and hearts of their Neophytes,
and to bring them to that degree of perfection of
which they conceived them susceptible. After having
seriously reflected on what Muratori relates of the establishments
in Paraguay, we have concluded that the
following points should be laid down, as rules to direct
the conduct of our converts.

1. With regard to God.       Simple, firm, and lively faith
with respect to all the truths of religion, and chiefly such
as are to be believed as Theologians express it, necessitate
medii et necessitate præcepti. Profound respect for
the only true religion; perfect submission to the church
of God, in all that regards faith and morality, discipline,
     c. Tender and solid piety towards the Blessed Virgin
146 and the Saints. Desire of the conversion of others.
Courage and fortitude of the Martyrs.

2. With regard to our neighbor.       Respect for those in
authority, for parents, the aged,      c. Justice, charity, and
generosity towards all.

3. With regard to one's self.       Humility, modesty, meekness,
discretion, temperance, irreproachable behavior, industry
or love of labor,      c.

We shall strenuously recommend the desire of the conversion
of others, because Providence seems to have great
designs with respect to our small tribe. In one of our
instructions given in a little chapel, constructed of boughs,
not less than twenty-four nations were represented, including
ourselves. Next, the courage and fortitude of the
Martyrs, because in the neighborhood of the Black Feet
there is continual danger of losing either the life of the soul,[Pg 296]
or that of the body. Also, industry or the love of labor,
because idleness is the predominant vice of Indians; and
even the Flat Heads, if they are not addicted to idleness,
at least, manifest a striking inaptitude to manual labor,
and it will be absolutely necessary to conquer this.       To
ensure success, much time and patience will be required.
Finally and chiefly, profound respect for the true religion,
to counteract the man      uvres of various sectaries, who,
desirous as it would seem, to wipe away the reproach
formerly made by Muratori, and in our days by the
celebrated Dr. Wiseman,[235] use all their efforts to make
proselytes, and to appear disinterested, and even zealous
in the propagation of their errors.

4. With regard to the means.       Flight from all contaminating
influence; not only from the corruption of the age,
but from what the gospel calls the world. Caution against
147 all immediate intercourse with the whites, even with
the workmen, whom necessity compels us to employ, for
though these are not wicked, still they are far from possessing
the qualities necessary to serve as models to men
who are humble enough to think they are more or less perfect,
in proportion as their conduct corresponds with that
of the whites. We shall confine them to the knowledge of
their own language, erect schools among them, and teach
them reading, writing, arithmetic and singing. Should
any exception be made to this general rule, it will be in
favor of a small number, and only when their good dispositions
will induce us to hope that we may employ them as
auxiliaries in religion. A more extensive course of instruction[Pg 297]
would undoubtedly prove prejudicial to these good
Indians, whose simplicity is such that they might easily
be imposed upon, if they were to come in contact with
error, whilst it is the source of all truth and virtue when
enlightened by the flambeau of faith. La Harpe himself,
speaking of the Apostolic laborers of our society, says
that the perfection of our ministry consists in illumining
by faith the ignorance of the savage.[236]

To facilitate the attainment of the end in view, we have
chosen the place of the first missionary station, formed the
plan of the village, made a division of the lands, determined
the form of the various buildings,      c. The buildings
deemed most necessary and useful at present are, a
church, schools, work houses, store houses,      c. Next,
we have made regulations respecting public worship, religious
exercises, instructions, catechisms, confraternities,
the administration of the Sacraments, singing, music,      c.
All this is to be executed in conformity with the plan formerly
adopted in the Missions of Paraguay.

Such are the resolutions which we have adopted, and
148 which we submit to be approved, amended or modified,
by those who have the greater glory of God at heart,
and who, by their position and the graces of their state of
life, are designed by the Most High to communicate to us
the true spirit of our Society.


Believe me to be,
Rev. and dear Father Provincial,
Your devoted son in Christ,
P. J. De Smet, S.J.




[Pg 298]



LETTER XI


St. Mary's, December        , 1841.

Reverend Father:


I shall here give you the remarks and observations I have
made, and the information I have gathered, during this last
journey, concerning some customs and practices of the
savages.

In speaking of the animals, I inquired of seven Flat Heads,
who were present, how many cows they had killed between
them in their last hunt? The number amounted to one
hundred and eighty-nine       one alone had killed fifty-nine.
One of the Flat Heads told me of three remarkable hits
which had distinguished him in that chase. He pursued a
cow, armed merely with a stone, and killed her by striking
her while running, between the horns; he afterwards killed
a second with his knife; and finished his exploits by spearing
and strangling a large ox. The young warriors frequently
exercise themselves in this manner, to show their agility,
dexterity and strength. He who spoke looked like a Hercules.
They then, (a rare favor, for they are not boasters,)
kindly showed me the scars left by the balls and arrows of
the Black Feet in their different encounters. One of them
bore the scars of four balls which had pierced his thigh;
the only consequence of which was a little stiffness of the
leg, scarcely perceptible. Another had his arm and breast
pierced by a ball. A third, beside some wounds from a
knife and spear, had an arrow, five inches 150 deep, in his
belly. A fourth had still two balls in his body. One
among them, a cripple, had his leg broken by a ball sent
by an enemy concealed in a hole; leaping on one leg he
fell upon the Black Foot, and the hiding place of the foe[Pg 299]
became his grave. "These Black Feet," I remarked, "are
terrible people." The Indian who last spoke replied in the
sense of the words of Napoleon's grenadier, "Oui, mais ils
meurent vite apres." I expressed a desire to know the medicines
which they use in such cases; they, much surprised at
my question, replied, laughing, "we apply nothing to our
wounds, they close of themselves." This recalled to me the
reply of Captain Bridger in the past year. He had had,
within four years, two quivers-full of arrows in his body.
Being asked if the wounds had been long suppurating, he
answered in a comical manner, "among the mountains
nothing corrupts."[237]

The Indians who live on Clarke river are of the middle
size.[238] The women are very filthy. Their faces, hands[Pg 300]
and feet are black and stiff with dirt. They rub them every
morning with a composition of red and brown earth mixed
up with fish oil. Their hair, always long and dishevelled,
serves them for a towel to wipe their hands on. Their garment
is generally tattered, and stiff and shining with dust
and grease. They seem to be less subjected to slavish labor
than the squaws that live East of the Mountains, still they
have to toil hard, and to do whatever is most difficult.
They are obliged to carry all the household furniture or to
row the canoe when they move from one place to another
at home, they fetch the wood and the water, clean the fish,
prepare the meals, gather the roots and fruits of the season,
and when any leisure time is left, they spend it in making
mats, baskets and hats of bull-rushes. What must appear
rather singular is, 151 that the men more frequently handle
the needle than the squaws. Their chief occupations, however,
are fishing and hunting. These Indians suffer much
from ophthalmic affections. Scarcely a cabin is to be found
on Clarke river, in which there is not a blind or one eyed person,
or some one laboring under some disease of the eye.
This probably proceeds from two causes       first, because
they are frequently on the water and exposed from morning
till night to the direct and reflected rays of the sun, and next,
because living in low cabins made of bull-rushes, the large
fire they make in the centre fills it with smoke, which must
gradually injure their eyes.

Conjurers are found here as well as in some parts of[Pg 301]
Europe. They are a kind of physicians. Whatever may
be the complaint of the patient these gentlemen have him
stretched out on his back, and his friends and relatives are
ordered to stand round him, each one armed with two sticks
of unequal length. The doctor or conjurer neither feels the
pulse nor looks at the tongue, but with a solemn countenance
commences to sing some mournful strain, whilst those
present accompany him with their voices and beat time
with the sticks. During the singing the doctor operates on
the patient, he kneels before him, and placing his closed fists
on the stomach, leans on him with all his might. Excessive
pain makes the patient roar, but his roarings are lost in the
noise, for the doctor and the bystanders raise their voices
higher in proportion as the sick man gives utterance to his
sufferings. At the end of each stanza the doctor joins his
hands, applies them to the patient's lips, and blows with all
his strength. This operation is repeated till at last the doctor
takes from the patient's mouth, either a little white stone,
or the claw of some bird or animal, which he exhibits to the
bystanders, protesting that he has 152 removed the cause
of the disease, and that the patient will soon recover. But
whether he recover or die, the quack is here as elsewhere
rewarded for his exertions. Mundus vult decipi, is the
watchword of quacks, jugglers and mountebanks; and it
seems that the Indian conjurers are not unacquainted with
it. I received this description of their method of curing
diseases from a clerk of the Hudson Bay Company. I shall
subjoin another anecdote concerning the religious ideas
entertained by the Tchenooks.[239] All men, they say, were
created by a divinity called Etalapasse, but they were created
imperfect or unfinished. Their mouths were not cleft, their
eyes were closed, and their hands and feet were immovable;
so that they were rather living lumps of flesh than men.[Pg 302]
Another divinity, whom they call Ecannum (resembling the
Nanaboojoo of the Potowattamies,) less powerful, but more
benevolent than the former, seeing the imperfect state of
these men, took a sharp stone and with it opened their
mouths and eyes. He also gave motion to their hands and
feet. This merciful divinity did not rest satisfied with conferring
these first favors on the human race. He taught
them to make canoes and paddles, nets and all the implements
now used by the Indians. He threw large rocks into
the rivers to obstruct their courses, and confine the fish in
order that the Indians might catch them in larger quantities.

When I speak of the Indian character, I do not mean to
include the Indians that live in the neighborhood of civilized
man, and have intercourse with him. It is acknowledged
in the United States, that the whites who trade with
those Indians, not only demoralize them by the sale of
spirituous liquors, but communicate to them their own vices,
of which some are shocking and revolting to nature. The
Indian left to himself, is circumspect and discreet in his
153 words and actions. He seldom gives way to passion;
except against the hereditary enemies of his nation. When
there is question of them, his words breathe hatred and
vengeance. He seeks revenge, because he firmly believes
that it is the only means by which he can retrieve his honor
when he has been insulted or defeated; because he thinks
that only low and vulgar minds can forget an injury, and
he fosters rancor because he deems it a virtue. With respect
to others, the Indian is cool and dispassionate, checking the
least violent emotion of his heart. Thus should he know
that one of his friends is in danger of being attacked by an
enemy lying in wait for him, he will not openly tell him so,
(for he would deem this an act of fear,) but will ask him
where he intends to go that day, and after having received
an answer, will add with the same indifference, that a wild[Pg 303]
beast lies hidden on the way. This figurative remark
will render his friend as cautious as if he were acquainted
with all the designs and movements of the enemy. Thus
again, if an Indian has been hunting without success, he
will go to the cabin of one of his friends, taking care not to
show the least sign of disappointment or impatience, nor
to speak of the hunger which he suffers. He will sit down
and smoke the calumet with as much indifference as if he had
been successful in the chase. He acts in the same manner
when he is among strangers. To give signs of disappointment
or impatience, is looked upon by the Indians as a mark
of cowardice, and would earn for them the appellation of
"old woman," which is the most injurious and degrading
epithet that can be applied to an Indian. If an Indian be
told that his children have distinguished themselves in
battle,       that they have taken several scalps, and have carried
off many enemies and horses, without giving the least
sign of joy, he will answer: "They have done 154 well."
If he be informed that they have been killed or made
prisoners, he will utter no complaint, but will simply say:
"It is unfortunate." He will make no inquiries into the
circumstances; several days must elapse before he asks
for further information.

The Indian is endowed with extraordinary sagacity, and
easily learns whatever demands attention. Experience and
observation render him conversant with things that are unknown
to the civilized man. Thus, he will traverse a plain
or forest one or two hundred miles in extent, and will arrive
at a particular place with as much precision as the mariner
by the aid of the compass. Unless prevented by obstacles,
he, without any material deviation, always travels in a
straight line, regardless of path or road. In the same manner
he will point out the exact place of the sun, when it is
hidden by mists or clouds. Thus, too, he follows with the[Pg 304]
greatest accuracy, the traces of men or animals, though
these should have passed over the leaves or the grass, and
nothing be perceptible to the eye of the white man. He
acquires this knowledge from a constant application of the
intellectual faculties, and much time and experience are required
to perfect this perceptive quality. Generally speaking,
he has an excellent memory.       He recollects all the
articles that have been concluded upon in their councils
and treaties, and the exact time when such councils were
held or such treaties ratified.

Some writers have supposed that the Indians are guided
by instinct, and have even ventured to assert that their
children would find their way through the forests as well as
those further advanced in age. I have consulted some of
the most intelligent Indians on this subject, and they have
uniformly told me that they acquire this practical knowledge
by long and close attention to the growth of 155 plants and
trees, and to the sun and stars. It is known that the north
side of a tree is covered with a greater quantity of moss
than any other, and that the boughs and foliage on the south
side are more abundant and luxuriant. Similar observations
tend to direct them, and I have more than once found
their reflections useful to myself in the excursions I have made
through the forests. Parents teach their children to remark
such things, and these in their turn sometimes add new
discoveries to those of their fathers. They measure distances
by a day's journey. When an Indian travels alone,
his day's journey will be about 50 or 60 English miles, but
only 15 or 20 when he moves with the camp. They divide
their journeys, as we do the hours, into halves and quarters;
and when in their councils they decide on war or on distant
excursions, they lay off these journeys with astonishing
accuracy on a kind of map, which they trace on bark or
skins. Though they have no knowledge of geography, nor[Pg 305]
of any science that relates to it, yet they form with sufficient
accuracy maps of the countries which they know; nothing
but the degrees of longitude and latitude are wanting in
some to make them exact.

I remember to have read in Fr. Charlevoix' journal that
the Indians are remarkably superstitious with respect to
dreams.[240] This is still the case, though they interpret them
in various ways. Some maintain that during sleep the
rational part of the soul travels about, whilst the sensitive
continues to animate the body. Others say that the good
Manitoo or familiar spirit gives salutary advice concerning
the future, whilst others hold that in sleep the soul visits
the objects about which she dreams. But all look upon
dreams as sacred, and as the ordinary channels through
which the Great Spirit and the Manitoos communicate
156 their designs to man. Impressed with this idea, the
Indian is at a loss to conceive why we disregard them. As
they look upon dreams as representations of the desires of
some unearthly genius, or of the commands of the Great
Spirit, they deem themselves bound to observe and obey
them. Charlevoix tells us somewhere, and I have seen
instances of a similar kind, that an Indian who had dreamed
that he had cut off his finger, actually cut it, and prepared
himself for the act by a fast. Another having dreamed
that he was a prisoner among a hostile nation, not knowing
how to act, consulted the jugglers, and according to their
decision, had himself bound to a stake, and fire applied to
several parts of his body. I doubt whether the quotation is
correct, as I have not the work of Charlevoix to consult, but
I know that I have described a superstitious belief which is
generally held by the Indians of the present day.

When the Pottowatomies or any of the northern nations
make or renew a treaty of peace, they present a wampum,[Pg 306]
sash or collar. The wampum is made of a shell called baceinum,
and shaped into small beads in the form of pearls.
When they conclude an alliance, offensive or defensive,
with other tribes, they send them a wampum, sash and
tomahawk dipped in blood, inviting them to come and
drink of the blood of their enemies. This figurative expression
often becomes a reality. Among the nations of
the West the calumet is looked upon with equal reverence,
whether in peace or war. They smoke the calumet to confirm
their treaties and alliances. This smoking is considered
a solemn engagement, and he who should violate it,
would be deemed unworthy of confidence, infamous, and
an object of divine vengeance. In time of war, the calumet
and all its ornaments are red. Sometimes it is partly red,
and partly of some other color. By the color and the manner
157 of disposing the feathers, a person acquainted
with their practices, knows at first sight what are the designs
or intentions of the nation that presents the calumet.

The smoking of the calumet forms a part of all their
religious ceremonies. It is a kind of sacred rite which they
perform when they prepare themselves to invoke the Great
Spirit, and take the sun and moon, the earth and the
water as witnesses of the sincerity of their intentions, and
the fidelity with which they promise to comply with their
engagements. However ridiculous this custom of smoking
may appear to some, it has a good effect among the Indians.
Experience has taught them that the smoke of the calumet
dispels the vapors of the brain, aids them to think and
judge with greater accuracy and precision, and excites their
courage. This seems to be the principal reason why they
have introduced it into their councils, where it is looked
upon as the seal of their decisions. It is also sent as a
pledge of fidelity to those whom they wish to consult, or
with whom they desire to form an alliance. I know that[Pg 307]
the opinions of the Indians concerning the beneficial effects
of smoking the calumet will be sanctioned by few persons,
because it is demonstrated from experience that the smoke
of tobacco acts as a powerful narcotic upon the nervous
system, and produces soporific and debilitating effects; but
it should be remembered that such effects are not produced
when the smoke is inhaled into the lungs, as is the universal
practice of the Indians.

The funeral ceremonies of the Calkobins, who inhabit
New Caledonia, west of the mountains, are fantastic and
revolting. Mr. Cox, in his journal, tells us that the body
of the deceased is exposed in his lodge for nine days, and
on the tenth is burned.[241] They choose for this purpose an
elevated place, and there erect a funeral pile.       158 In
the meanwhile, they invite their neighbors from all sides,
entreating them to repair to the ceremony. All the preparations
being completed, the corpse is placed on the pile, which
they light, while the spectators manifest the greatest joy.
All that the deceased possessed is placed around the body;
and if he be a person of distinction, his friends purchase[Pg 308]
for him a cloak, a shirt, and a pair of breeches: these are laid
beside him. The medicine man must be present, and, for
the last time, has recourse to his enchantments, to recall the
departed to life. Not succeeding, he covers the dead body       that
is, he makes a present of a piece of cloth, or leather, and
thus appeases the anger of the relatives, and escapes the
vengeance they have a right to inflict upon him. During
the nine days on which the corpse is exposed, the widow is
obliged to remain near it from the rising to the setting of the
sun; and, notwithstanding the excessive heats of summer,
no relaxation is allowed from this barbarous custom. While
the doctor is occupied in his last operation, the widow must
lie down beside the corpse, until he orders her to withdraw
from the pile; and this order is not given until the unfortunate
being is covered with blisters. She then is made
to pass and repass her hands through the flames, to collect
the fat, which flows from the body: with this she rubs
her person. When the friends of the deceased observe
that the sinews of the legs and arms begin to contract,
they force the miserable widow to return to the pile, and
straighten the limbs.

If, during the lifetime of the husband, the woman had
been unfaithful to him, or had neglected to provide for his
wants, his relations then revenge themselves upon her;
they throw her upon the pile, from whence she is dragged
by her own relations. She is again cast upon it, and again
withdrawn, until she falls into a state of insensibility.

159 The body being consumed, the widow gathers together
the largest bones; these she encloses in a birch box,
which she is forced to carry for many years. She is looked
upon while in this state as a slave; the hardest and most
laborious work falls to her lot; she must obey every order
of the women, and even of the children; and the least disobedience
or repugnance draws down upon her severe[Pg 309]
chastisement. The ashes of her husband are deposited in a
tomb, and it is her duty to remove from thence the weeds.
These unhappy women frequently destroy themselves to
avoid so many cruelties. At the end of three or four
years the relatives agree to put an end to her mourning.
They prepare a great feast for this occasion, and invite all
the neighbors. The widow is then introduced, still carrying
the bones of the husband; these are taken from her, and
shut up in a coffin, which is fastened at the end by a stake
about twelve feet long. All the guests extol her painful
widowhood; one of whom pours upon her head a vessel of
oil, whilst another covers her with down. It is only after
this ceremony that the widow can marry again; but, as
may be readily supposed, the number of those who hazard
a second marriage is very small.


I have the honor to be
Rev. and dear Father Provincial,
Your devoted servant and son,
P. J. De Smet, S.J.





LETTER XII


St. Marie, Dec. 30th, 1841.

Reverend Father:


I have given you the happy and consoling result of my
journey in November. Before the close of the year I have
yet to make you acquainted with what has passed during
my absence, and since my return, among the Flat Heads;
all goes to prove what I have advanced in my preceding
letters.

The Rev. Fathers Mengarini and Point were not idle
during my absence. The following will give you some idea
of the state of affairs on my return, both in regard to[Pg 310]
material and spiritual matters, as well as the practices and
usages established, which could not but tend to strengthen,
more and more, our good neophytes.

The plan mentioned in my letters, and unanimously approved,
and which we were urged to carry into execution,
was, to commence with what appeared to be the most urgent.
We enclosed the field destined to become God's portion of
the settlement. We started the buildings intended to be
hereafter dependencies of the farm, but serving temporarily
for a church and residence, on account of the approach of
winter, and our wish to unite the whole colony. These
works were indispensable, and were carried on with such
spirit that in the space of a month the new buildings could
shelter from four to five hundred souls.

The Flat Heads, assisting us with their whole heart and
161 strength, had, in a short time, cut from two to three
thousand stakes; and the three brothers, with no other tools
than the axe, saw and auger, constructed a chapel with pediment,
colonade and gallery, balustrade, choir, seats,      c. by
St. Martin's day; when they assembled in the little chapel
all the catechumens, and continued the instructions which
were to end on the third of December, the day fixed for
their baptism. In the interval between these two remarkable
epochs, there was, on each day, one instruction more
than usual. This last instruction, intended chiefly for
grown persons, was given at 8 o'clock in the evening, and
lasted about an hour and a quarter. These good savages,
whose ears and hearts are alike open when the word of God
is addressed to them, appeared still better disposed in the
evening; the silence being unbroken by the cries of infants
or children. Our heavenly Father so graciously heard their
prayers, that on St. Francis Xavier's day the good Fathers
had the consolation of baptising two hundred and two
adults.

[Pg 311]

So many souls wrested from the demons was more than
enough to excite their rage,       seeds of distrust, hindrances
occasioned by the best intentioned, the sickness of the interpreter
and sexton, at the very moment their assistance
was most required; a kind of hurricane, which took place
the evening before the baptism, and which overturned three
lodges in the camp, the trees torn from their roots, and
every thing in appearance about to be uprooted, even to
the foundations of the church       the organ unintentionally
broken by the savages, on the eve of being applied to so
beautiful a purpose       all seemed to conspire against them;
but the day for baptism arrives, and every cloud disappears.

The Fathers had intended to solemnize the marriages of
162 the husbands and wives on the same day as their
baptism. They had even announced that the ceremony
would take place after baptism; but the sacred rite having
occupied a much longer time than they supposed, on account
of the necessity of interpreting all that was said, they were
obliged to defer this sacrament until the next day, trusting
to God and the new Christians, for the preservation of their
baptismal innocence.

As our former Missionaries have left nothing in writing
on the conduct we should observe with regard to marriage,
it may, perhaps, be useful to relate here what has been our
course, in order that our conduct may be rectified if it has
not been judicious.

We hold the principle, that, generally speaking, there
are no valid marriages among the savages of these countries;
and for this reason; we have not found one, even among the
best disposed, who, after marriage had been contracted in
their own fashion, did not believe himself justified in sending
away his first wife, whenever he thought fit, and taking
another. Many even have several wives in the same lodge.
It is, however, true, that many when entering the marriage[Pg 312]
state, promise that nothing but death will ever separate them;
that they will never give their hand to another. But what
impassioned man or woman has not said as much? Can
we infer from this that the contract is valid, when it is universally
received, that even after such promises they have
not the less right to do as they please, when they become
disgusted with each other? We are then agreed on this
principle, that among them, even to the present time, there
has been no marriage, because they have never known well
in what its essence and obligation consisted. To adopt an
opposite view would be to involve oneself in a labyrinth of
difficulties, from which it would be 163 very difficult to
escape. This was, if I am not mistaken, the conduct of St.
Francis Xavier in the Indies, since it is said in his Life, that
he praised before the married those whom he supposed to be
dearest to them, that they might be more easily induced
to keep to one alone. Secondly, supposing then that there
were material faults in their marriages, the necessity of a
renewal was not spoken of but for the time which followed
baptism, and this took place the day following that happy
occasion.

After the Fathers had gained the necessary information
respecting the degrees of relationship, and had given the
necessary dispensations, the marriage ceremony, preceded
by a short instruction, was performed, and contributed
greatly to give the people a high idea of our holy religion.

The twenty-four marriages then contracted presented
that mixture of simplicity, of respectful affection, and profound
joy, which are the sure indications of a good conscience.
There were among the couples, good old men and
women; but their presence only rendered the ceremony
more respectable in the eyes of those assembled; for among
the Flat Heads all that relates to religion is sacred; unhappy
he who would so express himself before them, as[Pg 313]
to lead them to believe that he thought otherwise. They
left the chapel, their hearts filled with sentiments purified
by that grace which constitutes the charm of every state of
life, and especially of those in wedlock.

The only thing that appeared strange to them was, when
the Fathers spoke of taking the names of witnesses; but
when they were told that this was only done because the
church so ordained, to give more authority and dignity to
the marriage contract, they no longer saw in it any thing
but what was reasonable, and the question was, who should
be witness for the others?

164 The same astonishment was manifested with regard
to god-fathers. The interpreter had translated the word
god-father, a term which is not in their language, by second
father. The poor savages not knowing what this meant, or
what consequences this title would imply, were not eager
to make a choice. To be a god-father moreover offered no
great attraction. As soon as we made them understand it,
their difficulties vanished, and the more easily; for not to
multiply spiritual affinities, a god-father only was given to
the men, and a god-mother to the women; and as to the
obligations attached to the honour of being sponsors, they
were much less here than elsewhere, the Black Gowns
promising to take upon themselves the greatest part of the
burden. For the first baptisms our choice of sponsors was
very limited; only thirteen grown persons were qualified
to act in this capacity,       but the most aged persons being
baptised before the others, they, without laying aside the
lighted candle, (the symbol of faith) were chosen for the
second division; and so in like manner with the rest.

The day preceding the baptism, the Fathers, on account
of their labors, were only able to collect the colony twice;
besides, F. Mengarini was indisposed. In the evening,
however, he assembled the people, and great was their[Pg 314]
astonishment on beholding the decorations of the chapel.
Some days previously the Fathers had engaged all who
were willing, to make matts of rushes or straws. All the
women, girls and children, assembled eagerly for this good
work, so that they had enough to cover the floor and ceiling,
and hang round the walls. These matts, ornamented
with festoons of green, made a pretty drapery around the
altar. On a canopy was inscribed the holy name of Jesus.
Among the ornaments they placed a picture of the Blessed
Virgin over the tabernacle; on the door of the tabernacle a
165 representation of the heart of Jesus. The pictures of
the way of the Cross, in red frames; the lights, the silence of
night, the approach of the important day, the calm after the
hurricane, which had burst on them only a few moments
before       all these circumstances united, had, with the grace
of God, so well disposed the minds and hearts of our Indians,
that it would have been scarcely possible to find on
earth an assembly of savages more resembling a company
of saints. This was the beautiful bouquet which the Fathers
were permitted to present to Saint Francis Xavier. The
next day they were engaged from eight o'clock in the morning
until half past ten at night, in the church, excepting
only one hour and a half, which they gave to repose. The
following was the order followed. First, they baptized the
chiefs and married men. These were chosen as god-fathers
for the young men and little boys; then the married
women, whose husbands were living with them; afterwards
the widows and wives who had been cast off; and, lastly,
the young women and girls.

It was gratifying to hear with what intelligence these
good savages replied to all the questions addressed to them,
and to see them praying at the moment of receiving baptism.
At the end, each received a taper whose blended light beautifully
illuminated our humble chapel.

[Pg 315]

But let us come to something still more edifying. I shall
not speak of their assiduous attendance at the instructions,       of
their eagerness to hear our words,       of the evident
profit they received from them; all this is common in the
course of a mission; but rarely do we witness the heroic
sacrifices which these Indians have made. Many, who
had two wives, have retained her whose children were most
numerous, and with all possible respect dismissed the other.
One evening, a savage came to seek the 166 Fathers at the
lodge, which was filled with Indians, and unabashed by
any merely human consideration, asked what he should do
in his present circumstances? On the instant he acted
according to the instructions given him; he dismissed his
youngest wife, giving her what he would have wished another
to give to his sister, if in the same situation, and was re-united
to his first wife, whom he had forsaken. After an instruction,
a young woman, asking to speak, said that "she desired
very much to receive baptism, but that she had been so
wicked she dared not make the request." Each one would
have made a public confession. A great number of young
mothers, married according to the mode of the savages, but
abandoned by their husbands, who were of some other
tribe, renounced them most willingly, to have the happiness
of being baptised.

The ordinary regulations observed in the village are as
follows: when the Angelus rings, the Indians rise from
sleep; half an hour after, the morning prayers are said in
common; all assist at Mass and at the instruction. A
second instruction is given at evening, towards sun set,
and lasts about an hour and a quarter. At two o'clock
in the afternoon we have the regular catechism for the
children, at which grown persons may assist if they think
proper. The children are formed into two divisions: the
first is composed exclusively of those who know the first[Pg 316]
prayers; the second of the smaller children. One of the
Fathers each morning visits the sick, to furnish them
with medicines, and give them such assistance as their
wants may require.

We have adopted the system of instruction and bestowing
rewards, in usage in the schools of the brothers of the
Christian doctrine. During catechism, which lasts about
an hour, we have recitations and explanations, intermingled
167 with canticles. Every day, for each good answer,
tickets of approbation are given; one or more, according
to the difficulty of the question proposed. Experience has
proved that these tickets given at once, are less embarrassing
than when we mark their names on a list; the former plan
takes less time, and interests the children more, rendering
them, besides, more assiduous and careful. These tickets
serve, at the same time, as certificates of attendance at catechism,
and as tokens of intelligence and good will, they
please the parent not less than their children. The former
are incited to make their children repeat what has been said
at catechism, to render them capable of answering better the
following day; and also with a desire of improving themselves.
The wish to see their children distinguish themselves,
has attracted almost the whole colony to catechism:
none of the chiefs who have children fail to be there; and
there is not less emulation among the parents than among
the children themselves. A still greater value is attached
to the tickets, from the exactitude and justice with which
the deserving are rewarded. They who have obtained good
tickets during the week, are rewarded on Sunday with
crosses, medals, or ribbons, publicly distributed. On the
first Sunday of every month they distribute to those who
have received the most good tickets in the course of the
month, medals or pictures, which become their private
property. These pictures, preserved with care, are great[Pg 317]
stimulants, not only to the study of their catechism but also
to the practice of piety. They are monuments of victory,
examples of virtue, exhortations to piety, and models of
perfection. Their rarity, and the efforts necessary to
obtain them, also enhance their worth. As we desire
to inspire the savages, who are naturally inclined to
idleness, with a love for work, it has been judged suitable
to reward 168 their little efforts in the same manner as
we recompense their improvement in, and knowledge of
their catechism.

To maintain order, and promote emulation among them,
the catechism children are divided into seven or eight sections,
of six each; the boys on one side, the girls on the
other. At the head of each section there is a chief, who
must assist the children placed under him to learn their
catechism; that thus every child may indulge the hope of
meriting a reward at the end of the week or month. They
are so divided that the competitors, to the number of five or
six in each section, may be of nearly equal capacity.

Father Point, who was, immediately after Christmas,
to accompany the assembled camps of Flat Heads, Pends-d'oreilles,
Nez-perces,      c. prepared for his new campaign
by a retreat of eight days. Twenty-four marriages, as I
have already said, had been celebrated during my absence,
and two hundred and two adults, with little boys and girls
from eight to fourteen years of age, had been baptised.
There were still, thirty-four couples, who awaited my return,
to receive the sacraments of baptism and marriage, or
to renew their marriage vows. The Nez-perces had not
yet presented their children for baptism. There was an old
chief of the Black Feet nation, in the camp, with his son
and his little family, five in all, who had been hitherto very
assiduous in their attendance at prayers and catechism.
The day succeeding my arrival I commenced giving three[Pg 318]
instructions daily, besides the catechism, which was taught
by the other Fathers. They profited so well, that with the
grace of God, a hundred and fifteen Flat Heads, with three
chiefs at their head, thirty Nez-perces with their chief, and
the Black Foot chief and his family, presented themselves
at the baptismal font on Christmas day. I began my Masses
at seven o'clock in the morning; at five o'clock, P. M.
I 169 still found myself in the chapel: The heart can
conceive, but the tongue cannot express the emotions which
such a consoling spectacle may well awaken. The following
day I celebrated a solemn Mass of Thanksgiving for the
signal favours with which our Lord had deigned to visit
his people. From six to seven hundred new Christians,
with bands of little children, baptised in the past year,       all
assembled in a poor little chapel, covered with rushes       in
the midst of a desert, where but lately, the name of
God was scarcely known; offering to the Creator their
regenerated hearts, protesting that they would persevere
in His holy service even to death, was an offering, without
doubt, most agreeable to God, and which, we trust, will
draw down the dews of heaven upon the Flat Head
nation and the neighbouring tribes.

On the 29th the large camp, accompanied by the Fathers,
left us for the great buffalo hunt, and joined the Pends-d'oreilles,
who awaited them at two day's journey hence;
there will be above two hundred lodges. I am filled with
hope for the success and fresh victories, with which, I trust,
God will deign to reward the zeal of his servant. In the
mean time we occupy ourselves (Father Mengarini and
myself) in translating the catechism into the Flat Head
tongue; and in preparing one hundred and fifty persons for
their first communion.

Our good brothers and the Canadians are engaged at the
same time in erecting around our establishment a strong[Pg 319]
palisade, fortified with bastions, to shelter us from the
incursions of the Black Feet, whom we daily expect to
visit us. Our confidence in God is not weakened; we
take the precautions which prudence dictates, and remain
without fear at our post.

A young Sinpoil has just arrived in our camp, and these
170 are his words: "I am a Sinpoil, my nation is compassionate.
I have been sent to hear your words, and learn the
prayer you teach the Flat Heads. The Sinpoils desire also
to know it, and to imitate their example."[242] This young
man proposes to pass the winter in our camp, and return in
the spring to his own nation, to sow among them the seeds of
the gospel.

The whole Flat Head nation converted       four hundred
Kalispels baptised       eighty Nez-perces, several C      urs-d'aliene,
many Kooetenays, Black Feet, Serpents and Banacs,       the
Sinpoils, the Chaudieres,[243] who open their arms
to us, and eagerly ask for Fathers to instruct them; the
earnest demands from Fort Vancouver on the part of the
Governor,[244] and of the Rev. Mr. Blanchette, assuring us[Pg 320]
of the good desires and dispositions of a great number of
nations, ready to receive the gospel,       in a word, a vast
country, which only awaits the arrival of true ministers of
God, to rally round the standard of the Cross       behold the
beautiful bouquet, Rev. Father, which we have the happiness
of presenting you at the close of 1841.[245] It is at the foot
of the crucifix that you are accustomed to ask counsel of
heaven for the welfare of the nations entrusted to your
children. Our number is very far from sufficient for the
pressing and real wants of this people. The Protestants
are on the qui vive. Send us then some Fathers and
Brothers to assist us, and thousands of souls will bless you
at the throne of God for all eternity.

Recommending myself to your holy prayers,


I have the honour to be, with the most profound
respect and esteem,
Rev. Father, Yours,      c.

BOOK II


[Pg 322][Pg 323]



NARRATIVE OF A YEAR'S RESIDENCE
AMONG THE INDIAN TRIBES OF
THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS


Madison Forks,[246] 15th August, 1842.

Rev. and dear Father:


After a journey of four months and a half across an
ocean of prairies and mountains, where we met many an
obstacle, we arrived this day a year ago, under the auspices
of the Queen of Heaven, at one of the Forts of the
honorable company of Hudson Bay, called Fort Hall. Mr.
Ermantiger, the estimable commander of this Fort, received
us in the most friendly manner, and loaded us with favours.
At this place we found the vanguard of our dear neophytes
awaiting us. How joyful and happy was this meeting.
What had they not done to obtain Black Gowns to visit
them? Four times had their deputations crossed the Western
desert       eight of their people had perished on the road,
three from sickness, and five fell victims to the Scioux tribe.
Twice from the Bitter Root river almost all their people had
transported themselves to the Green river, a distance of
more than five hundred miles from their usual encampment.
In fine, those who then joined us had at the first news of
our approach again traversed the half of that space to meet
us; nor could they, on 174 first seeing us, express their
feelings but by their silence. Very soon, however, they gave
vent to the grateful sentiments of their hearts, in such a manner
as to astonish us. "I am very ignorant and wicked,"[Pg 324]
exclaimed the chief Wistelpo to his companions, "nevertheless
I am grateful to the Great Spirit for all he has done
for us." Detailing all the benefits he had received he
terminated his discourse in the following manner: "Yes,
my dear friends, my heart is filled with contentment, notwithstanding
its wickedness. I do not despair of the goodness
of God, I only wish for life to employ it in prayer;
never will I give up praying; I will continue to pray until my
death, and when that hour comes I will throw myself into
the arms of the Master of Life. If it be His will that I
should be lost I will submit to his decree. Should he wish
to save me I will bless him forever. Once more I repeat, my
heart is happy. What can we do to prove to our Fathers
that we love them."       Here the chief made some practical
reflections.

They informed us that since I left them in 1840 their
brothers had always remained in the same dispositions;
that according to the plan I had laid out for them, all the
people met twice every day, and three times on Sundays,
to recite in common the prayers I had taught them. They
also told us that the chest containing the sacred ornaments
and vases, which we had left in their charge, was carried
about as the ark of salvation, wherever they went; that
five or six children, dying after having received the sacrament
of baptism, had taken their flight to heaven; that
a young warrior, the day after his baptism, had died from
the effects of a wound, which, without the aid of a miracle,
would have carried him off long before; and finally, that
a young child, finding herself at the point of death, solicited
baptism with the greatest earnestness, and after having
received 175 this favour from the hands of Peter, an
Iroquois, she repeated three times to the witnesses of her
happiness: "pray for me       pray for me       pray for me;"
then she prayed herself and sang canticles with a stronger[Pg 325][Pg 326][Pg 327]
voice than any of the others, and upon drawing her last
breath, she exclaimed, pointing towards heaven: "Oh!
what a beautiful sight! I behold Mary, my mother, happiness
does not belong to earth, in heaven alone must
you seek it. Listen to what the Black Gowns tell you,
because they profess the truth;" and immediately afterwards
expired.


   
   
   Indian Mode of Travelling


We left Fort Hall on the 19th of the month, conducted
by our new guides, who were not long in giving us striking
proof of their devotion towards us. At the crossing of a
very rapid river, called the Lewis' Fork or Snake River,
from the savages who people its borders, one of our brothers,
not being able to guide the mules of his cart, was
dragged into a place so deep that his whole equipage was
plunged under the water; immediately the good savages
threw themselves into the river, raised the cart out of the
water, employed their hands and feet so usefully, that
only three mules were drowned and some bags of provisions
lost.

The 29th we met near the source of the Missouri, called
the Beaver Head, a detachment of Flat Heads, having as
their leader Ensyla, called the Little Chief, who has since
received in baptism the name of Michael, on account of his
fidelity and courage. A few days previous, a party of Indians
having been discovered on the adjacent heights, a cry
was raised of "the Black Feet! the Black Feet!" Instantly
the little camp put itself on the defensive. Two of
the bravest Flat Heads, lifting up their muskets in the air,
started off at full gallop to reconnoitre the enemy. Already
they had disappeared from our view, leaving us somewhat
anxious, but they soon returned, at the head of about ten
176 strangers. They were not the Black Feet, but a party
of the Banac tribe, a species of men half inimical and half
friendly to the Flat Heads, who for that very reason, as we[Pg 328]
shall see later, were more to be feared than open enemies.
When Michael joined us, the camp of these people was
already united with ours. Their chief and Michael knew
each other but too well, from having once been engaged in
an affair in which Michael, finding himself shamefully betrayed
and attacked by a whole Banac village, had only
been able to save himself and six men, who accompanied
him, by killing the brother of the Banac chief, with eight
of his people. They nevertheless shook hands with each
other, and separated the next day, without appearing to
entertain any unpleasant recollections. I had a conversation
with the Banac chief on the subject of prayer. He
listened attentively to what I told him, and promised to do
amongst his people what the Flat Heads did amongst theirs.
The 30th, after having wound through a mountain pass, to
which we gave the name of the Fathers' Defile, we advanced
as far as a large plain, on the western verge of which the
Flat Heads were encamped. As we drew near, runners
approached us constantly. Already, Stiettiet Loodzo, surnamed
the bravest of the brave, and distinguished from the
others by a large red ribbon, had presented himself. Soon
after, we perceived at a distance another savage, of tall
stature, hastening towards us with rapid strides. At the
same time, many cried out       "Paul," "Paul;" and indeed it
was Paul, surnamed "Big Face," the great chief of the nation;
Paul, who, owing to his virtue and his great age, had been
baptized the preceding year       Paul, whom they thought
absent, but who had just arrived, as though by God's
special permission, that he might have the satisfaction of
presenting us himself to his 177 people. At sun-set we
were in the midst of a most affecting scene. The Missionaries
were surrounded by their neophytes       men, women,
young people, and children in their mothers' arms, all anxious
to be among the first to shake hands with us. Every heart[Pg 329]
was moved. That evening was certainly beautiful. On
the feast of the holy name of Mary, the whole camp renewed
the consecration of themselves to their future Patroness,
which had been previously made by the vanguard of the
first settlement.

About the time the Church celebrates the feast of Mary's
pure heart, it seemed as though the God of the Christians
wished to give to her new children the consolation of seeing
the principal eras in their lives coincide, and in some
manner become identified with those happy days consecrated
especially to her honor. It was on the feast which
the Church celebrates in memory of her triumph, that we
first met with the Flat Heads; it will be on the 24th of September,
also one of the festivals, that we shall arrive on the
borders of our little Paraguay, and on the feast of the Holy
Rosary we shall select a beautiful spot for our first settlement,
and call it by the holy name of Mary. It is again
remarkable that the nomination took place on another feast
called the Patrocinium, or Patronage of the Blessed Virgin;
and thus, Mary, chosen patroness of the settlement, was
hailed for the first time on this spot with the angelical
salutation, accompanied by the ringing of bells. It was a
great consolation for us to speak of her goodness, in the
presence of the representatives of twenty-six different nations.
I forgot to mention that on the day we took possession
of the Blessed Mary's new demesne, we set up a large
cross in the middle of the camp, a circumstance rendered
more striking, from having, as they assured me, been predicted
178 by the young girl, called Mary, of whom I spoke
to you before. How much I wished that all those who take
a sincere interest in the progress of our holy religion, could
have been present. How their hearts would have glowed
within them on beholding all the good Flat Heads, from
the great chief to the smallest child, piously coming up to[Pg 330]
press their lips to the wood which was the instrument of
the world's salvation, and on their bended knees taking the
solemn promise of dying a thousand times rather than
abandon prayer, (religion.) I started the 28th October for
Fort Colville, which is situated on the Columbia river, to
procure provisions.[247] Ours had become so scanty, and
we entertained such slight hopes of obtaining them, that
we had already thought of converting into fishermen the
carpenters of our settlement. In case of their not being
successful, and thereby unable to supply our wants, we
intended accompanying the savages on their hunting expeditions.
Our only building as yet was a wooden house,
without a roof, and the winter had already set in. We began
by recommending our wants to God, and with God's
assistance we found ourselves, on St. Martin's day, in
possession of a temporary chapel, large enough to contain
all the colony, with about one hundred of the Pierced Nose
tribe, whom curiosity had attracted to the neighborhood.
Since that period they have been so careful in avoiding sin,
so exact in attending our instructions, and the fruit of the
divine word has been so visible in our settlement, that on
the 3d of December two hundred and two catechumens
were ranged in our chapel, waiting for baptism. This was[Pg 331]
too beautiful an offering to St. Francis Xavier, apostle of
the Indians, not to excite the fury of man's great enemy.       Accordingly,
for a few days previously we encountered
multiplied trials. To speak only of the most visible, the
prefect, 179 interpreter and sexton fell sick. The very
eve of the great day the environs were laid waste by a sort
of hurricane       the church windows were broken, large
trees were rooted up, and three huts were thrown down;
but these obstacles, far from prejudicing the triumph of
religion, served only to render it still more striking.

The catechumens having assembled in the chapel, which
had been adorned with its most beautiful ornaments, and
where they had been conducted for the more immediate
preparations of their hearts prior to receiving the great
sacrament of baptism, were so struck by the imposing
appearance of the chapel, and the melodious sounds of the
organ, now heard for the first time in the wilderness, that
they were not able to express their admiration. The next
day, with the exception of the time the Fathers took for
their dinner, they were in church from eight o'clock in the
morning until half past ten in the evening. How delightful
it was to listen to the intelligent answers of the good savages
to all the questions proposed to them. Never will those who
were present forget the pious spirit of their replies. The
rehabilitations of their marriages succeeded baptism, but
not without great sacrifices on their part, because, until
that time, the poor Indians had been ignorant of the unity
and indissolubility of the conjugal tie. We could not help
admiring the mighty effects of the sacrament of baptism in
their souls. One poor husband hesitated as to which of his
wives he should select. The oldest of them, perceiving his
irresolution, said to him: "You know how much I love
you, and I am also certain that you love me, but you cherish
another more; she is younger than I am. Well, remain[Pg 332]
with her; leave me our children, and in that manner we can
all be baptized." I could cite many such traits.

180 I will here begin the narrative of my journey to Colville.
On the eve of my departure I informed the Flat Heads
of my intentions. I requested them to procure some horses,
and a small escort, in case I should meet with any of their
enemies, the Black Feet. They brought to me seventeen
horses, the number I had asked them; and ten young and
brave warriors, who had already been often pierced with
balls and arrows in different skirmishes, presented themselves
to accompany me on my journey. With pleasure I
bear testimony to their devotedness, their child-like simplicity
and docility, politeness, complaisance and rare hilarity;
but, above all, to their exemplary piety.

These good Flat Heads endeavored in every manner to
divine and anticipate all my wants. On the afternoon of
the 28th October, as I have already said, we commenced
our march, and encamped at a distance of ten miles from
St. Mary's. That day we met no one but a solitary hunter,
who was carrying a buck, the half of which he offered
to us, with great eagerness. This furnished us with an
excellent supper, and a good breakfast for the next morning.
The 29th, snow fell in large flakes, notwithstanding which
we continued our march. We crossed, in the course of the
day, a fine stream, without a name       the same one which
the famous travellers, Lewis and Clarke, ascended in 1806,
on their way to the section of country occupied by the tribe
of the Pierced Noses, (or Sapetans.) I will call it the river
of St. Francis Borgia.[248] Six miles further south we crossed
the beautiful river of St. Ignatius. It enters the plain of the[Pg 333]
Bitter Root,       which we shall henceforward call St. Mary's,       by
a beautiful defile, commonly called, by the mountaineers
or Canadian hunters, the Devil's Gate;[249] for what
reason, however, I know not. These gentlemen have
frequently on their lips the words 181 devil and hell;
and it is perhaps on this account that we heard so often
these appellations. Be not then alarmed when I tell you
that I examined the Devil's pass, went through the Devil's
gate, rowed on Satan's stream, and jumped from the
Devil's horns. The "rake," one of the passes, the horns,
and the stream, really deserve names that express something
horrible       all three are exceedingly dangerous. The first
and second, on account of the innumerable snags which fill
their beds, as there are entire forests swallowed up by the
river. The third pass of which I spoke, adds to the difficulties
of the others a current still stronger. A canoe
launched into this torrent flies over it with the speed of an
arrow, and the most experienced pilot trembles in spite of
himself. Twice did the brave Iroquois, who conducted our
light canoe, exclaim: "Father, we are lost;" but a loud
cry of "courage       take courage, John, confide in God,
keep steady to the oar," saved us in that dangerous stream,
drew us out from between the horns and threatening teeth
of this awful "rake." But let us return to our account of
the journey to Colville. We spread our skins on the borders
of a little river at the foot of a high mountain, which we
were to cross the next day, having traversed St. Mary's valley,
a distance of about forty miles. This valley is from four to
seven miles wide, and above two hundred long. It has but
one fine defile, already mentioned, and which serves as the
entrance to, and issue from, the valley. The mountains
which terminate it on both sides appear to be inaccessible;
they are piles of jagged rocks, the base of which presents[Pg 334]
nothing but fragments of the same description, while the
Norwegian pine grows on those that are covered with
earth, giving them a very sombre appearance, particularly
in the autumn, in which season the snow begins to fall.
They abound in 182 bucks, buffalos, and sheep, whose wool
is as white as snow, and as fine as silk; also in all kinds of
bears, wolves, panthers, carcasiux,[250] tiger cats, wild cats,
and whistlers, a species of mountain rat. The moose is
found here, but is very seldom caught, on account of its
extraordinary vigilance, for, on the slightest rustling of a
branch it leaves off eating, and will not return to its food
for a long time afterwards. The soil of the valley is, with
some few exceptions, very light; it contains, however, some
good pastures. The whole course of the river is well lined
with trees; especially with the pine, the fir, cotton, and
willow trees.

Amongst the most remarkable birds we distinguished the
Nun's eagle, (so called by travellers on account of the color of
its head, which is white, whilst the other parts of the body
are black,) the black eagle, buzzard, waterfowl, heron, crane,
pheasant and quail. On the 30th we ascended a gap in the
mountain. The two sides were very lofty, and studded with
large pines, all the branches of which were covered with a
black and very fine moss, that hung in festoons, or in the
shape of mourning garlands, and added to the already
funereal appearance of this pass. We here filed off by a
little path, scarce worthy however of the name, for a distance
of six miles. The road was filled with large blocks of
stone and trunks of trees, placed as if it were on purpose to
render the pass difficult and impracticable. The summit
once attained, we proceeded to cross a smiling little plain,
called the Camash Prairies, where the Flat Heads come every
spring to dig up that nourishing root, which, together with[Pg 335]
the game they are able to procure, forms their chief nourishment.
We very soon descended the mountain in a zigzag
direction, and reached a beautiful plain, which is watered
by two rivers, the St. 183 Aloysius and St. Stanislaus.[251]
They unite in this plain, whence they go to join the forks at
Clark's, otherwise called the Flat Head river. This valley
extends about ten miles. I perceived in this place one of
those formidable Black Foot Indians in the act of hiding
himself. I did not speak of it to my young companions,
fearing that I might not be able to prevent a bloody struggle
between them. I however took the precaution of having
a good watch kept over our horses. The next day was Sunday,
a day of rest. I celebrated the Holy Sacrifice of the
Mass, and baptized three little children of the Pointed Hearts'
tribe, whose parents had joined us on the road. The rest
of the day was spent in prayer and instructions. The chief
of our band twice addressed his companions, and spoke
with much force and precision on the different portions of
our religion, which he already had heard explained. The
1st of November       All Saints' Day       after having celebrated
the Holy Sacrifice under a large poplar tree, we proceeded
on our journey through a defile of about six miles.
At the ford of the Great Clark's Fork, we met two encampments
of the Kalispel tribe, who, having heard of our approach,
had come thither to see us.[252] Men, women and[Pg 336]
children, ran to meet us, and pressed our hands with every
demonstration of sincere joy. The chief of the first camp
was called Chalax. I baptized twenty-four children in his
little village, and one young woman, a Koetenaise, who was
dying. The chief of the second camp was named Hoytelpo;
his band occupied thirty huts. I spent the night amongst
them; and, although they had never seen me before, they
knew all the prayers that I had taught the Flat Heads on my
first journey. The fact is, on hearing of my arrival in the
mountains, they deputed an intelligent young man to meet
me, and who was also gifted with a good 184 memory.
Having learned the prayers and canticles, and such points
as were most essential for salvation, he repeated to the village
all that he had heard and seen. He had acquitted
himself of his commission so well, and with so much zeal,
that he gave instructions to his people during the course of
the winter. The same desire for information concerning
religion, had communicated itself to the other small camps,
and with the same cheering success. It was, as you can
easily imagine, a great consolation for me to hear prayers
addressed to the great God, and his praises sung in a desert
of about three hundred miles extent, where a Catholic priest
had never been before. They were overjoyed when they
heard that I hoped before long to be able to leave a Missionary
amongst them. I cannot pass over in silence, a beautiful
custom that is observed by these good people: Every
evening, after prayers, the chief instructs his people, or gives
them some salutary advice, to which they all listen with most
profound attention, respect and modesty. To see them at
their devotions one would be more apt to mistake them for
perfectly religious men than savages. The next day, before
my departure, I baptised twenty-seven children of the
tribe. On that evening we alighted amongst fifteen huts[Pg 337]
of the same nation, who received us with equal kindness.[253]
Their chief had come several miles to meet me. He acknowledged
frankly that having become acquainted with
some American ministers, in the course of the summer       he
had been told by them that my prayer (religion) was
not a good one. "My heart is divided," said he, "and
I do not know what to adhere to." I had no trouble in
making him understand the difference between those gentlemen
and priests, and the cause of their calumnious attacks
against the only true church of Christ, which their ancestors
185 had abandoned. On the 3d of November, after
prayers and instructions to the savages, we continued our
march. We were on the borders of the Clarke Forks, to
which we were obliged to keep close during eight days,
whilst we descended the country bordering the stream. The
river is at this place of a greenish blue, very transparent,
caused probably by the deposit of a great quantity of oxigen
of iron.[254] Our path during a great part of the day was
on the declivity of a lofty, rocky mountain; we were here
obliged to climb a steep rough pass from 400 to 600 feet high.
I had before seen landscapes of awful grandeur, but this one
certainly surpassed all others in horror. My courage failed
at the first sight; it was impossible to remain on horseback,
and on foot my weight of two hundred and eleven pounds,
was no trifle. This, therefore, was the expedient to which
I resorted: My mule Lizette was sufficiently docile and
kind to allow me to grasp her tail, to which I held on firmly:
crying at one moment aloud, and at other times making
use of the whip to excite her courage, until the good beast
conducted me safely to the very top of the mountain.       There[Pg 338]
I breathed freely for awhile, and contemplated the
magnificent prospect that presented itself to my sight.

The windings of the river with the scenery on its banks
were before me, on one side hung over our heads, rocks
piled on rocks in the most precipitous manner, and on the
other stood lofty peaks crowned with snow and pine trees:
mountains of every shape and feature reared their towering
forms before us. It really was a fine view and one which
was well worth the effort we had made. On descending
from this elevation I had to take new precautions. I preceded
the mule, holding her by the bridle, while she moved
cautiously down to the foot of the "Bad Rock," (as it is
called by the savages,) as though she feared stumbling 186
and rolling with her master into the river which flowed
beneath us. At this place Clarke's Fork runs through a narrow
defile of rocky mountains; at times the soft murmurings
of the waters charm the traveller, at others it spreads
out and presents a calm surface clear as crystal. Wherever
it is narrowed or intercepted by rocks it forms rapids, with
falls and cascades; the noise of which, like that caused by
a storm in the forest, is heard at a great distance. Nothing
can be more diversified than this fine river.[255] There is in
this vicinity a great variety of trees, bushes and different
species of the tamarisk tree. The lichnis, a medicinal plant
mentioned by Charlevoix in his history of Canada, grows
here abundantly. We met in the course of that day with
only one family, and that was of the Kalispel tribe. Whilst
the women were rowing up the river their light canoe, made
of the fir tree bark, which contained their children and all[Pg 339]
the baggage, the men followed along the bank with their
rifles or bows in their hands in pursuit of game.

On the 4th we entered a cedar and pine forest so dense
that in its whole length we could scarcely see beyond the
distance of twenty feet. Our beasts of burden suffered a
great deal in it from the want of grass. We scarcely got
through it after three day's march. It was a real labyrinth;
from morning till night we did nothing but wind about to
avoid thousands of trees, fallen either from fire, storms or
age. On issuing from this forest we were charmed by an
interesting prospect: Our view extended over the whole
surface of the lake called "Pends-d'oreilles," studded with
small islands covered with woods: over its inlets and the
hills which overlook them, and which have for the most
part their base on the borders of the lake and rise by
gradual terraces or elevations until they reach the adjoining
mountains, which are covered with perpetual snow.
The 187 lake is about 30 miles long and from 4 to 7 wide.[256]
At the head of it we traversed a forest, which is certainly a
wonder of its kind; there is probably nothing similar to it in
America. The savages speak of it as the finest in Oregon,
and really every tree which it contains is enormous in its
kind. The birch, elm and beech, generally small elsewhere,
like the toad of La Fontaine, that aimed at being as
large as the ox, swell out here to twice their size. They
would fain rival the cedar, the Goliath of the forest, who,
however, looking down with contempt upon his pitiful
companions,


"Eleve aux cieux
Son front audacieux."

"Rears to heaven his audacious head."

[Pg 340]
The birch and beech at its side, resemble large candelabras
placed around a massive column. Cedars, of four and five
fathoms in circumference, are here very common; we saw
some six, and I measured one forty-two feet in circumference.
A cedar of four fathoms, lying on the ground, measured
more than two hundred feet in length.[257] The delicate
branches of these noble trees entwine themselves above the
beech and elm; their fine, dense and ever-green foliage,
forming an arch through which the sun's rays never
penetrate; and this lofty vault, supported by thousands
of columns, brought to the mind's eye, the idea of an
immense, glorious temple, carpeted with the hardy ever-greens
that live and flourish best in the shade.

Before entering the forest we crossed a high mountain by
a wild winding path. Its sides are covered with fine cedars
and pines, which are, however, of smaller dimensions than
those in the forest. Several times whilst ascending the
mountain I found myself on parapets of rocks, whence,
thanks to my safe-footed mule, I retired in safety. Once I
188 thought my career at an end. I had wandered from
my companions, and following the path, I all at once came
to a rocky projection which terminated in a point about
two feet wide; before me was a perpendicular descent of
three feet; on my left stood a rock as straight as a wall, and
on my right yawned a precipice of about a thousand feet.       You
can conceive that my situation was anything but
pleasant. The slightest false step would have plunged the
mule and his rider into the abyss beneath. To descend
was impossible, as on one side I was closed in by the rock,
and suspended over a dreadful chasm on the other. My[Pg 341]
mule had stopped at the commencement of the descent, and
not having any time to lose, I recommended myself to God,
and as a last expedient sunk my spurs deeply into the sides
of my poor beast; she made one bold leap and safely landed
me on another parapet much larger than that I had left.

The history of the fine forest, and my leap from the dangerous
rock, will be treated with incredulity by many of your
acquaintance. If so, tell them that I invite them to visit
both these places: "Venite et videte." I promise them
before hand that they will admire with me the wonders
of nature. They will have, like me, their moments of
admiration and of fear. I cannot pass over in silence the
pleasant meeting I had in the depth of the forest. I discovered
a little hut of rushes, situated on the banks of the
river. Raising my voice to its highest pitch, I tried to make
its inhabitants hear me, but received no answer. I felt
an irresistible desire to visit it, and accordingly made my
interpreter accompany me. We found it occupied by a
poor old woman, who was blind, and very ill. I spoke to
her of the Great Spirit, of the most essential dogmas of our
faith, and of baptism. The example of the Apostle St.
189 Philip teaches us that there are cases when all the
requisite dispositions may entirely consist in an act of faith,
and in the sincere desire to enter Heaven by the right path.
All the answers of the poor old woman were respectful, and
breathing the love of God. "Yes," she would say, "I
love the Great Spirit with my whole heart; all my life he
has been very kind to me. Yes, I wish to be His child, I
want to be His forever." And immediately she fell on her
knees, and begged me to give her baptism. I named her
Mary, and placed around her neck the miraculous medal
of the Blessed Virgin. After leaving her, I overheard her
thanking God for this fortunate adventure. I had scarcely
regained the path, when I met her husband, almost bent[Pg 342]
to the earth by age and infirmity; he could hardly drag himself
along. He had been setting a trap in the forest for the
bucks. The Flat Heads who had preceded me, had told
him of my arrival. As soon, therefore, as he perceived me,
he began to cry out, with a trembling voice: "Oh how
delighted I am to see our Father before I die. The Great
Spirit is good       oh how happy my heart is." And the
venerable old man pressed my hand most affectionately,
repeating again and again the same expressions. Tears
fell from my eyes on witnessing such affection. I told him
that I had just left his hut, and had baptized his wife. "I
heard," said he, "of your arrival in our mountains, and of
your baptizing many of our people. I am poor and old;
I had hardly dared to hope for the happiness of seeing you.
Black-gown, make me as happy as you have made my wife.
I wish also to belong to God, and we will always love Him."
I conducted him to the borders of a stream that flowed near
us, and after a brief instruction, I administered to him the
Holy Sacrament of Baptism, naming him Simon. On seeing
me depart, he repeated, impressively: 190 "Oh how
good is the Great Spirit. I thank you, Skylax, (Black-gown)
for the favor you have conferred on me. Oh how
happy is my heart. Yes, I will always love the Great Spirit.
Oh how good the Great Spirit is; how good He is." During
that same journey, I discovered in a little hut of bulrushes,
five old men, who appeared to be fourscore years
old. Three of them were blind, and the other two had but
one eye each; they were almost naked, and offered a real
personification of human misery. I spoke to them for a
considerable time on the means of salvation, and on the
bliss of another world. Their answers edified me much,
and affected me even to tears; they were replete with the
love of God, a desire of doing right, and of dying well.
You might have heard these good old men crying out from[Pg 343]
different parts of the hut, forming together a touching
chorus, to which I sincerely wished that all the children of
St. Ignatius could have listened. "Oh Great Spirit, what a
happiness is coming to us in our old days! We will love you,
O Great Spirit. Le-mele Kaikolinzoeten; one le-mele eltelill.
We will love you, O Great Spirit. Yes, we will love you
until death." When we explained to them the necessity of
baptism, they demanded it earnestly, and knelt down to receive
it. I have not found as yet amongst these Indians, I
will not say opposition, but not even coldness or indifference.
These little adventures are our great consolation. I would
not have exchanged my situation, at that moment, for any
other on earth. I was convinced that such incidents alone
were worth a journey to the mountains. Ah, good and
dear Fathers, who may read these lines, I conjure you,
through the mercy of our Divine Redeemer, not to hesitate
entering this vineyard; its harvest is ripe and abundant.
Does not our Saviour tell us: "Ignem veni mittere in terram
et quid volo nisi ut accendatur." 191 It is amidst
the poor tribes of these isolated mountains that the fire
of divine grace burns with ardor. Superstitious practices
have disappeared; nor have they amongst them the castes
of East India. Speak to these Savages of heavenly things;
at once their hearts are inflamed with divine love; and
immediately they go seriously about the great affair of their
salvation. Day and night they are at our sides, insatiable
for the "Bread of Life." Often, on retiring, we hear them
say, "Our sins, no doubt, rendered us so long unworthy to
hear these consoling words." As to privations and dangers,
the Oregon Missionaries must expect them, for they will
certainly meet them, but in a good cause. Sometimes they
will be obliged to fast, but a better appetite will be their
reward. Their escapes from the many dangers of the road,
or from enemies always on the alert, teach them to confide[Pg 344]
in God alone, and ever to keep their accounts in order. I
here feel the full application of that consoling text of the
Scripture: "My yoke is sweet, and my burden is light."
At the last day it will be manifest that the holy name of
Jesus has performed wonders amongst these poor people.
Their eagerness to hear the glad tidings of salvation is certainly
at its height. They came from all parts, and from
great distances, to meet me on my way, and presented all
their young children and dying relatives for baptism. Many
followed me for whole days, with the sole desire of receiving
instructions. Really our hearts bled at the sight of so
many souls who are lost for the want of religion's divine
and saving assistance. Here again may we cry out with
the Scripture: "The harvest indeed is great, but the laborers
are few." What Father is there in the Society whose zeal
will not be enkindled on hearing these details? And where
is the Christian who would refuse his mite to such 192 a
work as that of the "Propagation of the Faith?" that precious
pearl of the Church, which procures salvation to so many
souls, who otherwise would perish unaided and forever.
During my journey, which lasted forty-two days, I baptized
190 persons, of whom 26 were adults, sick, or in extreme
old age; I preached to more than two thousand Indians;
who thus evidently conducted into my way by Providence,
will not, I trust, tarry long in ranging themselves under the
banner of Jesus Christ. With the assistance of my catechists,
the Flat Heads, who were as yet but catechumens, the conversion
of the Kalispel tribe was so far advanced that when
the time came round for the winter's hunting, the Rev.
Father Point enjoyed the consolation of seeing them join
the Flat Head tribe, with the sole desire of profiting by the
Missionary's presence. This gave him an opportunity to
instruct and baptise a great number on the Purification and
on the Feasts of the Canonization of St. Ignatius and St.[Pg 345][Pg 346][Pg 347]
Francis Xavier. On my return, the 8th of December,[258]
I continued instructing those of the Flat Heads who had
not been baptized. On Christmas day I added 150 new
baptisms to those of the 3d of December, and 32 rehabilitations
of marriage; so that the Flat Heads, some sooner
and others later, but all, with very few exceptions, had, in
the space of three months, complied with every thing necessary
to merit the glorious title of true children of God. Accordingly
on Christmas eve, a few hours before the midnight
Mass, the village of St. Mary was deemed worthy of a special
mark of heaven's favour: The Blessed Virgin appeared to
a little orphan boy named Paul, in the hut of an aged and
truly pious woman.       The youth, piety and sincerity of
this child, joined to the nature of the fact which he related,
forbade us to doubt the truth of his statement. The following
is what he recounted 193 to me with his own innocent
lips: "Upon entering John's hut, whither I had gone to
learn my prayers, which I did not know, I saw some one
who was very beautiful       her feet did not touch the earth,
her garments were as white as snow; she had a star over
her head, a serpent under her feet; and near the serpent
was a fruit which I did not recognise. I could see her heart,
from which rays of light burst forth and shone upon me.
When I first beheld all this I was frightened, but afterwards
my fear left me; my heart was warmed, my mind clear,
and I do not know how it happened, but all at once I knew
my prayers." (To be brief I omit several circumstances.)[Pg 348]
He ended his account by saying that several times the same
person had appeared to him whilst he was sleeping; and
that once she had told him she was pleased, that the first
village of the Flat Heads should be called "St. Mary." The
child had never seen or heard before any thing of the kind;
he did not even know if the person was a man or woman,
because the appearance of the dress which she wore was
entirely unknown to him. Several persons having interrogated
the child on this subject, have found him unvarying
in his answers. He continues by his conduct to be the
angel of his tribe.


   
   
   Apparition


On the 23d of December, Father Point, at the head of the
inhabitants of forty lodges, started for the buffalo hunt.       On
the road they met with huntsmen of five or six different
tribes, some of whom followed him to the termination of
the chase, from the desire of learning their prayers. The
Flat Heads having prolonged their stay at St. Mary's as
long as they possibly could, so as not to depart without receiving
baptism, experienced such a famine, the first weeks of
January, that their poor dogs, having not even a bone to
gnaw, devoured the very straps of leather with which they
tied their horses during the night. The cold moreover was
194 so uninterruptedly severe that during the hunting season,
which lasted three months, such a quantity of snow fell
that many were attacked with a painful blindness, vulgarly
called "snow disease." One day when the wind was very
high, and the snow falling and freezing harder than usual,
Father Point became suddenly very pale, and would no
doubt have been frozen to death, in the midst of the plain,
had not some travellers, perceiving the change in his countenance,
kindled a large fire. But neither the wind, ice,
or famine, prevented the zealous Flat Heads from performing
on this journey all they were accustomed to do at St.
Mary's. Every morning and evening they assembled around[Pg 349]
the Missionary's lodge, and more than three-fourths of them
without any shelter than the sky, after having recited their
prayers, listened to an instruction, preceded and followed
by hymns. At day-break and sunset the bell was tolled
three times for the Angelical Salutation. The Sunday was
religiously kept; an observance which was so acceptable
to God, that once especially it was recompensed in a very
visible manner. The following is what I read in the Journal
kept by Father Point during the winter's hunt.

Sixth February.       To-day, Sunday, a very high wind,
the sky greyish, and the thermometer at the freezing point;
no grass for the horses; the buffalos driven off by the
Pierced Noses. The 7th, the cold more piercing       food
for our horses still scarcer       the snow increasing; but yesterday
was a time of perfect rest, and the fruits of it show
themselves to-day in perfect resignation and confidence.
At noon we reached the summit of a mountain, and what a
change awaits us. The sun shines, the cold has lost its
intensity; we have in view an immense plain, and in that
plain good pasturages, which are clouded with buffalos.
The encampment stops, the hunters assemble, and before
195 sunset 155 buffalos have fallen by their arrows. One
must confess that if this hunt were not miraculous, it bears
a great resemblance to the draught of fishes made by Peter
when casting his net at the word of the Lord, he drew up
153 fishes.       St. John, xxi. 11. The Flat Heads confided
in the Lord, and were equally successful in killing 153
buffalos. What a fine draught of fishes! but what a glorious
hunt of buffalos! Represent to yourself an immense
amphitheatre of mountains, the least of which exceeds in
height Mont Martre,[259] and in the midst of this majestic[Pg 350]
enclosure a plain more extensive than that of Paris, and on
this magnificent plain a multitude of animals, the least of
which surpasses in size the largest ox in Europe. Such was
the park in which our Indians hunted. Wishing to pursue
them, continues Father Point, in his journal, I urged on
my horse to a herd of fugitives, and as he was fresh, I had
no difficulty in getting up to them. I even succeeded in
compelling the foremost to abandon his post, but enraged,
he stopped short, and presented such a terrible front, that
I thought it more prudent to open a passage and let him
escape. I acted wisely, as on the same day, one of these
animals, in his fall, overturned a horse and his rider. Fortunately,
however, the latter was more dexterous than I
should have been in such a perilous situation; he aimed
his blows so promptly and well, that of the three who were
thrown, only two arose. On another occasion, a hunter
who had been also dismounted, had no other means to
avoid being torn to pieces than to seize hold of the animal
by the horns just at the time he was about to trample him
to death. A third hunter, fleeing at all speed, felt himself
stopped by the plaited tail of his horse hooked on the
buffalo's horn; but both fearing a trap, made every effort to
disengage themselves. The buffalo hunt is attended with
196 dangers, but the greatest of these does not consist in the
mere pursuit of the animal, but proceeds rather from the
bands of Black Feet who constantly lurk in these regions,
especially when there is some prospect of meeting with the
larger game, or stealing a number of horses. Of all the
mountain savages the Black Feet are the most numerous,
wicked, and the greatest thieves. Happily, however, from
having been often beaten by the smaller tribes, they have
become so dastardly, that unless they are twenty to one,
they confine their attacks to the horses, which, thanks to
the carelessness of their courageous enemies, they go about[Pg 351]
with so much dexterity and success, that this year, while
our good Flat Heads were asleep, they discovered their
animals as often as twenty times, and carried off more than
one hundred of them. During the winter, about twenty
of these gentlemen visited the Flat Heads in the day time,
and without stealing any thing, but in this manner. There
resided in the camp an old chief of the Black Feet tribe,
who had been baptised on Christmas day, and named
Nicholas; this good savage, knowing that the Missionary
would willingly hold an interview with his brethren, undertook
himself to harangue them during the night, and so
well did he acquit himself, that upon the calumet's being
planted on the limits of the camp, and the messenger being
admitted to an audience, singing was heard in the neighboring
mountains, and soon after a band of these brigands
issued, armed as warriors, from the gloomy defile. They
were received as friends, and four of the principals were
ushered into the Missionary's lodge; they smoked the calumet
and discussed the news of the day. The Missionary
spoke of the necessity of prayer, to which subject they
listened most attentively; nor did they manifest either surprise
or repugnance. They told him that there had arrived
197 recently in one of their forests a man who was not
married, and who wore on his breast a large crucifix, read
every day in a big book, and made the sign of the cross
before eating any thing; and in fine, that he was dressed
exactly like the Black-gowns at St. Mary's. The Father
did every thing in his power to gain their good will       after
which, they were conducted to the best lodge in the encampment.
It certainly would seem that such hosts were worthy
of better guests. However, towards the middle of the night,
the explosion of fire arms was heard. It was soon discovered
that a Flat Head was firing at a Black Foot, just
as the latter was leaving the camp, taking with him four[Pg 352]
horses.       Fortunately, the robber was not one of the band
that had been received within the encampment, which,
upon being proved, far from creating any suspicion, on the
contrary, had the effect of their kindly offering them a grave
for the unfortunate man. But whether they wished to
appear to disapprove of the deed, or that they anticipated
dangers from reprisals, they left the wolves to bury the body,
and took their departure. Good Nicholas, the orator, joined
them, in order to render the same services to the others that
he had to these. He went off, promising to return soon
with the evidences of his success. He has not been seen
as yet, but we are informed, he and his companions have
spoken so favorably of prayer, and the Black-gowns, that
already the Sunday is religiously observed in the camp
where Nicholas resides, and that a great chief, with the
people of sixty lodges, intend shortly to make our acquaintance,
and attach themselves to the Flat Heads. In the
meanwhile, divine justice is punishing rigorously a number
of their robbers. This year, the Pierced Noses caught
twelve of them in flagrant faults, and killed them. About
the time that the Black Foot above mentioned met his fate
at 198 the hands of a Flat Head, thirty others Were receiving
the reward due to their crimes, from the Pends-d'oreilles
tribe. A very remarkable fact in this last encounter is,
that of the four who commenced, and the others who finished
it, not one fell; although, in order to break in on the delinquents,
who were retrenched behind a kind of rampart,
they were obliged to expose themselves to a brisk fire. I
saw the field of combat some time afterwards. Of the
thirty robbers who had been slain, only five or six heads
remained, and those so disfigured as to lead one to think
that an age had already elapsed since their death.

Two years before, the same tribe, (Pends-d'oreilles)
assisted by the Flat Heads, making in all a band of seventy[Pg 353]
men, stood an attack of fifteen hundred Black Feet, whom
they defeated, killing in five days, during which time the
battle lasted, fifty of their foes, without losing a single man
on their side. They would not commence the attack until
they had recited their prayers on their knees. A few days
ago, the spot was pointed out to me where six Flat Heads
withstood 160 Black Feet with so much resolution, that
with a handful of their men who came to their aid, they
gained the victory. The most perfidious nation, after the
Black Feet, is the Banac tribe; they also bear the Flat
Heads much ill will. It has happened more than once that
at the very moment the Banac tribe were receiving the
greatest proofs of friendship from the Flat Heads, the former
were plotting their ruin. Of this you have already had
one proof, but here is another. One day a detachment of
two hundred Banacs visited the camp of the Flat Heads,
and after smoking with them returned to their encampment.
The small number of the Flat Heads had not, however,
escaped their notice, and they determined to take
advantage of their apparent weakness. Accordingly, they
199 retraced their steps that very night to execute their
base designs. But the chief, named Michael, having been
advised of their intention, assembled in haste his twenty
warriors, and after entreating them to confide in God, he
rushed on these traitors so happily and vigorously, that at
the first shock they were routed. Already nine of the fugitives
had fallen, and most of the others would have shared
the same fate if Michael, in the very heat of the pursuit,
had not recollected that it was Sunday, and on that account
stopped his brave companions, saying: "My friends, it
is now the time for prayer; we must retire to our camp."
It is by these and similar exploits, wherein the finger of
God is visible, that the Flat Heads have acquired such a
reputation for valor, that notwithstanding their inferior[Pg 354]
numbers, they are feared much more than they on their
side dread their bitterest enemies. These victories however
cannot but be fatal even to the conquerors; hence we
will strive to inspire all with the love of peace, which may
be accomplished if each party remains at home. For this
purpose we must create among them a greater taste for agriculture
than for hunting. But how can we compass this
unless the same measures are employed for the missions
of the Rocky Mountains that were so happily adopted for
Paraguay. If the true friends of Religion only knew of
what the Indians who surround us are capable when once
converted, I can not doubt but that they would assist us
in our efforts to accomplish so beautiful, so advantageous
a project. It is, moreover, through the Iroquois of the
North, whose cruelty formerly exceeded that of the Black
Feet, that the knowledge of the true God came to the Flat
Heads, and awakened amongst them the desire of possessing
the Black-gowns. We have seen to what dangers the
good Flat Heads exposed themselves to obtain Missionaries,
200 and what sacrifices they have made to merit the title
of children of God; and now what is their actual progress?
In their village, enmities, quarrels and calumnies, are unknown;
they are sincere and upright amongst themselves,
and full of confidence in their Missionaries. They carry
this to such a degree that they place implicit reliance on
their veracity, and cannot suppose that they have any thing
else in view but their happiness; they have no difficulty
in believing the mysteries of our faith, or in approaching
the tribunal of penance: difficulties which appear insurmountable
to the pride and cowardice of many civilized
Christians. The first time they were asked if they believed
firmly in all that was contained in the Apostles' creed, they
answered, "Yes       very much." When they were spoken
to about confession, some wished it to be public.       This[Pg 355]
will explain to you how it happened that before we resided
three months amongst them we were enabled to baptize
all the adults, and four months later to admit a large number
to frequent communion. There are whole families
who never let a Sunday go by without approaching the
holy table. Often twenty confessions are heard consecutively
without their being matter for absolution. This
year we performed the devotion of the month of Mary,
and I can flatter myself that the exercises were attended
with as much piety and edification as in the most devout
parishes of Europe. At the end of the month a statue was
borne in triumph to the very place where our Blessed Mother
designed to honor us with the aforementioned apparition.       Since
that day a sort of pilgrimage has been established
there, under the name of "Our Lady of Prayer." None
pass the pious monument without stopping to pray on their
knees; the more devout come regularly twice a day to speak
to their Mother and her divine Son, and the children 201
add to their prayers the most beautiful flowers they can
cull in the prairies.

On the Feast of the Sacred Heart we made use of this
monument, decorated with garlands of flowers, as a repository,
and our people received for the first time, the benediction
of the blessed sacrament; a happiness which they
now enjoy every Sunday after vespers. Some of them
already understand the nature of the devotion of the Sacred
Heart. To propagate it we have laid the foundations of
several societies, of which all the most virtuous men, women
and young people have become members. Victor, the
great chief, is prefect of one of these associations, and Agnes
his wife is president of another. They were not elected
through any deference for their dignity or birth, but solely
on account of their great personal merits.[260] A fact which[Pg 356]
proves that the Flat Heads regard merit more than rank,
is, that the place of great chief becoming vacant by the
death of Peter, they chose for his successor the chief of the
men's society, and for no other reason did he obtain this
high dignity than for the noble qualities, both of heart and
head, which they all thought he possessed. Every night
and morning, when all is quiet in the camp, he harangues
the people; the subject of his discourse being principally
a repetition of what the Black Gowns have said before.
This good chief walks faithfully in the footsteps of his predecessor,
which is no slight praise. This last, who was
baptized at the age of 80, and admitted to communion in
his 82d year, was the first to deserve this double favour,
more on account of his virtue than his years. The day of
his baptism he said to me, "If during my life I have committed
faults they were those of ignorance; it appears to
me that I never did any thing, knowing it to be wrong."
At the time of his first communion, which preceded his
death but 202 a few days, having been asked if he had
not some faults with which to reproach himself since his
baptism       "Faults," he replied, with surprise, "how could
I ever commit any, I whose duty it is to teach others how
to do good?" He was buried in the red drapery he was
accustomed to hang out on Sunday to announce that it was
the day of the Lord. Alphonsus, in the prime of youth,
soon followed him. He said to me on the day of his baptism:
"I dread so much offending again the Great Spirit,
that I beg of him to grant me the grace to die soon." He
fell sick a few days afterwards and expired with the most[Pg 357]
Christian dispositions, thanking God for having granted
his prayer. In the hope of their glorious resurrection, their
mortal remains have been deposited at the foot of the large
cross.

Of twenty persons who died within the year, we have
no reason to fear for the salvation of one.

Not having been able this year to obtain either provisions
or sufficient clothes to supply the wants of our mission, I
started for Fort Vancouver, the great mart of the honorable
Hudson Bay Company, and distant about one thousand
miles from our establishment. The continuation of this
narrative will show you that this necessary journey was
providential. I found myself during this trip a second time
amongst the Kalispel tribe.

They continue with much fervour to assemble every morning
and evening to recite prayers in common, and manifest
the same attention and assiduity in listening to our instructions.
The chiefs on their side are incessant in exhorting
the people to the practice of every good work. The two
principal obstacles that prevent a great number from receiving
baptism, are       first, the plurality of wives; many have
not the courage to separate themselves from those, by whom
they have children. The second is their 203 fondness for
gambling, in which they risk every thing. I baptized 60
adults amongst them during this last journey.

Crossing a beautiful plain near the Clarke or Flat Head
river, called the Horse prairie, I heard that there were 30
lodges of the Skalzy or K      tenay tribe, at about two day's
journey from us.[261] I determined whilst awaiting the descent[Pg 358]
of the skiff, which could only start six days later, to pay
them a visit, for they had never seen a priest in their lands
before. Two half breeds served as my guides and escorts
on this occasion. We gallopped and trotted all the day,
travelling a distance of 60 miles. We spent a quiet night
in a deep defile, stretched near a good fire, but in the open
air. The next day, (April 14) after having traversed several
mountains and valleys, where our horses were up to their
knees in snow, we arrived about 3 o'clock in sight of the
K      tenay camp. They assembled immediately on my
approach; when I was about twenty yards from them, the
warriors presented their arms, which they had hidden until
then under their buffalo robes. They fired a general salute
which frightened my mule and made her rear and prance
to the great amusement of the savages. They then defiled
before me, giving their hands in token of friendship and
congratulation. I observed that each one lifted his hand
to his forehead after having presented it to me. I soon convoked
the council in order to inform them of the object of
my visit. They unanimously declared themselves in favour
of my religion, and adopted the beautiful custom of their
neighbours, the Flat Heads, to meet night and morning
for prayers in common. I assembled them that very evening
for this object and gave them a long instruction on the
principal dogmas of our faith. The next day, I baptized
all their little children and nine of their adults, previously
instructed, amongst whom was the wife of an Iroquois, 204
who had resided for thirty years with this tribe. The Iroquois
and a Canadian occupy themselves in the absence of
a priest in instructing them. My visit could not be long.
I left the K      tenay village about 12 o'clock, accompanied
by twelve of these warriors and some half-blood Crees,[Pg 359]
whom I had baptized in 1840. They wished to escort me
to the entrance of the large Flat Head lake,[262] with the desire
of giving me a farewell feast; a real banquet of all the good
things their country produced. The warriors had gone on
ahead and dispersed in every direction, some to hunt and
others to fish. The latter only succeeded in catching a
single trout. The warriors returned in the evening with a
bear, goose, and six swan's eggs. "Sed quid hoc inter
tantos." The fish and goose were roasted before a good
fire, and the whole mess was soon presented to me. Most
of my companions preferring to fast, I expressed my regret
at it, consoling them however by telling them that God
would certainly reward their kindness to me. A moment
after we heard the last hunter returning, whom we thought
had gone back to the camp. Hope shone on every countenance.
The warrior soon appeared laden with a large elk,
and hunger that night was banished from the camp. Each
one began to occupy himself; some cut up the animal,
others heaped fuel on the fire, and prepared sticks and spits
to roast the meat. The feast which had commenced under
such poor auspices continued a great part of the night. The
whole animal, excepting a small piece that was reserved
for my breakfast, had disappeared before they retired to
sleep. This is a sample of savage life. The Indian when
he has nothing to eat does not complain, but in the midst
of abundance he knows no moderation. The stomach of
a savage has always been to me a riddle.

The plain that commands a view of the lake is one of
the 205 most fertile in the mountainous regions. The
Flat Head river runs through it and extends more than 200
miles to the North East. It is wide and deep, abounding[Pg 360]
with fish and lined with wood, principally with the cotton,
aspen, pine and birch. There are beautiful sites for villages,
but the vicinity of the Black Feet must delay for a long while
the good work, as they are only at two day's march from
the great district occupied by these brigands, from whence
they often issue to pay their neighbours predatory visits.
A second obstacle would be the great distance from any post
of the Hudson Bay Company; consequently the difficulty
of procuring what is strictly necessary. The lake is highly
romantic, and is from 40 to 50 miles long. Mountainous
and rocky islands of all sizes are scattered over its bosom,
which present an enchanting prospect. These islands are
filled with wild horses. Lofty mountains surround the
lake and rise from its very brink.

On the 16th of April, after bidding adieu to my travelling
companions, I started early in the morning, accompanied
by two Canadians and two savages. That evening we encamped
close to a delightful spring, which was warm and
sulphurous;[263] having travelled a distance of about fifty
miles. When the savages reach this spring they generally
bathe in it. They told me that after the fatigues of a long
journey they find that bathing in this water greatly refreshes
them. I found here ten lodges of the Kalispel tribe; the
chief, who was by birth of the Pierced Nose tribe, invited
me to spend the night in his wigwam, where he treated me
most hospitably. This was the only small Kalispel camp
that I had as yet met in my journeys. I here established,
as I have done wherever I stopped, the custom of morning
and evening prayers. During the evening the chief who
had looked very gloomy, made a public exposition of 206
his whole life. "Black Gown," said he, "you find yourself[Pg 361]
in the lodge of a most wicked and unhappy man; all
the evil that a man could do on earth, I believe I have been
guilty of: I have even assassinated several of my near relations;
since then, there is nought in my heart but trouble,
bitterness and remorse. Why does not the Great Spirit
annihilate me? I still possess life, but there will be neither
pardon nor mercy for me after death." These words and
the feeling manner with which they were addressed to me
drew tears of compassion from my eyes. "Poor, unfortunate
man," I replied, "you are really to be pitied, but you increase
your misery by thinking that you cannot obtain
pardon. The devil, man's evil spirit, is the author of this
bad thought. Do not listen to him, for he would wish
to precipitate you into that bad place (hell). The Great
Spirit who created you is a Father infinitely good and merciful.
He does not desire the death of the sinner, but rather
that he should be converted and live. He receives us into
his favour and forgets our crimes, notwithstanding their
number and enormity, the moment we return to Him contrite
and repentant. He will also forgive you if you walk
in the path which His only Son, Jesus Christ, came on
earth to trace for us." I then recounted the instance of the
good thief and the parable of the prodigal son. I made him
sensible of the proof of God's goodness in sending me to
him. I added that perhaps his life was drawing to a close,
and that he might be in danger of falling into the bad place
on account of his sins; that I would show him the right
path, which if he followed he would certainly reach Heaven.
These few words were as balm poured on his wounded
spirit. He became calmer, and joy and hope appeared on
his countenance. "Black Gown," said he, "your words
re-animate me: I see, I understand better now, you have
207 consoled me, you have relieved me from a burden that
was crushing me with its weight, for I thought myself lost.[Pg 362]
I will follow your directions; I will learn how to pray. Yes,
I feel convinced that the Great Spirit will have pity on me."
There was fortunately in the camp a young man who knew
all the prayers, and was willing to serve as his catechist.
His baptism was deferred until the autumn or winter.

The results of my visit to the Pointed Hearts were very
consoling. They form a small but interesting tribe, animated
with much fervour.

As soon as they were certain of my visit, they deputed
couriers in every direction to inform the savages of the
approach of the Black-gown; and all, without exception,
assembled at the outlet of the great lake which bears their
name, and which was the place I had indicated.[264] An
ingenuous joy, joined to wonder and contentment, shone
on every face when they saw me arrive in the midst of
them. Every one hastened to greet me. It was the first
visit of the kind they had received, and the following is the
order they observed. Their chiefs and old men marched
at the head; next came the young men and boys; then
followed the women       mothers, young girls, and little
children. I was conducted in triumph by this multitude
to the lodge of the great chief. Here, as every where else
in the Indian country, the everlasting calumet was first
produced, which went round two or three times in the
most profound silence. The chief then addressed me,
saying: "Black-gown you are most welcome amongst us.
We thank you for your charity towards us. For a long
time we have wished to see you, and hear the words which
will give us understanding. Our fathers invoked the
sun and earth. I recollect very well when the knowledge[Pg 363]
of the true and one God came amongst them; since which
time we have offered 208 to Him our prayers and vows.
We are however to be pitied. We do not know the word
of the Great Spirit. All is darkness as yet to us, but to-day
I hope we shall see the light shine. Speak, Black-gown,
I have done       every one is anxious to hear you." I
spoke to them for two hours on salvation and end of man's
creation, and not one person stirred from his place the
whole time of the instruction. As it was almost sunset,
I recited the prayers that I had translated into their language
a few days before. After which I took some refreshments,
consisting of fragments of dried meat, and a piece of cooked
moss, tasting like soap, and as black as pitch. All this
however was as grateful to my palate as though it had
been honey and sugar, not having eaten a mouthful since
day-break. At their own request I then continued instructing
the chiefs and their people until the night was far advanced.
About every half hour I paused, and then the pipes would
pass around to refresh the listeners and give time for
reflection. It was during these intervals that the chiefs
conversed on what they had heard, and instructed and
advised their followers. On awakening the next morning,
I was surprised to find my lodge already filled with people.
They had entered so quietly that I had not heard them.
It was hardly day-break when I arose, and they all following
my example, placed themselves on their knees,
and we made together the offering of our hearts to God,
with that of the actions of the day. After this the Chief
said: "Black-gown, we come here very early to observe
you       we wish to imitate what you do. Your prayer
is good; we wish to adopt it. But you will leave us after
two nights more, and we have no one to teach us in your
absence." I had the bell rung for morning prayers, promising
him at the same time that the prayers should be[Pg 364]
known before I left them. 209 After a long instruction on
the most important truths of religion, I collected around
me all the little children, with the young boys and girls;
I chose two from among the latter, to whom I taught the
Hail Mary, assigning to each one his own particular part;
then seven for the Our Father; ten others for the Commandments,
and twelve for the Apostles' Creed. This
method, which was my first trial of it, succeeded admirably.
I repeated to each one his part until he knew it
perfectly; I then made him repeat it five or six times.
These little Indians, forming a triangle, resembled a choir
of angels, and recited their prayers, to the great astonishment
and satisfaction of the savages. They continued
in this manner morning and night, until one of the chiefs
learned all the prayers, which he then repeated in public.
I spent three days in instructing them. I would have
remained longer, but the savages were without provisions.
There was scarcely enough for one person in the whole
camp. My own provisions were nearly out, and I was
still four days' journey from Fort Colville. The second
day of my stay among them, I baptized all their small
children, and then twenty-four adults, who were infirm
and very old. It appeared as though God had retained
these good old people on earth to grant them the inexpressible
happiness of receiving the sacrament of baptism
before their death. They seemed by their transports of
joy and gratitude at this moment, to express that sentiment
of the Scripture: "My soul is ready, O God, my
soul is ready." Never did I experience in my visits to
the savages so much satisfaction as on this occasion, not
even when I visited the Flat Heads in 1840; nor have
I elsewhere seen more convincing proofs of sincere conversion
to God. May He grant them to persevere in
their virtuous resolutions. Rev. Father Point intends[Pg 365]
passing the winter 210 with them to confirm them in
their faith.[265] After some advice and salutary regulations,
I left this interesting colony, and I must acknowledge, with
heartfelt regret. The great chief allowed himself scarcely
a moment's repose for three nights I spent amongst them;
he would rise from time to time to harangue the
people, and repeat to them all he was able to remember
of the instructions of the day. During the whole time
of my mission, he continued at my side, so anxious was
he not to lose a single word. The old chief, now in his
eightieth year, was baptized by the name of Jesse. In
the spring the territory of this tribe enchants the traveller
who may happen to traverse it. It is so diversified with
noble plains, and enamelled with flowers, whose various
forms and colors offer to experienced botanists an interesting
parterre. These plains are surrounded by magnificent
forests of pine, fir and cedar. To the west their
country is open, and the view extends over several days'
journey. To the south, east and north, you see towering
mountains, ridge rising above ridge, robed with snow,
and mingling their summits with the clouds, from which,
at a distance, you can hardly distinguish them. The
lake forms a striking feature in this beautiful prospect,
and is about thirty miles in circumference. It is deep,
and abounds in fish, particularly in salmon trout, common
trout, carp, and a small, oily fish, very delicious, and tasting
like the smelt. The Spokan river rises in the lake, and
crosses the whole plain of the C      ur d'Alènes. The valley[Pg 366]
that borders above the lake is from four to five miles wide,
exceedingly fertile, and the soil from ten to fifteen feet
deep. Every spring, at the melting of the snow, it is
subject to inundations, which scarcely ever last longer
than four or five days; at the same time augmenting,
as in Egypt, the fertility of the soil. The potatoe grows
here very well, and in great abundance. 211 The Spokan
river is wide, swift and deep in the spring, and contains,
like all the rivers of Oregon, many rapid falls and cascades.[266]
The navigation of the waters of this immense
territory is generally dangerous, and few risk themselves
on them without being accompanied by experienced pilots.
In descending Clark's river, we passed by some truly
perilous and remarkable places, where the pilots have full
opportunity to exhibit their dexterity and prudence. The
rapids are numerous, and the roar of the waters incessant,
the current sweeping on at the rate of ten or twelve miles
an hour; the rugged banks and projecting rocks creating
waves resembling those of the troubled sea. The skilful
pilot mounts the waves, which seem ready to engulf us,
the canoe speeds over the agitated waters, and with the
aid of the paddle, skilfully plied, bears us unharmed through
numberless dangers. The most remarkable spot on this
river is called the cabinets; it consists of four apartments,
which you have hardly time to examine, as you are scarcely
half a minute passing by them.[267] Represent to yourself[Pg 367]
chasms between two rocky mountains of a stupendous
height, the river pent in between them in a bed of thirty
or forty feet, precipitating itself down its rocky channel
with irresistible fury, roaring against its jagged sides,
and whitening with foam all around it. In a short space
it winds in four different directions, resembling very much,
forked lightning. It requires very great skill, activity,
and presence of mind, to extricate yourself from this difficult
pass. The Spokan lands are sandy, gravelly, and
badly calculated for agriculture. The section over which
I travelled consisted of immense plains of light, dry, and
sandy soil, and thin forests of gum pines. We saw nothing
in this noiseless solitude but a buck, running quickly from
us, and disappearing 212 almost immediately. From time
to time, the melancholy and piercing cry of the wood snipe
increased the gloomy thoughts which this sad spot
occasioned. Here, on a gay and smiling little plain, two
ministers have settled themselves, with their wives, who had
consented to share their husbands' soi-disant apostolical
labors.[268] During the four years they have spent here, they[Pg 368]
have baptized several of their own children. They cultivate
a small farm, large enough, however, for their own
maintenance and the support of their animals and fowls. It
appears they are fearful that, should they cultivate more,
they might have too frequent visits from the savages. They
even try to prevent their encampment in their immediate
neighborhood, and therefore they see and converse but
seldom with the heathens, whom they have come so far
to seek. A band of Spokans received me with every
demonstration of friendship, and were enchanted to hear
that the right kind of Black-gowns intended soon to form
an establishment in the vicinity. I baptized one of their
little children who was dying.

It was in these parts that in 1836 a modern Iconoclast,
named Parker, broke down a cross erected over the grave of
a child by some Catholic Iroquois, telling us emphatically,
in the narrative of his journey, that he did not wish to leave
in that country an emblem of idolatry.[269]

Poor man!       not to know better in this enlightened age!
Were he to return to these mountains, he would hear the
praises of the Holy Name of Jesus resounding among them;[Pg 369]
he would hear the Catholics chaunting the love and mercies
of God from the rivers, lakes, mountains, prairies, forests
and coasts of the Columbia. He would behold the Cross
planted from shore to shore for the space of a thousand
miles       on the loftiest height of the Pointed Heart territory,
213 on the towering chain which separates the waters of
the Missouri from the Columbia rivers; in the plains of the
Wallamette, Cowlitz and Bitter Root       and, whilst I am
writing to you, the Rev. Mr. Demers is occupied in planting
this same sacred symbol amongst the different tribes of New
Caledonia.[270] The words of Him who said that this holy
sign would draw all men to Himself, begin to be verified with
regard to the poor destitute sheep of this vast continent.
Were he who destroyed that solitary, humble Cross now to
return, he would find the image of Jesus Christ crucified,
borne on the breast of more than 4000 Indians; and the
smallest child would say to him: "Mr. Parker, we do not
adore the cross; do not break it, because it reminds us of
Jesus Christ who died on the cross to save us       we adore
God alone."

In the beginning of May I arrived at Fort Colville on
the Colville river; this year the snow melted away very
early. The mountain torrents had overflowed, and the
small rivers that usually moved quietly along in the month
of April, had suddenly left their beds and assumed the appearance
of large rivers and lakes, completely flooding all
the lowlands. This rendered my journey to Vancouver by
land impossible, and induced me to wait, nolens volens, at[Pg 370]
the Fort, for the construction of the barges which were not
ready until the 30th of the same month, when I was again
able to pursue my journey on the river. On the same day
that I arrived among the Shuyelpi or Chaudiere tribe, who
resided near the Fort, I undertook to translate our prayers
into their language. This kept me only one day as their
language is nearly the same as that of the Flat Heads and
Kalispels, having the same origin. They were all very
attentive in attending my instructions, and the old, as well
as the young, tried assiduously to learn their prayers. I
214 baptized all the younger children who had not received
the sacrament before, for Mr. Demers had already made
two excursions amongst them, with the most gratifying
success. The great chief and his wife had long sighed for
baptism, which holy sacrament I administered to them,
naming them Martin and Mary. This chief is one of the
most intelligent and pious I have become acquainted with.

The work of God does not, however, proceed without contradictions;
it is necessary to prepare oneself for them beforehand
when undertaking any enterprise amongst the tribes.
I have had some hard trials in all my visits. I expected
them, when on the 13th of May, I started to see the Okinakane
tribe, who were desirous to meet a priest.[271] The
interpreter, Charles, and the chief of the Shuyelpi, wished
to accompany me. In crossing the Columbia river my mule
returned to the shore, and ran at full speed into the forest;[Pg 371]
Charles pursued her, and two hours afterwards I was told
that he had been found dead in the prairie. I hastened immediately,
and perceived from a distance a great gathering
of people. I soon reached the spot where he was lying, and,
to my great joy, perceived that he gave signs of life. He was
however, senseless, and in a most pitiful state. A copious
bleeding and some days of rest restored him and we resumed
our journey. This time the mule had a large rope tied
around her neck, and we crossed the river without any
accidents; we took a narrow path that led us by mountains,
valleys, forests and prairies, following the course of the
river Sharameep.[272] Towards evening we were on the borders
of a deep impetuous torrent, having no other bridge
than a tree which was rather slight and in constant motion
from the rushing of the waters. It reminded me of the
bridge of souls spoken of in the Potowattamie legends.
These savages believe that souls must traverse this bridge
215 before they reach their elysium in the west. The good,
they say, pass over it without danger; the bad, on the contrary,
are unable to hold on, but stumble, stagger and fall
into the torrent below, which sweeps them off into a labyrinth
of lakes and marshes; here they drag out their existence;
wretched, tormented by famine and in great agony,
the living prey of all sorts of venomous reptiles and ferocious
animals, wandering to and fro without ever being able
to escape. We were fortunate enough to cross the trembling
bridge without accident. We soon pitched our camp on
the other side, and in spite of the warring waves which
in falls and cascades thundered all night by our side, we
enjoyed a refreshing sleep. The greater part of the next day
the path conducted us through a thick and hilly forest of[Pg 372]
fir trees; the country then became more undulating and
open. From time to time we perceived an Indian burial
ground, remarkable only for the posts erected on the graves,
and hung with kettles, wooden plates, guns, bows and arrows,
left there by the nearest relatives of the deceased       humble
tokens of their grief and friendship.

We encamped on the shore of a small lake called the
Sharrameep,[273] where was a Shuyelpi village; I gave these
savages several instructions and baptized their infants. At
my departure the whole village accompanied me. The
country over which we travelled is open; the soil, sterile
and sandy, and the different chains of mountains that traverse
it seem to be nothing but sharp pointed rocks, thinly
covered with cedars and pines. Towards evening we came
up with the men of the first Okinakane encampment, who
received us with the greatest cordiality and joy. The chief
who came out to meet us was quite conspicuous, being arrayed
in his court dress       a shirt made of a horse skin, the
hair of which was outside, the mane partly on his 216 chest
and back, giving him a truly fantastic and savage appearance.
The camp also joined us, and the fact of my arrival having
been soon noised abroad in every direction, we saw, issuing
from the defiles and narrow passes of the mountains, bands
of Indians who had gone forth to gather their harvest of roots.
Many sick were presented to me for baptism, of which rite
they already knew the importance. Before reaching the rendezvous
assigned us, on the borders of the Okinakane lake,
I was surrounded by more than 200 horsemen, and more than
200 others were already in waiting.[274] We recited together[Pg 373]
night prayers, and all listened with edifying attention to the
instruction I gave them. The interpreter and Martin continued
the religious conversation until the night was far advanced;
they manifested the same anxiety to hear the word
of God that the Stiel Shoi had shown.[275] All the next day
was spent in prayer, instructions and hymns       I baptized
106 children and some old people, and in conclusion named
the plain where these consoling scenes occurred, the "plain
of prayer." It would be impossible for me to give you an
idea of the piety, the happiness of these men, who are thirsting
for the life-giving waters of the Divine word. How
much good a missionary could do, who would reside in the
midst of a people who are so desirous of receiving instruction,
and correspond so faithfully with the grace of God. After
some regulations and advice, I left this interesting people,
and pursuing my journey for three days over mountains
and through dense forests, arrived safely at Fort Colville.

Amongst the innumerable rivers that traverse the American
continent, and afford means of communication between
its most distant portions, the Columbia river is one of the
most remarkable, not only on account of its great importance,
217 west of the mountains, but also from the
dangers that attend its navigation. At some distance from
the Pacific ocean, crossing a territory which exhibits, in
several localities, evident marks of former volcanic eruptions,
its course is frequently impeded by rapids, by chains
of volcanic rocks, and immense detached masses of the
same substance which, in many places, obstruct the bed of
the river.[276]

[Pg 374]

I embarked on this river, on the 30th of May, in one of
the barges of the Hudson Bay Company; Mr. Ogden, one
of the principal proprietors, offered me a place in his. I
shall never forget the kindness and friendly manner with
which this gentleman treated me throughout the journey,
nor the many agreeable hours I spent in his company. I
found his conversation instructive, his anecdotes and bon
mots entertaining and timely; it was with great regret that
I parted from him.[277] I will not detain you with a description
of the rapids, falls and cascades, which I saw on this
celebrated river; for, from its source in the mountains to
the cascades it is but a succession of dangers. I will endeavour,
however, to give you some idea of one of its largest
rapids, called by the Canadian travellers, "great dalles."[278]
A dalle is a place where the current is confined to a channel
between two steep rocks, forming a prolonged narrow
torrent, but of extraordinary force and swiftness. Here
the river is divided into several channels separated from
one another by masses of rocks, which rise abruptly above
its surface. Some of these channels are navigable at certain
seasons of the year, although with very great risk, even to
the most experienced pilot. But when, after the melting of
the snow, the river rises above its usual level, the waters
in most of these channels make but one body, and the whole
mass of these united streams descend with irresistible fury.
At this season the most courageous dare not encounter 218
such dangers, and all navigation is discontinued. In this
state the river flows with an imposing grandeur and majesty,
which no language can describe. It seems at one moment[Pg 375]
to stay its progress; then leaps forward with resistless impetuosity,
and then rebounds against the rock-girt islands
of which I have already spoken, but which present only
vain obstructions to its headlong course. If arrested for a
moment, its accumulated waters proudly swell and mount
as though instinct with life, and the next moment dash triumphantly
on, enveloping the half smothered waves that
preceded them as if impatient of their sluggish course, and
wild to speed them on their way. Along the shore, on every
projecting point, the Indian fisherman takes his stand,
spreading in the eddies his ingeniously worked net, and in
a short time procures for himself an abundant supply of fine
fish. Attracted by the shoals of fish that come up the river,
the seals gambol amid the eddying waves       now floating
with their heads above the river's breast, and anon darting
in the twinkling of an eye from side to side, in sportive joy
or in swift pursuit of their scaly prey. But this noble river
has far other recollections associated with it. Never shall
I forget the sad and fatal accident which occurred on the
second day of our voyage, at a spot called the "little dalles."
I had gone ashore and was walking along the bank, scarcely
thinking what might happen; for my breviary, papers, bed, in
a word, my little all, had been left in the barge.[279] I had proceeded
about a quarter of a mile, when seeing the bargemen
push off from the bank and glide down the stream with an
easy, careless air, I began to repent having preferred a path
along the river's side, so strewn with fragments of rocks that
I was compelled at every instant to turn aside or clamber
over them. I still held on my course, when all at once, the
barge 219 is so abruptly stopped that the rowers can hardly[Pg 376]
keep their seats. Regaining, however, their equilibrium,
they ply the oars with redoubled vigour, but without any
effect upon the barge. They are already within the power
of the angry vortex: the waters are crested with foam; a deep
sound is heard which I distinguish as the voice of the pilot
encouraging his men to hold to their oars       to row bravely.
The danger increases every minute, and in a moment more
all hope of safety has vanished. The barge       the sport of
the vortex, spins like a top upon the whirling waters       the
oars are useless       the bow rises       the stern descends, and
the next instant all have disappeared. A death-like chill
shot through my frame       a dimness came over my sight,
as the cry "we are lost!" rung in my ears, and told but too
plainly that my companions were buried beneath the waves.
Overwhelmed with grief and utterly unable to afford them
the slightest assistance, I stood a motionless spectator of
this tragic scene. All were gone, and yet upon the river's
breast there was not the faintest trace of their melancholy
fate. Soon after the whirlpool threw up, in various directions,
the oars, poles, the barge capsized, and every lighter
article it had contained. Here and there I beheld the unhappy
bargemen vainly struggling in the midst of the vortex.
Five of them sunk never to rise again. My interpreter had
twice touched bottom and after a short prayer was thrown
upon the bank. An Iroquois saved himself by means of my
bed; and a third was so fortunate as to seize the handle of
an empty trunk, which helped him to sustain himself above
water until he reached land. The rest of our journey was
more fortunate. We stopped at Forts Okinakane and
Wallawalla,[280] where I baptized several children.

The savages who principally frequent the borders of the
Columbia river are from the lakes; the chief of whom, with[Pg 377]
220 several of the nation, have been baptized; also the
Shuyelpi or Chaudieres, the Okinakanes, Cingpoils, Walla-wallas,
Pierced Noses, Kayuses, Attayes, Spokanes, the
Indians from the falls and cascades, and the Schinouks and
Classops.[281]

We arrived at Fort Vancouver on the morning of the 8th
June. I enjoyed the happiness and great consolation of
meeting in these distant parts, two respectable Canadian
priests       the Rev. Mr. Blanchet, grand vicar of all the countries
west of the mountains claimed by the British crown,
and the Rev. Mr. Demers. They are laboring in these regions
for the same object that we are trying to accomplish
in the Rocky Mountains. The kindness and benevolence
with which these Reverend gentlemen received me are proofs
of the pure zeal which actuates them for the salvation of
these savages. They assured me that immense good might
be done in the extensive regions that border on the Pacific,
if a greater number of Missionaries, with means at their
command, were stationed in these regions; and they urged
me very strongly to obtain from my Superiors some of our
Fathers. I will try to give you in my next some extracts
from the letters of these Missionaries, which will make the
country known to you, its extent, and the progress of their
mission. The Governor of the Honorable Company of
Hudson Bay, Dr. McLaughlin, who resides at Fort Vancouver,
after having given me every possible proof of interest,
as a good Catholic, advised me to do every thing in my power[Pg 378]
to gratify the wishes of the Canadian Missionaries. His
principal reason is, that if Catholicity was rapidly planted in
these tracts where civilization begins to dawn, it would be
more quickly introduced thence into the interior. Already
a host of ministers have overrun a part of the country, and
have settled wherever they may derive 221 some advantages
for the privations their philanthropy imposes on them.
Such is the state of these regions of the new world, as yet so
little known: you perceive that our prospects are by no means
discouraging. Permit me therefore to repeat the great
principle you have so often recommended to me, and which
I have not forgotten: "Courage and confidence in God!"
With the mercy of God, the church of Jesus Christ may soon
have the consolation of seeing her standard planted in these
distant lands on the ruins of idolatry and of the darkest superstition.
Pray then that the Lord of such a rich harvest may
send us numerous fellow laborers; for in so extensive a
field we are but five, and beset with so many dangers, that at
the dawn of day we have often reason to doubt whether we
will live to see the sun go down. It is not that we have any
thing to fear from the climate; far from it       for, if here death
came only by sickness, we might indeed count upon many
years, but water, fire, and the bow, often hurry their victims
off when least expected. Of a hundred men who inhabit this
country, there are not ten who do not die by some or other
fatal accident. The afternoon of the 30th June I resumed
my place in one of the barges of the English Company,
and took my leave of the worthy and respectable Governor.       To
my great joy I found that the Rev. Mr. Demers was
one of the passengers, being about to undertake an apostolic
excursion among the different tribes of New Caledonia,
who, according to the accounts of several Canadian travellers,
were most anxious to see a Blackgown, and hear the
word of God. The wind being favorable, the sails of the[Pg 379]
barge were unfurled and the sailors plying their oars at the
same time, the 11th of July saw us landed safely at Fort
Wallawalla. The next day I parted, with many regrets,
from my esteemed friends, Rev. Mr. Demers, and Mr. 222
Ogden. Accompanied only by my interpreter, we continued
our land route to the 19th, through woods and immense
plains. The high plains which separate the waters of the
Snake river from those of the Spokan, offer some natural
curiosities. I fancied myself in the vicinity of several fortified
cities, surrounded by walls and small forts, scattered in
different directions. The pillars are regular pentagons,
from two to four feet in diameter, erect, joined together,
forming a wall from forty to eighty feet high, and extending
several miles in the form of squares and triangles, detached
from one another, and in different directions.[282] On our
road we met some Pierced Noses, and a small band of Spokanes,
who accosted us with many demonstrations of friendship,
and although very poor, offered us more salmon than
we could carry. The Pointed Hearts (a tribe which shall
ever be dear to me) came to meet us, and great was the joy
on both sides, on beholding one another again. They had
strictly observed all the rules I had laid down for them at my
first visit. They accompanied me for three days, to the
very limits of their territory. We then planted a cross on the
summit of a high mountain, covered with snow, and after the
example of the Flat Heads, all the people consecrated themselves
inviolably to the service of God. We remained there
that night. The next morning, after reciting our prayers in[Pg 380]
common, and giving them a long exhortation, we bade them
farewell. The 20th I continued my journey over terrific
mountains, steep rocks, and through apparently impenetrable
forests. I could scarcely believe that any human
being had ever preceded us over such a road. At the end
of four days' journey, replete with fatigue and difficulties,
we reached the borders of the Bitter Root river, and on the
evening of the 27th I had the happiness of arriving safely at
St. 223 Mary's, and of finding my dear brethren in good
health.       The Flat Heads, accompanied by Father Point,
had left the village ten days before, to procure provisions.
A few had remained to guard the camp, and their families
awaited my return. The 29th, I started to rejoin the Flat
Heads on the Missouri river. We ascended the Bitter Root
to its source, and the 1st of August, having clambered up a
high mountain, we planted a cross on its very summit, near a
beautiful spring, one of the sources of the Missouri.[283] The
next day, after a forced march, we joined the camp where
we had such a budget of news to open, so many interesting
facts to communicate to each other, that we sat up a greater
part of the night. The Rev. Father Point and myself, accompanied
our dear neophytes, who to obtain their daily
bread, are obliged to hunt the buffalo, even over the lands
of their most inveterate enemies, the Black Feet. On the
15th of August, the feast of the Assumption, (the same on
which this letter is dated) I offered up the sacrifice of the
Mass, in a noble plain, watered by one of the three streams
that form the head waters of the Missouri, to thank God for
all the blessings He had bestowed on us during this last year.
I had the consolation of seeing fifty Flat Heads approach
the holy table in so humble, modest and devout a manner,[Pg 381]
that to my, perhaps partial eye, they resembled angels more
than men. On the same day I determined, for the interest
of this mission, which seems so absolutely to require it, to
traverse for the fourth time the dangerous American desert.
If heaven preserves me, (for I have to travel through a region
infested by thousands of hostile savages) I will send you the
account of this last journey.       You see then, Rev. Father,
that in these deserts we must more than ever keep our souls
prepared to render the fearful account, in consequence of
the perils that surround us; and 224 as it would be desirable
that we could be replaced immediately, in case of any accident
occurring       again I say to you, pray that the Lord
may send us fellow laborers. "Rogate ergo Dominum
messis ut mittat operarios in messem suam." And thousands
of souls, who would otherwise be lost, will bless you
one day in eternity. Rev. Father Point has expressed a
desire to be sent amongst the Blackfeet. Until they are
willing to listen to the word of God, which I think will be
before long, he intends to preach the gospel to the Pointed
Hearts and the neighboring tribes. I trust we shall be able
to make as cheering a report of these as we have already
done of our first neophytes. I have found them all in the
best dispositions. The Rev. Father Mengarini remains with
the Flatheads and Pends d'oreilles. On my first journey,
in the autumn of 1841, which ended at Fort Colville, I
baptized 190 persons of the Kalispel tribe. On my visit, last
spring, to the various distant tribes, (of which I have just
finished giving you the account) I had the consolation of baptizing
418 persons, 60 of whom were of the Pends d'oreille
tribe of the great lake; 82 of the K      tnays or Skalzi; 100 of
the Pointed Hearts; 56 of the Shuyelpi; 106 of the Okenakanes,
and 14 in the Okenakanes and Wallawalla Forts.       These,
with 500 baptized last year, in different parts of the
country, mostly amongst the Flat Heads and Kalispels, and[Pg 382]
196 that I baptized on Christmas day, at St. Mary's, with
the 350 baptized by Rev. Fathers Mengarini and Point,
make a total of 1654 souls, wrested from the power of
the devil. For what the Scripture calls the "spirit of the
world" has not wherewith to introduce itself amongst them.
These poor people find their happiness even in this world
in the constant practice of their Christian duties. We may
almost say of them, that all who are baptized are saved.       225
Since God has inspired you with a zealous desire to
second the views of the Association for the Propagation of
the Faith, entreat those pious persons to whom you may
communicate your designs, to redouble their prayers in our
behalf. I conclude by beseeching you earnestly to remember
me frequently and fervently in the Holy Sacrifice.

I remain, very Rev. and dear Father,


Your affectionate servant
and brother in Christ,
P. J. De Smet, S.J.





LETTER XIV


St. Mary, June 28th, 1842.

Rev. Father:


Thanks be to God, our hopes have at length begun to be
realized; the tender blossom has been succeeded by precious
fruit, daily more and more visible in our colony; the
chief and people, by their truly edifying conduct, give us
already the sweetest consolation. Pentecost was for us and
for our beloved neophytes a day of blessings, of holy exultation.
Eighty of them enjoyed the happiness of partaking
for the first time of the bread of Angels. Their assiduity in
assisting during a month at the instructions we gave them,
three times a day, had assured us of their zeal and favor;[Pg 383]
but a retreat of three days, which served as a more immediate
preparation, contributed still more to convince us of their
sincerity. From an early hour in the morning repeated discharges
of musketry announced afar the arrival of the great,
the glorious day. At the first sound of the bell a crowd of
savages hurried towards our church. One of our Fathers,
in a surplice and stole, preceded by three choristers, one of
whom bore aloft the banner of the Sacred Heart of Jesus,
went out to receive them, and conduct them in procession,
and to the sound of joyous canticles, into the Temple of the
Lord. What piety       what religious recollection, amidst
that throng! They observed a strict silence, but at the
same time the joy and gladness that filled their hearts, shone
on their happy countenances. The ardent love which already
animated 227 these innocent hearts, was inflamed afresh
by the fervent aspirations to the adorable Sacrament,
which were recited aloud by one of our Fathers, who also
intermingled occasionally some stanzas of canticles. The
tender devotion, and the profound faith with which these
Indians received their God, really edified and affected us.
That morning at 11 o'clock they renewed their baptismal
vows, and in the afternoon they made the solemn consecration
of their hearts to the Blessed Virgin, the tutelar patroness
of this place.       May these pious sentiments which the
true religion alone could inspire, be preserved amongst our
dear children. We hope for their continuance, and what
increases our hope is, that at the time of this solemnity,
about one hundred and twenty persons approached the
tribunal of penance, and since that truly memorable occasion,
we have from thirty to forty communions, and from
fifty to sixty confessions every Sunday.

The feast of Corpus Christi was solemnized by another
ceremony not less touching, and calculated to perpetuate
the gratitude and devotion of our pious Indians towards our[Pg 384]
amiable Queen. This was the solemn erection of a statue
to the Blessed Virgin, in memory of her apparition to little
Paul. The following is a brief account of the ceremony.
From the entrance of our chapel to the spot where little
Paul received such a special favor       the avenue was simply
the green sward, the length of which on both sides was
bordered by garlands, hung in festoons       triumphal arches,
gracefully arranged, arose at regular distances. At the end
of the avenue, and in the middle of a kind of repository,
stood the pedestal, which was destined to receive the statue.
The hour specified having struck, the procession issued
from the chapel in this order. At the head was borne
aloft the banner of the Sacred Heart 228 followed closely
by little Paul carrying the statue and accompanied by two
choristers, who profusely strewed the way with flowers.
Then came the two Fathers, one vested in a cope, and the
other in a surplice.       Finally the march was closed by the
chiefs and all the members of the colony emulating each
other in their zeal to pay their tribute of thanksgiving and
praise to their blessed Mother. When they reached the
spot one of our Fathers, in a short exhortation, in which he
reminded them of the signal prodigy and assistance of the
Queen of Heaven, encouraged our dear neophytes to sentiments
of confidence in the protection of Mary. After this
address and the singing of the Litany of the Blessed Virgin,
the procession returned in the same order to the church.
Oh! how ardently we desired that all the friends of our holy
religion could have witnessed the devotion and recollection
of these new children of Mary. It was also our intention
not to dismiss them until we had given them the Benediction
of the Blessed Sacrament, but unfortunately not possessing
a Remonstrance we were obliged to defer this beautiful ceremony
until the Feast of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. At that
time the Sacred Host was carried in solemn procession, and[Pg 385]
since then each Sunday after Vespers, the faithful enjoy the
happiness of receiving the Benediction.

May the blessing of God really descend upon us and our
colony. We hope for it through the assistance of your
prayers and those of all our friends.


I remain, Rev. Father,
Your very humble friend and servant,
Greg. Mengarini, S.J.





LETTER XV


Fort Vancouver, 28th September, 1841.

Reverend Father:


Blessed be the Divine Providence of the all-powerful
God who has protected, preserved and restored you safely
to your dear neophytes.

I congratulate the country upon the inestimable treasure
it possesses by the arrival and establishment therein of the
members of the Society of Jesus. Be so kind as to express
to the Reverend Fathers and Brothers my profound veneration
and respect for them. I beg of God to bless your
labours and to continue your successful efforts. In a few
years you will enjoy the glory and consolation of beholding
through your means all the savages residing on the head
waters of the Columbia, ranging themselves under the standard
of the Cross. I do not doubt but that our excellent
governor, Dr. McLaughlin, will give you all the assistance
in his power. It is very fortunate for our holy religion,
that this noble-hearted man should be at the head of the
affairs of the honorable Hudson Bay Company, west of the
Rocky Mountains. He protected it before our arrival in
these regions. He still gives it his support by word and
example, and many favors. As we are in the same country,[Pg 386]
aiming at the same end, namely, the triumph of the
holy Catholic faith throughout this vast territory, the
Rev. Mr. Demers and myself will always take the most
lively interest in your welfare and progress, and we are 230
convinced that, whatever concerns us will equally interest
you. The following is an account of our present situation:

The Catholic establishment of Wallamette consists of
nearly 80 families. The one at Cowlitz of only five,       twenty-two
at Nez-quale on Puget-sound, which is from 25
to 30 leagues above Cowlitz.[284] Besides these stations we
visit from time to time, the nearest Forts where the Catholics
in the service of the Hudson Bay Company reside. This
is what takes up almost all our time. We are much in want
of lay brothers and nuns, of school masters and mistresses.
We have to attend to every spiritual as well as temporal
affair, which is a great burden to us. The wives of the
Canadians, taken from every quarter of the country, cause
throughout the families a diversity of languages. They
speak almost generally a rude jargon of which we can
scarcely make any use in our public instructions       hence
proceed the obstacles to our progress,       we go along slowly.
We are obliged to teach them French and their catechism[Pg 387]
together, which occasions much delay. We are really overwhelmed
with business. The savages apply to us from all
sides. Some of them are indifferent, and we have not time
to instruct them. We make them, occasionally, hasty visits,
and baptize the children and the adults who happen to be
in danger of death. But we have no time to learn their
languages, and until now have been without an interpreter
to translate the prayers we wish them to learn. It is only
lately that I have succeeded in translating them into the
Tchinoux language. Our difficulties are greatly increased
by this variety of languages; each of the following tribes has
a different dialect: The Kalapouyas, towards the head
waters of the Wallamette,[285] the Tchinoux of the Columbia
river; the Kaijous from Walla-walla; the Pierced Noses,
Okanakanes, Flat Heads, Snakes, Cowlitz, the 231
Klickatates from the interior, north of Vancouver;[286] the
Tcheheles, to the north of the mouth of the Columbia river;
the Nezquales,[287] and those from the interior or of the Puget
sound Bay, those of the Travers river, the Khalams[288]
of the above mentioned bay, those of Vancouver Island, and
those from the northern posts on the sea shore, and from[Pg 388]
the interior of the part of the country watered by the
tributary streams of the Travers river, all have their different
languages.

Such are the difficulties we have daily to overcome. Our
hearts bleed at the sight of so many souls who are lost
under our eyes, without our being able to carry to them
the word of Life. Moreover, our temporal resources are
limited. We are but two, and our trunks did not arrive
last spring by the vessel belonging to the honorable Hudson
Bay Company. We have exhausted our means. The
savages, women and children, ask us in vain for Rosaries.
We have no more Catechisms of the diocese left to distribute
among them; no English Prayer Books for the Catholic
Irish; no controversial books to lend. Heaven appears
to be deaf to our prayers, supplications and most ardent
wishes. You can judge of our situation and how much we
are to be pitied. We are in the mean time surrounded by
sects who are using all their efforts to scatter every where
the poisonous seeds of error, and who try to paralyze the
little good we may effect.

The Methodists are, first, at Wallamette, which is about
eight miles from my establishment; second, near the Klatraps,
south of the mouth of the Columbia river; third,
at Nez Quali, or Puget-sound; fourth, at the Great Dalles,
south of Walla walla; and fifth, at the Wallamette Falls.[Pg 389][289]
The Presbyterian Missions are at Wallawalla, as you
approach Colville.[290] In the midst of so many adversaries
we try to keep our ground firmly; to increase our numbers,
232 and to visit various parts, particularly where the
danger is most pressing. We also endeavor to anticipate
the others, and to inculcate the Catholic principles in those
places where error has not as yet found a footing, or even to
arrest the progress of evil, to dry it up at its source. The
conflict has been violent, but the savages now begin to open
their eyes as to who are the real ministers of Jesus Christ.
Heaven declares itself in our favor. If we had a priest to
hold a permanent station amongst the savages, the country
would be ours in two years. The Methodist Missions are
failing rapidly; they are losing their credit and the little
influence they possessed. By the grace of God, our cause
has prevailed at Wallamette. This spring, Mr. Demers
withdrew from the Methodists a whole village of savages,
situate at the foot of the Wallamette Falls. Mr. Demers
also visited the Schinouks [Chinook], below the Columbia
river. They are well disposed towards Catholicity. I have
just arrived from Cascades, which is eighteen leagues from
Vancouver. The savages at this place had resisted all the
insinuations of a pretended Minister.[291] It was my first
mission, and only lasted ten days. They learned in that[Pg 390]
time the sign of the cross, the offering of their hearts to
God, the Lord's Prayer, the Angelical Salutation, the
Apostles' Creed, the ten Commandments, and those of the
Church. I intend to revisit them soon, near Vancouver,
and to baptize a considerable number. Rev. Mr. Demers
has been absent these two months, on a visit to the savages
at the Bay of Puget-sound, who have long since besought
him to come amongst them. I have not been able to visit
since the month of May, my catechumens at Flackimar, a
village whose people were converted last spring, and who
had turned a deaf ear to a Mr. Waller,[292] who is established
at Wallamette. Judge then, sir, how great are our labors,
and how much it would advance our 233 mutual interest,
were you to send hither one of your Rev. Fathers, with one
of the three lay brothers. In my opinion, it is on this spot
that we must seek to establish our holy religion. It is here
that we should have a college, convent, and schools. It is
here that one day a successor of the Apostles will come from
some part of the world to settle, and provide for the spiritual
necessities of this vast region, which, moreover, promises
such an abundant harvest.       Here is the field of battle,
where we must in the first place gain the victory. It is here
that we must establish a beautiful mission. From the lower
stations the Missionaries and Rev. Fathers could go forth
in all directions to supply the distant stations, and announce
the word of God to the infidels still plunged in darkness and
the shadows of death. If your plans should not permit
you to change the place of your establishment, at least take
into consideration the need in which we stand of a Rev.[Pg 391]
Father, and of a lay brother, to succor us in our necessities.
By the latest dates from the Sandwich Islands, I am informed
that the Rev. Mr. Chochure had arrived there, accompanied
by three priests, the Rev. Mr. Walsh making the fourth.[293]
A large Catholic Church it was hoped would have been
ready last autumn for the celebration of the Holy Mysteries.
The natives were embracing our everlasting faith in great
numbers, and the meeting houses were almost abandoned.

The Bishop of Juliopolis, stationed at Red River,[294]
writes to me that the savages dwelling near the base of the
eastern part of the Rocky Mountains have deputed to him a
half blood who resides amongst them, to obtain from his
Grace a priest to instruct them. Rev. Mr. Thibault is
destined for this mission.


I remain, Rev. Father, yours,
F. N. Blanchet.





LETTER XVI


University of St. Louis, 1st Nov. 1842.

Very Rev. Father:


In my last letter of August, I promised to write to you
from St. Louis, should I arrive safely in that city. Heaven[Pg 392]
has preserved me, and here I am about to fulfil my promise.
Leaving Rev. Father Point and the Flat Head camp on the
river Madison, I was accompanied by twelve of our Indians.
We travelled in three days, a distance of 150 miles, crossing
two chains of mountains,[295] in a section of country frequently
visited by the Black Feet warriors, without, however, meeting
with any of these scalping savages. At the mouth of
the Twenty-five Yard River, a branch of the Yellow Stone,
we found 250 huts, belonging to several nations, all friendly
to us       the Flat Heads, Kalispels, Pierced Noses, Kayuses,
and Snakes. I spent three days amongst them to exhort
them to perseverance, and to make some preparations for
my long journey. The day of my departure, ten neophytes
presented themselves at my lodge to serve as my escort, and
to introduce me to the Crow tribe. On the evening of the
second day we were in the midst of this large and interesting
tribe. The Crows had perceived us from a distance; as
we approached, some of them recognised me, and at the cry
of "the Blackgown! the Blackgown!" the Crows, young
and old, to the number of three thousand, came out of their
wigwams. On entering the village, a comical scene occurred,
of which they suddenly made me the principal personage.
All the chiefs, and 235 about fifty of their warriors, hastened
around me, and I was literally assailed by them. Holding
me by the gown, they drew me in every direction, whilst[Pg 393]
a robust savage of gigantic stature, seemed resolved to carry
me off by main force. All spoke at the same time, and appeared
to be quarrelling, whilst I, the sole object of all this
contention, could not conceive what they were about. I remained
passive, not knowing whether I should laugh or be
serious. The interpreter soon came to my relief, and said
that all this uproar was but an excess of politeness and kindness
towards me, as every one wished to have the honor of
lodging and entertaining the Blackgown. With his advice
I selected my host, upon which the others immediately loosed
their hold, and I followed the chief to his lodge, which was
the largest and best in the camp. The Crows did not tarry
long before they all gathered around me, and loaded me
with marks of kindness. The social calumet, emblem of
savage brotherhood and union, went round that evening so
frequently, that it was scarcely ever extinguished. It was
accompanied with all the antics for which the Crows are so
famous, when they offer the calumet to the Great Spirit, to
the four winds, to the sun, fire, earth and water. These
Indians are unquestionably the most anxious to learn; the
most inquisitive, ingenious, and polished of all the savage
tribes east of the mountains. They profess great friendship
and admiration for the whites. They asked me innumerable
questions; among others, they wished to know the
number of the whites. Count, I replied, the blades of
grass upon your immense plains, and you will know pretty
nearly the number of the whites. They all smiled, saying
that the thing was impossible, but they understood my
meaning. And when I explained to them the vast extent
of the "villages" inhabited by white men (viz. New York,
236 Philadelphia, London, Paris) the grand lodges (houses)
built as near each other as the fingers of my hand, and four
or five piled up, one above the other       (meaning the different
stories of our dwellings;) when I told them that some[Pg 394]
of these lodges (speaking of churches and towers) were as
high as mountains, and large enough to contain all the
Crows together; that in the grand lodge of the national
council (the Capitol at Washington) all the great chiefs of
the whole world could smoke the calumet at their ease;
that the roads in these great villages were always filled with
passengers, who came and went more thickly than the vast
herds of buffalos that sometimes cover their beautiful plains;
when I explained to them the extraordinary celerity of
those moving lodges (the cars on the rail road) that leave
far behind them the swiftest horse, and which are drawn
along by frightful machines, whose repeated groanings
re-echo far and wide, as they belch forth immense volumes
of fire and smoke; and next, those fire canoes, (steamboats)
which transport whole villages, with provisions, arms and
baggage, in a few days, from one country to another, crossing
large lakes, (the seas) ascending and descending the great
rivers and streams; when I told them that I had seen white
men mounting up into the air (in balloons) and flying with
as much agility as the warrior eagle of their mountains,
then their astonishment was at its height; and all placing
their hands upon their mouths, sent forth at the same time,
one general cry of wonder. "The Master of life is great,"
said the chief, "and the white men are His favorites." But
what appeared to interest them more than aught else, was
prayer (religion;) to this subject they listened with the
strictest, undivided attention. They told me that they had
already heard of it, and they knew that this prayer made men
good and wise on earth, and insured 237 their happiness
in the future life. They begged me to permit the whole
camp to assemble, that they might hear for themselves the
words of the Great Spirit, of whom they had been told such
wonders. Immediately three United States flags were erected
on the field, in the midst of the camp, and three thousand[Pg 395]
savages, including the sick, who were carried in skins, gathered
around me. I knelt beneath the banner of our country,
my ten Flat Head neophytes by my side, and surrounded
by this multitude, eager to hear the glad tidings of the gospel
of peace. We began by intoning two canticles, after which
I recited all the prayers, which we interpreted to them: then
again we sang canticles, and I finished by explaining to them
the Apostles' Creed and the ten Commandments. They all
appeared to be filled with joy, and declared it was the happiest
day of their lives. They begged me to have pity on them       to
remain among them and instruct them and their little
children in the knowledge, love and service of the Great
Spirit. I promised that a Blackgown should visit them, but
on condition that the chiefs would engage themselves to put
a stop to the thievish practices so common amongst them,
and to oppose vigorously the corrupt morals of their tribe.
Believing me to be endowed with supernatural powers, they
had entreated me from the very commencement of our conversation,
to free them from the sickness that then desolated
the camp, and to supply them with plenty. I repeated to
them on this occasion that the Great Spirit alone could remove
these evils       God, I said, listens to the supplications
of the good and pure of heart; of those who detest their sins,
and wish to devote themselves to His service       but He shuts
his ears to the prayers of those who violate His holy law.
In His anger, God had destroyed by fire, five infamous
"villages" (Sodom, Gomorrah, 238 etc.) in consequence of
their horrid abominations       that the Crows walked in the
ways of these wicked men, consequently they could not complain
if the Great Spirit seemed to punish them by sickness,
war and famine. They were themselves the authors of all
their calamities       and if they did not change their mode of
life very soon, they might expect to see their misfortunes
increase from day to day       while the most awful torments[Pg 396]
awaited them, and all wicked men after their death. I
assured them in fine that heaven would be the reward of
those who would repent of their evil deeds and practice the
religion of the Great Spirit.

The grand orator of the camp was the first to reply:
"Black Gown," said he, "I understand you. You have said
what is true. Your words have passed from my ears into
my heart       I wish all could comprehend them." Whereon,
addressing himself to the Crows, he repeated forcibly, "Yes,
Crows, the Black Gown has said what is true. We are dogs,
for we live like dogs. Let us change our lives and our
children will live." I then held long conferences with all
the chiefs assembled in council. I proposed to them the
example of the Flat Heads, and Pends-d'oreilles, whose
chiefs made it their duty to exhort their people to the practice
of virtue, and who knew how to punish as they deserved
all the prevarications against God's holy law. They promised
to follow my advice, and assured me that I would find
them in better dispositions on my return. I flatter myself
with the hope, that this visit, the good example of my neophytes,
but principally the prayers of the Flat Heads will
gradually produce a favourable change among the Crows.
A good point in their character, and one that inspires me
with almost the certainty of their amendment, is, that they
have hitherto resisted courageously all attempts 239 to
introduce spirituous liquors among them. "For what is
this fire-water good?" said the chief to a white man who
tried to bring it into their country, "it burns the throat and
stomach; it makes a man like a bear who has lost his senses.
He bites, he growls, he scratches and he howls, he falls down
as if he were dead. Your fire-water does nothing but harm       take
it to our enemies, and they will kill each other, and
their wives and children will be worthy of pity. As for us
we do not want it, we are fools enough without it." A[Pg 397]
very touching scene occurred during the council. Several
of the savages wished to examine my Missionary Cross; I
thence took occasion to explain to them the sufferings of
our Saviour, Jesus Christ, and the cause of His death on the
Cross       I then placed my Cross in the hands of the great
chief; he kissed it in the most respectful manner; raising
his eyes to heaven, and pressing the Cross with both his
hands to his heart, he exclaimed, "O Great Spirit, take pity
on me and be merciful to Thy poor children." And his
people followed his example. I was in the village of the
Crows when news was brought that two of their most distinguished
warriors had fallen victims to the rage and cruelty
of the Black Feet. The heralds or orators went round the
camp, proclaiming in a loud voice the circumstances of the
combat and the tragic end of the two brave men. A gloomy
silence prevailed every where, only interrupted by a band
of mourners, whose appearance alone was enough to make
the most insensible heart bleed, and rouse to vengeance
the entire nation. This band was composed of the mothers
of the two unfortunate warriors who had fallen, their wives
carrying their new born infants in their arms, their sisters,
and all their little children. The unhappy creatures had
their heads shaven and cut in every direction; they were
gashed with numerous 240 wounds, whence the blood constantly
trickled. In this pitiable state they rent the air with
their lamentations and cries, imploring the warriors of their
nation to have compassion on them       to have compassion
on their desolate children       to grant them one last favour,
the only cure for their affliction, and that was, to go at once
and inflict signal vengeance on the murderers. They led
by the bridle all the horses that belonged to the deceased.
A Crow chief mounting immediately the best of these steeds,
brandished his tomahawk in the air, proclaiming that he
was ready to avenge the deed. Several young men rallied[Pg 398]
about him. They sung together the war-song, and started
the same day, declaring that they would not return empty-handed
(viz: without scalps).

On these occasions the near relations of the one who has
fallen, distribute every thing that they possess, retaining
nothing but some old rags wherewith to clothe themselves.
The mourning ceases as soon as the deed is avenged. The
warriors cast at the feet of the widows and orphans the
trophies torn away from the enemies. Then passing from
extreme grief to exultation, they cast aside their tattered
garments, wash their bodies, besmear themselves with all
sorts of colours, deck themselves off in their best robes,
and with the scalps affixed to the end of poles, march in
triumph round the camp, shouting and dancing, accompanied
at the same time by the whole village.

On the 29th I bade adieu to my faithful companions, the
Flat Heads, and the Crows. Accompanied by Ignatius,
Gabriel, and by two brave Americans, who, although Protestants,
wished to serve as guides to a Catholic Missionary,
I once more plunged into the arid plains of the Yellow Stone.
Having already described this region, I have nothing new
to add concerning it. This desert is undoubtedly 241
dangerous, and has been the scene of more tragic deeds,
combats, stratagems, and savage cruelties, than any other
region. At each step, the Crow interpreter, Mr. V. C., who
had sojourned eleven years in the country, recounted different
transactions; pointing, meanwhile, to the spots where
they had occurred, which, in our situation, made our blood
run cold, and our hair stand erect. It is the battle ground
where the Crows, the Black Feet, Scioux, Sheyennes, Assiniboins,
Arikaras, and Minatares, fight out their interminable
quarrels, avenging and revenging, without respite, their
mutual wrongs. After six days' march, we found ourselves
upon the very spot where a combat had recently taken[Pg 399]
place. The bloody remains of ten Assiniboins, who had
been slain, were scattered here and there       almost all the
flesh eaten off by the wolves and carniverous birds. At the
sight of these mangled limbs       of the vultures that soared
above our heads, after having satiated themselves with the
unclean repast, and the region round me, which had so
lately resounded with the savage cries of more savage men,
engaged in mutual carnage       I own that the little courage
I thought I possessed, seemed to fail me entirely, and give
place to a secret terror, which I sought in vain to stifle or
conceal from my companions. We observed in several
places the fresh tracks of men and horses, leaving no doubt
in our minds as to the proximity of hostile parties; our
guide even assured me that he thought we were already discovered,
but by continuing our precautions he hoped we
might perhaps elude their craftiness and malicious designs,
for the savages very seldom make their attacks in open day.
The following is the description of our regular march until
the 10th of September. At day-break we saddled our horses
and pursued our journey; at 10 A. M. we breakfasted in a
suitable place, that would offer 242 some advantage in
case of an attack. After an hour and a half, or two hours'
rest, we resumed our march a second time, always trotting
our horses, until sunset, when we unsaddled them to dine
and sup; we then lighted a good fire, hastily raised a little
cabin of branches, to induce our ever watchful foes, in case
they pursue us, to suppose that we had encamped for the
night; for, as soon as the inimical videttes discover any thing
of the kind, they make it known by a signal to the whole
party. They then immediately assemble, and concert the
plan of attack. In the meantime, favored by the darkness,
we pursued our journey quietly until 10 or 12 o'clock at night,
and then, without fire or even shelter, each one disposed
himself as well as he might, for sleep. It appears to me[Pg 400]
that I hear you ask: But what did you eat for your breakfast
and supper? Examine the notes of my journal, and
you will acknowledge that our fare was such as would excite
the envy of the most fastidious gastronome. From the
25th of August to the 10th of September, 1842, we killed, to
supply our wants, as we journeyed on, three fine buffalo
cows, and two large bulls; (only to obtain the tongue and
marrow bones) two large deer, as fat as we could have
wished; three goats, two black-tail deer, a big-horn or mountain
sheep, two fine grey bears, and a swan       to say
nothing of the pheasants, fowls, snipes, ducks and geese.

In the midst of so much game, we scarcely felt the want
of bread, sugar or coffee. The haunches, tongues and ribs
replaced these. And the bed? It is soon arranged. We
were in a country where you lose no time in taking off your
shoes; your wrap your buffalo robe around you, the saddle
serves as a pillow, and thanks to the fatigues of a long journey
of about forty miles, under a burning sun, you have
scarcely laid your head upon it before you are asleep. 243
The gentlemen of Fort Union, at the mouth of the Yellow
Stone, received me with great politeness and kindness. I
rested there during three days. A journey so long and continuous,
through regions where the drought had been so
great that every sign of vegetation had disappeared, had
very much exhausted our poor horses. The 1800 miles
that we had yet to travel, were not to be undertaken lightly.
After having well considered every thing, I resolved to
leave my horses at the Fort, and to trust myself to the impetuous
waters of the Missouri in a skiff, accompanied by
Ignatius and Gabriel. The result was most fortunate, for,
on the third day of our descent, to our great surprise and
joy, we heard the puffing of a steamboat. It was a real
God-send to us; accordingly, our first thought was to thank
God, in all the sincerity of our hearts. We soon beheld[Pg 401]
her majestically ascending the stream. It was the first
boat that had ever attempted to ascend the river in that season
of the year, laden with merchandize for the Fur Trade
Company. Four gentlemen from New York, proprietors of
the boat, invited me to enter and remain on board.[296] I
accepted with unfeigned gratitude their kind offer of hospitality;
the more so, as they assured me that several parties
of warriors were lying in ambush along the river. On
entering the boat I was an object of great curiosity       my
blackgown, my missionary cross, my long hair, attracted
attention. I had thousands of questions to answer, and
many long stories to relate about my journey.

I have but a few words to add. The waters were low,
the sand-banks and snags everywhere numerous; the boat
consequently encountered many obstacles in her passage.
We were frequently in great danger of perishing. Her
keel was pierced by pointed rocks, her sides rent by the
snags. Twenty times the wheels had been broken to 244
pieces. The pilot's house had been carried away in the
tempest; the whole cabin would have followed if it had
not been made fast by a large cable. Our boat appeared
to be little more than a mere wreck, and in this wreck,
after forty-six days' navigation from the Yellow Stone, we
arrived safely at St. Louis.

On the last Sunday of October, at 12 o'clock, I was
kneeling at the foot of St. Mary's Altar, in the Cathedral,
offering up my thanksgiving to God for the signal protection
He had extended to his poor, unworthy servant. From
the beginning of April I had travelled five thousand miles.
I had descended and ascended the dangerous Columbia
river. I had seen five of my companions perish in one of
those life-destroying whirlpools, so justly dreaded by those
who navigate that stream. I had traversed the Wallamette,
crossed the Rocky Mountains, passed through the[Pg 402]
country of the Black Feet, the desert of the Yellow Stone,
and descended the Missouri; and in all these journeys I
had not received the slightest injury. "Dominus memor
fuit nostri et benedixit nobis." I recommend myself to
your good prayers, and have the honor to remain.


Your very humble and obedient
son in Jesus Christ,
P. J. De Smet, S.J.

   Indian Symbolical Catechism




[Pg 404][Pg 405]




EXPLANATION OF THE INDIAN
SYMBOLICAL CATECHISM


1. Four thousand years from the creation of the world
to the coming of the Messiah. 1843 years from the birth
of Jesus Christ to our times. (On the map, each blank
line represents a century.) Instruction.       There is but one
God; God is a spirit; He has no body; He is everywhere;
He hears, sees and understands every thing; He cannot be
seen, because he is a spirit. If we are good we shall see
Him after our death, but the wicked shall never behold
Him; He has had no beginning, and will never have an end;
He is eternal; He does not grow old; He loves the good,
whom he recompenses; He hates the wicked, whom he
punishes. There are three persons in God; each of the
three is God       they are equal in all things,      c.

seas, plants, and trees of the earth; fourth day, the sun,
246 moon, and stars; fifth day, the birds and fishes; sixth

and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The seventh
day was one of rest. A short time after the seventh day,
the serpent tempted Eve. The fall of Adam, original sin;
its consequences. Adam driven from Paradise, the joy of
the Devil. The promise given of a future Saviour, the Son[Pg 406]
of God. He did not come immediately, but 4000 years
afterwards.

N. B. It is not well to interrupt too frequently the explanation

fast of Moses. Second tables of the law, 40 years in the
desert, the manna, the water issuing from the rock, the
brazen serpent. Caleb and Josua. Moses prays with his
arms extended. Josua. The passage of the Jordan. Fall
of the walls of Jericho. The twelve Tribes. Government

FOOTNOTES:



[1] Volume xxvii of our series begins with chapter xxxiii of the original New
York edition (1838) of Flagg's The Far West. The author is here describing
the part of his journey made in the late summer or early autumn of 1836.       Ed.



[2] The Vermilion River (which Flagg incorrectly wrote Little Vermilion) rises,
with several branches, in the western and southern portions of La Salle County,
and flows north and west, entering Illinois River at Rock Island, in Livingston
County.


Steelesville (formerly Georgetown) is about fifteen miles east of Kaskaskia, on
the road between Pinkneyville and Chester; the site was settled on by George
Steele in 1810. A block-house fort erected there in 1812 protected the settlers
against attacks from the Kickapoo Indians. In 1825 a tread-mill was built,
and two years later a store and post-office were erected. The latter was named
Steele's Mills. The settlement was originally called Georgetown and later changed
by an act of state legislature to Steelesville, being surveyed in 1832.       Ed.



[3] Chester is on the Mississippi River, in Randolph County, just below the
mouth of Kaskaskia River. In the summer of 1829, Samuel Smith built the
first house there, and two years later he, together with Mather, Lamb and Company,
platted the town site. It was named by Jane Smith from her native town,
Chester, England, and was made the seat of justice for Randolph in 1848.       Ed.



[4] Flagg is probably referring to Colonel Pierre Menard. See our volume xxvi,
p. 165, note 116.       Ed.



[5] Philadelphia was founded in 1682. There has been much discussion about
the exact date of the founding of Kaskaskia. E. G. Mason was of the opinion
that this uncertainty had arisen in the confounding of Kaskaskia with an earlier
Indian settlement of the same name on the Illinois River. It seems probable
that Kaskaskia on the Mississippi was started in 1699. Consult E. G. Mason,
"Kaskaskia and its Parish Records," in Magazine of American History (New
York, 1881), vi, pp. 161-182, and Chapters from Illinois History (Chicago, 1901);
also C. W. Alvord, The Old Kaskaskia Records (Chicago Historical Society, 1906).
See also A. Michaux's Travels, in our volume iii, p. 69, note 132.       Ed.



[6] The church of the Immaculate Conception, the first permanent structure
of its kind west of the Alleghany Mountains, was built in 1720. It was torn down
in 1838 and a large brick church built. For a more detailed description of the
former, see post, pp. 62-64.       Ed.



[7] Hall.       Flagg.



[8] Jacques Marquette was a Jesuit missionary, not a Recollect. Consult R. G.
Thwaites, Father Marquette (New York, 1902). On Jolliet see Francis Parkman,
La Salle (Boston, 1869); and the latest authority, Ernest Gagnon, Louis Jolliet
(Quebec, 1902).       Ed.



[9] For a short note on the Illinois Indians, consult our volume xxvi, p. 123,
note 86.       Ed.



[10] Flagg errs in saying that Jolliet published an account of his adventures.
His journal was lost in the St. Lawrence River on the return journey. Father
Marquette, however, wrote a journal of his travels. See Thwaites, Jesuit Relations,
lix, which also contains Jolliet's map of North America (1674).       Ed.



[11] The Island of Anticosti, in the estuary of St. Lawrence River, contains about
3,900 square miles, and is not only of importance as a centre of hunting and fishing
interests, but is rich in undeveloped mineral resources. The population of a
few hundred souls is chiefly concerned in fishing. The island is now the property
of M. Henri Menier, a Parisian chocolate manufacturer, who personally rules
his seigniory with benevolent despotism.       Ed.



[12] Concerning La Salle's discoveries, see Ogden's Letters from the West, in our
volume xix, pp. 44-53, and accompanying notes.       Ed.



[13] Concerning Hennepin's expedition from Crêvec      ur to the Falls of St.
Anthony, Flagg is in error. Hennepin was accompanied by two Frenchmen,
Michel Accault and Antoine Auguel, and probably went merely as their spiritual companion. His publications were: Description de la Louisiane (Paris, 1683);
Nouvelle Découverte d'un tres grand Pays Situé dans l'Amérique (Utrecht, 1697);
Nouveau Voyage d'un Pais plus grand que l'Europe (Utrecht, 1698). The first
was dedicated to Louis XIV, the last two to William III, king of England. For
bibliography of Hennepin, see Victor Hugo Paltsits, "Bibliographical Data," in
Thwaites, Hennepin's New Discovery (Chicago, 1903), pp. xlv-lxiv.       Ed.



[14] M. Tonti, among other writers, speaking of the country, according to Mr.
Peck's translation, says:


"The soil is, generally speaking, so fertile, that it produces naturally, without
culture, those fruits that nature and art together have much ado to bring forth
in Europe. They have two crops every year without any great fatigue. The
vines bring extraordinary grapes, without the care of the husbandman, and the
fruit-trees need no gardeners to look after them. The air is everywhere temperate.
The country is watered with navigable rivers, and delicious brooks and rivulets.
It is stocked with all sorts of beasts, as bulls, orignacs, wolves, lions, wild asses,
stags, goats, sheep, foxes, hares, beavers, otters, dogs, and all sorts of fowl, which
afford a plentiful game for the inhabitants."


In another place, this writer gives an amusing account of hunting "wild bulls,"
which "go always by droves of three or four hundred each." This description
answers well for the buffalo, but it is not so easy to determine what animals they
mistook for "wild asses, goats, and sheep."


Passing down the Mississippi, Tonti mentions the same animals, and describes
the forest-trees with tolerable accuracy, had he not added, "one sees there whole plains covered with pomegranate-trees, orange-trees, and lemon-trees; and, in
one word, with all kinds of fruit-trees." Goats are frequently mentioned by different
writers. Hennepin, while narrating the account of an embassy from Fort
Frontenac to the Iroquois nation, and the reception the party met with, says:
"The younger savages washed our feet, and rubbed them with grease of deer,
wild goats, and oil of bears." When upset in their boat and cast on the western
shore of Lake Michigan, an Indian of their company "killed several stags and
wild goats."


Wild goats are named so frequently, and in so many connexions, as hardly to
admit of an intentional misrepresentation.       Flagg.


Comment by Ed. For sketches of Charlevoix and Tonty, see Nuttall's Journal,
in our volume xiii, pp. 116 and 117, notes 81 and 85 respectively.



[15] For a recent work on La Salle, consult P. Chesnel, Histoire de Cavelier de
La Salle (Paris, 1901). With the exception of Crêvec      ur, Prudhomme, and
St. Louis, we have no definite proof that La Salle established any other forts in
the Mississippi Valley. He erected a monument at the mouth of the Mississippi
on April 9, 1682, on taking possession of the country in the name of Louis XIV.
Kaskaskia and Cahokia were not founded by the associates of La Salle on the
latter's return. For historical sketches of these towns, see A. Michaux's Travels,
in our volume iii, p. 69, note 132, and p. 70, note 135, respectively. La Salle
was assassinated March 19, 1687, on a branch of the Trinity River, in the present
state of Texas.       Ed.



[16] Father Marquette died May 18, 1675, on the present site of Ludington,
Michigan.       Ed.



[17] For the settlement of Peoria, see our volume xxvi, p. 133, note 93.       Ed.



[18] Owing to the exhaustion of France following the War of the Spanish Succession,
Louis XIV, determined to develop the resources of the vast Louisiana
territory, granted (September 14, 1712) to Antoine Crozat, a wealthy merchant,
the exclusive right of trade in Louisiana for a term of fifteen years. Among other
privileges, Crozat was permitted to send one ship a year to Africa for a cargo of
negroes; to possess and operate all mines of precious metals in the territory, on
the condition that a fourth of the metal be turned over to the king; and to possess
in perpetuity all buildings and manufactories erected by him in the colony. On
the other hand, Crozat was obliged to import two shiploads of colonists each
year, and after nine years to assume all the expenses of the government. In the
meantime the king was to furnish fifty thousand livres annually. Crozat did all
in his power to develop the resources of the country; but owing to discord among
the subordinate officials, in despair he surrendered the charter to the prince regent
(August 13, 1717). See Charles Gayarré, History of Louisiana (New Orleans, 1903).
After Crozat's surrender, Louisiana territory was turned over to the Mississippi
(or Western) Company, directed by John Law; see post, p. 49, note 28. Philip
François Renault was made the principal agent for a French company, whose
purpose was the development of the mines of the territory. In 1719 he sailed
from France with more than two hundred mechanics, stopped at the West Indies,
and secured a cargo of five hundred negro slaves, and in due course arrived at
Fort Chartres in the Illinois (1721). Large grants of land for mining purposes
were made to Renault       an extensive tract west of the Mississippi River; another, fifteen leagues square, near the site of Peoria; and still another above Fort
Chartres, one league along the river and two leagues deep. He founded St.
Philippe, near the fort, and built what was probably the first smelting furnace in
the Mississippi Valley. In 1743 he returned to France, where he died.       Ed.



[19] Pierre Charles le Sueur went to Canada when a young man, and engaged
in the fur-trade. In 1693, while commandant at Chequamegon, he erected two
forts       one on Madelaine Island, in Chequamegon Bay (Lake Superior), and
another on an island in the Mississippi, near Red Wing, Minnesota. Later he
discovered lead mines along the upper Mississippi. In 1699 he returned from a
visit to France, and under Iberville's directions searched for copper mines in the
Sioux country, where Le Sueur had earlier found green earth. Le Sueur reached
the mouth of Missouri River (July 13, 1700) with nineteen men, according to
Bénard de la Harpe's manuscript, compiled from Le Sueur's Journal       with
twenty-nine men, as related by Pénicaut, a member of the expedition. The company
was later increased to perhaps thirty or forty, but not ninety, as Flagg says.
Le Sueur ascended the Mississippi, and its tributary the Minnesota, and erected
a fort in August, 1700, one league above the point where the Blue Earth River
(St. Peter's River, until 1852) empties into the Minnesota. This fort he named
l'Huillier, in honor of his patron in France. Flagg has confused this site with
that of Fort Armstrong at Rock Island, Illinois. In May, 1701, Le Sueur left the
fort in care of d'Eraque, who remained in charge until 1703, when he abandoned
the place. For extracts from original documents relating to Le Sueur's activities,
consult: "Le Sueur's Mines on the Mississippi," "Le Sueur's Voyage up the Mississippi,"
and "Le Sueur's Fort on the Mississippi," in Wisconsin Historical
Collections, xvi, pp. 173, 174, 177-200.       Ed.

[21] The battle of Mauilla, to which Flagg is referring, was fought in October,
1540, between De Soto's men and the Mobilian Indians, near the present site of
Mobile. Our author is mistaken in supposing that these Indians were the Kaskaskia.
De Soto reached the Mississippi in May, 1541, and died May 21, 1542.
He started on the expedition with less than seven hundred men, instead of one
thousand. According to Herrera, his body was laid in a hollow live-oak log, and
lowered into the Mississippi; but it seems more probable that the corpse was
wrapped in mantles made heavy by a ballast of sand, and thus lowered into the
water. See John G. Shea, "Ancient Florida," in Justin Winsor, Narrative and
Critical History of America (Boston and New York, 1886), ii, pp. 231-283; also

1904).       Ed.



[22] Annexed is a copy of the grant of the celebrated commons attached to the
village of Kaskaskia. It is the earliest title the citizens hold to seven thousand
acres of the most fertile land in the West       perhaps in the world.


"Pierre de Rigault de Vaudreuil, Governor and Edme Gatien Salmon
Commissary orderer of the Province of Louisiana, seen the petition to us presented
on the sixteenth day of June of this present year by the Inhabitants of the Parish
of the Immaculate Conception of Kaskaskia dependence of the Illinois, tending
to be confirmed in the possession of a common which they have had a long time
for the pasturage of their cattle in the Point called La point de bois, which runs to
the entrance of the River Kaskaskia. We, by virtue of the power to us granted
by his Majesty have confirmed and do confirm to the said Inhabitants the possession
of the said common on the following conditions       


"First, That the concessions heretofore granted either by the India Company
either by our predecessors or by us in the prairie of Kaskaskia on the side of the
point which runs to the entrance of the river, shall terminate at the land granted
to a man named Cavalier, and in consequence, that all concessions that may have
been made on the said point from the land of the said Cavalier forward, on the
side of the entrance of the said river shall be null and void and of no effect. In
consequence of which, the said Point, as it is above designated, shall remain in common without altering its nature, nevertheless, reserving to us the power
whenever the case may require it, of granting the said commons to the inhabitants

"Secondly, on the road vulgarly called the Square Line between the large and
small line shall be rendered practicable and maintained for the passage of the
Carts and Cattle going into the Common, and this by lack of the proprietors as
well of the great as of the small line whose lands border on the roads of the Square
line. And as to the places which ought to run along the side of the village from the
said road of the Square line unto the river, as also the one on the side of the point
running to the Mississippi and to the Kaskaskia river, they shall be made and
maintained at the expense of the community, to the end that the cultivated lands
be not injured by the cattle.


"Thirdly, To facilitate to the inhabitants the means of making their autumnal
harvest, and prevent its being damaged by the cattle, we forbid all persons to leave
their cattle range upon cultivated lands       they are, notwithstanding, permitted to
graze upon their own proper lands on having them diligently watched.


"Fourthly, Willing that the wood which is on the land granted belong to the proprietors
of the said lands, we forbid all persons to cut down any elsewhere than on their
own lands, and as to the wood which may be found in the commons to cut down for their
own use, either for building or for fire wood, and this shall be the present regulation.

for pasturage and fuel. By an act of the legislature passed in 1854, the
citizens were authorized to elect five trustees every two years, who should exercise
the charge of the commons, lease portions thereof, and apply the proceeds to church
and school purposes only. The common fields were also originally owned jointly
by the villagers, though each resident was assigned an individual portion. The
United States commissioners, in 1809, determined the rights of each citizen, and the

[37] During the Indian troubles a fort was erected in 1736 on an eminence, later
known as Garrison Hill, opposite Kaskaskia. It was repaired and occupied by
a French garrison at the opening of the French and Indian War. In 1766 the
fort was burned, but another soon afterward built, was occupied by the English
(1772) and named Fort Gage, in honor of the British commander-in-chief. On
the night of July 4, 1778, Colonel George Rogers Clark captured the fort and
made it his headquarters while in Illinois. It was abandoned at the close of the
Revolution, but was re-occupied for a short time by American troops in 1801.
Colonel Pike's regiment was stationed there for a short period. See R. G. Thwaites,

[38] The reader will recollect that these notes were sketched two years ago. Since
that time some changes in this old edifice have taken place; the whole southwest

High mass was in celebration at the time, and the church was crowded, but no
accident occurred. The old building has been since dismantled, however; its
bell removed from the tower, and the whole structure will soon, probably, be
prostrated by "decay's effacing finger."       Flagg.

[40] A convent of the Visitation was established at Kaskaskia in May, 1833, by
a colony from the parent house at Georgetown, District of Columbia. It was
patronized by Pierre Menard, and connected with the academy named in his
honor. A large building was erected and opened for pupils in 1836. The institution
enjoyed a high reputation until the flood of 1844 forced its abandonment.

[41] I give the tradition of the farmers now resident upon the spot. History
differs somewhat.


Most of the historical facts relative to the extermination of the Abnaquis
will be found condensed in the subjoined extract from a late valuable work.


"Determined on destroying this assemblage of Indians, which was the headquarters
of the whole eastern country at this time, the English, in 1724, sent out
a force, consisting of 208 men and three Mohawk Indians, under Captains Moulton,
Harman, and Bourne, to humble them. They came upon the village the 23d
August, when there was not a man in arms to oppose them. They had left 40
of their men at Teconet Falls, which is now within the town of Winslow, upon the
Kennebeck, and about two miles below Waterville College, upon the opposite side
of the river. The English had divided themselves into three squadrons: 80, under
Harman, proceeded by a circuitous route, thinking to surprise some in their cornfields,
while Moulton, with 80 more, proceeded directly for the village, which, being surrounded by trees, could not be seen until they were close upon it. All
were in their wigwams, and the English advanced slowly and in perfect silence.
When pretty near, an Indian came out of his wigwam, and, accidentally discovering
the English, ran in and seized his gun, and giving the warwhoop, in a few
minutes the warriors were all in arms, and advancing to meet them. Moulton
ordered his men not to fire until the Indians had made the first discharge. This
order was obeyed, and, as he expected, they overshot the English, who then fired
upon them in their turn, and did great execution. When the Indians had given
another volley, they fled with great precipitation to the river, whither the chief
of their women and children had also fled during the fight. Some of the English
pursued and killed many of them in the river, and others fell to pillaging and
burning the village. Mogg, their chief, disdained to fly with the rest, but kept
possession of a wigwam, from which he fired upon the pillagers. In one of his
discharges he killed a Mohawk, whose brother, observing it, rushed upon and
killed him; and thus ended the strife. There were about 60 warriors in the
place, about one half of whom were killed.


"The famous Rasle shut himself up in his house, from which he fired upon
the English; and, having wounded one, Lieutenant Jaques, of Newbury, burst
open the door, and shot him through the head, although Moulton had given orders
that none should kill him. He had an English boy with him, about 14 years old,
who had been taken some time before from the frontiers, and whom the English
reported Rasle was about to kill. Great brutality and ferocity are chargeable to
the English in this affair, according to their own account; such as killing women
and children, and scalping and mangling the body of Father Rasle.


"There was here a handsome church, with a bell, on which the English committed
a double sacrilege, first robbing it, then setting it on fire; herein surpassing
the act of the first English circumnavigator in his depredations upon the Spaniards
in South America; for he only took away the gold and silver vessels of a
church, and its crucifix, because it was of massy gold, set about with diamonds,
and that, too, upon the advice of his chaplain. 'This might pass,' says a reverend
author, 'for sea divinity, but justice is quite another thing.' Perhaps it will be
as well not to inquire here what kind of divinity would authorize the acts recorded
in these wars, or, indeed, any wars.


"Upon this memorable event in our early annals, Father Charlevoix should
be heard. There were not, says he, at the time the attack was made, above 50
warriors at Neridgewok; these seized their arms, and run in disorder, not to defend
the place against an enemy who was already in it, but to favour the flight of the
women, the old men, and the children, and to give them time to gain the side of
the river, which was not yet in possession of the English. Father Rasle, warned
by the clamours and tumult, and the danger in which he found his proselytes,
ran to present himself to the assailants, hoping to draw all their fury upon him,
that thereby he might prove the salvation of his flock. His hope was vain; for hardly had he discovered himself, when the English raised a great shout, which
was followed by a shower of shot, by which he fell dead near to the cross which he
had erected in the centre of the village: seven Indians who attended him, and
who endeavoured to shield him with their own bodies, fell dead at his side. Thus
died this charitable pastor, giving his life for his sheep, after 37 years of painful
labours.


"Although the English shot near 2000 muskets, they killed but 30 and
wounded 40. They spared not the church, which, after they had indignantly
profaned its sacred vases and the adorable body of Jesus Christ, they set on fire.
They then retired with precipitation, having been seized with a sudden panic.
The Indians returned immediately into the village; and their first care, while
the women sought plants and herbs proper to heal the wounded, was to shed
tears upon the body of their holy missionary. They found him pierced with a
thousand shot, his scalp taken off, his skull fractured with hatchets, his mouth
and eyes filled with dirt, the bones of his legs broken, and all his members
mutilated in a hundred different ways.


"Such is the account of the fall of Rasle, by a brother of the faith; a deplorable
picture, by whomsoever related! Of the truth of its main particulars there can
be no doubt, as will be seen by a comparison of the above translation with the
account preceding it. There were, besides Mogg, other chief Indians who fell
that day: 'Bomazeen, Mogg, Wissememet, Job, Carabesett, and Bomazeen's
son-in-law, all famous warriors.' The inhumanity of the English on this occasion,
especially to the women and children, cannot be excused. It greatly eclipses the
lustre of the victory." Drake's Book of the Indians, b. iii., c. 9.       Flagg.


Comment by Ed. Instead of the French and Indian War (1754-1763), Flagg
is doubtless referring to Queen Anne's War (1702-1713).

concerning this massacre and the causes leading to it may be found under

[52] Immediately after the erection of Fort Chartres (1720), a village sprang up
and the Jesuits established there the parish of Ste. Anne de Fort Chartres. The
earliest records of this parish now extant, bear the date 1721.       Ed.



[53] Philip Pittman, who visited Fort Chartres in 1766, says in his Present State
of the European Settlements on the Missisippi (London, 1770), p. 46, concerning
Fort Chartres: "In the year 1764 there were about forty families in the village
near the fort, and a parish church, served by a Franciscan friar, dedicated to St.
Anne. In the following year, when the English took possession of the country,
they abandoned their houses, except three or four poor families, and settled at the
villages on the west side of the Missisippi, chusing to continue under the French
government."


In a personal letter dated November 3, 1762, Louis XV deeded to Charles III of Spain all of the French territory in North America lying to the west of Mississippi
River; see Shepherd, "Cession of Louisiana to Spain," in Political Science
Quarterly, xix, pp. 439-458; also Thwaites, France in America (New York, 1905),
pp. 272-275. Napoleon coerced Charles IV to retrocede Louisiana to France,
by the secret treaty of St. Ildefonso, signed October 1, 1800. Three years later
(April 30, 1803), Napoleon sold Louisiana to the United States for $15,000,000.


Captain Louis St. Ange de Bellerive formally surrendered Fort Chartres to
Captain Sir Thomas Sterling on October 10 (not July), 1765, went to St. Louis,
and entering the Spanish service was placed in command of the little garrison
there, composed almost wholly of his French compatriots who had removed thither
from the Illinois. For a sketch of St. Ange, see Croghan's Journals, in our volume
i, p. 138, note 109.       Ed.



[54] Sir Thomas Sterling (1733-1808), commissioned captain of the 42nd Highlanders
(1757), served with his men in the conquest of Canada, and the capture
of Martinique (1759) and Havanna (1762). Having taken command of Fort
Chartres in October, 1765, he was relieved of this unpleasant duty, December 4
of the same year, by Major Robert Farmer, heading a detachment of British foot
from Mobile. Sterling and his regiment set sail from America (1767), but returned
(1776) and served with distinction at the storming of Fort Washington (1776) and
of Elizabethtown (1779). He was wounded at Springfield (Massachusetts) in
June, 1780. Promoted through the various ranks, he was made a royal aide-de-camp
of the king and in turn a colonel (February 19, 1779), major-general (November
20, 1782), and general (January 1, 1801). He became baronet of Andoch
on his brother's death, July 26, 1799. Several Illinois historians strangely persist
in killing Sterling in 1765, shortly after he took command at Fort Chartres.
See Dictionary of National Biography; and Documents relative to Colonial History
of New York, vii, p. 786.


Lieutenant-Colonel John Wilkins, appointed captain of the 55th foot (1755)
and then major (1762), commanded at Niagara. In 1763, while marching to
relieve Detroit, he was attacked by Indians and forced after heavy losses to retreat
to Fort Schlosser. Later, he made an unsuccessful attempt by water, but was
caught in a disastrous storm. In August, 1764, Wilkins was promoted to the
majorship of the 60th, and in the following January was appointed lieutenant-colonel
of the 18th Royal Irish with seven companies. In May, 1768, he was
ordered from Philadelphia to Fort Pitt, and thence to Fort Chartres. His administration
was unpopular, and grave charges       notably misappropriation of land and funds       were brought against him. He was suspended in 1771, set sail
for Europe the following year, and either died or left the army (1775). See
Historical Magazine, viii, p. 260; and Documents relative to Colonial History
of New York, viii, p. 185.       Ed.



[55] Subjoined is a copy of the preliminary proceedings of the first regular court
of justice held in Illinois while under the British government. It purports to be
transcribed from the state records, and first appeared in a Western newspaper.
It lays before the reader a view of the subject, which the most graphic description
would fail to present.


"At a Court held at Chartres Village, in the Illinois, this sixth day of November,
in the eighth year of the reign of our Sovereign Lord, George the Third,
by the grace of God, of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, King, Defender
of the Faith,      c.,      c.,      c., in the year of our Lord Christ one thousand seven
hundred and sixty-eight, 1768.


"Present, George Morgan, James Remsey, James Campbell, James M'Millar,
Jean Baptist Barbeau, and Peter Girardot, Esqrs., Justices. Commissions of the
peace granted by John Wilkins, Esqr., Governor and Commandant of the said
country, and directed to the gentlemen named, were produced and read.


"Whereupon the said Justices took the several oaths of allegiance to his
Majesty's person and government, and also the oaths of Justices of the peace;
which oaths were administered to them by the Governor and Commandant aforesaid.


"A commission from the said Governor to Dennis M'Croghan, Esq., to be
Sheriff of the country aforesaid, was produced by the said Dennis M'Croghan,
Esq., and read, who took and subscribed the usual oaths of allegiance to his
Majesty's person and government, and also the oath of sheriff for said country.


"The Governor and Commandant aforesaid entered into a recognizance in the
sum of five hundred pounds lawful money of Great Britain for the said Sheriff's due
performance of his office."


It would appear from the following deed, made by a military sergeant, executing
the office of sheriff under the style of Provost under Commandant Hugh Lord, in
1772, that the government in Illinois was then purely military.


"Be it remembered that on this nineteenth day of December, in the year of
our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-two, by virtue of a writ
unto me directed, I, Andrew Hoy, Provost, did seize, levy, and distrain upon the
dwelling-house and lot of John Baptist Hubardeau, situated in the village of
Kaskaskia, for a debt due as per note of hand, of the signature of the aforesaid
Hubardeau, for the sum of two thousand and forty livres, with interest and
damages. Now, know ye, that the aforesaid writ of Fieri Facias was issued by Hugh Lord, Esq., Captain in his Majesty's 18th or Royal Regiment of Ireland,
in manner and form following:




"George the Third, by the grace of God, of Great Britain, France, and Ireland,
King, Defender of the Faith,      c.


"To Sergeant Hoy, Provost.


"We command you that you cause to be made of the (goods) and chattels of
John Baptist Hubardeau, in your bailiwick, two thousand and forty livres, which
Franks       Company, lately, in our court, before us, at Kaskaskia, recovered against
him by virtue of a power of attorney, for a debt, with lawful interest, and damages
which they have sustained, occasioned as well by the detaining of the said debt, as for
their expenses and costs by them laid out in and about their suit in that behalf,
whereof the said Hubardeau is convicted, and have you the money before us at
Kaskaskia as soon as the sale of said effects shall admit, to render to the said
Franks       Company their debt and damages aforesaid, and have then there this
writ.

"Moreover, that in consequence of further orders from the commandant aforesaid,
I did give general notice of the sale thereof by the following advertisement,
which was publicly placed for perusal and knowledge of the inhabitants in general,
both here and at the village of Caho.[56]

"At the expiration of which time, the aforesaid house was, agreeable to law,
justice, and equity, exposed to sale, first at the church gate, and afterwards at
different parts of the village, to prevent as much as possible, any persons pleading
ignorance of the sale thereof. Now, know ye, in discharge of the duty of my

Owing to the encroachments by the Mississippi, Fort Chartres was abandoned in 1772, and was never again used as a garrison. The legend given by Flagg is
somewhat exaggerated. The French settlements adjacent to Kaskaskia readily
accepted the situation on being invited by Clark's representatives, who were
accompanied by Kaskaskians as friendly interpreters.

St. Philippe, five miles from Fort Chartres on the road to Cahokia, was founded about 1725 by Renault, on a tract granted to him in 1723. Philip Pittman, who
visited the place in 1766, wrote that there were about sixteen houses and a small
church left standing, although all the inhabitants save the captain of the militia
had crossed the Mississippi the preceding year. In 1803, John Everett was the
sole inhabitant.       Ed.

[65] Milk-sickness, no longer so diagnosed by medical authorities, is described
by early writers in the Middle West as a malignant disease attacking both men
and stock. It was supposed that the disease was contracted by eating the
flesh or dairy products of animals that had grazed on a certain weed. In the
case of the human being the symptoms were intolerable thirst, absolute constipation,
low temperature, an extreme nervous agitation, but with an absence of
chills and headaches. Recovery seemed to be the exception. Although no specific remedy was used, the best results were thought to be obtained by judicious
stimulation and careful nursing. The same disease among stock was usually known
as "trembles." The symptoms were the same as with men, and death followed,
generally within eight or ten days. A farm where this dreaded disease had come
was called a "milk-sick farm," and was rendered almost unsalable. For a later
and more detailed account, see Thomas L. M'Kenney, Memoirs, official and personal,
with Sketches of Travels among the Northern and Southern Indians, etc.
(New York, 1846), p. 141. Dr. William M. Beach, a pioneer physician in Ohio,
who had had much experience with milk sickness, wrote an article for Albert
H. Buck, Reference Handbook of Medical Science (New York, 1884-87), volume v.
An abstract of the above article by Beach is given in the edition for 1902.       Ed.

[68] Mr. Flint's remarks respecting the Ancient Pottery found in the West coincides
so well with the result of my own more limited observation, that I subjoin
them in preference to extended description myself. Preceding these remarks is an interesting notice of the Lilliputian graves on the Merrimac, to which allusion
has several times been made.


"At the time the Lilliputian graves were found on the Merrimac, in the county
of St. Louis, many people went from that town to satisfy their curiosity by inspecting
them. It appears from Mr. Peck that the graves were numerous; that the
coffins were of stone; that the bones in some instances were nearly entire; that
the length of the bodies was determined by that of the coffins which they filled,
and that the bodies in general could not have been more than from three feet
and a half to four feet in length. Thus it should seem that the generations of the
past in this region were mammoths and pigmies.


"I have examined the pottery, of which I have spoken above, with some attention.
It is unbaked, and the glazing very incomplete, since oil will soak through
it. It is evident, from slight departure from regularity in the surface, that it was
moulded by the hand and not by anything like our lathe. The composition, when
fractured, shows many white floccules in the clay that resemble fine snow, and
this I judge to be pulverized shells. The basis of the composition appears to be
the alluvial clay carried along in the waters of the Mississippi, and called by the
French 'terre grasse,' from its greasy feel. Samples of this pottery, more or less
perfect, are shown everywhere on the river. Some of the most perfect have been
dug from what are called the 'chalk-banks,' below the mouth of the Ohio. The
most perfect that I have seen, being, in fact, as entire as when first formed, was a
vessel in my possession. It was a drinking jug, like the 'scyphus' of the ancients.
It was dug from the chalk-bank. It was smooth, well-moulded, and of the colour
of common gray stoneware. It had been rounded with great care, and yet, from
slight indentations on the surface, it was manifest that it had been so wrought
in the palm of the hand. The model of the form was a simple and obvious one       the
bottle-gourd       and it would contain about two quarts. This vessel had been
used to hold animal oil; for it had soaked through, and varnished the external
surface. Its neck was that of a squaw, known by the clubbing of the hair, after
the Indian fashion. The moulder was not an accurate copyist, and had learned
neither statuary nor anatomy; for, although the finish was fine, the head was
monstrous. There seemed to have been an intention of wit in the outlet. It was
the horrible and distorted mouth of a savage, and in drinking you would be obliged
to place your lips in contact with those of madam the squaw."       Flint's Recollections,
p. 173-4.       Flagg.

[69] Waterloo, in Monroe County, about thirty miles northwest of Kaskaskia,
was incorporated in 1848. In 1818 George Forquer purchased the land on which
the village now stands, and in the same year he and Daniel P. Cook (later a member
of Congress) laid out and named the town. In 1825 the county seat was
changed from Harrisonville to Waterloo. About 1830, John Coleman erected
a large wind-mill, later changed to an ox-mill (1837).


Bellefontaine is the name applied by the early French to a large spring a mile south of the present site of Waterloo. In 1782 Captain James Moore, who had
served under George Rogers Clark, settled at this spring, and in accordance with
orders from the Virginia government built a blockhouse fort as a protection against
the Indians. Owing to his tact and good judgment, amicable relations with the
Indians were maintained until 1786, when serious trouble really began. During
the next decade the Indians killed several whites.       Ed.



[70] Columbia, eight miles north of Waterloo, and fifteen miles south of St. Louis,
was laid out in 1820 on land belonging to Louis Nolan.       Ed.

[73] The passage subjoined relative to the Geological Transformations which
have taken place in the Mississippi Valley, is extracted from "Schoolcraft's
Travels in its central portions," and will be found abundantly to corroborate my
own observations upon the subject.


"It seems manifest, from various appearances, that the country we have under
consideration has been subjected to the influence of water at a comparatively
recent period; and it is evident that its peculiar alluvial aspect is the distinct and
natural result of the time and the mode in which these waters were exhausted. One
striking fact, which appears to have escaped general observation, is, that at some
former period there has been an obstruction in the channel of the Mississippi
at or near Grand Tower, producing a stagnation of the current at an elevation of
about one hundred and thirty feet above the present ordinary water-mark. This
appears evident from the general elevation and direction of the hills, which, for
several hundred miles above, are separated by a valley from twenty to twenty-five
miles wide, which now deeply imbosoms the current of the Mississippi. Wherever
these hills disclose rocky and precipitous fronts, a series of distinctly-marked
antique water-lines are to be observed. These water-lines preserve a parallelism which is very remarkable, and, what we should expect to find, constantly present
their greatest depression towards the sources of the river. At Grand Tower they
are elevated about one hundred and thirty feet above the summit level, at which
elevation we observe petrifactions of madrepores and various other fossil organic
remains which belong to this peculiar era. Here the rocks of dark-coloured limestone,
which pervade the country to so great an extent, project towards each other
as if they had once united; but, by some convulsion of nature, or, what is still
more probable, by the continued action of the water upon a secondary rock, the
Mississippi has effected a passage through this barrier, and thus producing an
exhaustion of the stagnant waters from the level prairie lands above."       Schoolcraft's
Travels, p. 218, 219.       Flagg.


Comment by Ed. This hypothesis, in the main formulated by H. R. Schoolcraft,
is still in its general features accepted by many geologists. See also Elisée
Reclus, The Earth and its Inhabitants (New York, 1893), article "North America,"
iii, pp. 224, 225.



[74] A similar spring is said to issue from debris at the foot of the cliffs on the
Ohio, in the vicinity of Battery Rock. Its stream is copious, clear, and cold,
ebbing and flowing regularly once in six hours. This phenomenon is explained
on the principle of the syphon. Similar springs are found among the Alps.       Flagg.



[75] Flagg is somewhat mistaken concerning the age of the block-house settlement.
Previous to 1800, the only American settlement in St. Clair County was
Turkey Hill, which at that date numbered twenty souls. William Scott, the first
settler, moved thither with his family from Kentucky in 1797, and became a permanent
resident. About 1810, Nathaniel Hill, Joshua Perkins, Reuben Stubblefield,
James and Reuben Lively, and Richard Bearley settled in the southeastern
corner of St. Clair County, and for protection against the Indians built a block-house
near the present city of Hillstown on Dosa Creek (a tributary of the Kaskaskia).
The fort was later abandoned, and the settlers moved to other parts
of the state. For a description of the fort, see History of St. Clair County, Illinois
(Philadelphia, 1881), pp. 261, 262.       Ed.



[76] William Buckland (1784-1856), a distinguished English geologist, who was
as well canon of Christ College, Oxford (1825), and dean of Westminster Abbey
(1845), contributed many valuable papers to geological publications. The Royal
Society's Catalogue of Scientific Papers shows that Buckland was the author of
fifty-three memoirs. His most important publication, Geology and Mineralogy
Considered with Reference to Natural Theology (a Bridgewater thesis, 1836),
attempts to prove by aid of science, "the Power, Wisdom, and Goodness of
God, as manifested in the Creation."       Ed.



[77] George Leopold Crétien Frédéric Dagobert, baron de Cuvier (1769-1832),
a French naturalist, was founder of the science of comparative anatomy. He
was chosen as one of the original members of the Institute, organized in 1795.
After holding various administrative offices under Napoleon, he was appointed
(1814) a councilor of state, which position he held under Louis XVIII. In 1819
he was made president of the committee of the interior, and chancellor of the
University of Paris. Louis Phillipe made him a peer of France. Cuvier's scientific
work falls into three divisions       paleontology, systematic zoology, and comparative
anatomy. He wrote extensively in all these fields, and in each achieved
high recognition. Consult: Sarah Lee, Memoirs of Baron Cuvier (London, 1833),
and Ducrotay de Blainville, Cuvier et Geoffrey Saint Hilaire (Paris, 1890).       Ed.



[78] Prairie du Pont (Prairie Bridge), located upon a creek of the same name,
was so christened for a log bridge which in early times crossed the creek at this
point. The settlement was first made about 1760 by people from Cahokia who,
according to tradition, fled thither from the floods; the site is ten or twelve feet
higher than that of Cahokia. The Sulpician missionaries had built a mill there
in 1754. In 1844 the place was nearly destroyed by floods.       Ed.



[79] For a short historical sketch of Cahokia, see A. Michaux's Travels, in our
volume iii, p. 70, note 135. Flagg, in common with the earlier writers, places the
date of Cahokia too early.       Ed.



[80] By act of Congress approved March 1, 1791, "a tract of land including the
villages of Cohos [Cahokia], and Prairie du Pont, and heretofore used by the
inhabitants of the said village as a common," was, "appropriated to the use of
the inhabitants ... to be used by them as a common, until otherwise disposed
of by law." By the same act, four hundred acres were ordered to be laid out, and "given to each of those persons who in the year one thousand seven hundred
and eighty-three were heads of families at Vincennes, or in the Illinois country,
on the Mississippi, and who, since that time, have moved from one of the said
places to the other."       Ed.



[81] In 1815 Etienne Pinçoneau (now spelled Pensoneau) laid out a town on the
present site of East St. Louis, and named it Jacksonville. His efforts proving
unsuccessful, he sold the land to McKnight and Brady, who in May, 1818, platted
the site and named it Illinoistown. During the succeeding autumn, the citizens
of Cahokia appointed five agents to lay out a town site on the Cahokia commons.
Illinois City thus came into existence, and the action of the citizens was legalized
by Congress (May 1, 1820). Illinoistown, Illinois City, and other small villages
were later united to form East St. Louis, which was incorporated in 1861 and
chartered four years later.       Ed.



[82] Father de Smet was sent on the mission to the Flathead Indians by Joseph
Rosati. For an account of the latter, see Flagg's Far West, in our volume xxvi,
p. 164, note 115.       Ed.



[83] In 1821, Pierre Chouteau, Jr., of the American Fur Company, established
a general agency in the bottom opposite Randolph Bluffs, about three miles below
the present site of Kansas City. His buildings having been destroyed by a flood
in 1826, he erected others on higher ground, in the present Guinott addition,
near the foot of Walnut street. The place was called Chouteau's Warehouse,
and soon became a favorite shipping point for the Indian trade. In 1831 John
McCoy built a trading house at the crossing of the roads from Chouteau's Warehouse
and Independence. Two years later he platted a town at this point and
named it Westport. Westport first used Chouteau's Warehouse as a landing
place, but later built a wharf on the high rocky bank of the river, at the present
foot of Grand Avenue, Walnut, Main, and Delaware streets. Because of superior
natural advantages, this latter place soon became the principal landing, and
in 1838 a company purchased the site, platted a town, and named it Kansas City.
Westport thus became the starting point for the caravans to the Western country.


Prior to 1822, the overland expeditions seem to have been composed of men
on foot carrying their wares in packs. Later, pack horses were substituted, and
by 1830 wagons were used almost exclusively. Owing to the dangers from hostile
Indians, the traders going to Santa Fé or points in the Rocky Mountains formed
themselves into caravans for mutual protection, with an organized system of
guards and camps. See Gregg's Commerce of the Prairies, in our volume xix,
pp. 198-201, for a description of these caravans.       Ed.



[84] Andrew Drips was born in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania (1789),
went west, and with eight other St. Louis men formed the Missouri Fur Company
(1820). He was later a member of the independent firm of Fontenelle and Drips.
When the American Fur Company began their westward expansion, Drips entered
into their employ, having charge after 1836 of annual expeditions to the mountains.
In 1842, the company having encountered strong opposition, the federal government
was prevailed upon to revive the office of Indian agent. Drips served four
years as agent to the Sioux of the upper Missouri, with an annual salary of $1500.
In this capacity, Drips rendered valuable service to the company. Upon the
expiration of his term of office, he re-entered the company's employment, in which
he continued until his death at Kansas City, Missouri (1860). He married a
woman of the Oto Indian nation. Their daughter, Mrs. William Mulkey of
Kansas City, has in her possession many of her father's valuable papers. See
H. M. Chittenden, American Fur-Trade of the Far West (New York, 1902).       Ed.

[86] The rendezvous in 1840 was held in the upper valley of Green River, near
Fort Bonneville, in western Wyoming. Near the headwaters of the Missouri,
Columbia, and Colorado rivers, this place was a natural and well-known meeting
point. For a description of Green River, see Wyeth's Oregon, in our volume xxi,
p. 60, note 38; for the rendezvous at this place in 1834, see Townsend's Narrative,
in the same volume, p. 192, note 40.       Ed.

[88] In the Voyages aux Montagnes Rocheuses, De Smet says, "on the 4th of
July, I resumed my travels, with my Flatheads."       Ed.



[89] Flathead was a term applied to various tribes of Indians who were supposed
to practice the custom of flattening the heads of their infants. A division of the
Choctaw was known by this name. The tribe here referred to belonged to the
Salishan stock; see Franchère's Narrative, in our volume vi, p. 340, note 145.
They were not in the habit of flattening the head, and the origin of their cognomen
is unknown. The specific tribe visited by De Smet dwelt along the lake and
river which bear their name, with their chief centre in the Bitterroot Valley. By
the treaty of 1855 they ceded to the government an extensive tract of land in this
region, being nearly two degrees in width and extending from near the forty-second
parallel to the British line. In November, 1871, the president issued an
order for their removal from Bitterroot Valley to the Jocko reservation. Arrangements
were further completed by the article of agreement of August 27, 1872.
After considerable delay they removed thither, and together with the Pend
d'Oreille and Kutenai, kindred tribes, still inhabit the reservation. See Peter
Ronan, Historical Sketch of the Flathead Indian Nation (Helena, 1890).


The Pend d'Oreille (Ear-ring) Indians, whose native name was Kalispel,
were kindred to the Flathead, speaking a similar dialect. Their habitat lay northwest
of the Flathead proper, upon the Idaho lake and its tributary river bearing
their name.       Ed.



[90] The Bishop.       De Smet.



[91] Evidently a misprint for 27th of August. Consult the succeeding letter.       Ed.



[92] For sketches of the Blackfeet and the Crows, see Bradbury's Travels, in our
volume v, pp. 225 and 226, notes 120, 121 respectively. In Voyages aux Montagnes
Rocheuses, De Smet says that this camp of Crows consisted of one thousand
souls.


The Big Horn River, so called from the Rocky Mountain sheep, rises in the Wind River range, near the centre of Wyoming, flows north through the Big Horn
Mountains into Montana, and bending toward the northeast joins the Yellowstone
as its principal tributary. South of the Big Horn Mountains, the stream is
usually called Wind River. The Big Horn Valley, the home of the Crows, was
a rich fur-bearing region and frequently visited by trappers and traders.       Ed.



[93] The post visited by Father de Smet was Fort Van Buren, located on the
south bank of the Yellowstone, at the mouth of the Rosebud. It was built in
1835 by A. J. Tulloch for the American Fur Company, and stood until 1842,
when it was burned by instructions from Charles J. Larpenteur, who at once
ordered the erection of Fort Alexander, on the north side of the Yellowstone,
twenty miles higher up. De Smet was mistaken when he said that Fort Van Buren
was the first fort of the Yellowstone erected by the American Fur Company. Fort
Cass was built by A. J. Tulloch in 1832 at the mouth of the Big Horn, but three
years later was abandoned. The fourth and last fort erected in this region by
the American Fur Company was Fort Sarpy, on the south side of this river, twenty-five
miles below the old site of Fort Cass. Consult Major Frederick T. Wilson,
"Old Fort Pierre and its Neighbors," with editorial notes by Charles E. De Land,
in South Dakota Hist. Colls. (Aberdeen, S. D., 1902), i, pp. 259-379.       Ed.



[94] Ensyla (Insula), sometimes called Little Chief because of his station, also
named Red Feather from his official emblem, and christened Michael because of
his faithfulness, was one of the most influential of the Flathead chiefs, and figures
prominently in De Smet's work among the Indians of his tribe. In 1835 he had
visited the rendezvous in Green River Valley, in the hope of securing missionary
aid, and there met Samuel Parker and Marcus Whitman. See Samuel Parker,
Journal of an Exploring Tour among the Rocky Mountains (Ithaca, 1838), p. 77.
According to L. B. Palladino, Indian and White in the Northwest (Baltimore,
1894), Insula was disappointed not to find a "black robe," and preserved his
tribe for Catholic missionaries. His integrity, judgment, and bravery made him
highly esteemed.       Ed.

volume xxiii, p. 234, note 192. The smallpox scourge occurred in 1837.


In reference to buffalo-boats or skin-boats, see Maximilian's Travels, in our
volume xxiii, p. 279, note 246.       Ed.



[100] For the original location of the Arikara villages, see our volume xxii, pp. 335,
336, notes 299, 300. At the time of the great small-pox scourge (1837), the Arikara
were encamped near the Mandan village. The latter tribe abandoned their villages,
and the small remnant moved some three miles up the Missouri, where they
erected fifteen or twenty new huts; while the Arikara took possession of their
old villages, where De Smet found them. For their location see our volume xxiii,
pp. 254, 255. When the missionary in the succeeding sentence speaks of
starting from the "Mandan village," he means the former Mandan village, now
inhabited by the Arikara. The latter tribe remained at this site until their removal
to Fort Berthold, about 1862.       Ed.



[101] In reference to Fort Pierre, see Maximilian's Travels, in our volume xxii,
p. 315, note 277. For a description of the Little Missouri River, more frequently
known as Teton or Bad, see our volume xxiii, p. 94, note 81.       Ed.



[102] The reference is to the various divisions of the Dakota or Sioux; but the
classification is unsatisfactory. For recent classification, see J. W. Powell, U. S.
Bureau of Ethnology Report, 1885-86, pp. 111-113; also Maximilian's Travels, in our volume xxii, p. 326, note 287. By the "Jantonnais" and "Jantons," De
Smet intends the modern Yanktonai and Yankton.       Ed.



[103] Vermillion Post, established for trading with the lower Sioux tribes, was
located on the east bank of the Missouri, ten miles below the mouth of the Vermillion.
The shifting of the stream has since 1881 rendered difficult the locating
of the old post, which was described by Audubon, who passed there in 1843; see
M. R. Audubon, Audubon and his Journals (New York, 1897), i, pp. 493, 494.
Also consult South Dakota Historical Collections, i, pp. 376, 377. Dickson's post,
also called Fort Vermillion, was some miles above the river of that name. See
our volume xxiv, p. 97, note 73. It is uncertain which post is intended.       Ed.



[104] By the treaty made at Chicago in September, 1833, the Potawatomi, Ottawa,
and Chippewa ceded to the United States government about five million acres
of land, whereupon the Potawatomi were assigned to a reservation between the
western borders of the state of Missouri and the Missouri River, in what was
later known as the Platte purchase. This tract was incorporated with Missouri
in 1836, and the Indian tribe was transferred to a reservation in southwestern
Iowa, with Council Bluffs as their chief village. Here in 1838 Father Verreydt,
with Father de Smet and two lay brothers, laid the foundation of a mission dedicated
to the "Blessed Virgin and St. Joseph," where De Smet served until his
departure for the Flathead country (1840). Father Christian Hoecken succeeded
him. By the treaty of 1846 the Potawatomi were transferred from Iowa to Kansas,
where another Catholic mission was begun among them, frequently visited
by De Smet in his later life.       Ed.



[105] In 1839 Father de Smet undertook a journey from St. Joseph's mission, at
Council Bluffs, into the Sioux territory for the purpose of effecting a treaty between
these tribes and the Potawatomi. He ascended the Missouri in the steamer
of the American Fur Company, on which J. N. Nicollet, the famous geographer,
was likewise a passenger. See Chittenden and Richardson, De Smet, i, pp. 179-192.       Ed.



[106] Jean Philip von Roothan, born in Amsterdam (1785) of Catholic parents,
entered a Jesuit novitiate in Russia (1804) and was educated at the college of
Polotsk. He conducted a mission in Switzerland, and was the first superior of
the province of Turin, when in 1829 he was elected twenty-first general of the
order of Jesuits, an office in which he continued until his death in 1853. He was
much interested in the over-seas missions, in 1833 issuing an encyclical on their
behalf.       Ed.



[107] The reader will note that this letter concerns itself with the same journey
as that described in the previous epistle       the first visit to the Flatheads and
return (1840). De Smet wrote several descriptions of this journey; that contained
in his Voyages aux Montagnes Rocheuses is more detailed than either presented
herein. A translation of the latter is given in Chittenden and Richardson, who
do not reprint this letter to Roothan.       Ed.



[108] For a brief description of Nebraska or Platte (flat or shallow) River, see our
volume xiv, p. 219, note 170. It is the common belief that Nebraska is the aboriginal
term for Platte, signifying "Shallow." De Smet's alternative, "Bighorn,"
is not found elsewhere. See also Nebraska Historical Society Transactions,
i, p. 73       Ed.



[109] For the route of the first portion of the Oregon trail, over which De Smet
went out, see Wyeth's Oregon, in our volume xxi, p. 49, note 30. There were
several fording places for the South Platte, depending upon the state of the river.
In subsequent pages, De Smet gives a vivid description of the difficulties and
dangers of crossing this stream. See also Frémont's account in Senate Docs., 28
Cong., 2 sess., ii.       Ed.



[110] See Washington Irving, Astoria (Philadelphia, 1841), chapter xxii.       Ed.



[111] Laramie River, one of the principal tributaries of the North Platte, rises in
northern Colorado, flows north through Alba County, Wyoming, and breaking
through the Laramie Mountains turns northeast into the Platte. The name is
derived from a French Canadian trapper, Jacques Laramie, who about 1820
was killed upon its upper waters, by the Arapaho.       Ed.



[112] This information as to the origin of the Cheyenne is derived from Lewis's
Statistical View (London, 1807). See Original Journals of the Lewis and Clark
Expedition, vi, p. 100. It is now conceded that the Cheyenne, with their
kindred tribe the Arapaho, probably once dwelt about the waters of the
St. Croix River, in Wisconsin. Their tribal name (according to Lewis) was
Sharha (Shaway), possibly a variant of the Sioux form Shaiela or Shaiena,
whence their present name. Apparently they were driven northwestward from
their Wisconsin habitat, and first settled upon Cheyenne River, North Dakota       a
tributary of Red River of the North. It is conjectured that they were forced
southwest by the Sioux. The Warreconne, where they made their final stand,
is the present Big Beaver, in Emmons County, North Dakota. According to
Cheyenne tradition, they were formerly an agricultural people, forced into nomadic
habits by these various removals.

[116] The Ute belong, as De Smet says, to the Shoshonean stock, and originally
occupied the country directly south of the habitat of the Snake Indians, or Shoshoni
proper, which extended from the Rocky Mountains to California. The Ute
were divided into numerous bands, differently classified by various authorities,
and when first known to the whites numbered about four thousand souls. There
are now over two thousand on two reservations       the Southern Ute in southwestern
Colorado, and the other bands on the Unita reservation, in northeastern
Utah.       Ed.



[117] Although this mode of funeral exists amongst the Snakes, it is not, however,
common to all the Indian tribes. Amongst the people who live on the borders
of lake Abbitibbi, in Lower Canada, as soon as a warrior happens to die, they
wrap the body in a shroud, lower it into a grave about a foot and a half deep,
and place alongside it a pot, a knife, a gun, and such other articles as are of prime necessity to the savages. Some days after the burial, the relations of the deceased
assemble to smoke over his grave. They then hang presents upon the nearest
tree, particularly tobacco for the soul of the deceased, which is to come occasionally
and smoke upon the grave, where the body is laid. They suppose that the poor
soul is wandering not far from thence, until the body becomes putrified; after
which it flies up to heaven. The body of a wicked man, they say, takes a longer
time to corrupt than that of a good man; which prolongs his punishment. Such,
in their opinion, is the only punishment of a bad life.


In Columbia we find that a different custom prevails. There, so soon as the
person expires, his eyes are bound with a necklace of glass beads; his nostrils
filled with aiqua (a shell used by the Indians in place of money), and he is clothed
in his best suit and wrapped in a winding-sheet. Four posts, fixed in the ground,
and joined by cross beams, support the ærial tomb of the savage: the tomb itself
is a canoe, placed at a certain height from the ground, upon the beams I have
just mentioned. The body is deposited therein, with the face downwards, and
the head turned in the same direction as the course of the river. Some mats thrown
upon the canoe finish the ceremony. Offerings, of which the value varies with the
rank of the deceased, are next presented to him; and his gun, powder-horn and
shot-bag are placed at his sides.


Articles of less value, such as a wooden bowl, a large pot, a hatchet, arrows,
     c. are hung upon poles fixed around the canoe. Next comes the tribute of
wailing, which husbands and wives owe to each other, and to their deceased parents,
and also to their children: for a month, and often longer, they continually shed,
night and day, tears, accompanied with cries and groans, that are heard at a great
distance. If the canoe happen to fall down in course of time, the remains of the
deceased are collected, covered again with a winding-sheet, and deposited in another
canoe.       Extract of a letter from M. Demers, Missionary among the Savages.


Some individuals of other tribes, seen by Father de Smet on his tour, are the
following: The Kootenays and the Carriers, with a population of 4,000 souls,
the Savages of the Lake, who are computed at about 500, the Cauldrons 600, the
Okinaganes 1,100, the Jantons and Santees 300, the Jantonnees 4,500, the Black-Feet
Scioux 1,500, the Two-Cauldrons 800, the Ampapas 2,000, the Burned 2,500,
the Lack-Bows 1,000, the Minikomjoos 2,000, the Ogallallees 1,500, the Saoynes
2,000, the Unkepatines 2,000, the Mandans, Big-Bellies, and Arikaras,
who have formed of their remnants one tribe, 3,000, the Pierced-Noses,
2,500, the Kayuses 2,000, the Walla-Wallas 500, the Palooses 300, the Spokanes
800, the Pointed-Hearts 700, the Crows, the Assinboins, the Ottos, the Pawnees,
the Santees, the Renards, the Aonays, the Kikapoux, the Delawares, and the
Shawanons, whose numbers are unknown. The following are the names of the
principal chiefs, who received the Missionary in their tents: The Big-Face and
Walking-Bear, the Patriarchs of the Flat-Heads and Ponderas; the Iron-Crow,
the Good-Heart, the Dog's-Hand, the Black-Eyes, the Man that does not eat
cow's flesh, and the Warrior who walks barefooted; the last named is chief of
the Black-Feet Scioux.       De Smet.



[118] "Sampeetch" was a term applied to a small band of Ute dwelling in central Utah along the river now known as San Pitch, with a valley and mountain ranges
of the same designation. The name was frequently used in descriptions of Ute
bands until about 1870, when these Indians, reduced in number to less than two
hundred, were segregated upon the Unita reservation and lost their distinctive
appellation.       Ed.



[119] In Voyages aux Montagnes Rocheuses, containing the French original of
this letter, Father de Smet classes the Paiute and Yampah Ute with the Sampeetches
as the tribes called by the French les Dignes de pitié.       Ed.



[120] The following account of the religious beliefs relates to the mountain tribes
with whom De Smet was most familiar, chiefly those of the Salishan stock.       Ed.



[121] A Canadian Missionary, who lived for a long time among the savages, gives the following account of the popular tradition of the Indians respecting the creation
of the world:       "Water, they say, was every where formerly; and Wiskain,
a spirit, or subordinate deity, commanded the castor to dive into it, in order to
procure some earth. The castor obeyed the order, but he was so fat that he could
not possibly descend to the bottom, and he had to return without any earth. Wiskain,
nothing discouraged, charged the musk-rat with the commission which the
castor was unable to perform. The new messenger having remained a long while
under water, and with as little success as the castor, returned almost drowned.
The rat expected that he should not be required a second time, as he had already
nearly lost his life. But Wiskain, who was not discouraged by obstacles, directed
the rat to dive again, promising him, that if he should happen to be drowned, he
(Wiskain) would restore him to life. The rat dived a second time, and made
the greatest efforts to comply with Wiskain's orders. After remaining a considerable
while under the water, he arose to the surface, but so exhausted by fatigue
that he was insensible. Wiskain, upon a careful and minute examination, finds
at length in the claws of the poor animal a little earth, upon which he breathes
with such effect, that it begins to augment rapidly. When he had thus blown
for a long time, feeling anxious to know if the earth was large enough, he ordered
the crow, which at that period was as white as the swan, to fly round it, and take
its dimensions. The crow did accordingly, and returned, saying that the work
was too small. Wiskain set about blowing upon the earth with renewed ardour,
and directed the crow to make a second tour round it, cautioning him, at the same
time, not to feed upon any carcass that he might see on the way. The crow set
off again without complaint, and found, at the place which had been pointed out,
the carcass which he was forbidden to touch. But, having grown hungry on the
way, and being also, perhaps, excited by gluttony, he filled himself with the infected
meat, and on his return to Wiskain, informed him that the earth was large enough,
and that he need not, therefore, resume his work. But the unfaithful messenger,
at his return, found himself as black as he had been white at his setting out, and
was thus punished for his disobedience, and the black colour communicated to
his descendants." The above tradition, which bears some striking vestiges of the
tradition respecting original sin, and several circumstances of the deluge, makes
no mention whatever of the creation of man and woman; and, however illogical
it may be, it is, perhaps, not more ridiculous than the systems of certain pretended
philosophers of the last century, who, in hatred of revelation, have endeavoured
to explain the formation of the earth, by substituting their extravagant reveries
for the Mosaic account.       De Smet.

Cox, Adventures on the Columbia River (New York, 1832), pp. 121-127.       Ed.



[125] Probably our author here refers to the sage-brush of the Western plains,
Artemisia tridentata.       Ed.



[126] De Smet had accompanied the Indians in their journey from Pierre's Hole
westward and then northward along the Teton River to its junction with the
Henry; thence they proceeded up that stream to its source in Henry Lake, the
northeastern corner of Idaho. As the source of a chief fork of the Snake, this
is one of the mountain origins of the Columbia. It was named for Andrew Henry,
an adventurous trader, for whom see our volume xv, p. 246, note 107.       Ed.



[127] Probably the stream that runs into Red Rock Lake, in southwestern Montana,
the source of Jefferson River, the main branch of the Missouri.       Ed.



[128] This was the main chain of the Rockies, on the boundary between Idaho
and Montana, just above the present Reynolds Pass.       Ed.



[129] In this letter, Father de Smet does not describe his movements with the
Flatheads, who having crossed to Red Rock Lake advanced slowly down the
Jefferson until August 21, where they camped at the Three Forks of Missouri,
and prepared to lay in their winter's supply of buffalo meat. There he left them
for his return to St. Louis.       Ed.



[130] As a beautiful specimen of an affecting farewell address, we take from the
journal of a Canadian Missionary the following discourse spoken by one of the
savages of the Red River, to the Black-Gown who had converted them, when he
was about leaving them. After expressing, in the name of all the Indians of
his locality, the grief which they felt at the Missionary's departure, he added the
following words, which prove their gratitude to the worthy Priest, who had brought
to them the truths of salvation, and to the members of the Society for the Propagation
of the Faith, whose charity had procured them so great a benefit:       


"Dear Father, you are going to leave us, but we hope to see you again. We are quite sensible that you naturally wish to see your relations and friends, your
towns and country       we shall find the time of your absence very long, but the
winter is soon over.       We conceived it to be our duty to assemble before your
departure, and to express our feelings. We shall only say these few words: we
formerly led very wicked lives, and we know this day to what destruction we were
hastening. There was a thick cloud before our eyes; you have dispersed it; we
see the sun. We shall never forget what you have done and suffered for us.       Go
now, go and tell the Prayers, those kind Prayers, who take pity on us; who
love us without knowing us; and who send us priests; go and tell them that
savages know how to remember a benefit; go and tell them that we also pray
for them, in the desire which we feel to know them, one day, in the abode of
our common Father. Set out, but return and instruct those whom you have
baptized: leave us not forever in affliction; depart, and in the meanwhile remember
that we are counting the days."       De Smet.



[131] De Smet thus describes his route: "For two days we were going up the Gallatin,
the southern fork of the Missouri; thence we crossed by a narrow pass
(Bozeman's) thirty miles in length to the Yellowstone river, the second of the
great tributaries of the Missouri."       Chittenden and Richardson, De Smet, i,

[134] In prehistoric times, the horse was indigenous in America. Evidence thereof
was collected by Professor O. C. Marsh, and has recently been corroborated by
the results of the Whitney Exploring Expedition; see H. F. Osborn, "Evolution
of the Horse in America," in Century Magazine, lxix, pp. 3-17. Why this animal
became extinct on the western continent is unknown; but it seems certain that
the Spanish discoverers found no trace thereof among the American Indians, and
that the horses of the plains Indians were derived from those lost or abandoned
by or stolen from the Spanish conquerors of Mexico. These soon reverted to a
wild state and became what De Smet calls "the Maroon race of the prairies."
Upon the changes in the economy of life among American aborigines, brought
about by their possession of the horse, consult A. F. Bandelier, "Investigations
in the Southwest," in Archæological Institute of America Papers, American Series,
iii, p. 211.       Ed.



[135] Absaroka (Upsahroku) is the name by which the Crows know themselves,
although according to Lewis and Clark it designated but one band of the tribe.
Its significance is uncertain, although usually thought to be a certain species of
hawk. The name "Crow"       literally raven, but translated "Corbeaux" by the French       is an Anglicized form of the name given to this tribe by the surrounding
Indians, and may refer to their pilfering tendencies. See our volume v, p. 226,

[141] See the brief account of Arikara jugglers in Maximilian's Travels, our volume
xxiii, pp. 393, 394       Ed.



[142] Juggleries are much practised among the savages, although many of them
consider them as so many impostures. Mr. Belcourt, who witnessed a great
many of them, always succeeded in discovering the deception. One of the most
celebrated jugglers acknowledged, after his conversion to Christianity, that all
their delusion consists in their cleverness in preparing certain tricks, and in the
assurance with which they predict to others what they themselves know not, and,
above all, in the silly credulity of their admirers. They are like our own calculators
of horoscopes.       Extract from the Journal of a Missionary in Canada.       De

[145] De Smet had been associated with Nicollet in his exploration of the Missouri
River in 1839. Nicollet intended another expedition westward, but was detained
in Washington by business connected with the publication of his hydrographical
map, and the report to Congress, and was never again in the Western country.
See his letter in Chittenden and Richardson, De Smet, iv, pp. 1552, 1553.


Jean Nicolas Nicollet was born in Savoy in 1786. After being educated in
Switzerland, he was for a time assistant professor of mathematics at Chambery,
and later librarian and secretary at the Paris observatory under the celebrated
La Place. In 1832 he came to America, and occupied himself in scientific exploration
of the Arkansas and Red rivers. In 1836 he made his well-known voyage
to the sources of the Mississippi, and in 1839 explored the Missouri, crossing over
to the Red River Valley, being accompanied on this expedition by John C. Frémont.
The following years, until his death in 1843, he was employed in government
service at Washington.       Ed.



[146] This was the first overland emigrant train to California, composed of members
of the Western Emigration Society, organized in the winter of 1840-41 in Platte County, Missouri, under the stimulus of reports of the fertility and beauty
of California, brought back by one of the Roubidoux brothers. Discouraged
by contrary accounts, most of the members of the society withdrew, leaving John
Bidwell to organize the caravan, which finally consisted of sixty-nine persons, exclusive
of De Smet's party. See Bidwell's account in Century Magazine, xix,
pp. 106-120. De Smet's party of eleven consisted of the priests and brothers,
one guide, one hunter, and three French Canadian drivers.       Ed.



[147] See De Smet's letter on securing funds, and preparations, in Chittenden and
Richardson, De Smet, i, pp. 272-275.       Ed.



[148] Father Nicolas Point was sojourning at Westport when De Smet returned
from his first mission to the Flatheads. Selected to accompany the new mission,
Father Point served at St. Mary's until 1842, when after a summer with the Indians
on a buffalo hunt, he founded in the autumn of that year the C      ur d'Alène
mission. This he made the seat of his work until his recall in 1846. On his return journey he spent some months among the Blackfeet, laying the foundation
for the work that later ripened into St. Peter's mission. He baptized over six
hundred persons, chiefly children, and turned to much advantage his talent for
drawing, whereby he attracted the indifferent tribesmen. He passed the ensuing
winter at Fort Union, where he exercised a salutary restraint over the lawless
traders and half-breeds. See Historical Society of Montana Contributions, iii,
pp. 246-248. The next spring he was sent to Upper Canada, and died at Quebec
in 1868.       Ed.



[149] Henri de Verger, count de La Rochejacquelein (1772-94), was one of the
most popular generals of the Vendéan peasants, during their revolt against the
republic of the French Revolution. He had been a member of the king's guard,
but after the famous Tenth of August retreated to his ancestral home, and there
put himself at the head of the uprising, and although but twenty-one years of
age was chosen general-in-chief (1793). His courage and military daring made
him the favorite hero of the royalists. He was killed by a republican soldier.       Ed.



[150] Father Gregory Mengarini remained in charge of the Flathead mission at
St. Mary's until 1850. He was an accomplished linguist, and so mastered the
Indian dialect that by means of his speech he could pass for a Flathead. He
printed a Salishan grammar (1861), and prepared a Salishan-English dictionary.
In 1850 it was decided to abandon St. Mary's for a time, whereupon Father Mengarini
retired to the newly-established Jesuit college at Santa Clara, California,
where he died in 1886. For his portrait see Palladino, Indian and White in the
Northwest, p. 31.       Ed.



[151] William Claessens lived at the Flathead mission until near the close of his
life. Ordered to Santa Clara, California, to rest, he died there (October 11, 1891),
just after celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of his entrance upon missionary work.
For his portrait see ibid., p. 62.


Joseph Specht never permanently left the Flathead mission, dying at St. Ignatius
in 1884, one of the oldest white inhabitants of Montana. For his portrait
see ibid., p. 60.


Charles Huet joined Father Point in establishing the C      ur d'Alène mission.
See ante, note 67.       Ed.



[152] De Smet went up to Westport by the "Oceana," a steamboat of about 300
tons, built in 1836.       Ed.



[153] A mission school was established among the Shawnee in 1829 by Reverend Thomas Johnson of the Missouri conference of the Methodist church, and was
conducted by that missionary and his wife, and Reverend and Mrs. William Johnson.
In 1839 the school was removed to a location about two miles southwest of
Westport, where a grant of land was secured, and an industrial school maintained
for Indian children until 1862.       Ed.



[154] For the early stretch of the Oregon Trail see Wyeth's Oregon, in our volume
xxi, p. 49, note 30. The California emigrants were met at Sapling Grove.

[155] Soldier's Creek, a northern tributary of the Kansas, entering the latter just
below Topeka, near the Kansas River fording place.       Ed.



[156] The Englishman's name was Romaine. He had come up from New Orleans
on a hunting trip, and accompanied the caravan as far as Green River. De Smet
testifies to his engaging qualities, his skill as a hunter, and his courtesy in camp.


The Kansa village here visited was near the mouth of Vermillion Creek, in
Pottawatomie County (not to be confused with the Black Vermillion, tributary
of the Big Blue). When Frémont passed this way in 1842, the village was deserted,
having the preceding spring suffered a Pawnee attack.       Ed.

Irving's semi-humorous description of him occurs in The Rocky Mountains (Captain
Bonneville's Journal), chapter ii.       Ed.



[160] Charles de la Croix, born at Hoorebeke, Belgium, 1792, was impressed into the imperial guards; but escaping with difficulty from Paris in 1814, was
ordained for the American mission. He arrived in the United States in 1817,
at first being made pastor at Barrens, Missouri. In 1820 he became curé at
Florissant, whence he made two visits (1821-22) to the territory of the Osage,
but was compelled by illness to return. Upon the coming of the Jesuits to Florissant
(1823) he resigned his charge to them, becoming pastor of St. Michael's
parish, Louisiana, where he remained until failing health made necessary his
return to Europe (1834). He served as canon of the cathedral at Ghent until his
death in 1869.       Ed.



[161] De Smet probably intends the chapel at Westport, where Father Point was
stationed before his departure for the Flathead country.       Ed.



[162] For the Pawnee bands see our volume xiv, p. 233, note 179. Their depredations
were nearly as much dreaded by the traders on the southern routes, as
those of the Blackfeet were in northern climes.       Ed.



[163] De Smet refers here to the medicine bundle. One of these belonged to each
family of importance, and a still more sacred one to each band of the tribe. Its
contents were various, frequently containing skins of sacred birds, although not
exclusively so composed. See John B. Dunbar, "Pawnee Indians," in Magazine
of American History, viii, pp. 738-741.       Ed.



[164] This custom of human sacrifice appears to have been confined to the Skidi or Loup band of Pawnee, and to have been abolished only with much difficulty.
James's Long's Expedition, in our volume xv, pp. 151-155, relates the rescue of
one such captive in 1817, and the apparent abolition of the custom. John T.
Irving, Jr., Indian Sketches (Philadelphia, 1835), ii, pp. 146-153, describes an
ineffectual attempt in 1831 to rescue a captive designed for this fate. The account
given by De Smet of the sacrifice of 1837 appears to be authentic. Dunbar (op.
cit. in preceding note) says that the last known instance occurred in April, 1838;
but probably it has been repeated since. See also George B. Grinnell, Pawnee
Hero Stories and Folk Tales (New York, 1893), pp. 363-369; and George A.
Dorsey, "Traditions of the Skidi Pawnee," in American Folk Lore Society Publications

note 33.       Ed.



[166] The route followed from the point where the trail reached the Platte, was
along the river to its forks, thence up the South Fork to its ford, across to the
North Fork at Ash Creek, along the south bank of the former stream to the junction
of the Laramie, thence continuing by the North Fork to its crossing, near the present
Caspar, Wyoming, and along the north bank, across country to the Sweetwater,
to avoid the cañon of the North Platte.       Ed.

known as wormwood or absinth (A. absinthium). See ante, p. 174, note 44.       Ed.



[170] Bidwell thus describes this landmark: "A noted landmark on the North
Fork, which we sighted fifty miles away, was Chimney Rock. It was then nearly
square, and I think it must have been fifty feet higher than now, though after
we passed it a portion fell off." Century Magazine, xix, p. 118.       Ed.



[171] See engravings of these fantastically cut rocks in Century Magazine, op.
cit., p. 121.       Ed.



[172] Bidwell mentions both the cyclone with its destructive hail, and the water-spout
which passed a quarter of a mile behind the camp.       Ed.

[174] Maria's River, for which see our volume xxiii, p. 84, note 73.       Ed.



[175] Dearborn River, named by Lewis and Clark (1805) for the secretary of war,
was in reality a western affluent above, not below, the Great Falls. By "Fancy,"
De Smet probably intends the stream named by Lewis and Clark "Tansy," but
now known as Teton River       a tributary, however, of Maria's River, although
approaching very near the Missouri.       Ed.

known as the Platte purchase.       Ed.



[183] These are all Missouri streams, mentioned for the most part by Lewis and
Clark (see Original Journals, index). Upon Wood River (Du Bois) the expedition
rendezvoused during the winter of 1803-04.       Ed.



[184] For this first deputation see Townsend's Narrative, in our volume xxi, p. 138,
note 13. The deputies apparently arrived in the autumn of 1831 and passed the
winter in or near the city, where two of their number died. See Chittenden and
Richardson, De Smet, i, pp. 21, 22.       Ed.



[185] Both the second and third embassies were headed by the Iroquois Indian
known as "Old Ignace," otherwise Ignace la Mousse, who was educated at the
mission of Caughnawaga, and had gone to the Rocky Mountains between 1812
and 1820. The Iroquois were much employed by the North West Company and
later by the Hudson's Bay Company, to assist fur-trading parties in the Far West.
Ignace settled among the Flatheads, where he married, and taught the tribe the
rudiments of the religion he had learned at the Canadian mission. Townsend
(see our volume xxi) notes their observance of Sunday, and forms of worship.
The delegation which Ignace undertook for the purpose of securing a "black
robe," set out in 1835. His first intention was to visit Canada, but learning that
Jesuits were at St. Louis he journeyed thither, taking with him his two sons to
be baptized. See Palladino, Indian and White in the Northwest, pp. 19, 20,
where a record of this baptism is given. Again in 1837, Ignace headed a second
delegation. Upon the South Platte they were overtaken by a band of Sioux, who
at first dismissed Ignace, for he was dressed as a white man. Unwilling to
abandon his companions, he declared himself an Indian, whereupon all were
killed after a brave defense.       Ed.



[186] Young Ignace, who accompanied Father de Smet on his first visit (1840)
to the Flatheads, became a zealous convert, and lived at St. Ignatius mission until
his death in the winter of 1875-76.       Ed.



[187] For further details of this exploit of Pilchimo see letter ix, post.       Ed.



[188] This Indian was known as Francis Saxa, and as late as 1903 was living
on his own ranch in Missoula County. See his portrait in Palladino, Indian and
White in the Northwest, p. 20.       Ed.



[189] Francis Ermatinger, one of the chief factors for the Hudson's Bay Company,
came to the Columbia region about 1824; two years later he was in command of
Fort Kamloops when Governor Simpson passed that way. In 1828, he appears
to have been stationed at Fort Okinagan on the upper Columbia, while Wyeth
met him in the Snake River country in 1832-34. He married a niece of Madame
McLoughlin, wife of the governor of Vancouver, and held various important
stations. In the autumn of the year in which De Smet encountered him, he led
the brigade into California as far as Yerba Buena (San Francisco). Upon the
establishment of the provincial government in Oregon, he was elected (1845)
treasurer. He is thought to have ultimately retired to Canada.       Ed.



[190] For Fort Hall see our volume xxi, p. 210, note 51 (Townsend).       Ed.



[191] Bidwell (Century Magazine, xix, p. 120) gives the names of three in addition
to Romaine, the Englishman       Peyton, Rodgers, and Amos E. Frye. Thirty-two
of the California party went on to Fort Hall with the missionaries, while the
remainder, among them Bidwell, branched off to the west from Soda Springs.       Ed.



[192] For Bear River and Soda Springs see Townsend's Narrative, in our volume
xxi, pp. 199, 200, notes 44, 45.       Ed.



[193] According to Bidwell (op. cit., p. 120), these two men were Bartleson, from Jackson County, Missouri, and "a Methodist Episcopal preacher, whose name
I think was also Williams."       Ed.



[194] This cañon of the Sweetwater is about five miles above Independence Rock.
It is a cut about three hundred yards long, and thirty-five wide through a spur
of the mountains in Natrona County, Wyoming. See illustration of cañon in
Frémont's "Exploring Tour," Senate Docs., 28 Cong., 2 sess., 174, p. 57.       Ed.



[195] The ascent of the South Pass is so gradual that without instruments it is
difficult to know when one attains the summit. See Wyeth's Oregon, in our
volume xxi, p. 58, note 37.       Ed.



[196] For Little and Big Sandy, see Townsend's Narrative, in our volume xxi,
p. 187, note 36. The former was the beginning of Sublette's Cut Off, sometimes
called the "Dry Drive," because of scarcity of water on the route. This
crossed directly to Bear River, without passing southward by Fort Bridger. Such
would seem to have been the route taken by De Smet's company. The regular
trail went down the Big Sandy, forded Green River near its forks, and proceeded
across to the site of Fort Bridger, founded two years later.       Ed.



[197] Captain Bonneville's expedition of 1832 was the first to cross the Green
River in wagons. See Irving, Rocky Mountains, chapter ii.       Ed.



[198] They were in reality upon Green River, a tributary of the Colorado. See
Wyeth's Oregon, in our volume xxi, p. 60, note 38.       Ed.



[199] Captain Henry Fraeb (Frapp), who was one of the partners of the Rocky
Mountain Fur Company (1830-34). He was well known in the mountain fur-trade,
frequently being associated therein with Fitzpatrick, De Smet's guide.
According to Bidwell, he was killed the night after leaving this party; Frémont
says       Exploring Expedition, p. 40       that this occurred the latter part
of August, 1841, in a battle with Sioux and Cheyenne.       Ed.



[200] This tribe is often classified with the Digger Indians, for whom see ante,
p. 167, note 38; but the latter possessed no horses. The Soshocoes (Shoshocoes)
appear to be a band of the Shoshoni proper       closely allied, as De Smet notes,
but with less property, and less virile in character. They were the branch of
Shoshoni which had their roving habitat along the banks of the Green River;
whereas the Shoshoni (or Snake) roved chiefly on Lewis River.       Ed.



[201] The name of Don Quixote's steed, a charger all skin and bone.       Ed.



[202] For these springs see Townsend's Narrative, in our volume xxi, p. 200, note
45.       Ed.



[203] This was the route by which the trail crossed from the waters of the Colorado
to those of the Lewis, a difficult mountain path in Bannock County, Idaho,
approximating the route of the Oregon Short Line Railway.       Ed.



[204] The captain and guide of this expedition was Thomas Fitzpatrick, for whom
see Townsend's Narrative, in our volume xxi, p. 192, note 40. See De Smet's
letter recommending his services, in Chittenden and Richardson, De Smet, iv,
p. 1465.       Ed.



[205] The Portneuf River, for which see our volume xxi, p. 209, note 49 (Townsend).
This characteristic of the Portneuf       a series of dams of mineral deposit       make
it a beautiful succession of still, dark pools and foaming cascades, and
may now be noted from the windows of trains on the Oregon Short Line Railway.       Ed.



[206] Beaverhead River is the main branch of the Jefferson, one of the three great
sources of the Missouri. It runs through a mountainous valley in a county of
the same name, in which is located Dillon, the chief town of southwestern Montana.
The valley is named for a rocky point that bears a resemblance to the head
of a beaver. Lewis and Clark were the first white men known to have visited
this locality. The cliff they called "Beaverhead" is now known as "Point of
Rocks," about eighteen miles north of Dillon. See Original Journals of the Lewis
and Clark Expedition, ii, p. 321.       Ed.



[207] The principal chief of the Flathead tribe was an hereditary officer. This
chief, whose Indian name was Tjolzhitsay, the equivalent of Big or Long Face,
was the first of the nation to be baptized in 1840. For a further account of his
life see letter ix, post.       Ed.



[208] Ludovico Antonio Muratori (1672-1750) was by many accounted the foremost
scholar and antiquarian of his time. Born near Modena, he was appointed
keeper of public archives at that place, and seldom left the city. His chief work
was in the classics, publishing Anecdota Græca and Anecdota Latina, valuable
collections of hitherto unedited fragments. Through a fellow-townsman who went
as missionary to the Jesuit community in Paraguay, Father Muratori became interested
in that land and wrote in Italian Il Christianesimo Felice nelle Missione dei
Padri della Compagnia di Jesu nel Paraguai (Venice, 1743). He states in the
preface that his information was derived from the memoirs of the Jesuits, and
from conversations and correspondence with those who had lived in Paraguay.
This work was translated into several languages, the English version having been
published at London in 1759. Muratori represents the Jesuit community of
converted Indians as a veritable earthly paradise. De Smet's reference to this
work shows his ambition to establish a Paraguayan régime in the continent of
America.       Ed.



[209] With his party, De Smet advanced up the Snake or Lewis River to its forks,
of which Henry's is the most northern, rising in Henry's Lake (see ante, p. 175,
note 45). This arid valley, of which the missionary speaks, has been proved
fertile under the influence of irrigation. Several millions of dollars have in recent
years been invested in irrigation canals, along the valley of the upper Lewis,
through which runs a spur of the Oregon Short Line Railway.       Ed.



[210] For the Three Buttes and Three Tetons see Townsend's Narrative, in our
volume xxi, p. 209, note 49.       Ed.



[211] The travellers passed by Beaverhead Valley, where the main body of the
Flathead met them, by the well-known trace along the Big Hole and across the
divide into Deer Lodge Valley       the route now followed substantially by the
Oregon Short Line Railway. "Father's Defile" must have been near the Deer
Lodge divide.       Ed.



[212] Deer Lodge takes its name from a spring around which many white-tailed
deer were wont to assemble. The mineral deposit had piled in a conical heap, forming the shape of an Indian lodge. These are now called Warm Springs,
and used for medicinal purposes. The name Deer Lodge is now applied to the
river and its valley, to a Montana county, and to the seat of that county. The
valley is fertile. In its lower course the river called Hell Gate united with Bitterroot
(or St. Mary's) at Missoula.       Ed.



[213] For a description of this plant see our volume xv, pp. 232, 233. It is allied
to the Yucca filamentosa of the Southern states, whence its name of "Adam's
needle." It is more commonly called silk or bear grass, and its filaments were used for weaving by the Indians of the Columbia, whence it became an article
of intertribal trade. See Original Journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition,
index.       Ed.



[214] For the scientific names of these species, see ibid., index.       Ed.



[215] Stories of this sort are numerous; the discarded beaver is, however, the
victim of disease, being attacked by a parasite. Consult Martin, Castorologia,
or the Canadian Beaver (London and Montreal, 1892), pp. 159, 168, 233.       Ed.



[216] See our volume xix, p. 328, note 138 (Gregg).       Ed.



[217] Father Charles Felix Van Quickenborne was a Belgian, born in Ghent in 1788.
Coming to America he was made master of novices at Whitemarsh, and in 1823
removed to Florissant, Missouri, being made superior of his order in the West.
He was zealous for Indian missions, in 1827-28 visiting in person the Osage; and
in 1836 founding the Kickapoo mission. He died at Portage des Sioux, August
17, 1836, having revived the missions of his order to the North American
aborigines.       Ed.



[218] John Gray was an old mountaineer, probably acting on this journey as
guide to the Englishman who was out for big game. See an account of a trapper
of this name in Alexander Ross, Fur Hunters of the Far West (London, 1855),
ii, chapter x.       Ed.



[219] It is now accepted that there are but two species of bears in the United
States; the black (Ursus americanus), of which the cinnamon bear is a variety,
and the grizzly (Ursus horribilis), known as the white, grey, and brown bear.
The episode here related by De Smet may be found in Original Journals of
the Lewis and Clark Expedition, ii, pp. 33, 34.       Ed.



[220] Hell Gate is the defile just east of Missoula, Montana, on a river of that
name. It is said to have acquired its name (French, porte d'enfer) because the
Blackfeet so often lay in wait along its cliffs, and to pass through was as dangerous
as entering hell. In the early days of the territory there was a settlement
known as Hell Gate, about five miles up the river, from its mouth.       Ed.



[221] For a further description of these bull-boats see our volume xxiii, p. 279,
note 246.       Ed.



[222] Compare Bidwell's account in Century Magazine, xix, p. 116. According
to his report, it was a war party of but forty well-mounted Cheyenne. The young
American had been unduly excited by their appearance, and was thereafter known
as Cheyenne Dawson. His baptismal name was James. Reaching California
with the Bidwell party, he was later drowned in Columbia River.       Ed.



[223] For the Bannock Indians see Townsend's Narrative, in our volume xxi,
p. 192, note 41.       Ed.



[224] The massacre of these travellers gave rise to several vague reports. As
we had started together it was supposed by many that we had not yet separated
when this unfortunate accident took place. Hence it was circulated in the United
States, and even in some parts of Europe, that the Catholic Missionaries had
all been killed by the Indians.       De Smet.



[225] The Bitterroot River rises in two forks in the main chain of the Rockies,
on the northern slope of the divide between Montana and Idaho, and flows almost
directly north through a beautiful, fertile valley, until at Fort Missoula it unites
with the Hell Gate to form Missoula River. The name is derived from the plant
Lewisia rediviva (French, racine amère), which was occasionally used by the Indians
as food. The name St. Mary's River, assigned by Father de Smet, is
frequently found on early maps.       Ed.



[226] The site of St. Mary's mission was on the east bank of the Bitterroot, about
eighteen miles above its mouth, near old Fort Owen and the modern Stevensville.
For the further history of St. Mary's mission see Palladino, Indian and White in
the Northwest, pp. 32-67.       Ed.



[227] The C      ur d'Alène (awl-hearted) Indians are a branch of the Salishan
family, whose tribal name is Skitswish (Lewis and Clark, Skeetsomish). Many unauthenticated traditions are afloat in regard to the origin of this term, which
seems to be allied to some form of parsimony. The habitat of this tribe, near the
lake of that name in northern Idaho, is still the seat of their reservation, which
was set off in 1867, but not occupied until after the treaty of 1873. The tribal
population has been almost stationary since first known, numbering nearly five
hundred. Their language is quite similar to the Spokan. The C      ur d'Alène
are agriculturists, wear civilized dress, and are now receiving their lands by allotment.       Ed.



[228] This was the estimated number of Indians under Jesuit control in Paraguay,
at the time of greatest prosperity.       Ed.



[229] This Pend d'Oreille's native name was Chalax, and he is said to have been
before his baptism a famous medicine man.       Ed.



[230] For the Spokan see Franchère's Narrative, in our volume vi, p. 341, note
146.       Ed.



[231] Two South American tribes of eastern Bolivia, who long resisted the Spaniards,
but yielded finally to Jesuit missionaries. The mission to the Chiquito
was begun in 1691; they were gathered into two villages, and easily civilized.       Ed.



[232] Baptized as Ambrose, and one of the most faithful converts. He was
living in 1859. See Chittenden and Richardson, De Smet, index.       Ed.



[233] Another title for Michael, or Insula; see ante, p. 147, note 13.       Ed.



[234] The context proves this to be a misprint for 1841.       Ed.



[235] Nicholas Patrick Stephen Wiseman (1802-65), born in Seville of Irish parents,
was inducted into holy orders at Rome in 1824. He was a noted scholar and controversialist,
well known to the English-speaking world, and closely connected
with the Oxford movement. In 1848 he was made cardinal-archbishop of Westminster,
whereupon he issued an Appeal to Reason and Good Feeling, which won
him many friends among the English people.       Ed.



[236] Probably Jean François de La Harpe (1739-1803), a French critic and
satirist, who from being a Voltairean became an ardent Christian in the latter years
of his life.       Ed.



[237] James Bridger was for nearly fifty years well known as a trapper, hunter,
and guide throughout the Rocky Mountains. De Smet speaks of him as "one of
the truest specimens of a real trapper and Rocky Mountain man." Born in
Virginia in 1804, his parents removed to Missouri before the War of 1812-15. He
was first apprenticed to a St. Louis blacksmith, but as early as 1822 went to the
mountains with Andrew Henry. Becoming one of Ashley's band, he explored
Great Salt Lake in 1824-25, and by 1830 had visited Yellowstone Park. He
afterwards entered the American Fur Company, in whose service he was retained
until he built Fort Bridger in 1843. There he lived for many years with his Indian
(Shoshoni) wife, greatly aiding Western emigration. His ability as a topographer
was remarkable, and he knew the trans-Mississippi country as did few others.
His services as a guide were, therefore, in great demand for all government and
large private expeditions, General Sheridan consulting him in reference to an
Indian campaign as late as 1868. As the West became civilized, and lost its distinctive
frontier features, Bridger retired to a farm near Kansas City, where he
died in 1881. His name is attached to several Western regions, notably Bridger's
Peak, in southwestern Montana. For his portrait (taken about 1865) see Montana
Historical Society Contributions, iii, p. 181; the figure of the "Trapper"
in the dome of the Montana State capitol at Helena, is also said to be a portrait
of this picturesque character. Bridger was so noted for his remarkable tales
of Western adventures and wonders that his descriptions of Yellowstone Park
were long uncredited, being contemptuously referred to as "Jim Bridger's lies."
Apropos of this tale of arrow-wounds, it may be noted that in 1835 Dr. Marcus
Whitman extracted from Bridger's shoulder an iron arrowhead that had been
embedded therein for several years.       Ed.



[238] Clark's River (or more exactly, Clark's Fork of Columbia) was named by
the explorers Lewis and Clark September 6, 1805, upon reaching the upper forks of its tributary the Bitterroot. It takes the name of Missoula from the junction
of Bitterroot and Hell Gate rivers, but becomes distinctly Clark's Fork after receiving
its great tributary from the northeast, the Flathead River. Its general course
is north from the southern border of Montana, until turning slightly northwest
it crosses into Idaho and broadens out into Pend d'Oreille Lake, running thence
in a northwest course until it empties into the Columbia just on the boundary
line between Washington and British Columbia. The bands referred to as "Clarke
River" tribes are chiefly of Salishan stock       the Flatheads, C      ur d'Alène, and
Pend d'Oreille.       Ed.



[239] For the Chinook (Tchenook) Indians see our volume vi, p. 240, note 40.       Ed.



[240] For Charlevoix see our volume xiii, p. 116, notes 81, 82.       Ed.



[241] The following description is taken almost verbatim from the book of Ross
Cox, Adventures on the Columbia River (New York, 1832), pp. 328-330. By the
Calkobins is intended the Talkotins, a poor rendering of the Indian tribal name
Lhtho'ten, or people of Fraser River. This was a tribe of Carrier (Taculli) Indians
of the Tinneh stock, who inhabited the region around the fur-trade post of
Alexandria, on Fraser River. By a census of about 1825 they numbered but 166;
the revolting customs relative to the disposal of the dead were, however, common
to all the Carrier Indians, whose name is said by some to have been given because
of the burden of their husband's ashes, worn by the widows of the tribe. More
probably, the name was derived from their function of aiding in "carries" or
portages across the upper Rockies.


New Caledonia was discovered by Alexander Mackenzie in 1793; its posts
were begun under Simon Fraser (1805-06). During the fur-trading period, it
was an important division of the Hudson's Bay Company's Pacific provinces;
but was dependent upon the Columbia district, with headquarters at Vancouver.
The chief posts of New Caledonia were St. James, Stuart Lake, and Alexandria.
For its boundaries, etc., consult Ross's Oregon Settlers, in our volume vii, p. 194,
note 61.       Ed.



[242] Sanpoil has been variously interpreted as a French word (meaning "without
hairs") or as the English rendering of a native word. They were a tribe of Salishan
stock, resident upon the upper Columbia, near a river in northeastern Washington
called from their name. The Sanpoil did not prove amenable to missionary effort.
The governor of Washington Territory in 1870 represents them as the least civilized
and most independent aborigines of the territory, clinging to their native
religion and customs. Since then, they have been located on the Colville reservation,
where their reputation for honesty and industry is not high. With their
near kindred the Nespelin, they number about four hundred.       Ed.



[243] The Chaudière (or Kettle) Indians were so named from their habitat near
Kettle Falls of the Columbia. Their native name was Shwoyelpi (Skoyelpi),
rendered Wheelpoo by Lewis and Clark. They were early brought under Catholic
influence, becoming satisfactory neophytes. The original tribe became extinct
about 1854; but their place was supplied by natives of the vicinity, of similar
origin. They are now known as Colville Indians, and to the number of about
three hundred live on the reservation of that name, where the majority are
Catholic communicants.       Ed.

Narrative, in our volume xxi, pp. 296, 297, notes 81, 82.       Ed.



[245] Francis Norbert Blanchet had been a parish priest in the diocese of Montreal.
In 1838, when a call came from the Canadians in the valley of the Willamette
for a priest to minister to their settlement, Blanchet was sent out with the Hudson's
Bay brigade, arriving at Fort Vancouver in the autumn of that year. Early in
January, 1840, St. Paul's parish, in Willamette Valley, was established by Blanchet,
and the church erected therefor in 1836 was occupied. In 1843 Blanchet
was appointed vicar apostolic of the territory of the British crown west of the
Rockies. Going to Montreal for consecration, he afterwards visited Europe,
where he was created archbishop of Oregon, with a seat at Oregon City. For
his portrait see Lyman, Oregon (New York, 1903), iii, p. 422. His Historical
Sketches of the Catholic church in Oregon during the past forty years was published
at Portland in 1878.       Ed.



[246] Madison River is one of the three upper branches of the Missouri. Rising
in Yellowstone Park, it is formed by the junction of Gibbon and Firehole rivers,
and at first flows north through a mountainous and rocky country; but in its
lower reaches courses through a fertile valley.       Ed.



[247] Fort Colville was a Hudson's Bay Company post, built in 1825 to supersede
the fort at Spokane, which was too far inland for convenient access. The
site was at Kettle Falls on the east bank of the stream (see Alexander Ross, Fur
Hunters, ii, p. 162), the post being named for the London governor of the company,
Eden Colville. The fort became an important station on the route of the Columbia
brigade; here accounts for the district were made up, and the dignitaries of the
company entertained. Gov. George Simpson had been at Fort Colville in the
summer before De Smet's visit, when Archibald Macdonald was the factor in
charge. This post was maintained some time after the Americans acquired the
Oregon Territory, but about 1857 it was removed north of the international boundary
line. In 1859 the United States government built a military post called Fort
Colville some miles east of the old fur-trading stockade, near the present town
of Colville, Washington. The neighboring Indians having become peaceful, the
fort is no longer garrisoned.       Ed.



[248] This affluent of the Bitterroot from the west was the one followed by the
Lewis and Clark expedition, in their route across the Bitterroot mountain divide.
Those explorers named it Traveller's Rest Creek; it is now known as the Lolo
Fork of the Bitterroot. An affluent of Missoula River, some distance further
down, has now taken the name that De Smet first applied to the Lolo Fork.       Ed.



[249] Hell Gate, for which see ante, p. 269, note 139.       Ed.



[250] The carcajou or wolverine (Gulo luscus).       Ed.



[251] The route usually taken by the Indians did not follow the main branch of
the river, but crossed the divide between the Missoula and Jocko rivers, coming
down into the valley of the Flathead, and proceeding along that to its outlet into
Clark's Fork. The two streams named for the saints were the main Flathead
and Jocko rivers, which unite in the prairie described by De Smet. There were a
number of small prairies in the vicinity, known as Camas from the abundance of
that root (Camas esculenta). The better-known Camas Prairie was twenty miles
below the mouth of the Jocko; the one mentioned by De Smet was apparently
higher up, near the divide of the two rivers. These should all be distinguished
from the Camas Prairie (Quamash Flats) of Lewis and Clark, which lay west of
the Bitterroot Mountains.       Ed.



[252] The Kalispel are the same tribe as the Pend d'Oreille, see ante, p. 141,
note 8.       Ed.



[253] During the day (as described in Chittenden and Richardson, De Smet, i,
p. 347), the father had passed Camas Prairie and advanced through Horse Plain
at the junction of Flathead and Clark's Fork.       Ed.



[254] Doubtless intended for oxide of iron.       Ed.



[255] In Explorations for a Pacific Railway, 1853-53 (Senate Ex. Docs., 35 Cong.,
2 sess., vol. xviii, p. 91) the valley is thus described: "The next sixty-five miles
along the valley of Clark's Fork is over a difficult trail, there being places where
the sharp rocks injured the animals;" again, "The valley is wide, arable, and
inviting for settlement, although rather heavily wooded."       Ed.



[256] Lake Pend d'Oreille, in Kootenai County, Idaho, is one of the most picturesque
bodies of fresh water in the Western states. It is irregular in shape, about
sixty miles long, and from three to fifteen in breadth, with a shore line of nearly
five hundred miles. It was probably, first of white men, visited by trappers and traders of the Hudson's Bay Company. It is now crossed by the Northern Pacific
Railway, and steamers ply upon its waters.       Ed.



[257] This is the Oregon cedar (Thuya gigantea), which attains great size and is
widely diffused on the trans-Rocky region.       Ed.



[258] The original French text of the letter describing this journey will be found
in Voyages aux Montagnes Rocheuses (Chittenden and Richardson, De Smet, i, pp.
354-358); it gives additional information regarding the remainder of the journey.
Having arrived at Lake Pend d'Oreille on November 1, the traveller was three
days passing the traverse; November 13 a high mountain was crossed, and
by pushing ahead, one more long day's journey brought him to Fort Colville,
where he was hospitably entertained by the Hudson's Bay factor. The return
journey was without incident.       Ed.



[259] Montmartre is the highest point in the city of Paris, three hundred and thirty
feet above the Seine, and dominates the entire city. In recent years a large church
has been built upon its summit.       Ed.



[260] Victor, hereditary chief of the Flatheads, succeeded Paul (or Big Face) in that office, which he retained with dignity and ability until his death in 1870, when
he was in turn succeeded by his son Charlot. He was a consistent friend of the
whites, many of the early pioneers of Montana testifying to his kindness and integrity.
His wife Agnes remembered the coming of Lewis and Clark to their
country; see O. D. Wheeler, On the Trail of Lewis and Clark (New York), ii,
p. 65.       Ed.



[261] For Horse Prairie (plain) see ante, p. 336, note 172. For the Kutenai see
Ross's Oregon Settlers, in our volume vii, p. 211, note 73. In addition, note that
the Kutenai (also called Skalzi) are a distinct linguistic stock, known as Kitunahan.
Their habitat was chiefly in British territory; but because of alliance with the
Flathead and other Salishan tribes they frequently wandered southward. A few
are still on the Flathead reservation in Montana; but about five hundred and fifty frequent the Kutenai agency in British Columbia. They are nearly all Catholics.       Ed.



[262] Flathead Lake is a broadening of the river of that name, and lies northeast
of the present Flathead reservation. It is about twenty-eight miles long, with
an average breadth of ten, and is studded with beautiful islands.       Ed.



[263] This hot spring is in the eastern part of the Flathead reservation, and by
a small creek discharges into the Little Bitterroot River, an affluent of the
Flathead.       Ed.



[264] For this lake see our volume vii, p. 211, note 75. Father de Smet crossed
the mountains from Missoula Valley by the route now followed by the Northern
Pacific Railway along the stream which he had christened St. Regis Borgia, through
St. Regis Pass, coming out upon the headwaters of C      ur d'Alène River, which
he followed to the lake of that name.       Ed.



[265] The mission founded by Father Point in November, 1842, known as the
Sacred Heart, was successful. The site was first upon St. Joseph River, a feeder
of C      ur d'Alène Lake; but in 1846 it was removed to C      ur d'Alène River, at the
present Cataldo. There the first church was built by the neophytes in 1853,
after designs by Father Ravalli; it is still a landmark of the region. The tribesmen
had been taught agriculture, and lived chiefly in log houses; but the soil
being sterile, the mission was again removed to the upper waters of Haugman's
Creek, in Idaho, where the C      ur d'Alène still reside upon their reservation.       Ed.



[266] Spokane River rises in C      ur d'Alène Lake and flows almost directly to
the Falls, thence northwest to its embouchment into the Columbia. It is about
two hundred feet wide at the mouth and throughout its entire length is broken
by falls and rapids, furnishing water power of great value, its total decline being
a hundred and thirty feet. An early fur-trade fort known as Spokane Post stood
near the present city of that name, but about 1824 was abandoned for Colville.
See Franchère's Narrative, in our volume vi, p. 277, note 85.       Ed.



[267] Father de Smet here refers to the cliffs and rapids on Clark's Fork, about
fifteen miles above Lake Pend d'Oreille; they are still known as "The Cabinets."
The water rushes through a gorge, between cliffs over a hundred feet high.       Ed.



[268] This mission was located at the mouth of Chamokane (Tskimakain) Creek,
on what is known as Walker's Prairie about forty miles northwest of Spokane,
and the borders of the present Spokane reservation. It was a station of the American
Commissioners founded March 20, 1839, by two missionaries who had visited
the spot the previous autumn and erected log-huts on the site.


Rev. Elkanah Walker was born in Maine in 1805. Educated at Bangor Theological
Seminary he had first intended to go as a missionary to Africa; but recruits
being needed for the Oregon mission, he volunteered, and in 1838 came out with
his wife, Mary Richardson Walker. They labored among the Spokan with
considerable success       in 1841 printing a primer in that language       until the
Whitman massacre (1847). Their Indians requested them to stay and promised
them protection; but the government sent a military escort to take them to the
settlements. There Walker bought land at Forest Grove, in the Willamette
Valley, where he died in 1877.


Rev. Cushing Eells was born in Massachusetts in 1810. Graduated at Williams
College, he married Myra Fairbank in the spring of 1838, and with her left
immediately for the Oregon mission. Living to old age, the pioneer missionary
was known throughout the West, his character revered by all. He gave over fifty years of his life to missionary service, in his later years being known as Father
Eells. He was instrumental in founding both Pacific University and Whitman
College, and travelled extensively in the work of building churches and preaching.
He frequently re-visited his Spokan protégés, the larger portion of whom are now
members of the Presbyterian church.       Ed.



[269] For Rev. Samuel Parker see Townsend's Narrative, in our volume xxi,
p. 335, note 112. Parker thus describes this incident in his Journal of an Exploring
Tour beyond the Rocky Mountains (Ithaca, N. Y., 1838), pp. 275, 276: "One
grave in the same village had a cross standing over it, which was the only relic
of the kind I saw, together with this just named, during my travels in this country.
But as I viewed the cross of wood made by men's hands of no avail, to benefit
either the dead or the living, and far more likely to operate as a salvo to a guilty
conscience, or a stepping-stone to idolatry, than to be understood in its spiritual
sense to refer to a crucifixion of our sins, I took this, which the Indians had prepared,
and broke it to pieces. I then told them we place a stone at the head and
foot of the grave only to mark the place; and without a murmur they cheerfully
acquiesced, and adopted our custom."       Ed.



[270] Modeste Demers was born near Quebec in 1808; educated at Quebec Seminary
he was ordained in 1836, and the same year started for Red River. Thence
he went overland with the Hudson's Bay brigade in 1838, arriving in Vancouver
in the autumn of that year with Father Blanchet. In 1839 he visited New Caledonia,
and in 1842 was detailed to found missions among the tribesmen, and to
instruct the half-breeds at the forts. He labored chiefly in New Caledonia until
1847, then being consecrated bishop of Vancouver. He continued in this field
of labor until his death at Victoria in 1871.       Ed.



[271] The Okinagan Indians are of the Salishan family, although some authorities
class them with the Shushwaps of British Columbia. They formed a considerable
confederacy of allied tribes, extending along the river valley of their name, and
including the bands of the Similkameen River. A trading post was early erected
among them, for which see Franchère's Narrative, in our volume vi, p. 260, note 71.
Alexander Ross, who married an Okinagan woman, and lived among them for
many years, is the chief authority upon their manners and customs. See Ross's
Oregon Settlers, in our volume vii, chapters xviii to xxi. The Okinagan are now
tributary to Colville agency, and number about five hundred and fifty, most of
whom are Catholics.       Ed.



[272] The country between Fort Colville and Okanagan has been but imperfectly
charted. It is about sixty miles in a direct line through the Colville Indian reservation.       Ed.



[273] A small lake called Karamip is found on modern maps near the head of
Sanpoil River.       Ed.



[274] Lake Okanagan in British Columbia is about sixty miles in length and
the source of the river of that name. It would be a long and difficult journey to
return thence to Fort Colville in three days; so that De Smet's rendezvous with the Indians was possibly at some smaller interior lake, entitled by him Lake
Okanagan because he met that tribe upon its shores.       Ed.



[275] The C      ur d'Alène.       Ed.



[276] See Thomas W. Symons, "Report of an Examination of the Upper Columbia
River," Senate Ex. Docs., 47 Cong., 1 sess., No. 186.       Ed.



[277] See brief biographical sketch of Ogden in Townsend's Narrative, our volume
xxi, p. 314, note 99.       Ed.



[278] For detailed descriptions of the Great Dalles of the Columbia, see Original
Journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, iii, pp. 151-159; Franchère's
Narrative, in our volume vi, p. 337; and Ross's Oregon Settlers, our volume
vii, pp. 130, 131       Ed.



[279] What are technically known as the Little Dalles of the Columbia lie above
Fort Colville. The description would appear to apply to the present Whirlpool
Rapids, just below Kalichen Falls, about twenty miles above Okanagan River.
The entire stretch from the Nespelin River west, is a long series of difficult rapids
and riffles. See "Report" cited ante, p. 373, note 195.       Ed.



[280] For Fort Walla Walla, a Hudson's Bay post, see Townsend's Narrative,
in our volume xxi, p. 278, note 73.       Ed.



[281] Of these Indian tribes the Chaudière, Okinagan, Sanpoil (Cingpoils), have
been described ante, in notes 162, 190, 161; for the Walla Walla and Cayuse
see our volume vii, p. 137, note 37; for the Nez Percés (Pierced Noses), volume
vi, p. 340, note 145; for the Indians of the Dalles, volume vii, p. 129, note 31; the
Chinook (Schinooks), volume vi, p. 240, note 40; for Clatsop (Classops), volume
vi, p. 239, note 39. The Attayes were probably the Yakima, an important
Shahaptian tribe in the valley of that river; one branch of the tribe was called
Atanum, and a Catholic mission by that name was in later years established
among them.       Ed.



[282] Part of the Great Plain of the Columbia, broken by many fantastic shapes
of the volcanic underlying rock. Most notable of these is the Grand Coulée,
which, however, De Smet did not cross, for it lies north of Spokane River. He
probably took the trail afterwards developed into a part of the Mullan road, from
Great Falls of Missouri to Walla Walla. From the land of the C      ur d'Alène he
returned along the route by which he had come out       the St. Regis Pass and
river St. Regis Borgia.       Ed.



[283] This was the route followed by Clark on his return journey in 1806       through
Gibbon's Pass, and down the upper waters of Big Hole (or Wisdom)
River, an affluent of the Jefferson.       Ed.



[284] It was not the policy of the Hudson's Bay Company to encourage settlements.
Dr. McLoughlin, however, permitted some of the retired servants of the
company to settle at French Prairie (or Chemayway) in the Willamette Valley.
There, by 1830, a considerable group of farmers were found, mostly of French-Canadian
origin. Among the earliest settlers were Louis Labonte, Etienne Lucier,
and Joseph Gervais.


Fort Nisqually, on Puget Sound, four miles northeast of the mouth of Nisqually
River, was founded in 1833 as a fur-trading post. In 1838 the Puget Sound
Agricultural Company was formed in London, most of its members being Hudson's
Bay Company men, in order to exploit the region of the sound; consequently
a considerable settlement grew up near the fort.


In 1837 Simon Plomondeau was advised by Dr. McLoughlin to settle on Cowlitz
Prairie, in the valley of the river of that name. Soon one Faincaut settled
near him. In 1839 a large farm was surveyed by Charles Ross, John Work, and
James Douglas as a company settlement. It grew but little until the advent of
Americans in 1853-54.       Ed.



[285] For the Kalapuya see our volume vii, p. 230, note 80.       Ed.



[286] The Cowlitz were a numerous and powerful tribe of Salishan stock, in
the valley of the river of that name. They have now lost their tribal identity,
the remnant (there were about a hundred and twenty-five in 1882) having lands
allotted in severalty.


For the Klikatat, see Townsend's Narrative, in our volume xxi, p. 302, note 88.
On their later history it may be noted that they participated in the Yakima treaty
of 1855, and are now one of the consolidated tribes on Yakima reservation; a few,
however, maintaining themselves on White Salmon River.       Ed.



[287] For the Chehalis consult our volume vi, p. 256, note 65.


The Nisqualli are a Salishan tribe on and in the vicinity of Nisqually River.
There are now but about a hundred and fifty of this tribe surviving on the Puyallup
reservation, Washington.       Ed.



[288] The Skallam (Clallam), a tribe of Salishan origin, were first met by whites
along Admiralty Inlet. There are now about seven hundred and fifty of these
Indians extant, having allotments in severalty both at Jamestown and Port
Gamble.       Ed.



[289] Methodist missions in Oregon were founded by Rev. Jason Lee, for whom
see Townsend's Narrative, in our volume xxi, p. 138, note 13. The establishment
in the Willamette Valley was the central one, and consisted largely of an agricultural
settlement with a school for Indian children, that afterwards developed into
Willamette University. It was situated about eighteen miles above Champoeg,
not far from Salem. The second station at Clatsop (not Klatraps) Plains, south
of Point Adams, was founded by J. H. Frost, accompanied by Solomon Smith
and Calvin Tibbits, who had married Clatsop women. The families removed
to this point in February, 1841. Two years later Frost returned to the
United States, and J. L. Parrish took up the work. Little attempt was made
at this point to reach the Indians. The mission at Nisqually was begun in
1839. The following year, J. P. Richmond was stationed here; he returned home after two years, whereupon the Nisqually mission was abandoned. The Indian
mission at the Dalles was begun in March, 1838, by Daniel Lee and H. K. W. Perkins.
It was conducted with varying success until 1845, when the property
was disposed of to the Presbyterians. The settlement at Willamette Falls, made
in 1840 by A. F. Waller, was chiefly a colonizing experiment. In 1844 there were
forty Methodists at this place.       Ed.



[290] Father Blanchet here refers to the missions of Dr. Whitman at Waiilatpu
for the Cayuse, and that of H. H. Spaulding at Lapwai for the Nez Percés. See
Townsend's Narrative, in our volume xxi, p. 352, note 125.       Ed.



[291] Perkins at the Dalles mission (see ante, note 208) had attempted to reach
the Indians gathered at the Cascades. But Blanchet gained more influence
over these nations than the Protestant missionary, for the natives were better
pleased with the Catholic ceremonials.       Ed.



[292] Probably intended for Clackamas, the name of a tribe upon the river of the
same designation, which empties into the Willamette at the Falls.


A. F. Waller came to reinforce the Methodist mission in 1840, and was sent
to Willamette Falls. He had a legal controversy with Dr. McLoughlin in relation
to the title to land at this place. Waller became a citizen of Oregon, acquired
considerable property, and died in Willamette Valley in 1872.       Ed.



[293] A long struggle had occurred to secure the entrance of Catholic missionaries
to the Hawaiian Islands. The first priests, who came out in 1827, were soon
expelled. Returning in 1836, after a long struggle all were obliged to depart
save Robert Walsh, an Irish priest, who was permitted to remain, provided he
would agree not to teach the natives. In 1839 a French man-of-war threatened
the government with a bombardment and succeeded in wresting from them the
promise of toleration for Catholics; thereupon Etienne Rouchouse (Chochure),
bishop of Nilopolis, arrived in May, 1838, accompanied by two priests. The
next year the bishop returned to France for reinforcements; when on the
outward voyage the vessel foundered off Cape Horn, all on board perishing.       Ed.



[294] In 1818 J. N. Provencher was dispatched from Quebec to minister to the
Red River settlers, and established a station at St. Boniface. In 1822, he was consecrated bishop of Juliopolis, and remained at St. Boniface until his death in
1853. His jurisdiction included Rupert's Land and all the Northwest provinces,
whither he sent out many missionaries during his long episcopate.       Ed.



[295] Passing from Madison to Gallatin rivers, crossing the divide that separates
them, and then from Gallatin to the Yellowstone, probably by way of Bozeman's
Pass, the nearest and most frequented route. This would bring the travellers
out upon the Yellowstone at about the present Livingston, Montana.       Ed.



[296] One of the proprietors was Pierre Chouteau, whom Father de Smet had
doubtless known in St. Louis. Larpenteur relates this meeting (Coues, Larpenteur's
Journal, i, p. 174), and states that the opposition of a new firm had brought
the American Fur Company partners to the upper river to concert plans.       Ed.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
