      TO FRANCIS BARTLETT
    
    
       
    
    
      THESE miscellaneous notes and essays are called Ponkapog Papers not
      simply because they chanced, for the most part, to be written within the
      limits of the old Indian Reservation, but, rather, because there is
      something typical of their unpretentiousness in the modesty with which
      Ponkapog assumes to being even a village. The little Massachusetts
      settlement, nestled under the wing of the Blue Hills, has no illusions
      concerning itself, never mistakes the cackle of the bourg for the sound
      that echoes round the world, and no more thinks of rivalling great centres
      of human activity than these slight papers dream of inviting comparison
      between themselves and important pieces of literature. Therefore there
      seems something especially appropriate in the geographical title selected,
      and if the author's choice of name need further excuse, it is to be found
      in the alluring alliteration lying ready at his hand.

      IN his Memoirs, Kropotkin states the singular fact that the natives of the
      Malayan Archipelago have an idea that something is extracted from them
      when their likenesses are taken by photography. Here is the motive for a
      fantastic short story, in which the hero&mdash;an author in vogue or a
      popular actor&mdash;might be depicted as having all his good qualities
      gradually photographed out of him. This could well be the result of too
      prolonged indulgence in the effort to "look natural." First the man loses
      his charming simplicity; then he begins to pose in intellectual attitudes,
      with finger on brow; then he becomes morbidly self-conscious, and finally
      ends in an asylum for incurable egotists. His death might be brought about
      by a cold caught in going out bareheaded, there being, for the moment, no
      hat in the market of sufficient circumference to meet his enlarged
      requirement.
    
    
      THE evening we dropped anchor in the Bay of Yedo the moon was hanging
      directly over Yokohama. It was a mother-of-pearl moon, and might have been
      manufactured by any of the delicate artisans in the Hanchodori quarter. It
      impressed one as being a very good imitation, but nothing more. Nammikawa,
      the cloisonne-worker at Tokio, could have made a better moon.
    
    
      I NOTICE the announcement of a new edition of "The Two First Centuries of
      Florentine Literature," by Professor Pasquale Villari. I am not acquainted
      with the work in question, but I trust that Professor Villari makes it
      plain to the reader how both centuries happened to be first.
    
    
      THE walking delegates of a higher civilization, who have nothing to
      divide, look upon the notion of property as a purely artificial creation
      of human society. According to these advanced philosophers, the time will
      come when no man shall be allowed to call anything his. The beneficent law
      which takes away an author's rights in his own books just at the period
      when old age is creeping upon him seems to me a handsome stride toward the
      longed-for millennium.
    
    
      SAVE US from our friends&mdash;our enemies we can guard against. The
      well-meaning rector of the little parish of Woodgates, England, and
      several of Robert Browning's local admirers have recently busied
      themselves in erecting a tablet to the memory of "the first known
      forefather of the poet." This lately turned up ancestor, who does not date
      very far back, was also named Robert Browning, and is described on the
      mural marble as "formerly footman and butler to Sir John Bankes of Corfe
      Castle." Now, Robert Browning the poet had as good right as Abou Ben Adhem
      himself to ask to be placed on the list of those who love their fellow
      men; but if the poet could have been consulted in the matter he probably
      would have preferred not to have that particular footman exhumed. However,
      it is an ill wind that blows nobody good. Sir John Bankes would scarcely
      have been heard of in our young century if it had not been for his
      footman. As Robert stood day by day, sleek and solemn, behind his master's
      chair in Corfe Castle, how little it entered into the head of Sir John
      that his highly respectable name would be served up to posterity&mdash;like
      a cold relish&mdash;by his own butler! By Robert!
    
    
      IN the east-side slums of New York, somewhere in the picturesque Bowery
      district, stretches a malodorous little street wholly given over to
      long-bearded, bird-beaked merchants of ready-made and second-hand
      clothing. The contents of the dingy shops seem to have revolted, and
      rushed pell-mell out of doors, and taken possession of the sidewalk. One
      could fancy that the rebellion had been quelled at this point, and that
      those ghastly rows of complete suits strung up on either side of the
      doorways were the bodies of the seditious ringleaders. But as you approach
      these limp figures, each dangling and gyrating on its cord in a most
      suggestive fashion, you notice, pinned to the lapel of a coat here and
      there, a strip of paper announcing the very low price at which you may
      become the happy possessor. That dissipates the illusion.
    
    
      POLONIUS, in the play, gets killed&mdash;and not any too soon. If it only
      were practicable to kill him in real life! A story&mdash;to be called The
      Passing of Polonius&mdash;in which a king issues a decree condemning to
      death every long-winded, didactic person in the kingdom, irrespective of
      rank, and is himself instantly arrested and decapitated. The man who
      suspects his own tediousness is yet to be born.
    
    
      WHENEVER I take up Emerson's poems I find myself turning automatically to
      his Bacchus. Elsewhere, in detachable passages embedded in mediocre verse,
      he rises for a moment to heights not reached by any other of our poets;
      but Bacchus is in the grand style throughout. Its texture can bear
      comparison with the world's best in this kind. In imaginative quality and
      austere richness of diction what other verse of our period approaches it?
      The day Emerson wrote Bacchus he had in him, as Michael Drayton said of
      Marlowe, "those brave translunary things that the first poets had."
    
    
      IMAGINE all human beings swept off the face of the earth, excepting one
      man. Imagine this man in some vast city, New York or London. Imagine him
      on the third or fourth day of his solitude sitting in a house and hearing
      a ring at the door-bell!
    
    
      No man has ever yet succeeded in painting an honest portrait of himself in
      an autobiography, however sedulously he may have set to work about it. In
      spite of his candid purpose he omits necessary touches and adds
      superfluous ones. At times he cannot help draping his thought, and the
      least shred of drapery becomes a disguise. It is only the diarist who
      accomplishes the feat of self-portraiture, and he, without any such end in
      view, does it unconsciously. A man cannot keep a daily record of his
      comings and goings and the little items that make up the sum of his life,
      and not inadvertently betray himself at every turn. He lays bare his heart
      with a candor not possible to the selfconsciousness that inevitably colors
      premeditated revelation. While Pepys was filling those small octavo pages
      with his perplexing cipher he never once suspected that he was adding a
      photographic portrait of himself to the world's gallery of immortals. We
      are more intimately acquainted with Mr. Samuel Pepys, the inner man&mdash;his
      little meannesses and his large generosities&mdash;then we are with half
      the persons we call our dear friends.
    
    
      THE young girl in my story is to be as sensitive to praise as a prism is
      to light. Whenever anybody praises her she breaks into colors.
    
    
      IN the process of dusting my study, the other morning, the maid replaced
      an engraving of Philip II. of Spain up-side down on the mantel-shelf, and
      his majesty has remained in that undignified posture ever since. I have no
      disposition to come to his aid. My abhorrence of the wretch is as hearty
      as if he had not been dead and&mdash;otherwise provided for these last
      three hundred years. Bloody Mary of England was nearly as merciless, but
      she was sincere and uncompromising in her extirpation of heretics.
    
    
      Philip II., whose one recorded hearty laugh was occasioned by the news of
      the St. Bartholomew massacre, could mask his fanaticism or drop it for the
      time being, when it seemed politic to do so. Queen Mary was a maniac; but
      the successor of Torquemada was the incarnation of cruelty pure and
      simple, and I have a mind to let my counterfeit presentment of him stand
      on its head for the rest of its natural life. I cordially dislike several
      persons, but I hate nobody, living or dead, excepting Philip II. of Spain.
      He appears to give me as much trouble as Charles I. gave the amiable Mr.
      Dick.
    
    
      AMONG the delightful men and women whom you are certain to meet at an
      English country house there is generally one guest who is supposed to be
      preternaturally clever and amusing&mdash;"so very droll, don't you know."
      He recites things, tells stories in costermonger dialect, and mimics
      public characters. He is a type of a class, and I take him to be one of
      the elementary forms of animal life, like the acalephae. His presence is
      capable of adding a gloom to an undertaker's establishment. The last time
      I fell in with him was on a coaching trip through Devon, and in spite of
      what I have said I must confess to receiving an instant of entertainment
      at his hands. He was delivering a little dissertation on "the English and
      American languages." As there were two Americans on the back seat&mdash;it
      seems we term ourselves "Amurricans"&mdash;his choice of subject was full
      of tact. It was exhilarating to get a lesson in pronunciation from a
      gentleman who said boult for bolt, called St. John Sin' Jun,
      and did not know how to pronounce the beautiful name of his own college at
      Oxford. Fancy a perfectly sober man saying Maudlin for Magdalen!
      Perhaps the purest English spoken is that of the English folk who have
      resided abroad ever since the Elizabethan period, or thereabouts.
    
    
      EVERY one has a bookplate these days, and the collectors are after it. The
      fool and his bookplate are soon parted. To distribute one's ex libris
      is inanely to destroy the only significance it has, that of indicating the
      past or present ownership of the volume in which it is placed.
    
    
      WHEN an Englishman is not highly imaginative he is apt to be the most
      matter-of-fact of mortals. He is rarely imaginative, and seldom has an
      alert sense of humor. Yet England has produced the finest of humorists and
      the greatest of poets. The humor and imagination which are diffused
      through other peoples concentrate themselves from time to time in
      individual Englishmen.
    
    
      THIS is a page of autobiography, though not written in the first person:
      Many years ago a noted Boston publisher used to keep a large
      memorandum-book on a table in his personal office. The volume always lay
      open, and was in no manner a private affair, being the receptacle of
      nothing more important than hastily scrawled reminders to attend to this
      thing or the other. It chanced one day that a very young, unfledged
      author, passing through the city, looked in upon the publisher, who was
      also the editor of a famous magazine. The unfledged had a copy of verses
      secreted about his person. The publisher was absent, and young Milton,
      feeling that "they also serve who only stand and wait," sat down and
      waited. Presently his eye fell upon the memorandum-book, lying there
      spread out like a morning newspaper, and almost in spite of himself he
      read: "Don't forget to see the binder," "Don't forget to mail E&mdash;&mdash;-
      his contract," "Don't forget H&mdash;&mdash;-'s proofs," etc. An
      inspiration seized upon the youth; he took a pencil, and at the tail of
      this long list of "don't forgets" he wrote: "Don't forget to accept A 's
      poem." He left his manuscript on the table and disappeared. That afternoon
      when the publisher glanced over his memoranda, he was not a little
      astonished at the last item; but his sense of humor was so strong that he
      did accept the poem (it required a strong sense of humor to do that), and
      sent the lad a check for it, though the verses remain to this day
      unprinted. That kindly publisher was wise as well as kind.
    
    
      FRENCH novels with metaphysical or psychological prefaces are always
      certain to be particularly indecent.
    
    
      I HAVE lately discovered that Master Harry Sandford of England, the
      priggish little boy in the story of "Sandford and Merton," has a worthy
      American cousin in one Elsie Dinsmore, who sedately pirouettes through a
      seemingly endless succession of girls' books. I came across a nest of
      fifteen of them the other day. This impossible female is carried from
      infancy up to grandmotherhood, and is, I believe, still leisurely pursuing
      her way down to the tomb in an ecstatic state of uninterrupted
      didacticism. There are twenty-five volumes of her and the granddaughter,
      who is also christened Elsie, and is her grandmother's own child, with the
      same precocious readiness to dispense ethical instruction to her elders.
      An interesting instance of hereditary talent!
    
    
      H&mdash;&mdash;-'s intellect resembles a bamboo&mdash;slender, graceful,
      and hollow. Personally, he is long and narrow, and looks as if he might
      have been the product of a rope-walk. He is loosely put together, like an
      ill-constructed sentence, and affects me like one. His figure is
      ungrammatical.
    
    
      AMERICAN humor is nearly as ephemeral as the flowers that bloom in the
      spring. Each generation has its own crop, and, as a rule, insists on
      cultivating a new kind. That of 1860, if it were to break into blossom at
      the present moment, would probably be left to fade upon the stem.
    
    
      Humor is a delicate shrub, with the passing hectic flush of its time. The
      current-topic variety is especially subject to very early frosts, as is
      also the dialectic species. Mark Twain's humor is not to be classed with
      the fragile plants; it has a serious root striking deep down into rich
      earth, and I think it will go on flowering indefinitely.
    
    
      I HAVE been imagining an ideal critical journal, whose plan should involve
      the discharge of the chief literary critic and the installment of a fresh
      censor on the completion of each issue. To place a man in permanent
      absolute control of a certain number of pages, in which to express his
      opinions, is to place him in a position of great personal danger, It is
      almost inevitable that he should come to overrate the importance of those
      opinions, to take himself with far too much seriousness, and in the end
      adopt the dogma of his own infallibility. The liberty to summon this or
      that man-of-letters to a supposititious bar of justice is apt to beget in
      the self-appointed judge an exaggerated sense of superiority. He becomes
      impatient of any rulings not his, and says in effect, if not in so many
      words: "I am Sir Oracle, and when I ope my lips let no dog bark." When the
      critic reaches this exalted frame of mind his slight usefulness is gone.
    
    
      AFTER a debauch of thunder-shower, the weather takes the pledge and signs
      it with a rainbow.
    
    
      I LIKE to have a thing suggested rather than told in full. When every
      detail is given, the mind rests satisfied, and the imagination loses the
      desire to use its own wings. The partly draped statue has a charm which
      the nude lacks. Who would have those marble folds slip from the raised
      knee of the Venus of Melos? Hawthorne knew how to make his lovely thought
      lovelier by sometimes half veiling it.
    
    
      I HAVE just tested the nib of a new pen on a slight fancy which Herrick
      has handled twice in the "Hesperides." The fancy, however, is not
      Herrick's; it is as old as poetry and the exaggeration of lovers, and I
      have the same privilege as another to try my fortune with it:
    
    
      UP ROOS THE SONNE, AND UP ROOS EMELYE CHAUCER
    
    
      When some hand has partly drawn The cloudy curtains of her bed, And my
      lady's golden head Glimmers in the dusk like dawn, Then methinks is day
      begun. Later, when her dream has ceased And she softly stirs and wakes,
      Then it is as when the East A sudden rosy magic takes From the
      cloud-enfolded sun, And full day breaks!
    
    
      Shakespeare, who has done so much to discourage literature by anticipating
      everybody, puts the whole matter into a nutshell:
    
    
      But soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and
      Juliet is the sun.
    
    
      THERE is a phrase spoken by Hamlet which I have seen quoted innumerable
      times, and never once correctly. Hamlet, addressing Horatio, says:
    
    
      Give me that man That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him In my
      heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart.
    
    
      The words italicized are invariably written "heart of hearts"&mdash;as if
      a person possessed that organ in duplicate. Perhaps no one living, with
      the exception of Sir Henry Irving, is more familiar with the play of
      Hamlet than my good friend Mr. Bram Stoker, who makes his heart plural on
      two occasions in his recent novel, "The Mystery of the Sea." Mrs. Humphry
      Ward also twice misquotes the passage in "Lady Rose's Daughter."
    
    
      BOOKS that have become classics&mdash;books that ave had their day and now
      get more praise than perusal&mdash;always remind me of venerable colonels
      and majors and captains who, having reached the age limit, find themselves
      retired upon half pay.
    
    
      WHETHER or not the fretful porcupine rolls itself into a ball is a subject
      over which my friend John Burroughs and several brother naturalists have
      lately become as heated as if the question involved points of theology. Up
      among the Adirondacks, and in the very heart of the region of porcupines,
      I happen to have a modest cottage. This retreat is called The Porcupine,
      and I ought by good rights to know something about the habits of the small
      animal from which it derives its name. Last winter my dog Buster used to
      return home on an average of three times a month from an excursion up Mt.
      Pisgah with his nose stuck full of quills, and he ought to have
      some concrete ideas on the subject. We two, then, are prepared to testify
      that the porcupine in its moments of relaxation occasionally contracts
      itself into what might be taken for a ball by persons not too difficult to
      please in the matter of spheres. But neither Buster nor I&mdash;being
      unwilling to get into trouble&mdash;would like to assert that it is an
      actual ball. That it is a shape with which one had better not
      thoughtlessly meddle is a conviction that my friend Buster stands ready to
      defend against all comers.
    
    
      WORDSWORTH'S characterization of the woman in one of his poems as "a
      creature not too bright or good for human nature's daily food" has always
      appeared to me too cannibalesque to be poetical. It directly sets one to
      thinking of the South Sea islanders.
    
    
      THOUGH Iago was not exactly the kind of person one would select as a
      superintendent for a Sunday-school, his advice to young Roderigo was
      wisdom itself&mdash;"Put money in thy purse." Whoever disparages money
      disparages every step in the progress of the human race. I listened the
      other day to a sermon in which gold was personified as a sort of
      glittering devil tempting mortals to their ruin. I had an instant of
      natural hesitation when the contribution-plate was passed around
      immediately afterward. Personally, I believe that the possession of gold
      has ruined fewer men than the lack of it. What noble enterprises have been
      checked and what fine souls have been blighted in the gloom of poverty the
      world will never know. "After the love of knowledge," says Buckle, "there
      is no one passion which has done so much good to mankind as the love of
      money."
    
    
      DIALECT tempered with slang is an admirable medium of communication
      between persons who have nothing to say and persons who would not care for
      anything properly said.
    
    
      DR. HOLMES had an odd liking for ingenious desk-accessories in the way of
      pencil-sharpeners, paper-weights, penholders, etc. The latest contrivances
      in this fashion&mdash;probably dropped down to him by the inventor angling
      for a nibble of commendation&mdash;were always making one another's
      acquaintance on his study table. He once said to me: "I 'm waiting for
      somebody to invent a mucilage-brush that you can't by any accident put
      into your inkstand. It would save me frequent moments of humiliation."
    
    
      THE deceptive Mr. False and the volatile Mrs. Giddy, who figure in the
      pages of seventeenth and eighteenth century fiction, are not tolerated in
      modern novels and plays. Steal the burglar and Palette the artist have
      ceased to be. A name indicating the quality or occupation of the bearer
      strikes us as a too transparent device. Yet there are such names in
      contemporary real life. That of our worthy Adjutant-General Drum may be
      instanced. Neal and Pray are a pair of deacons who linger in the memory of
      my boyhood. Sweet the confectioner and Lamb the butcher are individuals
      with whom I have had dealings. The old-time sign of Ketchum &amp; Cheetam,
      Brokers, in Wall Street, New York, seems almost too good to be true. But
      it was once, if it is not now, an actuality.
    
    
      I HAVE observed that whenever a Boston author dies, New York immediately
      becomes a great literary centre.
    
    
      THE possession of unlimited power will make a despot of almost any man.
      There is a possible Nero in the gentlest human creature that walks.
    
    
      EVERY living author has a projection of himself, a sort of eidolon, that
      goes about in near and remote places making friends or enemies for him
      among persons who never lay eyes upon the writer in the flesh. When he
      dies, this phantasmal personality fades away, and the author lives only in
      the impression created by his own literature. It is only then that the
      world begins to perceive what manner of man the poet, the novelist, or the
      historian really was. Not until he is dead, and perhaps some long time
      dead, is it possible for the public to take his exact measure. Up to that
      point contemporary criticism has either overrated him or underrated him,
      or ignored him altogether, having been misled by the eidolon, which always
      plays fantastic tricks with the writer temporarily under its dominion. It
      invariably represents him as either a greater or a smaller personage than
      he actually is. Presently the simulacrum works no more spells, good or
      evil, and the deception is unveiled. The hitherto disregarded author is
      recognized, and the idol of yesterday, which seemed so important, is taken
      down from his too large pedestal and carted off to the dumping-ground of
      inadequate things. To be sure, if he chances to have been not entirely
      unworthy, and on cool examination is found to possess some appreciable
      degree of merit, then he is set up on a new slab of appropriate
      dimensions. The late colossal statue shrinks to a modest bas-relief. On
      the other hand, some scarcely noticed bust may suddenly become a revered
      full-length figure. Between the reputation of the author living and the
      reputation of the same author dead there is ever a wide discrepancy.
    
    
      A NOT too enchanting glimpse of Tennyson is incidentally given by Charles
      Brookfield, the English actor, in his "Random Recollections." Mr.
      Brookfield's father was, on one occasion, dining at the Oxford and
      Cambridge Club with George Venables, Frank Lushington, Alfred Tennyson,
      and others. "After dinner," relates the random recollector, "the poet
      insisted upon putting his feet on the table, tilting back his chair more
      Americano. There were strangers in the room, and he was expostulated
      with for his uncouthness, but in vain. 'Do put down your feet!' pleaded
      his host. 'Why should I?' retorted Tennyson. 'I 'm very comfortable as I
      am.' 'Every one's staring at you,' said another. 'Let 'em stare,' replied
      the poet, placidly. 'Alfred,' said my father, 'people will think you're
      Longfellow.' Down went the feet." That more Americano of Brookfield
      the younger is delicious with its fine insular flavor, but the holding up
      of Longfellow&mdash;the soul of gentleness, the prince of courtesy&mdash;as
      a bugaboo of bad manners is simply inimitable. It will take England years
      and years to detect the full unconscious humor of it.
    
    
      GREAT orators who are not also great writers become very indistinct
      historical shadows to the generations immediately following them. The
      spell vanishes with the voice. A man's voice is almost the only part of
      him entirely obliterated by death. The violet of his native land may be
      made of his ashes, but nature in her economy seems to have taken no care
      of his intonations, unless she perpetuates them in restless waves of air
      surging about the poles. The well-graced actor who leaves no perceptible
      record of his genius has a decided advantage over the mere orator. The
      tradition of the player's method and presence is associated with works of
      enduring beauty. Turning to the pages of the dramatist, we can picture to
      ourselves the greatness of Garrick or Siddons in this or that scene, in
      this or that character. It is not so easy to conjure up the impassioned
      orator from the pages of a dry and possibly illogical argument in favor of
      or against some long-ago-exploded measure of government. The laurels of an
      orator who is not a master of literary art wither quickly.
    
    
      ALL the best sands of my life are somehow getting into the wrong end of
      the hour-glass. If I could only reverse it! Were it in my power to do so,
      would I?
    
    
      SHAKESPEARE is forever coming into our affairs&mdash;putting in his oar,
      so to speak&mdash;with some pat word or sentence. The conversation, the
      other evening, had turned on the subject of watches, when one of the
      gentlemen present, the manager of a large watch-making establishment, told
      us a rather interesting fact. The component parts of a watch are produced
      by different workmen, who have no concern with the complex piece of
      mechanism as a whole, and possibly, as a rule, understand it imperfectly.
      Each worker needs to be expert in only his own special branch. When the
      watch has reached a certain advanced state, the work requires a touch as
      delicate and firm as that of an oculist performing an operation. Here the
      most skilled and trustworthy artisans are employed; they receive high
      wages, and have the benefit of a singular indulgence. In case the workman,
      through too continuous application, finds himself lacking the steadiness
      of nerve demanded by his task, he is allowed without forfeiture of pay to
      remain idle temporarily, in order that his hand may recover the requisite
      precision of touch. As I listened, Hamlet's courtly criticism of the
      grave-digger's want of sensibility came drifting into my memory. "The hand
      of little employment hath the daintier sense," says Shakespeare, who has
      left nothing unsaid.
    
    
      IT was a festival in honor of Dai Butsu or some one of the auxiliary
      deities that preside over the destinies of Japland. For three days and
      nights the streets of Tokio&mdash;where the squat little brown houses look
      for all the world as if they were mimicking the favorite sitting posture
      of the Japanese&mdash;were crowded with smiling holiday makers, and made
      gay with devices of tinted tissue paper, dolphins, devils, dragons, and
      mythical winged creatures which at night amiably turned themselves into
      lanterns. Garlands of these, arranged close together, were stretched
      across the streets from ridgepoles to ridgepole, and your jinrikisha
      whisked you through interminable arbors of soft illumination. The
      spectacle gave one an idea of fairyland, but then all Japan does that.
    

     A land not like ours, that land of strange flowers,
     Of daemons and spooks with mysterious powers&mdash;
     Of gods who breathe ice, who cause peach-blooms and rice
     And manage the moonshine and turn on the showers.

     Each day has its fair or its festival there,
     And life seems immune to all trouble and care&mdash;
     Perhaps only seems, in that island of dreams,
     Sea-girdled and basking in magical air.

     They've streets of bazaars filled with lacquers and jars,
     And silk stuffs, and sword-blades that tell of old wars;
     They've Fuji's white cone looming up, bleak and lone,
     As if it were trying to reach to the stars.

     They've temples and gongs, and grim Buddhas in throngs,
     And pearl-powdered geisha with dances and songs:
     Each girl at her back has an imp, brown or black,
     And dresses her hair in remarkable prongs.

     On roadside and street toddling images meet,
     And smirk and kotow in a way that is sweet;
     Their obis are tied with particular pride,
     Their silken kimonos hang scant to the feet.

     With purrs like a cat they all giggle and chat,
     Now spreading their fans, and now holding them flat;
     A fan by its play whispers, "Go now!" or "Stay!"
     "I hate you!"  "I love you!"&mdash;a fan can say that!
     Beneath a dwarf tree, here and there, two or three
     Squat coolies are sipping small cups of green tea;
     They sputter, and leer, and cry out, and appear
     Like bad little chessmen gone off on a spree.

     At night&mdash;ah, at night the long streets are a sight,
     With garlands of soft-colored lanterns alight&mdash;
     Blue, yellow, and red twinkling high overhead,
     Like thousands of butterflies taking their flight.

     Somewhere in the gloom that no lanterns illume
     Stand groups of slim lilies and jonquils in bloom;
     On tiptoe, unseen 'mid a tangle of green,
     They offer the midnight their cups of perfume.

     At times, sweet and clear from some tea-garden near,
     A ripple of laughter steals out to your ear;
     Anon the wind brings from a samisen's strings
     The pathos that's born of a smile and a tear.

    
      THE difference between an English audience and a French audience at the
      theatre is marked. The Frenchman brings down a witticism on the wing. The
      Briton pauses for it to alight and give him reasonable time for deliberate
      aim. In English playhouses an appreciable number of seconds usually
      precede the smile or the ripple of laughter that follows a facetious turn
      of the least fineness. I disclaim all responsibility for this statement of
      my personal observation, since it has recently been indorsed by one of
      London's most eminent actors.
    
    
      AT the next table, taking his opal drops of absinthe, was a French
      gentleman with the blase aspect of an empty champagne-bottle, which always
      has the air of saying: "I have lived!"
    
    
      WE often read of wonderful manifestations of memory, but they are always
      instances of the faculty working in some special direction. It is memory
      playing, like Paganini, on one string. No doubt the persons performing the
      phenomenal feats ascribed to them have forgotten more than they remember.
      To be able to repeat a hundred lines of verse after a single reading is no
      proof of a retentive mind, excepting so far as the hundred lines go. A man
      might easily fail under such a test, and yet have a good memory; by which
      I mean a catholic one, and that I imagine to be nearly the rarest of
      gifts. I have never met more than four or five persons possessing it. The
      small boy who defined memory as "the thing you forget with" described the
      faculty as it exists and works in the majority of men and women.
    
    
      THE survival in publishers of the imitative instinct is a strong argument
      in support of Mr. Darwin's theory of the descent of man. One publisher no
      sooner brings out a new style of book-cover than half a dozen other
      publishers fall to duplicating it.
    
    
      THE cavalry sabre hung over the chimney-place with a knot of violets tied
      to the dinted guard, there being no known grave to decorate. For many a
      year, on each Decoration Day, a sorrowful woman had come and fastened
      these flowers there. The first time she brought her offering she was a
      slender girl, as fresh as her own violets. It is a slender figure still,
      but there are threads of silver in the black hair.
    
    
      FORTUNATE was Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, who in early youth was taught "to
      abstain from rhetoric, and poetry, and fine writing"&mdash;especially the
      fine writing. Simplicity is art's last word.
    
    
      The man is clearly an adventurer. In the seventeenth century he would have
      worn huge flintlock pistols stuck into a wide leather belt, and been
      something in the seafaring line. The fellow is always smartly dressed, but
      where he lives and how he lives are as unknown as "what song the Sirens
      sang, or what name Achilles assumed when he hid himself among women." He
      is a man who apparently has no appointment with his breakfast and whose
      dinner is a chance acquaintance. His probable banker is the next person. A
      great city like this is the only geography for such a character. He would
      be impossible in a small country town, where everybody knows everybody and
      what everybody has for lunch.
    
    
      I HAVE been seeking, thus far in vain, for the proprietor of the saying
      that "Economy is second or third cousin to Avarice." I went rather
      confidently to Rochefoucauld, but it is not among that gentleman's light
      luggage of cynical maxims.
    
    
      THERE is a popular vague impression that butchers are not allowed to serve
      as jurors on murder trials. This is not really the case, but it logically
      might be. To a man daily familiar with the lurid incidents of the abattoir,
      the summary extinction of a fellow creature (whether the victim or the
      criminal) can scarcely seem a circumstance of so serious moment as to
      another man engaged in less strenuous pursuits. WE do not, and cannot,
      read many of the novels that most delighted our ancestors. Some of our
      popular fiction is doubtless as poor, but poor with a difference. There is
      always a heavy demand for fresh mediocrity. In every generation the least
      cultivated taste has the largest appetite. There is ragtime literature as
      well as ragtime music for the many.
    
    
      G&mdash;&mdash;- is a man who had rather fail in a great purpose than not
      accomplish it in precisely his own way. He has the courage of his
      conviction and the intolerance of his courage. He is opposed to the death
      penalty for murder, but he would willingly have any one electrocuted who
      disagreed with him on the subject.
    
    
      I HAVE thought of an essay to be called "On the Art of Short-Story
      Writing," but have given it up as smacking too much of the shop. It would
      be too intime, since I should have to deal chiefly with my own
      ways, and so give myself the false air of seeming to consider them of
      importance. It would interest nobody to know that I always write the last
      paragraph first, and then work directly up to that, avoiding all
      digressions and side issues. Then who on earth would care to be told about
      the trouble my characters cause me by talking too much? They will talk,
      and I have to let them; but when the story is finished, I go over the
      dialogue and strike out four fifths of the long speeches. I fancy that
      makes my characters pretty mad.
    
    
      THIS is the golden age of the inventor. He is no longer looked upon as a
      madman or a wizard, incontinently to be made away with. Two or three
      centuries ago Marconi would not have escaped a ropeless end with his
      wireless telegraphy. Even so late as 1800, the friends of one Robert
      Fulton seriously entertained the luminous idea of hustling the poor man
      into an asylum for the unsound before he had a chance to fire up the
      boiler of his tiny steamboat on the Hudson river. In olden times the
      pillory and the whipping-post were among the gentler forms of
      encouragement awaiting the inventor. If a man devised an especially
      practical apple-peeler he was in imminent danger of being peeled with it
      by an incensed populace. To-day we hail with enthusiasm a scientific or a
      mechanical discovery, and stand ready to make a stock company of it.
    
    
      A MAN is known by the company his mind keeps. To live continually with
      noble books, with "high-erected thoughts seated in the heart of courtesy,"
      teaches the soul good manners.
    
    
      THE unconventional has ever a morbid attraction for a certain class of
      mind. There is always a small coterie of highly intellectual men and women
      eager to give welcome to whatever is eccentric, obscure, or chaotic.
      Worshipers at the shrine of the Unpopular, they tingle with a sense of
      tolerant superiority when they say: "Of course this is not the kind of
      thing you would like." Sometimes these impressionable souls almost
      seem to make a sort of reputation for their fetish.
    
    
      I HEAR that B&mdash;&mdash;- directed to have himself buried on the edge
      of the pond where his duckstand was located, in order that flocks of
      migrating birds might fly over his grave every autumn. He did not have to
      die, to become a dead shot. A comrade once said of him: "Yes, B&mdash;&mdash;-
      is a great sportsman. He has peppered everything from grouse in North
      Dakota to his best friend in the Maine woods."
    
    
      WHEN the novelist introduces a bore into his novel he must not let him
      bore the reader. The fellow must be made amusing, which he would not be in
      real life. In nine cases out of ten an exact reproduction of real life
      would prove tedious. Facts are not necessarily valuable, and frequently
      they add nothing to fiction. The art of the realistic novelist sometimes
      seems akin to that of the Chinese tailor who perpetuated the old patch on
      the new trousers. True art selects and paraphrases, but seldom gives a
      verbatim translation.
    
    
      THE last meeting I had with Lowell was in the north room of his house at
      Elmwood, the sleeping-room I had occupied during a two years' tenancy of
      the place in his absence abroad. He was lying half propped up in bed,
      convalescing from one of the severe attacks that were ultimately to prove
      fatal. Near the bed was a chair on which stood a marine picture in
      aquarelle&mdash;a stretch of calm sea, a bit of rocky shore in the
      foreground, if I remember, and a vessel at anchor. The afternoon sunlight,
      falling through the window, cast a bloom over the picture, which was
      turned toward Lowell. From time to time, as he spoke, his eyes rested
      thoughtfully on the water-color. A friend, he said, had just sent it to
      him. It seemed to me then, and the fancy has often haunted me since, that
      that ship, in the golden haze, with topsails loosened, was waiting to bear
      his spirit away.
    
    
      CIVILIZATION is the lamb's skin in which barbarism masquerades. If
      somebody has already said that, I forgive him the mortification he causes
      me. At the beginning of the twentieth century barbarism can throw off its
      gentle disguise, and burn a man at the stake as complacently as in the
      Middle Ages.
    
    
      WHAT is slang in one age sometimes goes into the vocabulary of the purist
      in the next. On the other hand, expressions that once were not considered
      inelegant are looked at askance in the period following. The word "brass"
      was formerly an accepted synonym for money; but at present, when it takes
      on that significance, it is not admitted into genteel circles of language.
      It may be said to have seen better days, like another word I have in mind&mdash;a
      word that has become slang, employed in the sense which once did not
      exclude it from very good society. A friend lately informed me that he had
      "fired" his housekeeper&mdash;that is, dismissed her. He little dreamed
      that he was speaking excellent Elizabethan.
    
    
      THE "Journal des Goncourt" is crowded with beautiful and hideous things,
      like a Japanese Museum.
    
    
      "AND she shuddered as she sat, still silent, on her seat, and he saw that
      she shuddered." This is from Anthony Trollope's novel, "Can You Forgive
      Her?" Can you forgive him? is the next question.
    
    
      A LITTLE thing may be perfect, but perfection is not a little thing.
      Possessing this quality, a trifle "no bigger than an agate-stone on the
      forefinger of an alderman" shall outlast the Pyramids. The world will have
      forgotten all the great masterpieces of literature when it forgets
      Lovelace's three verses to Lucasta on his going to the wars. More durable
      than marble or bronze are the words, "I could not love thee, deare, so
      much, loved I not honor more."
    
    
      I CALLED on the dear old doctor this afternoon to say good-by. I shall
      probably not find him here when I come back from the long voyage which I
      have in front of me. He is very fragile, and looks as though a puff of
      wind would blow him away. He said himself, with his old-time cheerfulness,
      that he was attached to this earth by only a little piece of twine. He has
      perceptibly failed since I saw him a month ago; but he was full of the
      wise and radiant talk to which all the world has listened, and will miss.
      I found him absorbed in a newly made card-catalogue of his library. "It
      was absurd of me to have it done," he remarked. "What I really require is
      a little bookcase holding only two volumes; then I could go from one to
      the other in alternation and always find each book as fresh as if I never
      had read it." This arraignment of his memory was in pure jest, for the
      doctor's mind was to the end like an unclouded crystal. It was interesting
      to note how he studied himself, taking his own pulse, as it were, and
      diagnosing his own case in a sort of scientific, impersonal way, as if it
      were somebody else's case and he were the consulting specialist. I
      intended to spend a quarter of an hour with him, and he kept me three
      hours. I went there rather depressed, but I returned home leavened with
      his good spirits, which, I think, will never desert him, here or
      hereafter. To keep the heart unwrinkled, to be hopeful, kindly, cheerful,
      reverent&mdash;that is to triumph over old age.
    
    
      THE thing one reads and likes, and then forgets, is of no account. The
      thing that stays, and haunts one, and refuses to be forgotten, that is the
      sincere thing. I am describing the impression left upon me by Mr.
      Howells's blank-verse sketch called "Father and Mother: A Mystery"&mdash;a
      strangely touching and imaginative piece of work, not unlike in effect to
      some of Maeterlinck's psychical dramas. As I read on, I seemed to be
      standing in a shadow cast by some half-remembered experience of my own in
      a previous state of existence. When I went to bed that night I had to lie
      awake and think it over as an event that had actually befallen me. I
      should call the effect weird, if the word had not lately been
      worked to death. The gloom of Poe and the spirituality of Hawthorne touch
      cold finger-tips in those three or four pages.
    
    
      FOR a character-study&mdash;a man made up entirely of limitations. His
      conservatism and negative qualities to be represented as causing him to
      attain success where men of conviction and real ability fail of it.
    
    
      A DARK, saturnine man sat opposite me at table on board the steamer.
      During the entire run from Sandy Hook to Fastnet Light he addressed no one
      at meal-times excepting his table steward. Seated next to him, on the
      right, was a vivacious gentleman, who, like Gratiano in the play, spoke
      "an infinite deal of nothing." He made persistent and pathetic attempts to
      lure his silent neighbor (we had christened him "William the Silent") into
      conversation, but a monosyllable was always the poor result&mdash;until
      one day. It was the last day of the voyage. We had stopped at the entrance
      to Queenstown harbor to deliver the mails, and some fish had been brought
      aboard. The vivacious gentleman was in a high state of excitement that
      morning at table. "Fresh fish!" he exclaimed; "actually fresh! They seem
      quite different from ours. Irish fish, of course. Can you tell me, sir,"
      he inquired, turning to his gloomy shipmate, "what kind of fish
      these are?" "Cork soles," said the saturnine man, in a deep voice, and
      then went on with his breakfast.
    
    
      LOWELL used to find food for great mirth in General George P. Morris's
      line,
    
    
      "Her heart and morning broke together."
    
    
      Lowell's well-beloved Dr. Donne, however, had an attack of the same
      platitude, and possibly inoculated poor Morris. Even literature seems to
      have its mischief-making bacilli. The late "incomparable and ingenious
      Dean of St. Paul's" says,
    
    
      "The day breaks not, it is my heart."
    
    
      I think Dr. Donne's case rather worse than Morris's. Chaucer had the
      malady in a milder form when he wrote:
    
    
      "Up roos the sonne, and up roos Emelye."
    
    
      The charming naivete of it!
    
    
      SITTING in Ellen Terry's dressing-room at the Lyceum Theatre one evening
      during that lady's temporary absence on the stage, Sarah Bernhardt picked
      up a crayon and wrote this pretty word on the mirror&mdash;Dearling,
      mistaking it for the word darling. The French actress lighted by chance
      upon a Spenserianism now become obsolete without good reason. It is a more
      charming adjective than the one that has replaced it.
    
    
      A DEAD author appears to be bereft of all earthly rights. He is scarcely
      buried before old magazines and newspapers are ransacked in search of
      matters which, for reasons sufficient to him, he had carefully excluded
      from the definitive edition of his collected writings.
    

     He gave the people of his best;
     His worst he kept, his best he gave.

    
      One can imagine a poet tempted to address some such appeal as this to any
      possible future publisher of his poems:
    

     Take what thou wilt, a lyric or a line,
     Take all, take nothing&mdash;and God send thee cheer!
     But my anathema on thee and thine
     If thou add'st aught to what is printed here.

    
      THE claim of this country to call itself "The Land of the Free" must be
      held in abeyance until every man in it, whether he belongs or does not
      belong to a labor organization, shall have the right to work for his daily
      bread.
    
    
      THERE is a strain of primitive poetry running through the entire Irish
      race, a fleeting lyrical emotion which expresses itself in a flash,
      usually in connection with love of country and kindred across the sea. I
      had a touching illustration of it the other morning. The despot who reigns
      over our kitchen was gathering a mess of dandelions on the rear lawn. It
      was one of those blue and gold days which seem especially to belong New
      England. "It's in County Westmeath I 'd be this day," she said, looking up
      at me. "I'd go cool my hands in the grass on my ould mother's grave in
      the bit of churchyard foreninst the priest's house at Mullingar." I
      have seen poorer poetry than that in the magazines.
    
    
      SPEAKING of the late Major Pond, the well-known director of a lecture
      bureau, an old client of his remarked: "He was a most capable manager, but
      it always made me a little sore to have him deduct twenty-five per cent.
      commission." "Pond's Extract," murmured one of the gentlemen present.
    
    
      EACH of our great towns has its "Little Italy," with shops where nothing
      is spoken but Italian and streets in which the alien pedestrian had better
      not linger after nightfall. The chief industry of these exotic communities
      seems to be spaghetti and stilettos. What with our Little Italys and
      Chinatowns, and the like, an American need not cross the ocean in order to
      visit foreign lands and enjoy the benefits of older civilizations.
    
    
      POETS are made as well as born, the proverb notwithstanding. They are made
      possible by the general love of poetry and the consequent imperious demand
      for it. When this is nonexistent, poets become mute, the atmosphere
      stifles them. There would have been no Shakespeare had there been no
      Elizabethan audience. That was an age when, as Emerson finely puts it,
    

     Men became
     Poets, for the air was fame.

    
      THE stolid gentleman in livery who has his carriage-stand at the corner
      opposite my house is constantly touching on the extremes of human
      experience, with probably not the remotest perception of the fact. Now he
      takes a pair of lovers out for an airing, and now he drives the absconding
      bank-teller to the railway-station. Excepting as question of distance, the
      man has positively no choice between a theatre and a graveyard. I met him
      this morning dashing up to the portals of Trinity Church with a bridal
      party, and this afternoon, as I was crossing Cambridge Bridge, I saw him
      creeping along next to the hearse, on his way to Mount Auburn. The wedding
      afforded him no pleasure, and the funeral gave him no grief; yet he was a
      factor in both. It is his odd destiny to be wholly detached from the vital
      part of his own acts. If the carriage itself could speak! The
      autobiography of a public hack written without reservation would be
      dramatic reading.
    
    
      IN this blotted memorandum-book are a score or two of suggestions for
      essays, sketches, and poems, which I have not written, and never shall
      write. The instant I jot down an idea the desire to utilize it leaves me,
      and I turn away to do something unpremeditated. The shabby volume has
      become a sort of Potter's Field where I bury my literary intentions, good
      and bad, without any belief in their final resurrection.
    
    
      A STAGE DIRECTION: exit time; enter Eternity&mdash;with a soliloquy.

      TOM FOLIO
    
    
      IN my early Boston days a gentle soul was often to be met with about town,
      furtively haunting old book-shops and dusty editorial rooms, a man of
      ingratiating simplicity of manner, who always spoke in a low, hesitating
      voice, with a note of refinement in it. He was a devout worshiper of Elia,
      and wrote pleasant discursive essays smacking somewhat of his master's
      flavor&mdash;suggesting rather than imitating it&mdash;which he signed
      "Tom Folio." I forget how he glided into my acquaintanceship; doubtless in
      some way too shy and elusive for remembrance. I never knew him intimately,
      perhaps no one did, but the intercourse between us was most cordial, and
      our chance meetings and bookish chats extended over a space of a dozen
      years.
    
    
      Tom Folio&mdash;I cling to the winning pseudonym&mdash;was sparely built
      and under medium height, or maybe a slight droop of the shoulders made it
      seem so, with a fragile look about him and an aspect of youth that was not
      his. Encountering him casually on a street corner, you would, at the first
      glance, have taken him for a youngish man, but the second glance left you
      doubtful. It was a figure that struck a note of singularity and would have
      attracted your attention even in a crowd.
    
    
      During the first four or five years of our acquaintance, meeting him only
      out of doors or in shops, I had never happened to see him with his hat
      off. One day he recklessly removed it, and in the twinkling of an eye he
      became an elderly bald-headed man. The Tom Folio I once knew had virtually
      vanished. An instant earlier he was a familiar shape; an instant later, an
      almost unrecognizable individual. A narrow fringe of light-colored hair,
      extending from ear to ear under the rear brim of his hat, had perpetrated
      an unintentional deception by leading one to suppose a head profusely
      covered with curly locks. "Tom Folio," I said, "put on your hat and come
      back!" But after that day he never seemed young to me.
    
    
      I had few or no inklings of his life disconnected with the streets and the
      book-stalls, chiefly those on Cornhill or in the vicinity. It is possible
      I am wrong in inferring that he occupied a room somewhere at the South End
      or in South Boston, and lived entirely alone, heating his coffee and
      boiling his egg over an alcohol lamp. I got from him one or two fortuitous
      hints of quaint housekeeping. Every winter, it appeared, some relative,
      far or near, sent him a large batch of mince pies, twenty or thirty at
      least. He once spoke to me of having laid in his winter pie, just as
      another might speak of laying in his winter coal. The only fireside
      companion Tom Folio ever alluded to in my presence was a Maltese cat,
      whose poor health seriously disturbed him from time to time. I suspected
      those mince pies. The cat, I recollect, was named Miss Mowcher.
    
    
      If he had any immediate family ties beyond this I was unaware of them, and
      not curious to be enlightened on the subject. He was more picturesque
      solitary. I preferred him to remain so. Other figures introduced into the
      background of the canvas would have spoiled the artistic effect.
    
    
      Tom Folio was a cheerful, lonely man&mdash;a recluse even when he allowed
      himself to be jostled and hurried along on the turbulent stream of
      humanity sweeping in opposite directions through Washington Street and its
      busy estuaries. He was in the crowd, but not of it. I had so little real
      knowledge of him that I was obliged to imagine his more intimate
      environments. However wide of the mark my conjectures may have fallen,
      they were as satisfying to me as facts would have been. His secluded room
      I could picture to myself with a sense of certainty&mdash;the couch (a
      sofa by day), the cupboard, the writing-table with its student lamp, the
      litter of pamphlets and old quartos and octavos in tattered bindings,
      among which were scarce reprints of his beloved Charles Lamb, and perhaps&mdash;nay,
      surely&mdash;an editio princeps of the "Essays."
    
    
      The gentle Elia never had a gentler follower or a more loving disciple
      than Tom Folio. He moved and had much of his being in the early part of
      the last century. To him the South-Sea House was the most important
      edifice on the globe, remaining the same venerable pile it used to be, in
      spite of all the changes that had befallen it. It was there Charles Lamb
      passed the novitiate of his long years of clerkship in the East India
      Company. In Tom Folio's fancy a slender, boyish figure was still seated,
      quill in hand, behind those stately porticoes looking upon Threadneedle
      Street and Bishopsgate. That famous first paper in the "Essays,"
      describing the South-Sea House and the group of human oddities which
      occupied desks within its gloomy chambers, had left an indelible
      impression upon the dreamer. Every line traced by the "lean annuitant" was
      as familiar to Tom Folio as if he had written it himself. Stray scraps,
      which had escaped the vigilance of able editors, were known to him, and it
      was his to unearth amid a heap of mouldy, worm-eaten magazines, a handful
      of leaves hitherto forgotten of all men. Trifles, yes&mdash;but Charles
      Lamb's! "The king's chaff is as good as other people's corn," says Tom
      Folio.
    
    
      Often his talk was sweet and racy with old-fashioned phrases; the talk of
      a man who loved books and drew habitual breath in an atmosphere of fine
      thought. Next to Charles Lamb, but at a convenable distance, Izaak Walton
      was Tom Folio's favorite. His poet was Alexander Pope, though he thought
      Mr. Addison's tragedy of "Cato" contained some proper good lines. Our
      friend was a wide reader in English classics, greatly preferring the
      literature of the earlier periods to that of the Victorian age. His
      smiling, tenderly expressed disapprobation of various modern authors was
      enchanting. John Keats's verses were monstrous pretty, but
      over-ornamented. A little too much lucent syrup tinct with cinnamon, don't
      you think? The poetry of Shelley might have been composed in the moon by a
      slightly deranged, well-meaning person. If you wanted a sound mind in a
      sound metrical body, why there was Mr. Pope's "Essay on Man." There was
      something winsome and by-gone in the general make-up of Tom Folio. No man
      living in the world ever seemed to me to live so much out of it, or to
      live more comfortably.
    
    
      At times I half suspected him of a convalescent amatory disappointment.
      Perhaps long before I knew him he had taken a little sentimental journey,
      the unsuccessful end of which had touched him with a gentle sadness. It
      was something far off and softened by memory. If Tom Folio had any
      love-affair on hand in my day, it must have been of an airy, platonic sort&mdash;a
      chaste secret passion for Mistress Peg Woffington or Nell Gwyn, or
      possibly Mr. Waller's Saccharissa.
    
    
      Although Tom Folio was not a collector&mdash;that means dividends and bank
      balances&mdash;he had a passion for the Past and all its belongings, with
      a virtuoso's knowledge of them. A fan painted by Vanloo, a bit of rare
      Nankin (he had caught from Charles Lamb the love of old china), or an
      undoctored stipple of Bartolozzi, gave him delight in the handling, though
      he might not aspire to ownership. I believe he would willingly have drunk
      any horrible decoction from a silver teapot of Queen Anne's time. These
      things were not for him in a coarse, materialistic sense; in a spiritual
      sense he held possession of them in fee-simple. I learned thus much of his
      tastes one day during an hour we spent together in the rear showroom of a
      dealer in antiquities.
    
    
      I have spoken of Tom Folio as lonely, but I am inclined to think that I
      mis-stated it. He had hosts of friends who used to climb the rather steep
      staircase leading to that modest third-story front room which I have
      imagined for him&mdash;a room with Turkey-red curtains, I like to believe,
      and a rare engraving of a scene from Mr. Hogarth's excellent moral of "The
      Industrious and Idle Apprentices" pinned against the chimney breast. Young
      Chatterton, who was not always the best of company, dropped in at
      intervals. There Mr. Samuel Pepys had a special chair reserved for him by
      the window, where he could catch a glimpse of the pretty housemaid over
      the way, chatting with the policeman at the area railing. Dr. Johnson and
      the unworldly author of "The Deserted Village" were frequent visitors,
      sometimes appearing together arm-in-arm, with James Boswell, Esq., of
      Auchinleck, following obsequiously behind. Not that Tom Folio did not have
      callers vastly more aristocratic, though he could have had none pleasanter
      or wholesomer. Sir Philip Sidney (who must have given Folio that copy of
      the "Arcadia"), the Viscount St. Albans, and even two or three others
      before whom either of these might have doffed his bonnet, did not disdain
      to gather round that hearthstone. Fielding, Smollett, Sterne, Defoe, Dick
      Steele, Dean Swift&mdash;there was no end to them! On certain nights, when
      all the stolid neighborhood was lapped in slumber, the narrow street
      stretching beneath Tom Folio's windows must have been blocked with
      invisible coaches and sedan-chairs, and illuminated by the visionary glare
      of torches borne by shadowy linkboys hurrying hither and thither. A man so
      sought after and companioned cannot be described as lonely.
    
    
      My memory here recalls the fact that he had a few friends less
      insubstantial&mdash;that quaint anatomy perched on the top of a
      hand-organ, to whom Tom Folio was wont to give a bite of his apple; and
      the brown-legged little Neapolitan who was always nearly certain of a
      copper when this multi-millionaire strolled through the slums on a
      Saturday afternoon&mdash;Saturday probably being the essayist's pay-day.
      The withered woman of the peanut-stand on the corner over against Faneuil
      Hall Market knew him for a friend, as did also the blind lead-pencil
      merchant, whom Tom Folio, on occasions, safely piloted across the stormy
      traffic of Dock Square. Noblesse oblige! He was no stranger in
      those purlieus. Without designing to confuse small things with great, I
      may say that a certain strip of pavement in North Street could be pointed
      out as Tom Folio's Walk, just as Addison's Walk is pointed out on the
      banks of the Cherwell at Oxford.
    
    
      I used to observe that when Tom Folio was not in quest of a print or a
      pamphlet or some such urgent thing, but was walking for mere recreation,
      he instinctively avoided respectable latitudes. He liked best the squalid,
      ill-kept thoroughfares shadowed by tall, smudgy tenement-houses and
      teeming with unprosperous, noisy life. Perhaps he had, half consciously, a
      sense of subtle kinship to the unsuccess and cheerful resignation of it
      all.
    
    
      Returning home from abroad one October morning several years ago, I was
      told that that simple spirit had passed on. His death had been little
      heeded; but in him had passed away an intangible genuine bit of Old Boston&mdash;as
      genuine a bit, in its kind, as the Autocrat himself&mdash;a personality
      not to be restored or replaced. Tom Folio could never happen again!
    
    
      Strolling to-day through the streets of the older section of the town, I
      miss many a venerable landmark submerged in the rising tide of change, but
      I miss nothing quite so much as I do the sight of Tom Folio entering the
      doorway of the Old Corner Bookstore, or carefully taking down a musty
      volume from its shelf at some melancholy old book-stall on Cornhill.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      FLEABODY AND OTHER QUEER NAMES
    
    
      WHEN an English novelist does us the honor to introduce any of our
      countrymen into his fiction, he generally displays a commendable desire to
      present something typical in the way of names for his adopted characters&mdash;to
      give a dash of local color, as it were, with his nomenclature. His success
      is seldom commensurate to the desire. He falls into the error of appealing
      to his invention, instead of consulting some city directory, in which he
      would find more material than he could exhaust in ten centuries. Charles
      Reade might have secured in the pages of such a compendium a happier title
      than Fullalove for his Yankee sea-captain; though I doubt, on the whole,
      if Anthony Trollope could have discovered anything better than Olivia Q.
      Fleabody for the young woman from "the States" in his novel called "Is He
      Popenjoy?"
    
    
      To christen a sprightly young female advocate of woman's rights Olivia Q.
      Fleabody was very happy indeed; to be candid, it was much better than was
      usual with Mr. Trollope, whose understanding of American life and manners
      was not enlarged by extensive travel in this country. An English tourist's
      preconceived idea of us is a thing he brings over with him on the steamer
      and carries home again intact; it is as much a part of his indispensable
      impedimenta as his hatbox. But Fleabody is excellent; it was probably
      suggested by Peabody, which may have struck Mr. Trollope as comical (just
      as Trollope strikes us as comical), or, at least, as not serious.
      What a capital name Veronica Trollope would be for a hoydenish young woman
      in a society novel! I fancy that all foreign names are odd to the alien. I
      remember that the signs above shop-doors in England and on the Continent
      used to amuse me often enough, when I was over there. It is a notable
      circumstance that extraordinary names never seem extraordinary to the
      persons bearing them. If a fellow-creature were branded Ebenezer
      Cuttlefish he would remain to the end of his days quite unconscious of
      anything out of the common.
    
    
      I am aware that many of our American names are sufficiently queer; but
      English writers make merry over them, as if our most eccentric were not
      thrown into the shade by some of their own. No American, living or dead,
      can surpass the verbal infelicity of Knatchbull-Hugessen, for example&mdash;if
      the gentleman will forgive me for conscripting him. Quite as remarkable,
      in a grimly significant way, is the appellation of a British officer who
      was fighting the Boers in the Transvaal in the year of blessed memory
      1899. This young soldier, who highly distinguished himself on the field,
      was known to his brothers-in-arms as Major Pine Coffin. I trust that the
      gallant major became a colonel later and is still alive. It would eclipse
      the gayety of nations to lose a man with a name like that.
    
    
      Several years ago I read in the sober police reports of "The Pall Mall
      Gazette" an account of a young man named George F. Onions, who was
      arrested (it ought to have been by "a peeler") for purloining money from
      his employers, Messrs. Joseph Pickles &amp; Son, stuff merchants, of
      Bradford&mdash;des noms bien idylliques! What mortal could have a
      more ludicrous name than Onions, unless it were Pickles, or Pickled
      Onions? And then for Onions to rob Pickles! Could there be a more
      incredible coincidence? As a coincidence it is nearly sublime. No
      story-writer would dare to present that fact or those names in his
      fiction; neither would be accepted as possible. Meanwhile Olivia Q.
      Fleabody is ben trovato.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      A NOTE ON "L'AIGLON"
    
    
      THE night-scene on the battlefield of Wagram in "L'Aiglon"&mdash;an
      episode whose sharp pathos pierces the heart and the imagination like the
      point of a rapier&mdash;bears a striking resemblance to a picturesque
      passage in Victor Hugo's "Les Miserables." It is the one intense great
      moment in the play, and has been widely discussed, but so far as I am
      aware none of M. Rostand's innumerable critics has touched on the
      resemblance mentioned. In the master's romance it is not the field of
      Wagram, but the field of Waterloo, that is magically repeopled with
      contending armies of spooks, to use the grim old Dutch word, and made
      vivid to the mind's eye. The passage occurs at the end of the sixteenth
      chapter in the second part of "Les Miserables" (Cosette), and runs as
      follows:
    
    
      Le champ de Waterloo aujourd'hui a le calme qui appartient a la terre,
      support impassible de l'homme, et il resemble a toutes les plaines. La
      nuit pourtant une espece de brume visionnaire s'en degage, et si quelque
      voyageur s'y promene, s'il regarde, s'il ecoute, s'il reve comme Virgile
      dans les funestes plaines de Philippes, l'hallucination de la catastrophe
      le saisit. L'effrayant 18 juin revit; la fausse colline-monument s'efface,
      ce lion quelconque se dissipe, le champ de bataille reprend sa realite;
      des lignes d'infanterie ondulent dans la plaine, des galops furieux
      traversent l'horizon; le songeur effare voit l'eclair des sabres,
      l'etincelle des bayonnettes, le flamboiement des bombes,
      l'entre-croisement monstrueux des tonnerres; il entend, comme un rale au
      fond d'une tombe, la clameur vague de la bataille-fantome; ces ombres, ce
      sont les grenadiers; ces lueurs, ce sont les cuirassiers; . . . tout cela
      n'est plus et se heurte et combat encore; et les ravins s'empourprent, et
      les arbres frissonnent, et il y a de la furie jusque dans les nuees, et,
      dans les tenebres, toutes ces hauteurs farouches, Mont-Saint Jean,
      Hougomont, Frischemont, Papelotte, Plancenoit, apparaissent confusement
      couronnees de tourbillons de spectres s'exterminant. (1)
    
    
      Here is the whole battle scene in "L'Aiglon," with scarcely a gruesome
      detail omitted. The vast plain glimmering in phantasmal light; the ghostly
      squadrons hurling themselves against one another (seen only through the
      eyes of the poor little Duke of Reichstadt); the mangled shapes lying
      motionless in various postures of death upon the blood-stained sward; the
      moans of the wounded rising up and sweeping by like vague wailings of the
      wind&mdash;all this might be taken for an artful appropriation of Victor
      Hugo's text; but I do not think it was, though it is possible that a faint
      reflection of a brilliant page, read in early youth, still lingered on the
      retina of M. Rostand's memory. If such were the case, it does not
      necessarily detract from the integrity of the conception or the
      playwright's presentment of it.
    

     (1) The field of Waterloo has to-day the peacefulness which
     belongs to earth, the impassive support of man, and is like
     all other plains.  At night, however, a kind of visionary
     mist is exhaled, and if any traveler walks there, and
     watches and listens, and dreams like Virgil on the sorrowful
     plains of Philippi, the hallucination of the catastrophe
     takes possession of him.  The terrible June 18 relives; the
     artificial commemorative mound effaces itself, the lion
     disappears, the field of battle assumes its reality; lines
     of infantry waver on the plain, the horizon is broken by
     furious charges of cavalry; the alarmed dreamer sees the
     gleam of sabres, the glimmer of bayonets, the lurid glare of
     bursting shells, the clashing of mighty thunderbolts; the
     muffled clamor of the phantom conflict comes to him like
     dying moans from the tomb; these shadows are grenadiers,
     these lights are cuirassiers . . . all this does not really
     exist, yet the combat goes on; the ravines are stained with
     purple, the trees tremble, there is fury even in the clouds,
     and in the obscurity the sombre heights&mdash;Mont Saint-Jean,
     Hougomont, Frischemont, Papelotte, and Plancenoit&mdash;ap-pear
     dimly crowned with throngs of apparitions annihilating one
     another.

    
      The idea of repeopling old battlefields with the shades of vanished hosts
      is not novel. In such tragic spots the twilight always lays a dark hand on
      the imagination, and prompts one to invoke the unappeased spirit of the
      past that haunts the place. One summer evening long ago, as I was standing
      alone by the ruined walls of Hougomont, with that sense of not being alone
      which is sometimes so strangely stirred by solitude, I had a sudden vision
      of that desperate last charge of Napoleon's Old Guard. Marshal Ney rose
      from the grave and again shouted those heroic words to Drouet d'Erlon:
      "Are you not going to get yourself killed?" For an instant a thousand
      sabres flashed in the air. The deathly silence that accompanied the
      ghostly onset was an added poignancy to the short-lived dream. A moment
      later I beheld a hunched little figure mounted on a white horse with
      housings of purple velvet. The reins lay slack in the rider's hand; his
      three-cornered hat was slouched over his brows, and his chin rested on the
      breast of his great-coat. Thus he slowly rode away through the twilight,
      and nobody cried, Vive l'Empereur!
    
    
      The ground on which a famous battle has been fought casts a spell upon
      every man's mind; and the impression made upon two men of poetic genius,
      like Victor Hugo and Edmond Rostand, might well be nearly identical. This
      sufficiently explains the likeness between the fantastic silhouette in
      "Les Miserables" and the battle of the ghosts in "L'Aiglon." A muse so
      rich in the improbable as M. Rostand's need not borrow a piece of
      supernaturalness from anybody.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      PLOT AND CHARACTER
    
    
      HENRY JAMES, in his paper on Anthony Trollope, says that if Trollope "had
      taken sides on the rather superficial opposition between novels of
      character and novels of plot, I can imagine him to have said (except that
      he never expressed himself in epigram) that he preferred the former class,
      inasmuch as character in itself is plot, while plot is by no means
      character." So neat an antithesis would surely never have found itself
      between Mr. Trollope's lips if Mr. James had not cunningly lent it to him.
      Whatever theory of novel-writing Mr. Trollope may have preached, his
      almost invariable practice was to have a plot. He always had a story
      to tell, and a story involves beginning, middle, and end&mdash;in short, a
      framework of some description.
    
    
      There have been delightful books filled wholly with character-drawing; but
      they have not been great novels. The great novel deals with human action
      as well as with mental portraiture and analysis. That "character in itself
      is plot" is true only in a limited sense. A plan, a motive with a logical
      conclusion, is as necessary to a novel or a romance as it is to a drama. A
      group of skillfully made-up men and women lounging in the green-room or at
      the wings is not the play. It is not enough to say that this is Romeo and
      that Lady Macbeth. It is not enough to inform us that certain passions are
      supposed to be embodied in such and such persons: these persons should be
      placed in situations developing those passions. A series of unrelated
      scenes and dialogues leading to nothing is inadequate.
    
    
      Mr. James's engaging epigram seems to me vulnerable at both ends&mdash;unlike
      Achilles. "Plot is by no means character." Strictly speaking, it is not.
      It appears to me, however, that plot approaches nearer to being character
      than character does to being plot. Plot necessitates action, and it is
      impossible to describe a man's actions' under whatever conditions, without
      revealing something of his character, his way of looking at things, his
      moral and mental pose. What a hero of fiction does paints him
      better than what he says, and vastly better than anything his
      creator may say of him. Mr. James asserts that "we care what happens to
      people only in proportion as we know what people are." I think we care
      very little what people are (in fiction) when we do not know what happens
      to them.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      THE CRUELTY OF SCIENCE
    
    
      IN the process of their experiments upon the bodies of living animals some
      anatomists do not, I fear, sufficiently realize that
    

     The poor beetle, that we tread upon,
     In corporal sufferance, finds a pang as great
     As when a giant dies.

    
      I am not for a moment challenging the necessity of vivisection, though
      distinguished surgeons have themselves challenged it; I merely contend
      that science is apt to be cold-hearted, and does not seem always to take
      into consideration the tortures she inflicts in her search for knowledge.
    
    
      Just now, in turning over the leaves of an old number of the "London
      Lancet," I came upon the report of a lecture on experimental physiology
      delivered by Professor William Rutherford before a learned association in
      London. Though the type had become antiquated and the paper yellowed in
      the lapse of years, the pathos of those pages was alive and palpitating.
    
    
      The following passages from the report will illustrate not unfairly the
      point I am making. In the course of his remarks the lecturer exhibited
      certain interesting experiments on living frogs. Intellectually I go very
      strongly for Professor Rutherford, but I am bound to confess that the
      weight of my sympathy rests with the frogs.
    
    
      Observe this frog [said the professor], it is regarding our manoeuvres
      with a somewhat lively air. Now and then it gives a jump. What the precise
      object of its leaps may be I dare not pretend to say; but probably it
      regards us with some apprehension, and desires to escape.
    
    
      To be perfectly impartial, it must be admitted that the frog had some
      slight reason for apprehension. The lecturer proceeded:
    
    
      I touch one of its toes, and you see it resents the molestation in a very
      decided manner. Why does it so struggle to get away when I pinch its toes?
      Doubtless, you will say, because it feels the pinch and would rather not
      have it repeated. I now behead the animal with the aid of a sharp chisel.
      . . . The headless trunk lies as though it were dead. The spinal cord
      seems to be suffering from shock. Probably, however, it will soon recover
      from this. . . . Observe that the animal has now spontaneously
      drawn up its legs and arms, and it is sitting with its neck erect just as
      if it had not lost its head at all. I pinch its toes, and you see the leg
      is at once thrust out as if to spurn away the offending instrument. Does
      it still feel? and is the motion still the result of the volition?
    
    
      That the frog did feel, and delicately hinted at the circumstance, there
      seems to be no room to doubt, for Professor Rutherford related that having
      once decapitated a frog, the animal suddenly bounded from the table, a
      movement that presumably indicated a kind of consciousness. He then
      returned to the subject immediately under observation, pinched its foot
      again, the frog again "resenting the stimulation." He then thrust a needle
      down the spinal cord. "The limbs are now flaccid," observed the
      experimenter; "we may wait as long as we please, but a pinch of the toes
      will never again cause the limbs of this animal to move." Here is where
      congratulations can come in for la grenouille. That frog being
      concluded, the lecturer continued:
    
    
      I take another frog. In this case I open the cranium and remove the brain
      and medulla oblongata. . . . I thrust a pin through the nose and hang the
      animal thereby to a support, so that it can move its pendent legs without
      any difficulty. . . . I gently pinch the toes. . . . The leg of the same
      side is pulled up. . . . I pinch the same more severely. . . . Both legs
      are thrown into motion.
    
    
      Having thus satisfactorily proved that the wretched creature could still
      suffer acutely, the professor resumed:
    
    
      The cutaneous nerves of the frog are extremely sensitive to acids; so I
      put a drop of acetic acid on the outside of one knee. This, you see, gives
      rise to most violent movements both of arms and legs, and notice
      particularly that the animal is using the toes of the leg on the same side
      for the purpose of rubbing the irritated spot. I dip the whole animal into
      water in order to wash away the acid, and now it is all at rest again. . .
      . I put a drop of acid on the skin over the lumbar region of the spine. .
      . . Both feet are instantly raised to the irritated spot. The animal is
      able to localize the seat of irritation. . . . I wash the acid from the
      back, and I amputate one of the feet at the ankle. . . . I apply a drop of
      acid over the knee of the footless leg. . . . Again, the animal turns the
      leg towards the knee, as if to reach the irritated spot with the toes;
      these, however, are not now available. But watch the other foot. The foot
      of the other leg is now being used to rub away the acid. The animal,
      finding that the object is not accomplished with the foot of the same
      side, uses the other one.
    
    
      I think that at least one thing will be patent to every unprejudiced
      reader of these excerpts, namely&mdash;that any frog (with its head on or
      its head off) which happened to make the personal acquaintance of
      Professor Rutherford must have found him poor company. What benefit
      science may have derived from such association I am not qualified to
      pronounce upon. The lecturer showed conclusively that the frog is a
      peculiarly sensitive and intelligent little batrachian. I hope that the
      genial professor, in the years which followed, did not frequently consider
      it necessary to demonstrate the fact.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      LEIGH HUNT AND BARRY CORNWALL
    
    
      IT has recently become the fashion to speak disparagingly of Leigh Hunt as
      a poet, to class him as a sort of pursuivant or shield-bearer to
      Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats. Truth to tell, Hunt was not a Keats nor a
      Shelley nor a Coleridge, but he was a most excellent Hunt. He was a
      delightful essayist&mdash;quite unsurpassed, indeed, in his blithe,
      optimistic way&mdash;and as a poet deserves to rank high among the lesser
      singers of his time. I should place him far above Barry Cornwall, who has
      not half the freshness, variety, and originality of his compeer.
    
    
      I instance Barry Cornwall because there has seemed a disposition since his
      death to praise him unduly. Barry Cornwall has always struck me as
      extremely artificial, especially in his dramatic sketches. His verses in
      this line are mostly soft Elizabethan echoes. Of course a dramatist may
      find it to his profit to go out of his own age and atmosphere for
      inspiration; but in order successfully to do so he must be a dramatist.
      Barry Cornwall fell short of filling the role; he got no further than the
      composing of brief disconnected scenes and scraps of soliloquies, and a
      tragedy entitled Mirandola, for which the stage had no use. His chief
      claim to recognition lies in his lyrics. Here, as in the dramatic studies,
      his attitude is nearly always affected. He studiously strives to reproduce
      the form and spirit of the early poets. Being a Londoner, he naturally
      sings much of rural English life, but his England is the England of two or
      three centuries ago. He has a great deal to say about the "falcon," but
      the poor bird has the air of beating fatigued wings against the
      bookshelves of a well-furnished library! This well-furnished library was&mdash;if
      I may be pardoned a mixed image&mdash;the rock on which Barry Cornwall
      split. He did not look into his own heart, and write: he looked into his
      books.
    
    
      A poet need not confine himself to his individual experiences; the world
      is all before him where to choose; but there are subjects which he had
      better not handle unless he have some personal knowledge of them. The sea
      is one of these. The man who sang,
    

     The sea! the sea! the open sea!
     The blue, the fresh, the ever free!

    
      (a couplet which the Gifted Hopkins might have penned), should never have
      permitted himself to sing of the ocean. I am quoting from one of Barry
      Cornwall's most popular lyrics. When I first read this singularly vapid
      poem years ago, in mid-Atlantic, I wondered if the author had ever laid
      eyes on any piece of water wider than the Thames at Greenwich, and in
      looking over Barry Cornwall's "Life and Letters" I am not so much
      surprised as amused to learn that he was never out of sight of land in the
      whole course of his existence. It is to be said of him more positively
      than the captain of the Pinafore said it of himself, that he was hardly
      ever sick at sea.
    
    
      Imagine Byron or Shelley, who knew the ocean in all its protean moods,
      piping such thin feebleness as
    
    
      "The blue, the fresh, the ever free!"
    
    
      To do that required a man whose acquaintance with the deep was limited to
      a view of it from an upper window at Margate or Scarborough. Even frequent
      dinners of turbot and whitebait at the sign of The Ship and Turtle will
      not enable one to write sea poetry.
    
    
      Considering the actual facts, there is something weird in the statement,
    

     I 'm on the sea! I 'm on the sea!
     I am where I would ever be.

    
      The words, to be sure, are placed in the mouth of an imagined sailor, but
      they are none the less diverting. The stanza containing the distich ends
      with a striking piece of realism:
    

     If a storm should come and awake the deep,
     What matter?  I shall ride and sleep.

    
      This is the course of action usually pursued by sailors during a gale. The
      first or second mate goes around and tucks them up comfortably, each in
      his hammock, and serves them out an extra ration of grog after the storm
      is over.
    
    
      Barry Cornwall must have had an exceptionally winning personality, for he
      drew to him the friendship of men as differently constituted as Thackeray,
      Carlyle, Browning, and Forster. He was liked by the best of his time, from
      Charles Lamb down to Algernon Swinburne, who caught a glimpse of the aged
      poet in his vanishing. The personal magnetism of an author does not extend
      far beyond the orbit of his contemporaries. It is of the lyrist and not of
      the man I am speaking here. One could wish he had written more prose like
      his admirable "Recollections of Elia."
    
    
      Barry Cornwall seldom sounds a natural note, but when he does it is
      extremely sweet. That little ballad in the minor key beginning,
    

     Touch us gently, Time!
     Let us glide adown thy stream,
was written in one of his rare moments. Leigh Hunt, though not without
questionable mannerisms, was rich in the inspiration that came but
infrequently to his friend. Hunt's verse is full of natural felicities.
He also was a bookman, but, unlike Barry Cornwall, he generally knew how
to mint his gathered gold, and to stamp the coinage with his own head.
In "Hero and Leander" there is one line which, at my valuing, is worth
any twenty stanzas that Barry Cornwall has written:

     So might they now have lived, and so have died;
     The story's heart, to me, still beats against its side.

    
      Hunt's fortunate verse about the kiss Jane Carlyle gave him lingers on
      everybody's lip. That and the rhyme of "Abou Ben Adhem and the Angel" are
      spice enough to embalm a man's memory. After all, it takes only a handful.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      DECORATION DAY
    
    
      HOW quickly Nature takes possession of a deserted battlefield, and goes to
      work repairing the ravages of man! With invisible magic hand she smooths
      the rough earthworks, fills the rifle-pits with delicate flowers, and
      wraps the splintered tree-trunks with her fluent drapery of tendrils. Soon
      the whole sharp outline of the spot is lost in unremembering grass. Where
      the deadly rifle-ball whistled through the foliage, the robin or the
      thrush pipes its tremulous note; and where the menacing shell described
      its curve through the air, a harmless crow flies in circles. Season after
      season the gentle work goes on, healing the wounds and rents made by the
      merciless enginery of war, until at last the once hotly contested
      battleground differs from none of its quiet surroundings, except, perhaps,
      that here the flowers take a richer tint and the grasses a deeper emerald.
    
    
      It is thus the battle lines may be obliterated by Time, but there are left
      other and more lasting relics of the struggle. That dinted army sabre,
      with a bit of faded crepe knotted at its hilt, which hangs over the
      mantel-piece of the "best room" of many a town and country house in these
      States, is one; and the graven headstone of the fallen hero is another.
      The old swords will be treasured and handed down from generation to
      generation as priceless heirlooms, and with them, let us trust, will be
      cherished the custom of dressing with annual flowers the resting-places of
      those who fell during the Civil War.
    

     With the tears a Land hath shed
     Their graves should ever be green.

     Ever their fair, true glory
     Fondly should fame rehearse&mdash;
     Light of legend and story,
     Flower of marble and verse.

    
      The impulse which led us to set apart a day for decorating the graves of
      our soldiers sprung from the grieved heart of the nation, and in our own
      time there is little chance of the rite being neglected. But the
      generations that come after us should not allow the observance to fall
      into disuse. What with us is an expression of fresh love and sorrow,
      should be with them an acknowledgment of an incalculable debt.
    
    
      Decoration Day is the most beautiful of our national holidays. How
      different from those sullen batteries which used to go rumbling through
      our streets are the crowds of light carriages, laden with flowers and
      greenery, wending their way to the neighboring cemeteries! The grim cannon
      have turned into palm branches, and the shell and shrapnel into peach
      blooms. There is no hint of war in these gay baggage trains, except the
      presence of men in undress uniform, and perhaps here and there an empty
      sleeve to remind one of what has been. Year by year that empty sleeve is
      less in evidence.
    
    
      The observance of Decoration Day is unmarked by that disorder and
      confusion common enough with our people in their holiday moods. The
      earlier sorrow has faded out of the hour, leaving a softened solemnity. It
      quickly ceased to be simply a local commemoration. While the sequestered
      country churchyards and burial-places near our great northern cities were
      being hung with May garlands, the thought could not but come to us that
      there were graves lying southward above which bent a grief as tender and
      sacred as our own. Invisibly we dropped unseen flowers upon those mounds.
      There is a beautiful significance in the fact that, two years after the
      close of the war, the women of Columbus, Mississippi, laid their offerings
      alike on Northern and Southern graves. When all is said, the great Nation
      has but one heart.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      WRITERS AND TALKERS
    
    
      AS a class, literary men do not shine in conversation. The scintillating
      and playful essayist whom you pictured to yourself as the most genial and
      entertaining of companions, turns out to be a shy and untalkable
      individual, who chills you with his reticence when you chance to meet him.
      The poet whose fascinating volume you always drop into your gripsack on
      your summer vacation&mdash;the poet whom you have so long desired to know
      personally&mdash;is a moody and abstracted middle-aged gentleman, who
      fails to catch your name on introduction, and seems the avatar of the
      commonplace. The witty and ferocious critic whom your fancy had painted as
      a literary cannibal with a morbid appetite for tender young poets&mdash;the
      writer of those caustic and scholarly reviews which you never neglect to
      read&mdash;destroys the un-lifelike portrait you had drawn by appearing
      before you as a personage of slender limb and deprecating glance, who
      stammers and makes a painful spectacle of himself when you ask him his
      opinion of "The Glees of the Gulches," by Popocatepetl Jones. The slender,
      dark-haired novelist of your imagination, with epigrammatic points to his
      mustache, suddenly takes the shape of a short, smoothly-shaven blond man,
      whose conversation does not sparkle at all, and you were on the lookout
      for the most brilliant of verbal fireworks. Perhaps it is a dramatist you
      have idealized. Fresh from witnessing his delightful comedy of manners,
      you meet him face to face only to discover that his own manners are
      anything but delightful. The play and the playwright are two very distinct
      entities. You grow skeptical touching the truth of Buffon's assertion that
      the style is the man himself. Who that has encountered his favorite author
      in the flesh has not sometimes been a little, if not wholly, disappointed?
    
    
      After all, is it not expecting too much to expect a novelist to talk as
      cleverly as the clever characters in his novels? Must a dramatist
      necessarily go about armed to the teeth with crisp dialogue? May not a
      poet be allowed to lay aside his singing-robes and put on a conventional
      dress-suit when he dines out? Why is it not permissible in him to be as
      prosaic and tiresome as the rest of the company? He usually is.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      ON EARLY RISING
    
    
      A CERTAIN scientific gentleman of my acquaintance, who has devoted years
      to investigating the subject, states that he has never come across a case
      of remarkable longevity unaccompanied by the habit of early rising; from
      which testimony it might be inferred that they die early who lie abed
      late. But this would be getting out at the wrong station. That the
      majority of elderly persons are early risers is due to the simple fact
      that they cannot sleep mornings. After a man passes his fiftieth milestone
      he usually awakens at dawn, and his wakefulness is no credit to him. As
      the theorist confined his observations to the aged, he easily reached the
      conclusion that men live to be old because they do not sleep late, instead
      of perceiving that men do not sleep late because they are old. He moreover
      failed to take into account the numberless young lives that have been
      shortened by matutinal habits.
    
    
      The intelligent reader, and no other is supposable, need not be told that
      the early bird aphorism is a warning and not an incentive. The fate of the
      worm refutes the pretended ethical teaching of the proverb, which assumes
      to illustrate the advantage of early rising and does so by showing how
      extremely dangerous it is. I have no patience with the worm, and when I
      rise with the lark I am always careful to select a lark that has overslept
      himself.
    
    
      The example set by this mythical bird, a mythical bird so far as New
      England is concerned, has wrought wide-spread mischief and discomfort. It
      is worth noting that his method of accomplishing these ends is directly
      the reverse of that of the Caribbean insect mentioned by Lafcadio Hearn in
      his enchanting "Two Years in the French West Indies"&mdash;a species of
      colossal cricket called the wood-kid; in the creole tongue, cabritt-bois.
      This ingenious pest works a soothing, sleep-compelling chant from sundown
      until precisely half past four in the morning, when it suddenly stops and
      by its silence awakens everybody it has lulled into slumber with its
      insidious croon. Mr. Hearn, with strange obtuseness to the enormity of the
      thing, blandly remarks: "For thousands of early risers too poor to own a
      clock, the cessation of its song is the signal to get up." I devoutly
      trust that none of the West India islands furnishing such satanic
      entomological specimens will ever be annexed to the United States. Some of
      our extreme advocates of territorial expansion might spend a profitable
      few weeks on one of those favored isles. A brief association with that cabritt-bois
      would be likely to cool the enthusiasm of the most ardent imperialist.
    
    
      An incalculable amount of specious sentiment has been lavished upon
      daybreak, chiefly by poets who breakfasted, when they did breakfast, at
      mid-day. It is charitably to be said that their practice was better than
      their precept&mdash;or their poetry. Thomson, the author of "The Castle of
      Indolence," who gave birth to the depraved apostrophe,
    
    
      "Falsely luxurious, will not man awake,"
    
    
      was one of the laziest men of his century. He customarily lay in bed until
      noon meditating pentameters on sunrise. This creature used to be seen in
      his garden of an afternoon, with both hands in his waistcoat pockets,
      eating peaches from a pendent bough. Nearly all the English poets who at
      that epoch celebrated what they called "the effulgent orb of day" were
      denizens of London, where pure sunshine is unknown eleven months out of
      the twelve.
    
    
      In a great city there are few incentives to early rising. What charm is
      there in roof-tops and chimney-stacks to induce one to escape even from a
      nightmare? What is more depressing than a city street before the
      shop-windows have lifted an eyelid, when "the very houses seem asleep," as
      Wordsworth says, and nobody is astir but the belated burglar or the
      milk-and-water man or Mary washing off the front steps? Daybreak at the
      seaside or up among the mountains is sometimes worth while, though
      familiarity with it breeds indifference. The man forced by restlessness or
      occupation to drink the first vintage of the morning every day of his life
      has no right appreciation of the beverage, however much he may profess to
      relish it. It is only your habitual late riser who takes in the full
      flavor of Nature at those rare intervals when he gets up to go a-fishing.
      He brings virginal emotions and unsatiated eyes to the sparkling freshness
      of earth and stream and sky. For him&mdash;a momentary Adam&mdash;the
      world is newly created. It is Eden come again, with Eve in the similitude
      of a three-pound trout.
    
    
      In the country, then, it is well enough occasionally to dress by
      candle-light and assist at the ceremony of dawn; it is well if for no
      other purpose than to disarm the intolerance of the professional early
      riser who, were he in a state of perfect health, would not be the
      wandering victim of insomnia, and boast of it. There are few small things
      more exasperating than this early bird with the worm of his conceit in his
      bill.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      UN POETE MANQUE
    
    
      IN the first volume of Miss Dickinson's poetical melange is a little poem
      which needs only a slight revision of the initial stanza to entitle it to
      rank with some of the swallow-flights in Heine's lyrical intermezzo. I
      have tentatively tucked a rhyme into that opening stanza:
    

     I taste a liquor never brewed
     In vats upon the Rhine;
     No tankard ever held a draught
     Of alcohol like mine.

     Inebriate of air am I,
     And debauchee of dew,
     Reeling, through endless summer days,
     From inns of molten blue.

     When landlords turn the drunken bee
     Out of the Foxglove's door,
     When butterflies renounce their drams,
     I shall but drink the more!
     Till seraphs swing their snowy caps
     And saints to windows run,
     To see the little tippler
     Leaning against the sun!

    
      Those inns of molten blue, and the disreputable honey-gatherer who gets
      himself turned out-of-doors at the sign of the Foxglove, are very taking
      matters. I know of more important things that interest me vastly less.
      This is one of the ten or twelve brief pieces so nearly perfect in
      structure as almost to warrant the reader in suspecting that Miss
      Dickinson's general disregard of form was a deliberate affectation. The
      artistic finish of the following sunset-piece makes her usual quatrains
      unforgivable:
    

     This is the land the sunset washes,
     These are the banks of the Yellow Sea;
     Where it rose, or whither it rushes,
     These are the western mystery!

     Night after night her purple traffic
     Strews the landing with opal bales;
     Merchantmen poise upon horizons,
     Dip, and vanish with fairy sails.

    
      The little picture has all the opaline atmosphere of a Claude Lorraine.
      One instantly frames it in one's memory. Several such bits of
      impressionist landscape may be found in the portfolio.
    
    
      It is to be said, in passing, that there are few things in Miss
      Dickinson's poetry so felicitous as Mr. Higginson's characterization of it
      in his preface to the volume: "In many cases these verses will seem to the
      reader like poetry pulled up by the roots, with rain and dew and
      earth clinging to them." Possibly it might be objected that this is not
      the best way to gather either flowers or poetry.
    
    
      Miss Dickinson possessed an extremely unconventional and bizarre mind. She
      was deeply tinged by the mysticism of Blake, and strongly influenced by
      the mannerism of Emerson. The very gesture with which she tied her
      bonnet-strings, preparatory to one of her nun-like walks in her garden at
      Amherst, must have had something dreamy and Emersonian in it. She had much
      fancy of a quaint kind, but only, as it appears to me, intermittent
      flashes of imagination.
    
    
      That Miss Dickinson's memoranda have a certain something which, for want
      of a more precise name, we term quality, is not to be denied. But
      the incoherence and shapelessness of the greater part of her verse are
      fatal. On nearly every page one lights upon an unsupported exquisite line
      or a lonely happy epithet; but a single happy epithet or an isolated
      exquisite line does not constitute a poem. What Lowell says of Dr. Donne
      applies in a manner to Miss Dickinson: "Donne is full of salient verses
      that would take the rudest March winds of criticism with their beauty, of
      thoughts that first tease us like charades and then delight us with the
      felicity of their solution; but these have not saved him. He is exiled to
      the limbo of the formless and the fragmentary."
    
    
      Touching this question of mere technique Mr. Ruskin has a word to say (it
      appears that he said it "in his earlier and better days"), and Mr.
      Higginson quotes it: "No weight, nor mass, nor beauty of execution can
      outweigh one grain or fragment of thought." This is a proposition to which
      one would cordially subscribe if it were not so intemperately stated. A
      suggestive commentary on Mr. Ruskin's impressive dictum is furnished by
      his own volume of verse. The substance of it is weighty enough, but the
      workmanship lacks just that touch which distinguishes the artist from the
      bungler&mdash;the touch which Mr. Ruskin, except when writing prose,
      appears not much to have regarded either in his later or "in his earlier
      and better days."
    
    
      Miss Dickinson's stanzas, with their impossible rhyme, their involved
      significance, their interrupted flute-note of birds that have no
      continuous music, seem to have caught the ear of a group of eager
      listeners. A shy New England bluebird, shifting its light load of song,
      has for the moment been mistaken for a stray nightingale.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      THE MALE COSTUME OF THE PERIOD
    
    
      I WENT to see a play the other night, one of those good old-fashioned
      English comedies that are in five acts and seem to be in fifteen. The
      piece with its wrinkled conventionality, its archaic stiffness, and
      obsolete code of morals, was devoid of interest excepting as a collection
      of dramatic curios. Still I managed to sit it through. The one thing in it
      that held me a pleased spectator was the graceful costume of a certain
      player who looked like a fine old portrait&mdash;by Vandyke or Velasquez,
      let us say&mdash;that had come to life and kicked off its tarnished frame.
    
    
      I do not know at what epoch of the world's history the scene of the play
      was laid; possibly the author originally knew, but it was evident that the
      actors did not, for their make-ups represented quite antagonistic periods.
      This circumstance, however, detracted only slightly from the special
      pleasure I took in the young person called Delorme. He was not in himself
      interesting; he was like that Major Waters in "Pepys's Diary"&mdash;"a
      most amorous melancholy gentleman who is under a despayr in love, which
      makes him bad company;" it was entirely Delorme's dress.
    
    
      I never saw mortal man in a dress more sensible and becoming. The material
      was according to Polonius's dictum, rich but not gaudy, of some dark
      cherry-colored stuff with trimmings of a deeper shade. My idea of a
      doublet is so misty that I shall not venture to affirm that the gentleman
      wore a doublet. It was a loose coat of some description hanging
      negligently from the shoulders and looped at the throat, showing a
      tasteful arrangement of lacework below and at the wrists. Full trousers
      reaching to the tops of buckskin boots, and a low-crowned soft hat&mdash;not
      a Puritan's sugar-loaf, but a picturesque shapeless head-gear, one side
      jauntily fastened up with a jewel&mdash;completed the essential portions
      of our friend's attire. It was a costume to walk in, to ride in, to sit
      in. The wearer of it could not be awkward if he tried, and I will do
      Delorme the justice to say that he put his dress to some severe tests. But
      he was graceful all the while, and made me wish that my countrymen would
      throw aside their present hideous habiliments and hasten to the
      measuring-room of Delorme's tailor.
    
    
      In looking over the plates of an old book of fashions we smile at the
      monstrous attire in which our worthy great-grandsires saw fit to deck
      themselves. Presently it will be the turn of posterity to smile at us, for
      in our own way we are no less ridiculous than were our ancestors in their
      knee-breeches, pig-tail and chapeau de bras. In fact we are really
      more absurd. If a fashionably dressed man of to-day could catch a single
      glimpse of himself through the eyes of his descendants four or five
      generations removed, he would have a strong impression of being something
      that had escaped from somewhere.
    
    
      Whatever strides we may have made in arts and sciences, we have made no
      advance in the matter of costume. That Americans do not tattoo themselves,
      and do go fully clad&mdash;I am speaking exclusively of my own sex&mdash;is
      about all that can be said in favor of our present fashions. I wish I had
      the vocabulary of Herr Teufelsdrockh with which to inveigh against the
      dress-coat of our evening parties, the angular swallow-tailed coat that
      makes a man look like a poor species of bird and gets him mistaken for the
      waiter. "As long as a man wears the modern coat," says Leigh Hunt, "he has
      no right to despise any dress. What snips at the collar and lapels! What a
      mechanical and ridiculous cut about the flaps! What buttons in front that
      are never meant to button, and yet are no ornament! And what an
      exquisitely absurd pair of buttons at the back! gravely regarded,
      nevertheless, and thought as indispensably necessary to every
      well-conditioned coat, as other bits of metal or bone are to the bodies of
      savages whom we laugh at. There is absolutely not one iota of sense,
      grace, or even economy in the modern coat."
    
    
      Still more deplorable is the ceremonial hat of the period. That a
      Christian can go about unabashed with a shiny black cylinder on his head
      shows what civilization has done for us in the way of taste in personal
      decoration. The scalplock of an Apache brave has more style. When an
      Indian squaw comes into a frontier settlement the first "marked-down"
      article she purchases is a section of stove-pipe. Her instinct as to the
      eternal fitness of things tells her that its proper place is on the skull
      of a barbarian.
    
    
      It was while revolving these pleasing reflections in my mind, that our
      friend Delorme walked across the stage in the fourth act, and though there
      was nothing in the situation nor in the text of the play to warrant it, I
      broke into tremendous applause, from which I desisted only at the scowl of
      an usher&mdash;an object in a celluloid collar and a claw-hammer coat. My
      solitary ovation to Master Delorme was an involuntary and, I think,
      pardonable protest against the male costume of our own time.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      ON A CERTAIN AFFECTATION
    
    
      EXCEPTING on the ground that youth is the age of vain fantasy, there is no
      accounting for the fact that young men and young women of poetical
      temperament should so frequently assume to look upon an early demise for
      themselves as the most desirable thing in the world. Though one may
      incidentally be tempted to agree with them in the abstract, one cannot
      help wondering. That persons who are exceptionally fortunate in their
      environment, and in private do not pretend to be otherwise, should openly
      announce their intention of retiring at once into the family tomb, is a
      problem not easily solved. The public has so long listened to these
      funereal solos that if a few of the poets thus impatient to be gone were
      to go, their departure would perhaps be attended by that resigned speeding
      which the proverb invokes on behalf of the parting guest.
    
    
      The existence of at least one magazine editor would, I know, have a shadow
      lifted from it. At this writing, in a small mortuary basket under his desk
      are seven or eight poems of so gloomy a nature that he would not be able
      to remain in the same room with them if he did not suspect the integrity
      of their pessimism. The ring of a false coin is not more recognizable than
      that of a rhyme setting forth a simulated sorrow.
    
    
      The Miss Gladys who sends a poem entitled "Forsaken," in which she
      addresses death as her only friend, makes pictures in the editor's eyes.
      He sees, among other dissolving views, a little hoyden in magnificent
      spirits, perhaps one of this season's social buds, with half a score of
      lovers ready to pluck her from the family stem&mdash;a rose whose
      countless petals are coupons. A caramel has disagreed with her, or she
      would not have written in this despondent vein. The young man who seeks to
      inform the world in eleven anaemic stanzas of terze rime that the
      cup of happiness has been forever dashed from his lip (he appears to have
      but one) and darkly intimates that the end is "nigh" (rhyming affably with
      "sigh"), will probably be engaged a quarter of a century from now in
      making similar declarations. He is simply echoing some dysthymic poet of
      the past&mdash;reaching out with some other man's hat for the stray nickel
      of your sympathy.
    
    
      This morbidness seldom accompanies genuine poetic gifts. The case of David
      Gray, the young Scottish poet who died in 1861, is an instance to the
      contrary. His lot was exceedingly sad, and the failure of health just as
      he was on the verge of achieving something like success justified his
      profound melancholy; but that he tuned this melancholy and played upon it,
      as if it were a musical instrument, is plainly seen in one of his sonnets.
    
    
      In Monckton Milnes's (Lord Houghton's) "Life and Letters of John Keats" it
      is related that Keats, one day, on finding a stain of blood upon his lips
      after coughing, said to his friend Charles Brown: "I know the color of
      that blood; it is arterial blood; I cannot be deceived. That drop is my
      death-warrant. I must die." Who that ever read the passage could forget
      it? David Gray did not, for he versified the incident as happening to
      himself and appropriated, as his own, Keats's comment:
    

     Last night, on coughing slightly with sharp pain,
     There came arterial blood, and with a sigh
     Of absolute grief I cried in bitter vein,
     That drop is my death-warrant; I must die.

    
      The incident was likely enough a personal experience, but the comment
      should have been placed in quotation marks. I know of few stranger things
      in literature than this poet's dramatization of another man's pathos. Even
      Keats's epitaph&mdash;Here lies one whose name was writ in water&mdash;finds
      an echo in David Gray's Below lies one whose name was traced in sand.
      Poor Gray was at least the better prophet.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      WISHMAKERS' TOWN
    
    
      A LIMITED edition of this little volume of verse, which seems to me in
      many respects unique, was issued in 1885, and has long been out of print.
      The reissue of the book is in response to the desire off certain readers
      who have not forgotten the charm which William Young's poem exercised upon
      them years ago, and, finding the charm still potent, would have others
      share it.
    
    
      The scheme of the poem, for it is a poem and not simply a series of
      unrelated lyrics, is ingenious and original, and unfolds itself in
      measures at once strong and delicate. The mood of the poet and the method
      of the playwright are obvious throughout. Wishmakers' Town&mdash;a little
      town situated in the no-man's-land of "The Tempest" and "A Midsummer
      Night's Dream"&mdash;is shown to us as it awakens, touched by the dawn.
      The clangor of bells far and near calls the townfolk to their various
      avocations, the toiler to his toil, the idler to his idleness, the miser
      to his gold. In swift and picturesque sequence the personages of the
      Masque pass before us. Merchants, hucksters, players, lovers, gossips,
      soldiers, vagabonds, and princes crowd the scene, and have in turn their
      word of poignant speech. We mingle with the throng in the streets; we hear
      the whir of looms and the din of foundries, the blare of trumpets, the
      whisper of lovers, the scandals of the market-place, and, in brief, are
      let into all the secrets of the busy microcosm. A contracted stage,
      indeed, yet large enough for the play of many passions, as the narrowest
      hearthstone may be. With the sounding of the curfew, the town is hushed to
      sleep again, and the curtain falls on this mimic drama of life.
    
    
      The charm of it all is not easily to be defined. Perhaps if one could name
      it, the spell were broken. Above the changing rhythms hangs an atmosphere
      too evasive for measurement&mdash;an atmosphere that stipulates an
      imaginative mood on the part of the reader. The quality which pleases in
      certain of the lyrical episodes is less intangible. One readily explains
      one's liking for so gracious a lyric as The Flower-Seller, to select an
      example at random. Next to the pleasure that lies in the writing of such
      exquisite verse is the pleasure of quoting it. I copy the stanzas partly
      for my own gratification, and partly to win the reader to "Wishmakers'
      Town," not knowing better how to do it.
    

     Myrtle, and eglantine,
     For the old love and the new!
     And the columbine,
     With its cap and bells, for folly!
     And the daffodil, for the hopes of youth! and the rue,
     For melancholy!
     But of all the blossoms that blow,
     Fair gallants all, I charge you to win, if ye may,
     This gentle guest,
     Who dreams apart, in her wimple of purple and gray,
     Like the blessed Virgin, with meek head bending low
     Upon her breast.
     For the orange flower
     Ye may buy as ye will: but the violet of the wood
     Is the love of maidenhood;
     And he that hath worn it but once, though but for an hour,
     He shall never again, though he wander by many a stream,
     No, never again shall he meet with a dower that shall seem
     So sweet and pure; and forever, in after years,
     At the thought of its bloom, or the fragrance of its breath,
     The past shall arise,
     And his eyes shall be dim with tears,
     And his soul shall be far in the gardens of Paradise
     Though he stand in the Shambles of death.
In a different tone, but displaying the same sureness of execution, is
the cry of the lowly folk, the wretched pawns in the great game of life:

     Prince, and Bishop, and Knight, and Dame,
     Plot, and plunder, and disagree!
     O but the game is a royal game!
     O but your tourneys are fair to see!

     None too hopeful we found our lives;
     Sore was labor from day to day;
     Still we strove for our babes and wives&mdash;
     Now, to the trumpet, we march away!

     "Why?"&mdash;For some one hath will'd it so!
     Nothing we know of the why or the where&mdash;
     To swamp, or jungle, or wastes of snow&mdash;
     Nothing we know, and little we care.

     Give us to kill!&mdash;since this is the end
     Of love and labor in Nature's plan;
     Give us to kill and ravish and rend,
     Yea, since this is the end of man.

     States shall perish, and states be born:
     Leaders, out of the throng, shall press;
     Some to honor, and some to scorn:
     We, that are little, shall yet be less.

     Over our lines shall the vultures soar;
     Hard on our flanks shall the jackals cry;
     And the dead shall be as the sands of the shore;
     And daily the living shall pray to die.

     Nay, what matter!&mdash;When all is said,
     Prince and Bishop will plunder still:
     Lord and Lady must dance and wed.
     Pity us, pray for us, ye that will!

    
      It is only the fear of impinging on Mr. Young's copyright that prevents me
      reprinting the graphic ballad of The Wanderer and the prologue of The
      Strollers, which reads like a page from the prelude to some Old-World
      miracle play. The setting of these things is frequently antique, but the
      thought is the thought of today. I think there is a new generation of
      readers for such poetry as Mr. Young's. I venture the prophecy that it
      will not lack for them later when the time comes for the inevitable
      rearrangement of present poetic values.
    
    
      The author of "Wishmakers' Town" is the child of his period, and has not
      escaped the maladie du siecle. The doubt and pessimism that marked
      the end of the nineteenth century find a voice in the bell-like strophes
      with which the volume closes. It is the dramatist rather than the poet who
      speaks here. The real message of the poet to mankind is ever one of hope.
      Amid the problems that perplex and discourage, it is for him to sing
    

     Of what the world shall be
     When the years have died away.

    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      HISTORICAL NOVELS
    
    
      IN default of such an admirable piece of work as Dr. Weir Mitchell's "Hugh
      Wynne," I like best those fictions which deal with kingdoms and
      principalities that exist only in the mind's eye. One's knowledge of
      actual events and real personages runs no serious risk of receiving shocks
      in this no-man's-land. Everything that happens in an imaginary realm&mdash;in
      the realm of Ruritania, for illustration&mdash;has an air of possibility,
      at least a shadowy vraisemblance. The atmosphere and local color, having
      an authenticity of their own, are not to be challenged. You cannot charge
      the writer with ignorance of the period in which his narrative is laid,
      since the period is as vague as the geography. He walks on safe ground,
      eluding many of the perils that beset the story-teller who ventures to
      stray beyond the bounds of the make-believe. One peril he cannot escape&mdash;that
      of misrepresenting human nature.
    
    
      The anachronisms of the average historical novel, pretending to reflect
      history, are among its minor defects. It is a thing altogether wonderfully
      and fearfully made&mdash;the imbecile intrigue, the cast-iron characters,
      the plumed and armored dialogue with its lance of gory rhetoric forever at
      charge. The stage at its worst moments is not so unreal. Here art has
      broken into smithereens the mirror which she is supposed to hold up to
      nature.
    
    
      In this romance-world somebody is always somebody's unsuspected father,
      mother, or child, deceiving every one excepting the reader. Usually the
      anonymous person is the hero, to whom it is mere recreation to hold twenty
      swordsmen at bay on a staircase, killing ten or twelve of them before he
      escapes through a door that ever providentially opens directly behind him.
      How tired one gets of that door! The "caitiff" in these chronicles of when
      knighthood was in flower is invariably hanged from "the highest
      battlement"&mdash;the second highest would not do at all; or else he is
      thrown into "the deepest dungeon of the castle"&mdash;the second deepest
      dungeon was never known to be used on these occasions. The hero habitually
      "cleaves" his foeman "to the midriff," the "midriff" being what the
      properly brought up hero always has in view. A certain fictional historian
      of my acquaintance makes his swashbuckler exclaim: "My sword will [shall]
      kiss his midriff;" but that is an exceptionally lofty flight of diction.
      My friend's heroine dresses as a page, and in the course of long
      interviews with her lover remains unrecognized&mdash;a diaphanous literary
      invention that must have been old when the Pyramids were young. The
      heroine's small brother, with playful archaicism called "a springald,"
      puts on her skirts and things and passes himself off for his sister or
      anybody else he pleases. In brief, there is no puerility that is not at
      home in this sphere of misbegotten effort. Listen&mdash;a priest, a
      princess, and a young man in woman's clothes are on the scene:
    

     \          The princess rose to her feet and
     approached the priest.
     \          "Father," she said swiftly, "this
     is not the Lady Joan, my brother's
     wife, but a youth marvelously like
     her, who hath offered himself in
     her place that she might escape. . . .
     He is the Count von Loen, a lord
     of Kernsburg.  And I love him.  We
     want you to marry us now, dear
     Father&mdash;now, without a moment's
     delay; for if you do not they will
     kill him, and I shall have to marry
     Prince Wasp!"

    
      This is from "Joan of the Sword Hand," and if ever I read a more silly
      performance I have forgotten it.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      POOR YORICK
    
    
      THERE is extant in the city of New York an odd piece of bric-a-brac which
      I am sometimes tempted to wish was in my own possession. On a bracket in
      Edwin Booth's bedroom at The Players&mdash;the apartment remains as he
      left it that solemn June day ten years ago&mdash;stands a sadly
      dilapidated skull which the elder Booth, and afterward his son Edwin, used
      to soliloquize over in the graveyard at Elsinore in the fifth act of
      "Hamlet."
    
    
      A skull is an object that always invokes interest more or less poignant;
      it always has its pathetic story, whether told or untold; but this skull
      is especially a skull "with a past."
    
    
      In the early forties, while playing an engagement somewhere in the wild
      West, Junius Brutus Booth did a series of kindnesses to a particularly
      undeserving fellow, the name of him unknown to us. The man, as it seemed,
      was a combination of gambler, horse-stealer, and highwayman&mdash;in
      brief, a miscellaneous desperado, and precisely the melodramatic sort of
      person likely to touch the sympathies of the half-mad player. In the
      course of nature or the law, presumably the law, the adventurer bodily
      disappeared one day, and soon ceased to exist even as a reminiscence in
      the florid mind of his sometime benefactor.
    
    
      As the elder Booth was seated at breakfast one morning in a hotel in
      Louisville, Kentucky, a negro boy entered the room bearing a small osier
      basket neatly covered with a snowy napkin. It had the general appearance
      of a basket of fruit or flowers sent by some admirer, and as such it
      figured for a moment in Mr. Booth's conjecture. On lifting the cloth the
      actor started from the chair with a genuine expression on his features of
      that terror which he was used so marvelously to simulate as Richard III.
      in the midnight tent-scene or as Macbeth when the ghost of Banquo usurped
      his seat at table.
    
    
      In the pretty willow-woven basket lay the head of Booth's old pensioner,
      which head the old pensioner had bequeathed in due legal form to the
      tragedian, begging him henceforth to adopt it as one of the necessary
      stage properties in the fifth act of Mr. Shakespeare's tragedy of
      "Hamlet." "Take it away, you black imp!" thundered the actor to the
      equally aghast negro boy, whose curiosity had happily not prompted him to
      investigate the dark nature of his burden.
    
    
      Shortly afterward, however, the horse-stealer's residuary legatee,
      recovering from the first shock of his surprise, fell into the grim humor
      of the situation, and proceeded to carry out to the letter the testator's
      whimsical request. Thus it was that the skull came to secure an engagement
      to play the role of poor Yorick in J. B. Booth's company of strolling
      players, and to continue a while longer to glimmer behind the footlights
      in the hands of his famous son.
    
    
      Observing that the grave-digger in his too eager realism was damaging the
      thing&mdash;the marks of his pick and spade are visible on the cranium&mdash;Edwin
      Booth presently replaced it with a papier-mache counterfeit manufactured
      in the property-room of the theatre. During his subsequent wanderings in
      Australia and California, he carefully preserved the relic, which finally
      found repose on the bracket in question.
    
    
      How often have I sat, of an afternoon, in that front room on the fourth
      floor of the clubhouse in Gramercy Park, watching the winter or summer
      twilight gradually softening and blurring the sharp outline of the skull
      until it vanished uncannily into the gloom! Edwin Booth had forgotten, if
      ever he knew, the name of the man; but I had no need of it in order to
      establish acquaintance with poor Yorick. In this association I was
      conscious of a deep tinge of sentiment on my own part, a circumstance not
      without its queerness, considering how very distant the acquaintance
      really was.
    
    
      Possibly he was a fellow of infinite jest in his day; he was sober enough
      now, and in no way disposed to indulge in those flashes of merriment "that
      were wont to set the table on a roar." But I did not regret his evaporated
      hilarity; I liked his more befitting genial silence, and had learned to
      look upon his rather open countenance with the same friendliness as that
      with which I regarded the faces of less phantasmal members of the club. He
      had become to me a dramatic personality as distinct as that of any of the
      Thespians I met in the grillroom or the library.
    
    
      Yorick's feeling in regard to me was a subject upon which I frequently
      speculated. There was at intervals an alert gleam of intelligence in those
      cavernous eye-sockets, as if the sudden remembrance of some old experience
      had illumined them. He had been a great traveler, and had known strange
      vicissitudes in life; his stage career had brought him into contact with a
      varied assortment of men and women, and extended his horizon. His more
      peaceful profession of holding up mail-coaches on lonely roads had surely
      not been without incident. It was inconceivable that all this had left no
      impressions. He must have had at least a faint recollection of the
      tempestuous Junius Brutus Booth. That Yorick had formed his estimate of
      me, and probably not a flattering one, is something of which I am strongly
      convinced.
    
    
      At the death of Edwin Booth, poor Yorick passed out of my personal
      cognizance, and now lingers an incongruous shadow amid the memories of the
      precious things I lost then.
    
    
      The suite of apartments formerly occupied by Edwin Booth at The Players
      has been, as I have said, kept unchanged&mdash;a shrine to which from time
      to time some loving heart makes silent pilgrimage. On a table in the
      centre of his bedroom lies the book just where he laid it down, an ivory
      paper-cutter marking the page his eyes last rested upon; and in this
      chamber, with its familiar pictures, pipes, and ornaments, the skull finds
      its proper sanctuary. If at odd moments I wish that by chance poor Yorick
      had fallen to my care, the wish is only halfhearted, though had that
      happened, I would have given him welcome to the choicest corner in my
      study and tenderly cherished him for the sake of one who comes no more.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      THE AUTOGRAPH HUNTER
    

     One that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!
     &mdash;King Lear.

    
      THE material for this paper on the autograph hunter, his ways and his
      manners, has been drawn chiefly from experiences not my own. My personal
      relations with him have been comparatively restricted, a circumstance to
      which I owe the privilege of treating the subject with a freedom that
      might otherwise not seem becoming.
    
    
      No author is insensible to the compliment involved in a request for his
      autograph, assuming the request to come from some sincere lover of books
      and bookmen. It is an affair of different complection when he is
      importuned to give time and attention to the innumerable unknown who
      "collect" autographs as they would collect postage stamps, with no
      interest in the matter beyond the desire to accumulate as many as
      possible. The average autograph hunter, with his purposeless insistence,
      reminds one of the queen in Stockton's story whose fad was "the
      buttonholes of all nations."
    
    
      In our population of eighty millions and upward there are probably two
      hundred thousand persons interested more or less in what is termed the
      literary world. This estimate is absurdly low, but it serves to cast a
      sufficient side-light upon the situation. Now, any unit of these two
      hundred thousand is likely at any moment to indite a letter to some
      favorite novelist, historian, poet, or what not. It will be seen, then,
      that the autograph hunter is no inconsiderable person. He has made it
      embarrassing work for the author fortunate or unfortunate enough to be
      regarded as worth while. Every mail adds to his reproachful pile of
      unanswered letters. If he have a conscience, and no amanuensis, he quickly
      finds himself tangled in the meshes of endless and futile correspondence.
      Through policy, good nature, or vanity he is apt to become facile prey.
    
    
      A certain literary collector once confessed in print that he always
      studied the idiosyncrasies of his "subject" as carefully as another sort
      of collector studies the plan of the house to which he meditates a
      midnight visit. We were assured that with skillful preparation and adroit
      approach an autograph could be extracted from anybody. According to the
      revelations of the writer, Bismarck, Queen Victoria, and Mr. Gladstone had
      their respective point of easy access&mdash;their one unfastened door or
      window, metaphorically speaking. The strongest man has his weak side.
    
    
      Dr. Holmes's affability in replying to every one who wrote to him was
      perhaps not a trait characteristic of the elder group. Mr. Lowell, for
      instance, was harder-hearted and rather difficult to reach. I recall one
      day in the library at Elmwood. As I was taking down a volume from the
      shelf a sealed letter escaped from the pages and fluttered to my feet. I
      handed it to Mr. Lowell, who glanced incuriously at the superscription.
      "Oh, yes," he said, smiling, "I know 'em by instinct." Relieved of its
      envelope, the missive turned out to be eighteen months old, and began with
      the usual amusing solecism: "As one of the most famous of American authors
      I would like to possess your autograph."
    
    
      Each recipient of such requests has of course his own way of responding.
      Mr. Whittier used to be obliging; Mr. Longfellow politic; Mr. Emerson,
      always philosophical, dreamily confiscated the postage stamps.
    
    
      Time was when the collector contented himself with a signature on a card;
      but that, I am told, no longer satisfies. He must have a letter addressed
      to him personally&mdash;"on any subject you please," as an immature scribe
      lately suggested to an acquaintance of mine. The ingenuous youth purposed
      to flourish a letter in the faces of his less fortunate competitors, in
      order to show them that he was on familiar terms with the celebrated
      So-and-So. This or a kindred motive is the spur to many a collector. The
      stratagems he employs to compass his end are inexhaustible. He drops you
      an off-hand note to inquire in what year you first published your
      beautiful poem entitled "A Psalm of Life." If you are a simple soul, you
      hasten to assure him that you are not the author of that poem, which he
      must have confused with your "Rime of the Ancient Mariner"&mdash;and there
      you are. Another expedient is to ask if your father's middle name was not
      Hierophilus. Now, your father has probably been dead many years, and as
      perhaps he was not a public man in his day, you are naturally touched that
      any one should have interest in him after this long flight of time. In the
      innocence of your heart you reply by the next mail that your father's
      middle name was not Hierophilus, but Epaminondas&mdash;and there you are
      again. It is humiliating to be caught swinging, like a simian ancestor, on
      a branch of one's genealogical tree.
    
    
      Some morning you find beside your plate at breakfast an imposing parchment
      with a great gold seal in the upper left-hand corner. This document&mdash;I
      am relating an actual occurrence&mdash;announces with a flourish that you
      have unanimously been elected an honorary member of The Kalamazoo
      International Literary Association. Possibly the honor does not take away
      your respiration; but you are bound by courtesy to make an acknowledgment,
      and you express your insincere thanks to the obliging secretary of a
      literary organization which does not exist anywhere on earth.
    
    
      A scheme of lighter creative touch is that of the correspondent who
      advises you that he is replenishing his library and desires a detailed
      list of your works, with the respective dates of their first issue, price,
      style of binding, etc. A bibliophile, you say to yourself. These
      interrogations should of course have been addressed to your publisher; but
      they are addressed to you, with the stereotyped "thanks in advance." The
      natural inference is that the correspondent, who writes in a brisk
      commercial vein, wishes to fill out his collection of your books, or,
      possibly, to treat himself to a complete set in full crushed Levant. Eight
      or ten months later this individual, having forgotten (or hoping you will
      not remember) that he has already demanded a chronological list of your
      writings, forwards another application couched in the self-same words. The
      length of time it takes him to "replenish" his library (with your books)
      strikes you as pathetic. You cannot control your emotions sufficiently to
      pen a reply. From a purely literary point of view this gentleman cares
      nothing whatever for your holograph; from a mercantile point of view he
      cares greatly and likes to obtain duplicate specimens, which he disposes
      of to dealers in such frail merchandise.
    
    
      The pseudo-journalist who is engaged in preparing a critical and
      biographical sketch of you, and wants to incorporate, if possible, some
      slight hitherto unnoted event in your life&mdash;a signed photograph and a
      copy of your bookplate are here in order&mdash;is also a character which
      periodically appears upon the scene. In this little Comedy of Deceptions
      there are as many players as men have fancies.
    
    
      A brother slave-of-the-lamp permits me to transfer this leaf from the book
      of his experience: "Not long ago the postman brought me a letter of a
      rather touching kind. The unknown writer, lately a widow, and plainly a
      woman of refinement, had just suffered a new affliction in the loss of her
      little girl. My correspondent asked me to copy for her ten or a dozen
      lines from a poem which I had written years before on the death of a
      child. The request was so shrinkingly put, with such an appealing air of
      doubt as to its being heeded, that I immediately transcribed the entire
      poem, a matter of a hundred lines or so, and sent it to her. I am unable
      to this day to decide whether I was wholly hurt or wholly amused when, two
      months afterward, I stumbled over my manuscript, with a neat price
      attached to it, in a second-hand bookshop."
    
    
      Perhaps the most distressing feature of the whole business is the very
      poor health which seems to prevail among autograph hunters. No other class
      of persons in the community shows so large a percentage of confirmed
      invalids. There certainly is some mysterious connection between incipient
      spinal trouble and the collecting of autographs. Which superinduces the
      other is a question for pathology. It is a fact that one out of every
      eight applicants for a specimen of penmanship bases his or her claim upon
      the possession of some vertebral disability which leaves him or her
      incapable of doing anything but write to authors for their autograph. Why
      this particular diversion should be the sole resource remains undisclosed.
      But so it appears to be, and the appeal to one's sympathy is most direct
      and persuasive. Personally, however, I have my suspicions, suspicions that
      are shared by several men of letters, who have come to regard this plea of
      invalidism, in the majority of cases, as simply the variation of a very
      old and familiar tune. I firmly believe that the health of autograph
      hunters, as a class, is excellent.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      ROBERT HERRICK
    
    
      I
    
    
      A LITTLE over three hundred years ago England had given to her a poet of
      the very rarest lyrical quality, but she did not discover the fact for
      more than a hundred and fifty years afterward. The poet himself was aware
      of the fact at once, and stated it, perhaps not too modestly, in countless
      quatrains and couplets, which were not read, or, if read, were not much
      regarded at the moment. It has always been an incredulous world in this
      matter. So many poets have announced their arrival, and not arrived!
    
    
      Robert Herrick was descended in a direct line from an ancient family in
      Lincolnshire, the Eyricks, a mentionable representative of which was John
      Eyrick of Leicester, the poet's grandfather, admitted freeman in 1535, and
      afterward twice made mayor of the town. John Eyrick or Heyricke&mdash;he
      spelled his name recklessly&mdash;had five sons, the second of which
      sought a career in London, where he became a goldsmith, and in December,
      1582, married Julian Stone, spinster, of Bedfordshire, a sister to Anne,
      Lady Soame, the wife of Sir Stephen Soame. One of the many children of
      this marriage was Robert Herrick.
    
    
      It is the common misfortune of the poet's biographers, though it was the
      poet's own great good fortune, that the personal interviewer was an
      unknown quantity at the period when Herrick played his part on the stage
      of life. Of that performance, in its intimate aspects, we have only the
      slightest record.
    
    
      Robert Herrick was born in Wood street, Cheapside, London, in 1591, and
      baptized at St. Vedast's, Foster Lane, on August 24 of that year. He had
      several brothers and sisters, with whom we shall not concern ourselves. It
      would be idle to add the little we know about these persons to the little
      we know about Herrick himself. He is a sufficient problem without dragging
      in the rest of the family.
    
    
      When the future lyrist was fifteen months old his father, Nicholas
      Herrick, made his will, and immediately fell out of an upper window.
      Whether or not this fall was an intended sequence to the will, the high
      almoner, Dr. Fletcher, Bishop of Bristol, promptly put in his claim to the
      estate, "all goods and chattels of suicides" becoming his by law. The
      circumstances were suspicious, though not conclusive, and the good bishop,
      after long litigation, consented to refer the case to arbitrators, who
      awarded him two hundred and twenty pounds, thus leaving the question at
      issue&mdash;whether or not Herrick's death had been his own premeditated
      act&mdash;still wrapped in its original mystery. This singular law, which
      had the possible effect of inducing high almoners to encourage suicide
      among well-to-do persons of the lower and middle classes, was afterward
      rescinded.
    
    
      Nicholas Herrick did not leave his household destitute, for his estate
      amounted to five thousand pounds, that is to say, twenty-five thousand
      pounds in to-day's money; but there were many mouths to feed. The poet's
      two uncles, Robert Herrick and William Herrick of Beaumanor, the latter
      subsequently knighted (1) for his usefulness as jeweller and money-lender
      to James I., were appointed guardians to the children.
    

     (1) Dr. Grosart, in his interesting and valuable Memorial
     Introduction to Herrick's poems, quotes this curious item
     from Win-wood's Manorials of Affairs of State: "On Easter
     Tuesday 1605, one Mr. William Herrick, a goldsmith in
     Cheapside, was Knighted for making a Hole in the great
     Diamond the King cloth wear.  The party little expected the
     honour, but he did his work so well as won the King to an
     extraordinary liking of it."

    
      Young Robert appears to have attended school in Westminster until his
      fifteenth year, when he was apprenticed to Sir William, who had learned
      the gentle art of goldsmith from his nephew's father. Though Robert's
      indentures bound him for ten years, Sir William is supposed to have
      offered no remonstrance when he was asked, long before that term expired,
      to cancel the engagement and allow Robert to enter Cambridge, which he did
      as fellow-commoner at St. John's College. At the end of two years he
      transferred himself to Trinity Hall, with a view to economy and the
      pursuit of the law&mdash;the two frequently go together. He received his
      degree of B. A. in 1617, and his M. A. in 1620, having relinquished the
      law for the arts.
    
    
      During this time he was assumed to be in receipt of a quarterly allowance
      of ten pounds&mdash;a not illiberal provision, the pound being then five
      times its present value; but as the payments were eccentric, the master of
      arts was in recurrent distress. If this money came from his own share of
      his father's estate, as seems likely, Herrick had cause for complaint; if
      otherwise, the pith is taken out of his grievance.
    
    
      The Iliad of his financial woes at this juncture is told in a few
      chance-preserved letters written to his "most careful uncle," as he calls
      that evidently thrifty person. In one of these monotonous and dreary
      epistles, which are signed "R. Hearick," the writer says: "The essence of
      my writing is (as heretofore) to entreat you to paye for my use to Mr.
      Arthour Johnson, bookseller, in Paule's Churchyarde, the ordinarie sume of
      tenn pounds, and that with as much sceleritie as you maye." He also
      indulges in the natural wish that his college bills "had leaden wings and
      tortice feet." This was in 1617. The young man's patrimony, whatever it
      may have been, had dwindled, and he confesses to "many a throe and pinches
      of the purse." For the moment, at least, his prospects were not
      flattering.
    
    
      Robert Herrick's means of livelihood, when in 1620 he quitted the
      university and went up to London, are conjectural. It is clear that he was
      not without some resources, since he did not starve to death on his wits
      before he discovered a patron in the Earl of Pembroke. In the court circle
      Herrick also unearthed humbler, but perhaps not less useful, allies in the
      persons of Edward Norgate, clerk of the signet, and Master John Crofts,
      cup-bearer to the king. Through the two New Year anthems, honored by the
      music of Henry Lawes, his Majesty's organist at Westminster, it is more
      than possible that Herrick was brought to the personal notice of Charles
      and Henrietta Maria. All this was a promise of success, but not success
      itself. It has been thought probable that Herrick may have secured some
      minor office in the chapel at Whitehall. That would accord with his
      subsequent appointment (September, 1627,) as chaplain to the Duke of
      Buckingham's unfortunate expedition of the Isle of Rhe.
    
    
      Precisely when Herrick was invested with holy orders is not ascertainable.
      If one may draw an inference from his poems, the life he led meanwhile was
      not such as his "most careful uncle" would have warmly approved. The
      literary clubs and coffee-houses of the day were open to a free-lance like
      young Herrick, some of whose blithe measures, passing in manuscript from
      hand to hand, had brought him faintly to light as a poet. The Dog and the
      Triple Tun were not places devoted to worship, unless it were to the
      worship of "rare Ben Jonson," at whose feet Herrick now sat, with the
      other blossoming young poets of the season. He was a faithful disciple to
      the end, and addressed many loving lyrics to the master, of which not the
      least graceful is His Prayer to Ben Jonson:
    

     When I a verse shall make,
     Know I have praid thee
     For old religion's sake,
     Saint Ben, to aide me.

     Make the way smooth for me,
     When I, thy Herrick,
     Honouring thee, on my knee
     Offer my lyric.

     Candles I'll give to thee,
     And a new altar;
     And thou, Saint Ben, shalt be
     Writ in my Psalter.

    
      On September 30, 1629, Charles I., at the recommending of the Earl of
      Exeter, presented Herrick with the vicarage of Dean Prior, near Totnes, in
      Devonshire. Here he was destined to pass the next nineteen years of his
      life among surroundings not congenial. For Herrick to be a mile away from
      London stone was for Herrick to be in exile. Even with railway and
      telegraphic interruptions from the outside world, the dullness of a
      provincial English town of today is something formidable. The dullness of
      a sequestered English hamlet in the early part of the seventeenth century
      must have been appalling. One is dimly conscious of a belated throb of
      sympathy for Robert Herrick. Yet, however discontented or unhappy he may
      have been at first in that lonely vicarage, the world may congratulate
      itself on the circumstances that stranded him there, far from the
      distractions of the town, and with no other solace than his Muse, for
      there it was he wrote the greater number of the poems which were to make
      his fame. It is to this accidental banishment to Devon that we owe the
      cluster of exquisite pieces descriptive of obsolete rural manners and
      customs&mdash;the Christmas masks, the Twelfth-night mummeries, the
      morris-dances, and the May-day festivals.
    
    
      The November following Herrick's appointment to the benefice was marked by
      the death of his mother, who left him no heavier legacy than "a ringe of
      twenty shillings." Perhaps this was an understood arrangement between
      them; but it is to be observed that, though Herrick was a spendthrift in
      epitaphs, he wasted no funeral lines on Julian Herrick. In the matter of
      verse he dealt generously with his family down to the latest nephew. One
      of his most charming and touching poems is entitled To His Dying Brother,
      Master William Herrick, a posthumous son. There appear to have been two
      brothers named William. The younger, who died early, is supposed to be
      referred to here.
    
    
      The story of Herrick's existence at Dean Prior is as vague and bare of
      detail as the rest of the narrative. His parochial duties must have been
      irksome to him, and it is to be imagined that he wore his cassock lightly.
      As a preparation for ecclesiastical life he forswore sack and poetry; but
      presently he was with the Muse again, and his farewell to sack was in a
      strictly Pickwickian sense. Herrick had probably accepted the vicarship as
      he would have accepted a lieutenancy in a troop of horse&mdash;with an eye
      to present emolument and future promotion. The promotion never came, and
      the emolument was nearly as scant as that of Goldsmith's parson, who
      considered himself "passing rich with forty pounds a year"&mdash;a height
      of optimism beyond the reach of Herrick, with his expensive town wants and
      habits. But fifty pounds&mdash;the salary of his benefice&mdash;and
      possible perquisites in the way of marriage and burial fees would enable
      him to live for the time being. It was better than a possible nothing a
      year in London.
    
    
      Herrick's religious convictions were assuredly not deeper than those of
      the average layman. Various writers have taken a different view of the
      subject; but it is inconceivable that a clergyman with a fitting sense of
      his function could have written certain of the poems which Herrick
      afterward gave to the world&mdash;those astonishing epigrams upon his
      rustic enemies, and those habitual bridal compliments which, among his
      personal friends, must have added a terror to matrimony. Had he written
      only in that vein, the posterity which he so often invoked with pathetic
      confidence would not have greatly troubled itself about him.
    
    
      It cannot positively be asserted that all the verses in question relate to
      the period of his incumbency, for none of his verse is dated, with the
      exception of the Dialogue betwixt Horace and Lydia. The date of some of
      the compositions may be arrived at by induction. The religious pieces
      grouped under the title of Noble Numbers distinctly associate themselves
      with Dean Prior, and have little other interest. Very few of them are
      "born of the royal blood." They lack the inspiration and magic of his
      secular poetry, and are frequently so fantastical and grotesque as to stir
      a suspicion touching the absolute soundness of Herrick's mind at all
      times. The lines in which the Supreme Being is assured that he may read
      Herrick's poems without taking any tincture from their sinfulness might
      have been written in a retreat for the unbalanced. "For unconscious
      impiety," remarks Mr. Edmund Gosse, (1) "this rivals the famous passage in
      which Robert Montgomery exhorted God to 'pause and think.'" Elsewhere, in
      an apostrophe to "Heaven," Herrick says:
    

     Let mercy be
     So kind to set me free,
     And I will straight
     Come in, or force the gate.

    
      In any event, the poet did not purpose to be left out!
    

     (1) In Seventeenth-Century Studies. and the general
     absence of arrangement in the "Hesperides," Dr. Grosart
     advances the theory that the printers exercised arbitrary
     authority on these points.  Dr. Grosart assumes that Herrick
     kept the epigrams and personal tributes in manuscript books
     separate from the rest of the work, which would have made a
     too slender volume by itself, and on the plea of this
     slender-ness was induced to trust the two collections to the
     publisher, "whereupon he or some un-skilled subordinate
     proceeded to intermix these additions with the others.  That
     the poet him-self had nothing to do with the arrangement or
     disarrangement lies on the surface."  This is an amiable
     supposition, but merely a supposition.

    
      Relative to the inclusion of unworthy pieces, Herrick personally placed
      the "copy" in the hands of John Williams and Francis Eglesfield, and if he
      were over-persuaded to allow them to print unfit verses, and to observe no
      method whatever in the contents of the book, the discredit is none the
      less his. It is charitable to believe that Herrick's coarseness was not
      the coarseness of the man, but of the time, and that he followed the
      fashion malgre lui. With regard to the fairy poems, they certainly
      should have been given in sequence; but if there are careless printers,
      there are also authors who are careless in the arrangement of their
      manuscript, a kind of task, moreover, in which Herrick was wholly
      unpractised, and might easily have made mistakes. The "Hesperides" was his
      sole publication.
    
    
      Herrick was now thirty-eight years of age. Of his personal appearance at
      this time we have no description. The portrait of him prefixed to the
      original edition of his works belongs to a much later moment. Whether or
      not the bovine features in Marshall's engraving are a libel on the poet,
      it is to be regretted that oblivion has not laid its erasing finger on
      that singularly unpleasant counterfeit presentment. It is interesting to
      note that this same Marshall engraved the head of Milton for the first
      collection of his miscellaneous poems&mdash;the precious 1645 volume
      containing Il Penseroso, Lycidas, Comus, etc. The plate gave great offense
      to the serious-minded young Milton, not only because it represented him as
      an elderly person, but because of certain minute figures of peasant lads
      and lassies who are very indistinctly seen dancing frivolously under the
      trees in the background. Herrick had more reason to protest. The
      aggressive face bestowed upon him by the artist lends a tone of veracity
      to the tradition that the vicar occasionally hurled the manuscript of his
      sermon at the heads of his drowsy parishioners, accompanying the missive
      with pregnant remarks. He has the aspect of one meditating assault and
      battery.
    
    
      To offset the picture there is much indirect testimony to the amiability
      of the man, aside from the evidence furnished by his own writings. He
      exhibits a fine trait in the poem on the Bishop of Lincoln's imprisonment&mdash;a
      poem full of deference and tenderness for a person who had evidently
      injured the writer, probably by opposing him in some affair of church
      preferment. Anthony Wood says that Herrick "became much beloved by the
      gentry in these parts for his florid and witty (wise) discourses." It
      appears that he was fond of animals, and had a pet spaniel called Tracy,
      which did not get away without a couplet attached to him:
    

     Now thou art dead, no eye shall ever see
     For shape and service spaniell like to thee.

    
      Among the exile's chance acquaintances was a sparrow, whose elegy he also
      sings, comparing the bird to Lesbia's sparrow, much to the latter's
      disadvantage. All of Herrick's geese were swans. On the authority of
      Dorothy King, the daughter of a woman who served Herrick's successor at
      Dean Prior in 1674, we are told that the poet kept a pig, which he had
      taught to drink out of a tankard&mdash;a kind of instruction he was
      admirably qualified to impart. Dorothy was in her ninety-ninth year when
      she communicated this fact to Mr. Barron Field, the author of the paper on
      Herrick published in the "Quarterly Review" for August, 1810, and in the
      Boston edition (1) of the "Hesperides" attributed to Southey.
    

     (1) The Biographical Notice prefacing this volume of The
     British Poets is a remarkable production, grammatically and
     chronologi-cally.  On page 7 the writer speaks of Herrick as
     living "in habits of intimacy" with Ben Jonson in 1648.  If
     that was the case, Her-rick must have taken up his quarters
     in Westminster Abbey, for Jonson had been dead eleven years.

    
      What else do we know of the vicar? A very favorite theme with Herrick was
      Herrick. Scattered through his book are no fewer than twenty-five pieces
      entitled On Himself, not to mention numberless autobiographical hints
      under other captions. They are merely hints, throwing casual side-lights
      on his likes and dislikes, and illuminating his vanity. A whimsical
      personage without any very definite outlines might be evolved from these
      fragments. I picture him as a sort of Samuel Pepys, with perhaps less
      quaintness, and the poetical temperament added. Like the prince of
      gossips, too, he somehow gets at your affections. In one place Herrick
      laments the threatened failure of his eyesight (quite in what would have
      been Pepys's manner had Pepys written verse), and in another place he
      tells us of the loss of a finger. The quatrain treating of this latter
      catastrophe is as fantastic as some of Dr. Donne's concetti:
    

     One of the five straight branches of my hand
     Is lopt already, and the rest but stand
     Expecting when to fall, which soon will be:
     First dies the leafe, the bough next, next the tree.

    
      With all his great show of candor Herrick really reveals as little of
      himself as ever poet did. One thing, however, is manifest&mdash;he
      understood and loved music. None but a lover could have said:
    

     The mellow touch of musick most doth wound
     The soule when it doth rather sigh than sound.

    
      Or this to Julia:
    

     So smooth, so sweet, so silvery is thy voice,
     As could they hear, the damn'd would make no noise,
     But listen to thee walking in thy chamber
     Melting melodious words to lutes of amber.

     . . . Then let me lye
     Entranc'd, and lost confusedly;
     And by thy musick stricken mute,
     Die, and be turn'd into a lute.

    
      Herrick never married. His modest Devonshire establishment was managed by
      a maidservant named Prudence Baldwin. "Fate likes fine names," says
      Lowell. That of Herrick's maid-of-all-work was certainly a happy meeting
      of gentle vowels and consonants, and has had the good fortune to be
      embalmed in the amber of what may be called a joyous little threnody:
    

     In this little urne is laid
     Prewdence Baldwin, once my maid;
     From whose happy spark here let
     Spring the purple violet.

    
      Herrick addressed a number of poems to her before her death, which seems
      to have deeply touched him in his loneliness. We shall not allow a
      pleasing illusion to be disturbed by the flippancy of an old writer who
      says that "Prue was but indifferently qualified to be a tenth muse." She
      was a faithful handmaid, and had the merit of causing Herrick in this
      octave to strike a note of sincerity not usual with him:
    

     These summer birds did with thy master stay
     The times of warmth, but then they flew away,
     Leaving their poet, being now grown old,
     Expos'd to all the coming winter's cold.
     But thou, kind Prew, didst with my fates abide
     As well the winter's as the summer's tide:
     For which thy love, live with thy master here
     Not two, but all the seasons of the year.

    
      Thus much have I done for thy memory, Mistress Prew!
    
    
      In spite of Herrick's disparagement of Deanbourn, which he calls "a rude
      river," and his characterization of Devon folk as "a people currish,
      churlish as the seas," the fullest and pleasantest days of his life were
      probably spent at Dean Prior. He was not unmindful meanwhile of the
      gathering political storm that was to shake England to its foundations.
      How anxiously, in his solitude, he watched the course of events, is
      attested by many of his poems. This solitude was not without its
      compensation. "I confess," he says,
    

     I ne'er invented such
     Ennobled numbers for the presse
     Than where I loath'd so much.

    
      A man is never wholly unhappy when he is writing verses. Herrick was
      firmly convinced that each new lyric was a stone added to the pillar of
      his fame, and perhaps his sense of relief was tinged with indefinable
      regret when he found himself suddenly deprived of his benefice. The
      integrity of some of his royalistic poems is doubtful; but he was not
      given the benefit of the doubt by the Long Parliament, which ejected the
      panegyrist of young Prince Charles from the vicarage of Dean Prior, and
      installed in his place the venerable John Syms, a gentleman with
      pronounced Cromwellian views.
    
    
      Herrick metaphorically snapped his fingers at the Puritans, discarded his
      clerical habiliments, and hastened to London to pick up such as were left
      of the gay-colored threads of his old experience there. Once more he would
      drink sack at the Triple Tun, once more he would breathe the air breathed
      by such poets and wits as Cotton, Denham, Shirley, Selden, and the rest.
      "Yes, by Saint Anne! and ginger shall be hot I' the mouth too." In the
      gladness of getting back "from the dull confines of the drooping west," he
      writes a glowing apostrophe to London&mdash;that "stony stepmother to
      poets." He claims to be a free-born Roman, and is proud to find himself a
      citizen again. According to his earlier biographers, Herrick had much ado
      not to starve in that same longed-for London, and fell into great misery;
      but Dr. Grosart disputes this, arguing, with justness, that Herrick's
      family, which was wealthy and influential, would not have allowed him to
      come to abject want. With his royalistic tendencies he may not have
      breathed quite freely in the atmosphere of the Commonwealth, and no doubt
      many tribulations fell to his lot, but among them was not poverty.
    
    
      The poet was now engaged in preparing his works for the press, and a few
      weeks following his return to London they were issued in a single volume
      with the title "Hesperides; or, The Works both Humane and Divine of Robert
      Herrick, Esq."
    
    
      The time was not ready for him. A new era had dawned&mdash;the era of the
      commonplace. The interval was come when Shakespeare himself was to lie in
      a kind of twilight. Herrick was in spirit an Elizabethan, and had strayed
      by chance into an artificial and prosaic age&mdash;a sylvan singing
      creature alighting on an alien planet. "He was too natural," says Mr.
      Palgrave in his Chrysomela, "too purely poetical; he had not the learned
      polish, the political allusion, the tone of the city, the didactic turn,
      which were then and onward demanded from poetry." Yet it is strange that a
      public which had a relish for Edmund Waller should neglect a poet who was
      fifty times finer than Waller in his own specialty. What poet then, or in
      the half-century that followed the Restoration, could have written
      Corinna's Going a-Maying, or approached in kind the ineffable grace and
      perfection to be found in a score of Herrick's lyrics?
    
    
      The "Hesperides" was received with chilling indifference. None of
      Herrick's great contemporaries has left a consecrating word concerning it.
      The book was not reprinted during the author's lifetime, and for more than
      a century after his death Herrick was virtually unread. In 1796 the
      "Gentleman's Magazine" copied a few of the poems, and two years later Dr.
      Nathan Drake published in his "Literary Hours" three critical papers on
      the poet, with specimens of his writings. Dr. Johnson omitted him from the
      "Lives of the Poets," though space was found for half a score of
      poetasters whose names are to be found nowhere else. In 1810 Dr. Nott, a
      physician of Bristol, issued a small volume of selections. It was not
      until 1823 that Herrick was reprinted in full. It remained for the taste
      of our own day to multiply editions of him.
    
    
      In order to set the seal to Herrick's fame, it is now only needful that
      some wiseacre should attribute the authorship of the poems to some man who
      could not possibly have written a line of them. The opportunity presents
      attractions that ought to be irresistible. Excepting a handful of
      Herrick's college letters there is no scrap of his manuscript extant; the
      men who drank and jested with the poet at the Dog or the Triple Tun make
      no reference to him; (1) and in the wide parenthesis formed by his birth
      and death we find as little tangible incident as is discoverable in the
      briefer span of Shakespeare's fifty-two years. Here is material for
      profundity and ciphers!
    

     (1) With the single exception of the writer of some verses
     in the Musarum Deliciae (1656) who mentions

     That old sack
     Young Herrick took to entertain
     The Muses in a sprightly vein.

    
      Herrick's second sojourn in London covered the period between 1648 and
      1662, curing which interim he fades from sight, excepting for the instant
      when he is publishing his book. If he engaged in further literary work
      there are no evidences of it beyond one contribution to the "Lacrymae
      Musarum" in 1649.
    
    
      He seems to have had lodgings, for a while at least, in St. Anne's,
      Westminster. With the court in exile and the grim Roundheads seated in the
      seats of the mighty, it was no longer the merry London of his early
      manhood. Time and war had thinned the ranks of friends; in the old haunts
      the old familiar faces were wanting. Ben Jonson was dead, Waller banished,
      and many another comrade "in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes." As
      Herrick walked through crowded Cheapside or along the dingy river-bank in
      those years, his thought must have turned more than once to the little
      vicarage in Devonshire, and lingered tenderly.
    
    
      On the accession of Charles II. a favorable change of wind wafted Herrick
      back to his former moorings at Dean Prior, the obnoxious Syms having been
      turned adrift. This occurred on August 24, 1662, the seventy-first
      anniversary of the poet's baptism. Of Herrick's movements after that,
      tradition does not furnish even the shadow of an outline. The only notable
      event concerning him is recorded twelve years later in the parish
      register: "Robert Herrick, vicker, was buried ye 15th day October, 1674."
      He was eighty-three years old. The location of his grave is unknown. In
      1857 a monument to his memory was erected in Dean Church. And this is all.
    
    
      II
    
    
      THE details that have come down to us touching Herrick's private life are
      as meagre as if he had been a Marlowe or a Shakespeare. But were they as
      ample as could be desired they would still be unimportant compared with
      the single fact that in 1648 he gave to the world his "Hesperides." The
      environments of the man were accidental and transitory. The significant
      part of him we have, and that is enduring so long as wit, fancy, and
      melodious numbers hold a charm for mankind.
    
    
      A fine thing incomparably said instantly becomes familiar, and has
      henceforth a sort of dateless excellence. Though it may have been said
      three hundred years ago, it is as modern as yesterday; though it may have
      been said yesterday, it has the trick of seeming to have been always in
      our keeping. This quality of remoteness and nearness belongs, in a
      striking degree, to Herrick's poems. They are as novel to-day as they were
      on the lips of a choice few of his contemporaries, who, in reading them in
      their freshness, must surely have been aware here and there of the ageless
      grace of old idyllic poets dead and gone.
    
    
      Herrick was the bearer of no heavy message to the world, and such message
      as he had he was apparently in no hurry to deliver. On this point he
      somewhere says:
    

     Let others to the printing presse run fast;
     Since after death comes glory, I 'll not haste.

    
      He had need of his patience, for he was long detained on the road by many
      of those obstacles that waylay poets on their journeys to the printer.
    
    
      Herrick was nearly sixty years old when he published the "Hesperides." It
      was, I repeat, no heavy message, and the bearer was left an unconscionable
      time to cool his heels in the antechamber. Though his pieces had been set
      to music by such composers as Lawes, Ramsay, and Laniers, and his court
      poems had naturally won favor with the Cavalier party, Herrick cut but a
      small figure at the side of several of his rhyming contemporaries who are
      now forgotten. It sometimes happens that the light love-song, reaching few
      or no ears at its first singing, outlasts the seemingly more prosperous
      ode which, dealing with some passing phase of thought, social or
      political, gains the instant applause of the multitude. In most cases the
      timely ode is somehow apt to fade with the circumstance that inspired it,
      and becomes the yesterday's editorial of literature. Oblivion likes
      especially to get hold of occasional poems. That makes it hard for feeble
      poets laureate.
    
    
      Mr. Henry James once characterized Alphonse Daudet as "a great little
      novelist." Robert Herrick is a great little poet. The brevity of his
      poems, for he wrote nothing de longue haleine, would place him
      among the minor singers; his workmanship places him among the masters. The
      Herricks were not a family of goldsmiths and lapidaries for nothing. The
      accurate touch of the artificer in jewels and costly metals was one of the
      gifts transmitted to Robert Herrick. Much of his work is as exquisite and
      precise as the chasing on a dagger-hilt by Cellini; the line has nearly
      always that vine-like fluency which seems impromptu, and is never the
      result of anything but austere labor. The critic who, borrowing Milton's
      words, described these carefully wrought poems as "wood-notes wild" showed
      a singular lapse of penetration. They are full of subtle simplicity. Here
      we come across a stanza as severely cut as an antique cameo&mdash;the
      stanza, for instance, in which the poet speaks of his lady-love's "winter
      face"&mdash;and there a couplet that breaks into unfading daffodils and
      violets. The art, though invisible, is always there. His amatory songs and
      catches are such poetry as Orlando would have liked to hang on the boughs
      in the forest of Arden. None of the work is hastily done, not even that
      portion of it we could wish had not been done at all. Be the motive grave
      or gay, it is given that faultlessness of form which distinguishes
      everything in literature that has survived its own period. There is no
      such thing as "form" alone; it is only the close-grained material that
      takes the highest finish. The structure of Herrick's verse, like that of
      Blake, is simple to the verge of innocence. Such rhythmic intricacies as
      those of Shelley, Tennyson, and Swinburne he never dreamed of. But his
      manner has this perfection: it fits his matter as the cup of the acorn
      fits its meat.
    
    
      Of passion, in the deeper sense, Herrick has little or none. Here are no
      "tears from the depth of some divine despair," no probings into the tragic
      heart of man, no insight that goes much farther than the pathos of a
      cowslip on a maiden's grave. The tendrils of his verse reach up to the
      light, and love the warmer side of the garden wall. But the reader who
      does not detect the seriousness under the lightness misreads Herrick.
      Nearly all true poets have been wholesome and joyous singers. A
      pessimistic poet, like the poisonous ivy, is one of nature's sarcasms. In
      his own bright pastoral way Herrick must always remain unexcelled. His
      limitations are certainly narrow, but they leave him in the sunshine.
      Neither in his thought nor in his utterance is there any complexity; both
      are as pellucid as a woodland pond, content to duplicate the osiers and
      ferns, and, by chance, the face of a girl straying near its crystal. His
      is no troubled stream in which large trout are caught. He must be accepted
      on his own terms.
    
    
      The greatest poets have, with rare exceptions, been the most indebted to
      their predecessors or to their contemporaries. It has wittily been
      remarked that only mediocrity is ever wholly original. Impressionability
      is one of the conditions of the creative faculty: the sensitive mind is
      the only mind that invents. What the poet reads, sees, and feels, goes
      into his blood, and becomes an ingredient of his originality. The color of
      his thought instinctively blends itself with the color of its affinities.
      A writer's style, if it have distinction, is the outcome of a hundred
      styles.
    
    
      Though a generous borrower of the ancients, Herrick appears to have been
      exceptionally free from the influence of contemporary minds. Here and
      there in his work are traces of his beloved Ben Jonson, or fleeting
      impressions of Fletcher, and in one instance a direct infringement on
      Suckling; but the sum of Herrick's obligations of this sort is
      inconsiderable.
    
    
      This indifference to other writers of his time, this insularity, was
      doubtless his loss. The more exalted imagination of Vaughan or Marvell or
      Herbert might have taught him a deeper note than he sounded in his purely
      devotional poems. Milton, of course, moved in a sphere apart. Shakespeare,
      whose personality still haunted the clubs and taverns which Herrick
      frequented on his first going up to London, failed to lay any appreciable
      spell upon him. That great name, moreover, is a jewel which finds no
      setting in Herrick's rhyme. His general reticence relative to brother
      poets is extremely curious when we reflect on his penchant for addressing
      four-line epics to this or that individual. They were, in the main,
      obscure individuals, whose identity is scarcely worth establishing. His
      London life, at two different periods, brought him into contact with many
      of the celebrities of the day; but his verse has helped to confer
      immortality on very few of them. That his verse had the secret of
      conferring immortality was one of his unshaken convictions. Shakespeare
      had not a finer confidence when he wrote,
    

     Not marble nor the gilded monuments
     Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,

    
      than has Herrick whenever he speaks of his own poetry, and he is not by
      any means backward in speaking of it. It was the breath of his nostrils.
      Without his Muse those nineteen years in that dull, secluded Devonshire
      village would have been unendurable.
    
    
      His poetry has the value and the defect of that seclusion. In spite,
      however, of his contracted horizon there is great variety in Herrick's
      themes. Their scope cannot be stated so happily as he has stated it:
    

     I sing of brooks, of blossoms, birds and bowers,
     Of April, May, of June, and July flowers;
     I sing of May-poles, hock-carts, wassails, wakes,
     Of bridegrooms, brides, and of their bridal-cakes;
     I write of Youth, of Love, and have access
     By these to sing of cleanly wantonness;
     I sing of dews, of rains, and piece by piece
     Of balm, of oil, of spice and ambergris;
     I sing of times trans-shifting, and I write
     How roses first came red and lilies white;
     I write of groves, of twilights, and I sing
     The Court of Mab, and of the Fairy King;
     I write of Hell; I sing (and ever shall)
     Of Heaven, and hope to have it after all.

    
      Never was there so pretty a table of contents! When you open his book the
      breath of the English rural year fans your cheek; the pages seem to exhale
      wildwood and meadow smells, as if sprigs of tansy and lavender had been
      shut up in the volume and forgotten. One has a sense of hawthorn hedges
      and wide-spreading oaks, of open lead-set lattices half hidden with
      honeysuckle; and distant voices of the haymakers, returning home in the
      rosy afterglow, fall dreamily on one's ear, as sounds should fall when
      fancy listens. There is no English poet so thoroughly English as Herrick.
      He painted the country life of his own time as no other has painted it at
      any time.
    
    
      It is to be remarked that the majority of English poets regarded as
      national have sought their chief inspiration in almost every land and
      period excepting their own. Shakespeare went to Italy, Denmark, Greece,
      Egypt, and to many a hitherto unfooted region of the imagination, for plot
      and character. It was not Whitehall Garden, but the Garden of Eden and the
      celestial spaces, that lured Milton. It is the Ode on a Grecian Urn, The
      Eve of St. Agnes, and the noble fragment of Hyperion that have given Keats
      his spacious niche in the gallery of England's poets. Shelley's two
      masterpieces, Prometheus Unbound and The Cenci, belong respectively to
      Greece and Italy. Browning's The Ring and the Book is Italian; Tennyson
      wandered to the land of myth for the Idylls of the King, and Matthew
      Arnold's Sohrab and Rustum&mdash;a narrative poem second in dignity to
      none produced in the nineteenth century&mdash;is a Persian story. But
      Herrick's "golden apples" sprang from the soil in his own day, and
      reddened in the mist and sunshine of his native island.
    
    
      Even the fairy poems, which must be classed by themselves, are not wanting
      in local flavor. Herrick's fairy world is an immeasurable distance from
      that of "A Midsummer Night's Dream." Puck and Titania are of finer breath
      than Herrick's little folk, who may be said to have Devonshire manners and
      to live in a miniature England of their own. Like the magician who summons
      them from nowhere, they are fond of color and perfume and substantial
      feasts, and indulge in heavy draughts&mdash;from the cups of
      morning-glories. In the tiny sphere they inhabit everything is marvelously
      adapted to their requirement; nothing is out of proportion or out of
      perspective. The elves are a strictly religious people in their winsome
      way, "part pagan, part papistical;" they have their pardons and
      indulgences, their psalters and chapels, and
    

     An apple's-core is hung up dried,
     With rattling kernels, which is rung
     To call to Morn and Even-song;

    
      and very conveniently,
    

     Hard by, I' th' shell of half a nut,
     The Holy-water there is put.

    
      It is all delightfully naive and fanciful, this elfin-world, where the
      impossible does not strike one as incongruous, and the England of 1648
      seems never very far away.
    
    
      It is only among the apparently unpremeditated lyrical flights of the
      Elizabethan dramatists that one meets with anything like the lilt and
      liquid flow of Herrick's songs. While in no degree Shakespearian echoes,
      there are epithalamia and dirges of his that might properly have fallen
      from the lips of Posthumus in "Cymbeline." This delicate epicede would
      have fitted Imogen:
    

     Here a solemne fast we keepe
     While all beauty lyes asleepe;
     Husht be all things; no noyse here
     But the toning of a teare,
     Or a sigh of such as bring
     Cowslips for her covering.

    
      Many of the pieces are purely dramatic in essence; the Mad Maid's Song,
      for example. The lyrist may speak in character, like the dramatist. A
      poet's lyrics may be, as most of Browning's are, just so many dramatis
      personae. "Enter a Song singing" is the stage-direction in a
      seventeenth-century play whose name escapes me. The sentiment dramatized
      in a lyric is not necessarily a personal expression. In one of his
      couplets Herrick neatly denies that his more mercurial utterances are
      intended presentations of himself:
    

     To his Book's end this last line he'd have placed&mdash;
     Jocund his Muse was, but his Life was chaste.

    
      In point of fact he was a whole group of imaginary lovers in one. Silvia,
      Anthea, Electra, Perilla, Perenna, and the rest of those lively ladies
      ending in a, were doubtless, for the most part, but airy phantoms
      dancing&mdash;as they should not have danced&mdash;through the brain of a
      sentimental old bachelor who happened to be a vicar of the Church of
      England. Even with his overplus of heart it would have been quite
      impossible for him to have had enough to go round had there been so
      numerous actual demands upon it.
    
    
      Thus much may be conceded to Herrick's verse: at its best it has wings
      that carry it nearly as close to heaven's gate as any of Shakespeare's
      lark-like interludes. The brevity of the poems and their uniform
      smoothness sometimes produce the effect of monotony. The crowded richness
      of the line advises a desultory reading. But one must go back to them
      again and again. They bewitch the memory, having once caught it, and
      insist on saying themselves over and over. Among the poets of England the
      author of the "Hesperides" remains, and is likely to remain, unique. As
      Shakespeare stands alone in his vast domain, so Herrick stands alone in
      his scanty plot of ground.
    
    
      "Shine, Poet! in thy place, and be content."

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
