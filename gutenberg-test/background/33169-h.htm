<h2>HARRY BORDEN'S NAVAL MONSTER.</h2>

<h3>BY W.&nbsp;J. HENDERSON.</h3>

<p>It was a bright and beautiful morning in June, 1927. The war between
Venezuela and England had been in progress just three weeks, and every
one was wondering why the big monarchy had not whipped the little
republic off the face of the earth. But the resources of the South
American country had been underestimated, and so had the immense
difficulties which confronted England in her endeavor to carry on an
offensive war at an almost inaccessible distance from her most
trustworthy sources of supplies, and in a climate which was formidable
to her men. She had succeeded in landing a small force of trained
soldiers, fresh from her latest campaign against the Ameer of
Afghanistan, who had set up a new boundary-line beyond Herat, and was
consequently in hot water with both England and Russia.</p>

<p>These trained Indian curry-eaters had penetrated a vast forest in the
interior and had never come out, and it was currently reported that half
of them had perished in a swamp, and the other half had been destroyed
by fevers and cobras. A strong fleet, under command of Vice-Admiral<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1026" id="Page_1026">[Pg 1026]</a></span> Sir
Wallace Bruce, had been scattered by adverse winds, and two of the ships
had fallen in with powerful Venezuelan armor-clads, and had been most
impertinently sent to the bottom. Others had sunk three Venezuelan
war-ships, but the little republic had three better ones afloat inside
of a week, and experts said that they looked very French.</p>

<p>The war had broken out over England's high-handed occupation of an
insignificant island off the Venezuelan coast. The Venezuelans had been
amazed by the proceeding, but the Marquis of Wintergreen, the Foreign
Secretary, had at once declared that the island had been conquered and
attached to England by Sir Francis Drake in the course of his first
voyage to the West Indies. As Mr. Froude and other English historians
had proved that Drake was little better than a pirate, this made every
one laugh, except the Venezuelans, who said they were going to fight;
and they did. As soon as war was declared, President Roosevelt, of the
United States, on the advice of Secretary of State George B. McClellan,
Jun., called an extra session of Congress, and the legislative halls at
Washington so rang with patriotic speeches about the Monroe Doctrine
that the New York <i>Sun</i> got out extras every two hours, day and night,
and had illuminated bulletins covering the entire front of the building.
Congress at length declared that the United States must act as an ally
of Venezuela, whereupon the <i>Sun</i> printed itself in red, white, and
blue, and the <i>World</i> despatched correspondents by special balloon to
South America. The President ordered the entire National Guard into the
service of the United States, and the various regiments at once repaired
to their camps of instruction and began field drills. It was expected
that they would be fully equipped and prepared for service at the front
in about two months. The naval militia was also ordered out, and
immediately began a series of cruises alongshore in open boats, landing
and sending signals in every direction every four hours. The officers
clamored for coast-defense vessels to man, but there were only four such
ships, and they were all in dry docks undergoing repairs that would take
three months to complete. The Secretary of the Navy issued orders to
Rear-Admiral Ward to get the North and South Atlantic squadrons to the
Venezuelan coast as quickly as possible, and the Rear-Admiral answered
that he would be ready to sail by the end of August.</p>

<p>As soon as the action of Congress had been taken, Harry Borden, of
Tickle River, went by express train to Washington. In the obscure
sea-coast village of Tickle River Harry was called a genius, and it was
said that he had invented things which would be worth millions to the
government in such an emergency as that which had now arisen. It was to
lay before the Secretary of War one of these inventions that the young
man had gone to the capital. He had exhibited a small working model of
his contrivance to several wealthy men of his native State, and they had
forthwith invested enough money in it to enable the young inventor to
build a full-fledged machine, and to go to see the Secretary about its
employment in the impending conflict. Harry Borden was a good talker,
but he could not talk the government of the United States into prompt
action.</p>

<p>"My dear young friend," said the Secretary, "I am sure that your
invention will prove of inestimable value to the United States in time
of war."</p>

<p>"It's the time of war now, isn't it?" said Harry.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, to be sure; but this is a matter which must be laid before
Congress, and a bill must be introduced regarding it. I should advise
you to see the Congressman from your district about that. I will give
you a letter to him saving that I heartily approve of your machine."</p>

<p>"But, sir, while all this is going on we are losing valuable time. My
machine ought to be down there damaging the enemy."</p>

<p>"Really, my dear young friend, you must allow things to take their
course."</p>

<p>"Why can't you give me permission to go ahead on my own hook?"</p>

<p>"Embark in private warfare? Privateering is out of date, my young
friend. But, ah&mdash;um&mdash;I may say that&mdash;ah&mdash;if you should go down there and
succeed in inflicting serious damage on the British fleet, I
think&mdash;mind, I say only that I think&mdash;the government would ignore the
irregularity of the proceeding."</p>

<p>"That's enough for me," said Harry, springing to his feet. "If my
backers will consent, I'll be there in less than a week; and, mark my
word, sir, you'll hear of my machine down there, sir."</p>

<p>And before the astonished Secretary could say more, Harry Borden had
bounded from the room.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>The British cruiser <i>Ajax III.</i> was steaming at a speed of ten knots
through the blue waters of the Caribbean Sea. She had been carrying
certain despatches of grave importance from Vice-Admiral Sir Wallace
Bruce to the Governor of Jamaica, and was now returning in a leisurely
manner, which told of economy in the coal department. The <i>Ajax III.</i>
was an armored cruiser of about 6000 tons. She carried armor eight
inches thick on her sides, and had a steel protective deck four inches
thick. Her main battery consisted of four improved Smith-Dodge-Hopkins
8-inch rapid-firing breech-loaders, capable of discharging four of the
new steel-iridium conical projectiles every minute, with a point-blank
range of two miles, and an initial velocity of 3000 feet per second. Her
secondary battery consisted of six 4-inch revolving guns, discharging
seventy shells a minute when operated by electricity. The cruiser had
the new compound quintuple engines, capable of driving her twenty-six
knots an hour under forced draught. On the whole, she was regarded as a
fairly efficient vessel, though some of the leading British critics
declared that she belonged to a type that was fast becoming obsolete.</p>

<p>She was moving gently and steadily through the water. The sun was
shining brightly, and his gleaming rays made sparkling light along the
cruiser's polished brass-work and on the brown chases of her long
slender guns. Captain Dudley Fawkes was pacing the after-bridge in
conversation with his Executive Officer, Commander Bilton-Brooks, and
Lieutenant Sir Edward Avon was the officer of the watch on the main
bridge.</p>

<p>"I don't believe," said Captain Fawkes, "that the United States means
seriously to take a hand in this light."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," responded Commander Bilton-Brooks. "Congress
has taken action, and the President has called out troops."</p>

<p>"True enough," rejoined the Captain, "but that does not necessarily mean
anything. You know the navy must be the aggressive force, and we have
yet to see an American ship afloat in these waters."</p>

<p>"That is quite true," said the Executive Officer; "yet, for the life of
me, I can't help feeling that there is mischief of some sort in the
air."</p>

<p>The Executive Officer's words were more nearly correct than even he
suspected, for at that very instant the two lookouts in the foretop were
puzzling their eyes and brains to make out a strange object which had
appeared on the lee beam. While they were watching it, it dropped from
the air, where it had seemed to be floating, and rested on the bosom of
the sea, where it presently resolved itself into a cutter-yacht some
sixty feet in length.</p>

<p>"It were a bloomin' mirage, Bill," said one lookout to the other, as he
lifted his voice and bawled, "Sail, ho!"</p>

<p>"Where away?" came the quick demand from the bridge.</p>

<p>"On our lee beam, sir," answered the man. "Looks like a cutter-yacht,
sir."</p>

<p>Now in the year 1927 a cutter-yacht was something of a curiosity, for
electricity had supplanted sail-power for small craft, and vessels
propelled by canvas were rare indeed. The cutter-yacht seen from the
decks of the <i>Ajax III.</i> was on the port tack, close hauled and heading
so as to intercept the cruiser's course, provided she had speed enough,
which was wholly unlikely. She was under full canvas, and though the
breeze was very light, she slipped through the smooth water at an
amazing speed. This fact dawned on the minds of the Captain and his
Executive Officer at the same time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1027" id="Page_1027">[Pg 1027]</a></span></p>

<p>"She must have an auxiliary electric screw," said Commander
Bilton-Brooks.</p>

<p>"I fancy so," said the Captain. "Owned by some fellow who likes to think
he's sailing, but has no patience with light breezes. It's rather
curious, though, that he should be cruising in these waters at a time
like this, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It certainly is," answered the Executive Officer. "I don't see any
flag&mdash;do you, sir?"</p>

<p>"No. I rather fancy I shall have to overhaul this yacht, and make her
skipper give an account of her. There's a mysterious air about her that
I don't half like."</p>

<p>But it was a good deal easier to talk about overhauling the cutter than
it was to do it. The yacht's sails, which were made of some extremely
light material, like Chinese silk in appearance, were drawing
powerfully, and her electric motor&mdash;if it really was electric&mdash;was doing
astounding work. The yacht flashed through the water like some great
fish, and so fine were her lines that she left hardly a bubble in her
wake. The Captain of the <i>Ajax III.</i> gave orders to increase the speed
of the cruiser, and presently the quick throbbing of her engines and the
vibrations of her hull told that she was tearing across the long swells
at a 25-knot speed. But still the cutter-yacht flew along, and it was
evident that she would pass across the cruiser's bow if both held their
courses.</p>

<p>"We must stop her lively skipping," said Captain Dudley Fawkes, and he
gave orders to sound the call to quarters. The bugle rang out, and the
hearty British tars jumped to their stations.</p>

<p>"Cast loose and provide!" ordered Commander Bilton-Brooks.</p>

<p>The ammunition hoists slipped noiselessly upward bearing the
steel-iridium shells for the 8-inch guns, and the electric chains hauled
up the 70-pounders for the secondary battery. In forty-five seconds the
ship was ready to fight, and the order was given to train all forward
guns on the cutter and stand by for orders. Then the Captain and his
Executive Officer turned their glasses once more on the cutter.</p>

<p>"What on earth is she up to now?" exclaimed the Captain.</p>

<p>"Taking in sail&mdash;and spars, too!" cried Commander Bilton-Brooks.</p>

<p>It was true. Not only had the strange cutter let all her thin sails run
down, but she seemed to have folded up her mast, boom, gaff, and
bowsprit in some strange way and stowed them out of sight.</p>

<p>"Has she shown any flag yet?" asked the Captain.</p>

<p>"None that I have seen," answered the Executive Officer.</p>

<p>"Then I'll wager a month's pay that she's some Yankee invention,"
declared Captain Dudley Fawkes.</p>

<p>"What in the world are they doing now?" said the Executive Officer.</p>

<p>A strange misshapen mass was rising above the bulwarks of the cutter
with surprising swiftness.</p>

<p>"It's a balloon!" exclaimed the Captain.</p>

<p>"Hadn't we better open fire on her?" asked the Executive Officer.</p>

<p>"Not yet. I think we'd better get close enough to hail her first,"
answered the Captain. "She may not be anything more than a pleasure
craft, you know."</p>

<p>The balloon was inflated by this time, and was tugging at the heavy
steel hawsers by which it was attached to the cutter's hull. A cry of
surprise broke from the crew of the British cruiser.</p>

<p>"Look! look! She's going up!"</p>

<p>The great balloon, inflated with the newly discovered gas, mercurite,
the lightest and most powerful of all known gases, was lifting the
cutter bodily into the air. Her curiously shaped hull, modelled after a
shark's body, and equipped with a fin-keel for sailing on the wind, was
now fully revealed. At the same instant a United States ensign was waved
over her stern by a young man.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cortis," called the Captain, who had not thought it necessary yet
to enter the conning-tower, "give him a taste of your metal."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir," answered the Lieutenant in command of the forward 8-inch
guns.</p>

<p>The next instant there was a terrific concussion, and one of the big
shells went screaming toward the cutter: but she was rising so fast that
the projectile passed under her, and plunged foaming into the sea a mile
away.</p>

<p>"More elevation, sir," cried the Executive Officer.</p>

<p>"Impossible!" answered Lieutenant Cortis: "we're too close to her, and
the angle is too high."</p>

<p>"Look at her now!" exclaimed the Captain. "She's rushing toward us!"</p>

<p>"Sailing against the wind with a balloon!" cried Commander
Bilton-Brooks.</p>

<p>The shark-bodied cutter, with her fin-keel below and her balloon above,
was indeed now moving toward a position above the cruiser.</p>

<p>"Call away the riflemen!" cried the Captain.</p>

<p>The red-coated marines assembled on the superstructures, and began a
rapid fire at the balloon, hoping to burst it. But their bullets simply
glanced off the fine steel netting with which it was protected. Now the
head of the young man once again appeared above the bulwarks of the
strange machine, and he took a rapid glance at the British ship. The
next instant a small port in the cutter's side opened, and from it
dropped a glass globe about half the size of a football. The globe fell
upon the forward deck of the cruiser. There was an appalling explosion,
and the whole forecastle of the <i>Ajax III.</i> became a hopeless wreck.
Another globe was hurled with such fatal accuracy that it fell down one
of the smoke-stacks of the now helpless vessel. There was a roar as of
thunder away down in her engine-room, and pale-faced men poured on deck.</p>

<p>"We're sinking! The ship's bottom is blown out!" they cried. There was a
wild rush to lower away the boats. A few minutes later the <i>Ajax III.</i>
sank out of sight under the fine waters of the Caribbean Sea, and Harry
Borden, with his balloon stowed and his canvas spread again, was sailing
away with a few survivors of the ill-fated cruiser in his strange
invention in search of more British cruisers. A month later the war was
over.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BILBERRY_SCHOOL_EXHIBITION" id="THE_BILBERRY_SCHOOL_EXHIBITION"></a>THE BILBERRY SCHOOL EXHIBITION.</h2>

<h3>BY SOPHIE SWETT.</h3>

<p>Simpsy Judkins was to "speak a piece," and Viola Treddick to read an
original composition; there was to be a glee sung by picked voices from
the first class&mdash;it was all about the deep blue sky, and "the sky, the
sky, the sky," was repeated in a very thrilling and effective manner;
and Tom Burtis was to display his powers as a lightning calculator. The
exhibition was to be given in the new Town-hall, and not only would all
Bilberry be there, but a crowd of people from the adjacent towns as
well, to say nothing of teachers and pupils from the Normal School at
Cocheco; for the Bilberry Hill School exhibitions had acquired a
reputation.</p>

<p>In the Treddick family the girls had been obliged to take the family
burden upon their shoulders. When Father Treddick died, somewhat less
than a month after Mother Treddick, turning his face to the wall, and
saying that she had been his backbone and his underpinning and he
couldn't live without her (it sometimes happens that way in spite of
Mother Nature), the rocks still had the upper hands on the little farm,
and Amasa, the only boy, was but eleven. Lizette, who was fifteen, went
to work in the stocking factory. Every one thought it was a pity,
because Lizette was fond of books and had meant to be a teacher; she was
slight and delicate, too, and work in the stocking factory was hard. But
Lizette believed in doing "not what ye would, but what you may," with
just as good a will as if it were the former. Some people said she had
taken warning by her father's example; he had always been trying to
invent something in his queer little workshop that was the wood-shed
chamber; that was why the rocks had not been gotten out of the farm.</p>

<p>It was Viola who was now spoken of as a remarkably fine scholar, just as
Lizette had been before she went into the factory; she was not yet
sixteen, but she hoped to get the Pine Bank School to teach in
September. There were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1028" id="Page_1028">[Pg 1028]</a></span> several other candidates, all older than she, but
Viola was at the head of her class, and that original composition which
she was to read at the exhibition was expected to make an impression
upon the committee-men. The teacher had said to several people that it
was really a remarkable production for a girl of Viola's age, and they
thought a great deal of literary gifts in Bilberry.</p>

<p>Lizette was very proud of Viola, and so, indeed, was Amasa, who was
fourteen now, but whose name was not on the programme at all. To tell
the painful truth at once, although Amasa keenly felt the especial need
there was that he should be "smart," although he tried his best to be
the man of the family in a satisfactory sense, yet he was at the very
foot of his class; fractions floored him, and he had a hazy idea that
Timbuctoo was out West, and that Captain John Smith discovered America.
When it came to chopping wood, Amasa was pretty sure to cut his toe, and
if he went fishing he tumbled into the pond. And he couldn't get "jobs,"
like Cosy Pringle, the boy in the next house, who had money in the bank.</p>

<p>Cosy Pringle boasted that he always "came out top of the heap"; but some
people thought he was too "smart."</p>

<p>When the exhibition day came, although Simpsy Judkins had been announced
to "speak a piece," it was Cosy Pringle who spoke it; there was a report
that he had hired Simpsy to have a sore throat. Simpsy had oratorical
gifts, but he did not feel the advantages of appearing in public and
having his name in the paper, as Cosy did. Cosy held the second rank in
declamation, so Simpsy's sore throat gave him an opportunity to be
heard. He wasn't second in his class; he came sympathizingly near to
Amasa there; but he had carefully weighed opinions&mdash;which he sometimes
confided to Amasa&mdash;concerning the amount of study that "paid."</p>

<p>Mother Nature provided one of her loveliest days, as she is apt to do
for school exhibitions in June. The girls, in fleecy muslin clouds, were
so much in evidence that the boys, in the background, were only a little
hampered by the embarrassment of full dress. Cosy Pringle wasn't
hampered at all; he wore his grandfather's large gold chain and his
sister Amanda's moonstone ring, and felt that he ought to attract as
much attention as the girls.</p>

<p>Cosy's voice was a little thin and sharp, but he recited one of
Macaulay's lays with a great deal of "r-r-rolling drum" very well
indeed, having been thoroughly coached by his sister Amanda and the
young minister to whom Amanda was going to be married.</p>

<p>But beyond a little mild clapping, the recitation received no attention
whatever, while Viola Treddick's composition was, as the Bilberry
<i>Beacon</i> reported, received with the greatest enthusiasm. It was on
"School-girl Friendships," and there was some real fun in it; and once
in a while it was pathetic, or, at all events, the audience laughed and
cried, and they couldn't really do that, as Cosy averred they did,
because they liked Viola. It closed with a verse of original poetry, and
Bilberry began to feel sure that a great poet was to arise in its midst.</p>

<p>Lizette stopped and hugged Amasa behind a juniper-tree on the way home
from the exhibition. Viola had staid to a spread that was given to the
pupils and their friends; Lizette had to hurry back to her work in the
factory; and Amasa had felt that he did not shine in society. Amasa
could not remember ever to have seen Lizette cry for joy before; she was
not one of the crying kind, anyway.</p>

<p>"She'll have a chance! Viola will have a chance! She'll get the Pine
Bank School," she said, rapturously. "I've been so afraid she would have
to go into the factory."</p>

<p>Amasa realized suddenly how hard life was for Lizette. Her delicate
hands were calloused and knobby, and her shoulders bent; she looked
wistfully at the library books, and never had time to read; she knew
that she wasn't strong, and she was anxious about their future&mdash;Viola's
and his.</p>

<p>It was the very next night, as Amasa was going to bed, that Cosy Pringle
came under his window and called to him. Amasa went down and unfastened
the door, and Cosy followed him up stairs.</p>

<p>He seemed excited and nervous, and kept saying "'Sh!" though there was
no one stirring in the house. But it was like Cosy to have some
mysterious scheme on foot. Amasa thought that he had at last discovered
how Pember Tibbetts made his musk-rat traps, or guessed the conundrum in
the <i>County Clarion</i>, for which intellectual feat a prize of five
dollars was offered. Or perhaps he had secured the job of weeding Mr.
Luke Mellon's onion bed and hoeing his string-beans; last year he was
paid three dollars for the job, and hired Amasa to do the work for
seventy-five cents. Amasa stoutly resolved not to be the victim of
Cosy's sharp business methods this year.</p>

<p>But Cosy's shrewd gray eyes had a twinkle that meant more than
onion-weeding or any "jobs."</p>

<p>"That was an awful nice composition that your sister wrote," he said, in
an easy, complimentary manner.</p>

<p>Amasa nodded, brightening; it was more like Cosy to make a fellow feel
small about his sisters and all his possessions.</p>

<p>"Folks are saying that she'll get the Pine Bank School, if Elkanah Rice,
that's school committee, <i>does</i> want it for his niece. A good thing,
too, for Lizette is pretty well worn out taking care of you all." Cosy
wagged his head with great solemnity. "Aunt Lucretia said she shouldn't
be surprised if she got consumptive, like her mother, if she worked too
hard."</p>

<p>Amasa's heart seemed to stop beating, and a choking lump came into his
throat.</p>

<p>"But Viola'll get the school fast enough," continued Cosy, "if&mdash;if folks
don't find out that she copied the composition."</p>

<p>"Copied the composition!" Amasa's brows came together in a fierce scowl,
and he arose from the side of the bed where he was sitting, and advanced
upon Cosy with a threatening gesture.</p>

<p>"Now just look here before you go to making a turkey-cock of yourself,"
said Cosy, drawing a newspaper from his pocket. "I happened to go down
to Gilead this afternoon to swap roosters with Uncle Hiram&mdash;made him
throw in a pullet and a watering-pot because my rooster had a bigger
top-knot than his. There was a pile of newspapers in the wood-shed, and
I went to get one to wrap up some things that Aunt M'lissy was sendin'
to mother, and I came across this. 'School-girl Friendships' caught my
eye. See! it's signed 'Lilla Carryl.' Aunt M'lissy said she believed
'twas a girl over to Gilead Ridge. That paper is two years old now, and
Gilead being ten miles away, I suppose Viola thought nobody would ever
find her out!"</p>

<p>"She never did such a thing! Don't you dare say she did!" cried Amasa,
hoarsely.</p>

<p>But there it was in black and white; there it was word for word. Amasa
knew every word of Viola's composition, he had been so proud of it. Cosy
whistled softly, with his hands in his pockets, as Amasa ran his eye
over "School-girl Friendships."</p>

<p>"There's some mistake," faltered Amasa. "Viola is the honestest girl."</p>

<p>Cosy's whistling ended in a sharp, expressive, little crescendo squeak.
"There's no telling what girls will do," he said, sagely. "When folks
know it, why, Elkanah Rice's niece will be pretty apt to get the Pine
Bank School, and I'm kind of 'fraid Viola'll have to take a back seat
altogether. It'll come hard on Lizette."</p>

<p>Cosy folded the Gilead <i>Gleaner</i>, and thrust it firmly and impressively
into his pocket. Amasa had been acquainted with Cosy Pringle since they
were both in long clothes, and he understood that that paper had its
price. If he could pay the price, why, even Lizette need never know!</p>

<p>"I suppose it's my duty to show this paper," said Cosy, with an air of
unflinching virtue, "but still, amongst old friends, and if you'll do a
little good turn for me that you can do as well as not, why, I'll just
chuck the paper into the fire, and agree not to tell anybody, and we'll
call it square. I ain't a mean feller."</p>

<p>Amasa's heart thrilled with hope. What was the good turn that he would
not do for Cosy on those terms? He thought of his fan-tailed pigeons,
and of his dog Trip on whom Cosy had always had his eye because he could
do so many tricks; it would be an awful wrench to part with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1029" id="Page_1029">[Pg 1029]</a></span> Trip, but
to save Viola from disgrace he would not hesitate.</p>

<p>"I only want to go into your wood-shed chamber for a few minutes.
There's&mdash;there's something there that I want to see. If you'll let me,
why, nobody shall ever know about Viola's cheating."</p>

<p>"It's father's old workshop; there's nothing there," Amasa said. "Nobody
ever goes near it but Lizette."</p>

<p>Cosy hesitated a little, then he decided that it would be as well to be
more frank; Amasa was so stupid. "She's up to something, Lizette is," he
said, in an impressive whisper. "I've seen a light burning in that
workshop half the night! She's trying to make an improvement on the
knitting-machine that they use in the factory. Of course she can't do
it&mdash;a girl!&mdash;but you'd better look out or it will kill her, just as it
killed your father. How do I know what she's doing? She told Emily
Norcross"&mdash;Emily Norcross was the daughter of the owner of the
factory&mdash;"and Emily told Thad. Thad and I been trying too. We've got
things fixed now so'st we expect to get a patent. What I want to see is
whether she's got anything that's likely to interfere with us; of course
she hasn't really, but then girls think they can."</p>

<p>Amasa felt desperately that this was too great a problem to suddenly
confront a fellow like him whom every one knew to be stupid. It seemed a
trifle, but Cosy Pringle would want nothing but a good bargain. Still,
there was no other way; disgrace to Viola would mean heart-break to
Lizette.</p>

<p>"Give me the paper," he said, gruffly, and thrusting it into his pocket,
he led the way softly through the corridor to the wood-shed chamber.</p>

<p>Cosy was breathlessly eager over some queer bits of machinery which
Amasa could not understand. He staid but a few minutes, as he had
promised, but he stammered with excitement when he went away.</p>

<p>Amasa spent three miserable days, filling the wood-box so assiduously
that Viola asked him if he thought she was going to bake for the County
Conference, and hoeing the string-beans, until Lizette was tenderly sure
that his back ached, and advised him to go fishing.</p>

<p>But a boy may have troubles of the mind which even fishing cannot cure.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;VIOLA! AMASA! HE SAYS IT MAY BE WORTH A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY!&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Lizette came home from her work with a radiant face on the third day.
"Amasa, how came you to let Cosy Pringle go into the workshop?" she
exclaimed. "But I can't scold you, it has turned out so beautifully! I
have been trying a little invention&mdash;oh, for a long time! I never
thought it could really succeed!" Lizette looked as fresh and bright as
if all the work and care had been a dream. "Cosy saw it and told Thad
Norcross. It seems he and Thad had been trying to do the same sort of
thing&mdash;mere boys' play, of course&mdash;and Thad told his father. Mr.
Norcross will help me to get a patent! Viola! Amasa! He says it may be
worth a great deal of money!"</p>

<p>Lizette and Viola were crying for joy; but Amasa could think only of the
horror of Viola's disgrace, for now, of course, Cosy Pringle would tell.</p>

<p>"You won't think anything now of my little triumph," said Viola, when
they had calmed down a little and sat down to supper. "'School-girl
Friendships' is to be published in full in the Bilberry <i>Beacon</i> next
Saturday, with my own name signed it&mdash;not Lilla Carryl, as I signed it
two years ago, when I sent it to the Gilead <i>Gleaner</i>. Oh, what a
flutter I was in then! and I never dared to let a soul know it! The
editor of the <i>Beacon</i> made me write a foot-note, telling all about it."</p>

<p>"I'm an awful jackass," said Amasa, his voice gruff with joy and shame.</p>

<p>"You're the dearest boy in the world," said Lizette. "But I don't want
you to associate with Cosy Pringle."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1030" id="Page_1030">[Pg 1030]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<h3>OVERBOARD GO THE RANGERS.</h3>

<p>"Great Scott! Cal's overboard!" cried Will Rogers, as he caught a
twinkling glimpse of a pair of rubber-boots disappearing over the
sloop's bow. With the young Captain of the Rangers to think was also to
act. Thus, even as he spoke he tore off his jacket, sprang to the
vessel's side, and dove into the shining waters. He knew that Cal could
swim a little, under ordinary circumstances, but he dreaded the dragging
weight of those rubber boots, and also feared that the boy might be
struck and injured by the vessel as she passed over him.</p>

<p>Apparently every other Ranger on board thought the same thoughts, and
was actuated by the belief that it was his duty to rescue Cal Moody;
for, even as Will Rogers sprang overboard, all of them but one followed
him like a flock of sheep, and in another moment the river behind the
now swiftly moving sloop was dotted with the heads of swimming boys. The
one Ranger who had not leaped into the water was Abe Cruger, who,
realizing the impossibility of swimming in his "Bill Bullseye" garments,
contented himself with tumbling into the boat that towed astern and
casting her loose. As this boat contained but a single long oar, being
only fitted for sculling, and as Abe had never acquired that style of
navigation, he found himself about as helpless in his new position as he
would have been in the water, and could only shout impracticable advice
to the swimmers about him.</p>

<p>All these things happened with such bewildering rapidity as to
completely paralyze poor Captain Crotty, and the sloop shot ahead
several hundred feet before he recovered his senses sufficiently to
again throw her head into the wind, and thus check her progress. Young
Jabe was below starting a fire in the galley stove, and knew nothing of
what was taking place until summoned on deck by his father's shouts.</p>

<p>"Trim in the jib! Trim in quick! Now bear a hand with this mainsail!
Haul her flat! There, steady!" ordered Captain Crotty, and as, close
hauled on the wind, the sloop began slowly to work her way back toward
the drifting boat, young Jabe for the first time realized that, save for
his father and himself, there was not a soul aboard the vessel.</p>

<p>"What's happened?" he almost gasped.</p>

<p>"Don't ask me," replied the other, "for I don't know. All I do know is
that them boys is stark raving lunatics every last one of 'em, and if I
get 'em back here again I'll head 'em for their homes quick as ever the
good Lord'll let me. I never knowed what a fool I could be till I
undertook the managing of a passel of crazy boys off on a lark. Now I
don't expect nothing else but that the half of 'em'll be drowned, and
I'll be held responsible. Sarve me right too!"</p>

<p>By this time all the swimmers had collected about the boat containing
Abe Cruger, and, holding on to its gunwales, were pushing it slowly in
the direction of the sloop. Its sole occupant stood on a thwart, gazing
anxiously over the rippling waters.</p>

<p>"Don't you see anything? Not a sign?" inquired one and another,
anxiously.</p>

<p>"No, fellows; I can't make out so much as a bubble," was the hopeless
reply.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's awful!" groaned Will Rogers. "Poor little Cal! And his mother!
How can we tell her?"</p>

<p>As the boat drifted near the now anchored sloop Abe Cruger mechanically
caught the line flung to him by young Jabe, and she was drawn alongside.
One by one the swimmers were hauled up from the water by Captain
Crotty's strong hands, and when at length they all stood on deck he
inquired in a trembling voice, "How many's missing? Where's the little
one?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Will Rogers, with something very like a sob
choking his speech. "He is the only one missing; but I'm awfully afraid
we'll never see him alive again."</p>

<p>"Waal," said Captain Crotty, hoarsely, "I might have knowed something of
the kind would happen, and I'm only thankful there's as many of you left
as there is. Of course this ends the cruise, and I shall head back for
Berks just as quick as I get a fair wind up the river. Till then we'll
lie here and do what we can towards recovering the body. Now, you lads,
go below, get out of your wet clothes, give 'em to Jabe to dry, tumble
into your bunks and stay there. <i>Stay there</i>, d'ye hear, till I give you
permission to leave 'em. Yes, you too," he added to Abe Cruger, who was
beginning to explain that he had not been in the water. "I don't want to
resk having one of ye on deck. Your supper'll be brought to you when
it's ready, so there won't be no occasion to stir out of your bunks
before morning."</p>

<p>The skipper so evidently meant what he said that the boys saw it would
be useless to argue with him. Moreover they were too shocked by what had
happened, and too heavy-hearted for the attempt. So they silently and
sadly went below, and Captain Crotty followed them to see that his
orders were obeyed to the letter. Not until every Ranger had deposited a
little heap of wet clothing on the floor, and crawled in between the
blankets of his bunk, did the skipper leave them. Then he returned to
the deck for a soothing pipe-smoke and a quiet consideration of the
situation. He had hardly got his old black brier-wood well alight before
it dropped unheeded from his mouth, while the man stood pale and
nervous, as though he had seen a ghost. Of course he had not; but he
thought he heard one, which was almost the same thing. From somewhere,
though he could not at first locate it, a voice was calling, and it
sounded like that of the boy whom all on board were mourning as dead.</p>

<p>"Help! help! Will! Hal! help!" This cry had been repeated over and over
again for some minutes; but, owing to the confusion on board, and the
noise made by the boys, it had not been heard until now.</p>

<p>The skipper glanced along the deck, cast an eye aloft, and then over
both sides of the vessel into the darkening waters. No one was to be
seen, and the strong man began to tremble with superstitious fear. He
made his way forward and peered over the bows, but saw nothing nor heard
any thing, save the ripple of the current against the anchor chain.
Walking aft he again heard the voice, and, as he leaned over the stern,
it seemed to come from directly beneath him. It sounded so close that he
instinctively started back.</p>

<p>The small boat had all this time been kept alongside where young Jabe
had fastened it. Now hastening to it, filled with hope and dread, and at
the same time almost beside himself with excitement, the skipper dropped
astern, where he could look under the overhanging counter. There, from
out the dark shadow where swung the ponderous rudder, a white face
peered at him, and a weak voice uttered an exclamation of thankfulness.</p>

<p>Two minutes later Captain Crotty descended the companion-ladder and
entered the sloop's hold. In his arms he bore the dripping, shivering,
bareheaded, and barefooted form of little Cal Moody, the well-loved
comrade whose tragic fate the Rangers were discussing in subdued tones.</p>

<p>The lad's face and hands were covered with scratches from which blood
was oozing; but he could still smile, and still had voice enough to say,
"I'm awfully sorry, Will, but the mermaid startled me so that&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just here the Rangers, who had been paralyzed into momentary silence,
regained their senses, and realizing that he whom they had mourned as
dead was restored to them alive and well, broke into such a storm of
cheers, shouts, laughter, and questions, that young Jabe, with terrified
face, came rushing in from the galley filled with the belief that they
had gone sure enough crazy.</p>

<p>Regardless of appearances they leaped from their bunks and crowded
forward, eager to shake Cal by the hand, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1031" id="Page_1031">[Pg 1031]</a></span> even to feel of him, and so
assure themselves that he was real.</p>

<p>"Where did you find him?"</p>

<p>"Where has he been all this time?"</p>

<p>"How did he get so scratched up?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Cal, it's so good to see you!"</p>

<p>"Now we won't have to go home after all, will we?"</p>

<p>These were some of the questions and exclamations poured forth by the
excited boys. But before Cal could reply to one of them, Captain Crotty,
striving to conceal his joy beneath a stern exterior, roared out, "Let
him alone, ye lubbers, and get back to your bunks afore I murder half a
dozen of ye!" Then as the boys meekly obeyed this savage order, he began
with clumsy but gentle fingers to strip little Cal of his wet clothing.
Not until the lad was rubbed into a glow, and snugly tucked away between
warm blankets, was he allowed to explain what had happened to him. Then
he said:</p>

<p>"I was looking for mermaids, because the Captain told us to, you know,
and, besides, I wanted awfully to see a real truly one. When it came,
though, it jumped out of the water so kinder sudden that I tumbled right
overboard almost into its arms, and didn't get a good look at it,
either. I must have gone down a thousand feet before I got off my rubber
boots and began to come up. First I struck something hard and
scratchy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Barnacles on the vessel's bottom," explained the skipper.</p>

<p>"Yes, and we never cleaned them off, as you told us to," said Cracker
Bob Jones, remorsefully.</p>

<p>"Then," continued Cal, "I caught hold of something, and my head came out
of water, and as soon as I could I began to holler. I guess I hollered
more'n an hour before Captain Crotty came, and I was afraid nobody ever
would come; but now it's all right, only I don't want to have anything
more to do with mermaids&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>"I found the poor little chap sitting straddle of the rudder," commented
the skipper, "and pretty nigh ready to drop off from exhaustion; but,
thank God, I was in time."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Will Rogers. "Isn't it splendid to have him safe back again,
and aren't we just the happiest fellows in the world at this minute? But
I say, Captain, we won't have to go back to Berks, after all&mdash;that is,
not until our cruise is finished&mdash;will we?"</p>

<p>"Humph!" answered the skipper, as he turned to go on deck; "I don't know
about that."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<h3>MUTINY AND SHIPWRECK.</h3>

<p>The Rangers ate supper in their bunks, which they thought great fun, and
then in their overflowing joy they skylarked and threw pillows at one
another, until an unlucky shot brought the lantern down with a crash. As
this disaster not only came near to setting the sloop on fire, but left
them in total darkness, it also had the effect of so quieting them that
several actually dropped asleep, while the others discussed their
prospects in low tones, and wondered if they really would have to go
back without finishing the cruise as planned.</p>

<p>By this time young Jabe, with a sailor's happy facility for taking a nap
at any time, was sound asleep on deck forward, while the skipper sat aft
in a big chair, leaning against the tiller, thoughtfully puffing at his
pipe, and so affected by the soothing influences of the night that he
was wondering if, after all, he should have the heart to disappoint the
boys of their cruise.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill_004.jpg" width="500" height="347" alt="THE GHOSTS OF THE &quot;MILLGIRL.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">THE GHOSTS OF THE &quot;MILLGIRL.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Although a capital sailor and, under most conditions, a very sensible
man, the skipper of the <i>Millgirl</i> was inclined to be superstitious. So
when, a little later, by the swinging gleam of the sloop's riding light,
he saw a dim white figure gliding noiselessly along the deck towards
him, he gazed at it in speechless apprehension. To his dismay it was
followed by another, and still others, until the deck seemed crowded
with the phantom forms. All the stories of ghostly crews that he had
ever heard flashed into the skipper's mind, and, as the formless figures
silently approached him, his face was bathed in a cold perspiration. He
sat motionless until they were about to surround him, when, with a
mighty effort and a hoarse shout, he sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>At this the startled ghosts, who were only so many boys enveloped in
white blankets, fell backward so precipitately that they tumbled over
each other, and rolled on deck with stifled exclamations that at once
proclaimed their humanity and identity.</p>

<p>"Oh, you villains!" roared the relieved skipper. "You young pirates!
You, you&mdash;what do you mean by playing tricks like this on your
grandfather, eh? Tell me that afore I murder ye."</p>

<p>"Please, sir, we didn't mean to play any trick," answered one of the
blanketed figures meekly. "Only we thought, perhaps, you were asleep,
and wouldn't like to be disturbed. You see, we were afraid you might
sail back up the river to-night, and thought we'd better explain what
we'd decided to do before it was too late; for, you see, we've talked it
all over, and made up our minds not to go back until our cruise is
finished."</p>

<p>"Oh, ye have, have you?" remarked the skipper, in an interested tone, at
the same time throwing a protecting arm about Cal Moody, and drawing the
little chap close to him for fear lest he should get cold.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered the voice, which was now recognizable as that of
Will Rogers; "but we don't want you to be blamed for anything that may
happen, or to have any responsibility unless you want to."</p>

<p>"I don't exactly see how that is to be avoided so long as I'm in charge
of the vessel," interposed the skipper.</p>

<p>"Oh, we've settled all that," replied Will, cheerfully. "We'll simply
seize the sloop and sail her ourselves, and so take all the risk as well
as all the responsibility."</p>

<p>"You'll simply seize the vessel," repeated the skipper, slowly, and in a
bewildered tone, as though failing to comprehend what he had just heard.
"In that case, what's to become of me?"</p>

<p>"Why, we'll put you in irons, or lock you into your state-room, or let
you walk a plank, that is, if you know how walking a plank is done, or
set you ashore on a desolate island, or perhaps let you go adrift in the
small boat without oars or sail. Of course we'd give you plenty of
provisions and water, and you'd probably be picked up, 'cause you know
they always are. Anyhow, we'd let you take your choice of all those
ways."</p>

<p>"Waal, I'll be blowed!" exclaimed the skipper. "If these young pirates
hain't planned out a regular high-sea mutiny, with all the fixin's and
trimmings, then I'm a farmer."</p>

<p>"Of course," Will hastened to add, "we would rather have you choose to
be put in irons, and so stay on board, because when we get to sea if we
should strike a typhoon or anything we might want you to help navigate
the ship."</p>

<p>"That's so," reflected the skipper, gravely. "And on the whole, I think
I'd better stay aboard anyway. But now I'll tell you what I'll do. If
you mutineers will turn in, and promise not to leave your bunks again
before sunrise, I'll promise not to make any move toward going back
before that time, and not even then till we've talked the whole matter
over again by daylight."</p>

<p>This proposition seemed to the Rangers so satisfactory, and they were
becoming so shivery in the chill night air, as well as sleepy, that it
was promptly accepted; and, without further parley, the young mutineers
left the deck and hastened below. Little Cal Moody, cuddling close to
the big skipper, was already nodding, so the latter lifted him in his
strong arms, and carrying him into the hold again, tucked him snugly
into his bunk. Then, after bidding the mutineers a polite good-night,
and promising to carefully consider their proposition, the skipper
returned to the deck. Here for an hour or more he nearly choked with
suppressed laughter, which refused to be stilled, and ever broke out
afresh as he contemplated the novel aspects of the proposed mutiny.</p>

<p>"Bless their honest hearts," he finally said, half aloud, "I couldn't no
more disappoint them boys by carrying of 'em back than a fish could swim
on a railroad track. So I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1032" id="Page_1032">[Pg 1032]</a></span> suppose I might as well make a virtue of
necessity, and surrender at once."</p>

<p>Thus resolved, Captain Crotty turned in for a few hours' sleep; but he
was on deck again by daylight, when, with young Jabe's assistance, he
quietly got up the anchor, set the jib, and was merrily dropping down
stream long before a single Ranger even thought of opening his eyes.</p>

<p>When the sleepers were at length awakened by young Jabe's lusty shout of
"Breakfast!" they tumbled out of their bunks in a hurry, but sought in
vain for their clothing. It was not in cabin, hold, or galley; but the
mystery of its disappearance was speedily explained by Captain Crotty,
who, thrusting his head down the hatch, informed them that the cook,
learning of their mutiny, had inaugurated one of his own. "He says,"
continued the skipper, "that he's going to keep up his mutiny, which is
for the purpose of hiding your clothes, just as long as you keep up
yourn, but that as soon as you'll give in he'll give in. Now I'm going
to set down to breakfast, and only wish you were properly dressed to set
down with me, for it's an uncommon good one. I can tell you&mdash;corn
muffins and flapjacks with maple syrup an&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here the speaker was interrupted by a howl from the Rangers, who had
just realized how very hungry they were, and how impossible it would be
to carry on a mutiny unless properly clad for such an undertaking. Most
of them were willing to give in at once, but several held out, until,
overcome by a fragrant whiff of coffee that came floating in from the
cabin, human nature could resist no longer; so an unconditional
surrender was declared, and their clothing, all nicely dried, was
restored to them by the grinning Jabe. Five minutes later the recent
mutineers were gathered about the smoking breakfast table. As they
satisfied their ravenous appetites they also found occasion to rejoice
that their mutiny had effected its purpose, for they learned that the
skipper had surrendered even before they did, and that the sloop was
already headed toward their desired destination.</p>

<p>All that day they sailed down the beautiful river, and at night the
sloop was anchored at its mouth, where they were cooled by a sea-breeze
and rocked by a gentle swell rolling in from the Sound. The next day
they crossed the Sound, and finally drew near the lonely island on which
they anticipated such glorious times.</p>

<p>During these two days of sailing the skipper kept the boys from mischief
by interesting them in various simple problems of seamanship. He gave
them lessons in boxing the compass, splicing, tying knots, naming the
various sails, spars, and ropes, and in steering, that caused them to
realize with amazement the extent of their former ignorance concerning
such matters. Will Rogers was especially interested in all this, and
became so expert in steering that the skipper allowed him to hold the
tiller for an hour at a time.</p>

<p>"I tell you what, fellows," he said to a group of his comrades, after
being relieved from his trick at the helm, "we've learned such a lot on
this trip that I feel ashamed to think how little we really knew when we
started."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Cracker Bob Jones, "but we know more now than we even
thought we did when we left Berks."</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon the sloop reached the island, on which the
excited boys had already distinguished the tops of tents and a number of
gayly fluttering flags. There was a good harbor around a point, but the
channel to it was very narrow, and so beset with reefs that the skipper
was proceeding with unusual caution. Suddenly, as they were close to the
point, a fleet of canoes, under full sail and evidently racing, swept
out from behind it. So excited were their occupants that they took no
notice of the on-coming sloop, and a collision was imminent. To avert it
the skipper jammed his helm hard down. The sloop luffed sharply into the
wind, and in another moment brought up with a crash that threw every
Ranger to the deck. She heeled so far over that they thought she was
surely going to capsize, then slowly slid off into deep water and
righted. As she did so young Jabe rushed up from below and reported that
a torrent of water was pouring into the hold.</p>

<h3>BY ELLEN DOUGLAS DELAND.</h3>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

<p>With dripping clothes and a sad heart Cynthia went up to the house after
Neal had left her. She was bitterly disappointed and extremely
uncomfortable. Her hair, never very securely fastened, had fallen down
and lay in a wet mass about her face and neck; her hat felt heavy as
lead, and water oozed from her shoes as she walked.</p>

<p>"Nothing will ever be right again," she thought, as she gave a depressed
glance at all the familiar objects on the place. "I feel as if it were
going to rain forever, and the sun would never shine again. It would
have been so different if Neal had only come home!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Franklin was thankful to see her appear, and refrained from
reproaching her until she had been thoroughly dried and warmed. Then all
she said was:</p>

<p>"I thought you would never come, Cynthia! Was it worth while to go on
the river such a morning as this?"</p>

<p>"No, mamma; but you will forgive me when you hear why I went," said
Cynthia, setting down the cup of ginger tea which Mary Ann had made so
hot and so strong that she could scarcely swallow it. "But tell me how
Edith is, first."</p>

<p>"She is about the same. She seems anxious about something. She is
restless and uneasy, but it is difficult for her to speak. Perhaps she
wants you. I think that is it, for you know I do not satisfy her," added
Mrs. Franklin, with a sigh.</p>

<p>Cynthia knelt beside her, and put her arms around her. "Dear mamma!" she
said, lovingly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Franklin rested her head on her step-daughter's shoulder. "Cynthia
darling, you are a great comfort to me! Are you sure you feel perfectly
warm? You must not take cold."</p>

<p>"I'm as warm as toast. It won't hurt me a bit; you know I never take
cold. But let me tell you something&mdash;the reason I went. You could never
guess! I went to see some one."</p>

<p>Mrs. Franklin raised her head and looked at Cynthia.</p>

<p>"You can't mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. Neal!"</p>

<p>"Child, where is he? Is he here? Has he come back?"</p>

<p>"No, mamma," said Cynthia, shaking her head sadly, "he wouldn't come. I
begged and implored him to, but he wouldn't."</p>

<p>"Oh, Cynthia, why didn't you tell me? I could have made him come; I
would have gone down on my knees to him! Why didn't you tell me?"</p>

<p>"Because he said I mustn't. He sent me a note yesterday. I knew he would
never forgive me if I told."</p>

<p>"Yesterday! You knew he was coming yesterday? Cynthia, you ought to have
told!"</p>

<p>"But, mamma, he told me not to, and I didn't have time to think it over,
for we were so frightened with Edith's accident. It all came at once.
But you could not have made him come."</p>

<p>"Where is he now?"</p>

<p>"He has gone to Pelham to take the train, and he is going to write to
me, mamma. He says he&mdash;he is going to work."</p>

<p>"My poor boy!" said Mrs. Franklin, going to the window. "Tramping about
the country such a day as this without a home! I wonder if he has any
money, Cynthia?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, mamma."</p>

<p>Neither of them remembered that Neal had wilfully deserted his home, and
that it was entirely his own fault if he had no money in his pockets.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1034" id="Page_1034">[Pg 1034]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cynthia," said Mrs. Franklin, turning abruptly and facing her daughter,
"I want you to understand that I don't think Neal took that money. I
cannot believe it. I am sure he got it in some other way. Why do you
look so odd, Cynthia?"</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>"I believe you know something about it. Tell me!"</p>

<p>Still no answer.</p>

<p>"Could you have helped him in any way? Where would you get it? Why, of
course! How stupid we have all been! You had Aunt Betsey's present; you
never spent it, you would not buy the watch. Cynthia, you cannot deny
it; I have guessed it!"</p>

<p>The next moment Mrs. Franklin was enveloped in a vigorous hug.</p>

<p>"You dear darling, I'm <i>so</i> thankful you have! He wouldn't let me tell,
but I said this morning I wouldn't deny it if you happened to guess."</p>

<p>"Oh, Cynthia, though I said I didn't believe the other, this has taken a
thousand-pound weight from my heart!"</p>

<p>They were interrupted by the entrance of the nurse, who came to say that
her patient was growing more uneasy, and she thought some one had better
come to her. At the same moment Mr. Franklin arrived, so Cynthia went
alone to her sister.</p>

<p>She found her perfectly conscious, with large, wide-open eyes, watching
for her. Edith's head was bound up, and the pretty hands, of which she
had always been somewhat vain, moved restlessly. Cynthia took one of
them in her warm, firm grasp, and leaned over the bed.</p>

<p>"Dearest, you wanted me," she said, in a low voice; "I am going to stay
with you now."</p>

<p>But Edith was not satisfied. She tried to say something, but in so faint
a voice that Cynthia could not hear.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill_005.jpg" width="500" height="351" alt="&quot;I CAN&#39;T HEAR YOU,&quot; SHE SAID. &quot;DON&#39;T TRY TO SPEAK.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;I CAN&#39;T HEAR YOU,&quot; SHE SAID. &quot;DON&#39;T TRY TO SPEAK.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"I can't hear you," she said, in distress. "Don't try to speak; it will
tire you."</p>

<p>But still Edith persisted. Cynthia put her ear close to her sister.</p>

<p>"Did you say 'mamma'?" she asked.</p>

<p>The great brown eyes said "Yes."</p>

<p>"Do you want her?"</p>

<p>No, that was not it. Cynthia thought a moment.</p>

<p>"Oh. I know!" she exclaimed. "You are sorry about the drive, Edith; is
that it? You want mamma to forgive you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Cynthia flew down stairs.</p>

<p>"Mamma, mamma!" she cried, scarcely heeding her father, whom she had not
seen before, "come quickly! I have found out what Edith wants. She wants
you to forgive her for going to drive, and you will, won't you?"</p>

<p>And in a few minutes, satisfied, Edith fell asleep with her hand in that
of her mother's.</p>

<p>Many people came to inquire for Edith, for the news of her accident
spread like wildfire. Cynthia was obliged to see them all, as Edith
would scarcely let her mother go out of her sight. Now that her pride
had given way, she showed how completely her step-mother had won her
heart, entirely against her own will.</p>

<p>Among others came Gertrude Morgan.</p>

<p>"And how is your dear friend Tony Bronson?" asked Cynthia. "He nearly
killed Edith; what did he do to himself?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he didn't get very much hurt&mdash;at least he didn't show it much. He
went home right away. He thought he had better."</p>

<p>"Well, I should think he might have had the grace to come and inquire
for Edith, after upsetting her in that style, and almost breaking her
neck."</p>

<p>"He seemed to think he ought to get home. He thought he might be a good
deal hurt, only it didn't come out just at first. He said there were
inward bruises."</p>

<p>"Inward bruises!" repeated Cynthia, scornfully. "I guess the inward
bruise was that he was ashamed of himself for letting the horse run
away. Now don't you really think so, Gertrude? Don't you think yourself
that it was outrageous of him not to find out more about Edith before he
went?"</p>

<p>Gertrude was forced to acknowledge that she did think so; and,
furthermore, she confessed that her brother Dennis was so enraged at
Bronson's conduct that he declared he should never be asked there again.</p>

<p>"I'm glad of it!" declared Cynthia, emphatically. "It's about time you
all found out what a cad that Bronson is. If you knew as much as I know
about him you would have come to that conclusion long ago."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course you are prejudiced by Neal Gordon! I wouldn't take his
word for anything. By-the-way, have you seen him lately?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very lately. He came out to Brenton the other day."</p>

<p>"Did he, really?" cried Gertrude, curiously. "I thought he was never
coming back. The last story was that your father had turned him
out-of-doors."</p>

<p>"How perfectly absurd! I should think <i>you</i> knew enough about us to
contradict that, Gertrude! Will you please tell every one there is no
truth in it, at all?"</p>

<p>"But where is he now? Is he here? Why has nobody seen him? Wasn't any of
it true?"</p>

<p>"Dear me, Gertrude, you are nothing but a big interrogation point!"
laughed Cynthia, who had no intention of replying to any of these
questions; and Gertrude, baffled and somewhat ashamed of herself, soon
took her departure without having learned anything beyond the fact that
Neal had lately been in town and, as she supposed, at his sister's.</p>

<p>Aunt Betsey came from Wayborough as soon as she heard of what happened.
It was her first visit there since the death of Silas Green, and
naturally she was much affected.</p>

<p>"Cynthy, my dear," she said, after talking about him for some time to
her nieces, "let me give you a word of warning: Never put off till
to-morrow what can be done to-day! It is a good proverb, and worth
remembrance. If I hadn't put off and put off, and been so unwilling to
give up my view, I might have made Silas's last years happier. Perhaps
he'd have been here yet if I'd been with him to take care of him. Oh,
one has to give up&mdash;one has to give up in this world!"</p>

<p>They were in Edith's room, and Edith, listening, felt that Aunt Betsey
was right. She, too, had learned&mdash;many, many years earlier in life than
did her aunt&mdash;that one must learn to give up.</p>

<p>Miss Betsey did not look the same. The gay dress that she once wore was
discarded, and she was soberly clad in black. She really was not unlike
other people now, but her speech was as quaint as ever.</p>

<p>She brought Willy's present with her, and was shocked to find that
Janet's had never been received.</p>

<p>"Well, now, I want to know!" she exclaimed, rocking violently. "I did it
up with my own hands. I remember it exactly, for it was a few days after
the funeral, and I was that flustered I could scarcely tie the cord or
hold the pen. It was a large rag doll I had made for the child, just
about life size, and a face as natural as a baby's. And I made a nice
little satchel to hang at the side, and in the satchel was the money.
Too bad she didn't get it! I remember I gave it to old Mr. Peters to
mail. He was going down Tottenham way, and he said he'd take it to the
post-office there. He'd stopped to see if there was anything he could do
for me just as I was tying it up, so I let him take it along. He's half
blind, and just as likely as not he went to the meeting-house instead of
the post-office. He wouldn't know them apart. You may depend upon it, it
warn't Government's fault you didn't get it. Of that I'm very sure."</p>

<p>And, true to her principles, the patriotic little lady rocked again. No
one told her of the suspicion which had rested upon Neal. It would have
distressed her too deeply, and nothing would be gained by it.</p>

<p>"And now, Jack, I must see those little orphans," she said to her
great-nephew, when he came home that afternoon. "Poor little things, are
they at all happy?"</p>

<p>Jack led her in triumph to the poultry-yard.</p>

<p>"Well, I want to know!" she exclaimed, throwing up her mitted hands when
she saw six or seven hundred very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1035" id="Page_1035">[Pg 1035]</a></span> contented-looking fowls of all sizes,
kinds, and ages, each brood in its allotted habitation, pecking,
running, crowing, and clucking, and enjoying life generally.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say, Jackie, that not one of these hens ever had any
mother but that heartless box in the cellar? Well, I want to know! They
do look real contented. Do tell!"</p>

<p>Her nephew proudly assured her that they appeared to be exceedingly
happy, and that he also was happy; for they paid well, and he would soon
be able to return the money that he had borrowed of her.</p>

<p>And indeed in a few weeks Jack travelled out to Wayborough, and with his
own hands gave back to his aunt the seventy-five dollars which she so
kindly had advanced to him, and which he had earned with his own hard
work.</p>

<p>The best part of it all was when his father spoke to him with
unqualified praise.</p>

<p>"I am really proud of my son, Jack," he said. "You have done well. I
have watched you carefully, and I saw the plucky way in which you met
your discouragements. It makes me feel that I have a son worth having.
Keep at it, my boy. If you put the same pluck and perseverance into
everything you undertake you will make a name some day."</p>

<p>And when Jack remembered how his father had frowned down the idea of the
incubator he felt more pleased than ever.</p>

<p>One day a letter came to Cynthia from Neal. It was the first they had
received. Mr. Carpenter had written to Mrs. Franklin, telling her that
Neal was with him, and that he had taken him into his office; and Hester
wrote to her brother at once, but he answered neither that letter nor
the many that followed. He was still obdurate. It was an exciting
moment, therefore, when Cynthia recognized the bold, boyish handwriting
on the envelope.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Cynth</span> [he wrote],&mdash;I promised to write to you, so here goes.
I am living with Cousin William Carpenter, and probably shall for
the rest of my days. He is in the lumber business, and lumber is
awfully poky. However, I'm earning my living. Did you ever see a
Quaker? They are a queer lot. It would not do for you to be one,
for they never get excited. If the house got on fire Cousin
William and Cousin Rachel would walk calmly about and 'thee' and
'thou' each other as quietly as ever. They don't say 'thou,'
though. Cousin William says it has become obsolete.</p>

<p>"I do nothing but measure boards and write down figures. Boards
are tiresome things. I go to Quaker meeting sometimes, though I
should say Friends' meeting. They call themselves Friends. All the
men sit on one side and all the women on the other, and the men
keep their hats on all through. Sometimes there isn't any sermon
and sometimes there are five or six, just as it happens. The women
preach too, if they feel like it. One day it was terribly still,
and I was just beginning to think I should blow up and bust if
somebody didn't say something&mdash;had serious thoughts of giving a
sermon myself&mdash;when I heard a familiar voice, and I looked over,
and there was Cousin Rachel preaching away for dear life. And a
mighty good sermon it was, too&mdash;better than any of the men's.</p>

<p>"Cousin William takes me to see the sights on Saturday (or,
rather, Seventh day, as he would say) afternoon, and I have been
about myself a good deal. I would like to get to know the people,
but have no chance. I wish you would write to a fellow, Cynth. I
would like to see you pretty awfully much. How you did give it to
me that day on the river! You were a brick, though, to come. I
have not forgotten what you said. I am going to show you I am no
coward, though you said I was. I'll stick at the lumber trade
until I die in the harness, and here's my hand and seal!</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 32em;">"Yours,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 32em;">"<span class="smcap">Neal Gordon</span>.</span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"P.S.&mdash;Give my love to Hessie. I hope Edith is coming round all
right."</p></div>

<p>It was better than nothing, though Mrs. Franklin wished that the letter
had been to her. Still, it was far, far better than if it had not been
written at all. And then he had sent his love to her. It was in a
postscript, and was probably an after-thought, but she was glad he did
it. He seemed well and moderately happy, and for that his sister was
very grateful. Fortunately Hester could not read between the lines, and
learn that the boy was eating his heart out with homesickness and a
longing to see his only sister.</p>

<p>Neal found this quiet life, so far from his family and friends, very
different from that to which he had been accustomed, and sometimes it
seemed very dreary and hard to bear. Then, again, he was quite unused to
steady occupation, and his cousin demanded unflagging attention to
business. It was good for the boy, just what he needed; but that made it
none the less irksome.</p>

<h2><a name="WATER_LIFE_AROUND_NEW_YORK" id="WATER_LIFE_AROUND_NEW_YORK"></a>WATER LIFE AROUND NEW YORK.</h2>

<h3>BY JULIAN RALPH.</h3>

<p>What an odd thing a boatman's dream of the water life around New York
would be if all the vessels and craft of every kind should take to
themselves grotesque shapes and characters, as familiar objects are apt
to do in human dreams! We have had some great and notable water parades
in our harbor&mdash;the last and greatest being that queer hooting and
tooting procession of many kinds of craft that swept around the
war-ships of ten or a dozen great nations at our Columbus celebration in
the early summer of 1893. But the boatman's dream of which I was
thinking would be far stranger than that, because the Columbian naval
review included only the handy, easily manageable steam-craft of New
York, like the steamships and steamboats and tugs and tow-boats. It left
out all the really queer floating things that have such shapes as to
almost turn a dream into a nightmare.</p>

<p>The dreaming boatman of whom I am thinking would see great
water-giraffes, which would really be our floating grain-elevators; and
a myriad sea-spiders transformed from our darting tug-boats, and great
groaning mother-gulls dragging large coveys of helpless babies in their
wake Those would be the tow-boats with their long trains of canal-boats.
Turtles he would see by the score&mdash;huge flat, almost round turtles&mdash;some
red, some white, some brown. Those would be the ferry-boats,-which
really do look just like great sea-turtles when you are looking down
upon their flat backs from a high place like the Brooklyn Bridge. Like
fearful black ocean sharks would be the Atlantic steamers&mdash;long and
thin&mdash;out of whose way every other moving thing flies when they
approach. Our huge and towering palace boats of the Sound would turn
into great white elephants, trumpeting as if they had all caught cold in
their long snouts. And we shall see that many another animal and
creature would easily appear to the troubled dreamer without greatly
altering the shapes of the queer craft that have grown out of nearly
three hundred years of needs and developments in the water-life around
New York.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill_006.jpg" width="500" height="317" alt="THE CANALLERS ON THE EAST RIVER." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE CANALLERS ON THE EAST RIVER.</span>
</div>

<p>I suppose that the reader has heard that almost every Chinaman in this
country comes from the water population near Canton. That must be a
wonderful phase of life, where so many hundreds of thousands of persons
are actually born upon the water, to live out their lives upon the
water, and to die upon the water. They form a river population housed in
boats that make up a city far more peculiar than Venice&mdash;a floating city
of stores and work-shops, boarding-houses, amusement places, saloons,
and all the rest. We have nothing of the sort around New York. The
nearest approach to that condition is to be seen in the large docks on
the East River near the Battery, and one at Communipaw on the New Jersey
shore, where the canal-boats collect with the boatmen and their wives
and children aboard them. There one sees by the kitchen smoke-stacks
above the cabin roofs, by the lines of drying linen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1036" id="Page_1036">[Pg 1036]</a></span> on the decks, by
the sight of women sewing and knitting under cooling awnings, and by the
views of children and cats and dogs playing upon the boats&mdash;by all these
things one sees how truly the canal-boats are floating homes as well as
merchant vessels. At night the sounds of singing and fiddling&mdash;sometimes
the nasal notes of house organs&mdash;tell more of this strange water life.
Some of the cabins of these canal-boats are quite attractive. They show
dainty white lace curtains in the tiny square windows, carpets on the
floors, boxes of flowers upon the cabin roofs, and cleanly, neatly clad
mothers and little children. This is not the rule, however, and we see
enough, whenever we visit the canallers, to show that there is at least
some reason for their being generally regarded as a rude and rough
class.</p>

<p>Yet, apart from these canallers, we have enough persons who live on
the water to form what would be called a city out West. They are
mainly men who sleep in bunks and eat in the cabins of tug-boats,
steam passenger boats, freighters, and the like. A few women are among
them&mdash;stewardesses of passenger boats and the wives of the captains of
the other sorts of vessels. Of course I do not include here the men on
the ships that sail the ocean. Their homes are really at sea. I only
refer to the scores of thousands of persons who live upon boats that may
be called the horses of the harbor, because they tie up regularly every
night at certain piers, and every morning are sent to work, here and
there, at this place or that, to carry goods or passengers, or to haul
other boats. It is doubtful whether many children are born in these
shifting homes, but there is no doubt that very many girls and boys
sleep upon them, and are sent from them to the city's schools, and,
later, to the factories and shops to earn their living.</p>

<p>Of all the uncommon forms that boats take, the newest, instead of being
strange and complicated like most nineteenth-century inventions, are
almost as simple as anything that floats. Only rafts of logs are more
simple than what we call our "car-floats." They are the newest type of
boats we know, and have come into being because New York city is on an
island, with only a few railroads crossing to it from the mainland. The
other great and little railways, which bring and take goods and people
to and from New York, all stop on the opposite shores of our harbor, in
New Jersey, Staten Island, and Long Island. Since the cars of one
railroad often have to go past the city upon the other roads, these
"floats" are used to transport them around our island, so that goods
from Boston or Sag Harbor, for instance, can be sent around New York to
the tracks of the roads that will carry them to San Francisco without
unloading or reloading. The floats that carry these cars are merely
boxes, the shape of great dominoes, with railroad tracks laid upon them.
Some carry six freight-cars, some carry eight, and some carry ten cars.
Tiny little propellers that we call "tug-boats" are warped or hitched
alongside of these clumsy floating boxes, where they look as a little
kitten would appear beside a big St. Bernard dog, or as a locomotive
would look beside a house. But our queer, snorting, fussy little
tug-boats march away with every floating thing to which they are
hitched&mdash;even dragging huge Atlantic steamships at their sides&mdash;because
they reach deep down into the water, where their big screws, driven by
very powerful engines, obtain a mighty hold. Because our tug-boats are
so small, and yet so strong, they are able to move swiftly when they
have no burdens to carry. In the boatman's dream that I spoke of they
would seem like those water-spiders that many of us have seen darting
hither and thither on the top of placid pools. But there is one reason
why they are not at all alike&mdash;that is, that the water-spiders are as
silent as death, while the tug-boats are the most noisy, saucy,
boisterous of make-believe animals&mdash;always gasping, and snorting, and
whistling, and thrashing about as very little people are often apt to
do.</p>

<span class="caption">FLOATING GRAIN ELEVATOR.</span>
</div>

<p>The "floats" that carry passengers around New York so that they can go
to Boston from Philadelphia or Chicago without changing cars (and even
without getting out of bed on the sleeping cars), are not floats at all.
They are very powerful and large steamboats, with decks covered with
iron plates, with car tracks on those decks, and with arrangements for
locking the car wheels fast to the tracks, so that no matter how
boisterous the water may be on stormy days, the cars cannot break loose
and roll overboard. We have several queer sorts of boats and other
floating objects that look like floating houses. Among them are what we
call our floating baths, and our floating docks, and our cattle and ice
barges. But there is one kind of floating building that looks like a
tower or a steeple riding the waters and steering itself around. That
strange thing&mdash;and we employ many such&mdash;is a floating grain-elevator. It
is a tall four-sided tower built upon a squat snub-nosed boat. It has a
great proboscis, that it sticks down into canal-boats full of grain,
which it sucks or dips out so that it can load the grain into the holds
of ships that are to carry it to Europe. Our floating baths are square
one-story houses, hollow in the middle, where the bathers swim, with
lattice-work or perforated boards under them to let in the water without
letting out the bathers. They are decorated with little towers and
flag-staffs, and look very strange indeed when they are being towed to
the city in the early summer to be moored beside a wharf, or when, after
the bathing season is over, they are dragged away to be laid up for the
winter. Our floating docks, upon which all but the very large ships and
steamboats are lifted out of the water to have their hulls painted,
cleaned, or repaired, are made of many boxes joined together. These
boxes sink when full of water, and thus it is possible to steer a vessel
right over them. Then the water is pumped out of the boxes, and the dock
(in reality a cradle rather than a dock) rises, and lifts the vessel up
high and dry so that workmen can walk all around and under her to scrape
off the barnacles that have grown fast to her, or to paint her bottom,
or to sheathe it with copper.</p>

<span class="caption">ICE-BARGES IN TOW.</span>
</div>

<p>The barges for carrying cattle and those for carrying ice are just like
the toys that are made for children and called "Noah's Arks." They are
houses built upon strong boat hulls. The ice-barges are always white,
and canvas windmill wheels are forever whirling above them, just as if
they were some new kind of boats made to go by air propellers instead of
wheels or screws in the water. The truth is, of course, that these
canvas wheels work the pumps that pump out the water made by the
constant melting of the ice. But of all the kinds of barges that work in
the New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1037" id="Page_1037">[Pg 1037]</a></span> York waters the hay-barges are surely the most interesting.
They are very large, and the houses built upon their hulls are open at
the sides, with only a railing where the walls should be. These are
two-storied houses, and the floors that support hay in the winter are
dancing platforms in the summer. These hay-barges are our picnic boats
also. All winter long, or as long as the waters are unfrozen, they bring
down hay from the Hudson River landings, but in the summer they go out
of that business, and are hired out to Sunday-schools, political clubs,
secret societies, church societies, and the like, to carry picnickers to
what are called the excursion parks that are found along the Hudson
River and the Sound at several hours' distance from the metropolis.
Tug-boats drag these barges to the excursion parks, and the holiday
crowds upon the two open decks of the barges dance all the time to the
music of the band that they hire for the occasion. The stop at the
excursion park is a short one&mdash;just long enough for luncheon and a
little strolling under the trees, or bathing on the beach. Then the
homeward journey is begun, and the dancing on the barge is recommenced
and kept up until the city is reached, just before bedtime. Our great
excursion steamboats, that run to Coney Island and Rockaway, are built
on the same plan&mdash;wide open&mdash;and carry such great crowds of
pleasure-seekers that they are black with passengers. These are
sometimes hired by richer and more numerous bodies than those that hire
the hay-barges, but I can assure my readers that the real jubilant fun
is on the common barges, where the people are apt to be simple and
democratic, and ready to surrender themselves to those pleasures of
which they enjoy too little.</p>

<p>Our pilot-boats which go out to sea with many brave men, and leave them
one by one on the steamships that they meet&mdash;in order that those great
vessels may be safely steered into port&mdash;are very romantic boats, but
they look like mere sail-boats or yachts. Some splendid yachts become
pilot-boats when they grow too old-fashioned to keep pace with the
faster and faster boats that we are forever building. Other such yachts
become oyster-boats, and lie beside Fulton Fish Market in company with
the tank-steamers that bring fish into New York. These tank-steamers go
to Nantucket, or wherever the fishing-smacks are at work, and lie there
while sail-boat after sail-boat fill up with fish and bring their loads
to be kept in the refrigerated-tanks of the steamer, until she, also, is
filled and ready to come to the city.</p>

<p>Of the "whalebacks," or cigar-shaped iron ships that were first made to
traverse the great lakes, I will say very little, because they belong to
no place in particular, and excite as much curiosity here as anywhere.
Our floating pile-drivers, which look like ladders set upon boxes, are
very curious-looking vessels, but are familiar at all ports. Perhaps our
immigrant barges, which carry the immigrants from Ellis Island (where
they are landed) to the wharves of the railways by which they are to
seek homes in the West, are peculiar to New York, but they are mere
hay-barges like the excursion boats I have already described. The busy
craft that carry fresh drinking-water to the sailing-ships are usually
very ordinary tug-boats, and are only peculiar because each one carries
a great sign bearing the word "WATER" painted upon it. To see such a
vessel all by itself upon a great expanse of salt water suggests
Coleridge's line in <i>The Ancient Mariner</i>,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">"Water, water, everywhere, and not a drop to drink."</span><br />
</p>

<p>If it were not for those water-bearers&mdash;serving the same purpose as the
camels laden with water-bags upon the desert of Sahara&mdash;there truly
would not be a drop to drink.</p>

<p>I fancy that what we call our "lighters" are the only descendants that
recall the old days of the Dutch on Manhattan Island. They are
sail-boats that are used to carry goods from or to vessels that do not
come to the wharves, but lie out in the open water. They are very
old-fashioned and foreign-looking, built almost solidly of heavy wood,
and of a shape very like a turtle and quite as clumsy. Each one carries
a short thick mast that looks as if it had been broken off, and a little
narrow sail, absurdly disproportioned to the vessel. Everything these
lighters carry is put upon their decks, and they are so slow and so hard
to steer and so strong that all other craft give them a wide berth. It
is only a fancy of mine, yet I never see one without thinking that this
style of boat surely descended to us from the Dutch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1038" id="Page_1038">[Pg 1038]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="A_FREE_ENTERTAINMENT_IN_THE_SAHARA" id="A_FREE_ENTERTAINMENT_IN_THE_SAHARA"></a>A FREE ENTERTAINMENT IN THE SAHARA.</h2>

<p>The learned Professor Ducardanoy, and his assistant, Bouchardy, had been
toiling along the desert's edge all day. They had hoped to reach the
Algerian settlement of Nouvelle Saar-Louis before night, but the sun was
getting near the blank western horizon of yellow sand, and the low
mountain upon which Nouvelle Saar-Louis was built, the last southern
foot-hill of the Atlas, was still some twenty miles away to the east.</p>

<p>"We shall have to camp here in the sand, and push on in the morning,"
said the learned Ducardanoy, who was, as all his contemporaries knew,
the most renowned living chiropodist.</p>

<p>"I fear we shall," said the assistant, Bouchardy, who was not, it must
be understood, an assistant in Ducardanoy's surgery, but merely an
unscientific fellow who managed the magic-lantern, ate wool, and
breathed fire, and did the other things which constituted the grand free
entertainment preceding Ducardanoy's evening lectures on the science of
chiropody, in the course of which he was accustomed to perform a few
gratuitous operations with Ducardanoy's Corn Cure to prove its efficacy.
"I fear we shall," said Bouchardy; "but what is that building a mile or
so to the south? Perhaps we had better go there."</p>

<p>"Ah! ha!" said Ducardanoy, looking through a field-glass; "it is an old
Roman tower. Undoubtedly it is, for there is nothing Moorish about it,
and the Romans and French are the only people who have erected anything
more substantial than tents in this part of Algeria."</p>

<p>"I think we had better go there," said Bouchardy, "and go rapidly, too.
Look behind you."</p>

<p>Away off to the west, galloping along in the track of the setting sun,
was a cavalcade of horsemen.</p>

<p>"Spahis," said Ducardanoy, calmly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," said Bouchardy. "Perhaps French cavalry, and perhaps Arab
robbers. Who knows? It is best to be prepared. If you choose you may
stay here to sleep in the sand to-night, and perhaps for all the nights
thereafter forever; but as for me, I am going to the Roman castle," and
he spurred on his horse and arrived at the tower some minutes after the
learned Ducardanoy, who was better mounted than he, and, moreover, was
not burdened with a magic-lantern and other appliances used in the free
entertainment. They found the tower to be nothing more than a plain
round edifice with a single upper chamber in it, reached by a flight of
narrow winding stairs ascending in a gentle incline. Up these stairs
they led their horses, as the Roman frontier guards had done centuries
before, and then looked out of the loop-holes for the approaching enemy.</p>

<p>"We can easily keep any of them from coming up the stairs," said
Bouchardy.</p>

<p>"And they can easily keep us from coming down," said Ducardanoy. "But
perhaps they have not seen us."</p>

<p>They were soon satisfied on that score, for the cavalcade of
horsemen&mdash;thirty-five wild desert Arabs&mdash;halted before the tower, and in
broken French commanded the chiropodist and his assistant to surrender.
This command was not obeyed. The Arabs laughed and picketed their
horses, and after a little a caravan of camels bearing tents and women
and children arrived, and the Arabs went into camp for the night.</p>

<p>"If they kill us, the French government will wipe them from the face of
the earth," said Ducardanoy, along toward the middle of the night.</p>

<p>"If the French government finds it out. But the death of those
scoundrels will not bring me to life," said Bouchardy. "I think it will
be well to make a sortie."</p>

<p>"They would hear us taking the horses down; and if we start on foot we
can't get so far away before daylight that they could not soon discover
us by making scouts into the desert. Besides, I imagine that the
entrance to the tower is guarded."</p>

<p>"When morning comes, I will eat wool and breathe fire and scare them
away," said Bouchardy.</p>

<p>"To do that you must show yourself," said Ducardanoy. "And they will
fill you full of lead while you are filling yourself with wool. But if
we can scare them, it will be the only way we can get rid of them."</p>

<p>"I have it," said Bouchardy.</p>

<p>A moment later the sentinel at the foot of the town gave an exclamation
of surprise, for there, opposite him, against the white walls of the
Sheik's tent, in the midst of a blaze of light, stood a French soldier
bowing to him. Promptly he sighted his ancient flint-lock, and sent a
bullet between the soldier's eyes.</p>

<p>"Mashallah," said the sentinel, for the soldier kept on bowing, and the
hole in his head moved from his nose to the roots of his hair and back
again as he did so.</p>

<p>"The devil himself," said the sentinel: and even before he finished
saying it, the soldier had vanished, and there stood the devil&mdash;a huge
black fellow grinning and bowing.</p>

<p>Bang! went the sentinel's gun again, and by this time the whole camp was
aroused and staring at the Sheik's tent, muttering and moaning the
while. The tent flap opened and the Sheik himself stepped out, and
immediately there appeared on the white robes across his broad chest a
great bloody splash, in the midst of which shone a hideous death's head.
A cry of terror arose, and the Arabs began scurrying about in the
darkness, saddling their horses and camels, the women and children
screaming, and in the midst of the confusion there appeared in a
loop-hole of the tower the face of a man illuminated by the glow of the
fire he was breathing. Picket-ropes and saddle-girths were dropped, and
those who were not already mounted rushed away on foot.</p>

<p>"We took in more money from that entertainment than we ever did in a
year from the sales of corn medicine after our ordinary entertainments,"
said Bouchardy. "They have left behind them forty camels, ten horses,
twelve Damascus swords, six silver pipes, eighteen bales of silk,
thirty-five gold bracelets, six dozen rings, eight gold inlaid bridles,
and we haven't looked in the Sheik's treasure-chest yet. Let us abandon
the profession of chiropody, and buy estates at Nouvelle Saar-Louis. It
is a pleasant place to live in, and will be convenient for us in case we
start out on other expeditions to be robbed by Arab tribes."</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="JOAN_OF_ARC" id="JOAN_OF_ARC"></a>JOAN OF ARC.</h2>

<p>Every one knows the story of Joan of Arc, and it never fails to be
interesting from whatever point you look at it or study it. But a good
many boys and girls think of the story, as they do of many another read
in school histories, as being nothing more than one of many lessons
learned and to be learned. There is a great deal in the history of
Joan's short life that is interesting as a practical story, to say
nothing of any other interest.</p>

<p>The little Joan of Arc was born in the southern central part of France,
in a little village called Domremy, partly in Lorraine and partly in
Champagne, 484 years ago, and though she led armies in some of the most
famous battles ever fought in France, and crowned a king, she never
reached the age of twenty, and never learned to read or write. Her
father and mother were peasants in Domremy and were poor, as peasants in
France always have been&mdash;so poor that little Joan had to begin early to
do her part of the work, which meant three meals a day to the family.</p>

<p>When she was old enough her father used to send her to watch over the
sheep all day long in the fields and woods near their home, and all
through these long hours, in the heat of summer or the cold of fall or
spring, she had nothing to do but think and watch sheep grazing. It was
a strange age in France four centuries and a half ago. People generally
believed in visions, in miracles, in supernatural powers, and were
easily influenced by fanaticism and enthusiasm in religious and
every-day matters. A huge crowd of men, women, and children would become
possessed with some idea, and would leave their daily work, their shops,
their house-keeping, and their games, and rush to market-place or field
to carry out this idea. In many towns the whole inhabitants would give
their labor to build an enormous cathedral. Hundreds of people would
catch hold of a long rope, and drag one of the big blocks of stone
through a city's streets to be placed on the cathedral walls, and
hundreds of unfortunate people and children were killed by different
kinds of accidents while working in this fanatical way.</p>

<p>Then it was common, too, for some one to say that he or she was inspired
by visions and voices to do or say one thing or another, and the people
would rush after the inspired one to hear or to do whatever was ordered,
or to try and be healed by touching the inspired person. Some were rank
fakirs, who every now and then grew rich before they were discovered.
Others really believed in all they said and did, and their confidence in
themselves made hundreds of people follow them.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to think this is all gone by nowadays, for as a matter
of fact it is not. Only a few years ago hundreds of people in all the
stages of consumption travelled to Berlin to be treated by Dr. Koch,
because he gave out, and no doubt, believed, that he had found a cure
for it. At Lourdes, a city in France, there is to-day a grotto where
people go for miles and miles around to be cured of all sorts of
incurable diseases. And if these things attract people to-day, when
nobody really believes much in such matters, you can begin to realize
what fearful enthusiasm there must have been in a day when every one was
only too glad to believe such things, and when most persons felt more or
less strongly that they were some day going to have visions or missions
of some kind.</p>

<p>It is not so surprising, then, that Joan, after spending several years
day after day alone in the fields, occasionally hearing about all the
troubles and wars in France, and having hours and hours when she could
do nothing but think, should have thought she was inspired with a
mission to save her country from the English invaders, and that, once
perfectly persuaded of this, she should have quickly had a lot of people
running after her and spreading her fame abroad.</p>

<p>Another thing was not so unusual as it seems to-day. Joan, when she
finally saw Charles VII. of France, and persuaded him that he was the
real King of France, and that all they had to do was to march to Rheims
and crown him&mdash;Joan wore a suit of man's armor. She was only eighteen
years old, and a delicate girl of middle height. It was unusual, of
course, for so young a girl to go to war, but in those days women led
bodies of men, and some of them wore armor. Women, who by birth and the
absence of male relatives had been left in charge of large feudal
estates, had to keep little armies to protect their lands and fields
from attack, and when such attacks did come they had to go out in many
cases and lead their men themselves.</p>

<p>So that while her visions, her calm confidence, and her male dress were
enough to attract attention, they did not seem so impossible to the
people of her time by a great deal as they would to the people of
to-day. And then, also, everybody was ready to follow any "inspired"
person who foretold anything which really happened, or who carried out
what he or she started to do. Joan, after going to the King and telling
him that if he followed her he would become the crowned King of France,
began to find everyone following her, believing in her just as calmly as
she believed in herself. The Englishmen had invaded the north of France
and held the city of Paris, and the great Duke of Burgundy was in league
with them. They wanted to crown Henry VI. of England, King of France
also, and they marched southward and captured Orleans, which practically
opened southern France to them.</p>

<p>Joan told King Charles VII. that she could recapture Orleans, and crown
him King at Rheims, and in a little while he gave her five or six
thousand men. Mounted on her white horse, in full armor, she led these
men on, and by her confidence and vigor and good common-sense, persuaded
the generals to attack Orleans in a certain way. Half a dozen times the
besiegers were practically defeated, and would have gone back, but Joan
staid before the city gates, and no one could make her turn back. Such
perfectly fearless conduct acted just as it has always acted, just as it
acted a thousand times in the civil war, in the Revolution, and
everywhere else. The men grew crazy with enthusiasm, and rushed again
and again after Joan at the defences of the city, with the result that
they finally captured it.</p>

<p>Then any one was ready to follow the young girl, except her enemies at
court; and when she ordered King, court, army, and all to go quickly
northward into the part of France within the English control, they
followed. The result was that Charles VII. was crowned King, and the
first man crowned meant a great deal then. It was all done by a
combination of shrewd common-sense, and the extraordinary willingness to
believe absolutely in inspired people and follow them with religious
enthusiasm, which always has been in history an irresistible force.</p>

<p>Afterward Paris was attacked, but as soon as Joan was wounded the attack
was dropped. Experienced generals could not make men fight the way this
girl could, though she knew nothing of military tactics, and had never
led anything but sheep before.</p>

<p>All this time the English were trying to capture Joan, and then prove
her to be a sorceress, in order to show that any person crowned through
her agency must of course be the wrong man. Hence Henry VI. could be
crowned and recognized as the real King of France. They did finally buy
her of one of the Duke of Burgundy's vassals; and then began a bogus
trial to prove she was a sorceress, since merely putting her to death
without proving some evil agency in her work would only make her a
martyr. Charles VII., once being King, did not know exactly what to do
with Joan, so he took no steps to rescue her from the English, and they
spent many weary days in trying to make her say something which could be
used to prove she was a sorceress. Failing in this, for she believed too
strongly in herself and in her visions to alter her statements, they
killed her by burning her alive in the streets of Rouen, in 1431, with
the result that she became a martyr at once, and her work for France
became the sacred belief of all French people. And in all the sad and
fascinating story, the most interesting and wonderful point is the
courage, the bravery, and the wonderful brain which a young girl of
nineteen or twenty had to sway men and capture cities and crown Kings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1040" id="Page_1040">[Pg 1040]</a></span></p>

<p>Two important matters were attended to at the meeting of the New York
Interscholastic Athletic Association last Tuesday. One was the question
which football rules shall govern the contests held under the
supervision of the association this fall, and the other was in regard to
the formation of a National Interscholastic Amateur Athletic
Association.</p>

<p>There was so much business of immediate local importance for the
association to transact that it was not until late in the afternoon that
the question of organizing the National I.S.A.A.A. could be brought up.
But when it was brought up the representatives of the schools were
unanimous in their opinion that the scheme should be put through, and it
was immediately voted that the matter be taken up by the association,
sitting as a committee of the whole, at their next meeting. The first
step in the matter has now been taken, and we may consequently look
forward confidently to a new and brilliant era in the history of school
sports.</p>

<p>As to the football rules, but little discussion was necessary. The
constitution of the N.Y.I.S.A.A. specifies that all games of the
N.Y.I.S.F.B.A. shall be played under the rules of the Inter-collegiate
F.B.A., and as that association this year consists merely of Yale and
Princeton, the New York school games will be conducted according to the
newly made Yale-Princeton or Inter-collegiate regulations. As this code
is, beyond any doubt, the best one of the three at present in use, it is
fortunate that the constitution of the N.Y.I.S.A.A. was so worded as to
provide for their adoption.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that if a National Interscholastic A.A.A. be formed, a
team of athletes from the Oakland High-School in California will come on
to compete at the first meeting. They are thoroughly in earnest out
there. A couple of weeks ago I quoted from the San Francisco papers,
which contained more or less accurate reports of these young sportsmen's
intentions, but since then I have received a copy of the <i>High-School
&AElig;gis</i>, Oakland High-School's paper in which there is an article entitled
"The Prospective Eastern Trip." It is too long to quote entire in these
columns, but a few paragraphs from it cannot fail to be of interest. The
article begins by saying that,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Through the efforts of <span class="smcap">Harper's Round Table</span>, a United States
Interscholastic Athletic Association bids fair to be formed, and
if the consolidation takes place, the first field day will be held
at New York city in June, 1896. The association will consist of
all academies, preparatory and high schools in the United States
which are of enough prominence in athletics to be eligible. It
will be a far greater organization in point of numbers than the
Inter-collegiate Association. New England will have thirty schools
represented, New York eighteen, Long Island five, and Pennsylvania
twelve, besides many other schools in different parts of the
country."</p></div>

<p>The <i>&AElig;gis</i> is certainly correct in saying that, in point of numbers, the
National I.S.A.A.A. would be greater than the I.C.A.A.A. New England
would certainly have more than thirty schools represented, for there are
thirty schools in the N.E.I.S.A.A. alone, and many important
institutions outside the organization that would certainly join. There
are also the Maine, the Connecticut, the Western Massachusetts, the New
York State, the Pittsburg, the Cook County (Illinois), the Dartmouth,
and many other associations, which, by joining, would bring the
membership, reckoned in schools, up to the hundreds.</p>

<p>In view of such a representative gathering of the schools of this
country, the <i>&AElig;gis</i> is perfectly justified in remarking that "the school
which wins the meet at Mott Haven next June will be the champion
academic school of the world; truly a great distinction." And
continuing, it asks: "Why should not the Oakland High-School be this
school? We have good athletes, who are capable of upholding the honor of
the school in any kind of company and on any field." With such a spirit
as this the Oakland athletes cannot fail to be prominent in any contest
they may enter.</p>

<p>The general plan of the trip East, to be made by the O.H.-S. team, is to
come directly to New York vi&acirc; Denver and Chicago. The present idea is to
reach here early in June, and to arrange a series of dual games with
some of the larger schools. Says the <i>&AElig;gis</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The crack schools of the East, with which the O.H.-S. team would
compete, are Andover and Worcester academies in New England, and
Barnard School of New York. A comparison of their records with the
records of those athletes now in school, in addition to the
probable records of the next field day, shows that we do not
suffer by the contrast. The fact must be also taken into
consideration, that we have nearly a year to improve in, which the
Eastern schools do not have, their track athletics ending with the
spring term, while ours continue into winter. The time in the
220-yard dash and 220-yard hurdle race is made straightaway, while
our records are made on a curved track, and a very poor one at
that. The difference in time is nearly a second and a half, which
brings our record in the 220-yard dash down to about 23-4/5
seconds, which is very good."</p></div>

<p>The return trip might be made over the Northern route, if the O.H.-S.
team can arrange for games with the Multnomah A.C. of Portland, Oregon.</p>

<p>The amount of money necessary to defray all the expenses that would be
incurred in coming East is estimated by the California athletes at
$2500. They propose to collect this sum from the members and <i>alumni</i> of
the school, from an entertainment to be given, and from contributions by
the business men of Oakland. They also count on making some profit from
their share of the gate receipts at the various games in which the team
will compete. Again, I cannot urge too strongly upon the leaders of
athletics in our Eastern schools the desirability and advisability of
encouraging these California sportsmen to come East. It will give
interscholastic sport a great boom in every way, and raise the standard
and importance of school contests. I have no doubt whatever that, as
soon as the Eastern trip of the O.H.-S. team is definitely decided upon,
Andover, Worcester, Hartford H.-S., Barnard, Cutler, and many other
schools will be eager to arrange dates for dual games.</p>

<p>There is such a great number of school football teams in and about
Boston, that it is impossible, of course, to include them all in one
association. Even the original I.S.F.B.A. has found it necessary to
divide itself into a Senior and a Junior League, so great was its
membership. And so, as rapidly as new teams crop up and find there is no
room for them in existing associations, they will form new organizations
themselves, and eventually, no doubt, the great scholastic games of the
year will be between the winning elevens of different associations, just
as the principal scholastic football game hereabouts is that between the
teams representing the New York I.S.F.B.A. and the Long Island
I.S.F.B.A.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1042" id="Page_1042">[Pg 1042]</a></span></p>

<p>The Suburban High-School League is second in importance, in the
neighborhood of Boston, only to the old association made up of the
Boston and Cambridge schools. It is only a year old, but it is in a
thriving condition, the principal schools of its membership being the
Medford, Malden, Melrose, and Winchester High-Schools. The championship
last year, the first of the League's existence, was won by Malden H.-S.,
whose team defeated Medford H.-S., 10-0, in the final game of the
season. This fall the Suburban League teams will start playing their
championship games on November 2d, when Medford and Winchester meet at
Medford, and Malden and Melrose come together at Melrose. The two
winning teams will decide the championship on the 9th.</p>

<p>The Malden H.-S. team is in better condition at this early date than any
of its rivals in the League. Captain Flanders, who has been a member of
the team for three years, is putting his men through a course of
training that is developing all there is in them. He is a capable player
himself, having held almost every position on the team. In his first
year he was used in the rush line, and finally occupied one end. The
next year he went in at right half-back, and this season he will play
full-back. He is a strong runner, and is better at half than anywhere
else; although at full he will probably do a good deal of running with
the ball, and play close up as a sort of third half-back most of the
time. Swain at left guard has also played three years on the team. He is
the heaviest man in the aggregation, and there is no better man in the
League at breaking through or making holes. Priest will leave end and go
to right half-back, and Atwood will be taken from the line, too, to go
in as Priest's partner. Both men will require considerable coaching, but
Atwood is a fast sprinter, and ought to turn out well in his new
position.</p>

<p>The Medford H.-S. team is made up mostly of new men, but it is full of
good material. Captain McPherson has had experience on the team for two
years, and will have good control over his men, his position being at
quarter. But he has a hard row to hoe, and will deserve no end of credit
if he moulds all this awkward and green energy into a team of players by
November 2d. At Melrose the prospects are but little better. The new men
are light, and most of them are inexperienced, only two ever having
played on school teams before. These two, Harris and Libby, will no
doubt take care of the ends, as they seem best fitted for those
positions. If necessary, Libby can go in at quarter. The material back
of the line is unusually light, even for a school team. Bemis, however,
is a hard runner, and tackles well, and will no doubt be the regular
full-back. The other candidates are a little slow in their work, and are
much in need of vigorous coaching. They could well spend an hour of
every morning in passing and falling on the ball.</p>

<p>There is good material at Winchester, although only three of last year's
eleven are again in school. The lack of old players, however, is amply
compensated for by the enthusiasm of the new, and I shall expect to see
Winchester well up toward the top of the ladder at the end of the
season. Ordway, the Captain and full-back, has played on the team two
years, and is a good man to give the ball to. He gets around the ends in
good style, and is not afraid of bucking the centre. Thus far the
candidates are playing well together, although they are a little slow at
breaking up interference, and sometimes fail to follow the ball as
closely as they should. In a word, their aggressive play is better than
their defensive work. The latter should receive attention.</p>

<p>Andover's play in the recent game against Boston College was quick and
snappy, and of a kind that may well give Lawrenceville some anxiety. P.&nbsp;A.
rolled up 22 points in two fifteen-minute halves, and came pretty
near scoring four more as time was called. The Boston men were heavier,
but lacked the training which clearly characterized Andover's work.
Douglass was put in at half in place of Goodwin, who is temporarily laid
up, and made the star play of the game. It occurred at the opening of
the second half. Andover kicked off, and Boston returned it. Douglass
caught the ball about in the centre of the field, and ran. He dodged
half the Boston team, and crossed the line for a touch-down. Butterfield
did good work likewise, making several gains through the line. The
Andover men seemed to have no trouble in making holes in the Boston
College line, and after each play the forwards were noticeably quick in
lining up. Andover is going to have a good team.</p>

<p>The Exeter eleven is pretty well knocked out. Half the men who were in
good shape two weeks ago are more or less seriously injured now, and it
is probable that the P.E.A. team this year will be as poor a one as has
represented the school for some time. This condition of affairs is due
not so much to poor material as to bad judgment on the part of the
captain and the manager. Before the team was in any condition to perform
such hard work, games were arranged with Tufts College, Boston A.A.,
M.I.T., and Dartmouth. Each one of these teams was heavier than the
Exeter eleven, and as a result several P.E.A. men are limping about the
Academy grounds, and one or two men will not play football again this
fall. The game against Dartmouth, especially, was hard for Exeter. In
bucking the Hanover rush-line five of P.E.A.'s best men were hurt.</p>

<p>The most serious loss was Hawkins, the quarter-back. The other men
behind the line had come to depend considerably upon him, and when
Martin was put in his place they went to pieces. Perhaps they should be
not too severely blamed for this, for Martin is a wretched player and
ought never to be allowed at quarter-back again until he learns a good
deal more about the game. In the Tufts game Martin passed the ball on
more than one occasion to his opponents. When Thomas took his place in
the second half there was a slight recovery from the previous
demoralization, but P.E.A. did no scoring. If Exeter had arranged her
games against lighter and weaker teams in the early part of the season,
and had fixed the dates with these older men for now and the following
weeks, her players would have been better able to stand the hard work
required of them.</p>

<p>It is just this sort of thing that brings football into disrepute with
people who don't know anything about the game. They see in the papers
that Brown, Jones, and Robinson are hurt as a result of playing
football. They do not stop to reflect that possibly Brown, Jones, and
Robinson had no business playing the game, but at once decry football.
Possibly if Brown, Jones, and Robinson had been put on horseback and
trotted around a field they would have been much lamer, and certainly
they would have been much more liable to get their necks broken. Take
two elevens in training and let them play a game; there will be no one
hurt in all probability. Take twenty-two men who are not in any kind of
training and set them loose on a gridiron for two fifteen-minute halves
and see how many doctors you will need at the end of the game. That's
the secret of most of the outcry against football. Half the men who get
hurt would not have gotten hurt if they had gone at it properly, and it
is almost always of these fellows that the general public gets reports.
There is a good deal for the general public to learn about football.</p>

<p>There is one good thing I notice in the methods of the Chicago
High-School teams. They play only fifteen-minute halves in their
football matches, and that is a very proper arrangement for the early
part of the season. Young players cannot stand the strain of full-time
play at first, and it is the height of folly to try to play two
thirty-five-minute halves at present. Even the big college teams do not
attempt such severe work, playing usually twenty or twenty-five minute
halves until the 1st of November, by which time the men have become
seasoned, and are able to stand the exertion of full-time play. School
teams should begin by playing short halves, gradually lengthening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1043" id="Page_1043">[Pg 1043]</a></span> them
until the full time is reached two or three weeks before the important
game. At first it is even better to play three periods of ten minutes,
with a short rest between each, than two fifteen-minute halves with only
one rest. It all depends on the size and strength of the men who are
playing, and the Captain must be the judge in these matters. His idea
should be to get the greatest development with the smallest possible
strain on his men.</p>

collectors, and the Editor will be pleased to answer any question
on these subjects so far as possible. Correspondents should
address Editor Stamp Department.</p></div>

<p>The dull season just ended has been extremely interesting from the fact
that a large number of stamps have been advancing in value by leaps and
bounds. So many new collectors have come into the field that the supply
of scarce and rare stamps has been much smaller than the demand. This
has been the case especially in unused U.S. stamps to such a degree that
dealers have refused to sell, calculating that they would make more
money by holding off. The Department stamps have scored the greatest
advance. The Executives, sold a few years ago for $4 or $5 per set,
command $25 to $30 to-day. The Justice set, which could be bought for $8
or $10 a set, are difficult to find at $80 or $90. Even the despised
Interior, worth formerly 75c. to $1 per set, now bring $5 to $6. A fine
set of State formerly owned by the writer, and sold for $40 in 1891,
changed hands the other day at $250.</p>

<p>In a word collectors with money&mdash;bankers, merchants, noblemen, and even
royalties&mdash;have greatly increased in numbers during the past three
years, whereas there are no more unused U.S. stamps to-day than
formerly. Indeed, there are fewer stamps on the market, as there is a
constant destruction of old albums and collections, through fire, water,
and carelessness.</p>

<p>Used stamps are not appreciated to as great an extent as unused, as the
great demand has led to the looking over of every lot of old letters
within the reach and knowledge of collectors. Consequently the common
varieties of U.S. stamps and envelopes are somewhat of a drug in the
market, and are bought by dealers to-day chiefly on the chance of
finding one or more of the scarcer kinds in the lot of "cheap trash."</p>

<p>I was mistaken in my opinion that the recent find of a big lot of St.
Louis stamps would bring down their price. The exact contrary has been
the effect. Two or three of our largest collectors are ready to buy
these stamps at an increased valuation, as they are now "plating." That
is, they are making up sheets of these stamps as originally issued. As
there were two papers and three plates, and each plate contained six
stamps, to make up a complete set would require thirty-six stamps in
all. The cost of such a set of six plates of six stamps each would
probably be at least $15,000, possibly $20,000.</p>

<p>The new catalogues are appearing. The first in the field was Seuf's,
then Stanley Gibbon's; the next to appear will probably be Scott's.
Meanwhile J.&nbsp;W. Scott has issued a circular of the new prices of the U.&nbsp;S.
issues, and probably will soon issue a new edition of "Our
Catalogue," which was the first ever made in the handy pocket form.</p>

<p>From Benefit Street and Olney Street, Providence, to the Boston Common
is forty-seven miles, and this is the distance to be run on the sixth
and last stage of the two-Hundred-and-Fifty-eight-mile trip from New
York to Boston. Wherever you may put up in Providence, it is well to
make for Benefit Street first on starting for Boston. Thence proceed,
and turn into Olney Street, following this to East Avenue, when the run
to Pawtucket is direct, and it is a capital four-mile run at that. The
rider will do well, after crossing the river, to bear to the right, and,
crossing the Massachusetts border, run into Lebanon Mills, just on the
Massachusetts side. Or to be more explicit, after leaving Pawtucket turn
to the left, cross a stone bridge, bear to the left immediately after
crossing, then take the next left fork, and finally bear to the right at
the third fork, and make for Lebanon Mills direct. Take Cottage Street
out of Lebanon, and turn to the right at the cemetery, and follow the
main road to Hebronville. Thence the road is clear through Dodgeville
across the track to Attleborough. From Attleborough, crossing the river,
you take the left turn at Fourth Street, and run direct, though by a
somewhat roundabout road, to West Mansfield, which is a good twenty
miles from Providence. From West Mansfield run northward, keep to the
right, cross the track, and run into Mansfield Junction. Crossing
tracks, run on to East Foxborough, and thence leaving Sharon on the
westward, proceed to East Sharon. The rider should take care to turn to
the right at the railroad round-house near Massapoag Pond, and avoid
running on into Sharon. From Cobb's Tavern at East Sharon the run to
Canton is direct and very good, as is also the road from Canton to
Ponkapog, though you should take care to take the right fork a mile and
a half out from Cobb's Tavern, and a mile and a half further on to turn
sharp left at a crossroads. From Ponkapog the rider runs on by Blue Hill
on Blue Hill Avenue, passing down through Mattapan to Warren Street, and
on this to Harrison Avenue, to Chester Park, to Columbus, to Boston
Common. The following are the directions by the road from Boston. The
reverse trip to Providence is given, because it is one of the good runs
out of Boston.</p>

<p>Starting at Copley Square, leave Public Library on the right, and go out
Huntington Avenue to Parker Street; there turn to the left, following
Parker to Tremont, there turn to the left onto Tremont, and at New Heath
Street turn to right, at Parker Street turn to left, and follow it to
Centre Street, turn to right onto Centre, and take direct road to
Jamaica Plain, continue till monument is reached, then take South Street
to the left of monument, and on reaching water-trough turn to the left,
cross over the railroad tracks, and turn to the right onto Walkhill
Street to the fork, where keep to right onto Hyde Park Avenue, which
follow till it joins Central Park Avenue. Continue on last-named avenue
to River Street, and then turn to right. Ride across the square, and go,
vi&acirc; Centre Street and River Street, to Milton Street, turn to the right.
Turn to left at High Street, on reaching Washington Street take that
past Memorial Hall, Dedham, to Norwood, past Public Library, and at fork
of roads keep to right into Walpole, where, at the Common near Town
Hall, turn to the left, and after a run of a quarter of a mile turn to
the right, and from the turnpike-road turn to the right to South
Walpole.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1045" id="Page_1045">[Pg 1045]</a></span> In leaving this village keep to left, and take East Foxborough
road, but on reaching Common bear to right, and turn to right into South
Street, and go to forks, where take the left fork to the turn of the
road, then turn to the right and cross Wading River, and after passing
reservoir you reach forks, take left one to end, then turn to right onto
Pleasant Street, which follow to Park Street. Turn to right and cross
railroad, continuing to fountain, turn to left onto South Main Street to
car track, and follow car track to Hebronville, cross Lebanon Bridge,
keep straight road vi&acirc; Central Avenue, following car tracks to Six
Corners, there take left fork with car tracks and Cottage Street to
junction of car tracks. In Pawtucket turn to left on Summit Street, take
first right, Main Street, keeping to left at the forks, then first left
onto School Street, and bear to right at forks to the first cross
street, turn to right onto Division Street, and cross the river, turn to
left onto Pleasant Street, the continuation of which is Seven Point
Road, take first left beyond cemetery, then follow Blackstone Boulevard
to the end, and continue vi&acirc; of Butler Avenue, following car tracks, and
turning to right at Angell Street, pass the asylum wall, take third
street to left, follow Cook Street, turn to right onto Benevolent
Street, right onto Benefit Street, turn to left onto College Street, and
down hill into Market Square.</p>

<h3>MOUNTING PICTURES FOR THE PRIZE COMPETITION.</h3>

<p>Although directions for mounting prints have been given in this column,
still a few extra hints may not come amiss to our competitors.</p>

<p>The mounting of pictures has a great deal to do with their artistic
finish, and as technical excellence is one of the points on which the
prize pictures are to be marked, of course the mounting of the pictures
is included in this term.</p>

<p>There are many styles of card-mounts, and in selecting a mount be sure
that the color of the card harmonizes with the color of the print. Do
not use a gray mount for pictures with warm brown tones. A creamy-white
is the color that is best adapted to most prints. A very attractive
card-mount is what is called a "plate-sunk" mount. The card has a
depression in the centre a little larger than the print to be mounted,
and has the effect of a frame. This card is of heavy board and rather
expensive, yet it pays to buy a good card-mount for prize competition
pictures.</p>

<p>Never mount a print on a card only a trifle larger than the print. The
picture should have at least an inch-wide margin all round. A 4&nbsp;x&nbsp;5
print should be mounted on a 6&nbsp;x&nbsp;8 card, and larger prints on
correspondingly larger cards. Do not use what is called a 4&nbsp;x&nbsp;5
card-mount for a 4&nbsp;x&nbsp;5 picture. If you have never used a larger mount
than one which just fits the picture try an unmounted print on a large
sheet of plain paper, and see how much the picture gains in beauty by
having a wider margin to the mount.</p>

<p>A nice way to mount prints for exhibition is to first mount the print on
a plain card, and then place a mat over it of rough water-color paper,
or such paper as is used to mat pictures. In using a mat do not trim the
photograph; mount it in the centre of the card, and then place the mat
over it.</p>

<p>Mount your pictures in as neat and attractive manner as possible, and
see if it does not raise your standard of "technical excellence."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Sir Knight Fred. P. Moore</span> asks if there is any way to fix a
defective plate that has holes or scratches on the film; if
chemicals can be bought at drug stores, and are they cheaper or
dearer than those bought of the photograph dealers; and would also
like the formula for paste given over again. A negative that has
scratches in the film can have the holes or scratches filled up in
this way: apply retouching fluid to the spots in manner directed
on bottle. When it is dry take a soft lead-pencil and mark or
pencil out the spots, filling them with the soft lead. Be careful
not to mark any place except where the holes and scratches are, as
all such marks will show in the print. It is best to experiment
with a spoiled negative first before attempting to retouch a good
plate. A little practice and a steady hand will soon enable an
amateur to retouch the spots in his negatives so that the print
will show a perfect picture. It is much cheaper to buy
photographic chemicals at the regular dealers; for instance, I
bought 5 grs. of ferricyanide of potassium at the druggist last
week for which I paid ten cents, and a few days later bought an
ounce at the dealers in photographic goods for which I paid ten
cents. Druggists keep good chemicals, but they charge more for
them. The formula for paste is as follows: 1 oz. best arrowroot,
40 grs. sheet gelatine, 1/2 oz. methylated spirits, 3 drops of
carbolic acid. Mix the arrowroot with 1 oz. of water, then add 7
oz. of water and the gelatine broken in bits. Boil for five
minutes, stirring all the time, and when nearly cold stir in the
spirits slowly, and then the acid. Keep tightly corked, and when
wanted for use take out a little and rub smooth with a knife.</p></div>

<h2>Conditions for the "Word Hunt."</h2>

<p>Following is a list of answers to some questions which have been put to
us concerning the $50 "Word Hunt." Many asked the same questions, but we
endeavor to answer all the different ones in the following:</p>

<p>No other authorities than Webster or Worcester may be used. Words that
are marked "obsolete" in the Dictionary may not be used, neither may
compound words. One letter may not be used twice unless it appears twice
in the Puzzle Words. The letter "a" is a word. By proper names is meant
not only given names of persons, but any words that must be commenced
with a capital letter.</p>

<p>Prefixes and suffixes may not be used except when they form part of a
simple word. Words of the same meaning but spelled differently are
allowable, but words of different meanings and spelled alike are not.
The possessive case, diphthongs, slang words, abbreviations, and
contractions are not allowable. Degrees of comparison, the different
forms of the verb, and plurals that are formed otherwise than by adding
"s" are allowable, also words in the Appendix.</p>

<p>Words derived from the Latin or Greek may be used, but words commonly
used, yet purely foreign, may not. All the letters contained in the
Puzzle Words need not be used; each word may contain any number of
letters, no matter how few, so long as they form a word. One person may
try for only one prize&mdash;senior or junior.</p>

<p>All are invited to compete, whether subscribers or not. If you are not a
member of the Order of the Round Table, write to the publishers for a
Membership Patent. We request that answers be written on one side of the
paper only, and that each word be numbered. Write the words in
alphabetical order, as far as possible, and do not roll the sheets, but
send them either <i>flat</i> or <i>folded</i>.</p>

<h2>A Delightful Morsel from South Africa.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Winter is almost over. We have had a very warm one. Spring is not
supposed to come until September, but already the trees are
getting quite green, and birds and butterflies are coming back. We
very seldom see snow at Roydon, and have had none this winter, but
we are having a fearful drought. It is over a year since we had
rain. The farmers are looking very anxious about their crops.</p>

<p>In October the "shearing" begins. You meet everywhere bands of
Kafirs in their red blankets, knob-herries (sticks with a huge
knob at one end, usually carried by natives) in their hands, and a
bundle containing a pot, tin beaker, shears, and sometimes boots,
slung over their shoulders; these are "shearers." The farmers hire
them at the rate of about sixpence (twelve cents) for ten sheep.
Not much, is it? but the Kafirs are easily satisfied.</p>

<p>The sheep are put into an enclosure. Each Kafir, stripped to the
waist, seizes one and commences to shear the wool off. Sometimes
they are careless and cut the flesh. Then a man standing by dips a
brush in tar and rubs the place over. This not only heals it, but
keeps the flies off. As soon as a shearer has finished a sheep he
receives a "loikee" (bean or something of that sort). At the end
of the day he receives payment according to the amount of loikees
in his possession.</p>

<p>The wool is packed into large bales and is sold by the pound.
Dealers send the bales by rail to the seaports, where they are
shipped to England, and come back to us in the shape of clothes.
It is just as well to keep to windward of the shearing-house. Not
being addicted to water, the Kafirs have an odor peculiarly their
own. As I once heard it remarked, "it is enough to knock a fellow
down," if you go too near.</p>

<p>We sell a great deal of fruit in the summer. Our fruit ripens
then, not in autumn. Early in the morning the men begin to pick
and pack the fruit. In 1893 we sold 9100 apricots, 10,718
plums&mdash;which includes New Orleans, Golden Drop, Magnum Bosum,
Damsons, Greengages, and the common blue plum&mdash;and 16,243 peaches
and nectarines, besides hundreds of apples, pears, and figs. In
the winter we have oranges, lemons, shaddocks, and citrons. Our
winter fruit was a failure this year on account of the drought.</p>

<p>We send most of our fruit to East London, where it has a ready
sale. In their season we have loquats, granadillas, and walnuts.
We almost live on fruit in the summer. The weather is unbearably
hot. Last Christmas day was very hot, and all we felt inclined to
do was to lie about in the shade and drink cooling drinks. As
evening approaches we get merry again. It is cool almost as soon
as the sun sets. We have no twilight to speak of. It is lovely
out-of-doors in the evening. We promenade up and down and watch
the stars.</p>

<p>My friend, Douglas Ritchie, who is thirteen years of age, has
started a stamp collection. He would like to exchange South
African stamps for those of other countries. He is also very
anxious to join the Round Table. Will you send him a Patent,
please? His address is The Manse, Queenstown, Cape Colony, South
Africa. My letter is getting so long that I must conclude. Will
you please give my love to dear Mrs. Sangster, and tell her I do
enjoy the "Pudding Stick" so much.</p></div>

<span style="margin-left: 32em;"><span class="smcap">Roydon, Queenstown, Cape Colony, South Africa</span>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Of course we'll send the Patent. Mrs. Sangster thanks you warmly, and is
much gratified to learn that you so greatly enjoy her Pudding Stick. She
gives you, her distant but not less dear reader, her most cordial
greeting. Won't you write another just as good morsel as this one?</p>

<h2>Directions for Playing "Newcomb."</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I have had so much fun from the following game that I am induced
to give it to the Table. We boys of Trinity School, N.&nbsp;Y., were
the first to play it in this vicinity. I think it was originated
by a lady gymnastic teacher in New Orleans, who wished to devise
some good healthful game requiring not too much exertion.</p>

<p>Two lines are drawn, one on each side of the gymnasium, about ten
or twelve feet from the wall. Two sides are chosen. Each takes its
place inside the line. A referee and score-keeper are appointed.
The referee tosses a football (a Rugby is the best) to one of the
teams. The man on the team receiving the ball throws it to the
opposing team, his object being to throw the ball so that it will
fall behind the other team's line. If he scores a touch-down&mdash;that
is, if it goes inside the line, it counts three points to the side
throwing the ball. If the ball does not fall inside, but outside
the line, it counts a foul, and scores a point against the side
throwing it.</p>

<p>If a member of either team, whether he is receiving or throwing
the ball, steps over or on the line, it constitutes a foul, and
scores one point against his side. Of course the swifter the ball
is thrown the more unlikely any member of the opposing team is to
catch it. A certain length of time to play had better be agreed
upon. I nearly forgot to mention that two lines must be drawn at
right angles to the principal ones&mdash;that is, a line at each end.
Should the ball go outside these lines it is a foul. These rules
can be perfected and enlarged according to any one's desire.</p>

<p>I give a diagram showing how the lines should be drawn, and how
the men could be arranged, if desired. This diagram is for a team
of ten men. The game is called Newcomb.</p></div>

<h2>Entertainments for the Fund.</h2>

<p>Not a few fairs and entertainments are planned for the near future in
aid of the School Fund. There are to be fairs at Newton, N.&nbsp;J.; Upper
Nyack, N.&nbsp;Y.; and Edgecombe Road, New York city; and stereopticon
entertainments in Washington, Louisville, Dayton, and Piqua, O.; Easton,
Pa.; Somerville, Perth Amboy, and East Orange, N.&nbsp;J.; Brooklyn and
Utica, N.&nbsp;Y.; Newport, R.&nbsp;I.; and, a little later on, Cincinnati, O.
Besides, Mr. Kirk Munroe is to give a reading and reception in New York
city.</p>

<p>Why may not there be held, at or near the holidays this year, say early
in December, a great number of fairs? Mr. Munroe's letter describing his
visit to Good Will Farm has aroused much interest. It explains all about
the work there. If you are interested, send to us for a copy. It will be
sent you free. Write us about any proposed effort in your town. Suppose
we hear from three or four persons in one town? We immediately bring you
together and there is a working force all ready to hand. Besides, we can
help you with suggestions&mdash;possibly with an entertainment all ready to
your hand. How many can we hear from?</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>The Helping Hand.</h2>

<p>The truth of the Table's adage that "everything comes to those who try"
was strikingly illustrated recently. Some Ladies of Newton, N.&nbsp;J.,
planned a fair in aid of the School Fund. Of course it was a delightful
occasion. There was much hard work, and there were some disappointments,
but the splendid sum of $30 was netted. Those who had the great pleasure
of giving this amount to the Fund were:</p>

<p>Helen Leyton, Mabel T. Roof, Eleanor Hayward, Mollie Morford, Katherine
Atwood, Emma Howard, Edna L. Roof, Mary S. Roof, Harry Howard, Waldemar
Howard, Louis Layton, Harry Lubbs, Clarence Howard, Thomas S. Woodruff.</p>

<p>At about the same time some other Ladies in the upper part of New York
city held a fair. They, too, had hard work and some discouragements, but
then, like the Ladies of Newton, they enjoyed a great deal of
satisfaction in the end, for they were able to send to the Fund $71.50.
The Table most heartily thanks all who helped at these two fairs. It
also urges other Ladies, Chapters, and all readers to try to hold fairs
for the same purpose. Let us have one hundred fairs and entertainments
this autumn and winter. Then we shall surely lay the corner-stone of the
building early in the spring. Write the Table for suggestions, or see
the Handy Book.</p>

<h2>More Chutes to Shoot.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>An interesting article appeared in the <span class="smcap">Round Table</span> on "Shooting
the Chutes." The writer mentioned that there were four "Chutes" in
different parts of the country. There are two more, which have
probably been erected since the article was written, one at
Washington Park, Philadelphia, and the other at Atlantic City.
They were both erected this year. The one at Atlantic City was the
attraction of the season and a wonderful financial success. It
earned the whole cost of its construction, $35,000. There will
doubtless be another one next year, for people do not seem to tire
of the exhilarating sport.</p></div>

<h2>An Appeal from Australia.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We live on Red Hill, a suburb of Brisbane. We have a very nice
view from our place, and in summer a nice breeze springs up which
mitigates the intense heat of the day, while in winter it is
rather cold. We go to a state school, called the "Normal." We
would like to correspond with some girl of our own age (thirteen
years) from any foreign country. Here is the address for any girl
who would like to write, Venie Lawson and Annette Wilson, Normal
School, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.</p></div>

<h2>Let's have Some Explanations.</h2>

<p>After Jotaphat had been captured by the Romans, Josephus, the historian,
fled to a cavern with forty other Jews. His companions resolved to kill
each other rather than surrender. Josephus pretended to agree, but
claimed that, being leader, it was his privilege to arrange them in good
order for death, and that, beginning to count from one end to a certain
number, they should put to death the person on whom that number should
fall, until only one man should remain, who should kill himself. The men
agreed, and Josephus so arranged himself and the forty others that at
the end of the slaughter he remained, with one other, whom he persuaded
to live. How did Josephus arrange his men?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1047" id="Page_1047">[Pg 1047]</a></span></p>

<p>I take it for granted that it is a class prophecy which my
correspondent, who is puzzled on this score, asks for. Here is one way
which she may like. Write your prophecy as though seen by the Lady of
Shalott, and illustrate by tableaux-vivants. The prophet costumes
herself like the Lady of Shalott. She should wear a gauzy white gown,
and have a netting wound around her, assimilating a spider's web. Her
hair should flow loosely about the shoulders, and she should be seated
before a spinning-wheel.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 21em;">"And so she weaveth steadily,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 21em;">And little other care hath she."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Arrange the platform to represent a prettily furnished room, and on the
wall hang conspicuously a large mirror.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 21em;">"And moving thro' a minor clear</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 21em;">That hangs before her all the year,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 21em;">Shadows of the world appear."</span><br />
</p>

<p>The Lady of Shalott as she weaves recites in slow, distinct tones the
prophecy, and as the destiny of each one is told, have the person
referred to pass across the stage before the mirror, and so on, out of
sight. The person will be costumed and will act exactly as the prophecy
foretells. The awesome effect will be heightened by an accompaniment of
slow music.</p>

<p>A very little girl asks what easy thing she may find to do for her
mother's birthday. Make a set of table-mats, dear, of coarse white
cotton, crocheting them in simple close work, and finishing with a
scalloped edge. I saw a very pretty set the other day, and the lady who
owned them was proud that her youngest daughter, aged eight, had made
them herself.</p>

<p>What do you think of this as a hint for a useful little gift? A Portia
pen-wiper is practical, unique, new, and easy of construction. Buy a
china doll&mdash;one that stands firmly. Make for her several chamois-skin
skirts of different lengths, putting on the shortest one first. Pink the
edges. The costume should be a red or black student's gown and cap, and
put a tiny roll of parchment in her hand. If you have to tie the roll in
the hand, use fine silk of the same color as the parchment, and it will
scarcely show. The gown should be long and full. The material may be
silk, velvet, or cashmere. The cap should have a square top, fastened to

<p>No, Susie and Rowana. I do not care for crystallized grasses. They are
old-fashioned, and not in the least pretty. Do not put anything in your
vases which simply gathers dust, and is not a thing of beauty. A few
growing plants are a great attraction in the house, and you can have
geraniums and mignonette all winter if you will begin to care for them
now.</p>

<h2>NOT A WEATHER INDICATOR.</h2>

<p>An amusing story is told by a sea-captain in relation to the ignorance
of his steward, whom he had directed to wind the chronometer in the
cabin every morning regularly during his contemplated absence from the
ship.</p>

<p>Now a chronometer is nothing but a finely regulated timepiece used by
navigators. On its face is a small circle having a hand, and at two
points on this circle are the words "Up" and "Wind." When the instrument
is wound the little arrow-band points to "Up," and after the chronometer
has run twenty-four hours the arrow stands against "Wind," meaning that
it is time for it to be wound.</p>

<p>When the Captain returned to his ship, the steward reported to him that
he had obeyed orders, and wound the chronometer faithfully every day,
and then added that he, personally, did not think much of its ability to
foretell weather.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked the puzzled Captain. "What has a chronometer
got to do with the weather?"</p>

<p>"Why," replied the manipulator of sailors' hash and plum-duff, "every
morning the arrow would say that we were going to have wind, and half
the time it was a flat calm."</p>

<p>"I don't yike you, Aunt Jennie," said Wilbur, after his aunt had

<h2>JUST THE OTHER WAY.</h2>

<p>Jimmieboy has a very unbreakable habit of getting up at night and
running in to his father's room and jumping into bed with him. He was
once chided for this.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to have you come in the morning, but don't come too early,"
was the end of the lecture. The next night, however, Jimmieboy came
bouncing in at one o'clock.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you not to do this, Jimmieboy?" he was asked.</p>

<p>"No," replied Jimmieboy. "You told me not to come early. This isn't
early&mdash;it's awful late. After one o'clock."</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
