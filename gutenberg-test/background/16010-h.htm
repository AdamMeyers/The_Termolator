      PREFACE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      After the reader shall, have perused the annexed startling and
      extraordinary narrative, on which I have founded the tale of the
      Tithe-Proctor, I am sure he will admit that there is very little left me
      to say in the shape of a preface. It is indeed rarely, that ever a
      document, at once so authentic and powerful, has been found prefixed to
      any work of modern Irish Fiction&mdash;proceeding as it does, let me add,
      from the pen of a gentleman whose unassuming character and modesty are
      only surpassed by the distinction which his name has already gained in one
      of the most difficult but useful departments of our native literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      I trust that there will be found nothing in the work which follows that is
      calculated to give any serious offence. Yet, when we look back upon the
      contentions, both political and polemical, by which this unhappy country
      in connection with tithe especially, has been so frequently and so
      bitterly distracted, we can hardly hope, that any writer, however anxious,
      nay studious, to avoid giving offence, can expect to treat such a subject
      without incurring animosity in <i>some</i> quarter. Be this as it may, I
      have only to say, on behalf of myself, that in composing the work I was
      influenced by nothing but a firm and honest determination to depict the
      disturbances arising from the tithe impost with a fair and impartial hand:
      and if any party shall feel hurt by observations which the necessity of
      rendering full justice to a subject so difficult have imposed upon me in
      the discharge of a public duty, I beg them to consider that such
      observations proceeded from no wish to offend existing prejudices, but are
      to be looked upon as arising inferentially from those stern and
      uncompromising claims of truth and justice, which equally disregard the
      prejudices of any and every party. After all, I am of opinion that the
      spirit in which the work is written will be found, whilst it correctly
      delineates the state and condition of the country during the fearful
      tumults and massacres of the Tithe Rebellion, to have left little, if
      anything, to be complained of in this respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      In constructing narratives of this sort, it is to be understood that
      certain allowances are always made for small anachronisms that cannot be
      readily got over. The murder of the Bolands, for instance, occurred in the
      year 1808, and the massacre of Carrickshock, as it has been called, in
      1832. It was consequently impossible for me to have availed myself of the
      annexed "Narrative" and brought in the "Massacre" in the same story,
      without bringing down the murder of the Bolands to a more recent date.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be objected that I have assumed, as the period of my story, one
      which was calculated to bring into light and action the worst feelings and
      the darkest criminals of my country. This, however, was not my fault. If
      they had not existed, I could not have painted them; and so long as my
      country is disgraced by great crimes, and her social state disorganized by
      men whoso hardened vices bring shame upon civilization itself, so long, I
      add, these crimes and such criminals shall never be veiled over by me. I
      endeavor to paint Ireland, sometimes as she was, but always as she is, in
      order that she may see many of those debasing circumstances which prevent
      her from being what she ought to be. In the meantime, I trust the reader
      will have an opportunity of perceiving that I have not in the <i>Tithe-Proctor</i>,
      any more than in my other work, forgotten to show him that even in the
      most startling phases of Irish crime and tumult, I have by no means
      neglected to draw the warm, generous, and natural virtues of my
      countrymen, and to satisfy him that a very few guilty wretches are quite
      sufficient, however unjustly, to blacken and degrade a large district.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is, however, a certain class of pseudo-patriots in this country, who
      are of opinion that every writer, professing to depict our national
      character and manners, should make it a point of conscience to suppress
      all that is calculated "to lessen us in the eyes of the world," as they
      are pleased to term it, and only to give to the public the bright and
      favorable side. It is unnecessary to dwell upon the moral dishonesty and
      meanness of a principle, at once so disgraceful to literature and so
      repugnant to truth. These thin-skinned gentlemen are of opinion that the
      crime itself is a matter of trivial importance compared to the fact of its
      becoming known, and that provided the outside of the platter is kept
      clean, it matters not how filthy it may be within.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the days of my boyhood and early life, the people of Ireland were,
      generally speaking, an honest, candid, faithful, and grateful people, who
      loved truth, and felt the practical influence of religious feeling
      strongly, but so dishonest and degrading has been the long curse of
      agitation, to which forms of it their moral and social principles have
      been exposed, that there probably could not be found in any country, an
      instance in which the virtues of the whole people have been so completely
      debauched and contaminated (I do not say voluntarily), as those of the
      Irish have been by the leading advocates of repeal. The degeneracy of
      character, occasioned by those tampering with our national virtues, is
      such as we shall not recover from these thirty years to come. Many of our
      best, mellow-toned, old virtues, that pass in an unbroken link of
      hereditary beauty from father to son, and from family to family, like some
      sacred and inestimable heirloom, at once reverenced and loved, are all
      gone&mdash;such as our love of truth, our simple devotion and patriarchal
      piety, our sincerity in all social intercourse, and others of the same
      stamp; whilst little else is left us but a barren catalogue of broken and
      dishonest promises, and the consciousness of having been at once fleeced
      and laughed at. And it would be well if we could stop here, but truth
      forces us onward. The Irishman of the present day&mdash;the creature of
      agitation&mdash;is neither honest, nor candid, nor manly, nor generous,
      but a poor, skulking dupe, at once slavish and insolent, offensive and
      cowardly&mdash;who carries, as a necessary consequence, the principles of
      political dishonesty into the practices of private life, and is
      consequently disingenuous and fraudulent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me not be misunderstood. I love truth; and have never been either
      afraid or ashamed to speak it; and I trust I never shall. I now allude to
      the principles of Conciliation Hall, and the system by which they were
      led. I feel bound, however, to exempt the party called Young Irelanders
      from having had any participation in bringing about results so disastrous
      to the best moral interests of the country. It is true, that, as
      politicians, they were insane; but then they were at least sincere and
      honest; and I am satisfied that there is not a man of them, who would not
      have abandoned the object he had in view, sooner than accomplish it by
      sacrificing the popular virtues and moral character of the country for its
      attainment. I have myself been a, strong anti-repealer during my whole
      life, and though some of the Young Irelanders are my personal friends, yet
      none know better than they do, that I was strenuously opposed to their
      principles, and have often endeavored&mdash;need I say unsuccessfully?&mdash;to
      dissuade them from the madness of their agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having made these few necessary observations, I now beg to introduce to my
      readers the extraordinary narrative already spoken of&mdash;a narrative
      whose force and graphic power will serve only to bring shame upon the
      feeble superstructure which I have endeavored to erect upon it. It is
      termed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      THE MURDER OF THE BOLANDS.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the year 1808, there lived near Croom, in the county of Limerick, a
      farmer named Michael Boland. He was an intelligent and prosperous man, and
      the owner of many hundred acres of the best land in that fine county.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had two sons and two daughters, all grown up to manhood and womanhood,
      in this year, and the parish chapel never saw, in their time, a finer
      family for stature, symmetry, and comeliness, attend its mass than Michael
      Boland, his wife, and children. With the growth of his family, his
      ambition and desire of increased wealthiness grew; and, by the agency of
      some hundred pounds, he became the tithe-proctor, or rector of several
      patches of tithes throughout the county.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first he was successful in this speculation, and with his increased
      profits, himself and his children assumed a higher and more important tone
      and bearing in society. In fact, his sons and daughters passed as ladies
      and gentlemen, not only in external appearance, but in elegance of manners
      and cultivation of mind; for he spared no expense on their education, as
      well in his original as in his subsequent condition of life; besides that
      at this period, and for a long time previous, the County of Limerick was
      the great school-house, not only of Munster, but of all Ireland&mdash;vide
      Carleton's "Poor Scholar."
    </p>
    <p>
      The sudden departure of the Bolands from the intercourse and intimate
      acquaintance of their former companions and neighbors, as well as the long
      brooding hatred and opposition of the people to the payment of tithes,
      soon gave rise to loud murmurs and sarcastic retrospective observations
      against them; and people far and near took every occasion to offend and
      insult them&mdash;both men and women&mdash;-wherever and whenever an
      opportunity of doing so, in a galling manner, offered. Often were the
      Misses Boland asked, when mounted on their side-saddles, did they remember
      when their mother used to be driving her cart-load of tankards of sour
      milk to the market of Limerick, and sitting there for days retailing it at
      a penny a gallon, &amp;c.; and as often were the young brothers asked when
      bursting over an old neighbor's fence, in scarlet and buckskin, if they
      remembered when their father and mother bore an active hand and shoulder
      to the carving out and spreading of the manure to the fields, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far from being abashed at all this, the Bolands only sought ampler
      opportunities to annoy and exasperate their ill-wishers by more imperious
      airs to them, and a closer attendance to the gentlemanly sports of the
      country, but still they gave no tangible cause to quarrel broadly with
      them. While matters were going on in this way, they received a nocturnal
      anonymous letter, ordering them to send a few of their abundant stock of
      arms to a certain lonely place, for the benefit, of the popular
      legislators of that turbulent county. This summons the Bolands answered by
      a letter of defiance, and a challenge to the parties to come and take them
      forcibly if they durst. They were agan summoned for their arms, and
      cautioned to lower their demand for tithes. To this they sent an
      exasperating response of defiance, and a challenge, after which they
      seriously went about fortifying their dwelling, and putting it into the
      best posture of defence against the assault which they were very certain
      would be made on them sooner or later.
    </p>
    <p>
      They built a line of lofty strong stone walls around their house, offices,
      and other property, and, thus secure, they awaited anxiously the expected
      visit of their deadly enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime the messengers of vengeance passed through all the
      counties of Munster, with an account of the rebellious designs of the
      Bolands, against the majesty of midnight legislation; and to collect
      levies of men, ammunition, army, and friends, for the purpose of making a
      certain destructive attack upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, about the latter end of November, the roads and paths leading
      to the little village of Kilteely, a few miles to the east of Boland's
      house, was observed to be more than usually thronged with men, on foot and
      on horseback, passing, as it were, to and from Limerick, and strangers,
      apparently, to all the inhabitants and to each other. Shortly after
      nightfall, the hill of Kilteely was seen covered with men and horses, and
      within an old ruined house on the top of the hill a dim light was seen to
      occasionally flitter. This ruin was full of respectably dressed men, and
      at one end of it, on chairs, and at a table, provided for the occasion,
      sat twelve of the most respectable of them, and a portly important-looking
      gentleman on an elevated chair at the end of the table. Two or three
      candies were burning, and some slips of paper were on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a silence of a few seconds, the judge asked, in an audible voice, if
      there was any business to be brought before the court on that night? He
      was immediately answered in a solemn tone, by more than one voice, that
      there was a great deal of business, but that only one case, that of
      Captain Right against Boland, should be brought before him at that present
      time. The judge then desired that the case be gone into. Whereupon a
      middle-sized well-set young man, about six-and-twenty years of age, whose
      name we know, and who sat behind the judge, now brought his chair forward
      to the table, on the judge's left hand, and unrolling a roll of paper,
      read in a low, solemn, but audible tone of voice, a series of charges
      preferred by the said Captain Right against the said Michael Boland and
      his sons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain was then called up, and he deposed to different charges
      against the defendants&mdash;such as taking beforehand, or in reversion,
      several small farms over the heads of poor but solvent tenants, turning
      them adrift on the world, and converting their small agricultural farms
      into one or more large farms for grazing; thereby adding to the number of
      the destitute, and contracting the supply of agricultural produce&mdash;the
      payment to his laboring men of only eight-pence a day, which he compounded
      for in kind&mdash;potatoes, milk, &amp;c, at twice, at least, what those
      commodities fetched him in the neighboring markets. These were only a few
      of the many charges of petty tyranny preferred against Boland; but the
      last and greatest of all was his Tithe Exactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several witnesses were called up to prove these weighty offences, after
      which it was asked if the accused party had been served with notices to
      desist from those high misdemeanors; and if he had engaged any one to
      speak for him, or in his favor. After a short pause, a man above the
      middle size, with snaggy hair and beard, and of a sinister aspect, came up
      to the table and said, that although he had not been employed or deputed
      to appear for Mr. Boland and the young masters and misses, his fine sons
      and daughters, yet justice to the accused compelled him to come forward,
      and offer a few words in extenuation of the punishment, if any, which
      should be inflicted for their alleged misdeeds. "First, then," he asked,
      "was it possible that they, the men then present, should be angry or
      offended at seeing one of their own race and religion spring up from among
      them, and take his station with the best of the Cromwellian Shoneens that
      surrounded and oppressed them? And when he did so spring up, was it any
      blame to him to avail himself of every means which The Law allowed him to
      maintain his elevation, though it might be by standing on the shoulders
      and necks of as good fellows as himself? What had Mr. Boland done but what
      others had been doing for ages, and were doing still? As for the matter of
      tithes, sure they should be paid to the minister who they never saw nor
      cared to see, and if Mr. Boland had profit on them, so much the better,
      because the less tithe that went into the absent minister's pocket the
      more would they all be pleased. To be sure the tithe-proctor always
      exacted to the last farthing, and more than the minister&mdash;and it is
      believed that Mr. Boland was not behind any of the trade&mdash;and some
      people say, indeed, that, from his knowledge of farming and the ins and
      outs of people's little tillage, he sometimes exacted to within a trifle
      of one-fifth of the produce. Indeed, in my own case&mdash;and I am but a
      poor brogue-maker, with half-a-dozen acres of the |poorest lands of F&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      he took from me, between citations to the Bishop's Court and other costs,
      with the original tithes, at least one-fourth of the entire produce of my
      little farm; nor do I know any one in the parish that fares better than
      myself, especially the poor people who don't understand the law, and who
      are not able, or willing, to get into it. However, I confess, I never
      regretted my own share of the loss, where I knew and thought that it all
      went to the glory and grandeur of the Masters and Misses Boland. Nor shall
      I ever forget the cutting-up which young Mick Boland gave me, with the
      butt-end of his loaded whip, the day I went to their house to complain
      that their driver had put all my sheep into the pound, for a debt of
      sixteen shillings, tithe-money. And now, my Lord Justice, as I have said
      so much of the truth in favor of Mr. Boland and his family, I hope your
      lordship will pass a merciful and just sentence oh them, and that this
      just jury won't find these friends to us, to our religion, and to our
      country, guilty."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a suppressed murmur of approbation, accompanied by an audible
      stamping of feet, at the conclusion of this merciful harangue. But silence
      being called, the jurors put their heads together across the table, and in
      less than two minutes their foreman handed up the issue-paper to the
      secretary, who sat by the side of the judge on receipt of which that
      functionary arose and in a solemn, scarcely audible voice, read from the
      paper a verdict of "guilty" against Michael Boland and his two sons. The
      judge then immediately arose from his chair, and in a low, solemn, but
      firm and distinct tone of voice, pronounced the verdict of the court to
      be, "Death and Dark Destruction to Michael Boland and his two sons," and
      that the sentence should be executed that very night. On the announcement
      of the verdict a low shriek of exultation arose from the audience,
      followed by a simultaneous half-suppressed cry of, "Long life to our
      Judge! Long life to Buck English!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge stood up again and said: "Now, boys, I know that there is no man
      here present but a man who has been often well tried in exploits of danger
      and of death: every man of you is the leader of a party of brave fellows,
      who, with yourselves, have sworn to sustain the oppressed; crush the
      tyrant, and right the wronged. Your men are brave, bold, and hearty; keep
      them to: their duty, and in perfect submission to your orders. Let the old
      tyrant and his young cubs be cut off, at all hazards, but spare the women&mdash;nay,
      make every possible exertion to save them, but, more especially, and by
      all means, let the eldest daughter, Miss Anna, be saved, secured, and
      brought to me, as you all know how long I have vainly endeavored to make
      her mine. And now, boys, every man to his post, and I, your commander,
      shall lead you on."
    </p>
    <p>
      Buck English is a real character&mdash;his real name was Ryan, and he had
      been respectably reared, but gave himself up to the intoxicating
      excitement of the French Revolution&mdash;he also fought in '98, and
      subsequently, for his intelligence and daring spirit, became the leader of
      all the lawless and disaffected parties in his native County of Limerick,
      and, indeed, of all Munster.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parties within the old ruin now made their appearance on the hill, and
      every man of them going to the head of his own body, they marched first to
      Hospital, a contiguous village, where they boldly beat a drum, the sound
      of which called up, as by enchantment, such a concourse of armed men as
      frightened the parties themselves. They marched from that, westwards, to
      Knockany, where they dug up several extensive fields (of grass) belonging
      to Mr. O'Grady. They marched on then, in the same direction, towards the
      residence of the Bolands, their numbers increasing as they went along, by
      voluntary and involuntary parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bolands, ever on the watch, soon learned that they were to be visited
      that night by those parties whom they had so long defied, but they never
      calculated that they Should be attacked by such a strong force as they now
      learned was approaching them&mdash;for it is believed that the actual
      number could not have been less than five thousand men, contributed by the
      Counties of Limerick Clare, Kerry, Cork, Waterford, Tipperary, and
      Kilkenny.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, they were not daunted, but immediately put themselves in order of
      battle. They first sent out (off their premises) all their servants, men
      and women, lest there should be a spy or a traitor among them. They then
      carried up all their arms and ammunition to the top floor of their
      (two-story, long, thatched) house. The father and the younger sons planted
      themselves at one of the window's facing the front. The elder son and the
      family tutor, a young man of the neighborhood, who would not abandon them
      in their hour of danger, took their stand at the window which looked
      directly at the narrow strong door of the wall which inclosed the house.
      The two daughters, with their mother, took up their places between the two
      windows, under cover of the wall, and having been well practiced for som,
      weeks previous, stood prepared to load and hand up the arms to their
      heroes when the occasion should arrive. About the hour of one o'clock in
      the morning, the barking of dogs, and an odd random shot, gave the Bolands
      certain and unmistakable notice that their hour of terror was at hand. And
      soon they could hear a monotonous sound of moving feet and suppressed
      voices, under the outer walls of their fortress. A horn was then sounded,
      and the besieged were called upon to open their gates and surrender at
      discretion. But no answer was received from within, where all was total
      darkness and apparent inactivity. Several attempts were now made to burst
      the strong yard door, but without effect. The assailants then began to
      fire at the thatch of the dwelling house, as well as on the out-offices,
      with the intent of setting them in flames; and after several attempts,
      they ultimately succeeded in igniting the thatch of a detached cow-house,
      which stood out from the other buildings, and the wind, unfortunately
      happening to blow from that quarter to the other offices, carried the fire
      to them, by which they were soon in a blaze. In the meantime, they
      procured two sledges from a neighboring forge, with which they assaulted
      the yard door, which they soon broke in. Now there was a dead pause on the
      part of the assailants&mdash;for they knew very well, that to pass on the
      threshold of this door was certain death. However, the pressure from the
      rear was so great, that suddenly several men were involuntarily pushed in
      through the doorway. And now the work of death commenced, for no sooner
      had the first batch been pressed in, than there was such a well-directed
      shower of bullets poured out on them from four well-charged blunderbusses,
      as levelled every man of them with the earth. A moment's pause ensued, and
      the door was again filled with new aspirants for "fame in the cannon's
      mouth," who, however, fared as badly as the preceding batch. During this
      time the assailing party had been busy with crowbars and other
      instruments, in making several breaches in the yard walls. At length they
      succeeded in opening entrances in three different places at the same time,
      and thus in a few minutes several hundred men were precipitated into the
      yard. And now commenced the work of death in earnest. The assailants were
      shot down in scores, while the upper windows of the house, from which the
      deadly firing was so ably kept up, received fifty discharges to the one
      that issued from them. The house was immediately surrounded, and guards of
      chosen faithful men were placed at its doors and lower windows, with
      strict orders to let no one, especially the "old fox," escape, with the
      exception only of the women.
    </p>
    <p>
      To add to the dreadful condition of the Bolands, the assailants had now
      succeeded in igniting the thatch of the dwelling-house, and it was
      immediately in a blaze. The Bolands and their tutor, ably served by their
      mother and sisters, still continued to deal death and destruction on the
      parties outside, without being yet fatigued or disabled. But at length the
      upper floor became too hot, and the old man, with his wife and daughters,
      retreated to the lower floor. The brothers and the tutor, however,
      remained above, but doing less execution, because, when the assailants saw
      the house on fire, they retreated outside the yard wall, excepting the
      guard who were placed round the house, and these stood so close to the
      walls that the party above had not power of injuring them, without fully
      exposing their own persons at the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      While both parties were thus in a fearful state of suspense, the burning
      roof of the house fell in on the three young men above, and immediately
      buried them for ever in its destructive flames. The assailing crowds set
      up a terrific shout of triumph. The floor above now began to crackle, and
      so dense was the smoke below, that the old man and the woman were in a
      state little short of suffocation. At last the Proctor became desperate,
      and opening one of the ground windows, and taking his poor wife by the
      hand, he attempted to throw himself and her out through it. No sooner,
      however, had they appeared at the window, than the old man was riddled
      with bullets from without, and thrown back into the now blazing room from
      which he had been endeavoring to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three young men and the old man being now destroyed, a voice in the
      rear of the crowd called out, in a fierce commanding them, to rescue the
      women at all hazards, whereupon the sledges were applied to the front door
      of the house; but while they were thus engaged, the young women unbarred
      the back door, and rushing out with their mother, uttering the most
      piercing shrieks, they ran into a stable which was near, before they could
      be laid hold of. Here, however, the two daughters were immediately seized
      on by order of the commander of the siege, Buck English, and carried out,
      but not violently, until they came to the stable-door, where the eldest
      daughter laid hold of the iron bolt staple of the door-post, and so
      desperately did she hold it, that she did not let it go till her shoulder
      was dislocated. They were both carried off then to the Galtee mountains,
      the usual resort of the Buck, who retained the eldest during pleasure. I
      forget what became of the younger girl, but the other became deranged, and
      in that melancholy state was subsequently taken into the "protection," as
      it is called, of a certain banker of Limerick, who shot himself in that
      city, to my own knowledge, in 1815. * * *
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene at the residence of the Bolands, on the morning after the
      attack, was truly horrifying. The remains of the four men, almost burned
      to cinders, were dug out of the still burning ruins, nor was the spectacle
      in the yard and on the neighboring road less frightful; from the multitude
      of dead bodies with which they were strewn; for most of their stranger
      assailants who were killed were left on the spot&mdash;the party not
      choosing to be seen carrying them off by daylight. But such of the people
      of the neighboring parishes as fell, were carried off by friends and
      acquaintances, and hid during that day, but buried at night at remote
      distances from their houses, in the newly-ploughed and in the wheat-sown
      fields. The inquest, &amp;c, being over, the government and the gentry of
      the county offered a large reward for any information that would lead to
      the apprehension or knowledge of the actors, especially the commander, in
      this fearful tragedy. A strong military force was stationed in the
      neighborhood, and all the bad and suspicious characters of the district
      were taken up, and committed to gaol on suspicion. However, the original
      concocters of the murder made their escape, either to England or to the
      remote parts of Clare, Kerry, and Cork; whilst terror reigned throughout
      the whole County of Limerick among the farmers at seeing the numbers that
      were arrested, and the largeness of the reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, as a well-known active magistrate of the county was sitting
      at his breakfast, a strange woman came to his door, and requested to see
      him on business of importance. He immediately called up two of his servant
      men, and ordered them to go to the door and see that the woman was really
      a woman, and that she had no arms about her. This was soon done, and the
      woman, a real one, was ushered into his worship's presence. She then told
      him&mdash;the room being first cleared of all other people&mdash;that, she
      was the wife of D&mdash;&mdash; A&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, the brogue-maker
      of F&mdash;&mdash;, that her husband was an honest, industrious man, who
      knew his own trade and business well, and who knew a great deal about the
      business of other people, too, and of what was going on in the country&mdash;that
      he was a man of upright and Christian principles, who would always feel it
      a conscientious duty to aid the laws of his country to preserve social
      order and punish crime&mdash;that he was not a man to be terrified or
      bribed by any amount of punishment or reward; but that if he were properly
      managed and kindly treated, he might be found able to give a good deal of
      useful information.
    </p>
    <p>
      His worship had the good-natured poor woman taken good care of for that
      day&mdash;and at a late hour of the same night he took and put her
      comfortably sitting on a horse, behind one of his constables, and,
      surrounded by a strong military body, horse and foot, marched her in
      safety; she showing the way to her own house. They found honest Darby
      sitting by his fire, reading his prayer-book, and in great grief at the
      unaccountable absence of his wife. He was dreadfully agitated when he
      found himself arrested, and strongly protested that he was an honest,
      industrious tradesman, who knew nothing of the wickedness of the world;
      and wondered much what this was all about.
    </p>
    <p>
      His worship advised him to be calm&mdash;that all should be well, but that
      he should accompany himself to his house. After Darby had spent several
      usefully employed days with his new friend, he was transmitted to Limerick
      gaol, with orders that he should be well treated, and be allowed to see
      his wife as often as she desired it. The wife soon found that it would be
      more convenient for her, and perhaps somewhat safer, to be living near her
      husband, and therefore went to reside in Limerick. The news of Darby's
      arrest caused no little alarm through the county, and it was soon
      whispered about that persons were now arrested, of whose participation in
      the Boland affair no human being could give any hint except himself alone.
      His wife's rooms became crowded every day with the wives, daughters, and
      sisters of the men arrested,&mdash;and others not arrested, or suspected
      by any living being; money in hundreds of pounds was poured into her lap
      to purchase the ignorance, the silence, or the perjury of Darby&mdash;and
      every one went away apparently satisfied with Darby's promises through his
      faithful wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assizes came down at last. Darby lost all recollection of any money
      but the large public reward, and on that occasion over twenty men were
      hanged chiefly on his evidence&mdash;though it was very difficult for the
      crown counsel to bring the poor reluctant man to the point; but when he
      did make a convicting admission, he took care that it should be a
      clincher, wrung from him, as he wished it to appear, by a cunning counsel.
      The gallows at Limerick continued for years after to be fed by Darby with
      victims for this crime; and several hundred were transported, or went into
      voluntary banishment on account of this fearful butchery. The writer of
      this knew well, and was at school with the secretary of the Court of
      Kilteely Hill.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.&mdash;The Chapel Green of Esker Dearg.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The chapel of <i>Esker Dearg</i>, or the Red Ridge, was situated in a rich
      and well-cultivated country, that for miles about it literally teemed with
      abundance. The Red Ridge under which it stood was one of those long
      eminences, almost, if not altogether, peculiar to Ireland. It was, as the
      name betokens, a prolonged elevation that ran for nearly a mile and a half
      in a north-eastern direction without appearing to yield to, or be
      influenced by, the natural position or undulations of the country through
      which it went. The epithet of red which was attached to it, originated,
      according to popular tradition, in a massacre which had taken place upon
      it during one of the Elizabethan wars, others imputed it to a cause much
      more obvious and natural, viz., its peculiar appearance during all seasons
      of the year, owing to the parched and barren nature of the soil, which, in
      consequence of its dry and elevated Position, was covered only with furze
      and tern, or thin, short grass that was parched by the sun into a kind of
      red-brown color.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under that end of this Esker which pointed nearest to the south-west,
      stood the chapel we have just mentioned. It was a rather long building
      with double gables and a double roof, perfectly plain, and with no other
      ornament, either inside or out, if we except a marble cross that stood
      against the wall upon the altar, of which the good priest was not a little
      vain, inasmuch as it had been of his own procuring. A public road of
      course ran past it, or rather skirted the green unenclosed space, by
      which, in common with most country edifices, it was surrounded. Another
      road joined that which we have mentioned, within a few perches of it, so
      that it stood at what might be nearly considered a cross-road. One or two
      large trees grew beside it, which gave to its otherwise simple appearance
      something of picturesque effect, especially during the summer months, when
      they were thickly covered with leaves, and waved and rustled in the sun to
      the refreshing breezes of that delightful season.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Sunday in the early part of March&mdash;we will not name the year&mdash;when
      our story commences. The Red Ridge Chapel was as usual surrounded by the
      greater portion of the congregation that had assembled to hear Mass.
      Within its walls there were only a few classes of youngsters, male and
      female, formed into circles, learning their catechism from the
      schoolmaster of the neighborhood, the clerk, or some devotee who possessed
      education enough to qualify himself for that kind office. Here and there
      in different parts of the chapel were small groups of adult persons, more
      religiously disposed than the rest, engaged in saying the rosary, whilst
      several others were performing solitary devotions, some stationary in a
      corner of the chapel, and others going the circuit around its walls in the
      performance of the Fourteen Stations of the Cross. Now, all these
      religious and devotional acts take place previous to the arrival of the
      priest, and are suspended the moment he commences Mass; into the more
      sublime majesty of which they appear, as it were, to lose themselves and
      be absorbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great body of the congregation, however, until the clergyman makes his
      appearance, are to be found outside, on what is called the Chapel Green.
      Here they stand in groups, engaged in discussing the topics of the day, or
      such local intelligence as may interest them; and it is to one of those
      groups that we now beg to call the attention of our readers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the larger of the two trees we have described stood a circle of the
      country people, listening to, and evidently amused by, the conversation of
      an individual whose bearing and appearance we must describe at great
      length.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a person whom at first sight you would feel disposed to class with
      young men. In other words, you might be led, from the lively flow of his
      spirits and his peculiarly buoyant manner, to infer that he had not gone
      beyond thirty or thirty-five. Upon a closer inspection, however, you could
      easily perceive that his countenance, despite of its healthy hue, was a
      good deal wrecked and weatherbeaten, and gave indications of those traces,
      which not only a much longer period of time, but deep and violent
      passions, seldom fail to leave behind them. His features were regular, and
      at first glance seemed handsome, but upon a nearer approach you were
      certain to find that their expression was heartless and disagreeable. They
      betokened no symptom of humanity of feeling, but were lit up with a spirit
      of harsh and reckless levity, which, whilst it made him popular with the
      unthinking multitude, might have been easily understood as the
      accompaniment, if not the direct exponent, of a bad and remorseless heart.
      The expression of his mouth was at the same time both hard and wanton, and
      his eyes, though full of a lively lustre, resembled in their brightness
      those of a serpent or hyena. His forehead was constructive but low, and,
      we may say, rather unintellectual than otherwise. He was without whiskers,
      a circumstance which caused a wound on the back part of his jaw to be
      visible, and one-half of the left-hand little finger had been shot off in
      defence of his church and country, according to his own account. This was
      a subject however, upon which he always affected a good deal of mystery
      when conversing with the people, or we should say, he took care to throw
      out such oracular insinuations of what he had suffered in their defence,
      as, according to their opinion, almost constituted him a martyr. In size
      he was somewhat above the middle height, compact, and exceedingly well
      built. His chest was deep and his shoulders powerful, whilst his limbs
      were full of muscular strength and great activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus given a portrait of his person, it only remains that we
      describe his costume as he appeared on the Sunday in question, and we do
      so because it may be right to inform our readers, in the outset, that one
      of his peculiarities was a habit of seldom appearing, for any lengthened
      period, in the same dress, or indeed in the same locality.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this occasion he had on a pair of tight buckskin breeches, top-boots
      and spurs&mdash;for he mostly went on horseback&mdash;a blue body-coat,
      with bright gilt buttons, a buff cassimere waistcoat, and a very
      fashionable hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cravat he wore was of green silk, and was tied in a knot, which might
      be understood by the initiated as one that entitled him to their
      confidence and respect. Our readers may not be surprised at this, for,
      unfortunately so high and bitter have party prejudices and feelings in our
      disturbed country run, that the very dress has been often forced to become
      symbolic of their spirit and existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chapel green, as we have said, was covered by the great bulk of the
      peasantry who were waiting the arrival of the priest. Here was a circle in
      which stood some rustic politician, who, having had an opportunity of
      getting a glimpse at some newspaper of the day, was retailing its contents
      to a greedy circle of listeners about him. There again stood some
      well-known storyteller, or perhaps a live old senachie, reciting wild and
      stirring legends to his particular circle. Some were stretched indolently
      on the grass, or lying about the ditches in the adjoining fields, but by
      far the greatest and most anxious crowd was assembled under the tree
      against which Buck English&mdash;for by this name was he known&mdash;leaned.
      We should say here, however, that he was not called Buck English, because
      his name was English, but in consequence of his attempts at pronouncing
      the English tongue in such a manner as he himself considered peculiarly
      elegant and fashionable. The man's education was very limited, indeed he
      had scarcely received any, but he was gifted at the same time with a low
      vulgar fluency of language which he looked upon as a great intellectual
      gift, and which, in his opinion, wanted nothing but "tip-top
      prononsensation," as he termed it, to make it high-flown and gentlemanly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our friend "the Buck," as he was universally called, was no sooner
      perceived in his usual station under the tree than there was a rapid
      gathering of the assembled crowd to hear him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, Paddy! what's the matther? where are you goin' to in sich a hell
      of a hurry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blood alive! man, sure Buck English is at his post to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How at his post?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why under the three where he always is when he comes here af a Sunday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hut! sure I know that; come, begad, let us hear him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith, it's he that's up to the outs and ins of everything. Sure the
      Counsellor himself made mintion of him in a great speech some time ago. It
      seems the Buck sent him up five pounds in a letther, and the Counsellor
      read the letther, and said it came from a most respectable gentleman, a
      friend of his, one Barney&mdash;no, not Barney&mdash;it wasn't Barney he
      called him, but&mdash;but&mdash;let me see&mdash;ay, begad&mdash;Bir&mdash;Birnard&mdash;ay,
      one Birnard English, Esquire, from the Barony of Treena Heela; bekaise, as
      the Buck doesn't keep himself very closely to any particular place of
      livin', he dated his letther, I suppose, from the Barony at large."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At any rate one thing's clear, that he's high up wid the Counsellor, an'
      if he wasn't one man in ten thousand he wouldn't be that."
    </p>
    <p>
      They had now reached the tree, and found that, short as the time was, a
      considerable crowd had already assembled about him, so that they were
      obliged to stand pretty far out in the circle. One or two young men, sons
      of most respectable farmers&mdash;for it somehow happened that the Buck
      was no great favorite with the seniors&mdash;stood, or rather had the
      honor of standing, within the circle, for the purpose of "houldin'
      conversation wid him;" for it could not reasonably be supposed that the
      Buck could throw away such valuable political information and high-flown
      English upon mere boors, who were incapable of understanding either the
      one or the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so, Mr. English," said one of those whom, he had brought within the
      circle, "you think the established church, the great heresy of Luther,&mdash;will
      go down at last?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think it, Tom&mdash;why, if you get me a book I'll swear it, and that's
      better than thinking any dee. Didn't Emencipation pess? answer me that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Begad it did so, sir,"&mdash;from the crowd. "Well," proceeded the Buck,
      "what doubt or hesiteetion can there be that the seem power and authority
      that riz our own church won't be keepable of puttin' down the great
      protesting heresy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "See that now," from the crowd; "begad it stands to raison sure enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," he proceeded, "none what-somever; but then the question is,
      how can it be effectualized?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd&mdash;"Begad, and so it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my friends, it isn't at oll difficult to determine that
      particularity: you oll know that a men lives by food&mdash;very well;
      pleece that men in a persition where he can't procur food and the nethrel
      kensiquence is that he must die. Eh&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&mdash;do you
      kimprehind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a doubt of it," replied Mr. Crowd, "but sure, at any rate, we will
      kimprehend it by-an'-by."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; take the protesting? church or the parsons, for it is oll the
      seem&mdash;deprive them of the mains of support, that is to see, deny them
      their tithes&mdash;don't pay a shilling&mdash;hold out to the death, as my
      friend the Counsellor&mdash;great O'Connell says&mdash;and as we oil say,
      practice passive resistance,then you know the establishment must stirve
      and die of femine and distitootion, as a contributive jidgment for its
      sins."
    </p>
    <p>
      Crowd&mdash;"Blood alive, isn't that great!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" from the other circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, that the parsons, an' all belonging to them, is to die of family
      prostitution for their sins!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Devil's cure to them, then, for they desarve it&mdash;at least many of
      them does, anyhow," says one segment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith, an' I don't know that either," says another segment. "The parsons,
      bad as they're spoken of, was, for the most part, willin' to live among
      us; and, begad, you all know that they're kind friends and good neighbors,
      an' that the money they get out of the parish comes back into the parish
      agin&mdash;not all as one as absentee landlords. They give employment as
      far as they're able, an' thar's no doubt but their wives and daughters
      does a great dale of good among the poor, and so, begad, does the parsons
      themselves often."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is that wiseecre that spoke last?" asked the Buck; "if I don't
      misteek he leebors with Dennis Purcel, the procter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, an' a very good masther he is," replied the spokesman of the segment;
      "gives plenty of employment anyhow&mdash;although the pay's no great
      shakes&mdash;an' that's more than some that abuses him does."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's no one aboosin' him here, my good friend, so don't imegine it&mdash;at
      leest I should be extremely sorry to do so. I respect himself and his
      family in a very elevated manner, I assoore you. An' what's more, my
      friend, I'll thank you to report to him that I said so."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he looked significantly among the mob, especially as he perceived
      that the man's eyes were not fixed upon him whilst he spoke, and having
      thrust his tongue into his cheek, half in derision, and half as it were by
      a natural action, he succeeded at all events in creating a general laugh;
      but so easily is a laugh, among such an audience, created, that it is not
      altogether within our power or penetration to determine the point which
      occasioned their mirth, unless it were the grimace with which his words
      were accompanied&mdash;or stay&mdash;perhaps it was the strong evil odor
      in which Purcel, the subject of their conversation, must have been held.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Talk of the devil, Mr. English," replied a stern voice from the
      listeners, "and he will appear; look down the road there and you'll see
      Purcel himself an' his family drivin' to mass on the sweat and groans of
      the people!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not all of them," replied another voice, in a different tone; "there's
      only himself, his wife, and their two spankin' daughters, upon the
      jauntin' car; but, blood alive, look at the sons! Devil so purty a lot of
      sweat and groans I seen this twelvemonth as the two is riding on, in the
      shape of a pair of blood-horses, so that you may put the blood, Barney,
      along wid the sweat and the groans, agra. Well done, tithes!&mdash;ha! ha!
      ha!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The individual laugh that accompanied these last observation was cruel,
      revolting, and hideous. The Buck sought out the speaker among the crowd,
      and gave him first a nod of approval&mdash;and almost instantly afterward
      added, with a quick change of countenance, but not until he perceived that
      this double expression was pretty generally understood&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't, my friend&mdash;if they get wealthy and proud upon our groans and
      tears an' blood, as you say, it is not their invalidity that makes them do
      so, but ours. Instead, of being cruel to them it is to ourselves we are
      cruel; for by peeing the aforeseed tithes we are peeing away our heart's
      blood, an' you know that if we are the fools to pee that way, small bleeme
      to them if they take it in the shape of good passable cash. They&mdash;meening
      sich men as Purcel&mdash;are only the instruments with which the parsons
      work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay," replied the stern voice, "but, in case we had the country to
      ourselves, do you think now, Buck darlin', that when we'd settle off the
      jidges, an' lawyers, an' sheriffs, an' bailiffs, that we'd allow the jails
      or the gibbets to stan', or the hangmen to live. No, by japers, we'd make
      a clane sweep of it; and when sich a man as Purcel becomes a tool in the
      parsons' hands to grind the people, I don't see that we ought to make fish
      of one an' flesh of the other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Darby Hourigan, is that you?" exclaimed the Buck; "well, although I
      don't exaggerate with your severity, yet I will shake hands with you. How
      do you do Darby? Darby, I think you're a true petriot&mdash;but, so far as
      Mr. Purcel is concirned, I wish you to understand that he is a particular
      friend of mine, and so is every mimber of his family."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith, an' Mr. Buck, it's more than you are with them, I can tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But perhaps you are a little misteeken there, Mr. Hourigan," replied the
      Buck, with a swagger, whilst he raised his head and pulled up the collar
      of his shirt at both sides, with a great deal of significant
      self-consequence;&mdash;"perhaps you are&mdash;I see so, that's oll.
      Perhaps, I repeat, there is some mimber of that family not presupposed
      against me, Mr. Hourigan?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, may be so," replied the other; "but if it be so, it's of late it
      must have happened, that's what I say."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hourigan, who was by trade a shoemaker, was also a small farmer; but,
      sooth to say, a more treacherous or ferocious-looking ruffian you could
      not possibly meet with in a province. He was spare and big-boned slouchy
      and stealthy in his gait, pale in face with dark, heavy brows that seemed
      to have been kept from falling into his deep and down-looking eyes only by
      an effort. His cheekbones stood out very prominently, whilst his thin,
      pallid cheeks fell away so rapidly as to give him something the appearance
      of the resuscitated skeleton of a murderer, for never in the same face
      were the kindred spirits of murder and cowardice so hideously blended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much more dialogue of the description just detailed took place, in which
      the proctor was not without defenders; but at the same time, as we are
      bound to record nothing but truth, we are compelled to say, that the
      majority of the voices were fearfully against him. If, however, he, the
      proctor and the instrument, had but few to support him, what must we not
      suppose the defence of the system in all its bearings to have been?
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, as Purcel and his family approached, the conversation was
      transferred from the political to the personal, and he, his wife, and his
      children, received at the hands of the people that satirical abuse,
      equally unjust and ungenerous, which an industrious family, who have
      raised themselves from poverty to independence, are in general certain to
      receive from all those who are deficient in the virtues by which the
      others rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, there he comes now, ridin' on his jauntin' car, an' does he think
      that we all forget the time when he went wid his basket undher his arm,
      wid his half-a-crown's worth of beggarly hardware in it. He begun it as a
      brat of a boy, an' was called nothin' then but <i>Mahon na gair</i> (that
      is 'Mat of the-grin'); but, by-and-by, when he came to have a pack over
      the shoulder, and to carry a yard wan' he began to turn Bodagh on our
      hands. Felix, it's himself that soon thought to set up for the style an'
      state."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At any rate," said the friendly voice aforesaid, "no one can deny but
      he's a good employer&mdash;if he'd give better wages."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A good employer!" said Hourigan; "we all know he must get his work done&mdash;small
      thanks to him for that, an' a small price he-pays for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We all know the ould proverb," said another individual; "set a beggar on
      horseback, an' he'll ride to the devil. Whist! here they come."
    </p>
    <p>
      As the last person concluded, Purcel and the female portion of his family
      drew up under the shadow of the tree already alluded to, which here
      overhung the road, so that he came right in contact with the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, boys," said he, with his characteristic good-humor, "how are you all?
      Darby Hourigan, how are your family? Isn't this glorious weather, boys?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blessed weather, sir," replied Hourigan, who became in some degree
      spokesman. "I hope your honor an' the mistress, sir, an' the young ladies
      is all well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My honor, as you are pleased to call me, was never better in my life; as
      for the mistress and the young ladies there they are, so judge for
      yourself, Darby: but Darby my good friend, you have a d&mdash;d sneaking,
      slavish way with you. Why do you call me 'your honor' when you know&mdash;for
      I've often told you&mdash;that wouldn't bear it? Am I not one of
      yourselves? and don't most of you know that I began the world upon
      half-a-crown, and once carried a hardware basket on my arm?&mdash;d&mdash;n
      it, then, speak like a man to a man, and not like a slave, as I'm half
      inclined to think you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Throth, sir," replied Hourigan, with an indescribable laugh, "an' for all
      that you say, there's many that gets the title of 'your honor,' that
      doesn't desarve it <i>as well</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah well, man! Why, there's many a man gets it that doesn't desarve it <i>at
      all</i>, which is saying more than you said&mdash;ha! ha! ha!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst this little dialogue took place, our worthy Buck had abandoned his
      place under the ikee, and flown to the car to assist the ladies off&mdash;a
      piece of attention not unobserved by Purcel, who obliquely kept his eye
      upon that worthy's gallantry, and the reception it was getting from the
      parties to whom it was offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leedies," said the Buck, in his politest manner and language, "will you
      allow me the gallantry to help you off? Mrs. Purcel, I hope you're well.
      Here, ma'am, aveel yourself of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Mr. English; I'm much obliged," she returned, rather coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leedies," he proceeded, flying to the other side, "allow me the
      gallantry."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two young women, who were full of spirits and good humor, were
      laughing most heartily, <i>sub silentio</i>, at the attention thus so
      ceremoniously paid to their mother by a man whom, beyond all human beings,
      she detested. Now, however, that he came to proffer his "gallantry" to
      themselves, they were certainly rather hard pressed to maintain or rather
      regain their gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leedies," the Buck continued, "may I have the gallantry to help you off?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, thank you, it's too much trouble, Mr. English."
    </p>
    <p>
      "None on airth, Miss Purcel&mdash;do let me have the high-flown
      satisfaction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well," she replied, "since you will be so polite," and giving him her
      hand she was about to go down, when suddenly withdrawing it, as if
      recollecting herself, she said, nodding with comic significance toward her
      sister Julia&mdash;"My sister, Mr. English, have you no gallantry for
      her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," he whispered, at the same time gratefully squeezing her hand,
      "you're a first-rate divinity&mdash;a tip-top goddess&mdash;divil a thing
      else. Miss Joolia, may I presoome for to have the plisure and polite
      gallantry to help you off the car; 'pon honor it'll be quite grateful and
      prejudicial to my feelings&mdash;it will, I assoore you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless me, whose is that wedding party, Mr. English?" asked Miss Julia,
      pointing to the opposite direction of the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      English instantly turned round to observe, when, by a simultaneous act,
      both sisters stepped nimbly from the car. Miss Julia, as if offended, but
      at the same time with a comic gravity of expression, exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, fie! Mr. English, is that your boasted gallantry? I'm afraid your
      eight years' residence in England, however it may have improved the
      elegance of your language and accent, hasn't much improved your
      politeness!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she and her sister tripped off to the chapel, which they
      immediately entered. Much about the same time their brothers arrived,
      mounted, certainly, upon a pair of magnificent hunters, and having handed
      them over to two lads to be walked about until the conclusion of Mass,
      they also entered the chapel, for the priest was not now more than three
      or four hundred yards; distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jest practised so successfully upon our friend the Buck occasioned a
      general laugh at his expense, a circumstance which filled, him with
      serious mortification, if not with actual resentment, for it so happened,
      that one of his great foibles was such a morbid sensibility to ridicule as
      was absolutely ludicrous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bedad, Mr. English, you wor fairly done there; in spite o' the tall
      English, you're no match for the ladies. Miss Julia fairly gev' you the
      bag to hould."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Buck's eye glittered with bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Julia, do you say?" he replied; "why, my good friend, the girl was
      christened Judy&mdash;plain Judy; but now that they've got into high-flown
      life, you persave, nothing will sarve them but to ape their betthers.
      However, never mind, I'll see the day yet, and that before long, when
      saucy Judy won't refuse my assistance. Time about's fair play, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be observed here, that Buck English happened to forget himself,
      which he almost always did whenever he became in earnest: he also forgot
      his polite language and peculiar elegance of pronunciation. To a vain and
      weak mind there is nothing more cutting than the consciousness of looking
      mortified in the eyes of others, and under these circumstances to feel
      that the laugh is against you, adds one not important item to "the
      miseries of human life."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Buck, now that the priest was at the chapel door, walked, with a
      stride that very much resembled the mock-heroic, towards the place of
      worship; but, in the opinion of the shrewd spectators, his dignity was
      sadly tarnished by the humorous contempt implied in the practical jest
      that had been so adroitly played off at his expense.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.&mdash;The Proctor's Principles and His Family.
    </h2>
    <p>
      For a considerable time previous to the scene described in our last
      chapter, a principle of general resistance to tithes had been deepening in
      and spreading over the country. Indeed the opposition to them had, for at
      least half a century before, risen up in periodical ebullitions that were
      characterized by much outrage and cruelty. On this account, then, it was
      generally necessary that the residence of that unpopular functionary, the
      tithe-proctor, should be always one of considerable strength, in order the
      more successfully to resist such midnight attacks as hostile combination
      might make upon it. Purcel, as well as other proctors of his day, had from
      time to time received threatening notices, not only of a personal nature,
      but also of premeditated attacks upon his house. The man was, however, not
      only intrepid and resolute, but cautious and prudent; and whilst he did
      not suffer himself to be intimidated by threats that for the most part
      ended in nothing, he took care to keep himself and his family well
      provided against any attack that might be made upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of Matthew Purcel is soon told. It is that of enterprise,
      perseverance, and industry, tinged a good deal by a sharp insight into
      business, a worldly spirit, and although associated with a good deal of
      pride and display, an uncontrollable love of putting money together, not
      always under circumstances that were calculated to render him popular, nor
      which could, in point of feeling or humanity, be at all defended. He had
      commenced the world, as has been already intimated, in character of a
      hardware pedlar. From stage to stage of that circulating life he advanced
      until he was able to become a stationary shopkeeper in the town of C&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;m.
      The great predilection of his heart, however, was for farming, and in
      pursuance with his wishes on this subject, he took a large farm, and
      entered upon its management with considerable spirit and a good deal of
      skill. His success was beyond his expectations; and, as the spirit of
      agriculture continued to gain upon him, he gradually lost his relish for
      every other description of business. He consequently gave up his large
      shop in C&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;m, and went to reside upon his farm, with a
      capital of some thousands, which he owed to the industry of his previous
      life. Here he added farm to farm, until he found himself proprietor of
      nearly six hundred acres, with every prospect of adding largely to his
      independence and wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now that his capacity as a man peculiarly well acquainted with the
      value of land, and of agricultural produce in general, induced him to
      accept of offers in connection with the collection of tithe, which were a
      good deal in accordance with his ability and habits. In short, he became a
      tithe-proctor, and in the course of a few years rented tithes himself to a
      very large amount.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is the brief history of Matthew Purcel, at the period when he makes
      his appearance upon our humble stage; and it only remains that we add a
      few particulars with regard to his family. Out of eleven children only
      four survived&mdash;two sons and two daughters&mdash;all of whom were
      exceedingly well educated, the latter accomplished. Purcel's great object
      in life was more to establish a family than to secure the individual
      happiness of his children. This was his ambition&mdash;the spirit which
      prompted him, in his dealings with the people, to forget too frequently
      that the garb of justice may be often thrown over the form of rapacity,
      and that the authority of law is also, in too many instances, only another
      name for oppression.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be difficult, perhaps impossible, to find in their native
      province four such children as called him father. His two sons were, in
      symmetry of figure, strength, courage, manly beauty, and gentlemanly
      bearing, almost unrivalled. They possessed the manners of gentlemen,
      without any of that offensive coxcombry on the one side, or awkward
      affectation of ease on the other, which generally mark the upstart. In
      fact, although they understood their own worth, and measured their
      intellectual powers and acquirments successfully with those of rank and
      birth, they had sense enough to feel that it would have been ridiculous in
      them to affect by their conduct the prestige of either; and they
      consequently knew that both discrimination and delicacy were necessary in
      enabling them to assume and maintain that difficult bearing in society,
      which prevented them from encroaching on the one side or giving up their
      proper position on the other. So far so good. Their characters, however,
      were not without some deep shadows. Whilst we acknowledge that they were
      generous, resolute, liberal, and of courage, we must also admit that they
      were warm, thoughtless, and a good deal overbearing to many, but by no
      means to all, of the peasantry with whom they came in contact. From the
      ample scale on which their farming was conducted, and in consequence of
      the vast number of men they necessarily had occasion to employ, they could
      not but detect among them many instances both of falsehood, dishonesty,
      and ingratitude. These vices at their hands never received any favor. So
      far from that, those whom they detected in the commission of them, were
      instantly turned adrift, Very often after having received a sound
      horse-whipping. Much abuse also occurred between them and the country
      people with reference to land, and especially tithes, in which they gave
      back word for word, and too frequently met concealed or implied threats
      either by instant chastisement or open defiance; the result of all was, as
      the reader may perceive, that they had the worst and least scrupulous, and
      consequently, most dangerous class of persons in the country for their
      enemies. The name of the elder was John, and the younger Alick; and,
      soothe to say, two finer-looking, more spirited, or determined young
      fellows could not be found probably in the kingdom. The relative position,
      then, in which they and the people, or rather the worst class of them,
      stood to each other, and the bitter disparaging taunts and observations
      with which the proctor and his sons were treated, not only on the chapel
      green, but almost wherever they appeared, are now, we trust, intelligible
      to the reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the daughters, Mary and Julia, we have not so much to observe. They
      were both very beautiful; and, as we have already said, highly
      accomplished. Both, too, were above the middle height and sizes, and
      remarkable for the singular elegance and symmetry of their figures. Mary,
      the eldest, was a dark beauty, with a neck and bosom like snow, and hair
      black as the raven's wing; whilst Julia, on the contrary, was fair, and if
      possible, more exquisitely rounded than her sister. Her eyes, of a blue
      gray, were remarkable for an expression of peculiar depth and softness,
      whilst Mary's dark brown were full at once of a mellow and penetrating
      light. In other respects they resembled each other very much, both being
      about the same height and size, and altogether of a similar bearing and
      figure. Mary's complexion was evidently inherited from her mother, who
      was, at the opening of our narrative, a black-haired, handsome woman, with
      a good deal of determination about her mouth and brow, but with a
      singularly benevolent expression when she smiled. She, too, had received a
      good, plain education, and was one of those naturally well-mannered women
      who, whilst they are borne forward into greater respectability by the
      current of prosperity, can assume, without effort, the improved tone of
      better society to which they are raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were few women in her sphere of life, or indeed in any sphere of
      life, who dispensed more good to the poor and distressed than Mrs. Purcel;
      and in all her kindness and charities she was most cordially aided and
      supported by her admirable daughters. Within a wide circle around her
      dwelling, sickness and destitution, or unexpected calamity, were ever
      certain to be cheered by the benevolent hand of herself or her daughters.
      The latter, indeed, had latterly relieved her, in a great degree, if not
      altogether, of all her distant and outdoor charities, so that little now
      was left to her management but the claims of such poor as flocked for
      assistance to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mass having been concluded, and the benediction given in the chapel of Red
      Ridge, Mr. Purcel and his family soon appeared among the crowd on the
      green, preparing to return home. The car was driven up opposite the chapel
      door, to the place where they were in the habit of waiting for it. The two
      brothers came out along with their sisters, and signed to the lads who had
      been holding their horses to bring them up. In the meantime, Buck English,
      unabashed by the rebuff he had received, once more approached, and just as
      the car had come up, tendered his gallantry&mdash;as he called it&mdash;with
      his usual politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I trust, leedies, that as you were not kin-descending enough to let me
      have the gallantry of helping you off, you will let me have the pleasure
      of helping you on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That lady behind you appears to have prior claims upon you, Mr. English."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Behind me!" he exclaimed, turning about. "Why, Miss Joolia, there's no
      leddy behind me."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime she beckoned to her brother who, while the, proctor was
      assisting his wife to take her seat, helped up both the girls, who nodding
      to the Buck, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Mr. English: we feel much obliged for your gallant intentions;
      quite as much, indeed, as if you had carried them into effect."
    </p>
    <p>
      This joke, so soon played off after that which had preceded it, and upon
      the same person, too, occasioned another very general laugh at the Buck's
      expense; and, beyond a doubt, filled him with a double measure of
      mortification and resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There you go," he muttered, "and it was well said before Mass, that if
      you set a beggar on horseback he'll ride to the divil."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To whom do you apply that language?" asked Alick Purcel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To one Michael Purcel, a tithe-proctor, an oppressor and a grinder of the
      poor," returned Buck, fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, you insolent scoundrel, how dare you use such language to my
      father?" said the other. "I tell you, that if it were not from a
      reluctance to create an unbecoming quarrel so near the house of God, and
      so soon after his worship, I would horsewhip you, you illiterate, vulgar
      rascal, where you stand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would be glad to catch you making the attempt," replied the Buck, with
      a look of fury; "because I would give you such a lesson as you would never
      forget. I would let you know that it isn't your father's unfortunate
      tenants and day-laborers you have before you&mdash;and that you scourge
      like hounds in a kennel."
    </p>
    <p>
      Purcel was actually in the act of springing at him, whip in hand, when,
      fortunately, the priest interfered, and prevented a conflict which, from
      the strength and spirit by which the parties were animated, must have been
      a fearful one.

      "What is this?" said the worthy man; "in God's name, what does this
      scandalous conduct, in such a place, and on such an occasion, mean? Come
      between these madmen," he proceeded, addressing the crowd, which had now
      collected about them. "Keep them asunder!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men were separated; but as each felt himself under the influence
      of strong resentment, they glared at one another with looks of fiery
      indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had better keep out of my way, you impudent scoundrel," said Purcel,
      shaking his whip at him; "and hark ye, make no more attempts to pay
      attention to any of my sisters, or, by the heavens above me, I will trace
      you through all your haunts, and flog you as I would a dog."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll take care to give you the opportunity before long, Squire Purcel, or
      rather Squireen Purcel," replied the Buck; "and what is more, I'll see you
      and yours in my power yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're too ready wid your whip, Mr. Purcel," said several voices from
      among the crowd; "and you do think it's dogs you have to dale wid, as Mr.
      English says."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Purcel, with scom; "I deny it; my whip is never raised unless
      to the shoulders of some slavish, lying, and dishonest scoundrel, whom I
      prefer to punish rather than to prosecute."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take. care it doesn't come aginst you, then, some o' these days," said a
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay," added another, "or some o' these nights!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you ungrateful and cowardly crew," he replied, "who have not one drop
      of manly blood in your veins, I despise you. Like all thorough cowards,
      you are equally slavish and treacherous. Kindness is thrown away upon you,
      generosity you cannot understand, for open fight or open resentment you
      have neither heart nor courage&mdash;but give you the hour of midnight,
      and your unsuspecting victim asleep&mdash;or place you behind the shelter
      of a hedge, where your cowardly person is safe and invisible, with a
      musket or blunderbuss in your hands, and a man before whom you have
      crawled in the morning like reptiles, you will not scruple to assassinate
      that night. Curse upon you! you are a disgrace to any Christian country,
      and I despise, I say, and defy you. As for you, Buck English, avoid my
      path, and cross neither me nor any member of my family."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alick Purcel," said English, "mark my words&mdash;I'll put my thumb upon
      you and yours yet. I say, mark them; for the day will come when you will
      remember them to your cost."
    </p>
    <p>
      Purcel gave him a stern look, and merely said&mdash;"I'm prepared for
      you;" after which he and his brother John mounted their horses and dashed
      off at a rapid pace towards their father's house, followed by the groans
      and hootings of the people&mdash;far above all whose voices was heard that
      of Buck English, in loud and contemptuous tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      On relating the occurrence at home, the father, as was his custom, only
      laughed at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh, Alick," said he, "what does it signify? Have we not been annoyed
      for years by these senseless broils and empty threats? Don't think of
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I, father!" replied his son; "do you imagine that I ever bestow a second
      thought upon them? Not I, I assure you. However, there is one thing would
      most unquestionably gratify me, and that is, an opportunity of cudgelling
      Buck English; because, upon second consideration, horse-whipping would be
      much too gentlemanly a style of chastisement for such a vulgar and
      affected ruffian."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I regret very much, however," said his sister Julia, "that I have been
      the cause of all this; but really, as Mary here knows, the absurdity of
      his language was perfectly irresistible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," replied her sister; "but, in fact, he is constantly annoying and
      persecuting her, and very few would bear such nonsense and absurdity from
      him with so much good-humor as Julia does. I grant that it is very
      difficult to be angry with so ridiculous a fool; but I do agree with
      Julia, that it is better to laugh at him, for two seasons: the first is,
      because he is a fit object for ridicule; and the second, because it is
      utterly impossible to resist it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think he will annoy Julia again, however," said Alick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not until the next opportunity," observed his brother, "when, you may
      take my word for it, he will be as ridiculously polite and impudent as
      ever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a doubt of it," said the father; "the rascal's incurable, and little
      did I imagine when I asked him once or twice to dine here that I was
      preparing such an infliction for poor Julia. Julia didn't he write to
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I certainly had the honor of receiving a very elaborate love-letter from
      him," replied Julia, laughing, "which I will show you some of these days;
      but, for my part, I think the fool is beneath resentment, and it is merely
      on that principle that I have treated him with good-humored contempt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is certainly as good as a farce," said the father; "and if the rascal
      had kept from making love, I should have still been glad to have him here
      from time to time to amuse us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How does he live at all?" asked Mrs. Purcel; "for, by all accounts, he
      has no fixed place of residence, nor any known means of support."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith, Nancy, that's a subject upon which we are all aiqually ignorant,"
      replied her husband; "but that the fellow lives, and can live comfortably&mdash;ay,
      and has plenty of money, there can be no earthly doubt. At the same time,
      that there is much talk about him, and a great deal of mystery too, is a
      sure case on the other hand. Well, never mind, Jack; I asked your old
      tutor, M'Carthy, to dine here to-day; he has come home to the country
      after having gained a scholarship, I believe they call it, in Trinity
      College."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad you did, father," replied John, "and I'm much obliged to you.
      Yes, he has gained first place, and I knew he would."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He intends going to the bar, he tells me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will be heard from yet, or I renounce all claims to common sense,"
      replied the other. "There is, unquestionably, a brilliant career before
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would rather, in the meantime," observed Mrs. Purcell, "that he had
      continued steadfast to his religion. They tell me that he has become a
      Protestant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I believe he couldn't gain a scholarship, as you call it, Jack,
      without becoming a member of the Established Church."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir, he could not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then," proceeded the proctor, "what great harm? Why, I believe in
      my soul, that if it weren't for the bigotry of priests and parsons, who
      contrive to set the two churches together by the ears, there would be
      found very little difference between them. For my part, I believe a good,
      honest Protestant will go to heaven when a scoundrel Papist won't, and
      vice versa. The truth is, begad, that it's six of one and half a dozen of
      the other; and sorry would I be to let so slight a change as passing from
      one religion to the other ever be a bar to the advancement or good fortune
      of any one of my children!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would much rather not hear you say so, Mat," replied his wife; "nor do
      I ever wish my children to gain either wealth or station in the world by
      the sacrifice of the highest principle that can bind the heart&mdash;that
      of religion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh, Nancy, you speak like a woman who never looked beyond the range of
      the kitchen and larder, or thought beyond the humdrum prayers of your
      Manual. I wish to see my children established; I wish to see them gain
      station in the world; I wish to make them the first of their family; and I
      do assure you, Nancy, that it is not such a trifle as the difference
      between popery on the one hand, and Protestantism on the other, that I'd
      suffer&mdash;that is, if they will be guided by me&mdash;to stand between
      them and the solid advantages of good connection, and a proper standing in
      the world. I say, then, boys and girls, don't be fools; for, as for my
      part, I scarcely think, to tell God's truth, that there's to the value of
      sixpence between the two creeds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father," said Mary, laughing, "you're a man of a truly liberal
      disposition in these matters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, papa," said Julia, with an arch look, "if there be not the value of
      sixpence between the two creeds, perhaps there is more than that between
      the two clergy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The proctor shook his head and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Judy, my girl, you have me there," he replied; "that goes home to the
      proctor, you baggage. Devil a thing, however, like an endowed church, and
      may God keep me and all my friends from the voluntary system!&mdash;ha!
      ha! ha! Come, now, for that same hit at the old proctor, you must walk
      over here and play me my old favorite, the 'Cannie Soogah,' just to pull
      down your pride. The 'Cannie Soogah,' you know, is the Irish for Jolly
      Pedlar, and a right jolly pedlar your worthy father was once in his days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the way, papa," said Mary, "talking of that&mdash;what has become of
      the pleasant man that goes under that name or nickname&mdash;the pedlar
      that calls here occasionally?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw him in the market yesterday," replied her father, "and a fine, hale
      fellow he is of his years. For a man of fifty he's a miracle of activity
      and energy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They say he is wealthy," observed John, "and I shouldn't wonder. You
      ought to give a good guess at that, father&mdash;ha! ha! ha!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right, John, I ought, and I think he is. You don't know how money gathers
      with a successful pedlar, who is up to his business. I am inclined to
      think that the Cannie Soogah is the only man who can throw any light on
      the history of Buck English."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who the devil is that impudent scoundrel, father? for it appears that, as
      regards his birth, family, and origin, nobody knows anything certain about
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that is just the position in which I stand," replied his father. "It
      is a subject on which he himself gives no satisfaction to any one. When
      asked about it, he laughs in jour face, and replies that he doesn't
      exactly know, but is of the opinion that he is the son of his father&mdash;whoever
      that was; but that, he says, he is not wise enough to know either, and
      then, after another laugh at you, he leaves you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How does he live?" asked John, "for he has no visible means of support&mdash;he
      neither works nor is engaged in any profession, and yet he dresses well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well! John;" exclaimed Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps I ought not to say&mdash;<i>well</i>, Julia; but at all events,
      he is very fond of being considered a buck, and he certainly dresses up to
      that character."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He admits that he was eight years in England," said his father;
      "although, for my part, it's just as likely that he spent seven years of
      that time in Botany Bay; if not, I should have no objection that something
      should occur to make him spend the remainder of his life there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should you wish the man so ill, papa'?" asked Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Mary&mdash;faith for a very good reason, my dear child; because I
      don't wish to see your sister annoyed and persecuted by the scoundrel. The
      fellow is so impudent that he will take no rebuff."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the way, father, where does M'Carthy stop, now that he is in the
      country?" asked Alick, with some hesitation, and a brow a little
      heightened in color.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the present," replied the other, "he stops with our friend,
      O'Driscol, the new magistrate. Faith, it's a shove-up for O'Driscol to get
      on the Bench. Halloo! there's M'Carthy's knock&mdash;I'm sure I know it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The proctor was right; but notwithstanding his quickness and sagacity,
      there was another individual in the room at that moment who recognized it
      sooner than he did. Julia arose, and withdrew under some pretence which we
      cannot now remember, but I really because she felt that had she remained
      until M'Carthy's entrance, her blushes would have betrayed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "M'Carthy is a very handsome young-fellow," observed John&mdash;"would he
      think of entering any pretensions to Katherine O'Driscol?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What d&mdash;d stuff you often talk, John&mdash;begging your pardon,"
      replied his brother; "he has hard reading, and his profession to think of&mdash;both
      of which he will find enough for him, setting Katherine O'Driscol and love
      out of the question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good, Alick," said John. "Ha! ha ha! I thought I would touch you
      there. The bait took, my boy; jealousy, jealousy, father."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alick, on finding that he was detected, forced himself into a confused
      laugh, and, in the meantime, M'Carthy entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could surpass the cordiality of his reception. A holiday spirit
      was obvious among the family&mdash;at least among all who were then
      visible. Secretly, however, did his eye glance about in search of one, on
      whose reception of him more depended than a thousand welcomes from all the
      rest. In about twenty minutes Julia made her appearance, but to any person
      in the secret, it was obvious that she was combating with much inward, if
      not with some appearance of external confusion and restraint. After the
      first greetings were over, however, she gradually recovered her
      self-possession, and was able to join in the conversation without
      embarrassment or difficulty.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.&mdash;Mountain Legislation, and its Executive of Blood.
    </h2>
    <p>
      After dinner that day, and while the gentlemen were yet at table, Mary and
      Julia, who, as we have said, had relieved their mother of those benevolent
      attentions which she had been in the habit of paying to the neighboring
      sick and poor, proceeded on their way to the cottage of a destitute woman
      in the next village, who was then lying in what was considered to be a
      hopeless state. The proctor himself, while he exacted with a heartless and
      rapacious hand the last penny due to him, was yet too good a tactician to
      discountenance these spontaneous effusions of benevolence on the part of
      his wife and daughters. With a good deal of ostentation, and that peculiar
      swagger for which many shrewd and hard-hearted men of the world are
      remarkable, he actually got the medicine himself for the helpless invalid
      in question, not forgetting at the same time to make the bystanders in the
      apothecary's shop acquainted with the extent of his own private charity
      and that of his family besides. The girls had proceeded a part of the way
      on their charitable errand, when it occurred to them that the medicine,
      which their father had procured on the preceding day, had been forgotten,
      and as the sick woman was to commence taking it at a certain hour that
      evening, it was necessary that either one or both should return for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You needn't come back, Julia," said Mary; "I will myself run home and
      fetch it. And accordingly her sister went back at a quick step towards her
      father's house. The spot where Julia stood to await the return, of her
      sister was within a few yards of a large white-thorn double ditch, on each
      side of which grew a close hedge of thorns, that could easily afford room
      for two or three men to walk abreast between them. Here she had not
      remained more than a minute or two, when, issuing from the cover of the
      thorns, and approaching her with something of a stage strut, our friend,
      Buck English, made his appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Joolia," he exclaimed, with what was intended for a polite bow, "I
      hope you will pardon me for this third liberty I teek in offering to spake
      to you. I see," he proceeded, observing her rising indignation, "that you
      are not inclined to hear me, but I kim here to give you a bit of advice as
      a friend&mdash;listen to my proposals, if you're wise&mdash;and don't make
      me the enemy of yourself or your family, for so sure as you reject me, so
      certainly will you bring ruin upon both yourself and them. I say this as a
      friend, and merk me, the day may come when you will oll remember my words
      too late."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a vehemence in his language, which could admit of no mistake as
      to the fixed determination of his purpose; his lips were compressed, his
      eyebrows severely knit, and his unfeeling, hyena eye scintillated with a
      fire that proceeded as much from an inclination to revenge as affection.
      Julia Purcel, however, though a women, possessed no whit of her sex's
      cowardice; on the contrary, her bosom heaved with indignant scorn, and her
      eye gave him back glance for glance, in a spirit that disdained to quail
      before his violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you dare to threaten me or my family, sir?" she replied; "I think you
      should know us better than to imagine that the threats of a ruffian, for
      such I now perceive you to be, could for a moment intimidate either them
      or me. Begone, sir, I despise and detest you&mdash;until this moment, I
      looked upon and treated you as a fool, but I now find you are a villain&mdash;begone,
      I say; I scorn and defy you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You defy me, do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I have said it, I defy you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, so be it," he replied, "you must take the consequences,
      that's all, and let your favorite, M'Carthy, look to himself too."
    </p>
    <p>
      Having uttered these significant words, ha reentered the double ditch,
      along which a common pathway went, and in a minute or two was out of
      sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary, on her return, at once perceived, by the flushed cheek and kindled
      eye of her sister, that something had discomposed her. "Why, goodness me,
      dear Julia, you look disturbed or frightened; what is the matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Disturbed I am," she replied, "but not at all frightened. This worthy
      lover of mine, whom nothing can abash, has honored me with another
      interview."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it after the scene between him and my brother to-day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," she replied, with a smile, for she now began once more to
      look upon the matter in a ludicrous point of view, "and has threatened not
      only myself, but the whole family with destruction, unless I favor his
      addresses&mdash;ha! ha! ha! He has one good quality in a lover, at all
      events&mdash;perseverance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say rather effrontery and impudence," replied Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I admit that," said her sister; "but at any rate, they very often go
      together, I believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      She then related the dialogue that took place, at which her sister, who
      was equally remarkable for courage, only laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fellow after all is only a fool," she observed. "If he were anything
      else, or if he had any serious intention of carrying such threats into
      effect, he most assuredly would not give expression to them, or put you on
      your guard against them. No, he is only a fool and not worth thinking
      about: let him go."
    </p>
    <p>
      They then proceeded to the cabin of poor Widow Cleary, to whom they
      administered the medicine with their own hands, and to whose children they
      brought their mother's orders to attend the house, that they might be
      relieved with that comfortable food which their destitute circumstances so
      much required.
    </p>
    <p>
      On their return home, the relation of the incident which we have just
      narrated very much amused the family, with the exception of M'Carthy, who
      expressed himself not quite at ease after having heard English's threats.
      "There is an extraordinary mystery about that man," he observed; "no one
      knows or can tell who he is; you can call him a fool, too, but take my
      word that there never hung mystery about a fool yet; I fear he will be
      found to be something much worse than a fool."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense," replied the proctor. "The fellow is only ridiculous and
      contemptible; he and his clipped English are not worth thinking of&mdash;let
      him go to the deuce."
    </p>
    <p>
      M'Carthy still shook his head, as if of opinion that they underrated the
      Buck's power of injuring them, but the truth was that neither Purcel nor
      his sons were at all capable of apprehending either fear or danger; they,
      therefore, very naturally looked upon the denunciations of English with a
      recklessness that was little less than foolhardy.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the last few years they had been accustomed to receive threats and
      written notices of vengeance, which had all ended in nothing, and, in
      consequence of this impunity, they had become so completely inured to them
      as to treat them only with laughter and scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been already intimated to the reader that M'Carthy was residing,
      during a short visit to the country, at the house of O'Driscol, the
      newly-made magistrate. It was pretty late that evening when he took leave
      of the Purcels, but as the distance was not far he felt no anxiety at all
      upon the subject of his journey. The night, however, was so pitchy dark,
      that even although well acquainted as he was with the road, he found some
      difficulty in avoiding the drains and ditches that enclosed it. At length
      he had arrived within a couple of hundred yards of O'Driscol's house, when
      as he was proceeding along suddenly found himself come unexpectedly
      against some individual, who was coming from an opposite direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hillo! who is here?" said the voice, in a kind of whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A friend," replied M'Carthy; "who are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's your name?" inquired the strange voice, "and be quick."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name is M'Carthy," replied our friend; "why do you ask?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come this way," said the stranger; "you are Francis M'Carthy, I think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that is my name&mdash;what is yours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That doesn't matther," replied the voice, "stand aside here, and be quiet
      as you value your life."
    </p>
    <p>
      M'Carthy thought at the moment that he heard the noise of many feet, as it
      were in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will not be safe," said the voice, "if you refuse to take my advice;"
      and as he spoke he partly forced M'Carthy over to the side of the road
      where they both stood invisible from the darkness of the night, as well as
      from the shelter of a large whitethorn branch, which would, even in
      daylight, almost have concealed them from view. In a few minutes, a large
      body of people passed them with that tread which always characterizes the
      motions of undisciplined men. There was scarcely a word among them, but
      M'Carthy felt that, knowing them as he did to be peasants, there was
      something dreadful in the silence which they maintained so strictly. He
      could not avoid associating their movements and designs with some act of
      violence and bloodshed, that was about to add horror to the impenetrable
      gloom of night, whose darkness, perhaps, they were about to light up with
      the roof-tree of some unsuspecting household, ignorant of the fiery fate
      that was then so near them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several hundreds must have passed, and when the last sounds of their tread
      had died away, M'Carthy and his companion left their hiding-place, when
      the latter addressed him as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Mr. M'Carthy, I wish you to understand that you are wid a friend&mdash;mark
      my words&mdash;avoid the man they call Buck English, for of all men livin'
      he hates you the most; and listen, whenever you come to this country don't
      stop in procthor Purcel's, otherwise you may draw down ruin and
      destruction upon him and his; and, if I'm not mistaken, you're the last
      man livin' who would wish to do that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the way," asked M'Carthy, "who is Buck English?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," replied the stranger, "nor do I know any one that does."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And may I not ask who you are yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;for I've good raisons for not telling you. Good-night, and mark
      my words&mdash;avoid that man, for I know he would give a good deal to sit
      over your coffin&mdash;and you in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      We shall now allow M'Carthy to proceed to his friend's house, which he
      reached without any further adventure, and ask the reader to accompany the
      stranger, who in a few minutes overtook the body we have described, to
      which he belonged. They proceeded in the same way, still maintaining a
      silence that was fearful and ominous, for about a mile and a half. Whilst
      proceeding, they met several persons on the road, every one of whom they
      stopped and interrogated as to his name and residence, after which they
      allowed them to pass on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do they! stop and examine the people they meet?" whispered one of
      them a young lad about nineteen&mdash;to him who had just warned McCarthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," said the other, "is it possible you don't know that? It's aisy seen
      you're but young in the business yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is my first night to be out," replied the youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then," rejoined our friend, "it's in the expectation of meetin' an
      enemy, especially some one that's <i>marked</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' what would they do if they did?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Do</i>? said the other; "<i>do for him!</i>. If they met sich a one,
      they'd take care his supper wouldn't cost him much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blood alive!" exclaimed the young fellow. "I'm afeard this is a bad
      business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith, an' if it is, it's only beginnin'," said the other, "but whether
      good or bad the counthry requires it, an' the Millstone must be got rid
      of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the Millstone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Protestant church. The man that won't join us to put it down, must be
      looked upon and treated as an enemy to his country&mdash;that is, if he is
      a Catholic."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no objection to that," replied the youth, "but I don't like to see
      lives taken or blood shed; murdher's awful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must set it down, then," replied the other, "that both will happen,
      ay, an' that you must yourself shed blood and take life when it come your
      turn. Howanever, that will soon come aisy to you; a little practice, and
      two or three opportunities of seeing the thing done, an' you'll begin to
      take delight in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you now?" asked the unsophisticated boy, with a quivering of the
      voice which proceeded from a shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, no," replied the other, still in a whisper, for in this tone the
      dialogue was necessarily continued; "not yet, at any rate; but if it came
      my turn to take a life I should either do it, or lose my own some fine
      night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my conscience," whispered the lad, "I can't help thinkin' that it's
      a bad business, and won't end well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, but the general opinion is, that if we get the Millstone from about
      our necks, a few lives taken on their side, and a few boys hanged on ours,
      won't make much difference one way or other, and then everything will end
      well. That's the way of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      This muffled dialogue, if we may use the expression, was now interrupted
      by a change in their route. At a Rath, which here capped an eminence of
      the road, a narrow bridle-way diverged to the right, and after a gradual
      ascent for about a mile and a half, was lost upon a rough upland, that
      might be almost termed a moor. Here they halted for a few minutes, in
      deliberation as to whether they should then proceed across the moor, or
      wait until the moon should rise and enable them to see their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was shortly resolved upon to advance, in order that they might lose as
      little time as possible, in consequence of having, as it appeared, two or
      three little affairs to execute in the course of the night. They
      immediately struck across the rough ground which lay before them, and as
      they did so, the conversation began to be indulged in more freely, in
      consequence of their remoteness from any human dwelling or the chances of
      being overheard. The whole body now fell into groups, each headed by a
      certain individual who acted as leader, but so varied were the topics of
      discourse, some using Irish, others the English language, that it was
      rather difficult to catch the general purport of what they said.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length when a distance of about two miles had been traversed, they came
      out upon one of those small green campaigns, or sloping meadows, that are
      occasionally to be found embosomed in the mountains, and upon which the
      eye rests with an agreeable sense of relief, on turning to them from the
      dark and monotonous hue of the gloomy wastes around them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not been many minutes here when the moon rose, and after a little
      time her light would have enabled a casual or accidental spectator to
      witness a fearful and startling scene. About six hundred men were there
      assembled; every man having his face blackened, and all with shirts over
      their outward and usual garments. As soon as the moon, after having gained
      a greater elevation in the sky, began to diffuse a clearer lustre on the
      earth, we may justly say that it would be difficult to witness so strange
      and appalling a spectacle. The white appearance of their persons, caused
      by the shirts which they wore in the manner we have stated, for this
      peculiar occasion, when contrasted with their blackened visages, gave them
      more the character of demons than of men, with whom indeed their strange
      costume and disfigured faces seemed to imitate the possession of very
      little in common, with the exception of shape alone. The light was not
      sufficiently strong to give them distinctness, and as a natural
      consequence, there was upon them a dim gleamy look&mdash;a spectral
      character that was frightful, and filled the mind with an impression that
      the meeting must have been one of supernatural beings, if not an
      assemblage of actual devils, in visible shape, coming to perpetrate on
      earth some deed of darkness and of horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the whole six hundred there might have been about one hundred
      muskets. Pistols, blunderbusses, and other arms there were in considerable
      numbers, but these were not available for a portion, at least, of the
      purposes which had brought them together.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some preliminary preparation a light was struck, a candle lit,
      around which a certain number stood, so as to expose it to as little
      chance of observation as possible. A man then above the middle size,
      compact and big-boned, took the candle in one hand, and brought it towards
      a long roll which he held in the other. He wore a white hat with a low
      crown, had large black whiskers which came to his chin, and ran besides
      round his neck underneath. The appearance of this man, and of those who
      surrounded the dim light which he held was, when taking their black
      unnatural faces into consideration, certainly calculated to excite no
      other sensations than those of terror mingled with disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," said he, in a strong rich brogue, "let every man fall into rank
      according as his name is called out; and along with his name he must also
      repate his number whatever it may be, up until we come to a hundred, for I
      believe we have no more muskets. Where is Sargin Lynch?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here I am," replied that individual, who enjoyed a sergeant's pension,
      having fought through the peninsular campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take the lists then and proceed," said the leader; "we have little time
      to lose."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lynch then called over a list until he had reached a hundred; every man,
      as he answered to his name, also repeated his number; as for instance,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom Halloran."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here&mdash;one!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peter Rafferty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here&mdash;two!" and so on, until the requisite number was completed, and
      every man as he responded fell also into rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus got them into line, he gave them a rather hasty drill; and
      this being over, hundred after hundred went through the same process of
      roll-call and manoeuvre, until the task of the night was completed,
      so-far, at least, as that particular duty was concerned. Other duties,
      however, in more complete keeping with their wild and demon-like
      appearance, were still to be performed. Short rolls were called, by which
      selections for the assemblage of such as had been previously marked down
      for the robbery of arms, were made with considerable promptitude. And,
      indeed, most of those to whom, such outrageous and criminal attacks wera
      assigned, seemed to feel flattered by being appointed to the performance
      of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, when these matters were, arranged, and completed, the whole
      body was ordered to fall into rank, and the large-man, who acted as
      leader, walked for a times up and down in front of them, after which, as
      nearly opposite their centre as possible, he deliberately knelt down, and
      held his two open palms across each other for some seconds, or perhaps for
      half a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      A low fearful murmur, which no language could describe, and no imagination
      conceive&mdash;without having heard it, ran along the whole line. Whether
      it proceeded from compassion or exultation, or a blending of both mingled
      with horror and aversion, or a diabolical, satisfaction, it is difficult
      or rather absolutely impossible to say. The probability is, however, that
      it was made up of all these feelings, and that it was their unnatural
      union, expressed under such wild and peculiar circumstances, that gave it
      the impressive and dreadful effect wo have described.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does he mane?" said some of the youthful and inexperienced portion
      of them, in the accustomed whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a death to take place to-night," replied an older member;
      "there's either a man or family doomed, God knows which!" He then arose,
      and going along the front: rank, selected by name twenty-four individuals,
      who were made to stand in order; to one of these he whispered the name and
      residence of the victim; this one immediately whispered the secret to the
      person next him, who communicated it in his turn, and thus it went round
      until the last had received it. This being accomplished, he stood apart
      from the appointed murderers, and made them all, one after another,
      whisper to him the name and residence as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," said the leader, "it's my duty to tell you that there's a man to be
      done for tonight; and you must all know his crime. He was warned by us no
      less than four times not to pay tithe, and not only that, but he refused
      to be sworn out to do so, and wounded one of the boys that wor sent by me
      one night to swear him. He has set us at defiance by publicly payin' his
      tithes to a man that we'll take care of some o' these nights. He's now
      doomed, an' was tried on the last night of our meetin'. This night he
      dies. Them that has his life in their hands knows who he is an' where
      they'll find him. Once and for all then this night he dies. Now, boys,
      such of you as have nothing to do go home, and such of you as have your
      work before you do it like men, and don't draw down destruction on
      yourselves by neglectin' it. You know your fate if you flinch.&mdash;I
      have done."
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who were not on duty, to use a military phrase, returned across the
      moors by the way they came, and consequently reached the bridle road we
      have spoken of, together. Such, however, as were set apart for the
      outrages and crimes of the night, remained behind, in order that the
      peculiar destination of their atrocities might be known only to the
      individuals who were appointed to perpetrate them.
    </p>
    <p>
      On their return, our unknown friend, who had rendered such an essential
      service to M'Carthy, thus addressed his companion&mdash;that is to say,
      the man who happened to be next him,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, neighbor, what do you think of this night's work?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, that everything's right, of coorse," replied the other; "any man
      that strives to keep the Millstone about our necks desarves his fate; at
      the same time," he added, dropping his voice still lower, "I'd as soon not
      be the man to do the deed, neighbor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I can't say," returned our friend, "but I'm a trifle of your way of
      thinkin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's one thing troubles me," added his companion, an' it's this&mdash;there
      was a young lad wid us to-night from my neighborhood, he was near the last
      of us as we went along the road on our way to the mountains; I seen him
      whisperin' to some one a good deal as we came out&mdash;now, I know
      there's not on airth a kinder-hearted or more affectionate boy than he is;
      he hasn't a heart to hurt a fly, and is loved and respected by every one
      in the neighborhood. Very well! God of glory! isn't it too bad, that this
      one, handsome, lovin', and affectionate boy, the only child of his father
      and mother,&mdash;<i>fareer gair</i> (* Bitter misfortune.)&mdash;my
      friend, whoever you are, isn't it too bad, that that boy, innocent and
      harmless as a child, will go home to his lovin' parents a murdherer this
      night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What makes you say so?" asked our unknown friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," replied the man, "he stood beside me in the ranks, and has been
      sent to murdher the man that was doomed."
    </p>
    <p>
      To this our friend judiciously avoided making any reply, the fact being
      that several individuals in high trust among these Whiteboys were
      occasionally employed to sound suspected persons, in order to test their
      sincerity. For about half a minute he spoke not; but at length he said,
      with something like sternness&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's no use in sich talk as this, my friend; every man that joins us
      must make up his mind to do his duty to God and his country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a quare way of sarvin' God to commit midnight murdher on his
      creatures," responded the man with energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know who you are," replied our friend, "but if you take my
      advice, you'll not hould such conversation wid every man you spake to in
      this body. Wid me you're safe, but at the same time, I say, don't draw
      suspicion on yourself, and it'll be betther for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is this man?" asked the other, who appeared to have been borne away a
      good deal by his feelings, "that commands us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you know Captain Midnight?" replied the other, somewhat evasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, of coorse I know the man by that name; but, at the same time, I know
      nothin' else about him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you never hear?" asked his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, to tell you the truth," said the other, "I heerd it said that he's
      the <i>Cannie Soogah</i>, or the Jolly Pedlar that goes about the
      country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said the other, lowering his voice a good deal in reply, "if I
      could trust you, I'd tell you what I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll give you my name, then," replied the other, "if you doubt me;" he
      accordingly whispered it to him, and the conversation proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know your family well," returned our friend; "but, as I said before, be
      more on your guard, unless you know well the man you spake to. As for
      myself, I sometimes think it is the <i>Cannie Soogah</i> and sometimes
      that it is not. Others say it's Buck English; but the Buck, for raisons
      that some people suspect, could never be got to join us. He wishes us
      well, he says, but won't do anything till there comes an open 'ruction,
      and then he'll join us, but not before. It's hard to say, at any rate, who
      commands us when we meet this way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why the dickens need you ax? Sure it's not the same man two nights
      runnin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I have been only three or four times out yet," replied his companion;
      "and, sure enough, you're very&mdash;right&mdash;they hadn't the same man
      twiste."
    </p>
    <p>
      They had now reached the road under the Fort or Rath we have alluded to,
      and as there was no further necessity for any combined motion among them,
      and as every man now was anxious to reach home as soon as possible, their
      numbers diminished rapidly, until they ultimately dispersed themselves in
      all directions throughout the country.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.&mdash;Mirth and Murder&mdash;A Tithe-Proctor's Office.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning, when our proctor and his family assembled at breakfast,
      their usual buoyancy of spirits was considerably checked by a report which
      had already spread over a great portion of the country, that a very
      industrious and honest farmer, who lived within about four miles of them,
      had been murdered in his own house the night before, by a party of fellows
      disguised with blackened faces, and who wore shirts over their clothes.
      The barbarous and brutal deed, in consequence of the amiable and excellent
      character of the man&mdash;who had been also remarkable for resolution and
      courage&mdash;had already excited an extraordinary commotion throughout
      the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Boys," said Purcel, "I have been in C&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;m this morning,
      and, I'm sorry to say, there's bad news abroad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is that, sir?" asked Alick,&mdash;"no violence, I hope; although I
      wouldn't feel surprised if there were; the country is getting into a bad
      state: I think myself the people are mad, absolutely mad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You both knew Matthew Murray," he proceeded, "that lived down at
      Rathkeerin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, father," said John; "what about him?&mdash;no harm, I hope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was murdered in his own house last night," replied his father; "but
      it's some consolation that one of the murdering villains is in custody."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is bad business, certainly," replied John; "in fact, it's dreadful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is dreadful," said the father; "but the truth is, we must have the
      country, at least this part of it, proclaimed, and martial law
      established;&mdash;damn the murdering scoundrels, nothing else is fit for
      them. We must carry arms, boys, in future; and by d&mdash;n, the first man
      I see looking at me suspiciously, especially from behind a hedge, I'll
      shoot him. As a tithe-proctor I could do so without much risk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not, father," said Alick, "until he should first offer, or make an
      attempt at violence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would not, in the present state of the country, wait for it," replied
      the determined and now indignant proctor; "if I saw him watch me with arms
      in his hands, or any dangerous weapon about his person, by d&mdash;n I'd
      put a bullet through him, with no more remorse than I would through a dog,
      and, if the animal were a good one, I think he would be the greater public
      loss of the two."
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at this moment, the females of the family, who had been giving
      breakfast to a number of poor destitute creatures, made their appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where have you all been?" asked Mrs. Purcel, addressing her husband and
      sons; "here have we been waiting breakfast for you during the last
      half-hour, and finding you were none of you within, we went and gave these
      poor creatures without something to eat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay," responded the angry proctor, "and it's not unlikely that the son, or
      husband, or brother of some of them may take a slap at me or at one of our
      sons, from behind a hedge, before these long nights pass off. D&mdash;n
      me, but it's throwing pearls before swine, to show them either kindness or
      charity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something has angered you, papa," said Mary; "I hope you have heard
      nothing unpleasant; I am not very timid, but when a whole country is in
      such a state of disturbance, one may entertain a reasonable apprehension,
      certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I am angry, Mary," replied her father; "there's as decent and quiet,
      but, at the same time, as spirited a man as there ever was in the barony,
      murdered this morning&mdash;Mat Murray of Rathkeerin; however, as I said,
      it's a great consolation that one of the murderers is in custody."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who is the wretch, papa?" asked Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One that nobody ever could have suspected for such an act," replied
      Purcel&mdash;"a son of one of our own tenants&mdash;honest Michael
      Devlin's son&mdash;James."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Utterly impossible, father," exclaimed Julia, "there must be a mistake;
      that quiet and dutiful boy&mdash;their only son&mdash;never could have
      been concerned in the crime of murder."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, perhaps not, Judy; but, you silly girl, you talk as if you were in
      love with him. Why, child, there is such a system abroad, now that a man
      can scarcely trust his own brother&mdash;no, nor does a father know, when
      he sits down to his breakfast in the morning with his own son, whether, as
      Scripture says, he is not dipping his hand in the dish with a murderer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mat," said his wife, "you ought not to be out late at night, nor the boys
      either. You know there is a strong feeling against you; and indeed I think
      you ought not, any of you, ever to go out without, arms about you&mdash;at
      all events, until the country gets quiet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I was just saying, Nancy," replied her husband;&mdash;"hallo! who's
      this coming up to the hall-door?&mdash;begad, our old pleasant friend, the
      <i>Cannie Soogah</i>. Upon my troth, I'm glad to see him. Hallo! <i>Cannie!&mdash;Cannie
      Soogah</i>, my hearty,&mdash;Jolly Pedlar, I say&mdash;this way! How are
      you, man?&mdash;have you breakfasted? Of course not. Well, go to the
      kitchen and, if you don't show good eating, it won't be for want of
      materials."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God save you, Misther Purcel," replied the pedlar, in a rich, round
      brogue; "God save you, young gintlemen. Oh, thin, Misther Purcel, by my
      sowl it's your four quarthers that has a right to be proud of your;
      family! And the ladies&mdash;not forgettin' the misthress herself&mdash;devil
      the likes of the same two young ladies I see on my whole bait, an' that's
      the country at large, barrin' the barony of Bedhehusth, where these cruel
      murdhers is committed; an' devil a foot I'll ever set into it till it's
      changed for the betther."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, be off," said the proctor, "to the kitchen; get your breakfast
      first, and then we'll chat to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will; but oh, Misther Purcel darlin', did you hear what happened last
      night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it Murray's business?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you call Murray's business, Misther Purcel? 'Tis Murray's
      murdher, you mane?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, I have heard it all this morning in C&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;m."
    </p>
    <p>
      The pedlar only shook his head, looked upwards, and raising his two hands
      so as to express amazement, exclaimed&mdash;"Well, well, what is the world
      goin' to! troth, I'll not ate half my breakwist in regard of it!" So
      saying he slung his huge pack upon his shoulder as if it had been a mere
      bag of feathers, and took his way round to the kitchen as he had been
      desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Connie Soogah</i>, for so the people universally termed him, was in
      person and figure a fine burly specimen of manhood. His hair was black, as
      were a pair of large whiskers, that covered the greater portion of his
      face, and nearly met at his chin. His arms and limbs were powerfully made,
      and what is not always the case in muscular men, they betokened great
      activity as well as unusual strength. Nobody, for instance, would look
      without astonishment at the ease with which he swung a pack, that was
      weighty enough to load an ass, over his shoulder, or the lightness and
      agility with which he trotted on under it from morning till night, and
      this during the very severest heat of summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      M'Carthy, on reaching O'Driscol's the night before, had come to the
      conclusion of not making any allusion whatsoever to the incident which had
      just occurred to him. O'Driscol, who was only a newly-fledged magistrate,
      would, he knew, have made it the ground-work of a fresh communication to
      government, or to his friend the Castle, as he called it, especially as he
      had many other circumstances of less importance since his elevation to the
      magistracy. One indeed would imagine that the peace and welfare of that
      portion of the country had been altogether left to his sole and individual
      management, and that nothing at all of any consequence could get on
      properly in it without his co-operation or interference in some way. For
      this reason, as well as for others, M'Carthy prudently hesitated either to
      arouse his loyalty or disturb the tranquility of his family, and after
      joining him in a tumbler of punch, or what O'Driscol termed his nightcap,
      he retired to bed, where, however, he could not for a considerable time
      prevent himself from ruminating, with a good deal of seriousness, upon the
      extraordinary interview he had had with the friendly stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast the next morning he resolved, however, to communicate to
      his friends, the Purcels, who were at all events no alarmists, and would
      not be apt to make him, whether he would or not, the instrument of a
      selfish communication with the government, a kind of honor for which the
      quiet and unassuming student had no relish whatsoever. He sauntered
      towards the proctor's, at whose house he arrived a few minutes before the
      return from the kitchen of our friend the Connie Soogah, who had been
      treated there with an excellent and abundant breakfast, to which, in spite
      of the murder of Murray, he did ample justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Mr. Purcel," he exclaimed, tossing down his pack as if it had been a
      schoolboy's satchel, "by the lomenty-tarry you have made a new man of me!
      Whoo!" he proceeded, cutting a caper more than a yard high, "show me the
      man now, that would dar to say bow to your&mdash;beg pardon, ladies, I
      must be jinteel for your sakes&mdash;that would dar, I say, to look
      crucked at you or one a' your family, and maybe the Cannie Soogah wouldn't
      rise the lap of his liver. Come, young ladies, shall I make my display? I
      know you'll buy lot o' things and plenty besides; I can praise my goods,
      thank God, for you see, Miss Mary, when the world comes to an end it'll be
      found that the man who couldn't say three words for himself, and one for
      his friend, must be sent down stairs to keep the fire in. Miss Julia, I
      have a shawl here that 'ud make you look worse than you do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Worse, Cannie!" replied Julia, "do you call that a recommendation?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, Miss Julia, you look so well that nothing on airth could make
      you look batther, and by way of variety, I've gone to the Well o' the
      world's end to get something to make you look worse. God knows whether
      I've succeeded or not, but at all events, we'll thry."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he produced a very handsome shawl, together with a rather large
      assortment of jewelry and other matters connected with the female toilet,
      of considerable taste and expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here," he added, "are some cotton and silk stockins'&mdash;but upon my
      profits, it's not to every foot an' leg I'd produce them. I'm a great
      coortier, ladies, you must know, and am in love wid every purty girl I
      meet&mdash;but sure that's only natural; however, as I was sayin', it's
      not to a clype or a pair of smooth-in' irons I'll produce such stockins'
      as these! No, no, but a purty foot an' leg is always sure to get the worth
      o' their money from the Cannie Soogah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well done, Cannie!" said the proctor, "dix me, but you're a pleasant
      fellow&mdash;come girls, you must buy something&mdash;handsel him. You got
      no handsel to-day, Cannie?" he added, winking at the pedlar to say no.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Barrin' the first foundation in the kitchen within," he replied; "for you
      must know that's what I call my breakfast, handsel of any kind didn't
      cross my palm this day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, the girls must certainly buy something," added Purcel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But we've no money, papa."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," replied the pedlar, "you have what's betther&mdash;good credit with
      the Cannie Soogah&mdash;och, upon my profits I'd rather have one sweet
      coaxin' smile from that purty little mouth of yours, Miss Julia, than
      money in hand any day! Ah! Misther Purcel, darlin', isn't it a poor thing
      not to have an estate of ten thousand a year?" and here he looked
      wistfully at the smiling Julia, and shrugged his shoulders like a man who
      knew he was never likely to gain his wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would buy something," said Mary, "but, like Julia, I am penniless."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never say so, Miss Mary, to me; only name what you'd like&mdash;lave the
      price to my honesty, and the payment to my patience, and upon my profits
      you won't complain, I'll go bail."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," observed Julia, "or what if papa would treat us to something? Come,
      papa, for the sake of old times; let us see whether you have forgotten any
      of your former, craft."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good, Judy! ha! ha! ha!&mdash;well done! but Cannie, have you nothing for
      the gentlemen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, we must pause for a little to state, that the moment M'Carthy, who
      was now present, heard the jolly pedlar's voice, he started, and felt
      considerably surprise. The tones of it were neither familiar to him nor
      yet were they strange. That he had heard them somewhere, and on some
      occasion, he could almost have sworn. Occasionally a turn of the man's
      voice would strike him as not being new to him, but again, for the next
      minute or two, it was such as he could not remember to have ever heard.
      This we say by way of parenthesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the gentlemen! Lord help you, Mr. Purcel, I never think of them when
      the ladies is before me&mdash;who would! However, I'm well prepared even
      for them. Here is a case o' razors that 'ud cut half an inch before the
      edge; now, if you find me another pair that'll do the seem&mdash;hem! the
      same&mdash;I'll buy the Bank of Ireland and give it to you for a
      new-year's-gift."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you know this gentleman?" asked the proctor, pointing to M'Carthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me see," said he&mdash;"we'll now&mdash;eh, no&mdash;I think not, he
      is neither so well made, nor by any manes so well lookin' as the other;"
      and the pedlar, as he spoke, fixed his eyes, but without seeming to gaze,
      upon Julia, who, on hearing a comparison evidently so disadvantageous to
      M'Carthy, blushed deeply, and passed to another part of the room, in order
      to conceal what she felt must have been visible, and might have excited
      observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," proceeded the pedlar; "I thought at first he was one of the
      left-legge'd M'Squiggins's, as they call them, from Fumblestown&mdash;but
      he is not, I know, for the raisons I said. They're a very good plain
      family, the M'Squiggins's, only that nobody's likely to fall in love wid
      them&mdash;upon my profits, I'm half inclined to think he's one of them
      still&mdash;eh, let me see again&mdash;would you turn round a little, if
      you plaise, sir, till I thry if the cast's in your eye. Upon my faith,
      there it is sure enough! How are you, Misther M'Squiggins? I'm happy to
      see you well, sir. How is your sisther, Miss Pugshey, an' all the family,
      sir?&mdash;all well, I hope, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All well," replied M'Carthy, laughing as loud as any of the rest, every
      one of whom actually in convulsions&mdash;for they knew, with the
      exception of Julia, who was deceived at first by the pedlar's apparent
      gravity, that he was only bantering her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proctor, who, although a man that loved money as his God&mdash;with
      his whole heart, soul, and strength&mdash;was yet exceedingly anxious to
      stand well with the world, and on this account never suffered a mere
      trifle to stand between him and the means of acquiring a good name, and
      having himself been considered a man of even of a benevolent spirit. He
      consequently made some purchase from the pedlar, with whom he held a very
      amusing and comic discussion, as touching the prices of many articles in
      that worthy's; pack. Nay, he went so far as to give them a good-humored
      exhibition of the secrets and peculiarities known only to the initiated,
      and bought some small matters in the slang terms with which none but the
      trade are acquainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, boys," said he, "I have set you a good example; won't you buy
      something from the jolly pedlar?"
    </p>
    <p>
      John and Alick bought some trifling things, and M'Carthy purchased a pair
      of bracelets for the girls, which closed the sales for that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, now," said the pedlar, whilst folding up again the goods which he
      had displayed for sale, "upon my profits, Misther Purcel, it's a perfect
      delight to me to call here, an' that whether I dale or not&mdash;although
      I'm sure to do so always when I come. Well, you have all dealt wid me now
      for payment, and here goes to give you something for nothing&mdash;an, in
      truth, it's a commodity that, although always chape, is seldom taken. 'Tis
      called good advice. The ladies&mdash;God bless them, don't stand in need
      of it, for sure the darlins' never did anything from Eve downwards, that
      'ud require it. Here it is then, Misther Purcel, let you and your sons do
      what the ould song says&mdash;'be good boys and <i>take care of
      yourselves. Thighin thu?</i> (*Do you understand.) An' this gintleman, if
      I knew his name, maybe I'd say something to him too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is Mr. M'Carthy, Cannie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, M'Carthy&mdash;troth 'tis a good ould name. Well, Mr. M'Carthy, all I
      have to say to you! is, that <i>if you happen to meet a man that gives you
      good advice, TAKE IT</i>. An' now God be Wid you all, an' spare you to one
      another!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he slung his huge pack over his shoulders almost without an
      effort, and commencing a merry old Irish song he proceeded lightly and
      cheerfully on his journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, boys," said the proctor, "now that we've had a good hearty laugh
      with the <i>Cannie Soogah</i>, let us proceed to business. I see by your
      red coats and top-boots, that you're for the hounds to-day, but as I'm in
      a hurry, I wish before you go, that you'd see those sneaking devils that
      are hanging about the place. Hourigan is there again with fresh falsehoods&mdash;don't
      be misled by him&mdash;the ill-looking scoundrel is right well able to pay&mdash;and
      dix me if I'll spare him. Tell him he needn't expect any further
      forbearance&mdash;a rascal that's putting money in the saving's bank to be
      pleadin' poverty! It's too bad. But the truth is, boys, there's no one
      behind in their tithes now entitled to forbearance, and for the same
      reason they must pay or take the consequences; we'll see whether they or
      the law will prove the strongest, and that very soon. Good-bye, boys;
      good-bye, M'Carthy&mdash;and I say, Jack and Alick, be on your sharps and
      don't let them lads do you&mdash;d'ye mind now?&mdash;keen's the word."
    </p>
    <p>
      He then got on his comfortable jaunting-car, and drove off to wait,
      according to appointment, upon the Rev. Jeremiah Turbot, D.D.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mogue Moylan," said John, "will you go out and tell them fellows that I
      and Alick will be in the office presently&mdash;and do you hear? tell them
      to look like men, and not so much like murderers that came to take our
      lives. Say we'll be in the office presently, and that we hope it's not
      excuses they're fetching us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will, Misther John; but, troth, it's the worst word in their cheek
      they'd give me, if I deliver the last part of your message. 'Tis my head
      in my fist I'd get, maybe; however, Misther John, between you an' me,
      they're an ill-looking set, one an' all o' them, an' could pay their
      tides, every tail o' them, if they wished."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that very well," replied the young fellow, "but my father's not
      the man to be trifled with. We'll soon see whether they or the law's the
      strongest; that's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Moylan went over to where the defaulters were standing, and putting up his
      hand, he stroked down his cheek with great gravity. "Are yez in a hurry,
      good people?" said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some of us is," replied a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, all of us," replied others; "and we're here now for an hour and a
      half, and no sign of seein' us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yez are in a hurry, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure we are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, to them that's in a hurry I've a word to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, Mogue?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, it is this, take your time&mdash;ever an' always, when you happen to
      be in a hurry&mdash;take your time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe, Mogue," they replied, "if you were widout your breakfast, as we
      are, you wouldn't say so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, did'nt yez get your breakfasts yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Devil a morsel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, to them that didn't get their breakfasts I have another word to
      say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, Mogue?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, have patience&mdash;ever and always when you're hungry, have
      patience, and you'll find it a great relief; it'll fill you and keep you
      in good condition&mdash;that I mayn't sin but it will! But, sure, I've got
      news for yez, boys," he added; "Masther John bid me tell you that, after
      about a month or so it'll be contrary to law to get hungry: there's an act
      o' parliament goin' to be made against it, you see; so that any villain
      disloyal enough to get hungry, if it's proved against him, will be liable
      to transportation. That I mayn't sin but it'll be a great comfort for the
      country&mdash;I mane, to have hunger made contrary to act o' parliament."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mogue Moylan was, indeed, a fellow of a very original and peculiar
      character. Grave, sly, and hypocritical, yet apparently quiet and not
      susceptible of strong or vehement emotions, he was, nevertheless, more
      suggestive of evil designs and their fulfilment than any man, perhaps, in
      his position of life that ever existed. Though utterly without spirit, or
      the slightest conception of what personal courage meant, the reader not be
      surprised that he was also vindictive, and consequently treacherous and
      implacable. He could project crime and outrage with a felecity of
      diabolical invention that was almost incredible. He was, besides, close
      and cautious, unless when he thought that he could risk a falsehood with
      safety; and, in the opinion of some few who knew him, not merely
      dishonest, but an actual thief. His manner, too, was full of plausible
      assumption of great conscientiousness and simplicity. He seemed always
      calm and cool, was considered rather of a religious turn, and always
      expressed a strong horror against cursing or swearing in any shape. Indeed
      he had a pat anecdote, which he occasionally told, of a swoon or faint
      into which he usually fell, when a youth of about nineteen, in consequence
      of having been forced to take a book oath, for the first time, another act
      against which he entertained a peculiar antipathy. Now, all this was
      indeed very singular and peculiar; but he accounted for it by the
      scrupulous love of truth with which not only he himself, but his whole
      family, many of whom he said had given their lives for their country, were
      affected. The only foible that could be brought to the charge of honest
      Mogue, was a singular admiration for his own visage, which he never
      omitted to survey with remarkable complacency several times a day in a
      broken piece of looking, glass, which he kept for that especial purpose.
      This, and its not unnatural consequences a belief that almost ever female
      who spoke to him with civility was smitten by his face and figure,
      constituted the only two weaknesses in a character otherwise so spotless
      and perfect as that of Mogue Moylan. Mogue was also a good deal subject to
      the influence of the pathetic, especially when he alluded to the
      misfortune, glory be to God, which had befallen the family, in the person
      of a lone line of ancestors, and especially in that of big poor, simple
      father, whose word, as every one knew, was as good as his oath; and,
      indeed, very few doubted that remarkable fact, but who, notwithstanding
      had been transported during the space of seven years for suspicion of
      perjury; "for didn't the judge tell him, when he passed sentence upon him,
      that if he had been found guilty all out, or of anything beyant suspicion
      of it, he would be transported for life; 'an' instead of that,' said the
      judge, 'bekaise I persave,' says he, 'that you're an honest man, an' has
      been sworn against wrongfully in this business, and bekaise I see clearly
      that you love the truth, the sentence of the coort is,' says he, sheddin'
      tears, 'that you're to be transported only for seven years, an' you lave
      the coort an' the counthry,' says he, 'widout at stain upon your character&mdash;it's
      only the law that's against you&mdash;so, God be wid you,' the judge went
      on, wipin' his eyes, 'and grant you a safe and pleasant voyage acrass,'
      says he, an' he cried for some minutes like a child. That an' the unjust
      hangin' of my poor, simple ould grandfather for horse-stearin'&mdash;that
      is, for suspicion of horse-stealin'&mdash;is the only two misfortunes,
      thank God, that has been in our family of late days."
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for the character of worthy Mogue, whom we must now permit to
      resume the delivery of his message.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last words were uttered with so peculiar and significant a gravity,
      not without a good deal of dry sarcastic humor, that the men could not
      avoid laughing heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," he proceeded, "I have better news still for yez. Sure Masther John
      desired me to let you all know that his father won't ax a penny o' tithe
      from one o' yez: all you have to do is to call at the office there in a
      few minutes, and you'll get aich o' you a receipt in full; (* By this he
      means a horse-whipping.) that is, if you don't keep civil tongues in your
      heads."
    </p>
    <p>
      One of Mogue's qualities was the power of gravely narrating a fact with
      such peculiar significance, that the very reverse of it was conveyed to
      the hearer; for the fellow was a perfect master of irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! well done Mogue; many a day o' reckoning <i>he</i> has had wid <i>us</i>,
      but maybe <i>our</i> day o' reckonin' wid <i>him</i> will come sooner than
      he expects, or wishes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be thinkin' ill," said Mogue, "but keep yourselves always free from
      evil. What does Scripthur say? 'One good turn desarves another,' says
      Scripthur. Boys, always keep Scripthur before you, and you'll do right.
      'One good turn deserves another,' says Scripthur! and you know yourselves,
      I hope, that many a good turn you received at his hands. That I may be
      happy, but it's good advice I'm givin' you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Divil a betther, Mogue," replied Hourigan, with a significant scowl, and
      "it's we ourselves that'll be sure to take it some fine night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Night or day," replied Mogue, "it's always right to be doin' good,
      whether we sarve our country or religion. God prosper yez, at all events,
      and grant you success in your endeavors, an' that's the worst I wish you!
      There now, Masther John's in the office, ready an' willin' to give sich o'
      yez a resate in full as will&mdash;desarve it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation in which the parties stood, during this dialogue, was at the
      rear of the premises into which the proctor's office opened, and where the
      country people were always desired to wait. They stood at the end of the
      stable, adjoining a wall almost eight feet high, on the other side of
      which was the pig-sty. Here, whilst the conversation just detailed went
      forward, stood a pretty, plump-looking, country-girl, one of the female
      servants of the proctor's establishment, named Letty Lenehan. She had come
      to feed the pigs, just in time to catch the greater portion of their
      conversation; and, as she possessed a tolerably clear insight into Mogue's
      character, she was by no means ignorant of certain illusions made in it,
      although she unquestionably did not comprehend its full drift. We have
      said that this girl understood his character very well, and scarcely any
      one had a better right or greater opportunities of doing so. Mogue, in
      fact, was in love with her, or at least, pretended to be so; but, whether
      he was or not, one thing we write as certain, that he most implicitly
      believed her to be so with himself. Letty was a well-tempered, faithful
      girl, honest and conscientious, but not without a considerable relish for
      humor, and with more than ordinary talents for carrying on either a
      practical joke or any other piece of harmless humbug, a faculty in which
      she was ably supported by a fellow-servant of a very different description
      from Mogue, named Jerry Joyce. Joyce, in fact, was not merely a strong
      contrast to Mogue, but his very reverse in almost every point of his
      character. He was open and artless in the opinion of many, almost to
      folly; but, under this apparent thoughtlessness, there existed a fund of
      good sense, excellent feeling, and quickness of penetration, for which the
      world gave him no credit, or at least but very little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerry and Letty, therefore, between whom a real affection subsisted, were
      in the habit of amusing themselves, whenever they could do so without
      discovery, at Mogue's expense. Such, then, was the relative position of
      these parties at the present stage of our narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      When John Purcel was seen in the office, the tithe defaulters, for such
      they were, went to the outside of the window, where they all stood until
      it became the turn of each to go in. Although they went there to plead
      their inability to pay, yet, in fact, there were a great proportion of
      them who exhibited, neither by their manner nor appearance, any symptom
      whatever of poverty. On the countenances of most of them might be read,
      not only a stern, gloomy, and resolute expression, but one of
      dissatisfaction and bitter resentment. As they turned their eyes upon
      young Purcel, and looked around at the unequivocal marks of great wealth,
      if not luxury itself, that were conspicuous in every direction, there was
      a significance in the smiles and glances which passed between them, that
      gave very appropriate foretaste of the convulsions which ere long took
      place in the country. John Purcel himself had remarked these appearances
      on almost every recent occasion, and it was the striking, or rather
      startling, aspect of these men, that caused him to allude to it just
      before sending Moylan to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not our intention to detail, at full length, the angry altercations
      which took place between them, as each went in, from time to time, to
      apologize for not paying up his tithes. Every possible excuse was offered;
      but so well and thoroughly were Purcel and his sons acquainted with the
      circumstances, of, we may say, almost every family, not merely in the
      parish, but in the barony itself, that it proved a matter of the greatest
      difficulty to mislead or impose on any of them. Nay, so anxious did the
      shrewd tithe-proctor feel upon this subject, that he actually got himself
      proposed and elected a governor of the Savings' Bank, which had been for
      some time past established in C&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;m. By this means, he
      was enabled to know that many of those who came to him with poverty on
      their lips, were actually lodging money in these economical institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Carey," said he, to a comfortable-looking man that entered, "I hope
      you have no further apology to offer for your dishonesty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorra thing, Mr. John, but that I'm not able to pay. I expect the
      landlord to come down upon me some o' these days&mdash;and what to do, or
      on what hand to turn, I'm sure I don't know on airth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't say so now, Carey?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Troth I do, Misther John; and I hope you'll spare me for a little&mdash;I
      mane till the hard times that's in it mends somehow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Carey, all I can say is, that, if you don't know on what hand to
      turn, I can tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Misther John; troth an' I do want to know that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen, then; before you come here to me with a barefaced and dishonest
      lie in your mouth, you ought to have gone to the C&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;m
      Savings' Bank, and drawn from the sum of two hundred and seventy-three
      pounds, which you have lying there, the slight sum of seven pounds twelve
      and nine-pence which you owe us. Now, Carey, I tell you that you are
      nothing but an impudent, scheming, dishonest scoundrel; and I say, once
      for all, that we will see whether you, and every knavish rascal like you,
      or the law of the land, is the stronger. Mark me now, you impudent knave,
      we shall never ask you again. The next time you see us will be at the head
      of a body of police, or a party of the king's troops; for I swear that, as
      sure as, the sun shines, so certainly will we take the tithe due out of
      your marrow, if we can get it nowhere else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe, then," said Carey, "you will find that we'll laugh at the law, the
      polis, the king's troops, and Misther John Purcel into the bargain; and I
      now tell you to your teeth, that if one sixpence of tithe would save the
      sowls of every one belongin' to you, I won't pay it&mdash;so do your
      worst, and I defy you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Begone, you scoundrel. You are, I perceive, as rank a rebel as ever
      missed the rope; but you won't miss it. Go home now; for, as I said this
      moment, we will take the tithe out of your marrow, if you had thousands of
      your cut-throat and cowardly White-boys at your back. Don't think this
      villainy will pass with us; we know how to handle you, and will too;
      begone, you dishonest ruffian, I have no more time to lose with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      In this manner almost every interview terminated. Purcel was a warm and
      impetuous young fellow, who certainly detested everything in the shape of
      dishonesty or deceit and here he had too many instances of both to be able
      to keep his temper, especially when he felt that he and his family were
      the sufferers. Other cases, however, were certainly very dissimilar to
      this; we allude especially to those of real distress, where the means of
      meeting the demand were not to be had. With such individuals the proctor's
      sons were disposed to be lenient, which is certainly more than could be
      said if he himself had to deal with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jemmy Mulligan," he said, to a poor-looking man, "go home to your family.
      We don't intend to take harsh measures with you, Jemmy; and you needn't
      come here again till we send for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God bless you, sir; troth I don't know why the people say that you're all
      hard and unfeelin'&mdash;I can say for myself that I never found you so.
      Good morning, sir, and thank you, Misther John; and God forgive them that
      blackens you as they do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Jemmy, I know they hate us, because we compel them to act honestly;
      but they will soon find that honesty, after all, is the cheapest course,&mdash;for
      we shall take d&mdash;d good care to make them pay through the nose for
      their knavery. We know they have a gang of firebrand agitators and hungry
      lawyers at their back; but we shall make them feel that the law is
      stronger than any treasonable combination that can be got up against it."
    </p>
    <p>
      A third man came in. "Well, Tom, you're not coming to plead poverty, I
      hope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The man looked around him with peculiar intelligence. "Are we safe?" he
      asked; "and may I spake widout danger?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may, Duggan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, I came to say that I'll call over to-morrow evenin' and pay
      it, but I daren't now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so, Tom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bekaise the most of us all have the tithe in our pockets, but as a proof
      that we did not pay it, we will, every man of us, be obliged to show it
      before we go home. I might pay it now, Mr. Purcel; but then, if I did, it'
      very likely I'd be a corpse before this day week. Sich is the state that
      things ha' come to; and how it'll end, God only knows. At any rate, I'll
      slip over afther dusk to-morrow evenin' and pay; but as you hope for
      mercy, and don't wish to see me taken from my wife and childre', don't
      breathe a syllable of it to man or mortual."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall not, indeed, Tom," replied Purcel, "but I really did not think
      that matters were altogether so bad as you describe them. The people are
      infatuated, and will only draw the vengeance of the law upon their heads.
      They will suffer, as they always do by their own misconduct and madness."
    </p>
    <p>
      Duggan had scarcely withdrawn, when our old friend, Darby Hourigan, thrust
      in his hateful and murderous-looking countenance. "God save you, Misther
      John."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God save you kindly, Misther Hourigan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't it glorious weather for the saison, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have seen better and I have seen worse, Mr. Hourigan; but Darby,
      passing the weather by, which neither you nor I can mend, allow me to say
      that I hope you are not coming here for the twentieth time to palm us off
      about the tithe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Troth, then, and, Mr. John; I can't afford to pay tide&mdash;I'm a poor
      man, sir; and, as it happens that I never trouble the parson in religious
      matthers, I don't see what right the parson has to trouble me for my
      money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! you have got the cant, I see. You have been tutored."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have got the truth, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, but have you got the tithe, sir? for I do assure you, Mr. Hourigan,
      that it is not your logic, but your money I want."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Begad, sir, and I'm afeard you'll be forced to put up wid my logic this
      time, too. You can't take more from the cat than her skin, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an atrocious and sneering spirit, not only in this ruffian's
      manner, but in the tones of his voice, that was calculated to overcome
      human patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Darby, we have let you run a long time, but I now tell you, there's an
      end of our forbearance so far as you are concerned. If you were not able
      to pay I could feel for you, put we know, and all the world knows, that
      you are one of the most comfortable and independent men in the parish.
      Darby, you in short are a d&mdash;d rogue, and what is worse, a
      treacherous and mischief-makin scoundrel. I am aware of the language you
      use against our whole family, whom you blacken whenever you have an
      opportunity of doing so. You are not only dishonest but ungrateful,
      sirrah."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No man has a betther right to be a judge, and a good judge of dishonesty,
      than your father's son," replied Hourigan. "Why didn't you call me an
      oppressor of the poor, and a blood-sucker?&mdash;why didn't you say I was
      a hard-hearted beggarly upstart, that rose from maneness and cheatery, and
      am now tyrannizin' over hundreds that's a thousand times betther than
      myself? Why don't you say that I'd sell my church and my religion to their
      worst enemies, and that for the sake of filthy lucre and blackguard
      upstart pride? I now come to tell you what we all think of you in this
      country, and what I believe some of us has tould you already&mdash;that
      you may go to hell for your tithe, and make the divil your paymaster, what
      he'll be yet. We will pay you none, and we set you and your upstart ould
      rogue of a father, with the law, the polis, and the army, all at defiance.
      I don't choose to say more, but I could if I liked."
    </p>
    <p>
      Purcell's hunting-whip accidentally lay on the table at which he sat, but
      he did not take it up immediately after Hourigan had concluded. He quickly
      rose, however, and having closed the door and locked it, he let down the
      windows, and deliberately drew the blinds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, you scoundrel," he replied, taking up the whip, and commencing to
      flog Hourigan with all his strength, which was very great, "I will give
      you, by way of foretaste, a specimen of what a ruffian like you deserves
      when he is insolent."
    </p>
    <p>
      With such singular energy, good will, and admirable effect did he lace Mr.
      Hourigan, that the latter worthy, after cutting some very antic capers,
      and exhibiting in a good many other respects several proofs of his agility
      that could scarcely be expected from his heavy and ungainly figure, was at
      last fairly obliged to sing out,&mdash;"Oh, Misther John, Misther John!
      you will&mdash;Misther John, darlin', what do you mane, you murdh&mdash;oh,
      oh, d&mdash;n your soul&mdash;dear, what do you mane, Mr. John, dear? I
      say, what are you at? What do you baste me this way for&mdash;oh, may the
      divil&mdash;the Lord bless you, an' don't&mdash;here I am&mdash;here,
      Misther John, I ax your pardon&mdash;hell pursue&mdash;Misther John,
      darlin', I go down on my knees to you, an' axes your pardon&mdash;here now
      you see, I'm down.&mdash;Och murdher, am I to have the very sowl welted
      out o' me this way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. John, having now satisfied himself, and left very visible marks of his
      attachment and good will to Hourigan, upon that individual's face and
      person, desired him to get up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, my good fellow," he exclaimed, "I trust I have taught you a lesson
      that you won't forget."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Misther John," he replied, rising and rubbing himself in different
      parts of the body, as if to mitigate the pain which he felt; "no, I won't
      forget it&mdash;I won't by it's a lesson I'll remember, and so will you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean, you cowardly villain?" asked Purcel, once more raising
      his whip. "You are threatening, are you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Misther John, not a bit o' that&mdash;divil a threat&mdash;me! I
      wouldn't threaten you if there wasn't niver another man in Europe. Let me
      out, if you plaise&mdash;let me out, and may the div&mdash;the Lord lov
      you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," said the other, raising the blinds and afterwards opening the door,
      "you may go about your business, and mark me, Mr Hourigan&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do, sir," replied the other, bolting out "oh, God knows I do&mdash;you
      have marked me, Misther Purcel, and I will mark you, sir&mdash;for&mdash;"
      he added muttering in a low voice to those who stood about him&mdash;"one
      good turn desarves another, anyhow."
    </p>
    <p>
      We shall not now dwell upon the comments which young Purcel's violence
      drew from the defaulters on their way home. Our reader, however, may
      easily imagine them, and form for themselves a presentiment of the length
      to which "the tithe insurrection," as they termed it, was likely to
      proceed throughout the country at large, with the exception only of the
      northern provinces.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.&mdash;A Hang-Choice Shot&mdash;The "Garrison" on Short Commons.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When our merry friend the pedlar left the proctor's parlor, he proceeded
      at a brisk pace in the direction of the highway, which, however, was not
      less than three-quarters of a mile from Longshot Lodge, which was the name
      Purcel had given to his residence. He had only got clear of the offices,
      however, and was passing the garden wall, which ran between him and the
      proctor's whole premises, when he was arrested by Mogue Moylan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! merry Mogue," exclaimed the pedlar, ironically, "I was missin' you.
      Where were you, my cherub?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was in the barn 'ithin," replied Mogue, "just offerin' up a little
      pathernavy for the protection o' this house and place, and of the daicent,
      kind-hearted peeople that's in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An', as a joint prayer, they say, is worth ten single ones, I suppose,"
      returned the pedlar,&mdash;laying his fingers on his lips and winking&mdash;"you
      had&mdash;ahem&mdash;you understand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, thin," replied Mogue, brightening up with excessive vanity, "may I be
      happy if I do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, our fair friend, Letty Lenehan&mdash;begad, Mogue, she's a purty
      girl that&mdash;says she to herself," proceeded the pedlar; "for I don't
      think she knew or thought I heard her&mdash;'If I thought he would like
      these rib-bons, I'd buy them for myself.' 'Who do you mane, acushla?' says
      I, whisperin' to her. 'Who,' says she, 'but&mdash;but Mogue himself&mdash;only
      honor bright, Mr. Magrath' says she, 'sure you wouldn't betray me?' 'Honor
      bright again,' says I, 'I'm not the stuff a traitor's made of;' and so you
      see we both laughed heartily, bekaise we understood one another. Mogue,"
      proceeded the other, "will you answer me the truth in one thing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I can I will, Misther Magrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know ye will, bekaise you can," replied, the pedlar; "how do you come
      round the girls at all? how do you make them fond o' you? I want you to
      tell me that, if it's not a family saicret."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mogue gravely drew his fingers and thumb down his thin yellow jaws, until
      they met under his chin, and replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "It can't be tould, Misther Magrath; some men the women's naturally fond
      of, and some men they can't bear&mdash;throth it's like a freemason's
      saicret, if you wor a man that the women wor naturally fond of you'd know
      it yoarself, but not bein' that, Mr. Magrath, you could not understand it.
      It's born wid one, an' troth, a troublesome gift it is&mdash;for it is a
      gift&mdash;at least, I find it so. There's no keep in' the crathurs oft o'
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Begad, you must be a happy man, Mogue. I wish I was like you&mdash;but
      whisper, man alive, why don't you look higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is that?" asked the other, now apparently awakened to a new interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mogue," said the pedlar, with something like solemnity of manner, "you
      and I are both embarked in the same ship, you know&mdash;we know how
      things are to go. I'm now provin' to you that I'm your friend. Listen, you
      passed through the back-yard to-day while I was in the parlor wid the
      family sellin' my goods as well as I could. Well, Miss Julia had a
      beautiful shawl about her purty shoulders, and as she seen you passin, she
      started, kept her eyes fixed upon you till you disappeared, and then,
      afther thinkin 'or some time, she sighed deeply. Whisper, the thing
      flashed upon me&mdash;that's that, thought I, at any rate&mdash;and devil
      a doubt of it, you're safe there, or my name's not Andy Magrath, better
      known as the Cannie Soogah-Hurra, Mogue, more power!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A richer comic study than Mogue's face ould not possibly be depicted. His
      thin craggy jaws&mdash;for cheeks he had none&mdash;were winkled and
      puckered into such a multiplicity of villanous folds and crevices, as
      could scarcely be paralleled on a human countenance; and what added to the
      ludicrous impression made, was the fact that he endeavored to look&mdash;and,
      in fact, did so successfully&mdash;more like a man who felt that a secret
      long known to himself had been discovered, than a person to whom the
      intelligence had come for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' Misther Magrath," he replied, once more repeating the survey of his
      puckered laws; "is it by way of information that you tould me that? That I
      mayn't sin, but you should be ever and always employed in carryin' coals
      to, Newcastle. Troth, since you have broached\the thing, I've known it
      this good while, and no one could tell you more about it, if I liked.
      Honor bright, however, as poor Letty said, troth, I pity that girl&mdash;but
      what can I do? no&mdash;no&mdash;honor bright, for ever!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, anyhow, now that we've thrown light upon what I noticed a while
      ago, let us talk about other matters. The house is still well armed and
      guarded, you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I may die in grace, but it 'ud take me half an hour to reckon all
      the guns, pistols, and blunderbushes they have freshly loaded in the house
      every night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, couldn't you assist us, you in the house?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;for I'm not in the house; they wouldn't allow any servant to
      sleep in the house for fear o' traichery, and they say so. If they'd let
      me sleep in the house, it 'ud be another thing; I might wet the powdher,
      and make their fire-arms useless; but sure they have lots of swords and
      bagnets, and daggers, and other instruments o' that kind that 'ud skiver
      one like a rabbit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, but you know all the outs and ins of the house, the rooms and
      passages, and everything that way so thoroughly, that one could depend
      upon your account of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Depend upon them&mdash;ay, as well as you might upon the Gospel itself;&mdash;she
      was fond of M'Carthy, they say, and they think she is still; but, <i>be
      dhu husth</i>, (* Hold your tongue.) there's one that knows betther. You
      don't like M'Carthy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure I do, as the devil does holy wather."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," proceeded Mogue, "I've a thing in my head about him&mdash;but sure
      he's in the black list as it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what is it you have in your head about him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mogue shook it, but added, "Never mind, I'll think it over again, and when
      I'm made up on it, maybe I'll tell you. Don't we meet on this day week?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sartainly, will you come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I intend it, for the truth is, Misther Magrath, that the Millstone must
      be broke; that I may die in pace, but it must, an' any one that stands in
      the way of it must suffer. May I be happy, but they must."
    </p>
    <p>
      The pedlar looked cautiously about him, and seeing that the coast was
      clear and no person visible, he thrust a letter into his hand, adding,
      "you may lave it in some place where the ould chap, or either of the sons,
      will be sure to find it. Maybe it'll tache them a little more civility to
      their neighbors."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mogue looked at the document, and placing it securely in his pocket,
      asked, "Is it a notice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The other nodded in the affirmative, and added, with a knowing wink,
      "There's a coffin and a cross-bones in it, and the name is signed wid real
      blood, Mogue; and that's the way to go about breakin' the Millstone, my
      man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I may never do an ill turn, but it is. Well, God bless you, Misther
      Magrath, an' whisper now, don't forget an odd patther-anavy goin' to bed,
      in hopes that God will prosper our honest endayvours. That was a hard
      thing upon young Devlin in Murray's murdher. I'm not sure whether you do,
      but I know that that act was put upon him through ill-will; and now he'll
      hang for it. But sure it's one comfort that he'll die a martyr, glory be
      to God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The pedlar, having assented to this, got on his pack, and leaving Mogue to
      meditate on the new discovery which he had made respecting Julia Purcel,
      he proceeded on towards the highway to which we have alluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Purcel himself, in the course of a few miles' drive, reached the
      parsonage, in which the Rev. Jeremiah Turbot ought to have lived, but in
      which, for several years past, he had not resided; if we except about a
      fortnight twice a year, when he came to sweep off as weighty a load of
      tithes as he could contrive to squeeze out of the people through worthy
      Mat Purcel, his proctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a year or two previous to this visit, there is no doubt but the aspect
      of ecclesiastical affairs was gradually getting worse. Turbot began to
      feel that there was something wrong, although he could not exactly say
      what it was. Purcel, however, was by no means reluctant to disclose to him
      the exceedingly desperate state to which not only had matters been
      driving, but at which they had actually arrived. This, in truth, was our
      worthy proctor's version of ecclesiastical affairs, for at least two years
      before the present period of our narrative. But, like every man who
      tampers with, simple truth, he began to perceive, almost when it was too
      late, that his policy in antedating the tithe difficulties was likely very
      soon to embarrass himself; and to deprive the outrages resulting from the
      frightful opposition that was organized against tithes of all claim to
      novelty. He had, in fact, so strongly exaggerated the state of the
      country, and surcharged his pictures of anti-tithe violence so much beyond
      all truth and reality, that when the very worst and most daring
      organization did occur, he could do nothing more than go over the same
      ground again. The consequence was, that worthy Turbot, so long habituated
      to these overdrawn narratives, began to look upon them as the friends of
      the boy who shouted out "wolf!" did upon the veracity of his alarms. He
      set down his intrepid and courageous proctor as nothing else than a
      cowardly poltroon, whose terrors exaggerated everything, and whose
      exaggerated accounts of fraud, threats, and violence had existed
      principally in his own imagination. Such were the circumstances under
      which Purcel and Dr. Turbot now met.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worthy rector of Ballysoho was a middle-sized man, with coal-black
      hair, brilliant, twinkling eyes of the same color, and as pretty a double
      chin as ever graced the successor of an apostle. Turbot was by no means an
      offensive person; on the contrary, he must of necessity have been very
      free from evil or iniquity of any kind, inasmuch as he never had time to
      commit sin. He was most enthusiastically addicted to hunting and shooting,
      and felt such a keen and indomitable relish for the good things of this
      world, especially for the luxuries of the table, that what between looking
      after his cuisine, attending his dogs, and enjoying his field sports, he
      scarcely ever might be said to have a single day that he could call his
      own. And yet, unreasonable people expected that a man, whose daily
      occupations were of such importance to&mdash;himself, should very coolly
      forego his own beloved enjoyments in order to attend to the comforts of
      the poor, with whom he had scarcely anything in common. Many other matters
      of a similar stamp were expected from him, but only by those who had no
      opportunity of knowing the multiplicity of his engagements. Such persons
      were unreasonable enough to think that he ought to have occasionally
      appropriated some portion of his income to the relief of poverty and
      destitution, but as he said himself, he could not afford it. How could any
      man afford it who in general lived up to, and sometimes beyond, his
      income, and who was driven to such pinches as not unfrequently to incur
      the imputation of severity and oppression itself, by the steps he was
      forced to take or sanction for the recovery of his tithes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In person he was, as we have said, about or somewhat under the middle
      size. In his gait he was very ungainly. When walking, he drove forward as
      if his head was butting or boring its way through a palpable atmosphere,
      keeping his person, from the waist up, so far in advance that the <i>a
      posteriori</i> portion seemed as if it had been detached from the other,
      and was engaged in a ceaseless but ineffectual struggle to regain its
      position; or, in shorter and more intelligible words, the latter end of
      him seemed to be perpetually in pursuit of his head and shoulders, without
      ever being able to overtake them. Whilst engaged in maintaining this
      compound motion, his elbows and arms swung from right to left, and vice
      versa, very like the movements of a weaver throwing the shuttle from side
      to side. Turbot had one acknowledged virtue in a pre-eminent degree, we
      mean hospitality. It is true he gave admirable dinners, but it would be a
      fact worth boasting of, to find any man at his table who was not able to
      give, and who did give, better dinners than himself. The doctor's face,
      however, in spite of his slinging and ungainly person, was upon the whole
      rather good. His double chin, and the full, rosy expression of his lips
      and mouth, betokened, at the very least, the force of luxurious habits,
      and, as a hedge school-master of our acquaintance used to say, the
      smallest taste in life of voluptuousity; whilst from his black, twinkling
      eyes, that seemed always as if they were about to herald a jest, broke
      forth, especially when he conversed with the softer sex, something which
      might be considered as holding a position between a laugh and a leer. Such
      was the Rev. Jeremiah Turbot, to whom we shall presently take the liberty
      of introducing the reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parsonage, to which our friend Purcel is now making his approach, was
      an excellent and comfortable building. It stood on a very pretty eminence,
      and consequently commanded a beautiful prospect both in front and rear;
      for the fact was, that in consequence of the beauty of the scenery for
      miles about it, some incumbent of good taste had given it a second hall
      door, thus enabling the inhabitants to partake of a double enjoyment, by
      an equal facility of contemplating the exquisite scenery of the country
      both in front and rear. A beautiful garden lay facing the south, and a
      little below, in the same direction, stood a venerable old rookery, whilst
      through the rich, undulating fields flowed, in graceful windings, a
      beautiful river, on whose green and fertile banks sheep and black cattle
      were always to be seen, sometimes feeding or chewing the cud in that
      indolent repose which gives to the landscape, in the golden light of a
      summer's evening, such a poetical and pastoral effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Purcel, on coming in sight of the parsonage, instead of keeping his horse
      to the rapid pace at which he had driven him along until then, now drew
      him up, and advanced at a rate which seemed to indicate anything but that
      of a man whose spirits were cheerful or free from care. On reaching the
      front entrance he discounted very slowly, and with a solemn and melancholy
      air, walked deliberately, step by step, till he stood at the hall door,
      where he gave a knock so spiritless, depressed and disconsolate, that it
      immediately communicated itself, as was intended, to the usually joyful
      and rosy countenance of the rector, who surveyed, his agent as if he
      expected to hear that he either had lost, or was about to lose, half his
      family or the whole of his wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you do, Purcel?&mdash;eh, what's this? Is there anything wrong?
      You look very much dejected&mdash;what's the matter? Sit down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir; but I really do not think I am well&mdash;at least my
      spirits are a great deal depressed; but indeed, Dr. Turbot, a man must be
      more or less than a man to be able to keep up his spirits in such times."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! ho, my worthy proctor, is that all? Thank you for nothing, Purcel. I
      understand you; but you ought to know I am not to be caught now by your
      'calamities'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My calamities! I declare to goodness, Dr. Turbot, I could rest contented
      if they were nobody's calamities but my own; unfortunately, however, you
      are as deep in them as I am, and in a short time, God knows, we will be a
      miserable pair, I fear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all, Purcel&mdash;this is only the old story. Raw-heads and
      bloody-bones coming to destroy the tithes, and eat up the parsons. Let me
      see&mdash;it is now three years since you commenced these 'lamentations.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three years ago; why we had peace and quietness then compared to what we
      have at present," replied Purcel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what have we now, pray?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, sir, the combinations against tithes is quite general over the whole
      country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well; so was it then upon your own showing. Go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I said, sir, it was nothing at that time. There is little now but
      threatening notices that breathe of blood and murder."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good; so was it then upon your own showing. Go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But of late, sir, lives have been taken. Clergymen have been threatened
      and fired at."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good; so was it then upon you! own showing. Go on, I say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fired at I say, and shot, sir. The whole White boy system has turned
      itself into a great tithe conspiracy. The farmers, the landholders of all
      descriptions, the cottiers, the daily laborers, and the very domestic
      servants, have all joined this conspiracy, and sworn neither to pay tithes
      themselves nor to allow others to pay them. They compare the established
      church to a garrison; and although the law prevents them from openly
      destroying it by force, they swear that they'll starve it out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh!" said Turbot, starting, "what's that you say? Starve us out! What an
      infamous and unconstitutional project! What a diabolical procedure! But I
      forgot&mdash;bravo, Purcel! This was all the case before upon your own
      showing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sir," returned Purcel, "there was at least this difference, that I
      was able to get something out of them then, but devil a copper can I get
      out o' them now. I think you'll admit, sir, that this fact gives some
      weight to my argument."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't mean to say, Purcel," replied the other, from whose chin the
      rosy tint gradually paled away until it assumed that peculiar hue which is
      found inside of a marine shell, that is to say, white with a dream of red
      barely and questionably visible; "you don't mean to say, my good friend
      Purcel, that you have no money for me on this occasion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By no means, sir," replied the proctor. "Money I have got for you, no
      doubt&mdash;money I have got certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      The double chin once more assumed its natural hue of celestial rosy red."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my honor, Purcel," he replied, "I have not temper for this; it seems
      to me that you take particular delight in wantonly tampering with my
      feelings. I am really quite tired of it. Why harass and annoy me with your
      alarms? Conspiracy, blood, and massacre are the feeblest terms in your
      vocabulary. It is absolutely ridiculous, sir, and I beg you will put an
      end to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would be very glad to do so, sir," replied Purcel; "and still more
      satisfied if I had never had anything to do with the temporalities of your
      church."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see why, above all men living, you should say so, Purcel; you
      have feathered your nest tolerably well by the temporalities of our
      church."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I have, sir," replied the proctor, "it has been at the expense of my
      popularity and good name. I and my family are looked upon as a part and
      parcel of your system, and, I may add, as the worst and most odious part
      of it. I and they are looked upon as the bitterest enemies of the people;
      and because we endeavor to get out of them the means of enabling you to
      maintain your rank in the world, we are obliged to hear ourselves branded
      every day in the week as villains, oppressors, and blood-suckers. This,
      however, we could bear; but to know that we are marked down for violence,
      brutality, and, if possible, assassination, is a penalty for which nothing
      in your establishment could compensate us. I and my sons have received
      several notices of violence in every shape, and we are obliged to sleep
      with our house half filled with arms and ammunition, in dread of an attack
      every night in the year."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well," replied Turbot, "this, after all, is but the old story; the
      matter is only an ebullition, and will pass away. I know you are
      constitutionally timid. I know you are; and have in fact a great deal of
      the natural coward in your disposition; and I say natural, because a man
      is no more to be blamed for being born a coward than he is for being born
      with a bad complexion or an objectionable set of features. You magnify the
      dangers about you, and, in fact, become a self-tormentor. As for my part,
      I am glad you have got money, for I do assure you, I never stood so much
      in need of it in my life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The very papers, sir," continued Purcel, who could not prevent himself
      from proceeding, "might enable you to see the state of the country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, d&mdash;n the papers," said the parson, "I am sick of them. Our side
      is perpetually exaggerating matters&mdash;just as you are; and as for the
      other side, your papist rags I never, of course, see or wish to see. I
      want six hundred now, or indeed eight if you can, and I had some notion of
      taking a day or two's shooting. How is the game on the glebe? Has it been
      well preserved, do you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not aware," said the proctor, "that any one has shot over the glebe
      lands this season; but if you take my advice, sir, you will expose
      yourself as little as you can in the neighborhood. There are not two
      individuals in the parish so unpopular as Dr. Turbot and your humble
      servant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, then," replied the other, "the less delay I make here the
      better&mdash;you can let me have six hundred, I hope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I certainly told you, sir," replied Purcel, with something of a
      determined and desperate coolness about him, "that I had money for you,
      and so I have."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Purcel; I must say you certainly have, on all occasions,
      exerted yourself faithfully and honestly in support of my interests."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Money, sir," pursued the other, without appearing to look to the right or
      to the left, "I have for you. Would you venture to guess to what amount?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, under the circumstances you speak of, less, I dare say, than I
      expect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been able to get, within the last six months, exactly fifty-nine
      pounds thirteen and sevenpence!"
    </p>
    <p>
      If the ebb which we have described before of the blood from the doctor's
      double chin was a gradual one, we can assure the reader that, in this
      case, it was rapid in proportion to the terror and dismay conveyed by this
      authentic, but astounding piece of intelligence. The whole face became
      pale, his eyes at once lost their lustre, and were, as he fixed them in
      astonishment upon the proctor, completely without speculation; his voice
      became tremulous, and, as he pulled out his handkerchief to wipe away the
      unexpected perspiration which the proctor's words had brought out upon his
      forehead, his hands trembled as if he had been suddenly seized with palsy.
      In truth, Purcel, who had a kind of good-natured regard for the little
      man, felt a sensation of compassion for him, on witnessing the
      extraordinary distress under which he labored.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry for this," said he, "for I really know not what is to be done,
      and, what is equally distressing, our prospects are not at all likely to
      improve."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't mean to say, Purcel, that circumstances are as bad as you
      report them&mdash;as bad&mdash;as desperate, I should say&mdash;and as
      ruinous?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fear," said Purcel, "they go beyond the gloomiest and most desponding
      views you could take of them. The conspiracy, for such we must term it,
      is, in point of fact, deepening down to the very foundations, if I may use
      the expression, of society. Every day it is becoming more dangerous and
      alarming; but how it is to be checked or mitigated, or how we are to stand
      out of its way and avoid its consequences, heaven only knows, for I
      don't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Purcel, my dear friend, what am I and my domestic establishment to
      do? Good God! there is nothing but ruin before us! You know I always lived
      up to my income&mdash;indeed, at best, it was too limited for the demands
      of my family, and our habits of life. And now, to have the very prop&mdash;the
      only one on which I leant&mdash;suddenly snapt from under me&mdash;it is
      frightful. But you are to blame, Purcel; you are much to blame. Why did
      you not apprise me of this ruinous state of things before it came thus on
      me unawares? It was unfeeling and heartless in you not to have prepared me
      for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The proctor actually imagined, and not without reason, that the worthy
      doctor was beginning to get beside himself, as it is termed, on hearing
      such a charge as this brought against him; and he was about to express his
      astonishment at it, when Mr. Temple, his curate, who resided in the
      parsonage, made his appearance, and joined them at Dr. Turbot's request.
      "Temple," said he, as the latter portion of his body began to pursue the
      other through the room, "are you aware of the frightful condition to which
      the country has come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who can be ignorant of it?" replied Temple; "how can any man live in the
      country, and not know it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir," replied Turbot, tartly, "I have lived in the country, and,
      until a few minutes ago, I was ignorant of the extent to which it has
      come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sir," said Temple, "that is odd enough; for, to my own knowledge,
      your information has been both regular and authentic upon this subject at
      all events. Our friend Purcel, here, has not left you in ignorance of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Turbot, "but he had the country as bad three years ago as it
      is now. Was this fair? Why, I took it for granted that all his alarms and
      terrors were the mere play and subterfuge of the proctor upon the parson,
      and, consequently, thought little of it; but here I am stranded at once,
      wrecked, and left on my bottom. How will I meet my tradesmen? how will I
      continue my establishment? and, what is worse, how can I break it up? You
      know, Temple, I cannot, unfortunately, live without luxuries. They are
      essential to my health, and if suddenly deprived of them, as I am likely
      to be, I cannot answer to society for the consequences."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," said Temple, "it is quite obvious that a period of severe trial and
      chastening is at hand, or I should rather say, has already arrived. Many
      of our calling, I am grieved I to know, are even now severely suffering,
      and suffering, I must add, with unexampled patience and fortitude under
      great and trying privations. Yet I trust that the health of the general
      body will be improved by it, and purged of the grossness and worldly
      feeling which have hitherto, I fear, too much characterized it. Many, I
      know, may think we are merely in the hands of man, but for my part, I
      think, and earnestly hope, that we are in those of God himself, and that
      He chasteneth no only because He loveth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is most distressing to hear, my dear Temple," replied his rector;
      "but I trust I am as willing and as well prepared, from religious feeling,
      to suffer as another&mdash;that is, provided always I am not deprived of
      those comforts and little luxuries to which I have all my life been
      accustomed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very much afraid," observed Purcel, "that the clergy of the
      established church will have a very fine opportunity to show the world how
      well and patiently they can suffer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have already said, Purcel," said the doctor, "that I am as willing to
      suffer as another. I know I am naturally of a patient and rather an humble
      disposition; let these trials come then, and I am prepared for them,
      provided only that I am not deprived of my little luxuries, for these are
      essential to my health itself, otherwise I could bear even this loss. I
      intended, Temple, to have had a day or two's shooting on the glebe lands,
      but Purcel, here, tells me that I am very unpopular, and would not, he
      says, recommend me to expose myself much, or if possible at all, in the
      neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And upon my word and credit I spoke nothing," replied the other, "but
      what I know to be truth. There is not a feather of game on the glebe lands
      that would be shot down with half the pleasure that the parson himself
      would. I beg, then, Dr. Turbot, that you won't think of it. I'll get my
      sons to go over the property, and if there's any game on it we shall have
      it sent to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How does it stand for game, Temple, do you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really cannot say," replied the good man. "The killing of game is a
      pursuit I have never relished, and with which I am utterly unacquainted. I
      fear, however, that the principal game in the country will soon be the
      parson and the proctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a delightful pursuit," replied the Rev. Doctor, who did not at all
      relish the last piece of information, and only replied to the first, "and
      equally conducive to health and morals. What, for instance, can be more
      delicious than a plump partridge or grouse, stewed in cinnamon and claret?
      and yet, to think that a man must be deprived of&mdash;well," said he,
      interrupting himself, "it is a heavy, and awful dispensation&mdash;and one
      that I ought to have been made acquainted with&mdash;that is, to its full
      and fearful extent&mdash;before it came on me thus unawares. Purcel here
      scarcely did his duty by me in this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fear, sir," replied Temple, "that it was not Purcel who neglected his
      duty, but you who have been incredulous. I think he has certainly not
      omitted to sound the alarm sufficiently loud during the approach of this
      great ordeal to which we are exposed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And in addition to everything else, I am in arrears to you, Temple," he
      added; "and now I have no means of paying you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple was silent, for at that moment the necessities of his family
      pressed with peculiar severity upon himself&mdash;and he was not exactly
      prepared for such an intimation. The portion of salary then coming to him
      was, in truth, his sole dependence at that peculiar crisis, and this
      failing him, he knew not on what hand or in what direction to turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      After musing for some time, he at length replied, "If you have it not, Dr.
      Turbot, or cannot procure it, of course it is idle for me to expect it&mdash;although
      I will not deny, that in the present circumstances of my family, it would
      have come to us with very peculiar and seasonable relief."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I have not a pound," replied the doctor; "so far from that, I am
      pretty deeply in debt&mdash;for I need hardly say, that for years I have
      been balancing my affairs&mdash;paying off debts to-day, and contracting
      other to-morrow&mdash;always dipped, but and rather deeply, too, as I
      said."
    </p>
    <p>
      He again got to his legs, when the pursuit of the latter part of his
      person after the rest once more took place, and in this odd way he
      traversed the room in a state of extreme tribulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is to be done?" he asked&mdash;"surely the government cannot abandon
      us?&mdash;cannot allow us to perish utterly, which we must do, if left to
      the mercy of our enemies? No, certainly it cannot desert us in such a
      strait as this, unless it wishes to surrender the established church to
      the dark plots and designing ambition of popery. No, no&mdash;it cannot&mdash;it
      must not&mdash;it dares not. Some vigorous measure for our relief must be
      taken, and that speedily;&mdash;let us not be too much dejected, then&mdash;our
      sufferings will be short&mdash;and as for myself, I am willing to make any
      reasonable sacrifice, provided I am not called upon&mdash;at these years&mdash;fifty-eight&mdash;to
      give up my usual little luxuries. Purcel, I want you to take a turn in the
      garden. Temple, excuse me&mdash;will you?&mdash;and say to Mrs. Temple to
      make no preparations, as I don't intend to stop&mdash;I shall return to
      Dublin in an hour at farthest; and don't be cast down, Temple; matters
      will soon brighten."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not at all necessary, sir," replied Temple, "that you should adjorn
      to the garden to speak with Mr. Purcel. I was on my way to the library
      when I met you, and I am going there now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not so much," he replied, "that I have anything very particular to
      say to Purcel, as that I feel a walk in the fresh air will relieve me.
      Good-bye, then, for a little; I shall see you before I go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Purcel," said he, when they had reached the garden, "this, after
      all, is only a false alarm, or even if it be not, we know that the
      government could by no means afford to abandon the established church in
      Ireland, because that would be, in other words, to reject the aid of, and
      sever themselves from all connection with, the whole Protestant party; and
      you, as a man of sense, Purcel, need not be told that it is only by the
      existence of a Protestant party in this country that they are enabled to
      hold it in union with England at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what has that to do with our present distresses?" said the proctor,
      who, as he probably began to anticipate the doctor's ultimate object in
      this conversation, very shrewdly associated himself rather in an official
      spirit with the embarrassments of his friend, and the church in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It has considerably," replied Dr. Turbot; "for instance, there will be no
      risk whatsoever, in lending to many of the embarrassed clergy sums of
      money upon their! personal security, until this pressure passes away, and
      their prosperity once more returns."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, ho, doctor," thought his sharp and wily companion, "I believe I have
      you now, Well, Dr. Turbot," he replied, "I think, the case, even as you
      put it, will be attended with difficulties. What, for instance, is
      personal security from a poor or a ruined man? very little, or rather
      nothing. Still it is possible that many, relying upon the proverbial honor
      and integrity of the Irish Protestant clergy, may actually lend money upon
      this security. But then," he added, with a smile, "those who will, must
      belong to a peculiar and privileged class."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," asked Turbot, "to what class do you allude?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To one with which," said the proctor, "I unfortunately have no connection&mdash;I
      mean the class that can afford to lend it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Purcel," said Dr. Turbot, "I am sorry to hear this ungenerous observation
      from you; I did not expect it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you call it ungenerous, sir?" asked Purcel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because," replied Turbot, "it is obvious that it was made in anticipation
      of a favor which I was about to ask of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I can grant you any favor," replied the proctor, "I shall be most
      happy to do so;&mdash;if you will only let me know what it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must be particularly dull not to perceive it," replied the parson,
      "aware, as you are, of the unexpected state of my circumstances. In short,
      I want you to assist me with a few hundreds."
    </p>
    <p>
      The proctor, after a pause, replied, "You place me in circumstances of
      great difficulty, sir; I am indeed anxious to oblige you, but I know not
      whether I can do so with honor, without violating my good faith to another
      party."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't understand you," said Turbot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I shall explain it," replied Purcel; "the sum I can command is one
      of four hundred, which is at this moment virtually lent upon excellent
      security, at an interest of eight per cent. The loan is certainly not
      legally completed, but morally and in point of honor it is. Now, if I lend
      this money to you, sir, I must break my word and verbal agreement to the
      party in question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, sir," replied the rector, who, notwithstanding the love he
      bore his "little luxuries," was scrupulously honorable in all money
      transactions, "don't attempt to break word, or to violate good faith with
      any man; and least of all, on my account. I presume I shall be able to
      raise the money somewhere else."
    </p>
    <p>
      Purcel, who had uniformly found the doctor a sharp, but correct man in
      matters,of business, and who knew besides the severe pressure under which
      he labored at the moment, was not exactly prepared to hear from him the
      expression of a principle so high-minded. He paused again for some time,
      during which he reasoned with himself somewhat to the following effect:&mdash;"I
      did not expect this from the worthy doctor, but I did, that he would at
      once have advised me to break the agreement I mentioned and lend himself
      the money. I cannot think there will be much risk in lending such a man a
      few hundreds, especially as no such agreement as I allude to exists." He
      then replied as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doctor," he proceeded, "I have been thinking over this matter; I know you
      want the money, and I am sorry for it. That I have myself been a gainer by
      my connection with you, I will not attempt to deny, and I do not think
      that I should be grateful or a sincere friend to you, if I saw you now in
      such grievous and unexpected embarrassments without making an effort to
      assist you. You shall have the four hundred, if you consent to the same
      rate of interest I was about to receive for it from the other party."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you will break faith with him," replied the doctor. "I thank you,
      Purcel, but I will not have it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I break no faith with him," replied the proctor; "he was bound to have
      let me know, on yesterday, whether he would require the money or not, for
      the matter was conditional; but as I have not yet heard from him, I hold
      myself at liberty to act as I wish. The fault is his own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And on these conditions, so you are; I well, thank you again, Purcel, I
      accept this money on your terms, eight per cent. Nay, you oblige me very
      much; indeed you do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, that matter is settled," said the proctor, "do not speak of
      it," he proceeded, in reply to the doctor's last observation; "I should
      indeed be unworthy either of your good opinion or my own, if I held aloof
      from you just now. I will have a bond prepared in a day or two, but in the
      meantime, if you will call at my house, you may have the money home with
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor once more thanked Mm, and they were in the act of returning to
      the house, when the noise of a pistol was heard, and at the same moment a
      bullet whistled light between them, and so close to each that it was
      utterly impossible to say at which of the two individuals the murderous
      aim had been taken. The garden, a large one and highly walled in, was
      entered by two gates, one of which led into the back yard, the other into
      a corner of the lawn that was concealed from the house by a clump of
      trees. The latter gate, which was not so large as the other, had in it a
      small iron grating a little above the centre, through which any one could
      command a view of the greater portion of the garden. It was through this
      gate they had entered, and as no apprehension of any attempt of
      assassination had existed in the mind of either, they left the key in the
      outside, not having deemed it at all necessary to secure the door, by
      locking it within.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proctor, to whose cowardice the worthy clergyman had not long before
      paid so sincere, but by no means so flattering a tribute, did not wait to
      make even a single observation, but ran with all his speed towards the
      gate, which, to his surprise and mortification, he found locked on the
      outside. Apprehensive, however, of a second attack, he beckoned to his
      companion to hasten towards the other gate, which was not visible from
      that through which the shot had been fired, and in the meantime, he
      himself ran also towards it, in order to try whether it might not be
      possible to get some view or trace of the assassin. He had a case of
      pistols in his hand, for we ought to have told the reader that neither he
      nor his sons ever traveled unarmed, and on reaching the back-yard, he was
      obliged to make a considerable circuit ere he arrived at the spot from
      which the shot had been fired. Here, however, he found no mark or vestige
      of a human being, but saw at a glance that the assassin, in order, to
      secure time for escape, had locked the door, and either taken the key with
      him or thrown it where it could not be found. It was in vain that he ran
      in all directions, searched every place likely to conceal the villain; not
      a clump of trees or ornamental shrubs remained unexamined. The search,
      however, was fruitless. No individual was seen, nor any clue gained on
      which even a conjecture could be founded. The only individual visible was
      our friend the <i>Cannie Soogah</i>, whose loud and mellow song was the
      first thing that drew their attention to him, as he came up a back avenue
      that led by a private and winding walk round to the kitchen-door. Purcel,
      on seeing him, signed hastily with his hand that he should approach, which
      the other, observing the unusual agitation betrayed by his gesture,
      immediately did at a pace considerably quickened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, Cannie," he shouted out to him, ere he had time to approach, "here
      has been an attempt at murder by some cold-blooded and cowardly assassin,
      who has, I fear, escaped us!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Murdher!" exclaimed the pedlar, "the Lord save and guard us!&mdash;for
      there's nothin' but murdher in my ears! go where I will of late, it's
      nothin' but bloodshed;&mdash;sure I cannot sing my harmless bit of a song
      along the road, but I'm stopped wid an account of some piece o' murdher or
      batthery, or God knows what. An' who was near gettin' it now, Misther
      Purcel? Not yourself, I pray Jasus this day!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really cannot say, Cannie; Dr. Turbot and I were walking in the garden,
      when some damnable villain discharged a pistol from the gate here, and the
      bullet of it whistled right between us both."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whistled, did it!&mdash;hell resave it for one bullet, it was fond of
      mirth it was; and you can't say which o' you it was whistling for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, how could I?&mdash;it was equally near us both."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bad cess for ever saize him for a murdherin' villain, whoever he was. You
      have no notion, Masther Purcel, darlin', where he went to?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not the slightest, Cannie; the villain wouldn't have got off so easily,
      only that he had the diabolical cunning to lock the gate outside and
      conceal the key: so that whilst I was coming round to the place, he
      escaped. Did you meet or see nobody yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The peddler shut his right hand, slapped it quickly into the palm of his
      left. "By the Lomenty tarry," he exclaimed, "I seen the villain! By the
      high horicks, I seen the very man, if I have an eye in my head! A big,
      able-bodied villain, wid a pair of thumpin' black whiskers that you might
      steal my own out of&mdash;and I don't think I can complain myself. He was
      comin' up the road from the Carr, and he was turnin' over towards the
      bridge there below, so that I only got a short glimpse of him; and faix,
      sure enough, as he passed the bridge, I seen him throw something over the
      wall of it into the river, which I'd lay my head against the three
      kingdoms was the kay o' the gate."
    </p>
    <p>
      The proctor paused a little, and then observed, "Ay, faith! I'm sure
      you're right, Cannie; I've heard of that villain, and know him from your
      description. He is the cowardly ruffian who's said to be at the head or
      bottom of these secret combinations that are disgracing and destroying the
      country. Yes, I've heard of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what did you hear, Misther Purcel?" asked the pedlar, with
      undisguised curiosity&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No matter now, Cannie; I haven't time to bestow upon the murdering
      ruffian: I have my eye on him, however, and so have others. Indeed, I'm
      rather inclined to think the hemp has already grown that will hang him.
      What dress had he on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, sir, he had on a whitish frieze coat, wid big brown buttons; but
      there could be no mistakin' the size of his murderin' red whiskers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Red whiskers!&mdash;why, you said a moment ago that they were black."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Black! hut tut, no, Misther Purcel, I couldn't say that; devil such a
      pair of red thumpers ever I seen, barin' upon Rousin' Redhead that was
      sent across&mdash;for&mdash;for&mdash;buildin' churches&mdash;ha! ha! ha!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I'd take my oath you said black," rejoined the proctor&mdash;"that
      is, if I have ears to my head."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Troth, an' you have Misther Purcel, as brave a pair as a man could boast
      of; but the truth is, you wor so much feflustered wid alarm, and got
      altogether so much through other, that you didn't know what I said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did perfectly: you said distinctly that he had black whiskers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Red, by the hokey, over the world; however, to avoid an argument, even if
      I did, in mistake, say black, the whiskers were red in the mane time; an',
      as I sed, barrin' Rousin' Redhead's, that was thransported, a never laid
      my eyes on so red, nor so big I pair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He can't be the fellow I suspect, then&mdash;for his, by all accounts,
      are unusually large and black."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to that, I can't say, sir: but you wouldn't have me give a wrong
      description of any villain that 'ud make an attempt upon your life. Are
      you sure, though, it wasn't his reverend honor that the pistol was aimed
      at?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not; as I told you, it is impossible to settle that point. There is
      neither of us very popular, certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bekaise, afther all, there is a difference; and it doesn't folly that,
      although I'd purshue the villain for life and death, that 'ud attempt to
      murdher you, that I'd distress myself to secure an honest man that might
      free us an' the country from the like o' him;" and he pointed over his
      left shoulder with his inverted thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cannie," said the proctor, somewhat sternly, "I've never heard you give
      expression to such sentiments before, and I hope I shall never again. No
      honest man would excuse or tamper with murder or murderers. No more of
      this, Cannie, or you will lose my good opinion, although perhaps you would
      think that no great loss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Throth, I know I was wrong to spake as I did, sir, bad cess to me, but I
      was, an' as for your good opinion, Misther Purcel, and the good of all
      your family too, devil a man livin' 'ud go further to gain it, and to keep
      it when he had it than I would; now, bad cess to the one."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst this dialogue was proceeding between the pedlar and the proctor.
      Dr. Turbot, in a state of indescribable alarm, was relating the attempted
      assassination to his curate inside. The amazement of the latter gentleman,
      who was perfectly aware of the turbulent state of the country, by no means
      kept pace with the alarm of his rector. He requested of the latter, that
      should he see Mrs. Temple, he would make no allusions to the circumstance,
      especially as she was at the period in question not far from her
      confinement, and it was impossible to say what unpleasant or dangerous
      effects an abrupt mention of so dreadful a circumstance might have upon
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes Purcel and his patron were on their way to Longshot
      Lodge, the residence of the proctor. At the solicitation of the parson,
      however, they avoided the direct line of road, and reached home by one
      that was much more circuitous, and as the latter thought also more safe.
      Here, after Waiting for the arrival of the mail coach, which he resolved
      to meet on its way to the metropolis, he partook of a lunch, which, even
      to his voluptuous palate, was one that he could not but admit to be
      excellent. He received four hundred pounds from the proctor, for which he
      merely gave him a note of hand, and in a short time was on his way to the
      metropolis.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.&mdash;Unexpected Generosity&mdash;A False Alarm.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At this period, notwithstanding the circumstances which we have just
      related&mdash;and they were severe enough&mdash;the distress of the
      Protestant clergy of Ireland was just only beginning to set in. It had
      not, as yet, however, assumed anything like that formidable shape in which
      it subsequently appeared. To any scourge so dreadful, no class in the
      educated and higher ranks of society had been, within the records of
      historical recollection, ever before subjected. Still, like a malignant
      malady, even its first symptoms were severe, and indicative of the
      sufferings by which, with such dreadful certainty, they were followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that day, and at the very moment when the mysterious attempt at
      assassination,which we have recorded, was made, Dr. Turbot's worthy
      curate, on returning home from the neighboring village of Lisnagola, was,
      notwithstanding great reluctance on his part, forced into the following
      conversation with his lovely but dejected wife:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charles," said she, fixing her large, tearful eyes upon him, with a look
      in which love, anxiety, and sorrow were all blended, "I fear you have not
      been successful in the village. Has Moloney refused us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only conditionally, my dear Maria&mdash;that is, until our account is
      paid up&mdash;but for the present, and perhaps for a little longer, we
      must deny ourselves these 'little luxuries,'" and he accompanied the words
      with a melancholy smile. "Tea and sugar and white bread are now beyond our
      reach, and we must be content with a simpler fare."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Temple, on looking at their children, could scarcely refrain from
      tears; but she knew her husband's patience and resignation, and felt that
      it was her duty to submit with humility to the dispensation of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You and I, my dear Charles, could bear up under anything&mdash;but these
      poor things, how will they do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That reflection is only natural, my dear Maria; but it is spoken,
      dearest, only like a parent, who probably loves too much and with an
      excess of tenderness. Just reflect, darling, upon the hundreds of
      thousands of children in our native land, who live healthily and happily
      without ever having tasted either tea or loaf-bread at all; and think,
      besides, dearest, that there are, in the higher circles, a great number of
      persons whose children are absolutely denied these comforts, by advice of
      their physicians. Our natural wants, my dear Maria, are but simple, and
      easily satisfied; it is wealth and luxury only that corrupt and vitiate
      them. In this case, then, dearest, the Christian must speak, and act, and
      feel as well as the parent. You understand me now, love, and that is
      sufficient. I have not succeeded in procuring anything for you or them,
      but you may rest assured that God will not desert us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear Charles," replied his wife, whose black mellow eyes beamed with
      joy; "all that is true, but you forgot that Dr. Turbot has arrived to
      receive his tithes, and you will now receive your stipend. That will carry
      us out of our present difficulty at least."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Maria, it is enough to say that Dr. Turbot is in a position
      immeasurably more distressed and dreadful than ours. Purcel, his proctor,
      has been able to receive only about fifty pounds out of his usual
      half-yearly income of eight hundred. From him we are to expect nothing at
      present. I know not, in fact, how he and his family will bear this
      dreadful privation; for dreadful it must be to those who have lived in the
      enjoyment of such luxuries."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is indeed dreadful to such a family, and I pity them from my heart,"
      replied his wife; "but, dearest,Charles, what are we to do?&mdash;except a
      small crust of bread, there is no food in the house for either them or
      you." As she uttered the words their eyes met, and his gentle and soothing
      Maria, who had been sitting beside him, threw herself upon his bosom&mdash;he
      clasped his arms around her&mdash;pressed her with melancholy affection to
      his heart, and they both wept together.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he added, "But you think not of yourself, my Maria."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I!" she replied; "ah! what am I? Anything, you know, will suffice for me&mdash;but
      you and they, my dearest Charles&mdash;and then poor Lilly, the servant;
      but, dearest," she exclaimed, with a fresh, and if possible, a more tender
      embrace, "I am not at all repining&mdash;I am happy with you&mdash;happy,
      happy&mdash;and never, never, did I regret the loss of my great and
      powerful friends less than I do at this moment, which enables me to see
      and appreciate the virtues and affection to which my heart is wedded, and
      which I long since appreciated."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband forced a smile, and kissed her with an air of cheerfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me," he said, "dearest Maria, for two or three minutes I wish to
      go to the library to make a memorandum. I will soon return."
    </p>
    <p>
      He then left her, after a tender embrace, and retired, as he said, to the
      library, where, smote to the heart by his admiration of her affection and
      greatness of mind, he sat down, and whilst he reflected on the destitution
      to which he had brought the granddaughter of an earl, he wept bitterly for
      several minutes. It was from this peculiar state of feeling that he was
      called upon to hear an account of the attempted assassination, with which
      the reader is already acquainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our friend, the Cannie Soogah, having taken the town of Lisnagola on his
      way, in order to effect some sales with one of those general country
      merchants on a somewhat small scale, that are to be found in almost every
      country town, happened to be sitting in a small back-parlor, when a
      certain conversation took place between Mr. Temple and Molony, the
      proprietor of the establishment to which we have just alluded. He heard
      the dialogue, we say, and saw that the mild and care-worn curate had been,
      not rudely certainly, but respectfully, yet firmly, refused further
      credit. By whatever spirit prompted it is not for us to say; at all events
      he directed his footsteps to the glebe, and&mdash;but it is unnecessary to
      continue the description, or rather to repeat it. The reader is already
      aware of what occurred until the departure of Dr. Turbot and the proctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple, having seen them depart, walked out for a little, in order to
      compose his mind, and frame, if possible, some project for the relief of
      his wife and children. In the meantime, our jolly pedlar, having caught a
      glimpse of Mrs. Temple at the parlor window, presented himself, and begged
      to know if she were inclined to make any purchases. She nodded him a
      gentle and ladylike refusal, upon which he changed his ground, and said,
      "Maybe, ma'am, if you're not disposed to buy, that you'd have something
      you'd like to part wid. If you have, ma'am, bad cess to the purtier
      purchaser you'd meet wid&mdash;shawls or trinkets, or anything that way&mdash;I
      mane, ma'am," he added, "things that arn't of any use to you&mdash;an' I'm
      the boy that will shell out the ready money, and over the value."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Temple had known little&mdash;indeed nothing&mdash;of the habits of
      such a class as that to which our gay friend belonged; but be this as it
      may, his last words struck her quickly and forcibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you make purchases, then?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do, ma'am, plaise your honor," replied the pedlar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop a moment, then," she replied. "I have some superfluous articles of
      dress that I may dispose of."
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole mother rushed into her heart at the thought; the tender and
      loving wife forgot everything but the means of obtaining food for her
      husband and children. She went to her dressing-room, and in a few minutes
      returned, accompanied by Lilly Stewart, her own servant-maid previous to
      ker marriage, to whom their recent distresses had been no secret, and who
      was deeply and deservedly in the confidence of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst she was, absent in her dressing-room the pedlar resumed his song,
      as was his custom when alone&mdash;a circumstance which caused Mrs. Temple
      to remark, as she and Lilly went down to, the parlor&mdash;"Alas! dear
      Lilly, what a mistaken estimate does one portion of mankind form of
      another. This poor pedlar now envies us the happiness of rank and wealth
      which we do not feel, and I&mdash;yes, even I&mdash;what would I not give
      to be able to carol so light-hearted a song as that which he is singing!
      Who is this man, Lilly, do you know him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, ma'am, if all they say is true, every one knows him, and nobody
      knows him. He's known as the <i>Cannie Soogah</i>, or jolly pedlar. They
      say, that although he prefers this kind of life, he's very wealthy. One
      person will tell you that he's a great rogue, and would cheat Satan
      himself, and others say he's generous and charitable. In other respects,"
      continued. Lilly, blushing, "he's not very well spoken of, but it may be
      false. I have always found him myself very civil; and them that spoke
      harshly of him were people that he kept at a distance."
    </p>
    <p>
      The pedlar ceased his song as soon as they made their appearance in the
      parlor, into which Lilly admitted him for the sake of mutual convenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's a shawl&mdash;a beautiful shawl, Mr. &mdash;&mdash; what's this
      your name is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The name that I have for set days and bonfire nights," he replied, "is
      one I seldom tell," and at the same time there was a dry air of surprise
      about him on hearing her ask the question; "but the name I am generally
      known by is the <i>Cannie Soogah</i>, which manes, ma'am," he added,
      addressing himself in a respectful manner to Mrs. Temple, "the jolly
      merchant or pedlar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Cannie," said Lilly, pronouncing the word with more familiarity
      than could have been expected from their apparent unaquaintance with each
      other, "here's a beautiful shawl that my mistress made me a present of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Lilly," said her mistress, with severity&mdash;for she neither could
      nor would sanction the falsehood, however delicately and well intended&mdash;"no,
      do not mislead the man, nor state anything but the truth. The shawl is
      mine, my good man, and I wish to dispose of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The pedlar looked at it, and replied, in a tone of disappointment, "Yes,
      ma'am, but I'm afeard it's beyant my manes; I know the value of it right
      well, and it's seldom ever the likes of it was in my pack. What are you
      axin', ma'am? it's as good as new."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it cost twelve or thirteen guineas, as well as I can remember,"
      she replied; "but it is not what it cost, but what you are now disposed to
      give for it, that I am anxious to know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, ma'am, you know I must look upon it as&mdash;hem&mdash;as a second&mdash;ha&mdash;at
      all events," he proceeded, checking himself with more delicacy than could
      be expected from him&mdash;"you must admit that it isn't new."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," said she, "it has been more than eight years in my
      possession, although, at the same time, I believe I have not worn it more
      than half a dozen times."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, ma'am," replied the pedlar, "I know the value of the shawl
      something betther even than yourself. If you will take six guineas for it,
      we will deal; more I cannot afford, for I must at once tell, you the
      truth, that I may carry it about these twelve months before I find any one
      that knows its value."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Temple was by no means prepared, any more than her servant, for such
      a liberal offer; and without any further hesitation she accepted it, and
      desired Lilly to place the shawl in his hands, and in the meantime, with
      equal consideration and good feeling, he handed Lilly six guineas, adding,
      "Give that to your mistress, but in troth, ma'am," he proceeded,
      respectfully addressing her; "it is just robbing you I am, but I can only
      say, that if I dispose of it at its proper-value you'll hear from me
      again. Troth, if I wasn't a great rogue, ma'am, I'd give you more for it;
      but bad cess to the one o' me&mdash;ever could be honest, even if I wasped
      for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not think you dishonest, my good, man," replied Mrs. Temple; "on the
      contrary, I am not displeased with your, plain blunt manner. Lilly give
      him some&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She checked herself at once, and passed, a significant but sorrowful
      glance at Lilly; as she went up to the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had no sooner gone, than the peddler, with a shrug of satisfaction,
      exclaimed, in a subdued but triumphant voice: "Oh! by the hokey I've done
      her, and for that you must suffer, Lilly darlin'. Come now, you jumpin'
      jewel you, that was born wid a honey-comb somewhere between, that purty
      chin and beautiful nose of yours&mdash;throth it must have a taste, for
      who the dickens could, refuse the <i>Cannie Soogah</i>, and before Lilly,
      who, by the way, was nothing, loath, could put herself in an attitude of
      defense, he had inflicted several smacks upon as pretty a pair of lips as
      ever were pressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my word; now, Mr. Magrath, you're very impudent," she replied, "I
      wonder you're not ashamed, you great strong man you, to be kissing girls
      in this manner, whether they will or not. Look at the state you have my
      hair in; you're very rude, Mr. Magrath, and I'm really angry with you;
      you've broken one of my side-combs, too; you're a great rude man, so you
      are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Broke your side-comb, did I? Well, then, you couldn't be in better hands,
      darlin', here's a pair I make you a present of, and maybe they won't set
      you all off to pieces; here, darlin', wear these for my sake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But are you making me a present of these beauties, Cannie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Troth an' I am, Lilly darlin', and wish they were betther for your sake&mdash;what's
      that I said? a present! oh the sorrow bit, I must have my payment&mdash;aisy
      now, darlin', my own sweet Lilly; there now, we're clear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my word, Mr. Magrath, I don't know what to say to you, but you're
      such a great strong fellow, that a poor weak girl like me is but a child
      in your arms; are these real tortoise-shell though?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may swear it; do you think I'd offer you anything else? But now
      listen, my darlin' girl, take this shawl, it's 'worth five-and-twenty
      guineas at least, troth, poor thing! it wasn't since their marriage it was
      bought; take it, I say, and go up widout sayin' a word, and lay it just
      where it was before, and if she seems surprised on findin' it there, tell
      her you suppose I forgot it, or if she won't believe you, and that all
      fails you, say that the <i>Cannie Soogah</i>, although she knows nothing
      about him, is a man that's undher great obligations to her family, and
      that he only tuck that method of payin' back a debt to her that he
      honestly owed to them, for, afther all, isn't she one of them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lilly shook her head, and her eyes filled with tears, at the manly and
      modest generosity of the pedlar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Little you know then, Mr. Magrath, the load you have taken off my dear
      mistress's heart, and the delight you have brought upon the whole family."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Lilly dear, sure if I did, amn't I well paid, for it? thanks to
      your two sweet lips for that. Sure, bad cess to me, but it was on your
      account I did it."
    </p>
    <p>
      A vile grin, or rather an awkward blank smile, forced by an affectation of
      gallantry, accompanied the lie which he uttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, indeed," replied Lilly, "on my 'account, don't think to pass
      that upon me; however, I can forgive you a great many things in
      consequence of your behavior&mdash;just now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet you abused me for it," he replied, laughing, "but sure I knew
      that a purty girl always likes to be kissed; bad cess to me, but the same
      behavior comes naturally to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go now," said Lilly, with a comic and peremptory manner; "go your rounds,
      I say; you know very well that I mane your behavior about the shawl, and
      not your great strong impudence."
    </p>
    <p>
      The pedlar, after winking and nodding meanings into her words that she had
      never thought of, slung his pack over his shoulder as usual, and proceeded
      on his rounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have always been of opinion that there is scarcely anything more
      mysterious than the speed with which popular report travels apparently
      with very inadequate machinery throughout a large district of country.
      Before the day was more than half-advanced, fame had succeeded in
      circulating a report that Matthew Purcel and Dr. Turbot had been both shot
      dead in the garden of the rectory. This report spread rapidly, and it is
      with equal pain and shame we are obliged to confess that in general it was
      received with evident and undisguised satisfaction. John and Alick Purcel,
      on their way home, were accosted at a place called "Murderer's Corner," by
      two of the men who had attended at their father's office that morning, and
      informed that he and Dr. Turbot had been murdered in the course of the
      day, a piece of information which was conveyed by them with a sneer of
      cowardly triumph that was perfectly diabolical.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God save ye, gintlemen!" said one of them, with a peculiar emphasis on
      the last word; "did ye here the news?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Jemmy, what is it?" asked John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, that Darby Hourigan is very ill," he replied, with mock gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No thanks for your information, Jemmy," replied the other; "if you told
      us something of more interest we might thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind him, gintlemen," replied his companion, "there's nothing wrong
      wid Darby Horaigan, barrin' that he occasionally rubs himself where he's
      not itching, but there's worse news than that before you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, then?" asked Alick; "if you know it, let us hear it, and
      don't stand humming and hawing as if you were afraid to speak."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith, an' it's no wondher I would, sir, when it's to tell you that
      you'll find your father a murdhered corpse at home before you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great God! what do you mean, sir? asked John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, gintlemen, it seems that himself an' Parson Turbot wor both shot in
      the parsonage garden to-day. The parson's takin' his rest in his own
      house, but your father's body was brought home upon the car. The bullet
      entered your worthy father's breeches' pocket, cut through a sheaf of
      notes that he had to pay the parson his tides wid, and from that it went
      on&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Human patience could not endure the ill-suppressed and heartless
      satisfaction with which the fellow was about to enter into the details,
      and accordingly, ere he had time to proceed further, John Purcel turning a
      hunting-whip, loaded for self-defense, left him sprawling on the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, you ill-conditioned scoundrel," he exclaimed, "whether he is
      murdered or not, take that for your information. Alick, lay on Hacket
      there, you are the nearest to him," he added, addressing his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hacket at once took to his heels, but the other, touching his horse with
      the spurs, cantered up to him, and brought the double thong of his whip
      into severe contact with his neck and shoulders. When this was over, the
      two fiery young men exclaimed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, now, are our thanks, not merely for your information, but for the
      good will with which it was given, and that to the very sons of the man
      whom, by your own account, you have murdered among you. If his blood
      however, has been shed, there is not a drop of it for which we will not
      exact a tenfold retribution."
    </p>
    <p>
      They then dashed home, at the highest speed of which their horses were
      capable, and throwing themselves out of the saddle, rushed to the
      hall-door, where they knocked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is my father at home, Letty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir, he's in the parlor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the parlor," exclaimed Alick, looking keenly into her face; "what is
      he doing in the parlor, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, he's readin' a letther, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reading a letter, is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank God!" exclaimed both the young men, breathing freely; "that will
      do, Letty&mdash;here, Letty, is half-a-crown for you to buy a ribbon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And another from me, Letty, to buy anything you fancy."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl looked at them with surprise, and for a moment or two seemed at a
      loss how to account for such evident excitement. At length she exclaimed:
      "By dad, I have it; you won the hunt, gintlemen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better than that, Letty," they replied, nodding, and immediately entering
      the parlor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, boys," said the father, "a good day's sport?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Capital, father! are you long home!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since about two o'clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did you come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, boys, ye must know that either Dr. Turbot or I was fired at to-day.
      A bullet&mdash;a pistol bullet&mdash;whistled right between us in the
      parsonage garden, and the poor frightened doctor refused to come by the
      usual way, and, in consequence, I was obliged to take the lower road."
    </p>
    <p>
      He then entered into a more detailed account of the attempted
      assassination, and heard from them, in reply, a history of their
      intelligence and adventure at Murderer's Corner with Hacket and Bryan, for
      so the fellows were named.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said the proctor, "thank God, things are not so bad as they
      report, after all; but, in the meantime, the plot appears to be thickening&mdash;here's
      more comfort," he added, handing him the notice which Mogue told him he
      had found upon the steps of the hall-doer, where, certainly, he had
      himself left it. John took the document and read as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "TO PROCTOR PURCEL AND HIS HORSE-WHIPPIN' SONS.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is to give you notice, that nothing can save yez. Look back upon
      your work an' see what yez desarve from the counthry. You began with a
      farm of sixty acres, and you took farm afther farm over the heads of the
      poor an' them that wor strugglin', until you now have six hundre' acres in
      your clutches. You made use of the strong purse against the wake man; an'
      if any one ventured to complain, he was sure to come in for a dose of the
      horsewhip from your tyrannical sons, or a dose of law from yourself. Now
      all that I've mentioned might be overlooked an' forgiven, for the sake of
      your wife and daughters, but it is for your conduct as a Tithe Proctor
      that you and your sons must die. Don't think to escape me, for it can't be
      done. There is not a day in the week, nor an hour in the day, but I have
      you at my command. Be prepared, then, for your fate is sealed; and no
      earthly power can save you. There is the sign [three coffins] and the
      blood that marks my name is from my own veins. You and your sons must die.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Captain Terror,
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Millstone-breaker."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tut," said Alick, "we have received far worse than this; it has been
      written by some hedge schoolmaster; as for my part, I despise it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, boys, at all events," proceeded the proctor, "be a little more
      sparing with the horse-whip. The scoundrels deserve it to be sure; but at
      the same time it is not a thing that can be defended."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, it's impossible to keep it from them, father," replied John; "their
      insolence is actually more than flesh and blood can bear. But had we not
      better make some inquiries into this precious production?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is the use of that?" said his father, to whom such communications
      had lost all their novelty and much of their interest; "however, you may
      do so; perhaps some accidental clue may be found that would lead us to
      discover the villain who wrote it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mogue was accordingly called in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did this letter come into your hands, Mogue?" asked the proctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It didn't come into them, sir," replied Mogue, with a smile which he
      intended to pass, for one of simplicity; "it was lyin' I got it, upon the
      hall-door steps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you see any strange person about the place, or near the hall-door
      to-day?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "None, sir, sorra a creature&mdash;well now, wait&mdash;that I may never
      sup sorrow, but I did&mdash;there was a poor woman, sir, wid a whack of a
      son along wid her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you see her near the steps?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I may be happy, sir, if I could take it upon me to say&mdash;not
      wishin' to tell a lie&mdash;but she might a' been there, the crathur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What kind of a looking woman was she?" asked John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A poor woman, sir, as I said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not mean that; of course, I know she was; but what dress had she on,
      and what kind of features or complexion had she? Was she big or little?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm just thinkin'," replied Mogue, seemingly attempting to recollect
      something, "was it to-day or yesterday I seen her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, but answer directly," said Alick, "what was she like?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The son of her was a bullet-headed <i>ownsha</i>," replied Mogue, "and
      herself&mdash;well now, that I may never die in sin, if I could say
      rightly. I was fetehin' some oats to Gimlet Eye, an' didn't take any
      particular notice. The <i>ownsha</i> had black sooty hair, cut short, an'
      walked as if his feet were sore&mdash;and indeed it strikes me that he had
      kibes&mdash;for these poor people isn't overly clane, an' don't wash their
      feet goin' to bed at night, barrin' at Christmas or Easther, the crathurs.
      But, sure the Lord look down on them, they have enough to do to live at
      all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You couldn't say what direction she came from?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, no."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor the direction she went by?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, no sir, I could not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But are you certain it was to-day, and not yesterday, you saw her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then that's what's puzzlin' me&mdash;eh! let me see&mdash;ay&mdash;it was
      to-day&mdash;an' I'll tell you how I know it. Bekaise it was to-day I
      brought the oats to Gimlet Eye&mdash;you know he was harrowing the black
      park yestherday and was in care of Paudeen Sthuccaun. But sure, sir, maybe
      somebody else about the place seen them."
    </p>
    <p>
      An investigation was consequently held upon this reasonable suggestion,
      but we need scarcely assure our readers, without effect; the aforesaid
      "poor woman" having had existence only in the fertile imagination of
      stainless and uncorrupted saint Mogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter had scarcely retired, when a gentle knock came to the door, and
      Alick, on opening it himself, found their friend and neighbor, Darby
      Hourigan, standing outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Hourigan, what do you want now? have you repented, and come to the
      resolution of paying your tithes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Darby gave no direct answer, nor indeed any answer at all to these
      questions, but simply said, "There's a bit o' paper, sir, for Misther
      John."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is this? Oh, oh, a summons!&mdash;very well, Mr. Hourigan, my
      brother will attend to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is where John Purcel lives, sir?" proceeded the man, according to
      some form which he supposed necessary to give effect and reality to the
      service; "you acknowledge that, sir, do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Live here!&mdash;why, you scoundrel, don't you know he does? Where else
      did he ever live?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, but you are only answerin' one question by another," replied
      Hourigan; "and I'll sarve you wid another to-morrow if you don't speak the
      truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "John," shouted his brother, "you're wanted. Here is your old friend
      Hourigan, anxious to get another&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&mdash;he is off like a
      shot!" he proceeded, addressing his brother, as the latter entered the
      hall; "but in the meantime," he added, handing him the summons, "this
      document is intended for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," observed John, laughing, "unless our friend O'Driscol is somewhat
      change"! I need not much fear Mr. Hourigan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is changed," observed the proctor; "the fellow is beginning to run
      with the hare and hunt with the hounds. If you wish to secure his favor,
      however, you ought to try and put him on the trail of a Conspiracy, or
      anything that will give him a tolerable justification for writing to his
      Friend the Castle, as he calls it! He is a regular conspiracy hunter, and
      were it not that he is now awfully afraid of these Whiteboys, and
      naturally cowardly and easily frightened, I think he would be the plague
      of government as well as the country."
    </p>
    <p>
      It would indeed, be extremely difficult to find a family so resolute and
      full of natural courage, and consequently so incapable of intimidation, as
      that of our friend the proctor. And what was equally striking, the female
      portion of them were as free from the weakness and timidity of their sex,
      in this respect, as the males.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.&mdash;A Shoneen Magistrate Distributing Justice.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the morning but one afterwards, John Purcel proceeded to the house of
      his friend and neighbor, Fitzy O'Driscol, as he was usually termed for
      brevity. O'Driscol was rather a small man&mdash;that is to say, he was
      short but thick, and of full habit. He was naturally well made, and had
      been considered well-looking, until his complexion became a good deal
      inflamed from the effects of social indulgence, to which he was rather
      strongly addicted. His natural manner would have been plausible if he had
      allowed it to remain natural; but so far from this, he affected an air of
      pomp and dignity, that savored very strongly of the mock heroic. On the
      other side, his clothes fitted him very well, and as he had a good leg and
      a neat small foot, he availed himself of every possible opportunity to
      show them. He was, like most men of weak minds, exceedingly fond of
      ornaments, on which account he had his fingers loaded with costly rings,
      and at least two or three folds of a large gold chain hung about his
      breast. His morning gown was quite a tasteful, and even an expensive
      article, and his slippers, heavily embroidered, harmonized admirably with
      the whole fashionable deshabille in which he often distributed justice. He
      carried a gold snuff-box of very massive size, which, when dining out, he
      always produced after dinner for the benefit of the company, although he
      never took snuff himself. This, in addition to a tolerably stiff and
      unreclaimable brogue, and a style of pronunciation wofully out of keeping
      with his elegant undress, constituted him the very beau-ideal of what is
      usually known as a <i>shoneen</i> magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      John, on arriving, found him reading a paper in the breakfast-parlor, and
      saw Hourigan waiting outside, who, by the way, gave him such a look as a
      cat might be supposed to bestow upon a mastiff from whom she dreaded an
      attack&mdash;a look which, in Hourigan's case, combined as much ferocious
      vengeance and sullen hang-dog cowardice as could well be brought together
      on the same features.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Jack," said the pompous distributor of justice, addressing young
      Purcel, "how do you do? Take a seat&mdash;by the way, is it true that your
      father and my excellent friend, Dr. Turbot, were shot at yesterday?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "True enough," replied John; "the bullet whistled right between them, and
      so close that each felt the wind of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The country is getting into a frightful state, friend Purcel, eh? Upon my
      honor now, yes! it is so&mdash;it is so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why there is no question of it," replied John; "it is already in a
      frightful state."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is, Mr. Purcel, and in my opinion, the <i>crame</i> of the matter will
      be blood&mdash;blood&mdash;my dear John&mdash;that is what it will come
      to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly you speak, Mr. O'Driscol, like a man that knows the country,
      and can feel the pulse of the public officially&mdash;I mean, of course,
      as a magistrate&mdash;for it is now, and in times of such turbulence, that
      men&mdash;I mean magistrates&mdash;of your stamp&mdash;will prove
      themselves serviceable to the government of the country, and to the
      country itself; intelligent and determined men&mdash;I mean magistrates&mdash;who
      know not what fear is, and who will do their duty at the risk of their
      lives."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True, John, it is such men, or rather magistrates, who can render the
      most important services to government. The duties of a loyal and attached
      magistrate are not a mere raycrayation during these times. And yet, John,"
      he added, sinking his voice into a confidential whisper, "I protest to my
      honor that the life of a man&mdash;I mane, as you say, a magistrate&mdash;who
      resolves firmly to perform his duty, is not extramely safe; why then
      should a man&mdash;I mane a magistrate&mdash;unnecessarily expose himself
      to the fate of Going,* when he might much more safely remain snug and
      quiet, without putting either himself or his neighbors to inconvanience by
      an over-strict discharge of his duty?"
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [* The name of a magistrate and clergyman, I think, who was
     assassinated.]
</pre>
    <p>
      "If everything be true that I have heard," said John, "the government
      would scarcely expect to hear such sentiments from the intelligent and
      determined Mr. O'Driscol."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha! ha! ha!&mdash;well done, John,&mdash;I drew you out. Upon my honor, I
      am glad to find that you are loyal, at all events, and that is a rare
      virtue among most persons of your creed;&mdash;excuse me, but, except in
      name, I can scarcely consider you as belonging to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, sir," replied John, "I trust I am a firm, but not a bigoted
      Catholic."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Roman Catholic, John, always say, if you plaise; we claim to be the true
      Catholics you know; and for that raison it is better always to avoid
      confusion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to that, we shall not quarrel about it, I trust," replied Purcel; "but
      with respect to another point, there is only one opinion, Mr. O'Driscol,
      and that is, that you are a most resolute and determined man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Magistrate you mane, I think, John; so magistrate, if you plaise&mdash;ha!
      ha!' ha! By the way will you touch the bell? Thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon," proceeded Purcel, having touched the bell, "I should
      have said magistrate: because it very often happens that whilst the man is
      a coward, the magistrate is as brave as the Duke of Wellington."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my honor and conscience, there may be some truth in that," said
      O'Driscol, nodding, but at the same time not exactly appropriating the
      category to himself; "but how do you make that appear, John?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," replied Purcel, who, between ourselves, was a bit of a wag in his
      way, "it proceeds from the spirit of his office. Take a magistrate, for
      instance, as a man&mdash;a mere man; place him in the ordinary situations
      of society; let him ride home at night, for instance, through a disturbed
      district like this, which, if he is wise, he will avoid doing, or let him
      be seen in an isolated position even in daylight without protection, and
      you will find him a coward of the first shaking. On the contrary, place
      him, as a magistrate, at the head of a body of police or military, and
      where will you witness such courage? That, then, is the individual, I say,
      who being naturally a coward as a man, goes through his duty with courage
      as a magistrate; I say this is the individual whom the government should
      reward with especial favor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the way, will you touch that bell again?&mdash;oh, here he comes.
      Sam," he said, addressing a servant, "get me up a bottle of soda-wather.
      Will you have a glass of soda, John? I dipped a little too deep last
      night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir, thank you," replied Purcel, "I was moderate last night; and at
      all events soda is rather cold for such a day as this is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then can't you stiffen it with a little brandy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, thank you, I won't touch anything at present. I almost wish, as I was
      saying," he proceeded, "that there was the slightest touch of cowardice in
      you, naturally; because if it could be proved in connection with your
      official intrepidity, you would deserve everything that a government could
      bestow upon you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith and honor, that is certainly putting the argument in an extremely
      new point of view, and I agree with you, John; that is&mdash;that&mdash;let
      me see&mdash;the more cowardly the man the braver the magistrate. Well, I
      don't know that aither."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no!" replied John, "I don't mean that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what do you mane? for I thought I undherstood you a while ago,
      although find that I don't now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean," proceeded the other, "that when a man who is naturally cowardly&mdash;I
      don't mean, of course, a poltroon, but timid&mdash;proves himself to be
      firm, resolute, and intrepid in the discharge of his duties as a
      magistrate, such a man deserves a civic crown."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A civic crown. Of course you know what that is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of coorse I do, John; and upon my honor and conscience there is great
      truth in what you say. I could name you a magistrate who, I believe, as a
      magistrate, could not very aisily be bate, and yet who, without being a
      downright coward, is for all that no hairo to his valley de sham, as they
      say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father was talking about you last night, sir, and I think before long
      he will be able to put you on the scent of as pretty a conspiracy as was
      ever detected. He had some notion of opening a communication with
      government himself upon the subject; but I suggested&mdash;that is, I took
      the liberty, sir, if you will excuse me, but if I erred I assure you Mr.
      O'Driscol, my intentions were good&mdash;I say I took the liberty, sir, of
      suggesting that it would be better to place the matter in your hands, as a
      person possessing more influence with your friend, the Castle, and more
      conversant with the management of a matter that is too important to be in
      any but official hands. I have time at the preset only to allude to it,
      for I see Mr. Darby Hourigan there waiting to prosecute, or as he says to
      take the law of, your humble servant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hang the scoundrel, what a hurry he is in! How did you quarrel with him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith, sir, in the first place, he was insolent and offensive beyond all
      patience."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear John," observed O'Driscol, with a good deal of solemn pomp,
      especially as the magistrate was beginning to supersede the man, "all that
      is very provoking, but at the same time you know the horsewhip is an
      illaygal instrument."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon, sir," replied Purcel, with a smile, "I believe not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mane, John," said the other, "an improper use of it is. You should be
      more cautious, John, in using it, for the punishment of any animal barring
      a horse. I have heard, by the way, many complaints against you on that
      head."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir, but you are not aware that it is from a principle of humanity I
      horsewhip the scoundrels."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is that now, John? for upon my honor and conscience I can't for the
      life of me persave any great humanity in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, sir," replied Purcel, who, as the reader must be aware, was
      humbugging the worthy magistrate all the time, "I appeal to yourself
      whether it is not better for any one of these rascals to get a
      horsewhipping from me than a citation to the Bishop's Court from my
      father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, but do they never happen to get both, John?" returned the magistrate.
      "But what has a horsewhipping and a citaytion to the Bishop's Court to do
      with aich other?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Simply this," replied the other, "that when my father hears I horsewhip
      any of them, he takes no further proceedings against them; and whenever I
      wish, consequently, to keep a fellow out of that troublesome situation, I
      horsewhip him from pure kindness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that you look upon that as a good turn to them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely, sir. As I said, I horsewhip them from motives of humanity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith and don't be surprised, John, if they should happen to put a bullet
      through you from motives of humanity some of these days. However, do you
      think it is of importance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is what, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The conspiracy. I beg your pardon&mdash;come into the office till I see
      what I can do for you at all events."
    </p>
    <p>
      He accordingly preceded Purcel to his office, accompanied by Sam Finigan,
      a kind of thorough male domestic who acted as his clerk. Here he took his
      seat with a good deal of ceremony, hemmed several times, and desired
      Hourigan to be admitted. Just at that moment, and while Hourigan was
      coming in, a young lad, or tiger, a son of Finigan's, by the way, who had
      been in the habit of carrying letters to and from the neighboring
      post-office, now entered and presented him with one, to the following
      effect:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "TO O'DRISKAL, THE SHONEEN MAGISTRIDGE.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sur this is to let you no that if you go an givin wan la for the poor and
      anud'her for the rich you will soon get a bullet through you as Tandrem af
      Tavnibeg got. If you wish to bay safe thin bay the poor man's friend&mdash;oderways
      it'll be worse for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kaptn Jostige."
    </p>
    <p>
      O'Driscol having read this communication, became desperately disturbed for
      about a couple of minutes, after which, as if struck by some sudden
      thought, he appeared to recover himself considerably, but by no means
      fully, as was evident from the agitation of his voice and the involuntary
      tremor of his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope, sir," said Purcel, who could not help observing the commotion
      into which the notice had put him, "that you have received no ill tidings.
      You seem agitated and alarmed, or rather distressed, if one can judge; I
      hope there's nothing wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, no," replied the magistrate, "not exactly wrong; but it is certainly
      an infamous country to live in. I am an impartial man, Mr. Purcel&mdash;I
      mane, sir, an impartial magistrate; but the fact is, sir, that every man
      is marked whose life is valuable to the government of his country. I know
      no man, Mr. Purcel&mdash;mark me you, too, Hourigan&mdash;I know no man,
      sir, in my capacity of a magistrate&mdash;hem&mdash;hem!&mdash;only
      according to the merits&mdash;I am as much the poor man's friend as I am
      the rich man's, and of the two more: if I lane at all, which I don't, it
      is to the poor man; but as an impartial man&mdash;magistrate I mane&mdash;I
      know naither rich or poor. On the bench, I say, I know naither poverty nor
      riches, barring, as I said, upon the merits."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beggin' your pardon, your worship&mdash;an' before you begin&mdash;as I
      was comin' down here a while agone," said Hourigan, "I seen a strange and
      suspicious-lookin' man inside the hedge at the shrubbery below; he was an
      ill-faced villain, plaise your reverence, an' I thought I seen his pockets
      stickin' out as if he had pistols in them. I thought it better to tell
      your worship."
    </p>
    <p>
      The worthy magistrate had scarcely recovered from the first fit of
      agitation when this intelligence threw him into an immediate relapse.
      Indeed so ludicrous was his distress that he actually wiped the
      perspiration from his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sam," said he, after a fit of tremulous coughing, into which he forced
      himself, in order to conceal the quaver which terror had given to his
      voice, "Sa&mdash;am&mdash;hugh! ugh!&mdash;go-o&mdash;an-n-d&mdash;ugh!
      ugh! ugh!&mdash;get a ca-a-se of doub-uble pis-pistols&mdash;ugh! ugh!&mdash;da&mdash;amn
      this cough&mdash;ough&mdash;and place&mdash;them-em on the table here&mdash;we&mdash;we&mdash;will
      at least pep-pepper the villain&mdash;if&mdash;if&mdash;he&mdash;he should
      dare to show his face&mdash;-ace. I trust I&mdash;I&mdash;know my duties
      as&mdash;a mag-istrate&mdash;my cour&mdash;urage and in-trep&mdash;id&mdash;ity
      as such&mdash;ugh! ijg'h! ugh!&mdash;are no saycret now, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe," observed Purcel, "that there is one syllable of truth
      in what he says. I can read the falsehood in his eye. However," he added,
      "if you will postpone this matter of Hourigan's for a few minutes, I shall
      soon see whether there is any one there or not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, then," said the magistrate, "take these pistols" (pointing to those
      which Finigan had just laid on the table). Purcel declined them with a
      nod, taking a good case at the same time out of his own pocket. "No, sir,
      thank you, I never travel without my two friends here, with either of
      which I can break a bottle at the distance of thirty yards. You will be
      good enough to tell that to your friends, Mr. Hourigan, and also to
      reflect upon it yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Having examined his friends, as he called them, he started out and
      proceeded directly towards the shrubbery, where, however, there was no
      trace whatever of any one. On his way home he met Fergus O'Driscol, who
      had been out that morning cock-shooting through the grounds, and to whom
      he mentioned the story told by Hourigan. "Why, the lying scoundrel,"
      exclaimed Fergus, "I saw him myself speaking to a new laboring lad whom
      Mr. Arthur, the steward, sent in there this morning to gather and remove
      the rotten underwood. He has only vamped up this story to frighten my
      heroic father, and between you and me it is not difficult to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dare say you are right, Fergus, but between you and me again, who is
      this new-comer you mention? for you may rest assured that if he be very
      intimate with Darby Hourigan, you had as good keep an eye upon him. Darby
      is one of the good ones."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't even know his name yet," replied Fergus, "but if we are to judge
      by appearances, he is somewhat of Darby's kidney, for a worse-looking
      young vagabond I have seldom laid my eyes upon. At all events I know
      Hourigan's story to be a lie, for as he came up the avenue I was in the
      shrubbery, looking for a cock I shot, which dropped among the hollies, and
      there was certainly nobody there but this strange fellow and Hourigan,
      both of whom chatted to each other for some minutes across the hedge; and,
      by the way, I now remember that they kept watching about them
      suspiciously, as if they did not wish to be seen speaking together. The
      fact, now that you have mentioned the case, is evident; I could not be
      deceived in this matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well then," said Purcel, "I will tell you how we shall bring that
      circumstance to a test: get the strange fellow to walk my horse up and
      down the avenue, so as that he must necessarily come in Hourigan's way,
      and if they refuse to speak in my presence you may accompany me down the
      avenue if you wish&mdash;we may take it for granted that there is an
      understanding between them and on this account we will say nothing on our
      return, but that we failed to see or trace any one, which will be the
      truth, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst this conversation took place between the two young men, our worthy
      magistrate, now that he had an opportunity of recruiting his courage,
      withdrew for a moment, accompanied by his servant and clerk, Sam Finigan.
      "Sam," said he, in undisguised trepidation, "my life's not worth a week's
      purchase."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was a threatening letter you received, sir?" said Sam, inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The same, Sam. Upon my honor and conscience, they have threatened me with
      the fate of Tandrem of Tavnibeg, who got five bullets into him, not fifty
      yards from his own door. Get me the brandy then quick, and another bottle
      of soda-wather. Good Lord! Sam, see what it is to be an active and
      determined magistrate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Sam, after he had placed the brandy and soda-water before
      him, "it's one comfort, plaise your honor, that if they shoot your
      worship, government will take a glorious revenge upon them. The three
      kingdoms will hear of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, but, Sam&mdash;good Lord!&mdash;here's God grant us a long life in
      the manetime! but upon my honor and conscience it's not revenge upon my
      own murdherers I want, but to be made a Stipendiary. Revenge! Good Lord!
      what is revenge to a murdhered man, Sam, maybe with five bullets in him!
      Now, Sam, this is not want of courage in me&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;mere
      distress of mind on looking at the state of the country. A
      suspicious-looking villain to be lurking in my own shrubbery, with the
      very pistols sticking out of his pocket! Good Lord! I believe I'll take
      another half-glass, Sam; I think I feel somewhat more intrepid&mdash;more
      relieved. Yes, pour me out another half-glass, or a whole one, as your
      hand is in, Sam, and take another for yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank your worship," said Sam, who never called him anything else when
      exercising, or about to exercise his functions as a magistrate, "here's
      the same, your worship&mdash;God grant us both&mdash;your worship at any
      rate&mdash;a long life!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a happy death, Sam; there is no harm to add that to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a happy death, your worship!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Sam, here's the same! And now I think in a few minutes my natural
      courage will return; for indeed I'm too kind-hearted, Sam, and too aisily
      made feel, as you persave, for the traisonable state of the country, and
      of the misguided people. However, I only feel these things as a man, Sam,
      as a kind-hearted man, but not as a fearless and resolute magistrate, Sam:
      as a magistrate I don't know what fear is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's well known, your worship; when you're at the head of a body of
      polis or military, every one knows what you are; isn't dare-devil Driscol,
      your worship, the best name they have for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "True enough, Sam; d&mdash;n them; a man, especially a magistrate,
      couldn't be courageous unknown to them&mdash;they'll be sure to find it
      out. I'm a good deal relieved, Sam, and&mdash;hem&mdash;hem&mdash;let us
      proceed to investigate this important matter of Hourigan's. These Purcels
      are&mdash;hem&mdash;ahem&mdash;too much in the habit of violating the law,
      Sam, and that's not right&mdash;it's illaygal&mdash;it's illay-gal, Sam,
      to violate the law; I say so, and I think I can't allow such breaches of
      the"&mdash;here, however, the thought of the conspiracy occurred, and
      swayed him in a moment against Hourigan. "To be sure Hourigan's a
      scoundrel, and deserves a horsewhipping every day he rises."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True enough, sir; and sure if the Purcels break the law, it is only upon
      the people, and arn't the people, your worship, as ready to break the law
      as the Purcels! Sorra warrant, then, I'd grant against Misther John this
      bout."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what would you do, Sam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd bind Hourigan over to keep the pace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe you're right, Sam; he's a bad bird, Hourigan; so I think the
      best thing to do is to tie his hands up for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if we could tie his tongue up too, your worship, it ought to be
      done."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, on the other hand, the notice he had just received stuck in his
      throat, and reduced him to a new perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But then, Sam," he added, "think of the revengeful spirit that is abroad.
      Good Lord! it is awful! Haven't I this moment a threatening notice on my
      table? Well," he added, "if ever a man suffered in the cause of government
      as a public man and an active resolute magistrate, I do; indeed, Sam, if I
      had known the cares, and troubles, and responsibilities of my official
      situation, I am not certain whether I would not have preferred a private
      station; but you see government will find out men of talent and public
      spirit. If I had less of either, it isn't threatening letters I'd be
      resaving this day. Come, then, let us go to the discharge of our duty,
      Sam, fearlessly and impartially, as a man entrusted with great public
      authority."
    </p>
    <p>
      He accordingly proceeded to the office, a good deal recruited in courage
      by the brandy, but by no means altogether relieved from the apprehensions
      consequent upon the receipt of the notice and Hourigan's narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fergus and Purcel, on their way from the shrubbery to the house, fell upon
      a simpler plan by which to detect Hourigan's falsehood, and ascertain
      whether there existed any personal acquaintance or understanding of any
      sort between him and the new-comer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, John," said O'Driscol, after once more placing himself with his
      usual pomp in his magisterial chair, "have you been able to find any
      account or trace of the assassin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None whatever, sir," replied Purcel; "neither tale nor tidings of him
      could I find."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When did you see him, Hourigan?" asked Fergus; "was it on your way here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the avenue?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the avenue, sir, about fifty yards inside the hedge, jist opposite the
      hollies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you not speak to him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Troth, sir, he had too suspicious a look; for how did I know but it's a
      bullet I'd get into, me, if I was only seen obsarvin' or watchin' him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you did not speak to him?" asked Fergus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith, you may swear that, sir; that is not the time to pick up strange
      acquaintances."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two young friends were now satisfied of Hourigan's falsehood, and
      perhaps of his treachery; and a very slight but significant glance to that
      effect passed between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well," said the magistrate, "we&mdash;I mane myself, at any rate&mdash;are
      well able to protect ourselves. I shall not in future travel unarmed, and
      he that&mdash;hem&mdash;ahem&mdash;he that will mistake me for a timid man
      will find out his error maybe when it's too late. Come, Hourigan, what
      charge is this you have against Mr. Purcel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plaise your honor, he abused, and assaulted, and bate me until I didn't
      know for a time whether I was alive or dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How was that, Hourigan, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bekaise, your honor, I had not my tides for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now that I look at you, you certainly have the marks of violence about
      you. Well, but did you give no provocation, sir? It's not likely Mr.
      Purcel would raise his hand to you if he had not resaved strong
      provocation at yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorra word, then, your honor, ever I said to him,&mdash;barrin' to tell
      him that I hoped he'd have compassion on me and my little family, and not
      drive us to ruin for what I wasn't able to pay. He then asked me, was that
      the answer I had for him, and not his money, and he does no more but ups
      wid his whip and laves me as you see me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, now, you d&mdash;d scoundrel!" exclaimed John, "how can you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, Mr. Purcel," said the magistrate, interrupting him with what
      he intended to be dignity, "you forget what is due to the court, sir.
      There must be no swearing nor abuse here. The court must be respected, Mr.
      Purcel."
    </p>
    <p>
      These words brought a sneer of secret triumph upon Hourigan's features,
      that was unquestionably very provoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg to apologize to the court," replied Purcel, "if for a moment I have
      forgotten what is due to it; but, in fact, your worship, there is not one
      word of truth in what he says. His language was insolent and provoking
      beyond the limits of human patience. He told me that both my father and
      myself were dishonest&mdash;that we were oppressors of the poor, and
      blood-suckers; called us hardhearted and beggarly upstarts, and that we
      would sell our Church and our country for filthy lucre and upstart pride.
      Instead, your worship, of promising to pay his tithes, he said we might go
      to hell for them, and make the devil our paymaster, what he'll be yet. And
      further, he said he'd never pay a farthing of them, and set law, lawyers,
      police, military, and magistrates all at open defiance. Now I beg to know,
      your worship, what loyal and peaceably-disposed man, that wishes to see
      the laws of his country, and those respectable magistrates that administer
      them, respected&mdash;what man, I say, fond of peace and quietness, could
      bear such language as that? It is not what he said of either myself or my
      family that I contain of, but of the abuse he heaped upon the law at
      large, and the independent magistrates of the country. I certainly, in the
      heat of the moment, so far resented the affront offered to the most
      respectable magistracy of this fine country as to give him a few slight
      touches of the whip, more like one in jest, I assure your worship, than
      like an angry man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hourigan," said O'Driscol, swelling up to a state of the most pompous
      indignation, "this is infamous conduct which he relates of you, sir. How
      dare you, sir, or any impudent fellow like you, take the undaicent and
      unjustifiable liberty of abusing the independent and loyal magistracy of
      Ireland? It is by fellows like you, sir, that traison and sedition are
      hatched. Your conduct was gross and monstrous, and if Mr. Purcel had come
      to me and made affidavit of the language stated, I would have consithered
      it my duty to commit you. Such language, sirra, was seditious!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," replied Hourigan, "and you would be right; but there is not one
      word of truth in what Mr. Purcel says, your worship; for instead of that,
      plaise your reverence, when I threatened to come to you to get the law
      against him&mdash;'I'll go to Squire Driscol,' says I, 'and that's the
      gintleman that will give me justice at any rate.' 'You and Squire Driscol
      may go be hanged,' says he; 'I don't regard him a traneen; he thinks,
      since he has been made into a justice of pace, that the ground's not
      worthy to carry him,' says he. Can you deny that, Mr. John?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Purcel's limbs began to move, and his very flesh to creep with indignation
      at the impudent but artful falsehoods of Hourigan, who was likely to
      succeed in touching the magistrate's weak points with such effect as to
      gain him over to his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worthy official shook his head with a kind of very high-minded pride,
      as much as to say, I am far above the level of such observations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Purcel," said he&mdash;"he&mdash;hem&mdash;hem&mdash;I am sorry to
      hear that you could give way to such extramely indiscreet and
      disrespectful language as this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Swear him, sir," said Purcel, "and let him be put to his oath, for I
      protest to heaven, Mr. O'Driscol, and as I am, I trust, an honest man, I
      never once mentioned your name, nor was there the slightest allusion made
      to it&mdash;none, sir, whatever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The truth is, I should think it very, strange, Mr. Purcel, and very odd,
      and very unfriendly and disenganious in you to spake of any magistrate in
      such a style as that. However, Sam, take the book and swear Hourigan."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam accordingly took the book, and putting it into Hourigan's hand, said,
      "You shall make true answers to such questions as shall be put to you, and
      swear the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you
      God, and one-and-sixpence to me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind the one-and-sixpence at present, Sam," said his master, "he
      owes you nothing now. Proceed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hourigan's thumb had the genuine angle on the back of the book, but it did
      not escape Sam, who said, "You intend to kiss your thumb, Hourigan, but
      it's no go; here, sir, stand there, so that the book won't be a screen for
      you; turn round&mdash;there now&mdash;proceed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hourigan, finding that the evasion in this instance was impracticable,
      gave it a strong, derisive smack that might be heard outside the room. "I
      hope," he added, "you are satisfied now, Mr. Finigan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," replied Sam, "that you've kissed the book when you were made to
      do it; but I see jist as clearly that the sorra much truth are we goin' to
      get out of yoU."
    </p>
    <p>
      The case then proceeded; but as it would prove, probably, rather tiresome
      to the generality of our readers, we shall not give it at length. It was
      quite evident, however, that the plaintiff and defendant both were well
      acquainted with the vacillating and timid character of the magistrate, who
      in the case before us was uniformly swayed by the words of the last
      speaker; and it was equally evident that each speaker so shaped his
      arguments as that they might the more effectually bear upon O'Driscol's
      weak points.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hem&mdash;hem&mdash;this, I persave, turns out to be a very important and
      difficult case, Mr. Purcel&mdash;a very difficult case, Hourigan&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;a
      case indeed that requires great deliberation and coolness. Here is strong
      provocation on one hand, and prompt punishment on the other. Can you
      swear, Mr. Purcel, to the accuracy and substance of the language you say
      Hourigan uttered?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, sir, without hesitation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because if he does, Hourigan, I shall be obliged, according to Act of
      Parliament, sir&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hourigan interrupted him by a groan, and a rather significant shrug.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you shrug and groan for, sir?" asked the man of law, who felt
      both acts incompatible with the respect due to the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mavrone!" exclaimed Hourigan, "acts of Parliament! oh! thin many a
      bitther piece of cruelty and injustice has been practised upon us by Act
      o' Parliament!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ho, you traisonable villain!" exclaimed the other&mdash;"what sedition is
      this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is sich Acts o' Parliament," said the adroit knave, "that gets good
      men and good magistrates shot like dogs, an' that has brought the counthry
      to the fearful pass it's in, I wisht myself I was out of it, for the
      people is beginnin' to single out sich magistrates as they'll shoot, as if
      their lives worn't worth a rat's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!&mdash;hem&mdash;hem&mdash;Hourigan, you are a d&mdash;d ras&mdash;hem
      simple-hearted fellow, I think, or you wouldn't spake as you do.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But an I to get not justice sir, against the man that left me as you see
      me. Is the poor man, sir, to be horse-whipped and cut up at the will an'
      pleasure of the rich, an'not to get either law or justice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      O'Driscol's face was now a picture of most ludicrous embarrassment and
      distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, Hourigan, I shall&mdash;hem&mdash;I shall always administer
      justice impartially&mdash;impartially&mdash;no one can question that. Your
      case," he added&mdash;(for we must say here that Hourigan's language
      brought back to his mind all the horrors of Tandrem's death, as well as
      that threatened to himself in the recent notice)&mdash;"your case,
      Hourigan is a difficult and peculiar one, poor man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hourigan, my good fellow," said Purcel, "take care of what you are about.
      Don't be too certain that some of your neighbors won't find you, before
      you are much older, in the centre of a deep-laid conspiracy; and perhaps
      the government of the country may have an opportunity before long to thank
      and reward those who will have it exposed and broken up. Do you understand
      me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Purcel, while he spoke, kept his eyes fixed very significantly upon the
      magistrate, to whose imagination a long and interesting correspondence
      with his friend, the Castle, started immediately forth, appended to which
      were votes of thanks, flattering testimonies, together with a stipendiary
      magistracy, with a full retiring pension, and an appointment for his son,
      in the background.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has made use of that language to intimidate your worship," proceeded
      Purcel, but I think he ought to know you better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," said O'Driscol, addressing Hourigan, "what did you mane by talking
      about shooting magistrates? Do you think, sirrah, to frighten me&mdash;Fitzgerald
      O'Driscol&mdash;from discharging my duty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Frighten, you, sir! oh! bedad, your honor, you aren't the gintleman for
      that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir, I believe not&mdash;I believe not, Hourigan; no, my poor man, I
      am not indeed. Hourigan, you are not an uncivil person, but why refuse to
      pay your tithes? You are well able to do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, bekaise I daren't, sir; if I did&mdash;talkin' about shootin'&mdash;it's
      a round lump of lead I would find in my stomach instead o' my poor
      breakfast, some o' these days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't doubt but he is right enough there, your worship," observed
      Purcel, "there's a conspiracy&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," exclaimed the magistrate, "oh! ay!&mdash;yes!&mdash;hem&mdash;a
      conspiracy! Well&mdash;no matter&mdash;let it rest for a little. Well&mdash;as
      this case is one of great difficulty, involving several profound points of
      law, I would recommend you to make it up, and be friends. Hourigan, you
      will forgive Mr. Purcel, who is hasty but generous. You will forgive him,
      I say, and he will give you something in the shape of a&mdash;salve for
      your wounds. Come, forgive him, Hourigan, and I will overlook, on my part,
      the seditious language you used against the Irish magistracy; and,
      besides, you will make me your friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive him, sir!" said Hourigan, shrugging himself, and putting up his
      hand to feel the welts of black and blue which intersected each other upon
      his countenance and shoulders. "An' maybe it's half-a-crown he'll threwn
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, Hourigan, I'll guarantee for him that he'll treat you liberally:
      one good turn deserves another, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, let him say what he'll give me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a pound-note for you," said Purcel, flinging it across the table.
      "If you take that, you may, but if not, I'll give no more. Your worship,
      this, you perceive, is cross-case, and if you receive examination on the
      one side, you will, of course, upon the other?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "True," replied O'Driscol, who had not thought of this, and who seized
      upon it as a perfect relief to him; "true, Mr. Purcel, it is a cross-case,
      and so I understand it. Let me recommend you to take the money, Hourigan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, your honor, I will, on your account, and bekaise, as your
      worship says, bekaise one good tarn desarues another, an' ought to get it.
      I'm satisfied for the present." And as he spoke, he turned, in a skulking,
      furtive manner, such a look upon Purcel as we will not attempt to
      describe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Hourigan," said O'Driscol, "I am glad I have settled this matter in
      your favor. If I had taken Mr. Purcel's informations, you would have
      certainly been transported; but the truth is, and I trust you have seen it
      this day, and will allow it, that in my magisterial capacity, although
      just and impartial I hope, yet, still, whenever I can with raison, I am
      always disposed to lane towards the poor man, and be the poor man's
      magistrate&mdash;hem&mdash;ahem!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, plaise your honor," said Hourigan, rather drily, "but it's so hard
      to make the people at large believe the truth, sir. Good-mornin', your
      worship, an' many thanks for the illigant justice you gave me.
      Good-mornin' you, too, Misther Purcel; I hope we'll be betther friends,
      sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I hope you will pay your tithes, and keep a civiler tongue in your
      head," replied the latter, as Hourigan left the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before this weighty matter was determined, Fergus O'Driscol, although
      satisfied that Hourigan and their new laborer were acquainted, resolved to
      corroborate his evidence of the fact, if possible, and for this purpose he
      sent the fellow, as had been agreed on, to walk Purcel's horse up and down
      the lower part of the avenue, near the entrance gate, which was somewhat
      secluded and not within view of the house, for the avenue was a winding
      one. In the meantime he stationed himself in a clump of trees, to which he
      went by a back walk in the shrubbery that was concealed from that part of
      the avenue. Here, we say, he stationed himself to watch these worthies,
      but, unfortunately, at too great a distance to hear their conversation,
      should they speak and recognize each other. On this subject he was not
      permitted to remain long in suspense. Hourigan soon made his appearance,
      and, on approaching the stringer, looked cautiously about him in every
      direction, whilst the latter, who had been walking Purcel's horse towards
      the house, suddenly turned back, and kept conversing with Hourigan until
      they reached the entrance gate, where they stood for about ten minutes in
      close and evidently confidential dialogue, as was clear from their
      watching in all directions, to make certain that they were not observed.
      They then shook hands, cordially, and Hourigan bent his steps towards the
      town of Lisnagola. Fergus, who had seen all their motions most distinctly,
      took occasion to pass up the avenue a few minutes afterwards, where he met
      the stranger still leading Purcel's horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's your name, my good fellow?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Phil Hart, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know if the man who summoned Mr. Purcel before my father has gone
      out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know, plaise your honor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did any person go out within the last few minutes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir, there went a man out; maybe it was him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't know Hourigan's appearance, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir. Hourigan, was that his name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Are you a native of this county?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not exactly, sir; but I have friends in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Ahernes, sir, up in the mountains behind Lisnagola beyant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who recommended you to Mr. Arthur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His brother-in-law, sir, one Frank Finnerty, in the mountains above; that
      is, they're both marrid upon the two shisthers, plaise your honor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what caused you to leave your native place?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, sir, my father houlds a bit o' land; he owed some tithe, sir, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would not pay it; they consequently took proceedings&mdash;you resisted
      the execution of the law, and then you had to run for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, not exactly, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How was it, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, sir, we paid the tithes; an' whin this was discovered, I, at any
      rate, had to run for it. The people, your honor, found out that it was I
      that ped them, an' I was glad, of coorse, to fly for my life. I'd thank
      you, sir, to keep what I tould you to yourself, for even if it was known
      in this neighborhood that I ped them, I wouldn't be safe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't know Hourigan, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How could I, sir, and me a sthranger?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith, and whether you do or not, it seems to me there's a strong family
      likeness between you and him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe so," the fellow replied, with a grin. "I hear my father say that he
      sartinly was down in this counthry when he was sowin' his wild oats:" and
      with this observation he passed on with the horse he was leading.

      CHAPTER VIII.&mdash;An Unreformed Church
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &mdash;The Value of Public Opinion&mdash;Be not Familiar with the Great
    </h3>
    <p>
      Recent circumstances have, unfortunately, shown us the danger of tampering
      with, and stimulating, the blind impulses of ignorant prejudice and
      popular passion beyond that limit where the powers of restraint cease to
      operate with effect. At the period which our narrative has now reached,
      and for a considerable time before it, those low rumblings which stunned
      and frightened the ear of civilized society, like the ominous sounds that
      precede an earthquake, were now followed by those tremblings and
      undulations which accompany the shock itself. But before we describe that
      social condition to which we refer, it is necessary that we should
      previously raise the vail a little, which time has drawn between us and
      the condition of the Established Church, not merely at that crisis, but
      for a long period before it. This we shall do as briefly as possible,
      because we feel that it is an exceedingly unpleasant task to contemplate a
      picture which presents to us points of observation that are, from their
      very nature, painful to look upon&mdash;and features so secular and
      carnal, that scarcely any language could exaggerate, much less distort
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Established Church in Ireland, then, in its unpurged and unreformed
      state, was very little else than a mere political engine for supporting
      and fostering British interests and English principles in this country;
      and no one, here had any great chance of preferment in it who did not
      signalize himself some way in favor of British policy. The Establishment
      was indeed the only bond that bound the political interests of the two
      nations together. But if any person will now venture to form an opinion of
      the Irish Church from her gorgeousness and immense wealth at that period,
      he will unquestionably find that what ought to have been a spiritual,
      pure, holy, self-denying, and zealous Church, was neither more nor less
      than an overgrown, proud, idle, and indolent Establishment, bloated by
      ease and indulgence, and corrupted almost to the very core by secular and
      political prostitution. The state of the Establishment was indeed equally
      anomalous and disgraceful. So jealous was England, and at the same time so
      rapacious of its wealth, that it was parcelled out to Englishmen without
      either shame or scruple, whilst Irish piety and learning, when they did
      happen to be found, were uniformly overlooked and disregarded. All the
      ecclesiastical offices of dignity and emolument were bestowed upon
      Englishmen; upon men who lived here with reluctance, and but seldom&mdash;who
      had no sympathy with the country or its inhabitants&mdash;nay, who looked
      upon us, in general, with feeling of hostility and contempt; and who, by
      example or precept, rendered no earthly equivalent for the enormous sums
      that were drawn from a poor and struggling people. It is idle to say that
      these prodigious ecclesiastical revenues were not paid by the people, but
      by the landlord, who, if the people had not paid them, would have added
      them to the rent. But even so&mdash;the straggling peasant reasoned
      naturally, for he felt it to be one thing to pay even a high rent to the
      landlord, whose rights, as such, he acknowledged, but a very different
      thing to pay forth out of his own pocket a tenth of his produce to the
      pastor of a hostile creed, which had little sympathy with him, for which
      he received no spiritual equivalent, and on which, besides, he was taught
      to look as a gross and ungodly heresy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was not the worst of it. In the discussion of this subject, it is
      rather hazardous for the champion of our former Establishment to make any
      allusion to the landlord at all; the fact unfortunately being, that in the
      management and disposal of land, the landlords, in general, were gifted
      with a very convenient forgetfulness that such a demand as tithe was to
      come upon the tenant at all. The land in general was let as if it had been
      tithe-free, whilst, at the same time, and in precisely the same grasping
      spirit, it so happened, that wherever it was tithe-free the rents exacted
      were also enormous, and seen as&mdash;supposing tithe had not an existence&mdash;no
      country ever could suffer to become the basis of valuation, or to settle
      down into a system. In fact, such was the spirit, and so profligate the
      condition of the Established Church for a long lapse of time, both before
      and after the Union, that we may lay it down as a general principle, that
      everything was rewarded in it but piety and learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there were anything wanting to prove the truth and accuracy of our
      statements, it would be found in the bitter and relentless spirit with
      which the Established Church and her pastors were assailed, at the period
      of which we write. And let it be observed here, that even then, the Church
      in this country, in spirit, in learning, in zeal, and piety, was an angel
      of purity compared to what she had been twenty or thirty years before. The
      course of clerical education had been defined, established, and extended;
      young profligates could not enter the Church, as in the good old times,
      without any earthly preparation, either in learning or morals. They were
      obliged to read, and thoroughly to understand, an extensive and
      enlightened course of divinity&mdash;to attend lectures and entitle
      themselves, both by attendance and answering, to a certain number of
      certificates, without which they had no chance for orders. In point of
      fact, they were forced to become serious; and the consequences soon began
      to appear in the general character of the Church. Much piety, activity,
      learning, and earnest labor were to be found in it; and indeed, we may
      venture to say, that, with the exception of her carnal and debasing
      wealth, she had been purified and reformed to a very considerable extent,
      even then. Still, however, the bloated mass of mammon hung about her,
      prostrating her energies, secularizing her spirit, and, we must add,
      oppressing the people, out of whose pockets it was forced to come. When
      the calamity, therefore, which the reader may perceive is partly upon and
      impending over, the Protestant clergy, actually occurred, it did not find
      them unprepared, nor without the sympathy of many of the very people who
      were forced by the tyrannical influence of party feeling to oppose them
      publicly. To their sufferings and unexampled patience, however, we shall
      be obliged to refer, at a subsequent period of our narrative; and for that
      reason, we dismiss it for the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such, then, was the state of the Protestant Established Church for a
      considerable length of time before the tithe agitation, and also
      immediately preceding it; and we deemed it necessary to make the reader
      acquainted with both, in order that he may the better understand the
      nature and spirit of the almost universal assault which was, by at least
      one party&mdash;the Roman Catholic&mdash;so furiously made upon it. At the
      present period of our narrative, then, the population of the country,
      especially of the South and West, had arrived at that state of agitation,
      which, whether its object be legitimate or not, is certain, in a short
      time, to brutalize the public mind and debauch the public morals, by
      removing all the conscientious impediments which religion places against
      crime, and consequently all scruple in committing it. Heretofore, those
      vile societies of a secret nature, that disgrace the country and debase
      the character of her people, existed frequently under separate
      denominations, and for distinct objects. Now, however, they all consented
      to abandon these peculiar purposes, and to coalesce into one great
      conspiracy against the destruction of the Establishment. We do not mean to
      assert, however, that this general outcry against the Church, and its
      accompanying onslaught on her property, originated directly with the
      people. No such thing; the people, as they always are, and, we fear, ever
      will be, were mere instruments in the hands of a host of lay and clerical
      agitators; and no argument was left unattempted or unurged to hound them
      on to the destruction of the Establishment. From the Corn Exchange down to
      the meanest and most obscure tribunal of agitation throughout the kingdom,
      the virtues of passive resistance were inculcated and preached, and the
      great champion of popular rights told the people publicly and repeatedly
      that they might not be afraid to follow his advice, for that it mattered
      little how oppressive or stringent any act of parliament in defence of the
      Established Church might be, he would undertake to drive a coach and six
      through the very severest of its penalties. Nor were the Catholic
      priesthood idle during these times of storm and commotion. At the head of
      them, and foremost in both ability and hatred of tithes, stood the late
      Dr. Doyle, the celebrated J.K.L. of that day, Bishop of Kildare and
      Leighlin; a man to whose great intellectual powers the country at large
      chiefly owes the settlement of that most difficult and important question.
      This able prelate assailed the system with a fiery vehemence that
      absolutely set the country in a blaze, and reduced the wealthy
      Establishment to a case of the most unprecedented distress. Who can forget
      that memorable apothegm to the Irish people on the subject? "Let your
      hatred of tithes," he said, "be as lasting as your sense of justice."
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately it is an easy task to instruct or tempt the Irish peasant to
      violate the law, especially when sanctioned, in that violation, by those
      whose opinion and advice he takes as the standard of his conduct. Be this
      as it may, the state of the country was now becoming frightful and
      portentous; and although there had not, as yet, been much blood shed,
      still there was no person acquainted with the extraordinary pains which
      were taken to excite the people against the payment of tithe, who was not
      able to anticipate the terrible outburst and sanguinary slaughters which
      soon followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have already detailed a midnight meeting of the anti-tithe confederacy;
      but so confident had the people soon become in the principle of general
      unanimity against the payment of this impost, that they did not hesitate
      to traverse the country in open day by thousands; thus setting not only
      law, but all the powers of the country by which it is usually carried out
      and supported, at complete defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Threatening letters, and notices of violent death, signed with blood, and
      containing the form of a coffin, were sent to all such as were in any way
      obnoxious, or, what was the same thing, who were in any way disposed
      either to pay tithes or exact them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this state matters were, when, one morning about a week after the scene
      we have just described in O'Driscol's office, a dialogue to the following
      effect took place in the proctor's immense farm-yard, between our friend
      Mogue Moylan and his quondam sweetheart, Letty Lenehan. Letty, of late,
      that is since the morning of the peddler's conversation with Mogue, had
      observed that some unaccountable change had taken place in his whole
      manner, not only towards herself, but in his intercourse with the rest of
      his fellow-servants. He was for instance, much more silent that he had
      ever been: but although he spoke less, he appeared to think more; yet it
      might be observed, that whatever the subject of his thoughts was, it
      evidently had diffused a singular degree of serenity, and a peculiarly
      striking complacency through his whole manner. With respect to herself he
      had ascended from the lover into the patron; and although she had been
      amusing herself at his expense throughout their previous courtship, if it
      could be termed such, yet she felt no less puzzled as to the cause of such
      a change, and quite as anxious to ascertain it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning in question, Mogue and Jerry Joyce had been engaged in
      winnowing a large quantity of wheat in the barn. Jerry, whose manner was
      ostensibly that of a soft, simple young fellow, and whom but few looked
      upon as possessed of the ordinary run of common sense, was treated by
      Mogue, and indeed by most, but not all of his fellow servants, as one
      would treat a young lad who had not yet arrived at years of discretion, or
      maturity of judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jerry," said Mogue, "why but you do be cortin' the girls, man alive? That
      I may never sin but it's a great thing to have them fond o' one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay," replied Jerry, who was perfectly well aware of his foible, "if I had
      the art of sootherin' and puttin' my comedher an thim like some o' my
      acquaintances; but, me! is it foolish Jerry Joyce they'd care about? Oh,
      no! begor that cock wouldn't fight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your acquaintances!" exclaimed Mogue, seizing upon the term, in Jerry's
      reply, which he knew referred to himself, "and which of your
      acquaintances, now, does be sootherin' an' puttin' his comedher an' them,
      eh, Jerry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! dear me, Mogue," replied the other, "how droll you are! As if you
      thought I didn't mane one Mogue Moylan that they're tearin' their caps
      about every day in the week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tearin' their caps! arrah, who is, Jerry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, the girls."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The girls! Och! man, sure that's an ould story; but I declare it to you,
      Jerry, it isn't my fault; it's a nateral gift wid me, for I take no pains
      to make them fond o' me; that I may never do harm if I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' how does it, happen that they are? Sure there's Letty, now&mdash;poor
      Letty Lenehan&mdash;an' God help her! sure, for the last week, she appears
      to me to be breakin' her heart. She doesn't say af coorse, that you're the
      occasion of it; but doesn't every one of us know that you are? Have you
      been could to her, or what?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why thin, now, Jerry, I declare it to you that I'm heart sorry for poor
      Letty; but what can I do? I amn't my own man, now, do you hear that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure you don't mane to say that you're married?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not exactly married; but listen hither, Jerry&mdash;you don't know the
      man you're spakin' to&mdash;it's a gift that God gave me&mdash;but, you
      don't know the man you're spakin' to; however as for poor Letty, I'll
      provide for her some way&mdash;the poor affectionate crature; an' she's
      good-lookin' too; however, as I said, I'll do something for her some way,"
      and here he nodded and winked with most villainous significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Jerry had not fully comprehended the scoundrel's character, it is very
      probable that this language would have caused him to give the hypocritical
      villain a sound drubbing; for it must be known to our readers, that Jerry
      and Letty were faithfully attached to each other&mdash;a circumstance
      which was also known to the whole family, and which nothing could have
      prevented Mogue from observing but his own blind and egregious vanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what do you mane, Mogue, when you say you aren't your own man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't tell you; but the thruth is, Jerry&mdash;poor, good-natured Jerry&mdash;that
      every man ought to look high, especially when he sees the regard that's
      for him, and especially, too, when God&mdash;blessed be his name&mdash;has
      gifted him as some people is gifted. There's a man hereabouts that thinks
      he could put my nose out o' joint. Oh! it's a great thing, Jerry, to have
      nice, ginteel, thin features, that won't spoil by the weather. Throth, red
      cheeks or a white skin in a man isn't becomin'; an' as for larnin', Jerry,
      it may require a long time to take it in, but a very little hole would
      soon let it all out. May I never do harm but I'm glad that job's over,"
      alluding to the employment at which they were engaged. "Oh! then, but
      that's a fine cast o' whate!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is," replied Jerry; "but in regard to the larnin' I don't undherstand
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No matther for that, Jerry, I may be a good friend to you yet; ay, indeed
      may I&mdash;poor good-natured Jerry; an' when that time comes, if you have
      any scruple in axin' Misther Moylan to countenance you and befriend you,
      why it'll be your own fault my poor, good-natured Jerry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Many thanks, Misther Moylan," replied Jerry, assuming a gravity which he
      could scarcely maintain, "remember that you don't forget your promise. I'm
      goin' over to get the sacks from Misther John; an' by the way, aren't you
      goin' out to-day to shoot wid Misther M'Carthy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I declare, I believe I am; I know the mountains well, an' I'm fond
      of seein' fun, or of hearin' of it, any way."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerry then departed, and Mogue, now left to himself, exclaimed in a
      soliloquy, "Ay, an' if I don't see it this night, I'll hear of it
      to-morrow, I hope. Mr. M'Carthy, you're in my way; but as I said to that
      poor <i>omadhawn</i>, although it took many a year to get the larnin' into
      that head of yours, one little hole will soon let it out again." As Mogue
      uttered the last words, the ear of Letty Lenehan was somewhat nearer him
      than he imagined. She had come to call them to breakfast, and seeing that
      the back-door of the barn was open, she approached it, as being nearest to
      her, and on peeping in, half disposed for a piece of frolic, she heard
      Mogue utter the soliloquy we have just repeated; but as he stood with his
      back towards her, he was not at all aware that she was present, or had
      heard him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately after breakfast, Mogue and M'Carthy set out for the mountains,
      the latter furnished with all the necessary equipments for the sport, and
      the former carrying a game-bag and refreshments; for as M'Carthy knew that
      it must be the last day he could devote to such amusements, he resolved to
      have a good day's sport, if possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Mogue," said his companion, "you are much better acquainted with
      these mountains than I am, and with those places where we may be likely to
      find most game. I, therefore, place myself in your hands for the day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, indeed I ought, sir, to know them," replied Mogue, "and I believe I
      do; and talkin' of that, you have often heard of the great robber and
      rapparee, Shaun Bernha?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have heard of him, and of his Stables, which lie up somewhere in these
      mountains."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly, sir; an' it is what I was thinkin'; that we might take a look at
      them in the coorse of our sport to-day; in regard, especially, that
      there's more game about them than in any other part of the mountains."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, then, Mogue," replied his companion, "so be it; you are, as I
      said, my guide for the day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But do you know, sir, why he was called Shaun Bernha?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I can't say I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was odd enough, to be sure. Howandever, may I be happy but they say
      it's true! You see, sir, he was called Shaun Bernha bekaise he never had a
      tooth in his head; an' no more had any of his family; and yet, sir, it's
      said, that he could bite a piece out of a plate of sheet iron as aisily as
      you or I could out a cake of gingerbread."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Morgue, all that I can say to that is, that he had devilish hard
      gums, and stood in no fear of the toothache."
    </p>

      "Well, then, we'll sweep around the slebeen hills here, keepin'
      Altnaveenan to our right, and Lough Mocall to our left; then, by going
      right ahead we'll come to his stables; and indeed they're well worth
      seein'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With all my heart, Mague, never say it again." And they accordingly
      proceeded at a vigorous pace to the mountains, which were now distant not
      more than a mile and a half from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime we shall leave them to pursue their game, and beg our
      readers to accompany us once more to the house of our friend, Fitzy
      O'Driscol, who, what between the dread of assassination on the one hand,
      and the delight of having a proper subject to justify him in communicating
      with the government on the other, passed his time in alterations, now of
      fear, and again of his peculiar ambition to be recognized as an active and
      fearless magistrate by the then existing powers, that were, to such as
      knew the man and understood his character, perfectly ludicrous. On the
      morning in question, he was, as usual, seated, in his morning-gown and
      slippers, at the breakfast-table, reading a country paper, in which, by
      the way, appeared the following paragraph:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "TURBULENT STATE OR THE COUNTRY.&mdash;We regret to say, that the state of
      the country is every day becoming more and more unsettled. A few days ago,
      whilst one of our excellent and most resolute magistrates, Fitzgerald
      O'Driscol, Esq., was engaged in his office, determining an important case
      of assault that came before him, and which he did, as he usually does, to
      the perfect satisfaction of the parties, he received, a threatening
      notice, couched in most violent language, in fact, breathing of blood and
      assassination! Why a gentleman of such high magisterial character as Mr.
      O'Driscol should have been selected as an object of popular vengeance, we
      do not understand. Mr. O'Driscol combines in himself all those qualities
      that are peculiarly suited to the discharge of his duties in such
      distracted times as the present. Whilst firm and intrepid, almost to a
      miracle, he is at the same time easy of access, impartial, and kind to his
      humble countrymen, to whom he has uniformly proved himself mild and
      indulgent, so far as justice&mdash;which by the way, he always tempers
      with mercy&mdash;will allow him; and in consequence of this, he is
      uniformly known, and deserves to be known, as the poor man's magistrate.
      It is true, he is known also to be a man of highly loyal and
      constitutional principles; a warm friend to order, peace, and a resolute
      supporter of the laws of the land&mdash;qualities which are looked upon as
      crimes by the resolute and disloyal among our kind-hearted but misguided
      people. Of one thing, however, he would beg to apprise the mistaken
      individuals who have ventured to threaten him, and that is, to take care
      how they attempt to put their foolish threats into execution against so
      daring and desperate a man as Mr. O'Driscol is when provoked. He goes well
      armed, is a dead shot, and would feel deeply grieved at having the blood
      of any of his mistaken countrymen on his hands. This we say from what we
      know of Mr. O'Driscol, both as a man and as a magistrate. In further
      connection with the state of the country, we cannot think but that
      government, if made properly acquainted with it, would place some mild,
      firm, but fearless and resolute stipendiary magistrate in our
      neighborhood; we mean, of course, a man who is capable, by the peculiar
      qualities of his character, to make himself an instrument of great public
      good, both to the people and the government. Such a man we know; but as we
      are writing without either his knowledge or consent, we do not feel
      ourselves called upon to pursue this important subject further. All we can
      say is, that the violent opposition which is now organized against tithes,
      and which is already beginning to convulse the country, will, and even now
      does require, the active courage and decided abilities of such a man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, now, Catherine," said he, addressing his daughter, who sat near
      him, "upon my honor and conscience that was a friendly paragraph of my
      friend Swiggerly&mdash;extremely so, indeed. The fact is, a dinner and a
      good jorum is never thrown away upon honest Swiggerly; for which raison
      I'll ask him to dine here on Thursday next."
    </p>
    <p>
      He then handed her the paper, pointing out the paragraph in question,
      which she read with something of an arch smile, and which, on her brother
      Fergus (who had been to Lisnagola) joining them, she handed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fergus," said she, looking at him with an expression of character still
      more comic, but yet sufficiently subdued to prevent O'Driscol from
      observing it, "is not that paragraph very complimentary to papa?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Fergus, who at once reciprocated the comic glance alluded to, replied
      rather significantly, "It is certainly very gratifying to him, Catherine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And very creditable to Swiggerly," added O'Driscol.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, father," replied Fergus, "but I think he ought to preserve, if
      possible, a little more originality. The substance of that paragraph has
      been regularly in his paper, in one shape or other, three or four times a
      year during the last couple of years. I ought to except the introduction
      of the threatening notice, which certainly is a new feature, and the only
      new one in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fergus," said the father, whilst his round, red, convivial features
      became more inflamed, "you are super-critical this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all, sir; but you will excuse me for saying, that I think a man
      who is seeking to ingratiate himself with the government, what is more, to
      receive substantial favors from it, ought not, from principles of
      self-respect, to suffer these stereotyped paragraphs to appear from time
      to time. Government is not so blind, sir, but they will at once see
      through the object of such paragraphs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Staryrayotyped! What the devil, sir, do you mane by staryrayotype? Do you
      mane to make a staryrayotype of me? That's dutiful, Mr. Fergus&mdash;filial
      duty, clane and clear&mdash;and no doubt about it. But I tell you, sir,
      that in spite of your staryrayotypes, it is such articles as the able one
      of my friend Swiggerly that constitutes the force of public opinion.
      Government! Why, sir, the government is undher more obligations to me than
      I am to them. It was my activity and loyalty that was the manes,
      principally, of returnin' the son of the gustus ratalorum of the county
      for the borough of Addleborough. He was their own candidate; and if that
      wasn't layin' them undher an obligation to me, I don't know what was. You
      may say what you like, but I repate, it's a right good, thing to have the
      force of public opinion in your favor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, of public opinion, I grant you; but surely you cannot pretend,
      father, that such gross and barefaced flattery as that can be termed
      public opinion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why not, sir? Upon my honor and conscience, things is come to a
      pretty pass when a man&mdash;a magistrate&mdash;like me, must be lectured
      by his own son! Isn't it too bad, Catherine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am no politician, you know, but I think he doesn't mean to lecture you,
      papa; perhaps you ought to say to reason or remonstrate with&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Raison! remonstrate! And what right has he aither to raison or
      remonstrate with a man&mdash;or rather a magistrate&mdash;such as I am
      known by the government to be. He calls that paragraph gross and barefaced
      flattery, and myself a staryrayotype! but I tell him now that it is no
      flattery, nor anything at all but the downright naked thruth, and no man
      ought to know that better than I do, for this good raison, that it was
      myself wrote every line of it, and got Swiggerly only to correct it."
    </p>
    <p>
      A deep and crimson blush overspread his daughter's face on hearing this
      mean and degrading admission; and Fergus, who was in the act of bringing a
      bit of ham to his mouth, suddenly laid it down again, then looked first at
      Catherine, then at his father, several times in succession. The
      good-humored girl, however, whose merry heart and light spirits always
      disposed her to look at the pleasant side of everything, suddenly glancing
      at the red, indignant face with which her father, in the heat of argument,
      and in order to illustrate the truth of public opinion in this instance,
      had made the acknowledgment&mdash;all at once, and before the rosy blush
      had departed from her beautiful face, burst out into a ringing and merry
      laugh, which Fergus felt to be contagious and irresistible. On glancing
      again at his father, he joined her in the mirth, and both laughed long and
      heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so, father," proceeded Fergus, "you bring us a paragraph written by
      yourself, to illustrate the value of public opinion; but believe me, my
      dear father, and I mean it with all respect, these puffs, whether written
      by one's self or others&mdash;these political puffs I say, like literary
      ones, always do more harm than good to the object they are intended to
      serve."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never you mind that, Fergus, my boy, I know how to play my game, I think;
      and besides, don't you know, I expect a snug-morsel from government for
      yourself, my boy; yet you never consider that&mdash;not you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my dear father, I never wish to hear a respectable man like you
      acknowledge that he is playing a game at all; it reminds me of the
      cringing, sycophantic, and prostitute crew of political gamblers and
      manoeuvrers, by whom, not only this government, but every other, is
      perpetually assailed and infested, and amongst which crew it would grieve
      me to think that you should be included. As to myself, if I ever get
      anything from government, it must not come to me through any of those
      arrangements by which trick and management, not to say dishonesty and
      conniption, are, to the shame of all parties, so frequently rewarded. With
      a slight change upon Pope, I say&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "'Grant me honest place, or grant me none.'"
</pre>
    <p>
      "Pope! What the devil do I care about his opinions? let him preach and
      stick to his controversy with Father Tom&mdash;from whom he hadn't so much
      to brag of&mdash;but as for you, Fergus, you are, to spake plainly, a
      thorough ass. What d&mdash;d stuff you have been letting out of you! Go
      and find, if you can, some purer world for yourself to live in, for, let
      me tell you, you are not fit for this. There is no perfection here,
      Catherine, is there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, Papa! certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is&mdash;is there? Well, upon my honor and conscience, now, this is
      the first time I've heard that argument used. Come, then, how do you prove
      it&mdash;eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is perfection, papa, occasionally at least, to be found among
      women, and&mdash;you certainly, sir, cannot deny the truth of this&mdash;occasionally,
      too, among magistrates&mdash;ha ha! ha!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! Kate, I know you of old! Very good that&mdash;extremely good, upon my
      word However, as I was saying, if you don't act and think as the world
      about you acts and thinks, you had as good, as I said, get a betther one
      if you can. Here, now, I see Mat Purcel coming up the avenue; and as I
      want to have some private conversation with him, I must be off to my
      office, where I desire you to send him to me. There's a time for
      everything, they say, and a place for everything&mdash;I hope, Fergy, you
      and I will have occasion, before long, to say, a place for some&mdash;ha!
      ha! ha! Well, as I said, there's a place for everything! and I don't think
      it would become me to spake upon official business anywhere but in my own
      office. We must not only do our business properly, but look like it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Purcel found our pompous little man enveloped, as we have already said, in
      a most fashionable morning-gown and embroidered slippers, and at the same
      time busily engaged in writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you do, Mr. Purcel?" said he; "will you excuse me for about three
      minutes, till I finish this paragraph, after which I am at your service?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," said Purcel, "I'm in no hurry, Fitzy, my boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here," continued the other, "amuse yourself with that paper. By the way,
      there's a flattering notice there of your humble servant, by our friend
      Swiggerly, who certainly is a man of sound judgment and ability."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't interrupt you now," replied the proctor; "but I will tell you my
      opinion of him by and by."
    </p>
    <p>
      The magistrate then proceeded to finish his paragraph, as he said, by his
      important manner of doing which, Purcel, who thoroughly understood him,
      was much amused. He frequently paused for instance, placed his chin in the
      end of his half-closed hand, somewhat like an egg in an egg-cup, looked in
      a meditative mood into Purcel's face, without appearing to see him at all;
      then went over to the library, which ought rather to have been pronounced
      his son's than his; and after having consulted a book&mdash;a Latin
      Horace, which by the way he opened at the art of poetry, of which volume
      it is, we presume, unnecessary to say, he did not understand a syllable,
      he returned to his desk seemingly satisfied, and wrote on until he had
      concluded the passage he was composing. He read it once in silence, then
      nodded his head complacently, as if satisfied with what he had Written,
      after which he rubbed his hands and closing the desk exclaimed, "D&mdash;n
      all governments, Mr. Purcel, and I wish to heaven there never had been a
      magistrate in Ireland."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what kind of doctrine is this, Fitzy," exclaimed his friend,
      "especially from such a loyal man and active magistrate as you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "D&mdash;n loyalty too, Mr. Purcel, it's breakin' my heart and will break
      it&mdash;I think I'll emigrate to America before they kill me here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, to tell you the truth, my dear Fitzy, I was a good deal alarmed when
      I heard of that ugly notice you got; but it's not every man would have
      borne the thing with such courage as you did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Mister Purcel, I feel that as a compliment coming from you;
      and by the way, I haven't forgotten to mention you with praise in my
      correspondence with the Castle. However&mdash;ha! ha! ha! you rather
      misunderstood me&mdash;I mane to say that the life is worn out of me, by
      our present government&mdash;Good God! my friend, surely they ought to
      know that there's plenty of magistrates in the country besides myself,
      that could give them the information they want upon the state of the
      country, and the steps they ought to take to tranquillize it, as well as I
      could; I can't, however, get them to think so, and the consequence is that
      that d&mdash;n Castle can't rub its elbow without consulting, me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," replied Purcel, "you are to blame yourself for it; if you were not
      so loyal, and zealous, and courageous too, as you are, they would let you
      alone and leave you to peace and quietness, as they do other people."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my honor and conscience, it's little pace or quietness they leave
      me, then; but I agree with you, that the whole cause of it is my
      well-known loyal principle and surprising activity in keeping down
      disturbance and sedition. Widow Cleary's affair was an unlucky one for me,
      and indeed, Mat, it was the activity and resolution that I displayed in
      making herself and her spawn of ragged brats prisoners at the head of the
      Possy Comeatus, aided by the military, that first brought me into notice
      with the Castle."
    </p>
    <p>
      The proctor, who feared now that he had mounted his hobby, and that he
      would inflict on him, as he was in the habit of doing after dinner, a
      long-winded series of his magisterial exploits, reminded him that he had
      expressed a wish to see him on very important business.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't care," he added, "but the truth is, Fitzy, I am pressed for
      want of time, as I should have been at the bishop's court, where I have
      cited several of these tithe rebels long before this. What is the
      business, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a matter, my dear Mr. Purcel&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why the devil do you Mr. Purcel me?" asked the proctor, warmly. "It was
      formerly Mat and Fitzy between us, and I don't see why it should not be so
      still."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hem&mdash;ahem&mdash;why it was, I grant, but then&mdash;not that I am at
      all a proud man, Mr. Purcel&mdash;far from it, I trust&mdash;but you see&mdash;hem&mdash;the
      truth is, that to a man as I am, a magistrate&mdash;trusted and&mdash;consulted
      by government, and having, besides, to meet certain low prejudices against
      me in the country, here, I don't think&mdash;I'm spaking of the magistrate
      now, Purcel&mdash;not of the man&mdash;observe that, but the truth is&mdash;d&mdash;m
      the word, for I don't think there's in the whole catalogue of names, so
      vulgar a one as Fitzy&mdash;and be d&mdash;d to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The proctor laughed till the tears came from his eyes, at the dignified
      distress with which the great little man resented this degrading
      grievance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha! ha! ha! and so," said he, "I'm not to call you Fitzy; well, well, so
      be it&mdash;but I have been so long in the habit of using it in our
      conversation, that I shall, find it a difficult matter to change the
      practice. But upon my conscience, Fitzy&mdash;I beg pardon, Mr. O'Driscol,
      I must say&mdash;I think it great weakness in your worship, to let such a
      trifle as that annoy you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may be a weakness," said the other, "but before we go further, I make
      it a personal request, that you won't use Fitzy to me, and above all
      things, in the presence of strangers. I entrate and implore that you
      won't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, then&mdash;a bargain be it&mdash;but I must insist that you
      never call me Mat, or anything but Mr. Purcel, again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, but you know you are not a magistrate, Mat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind, Fitzy&mdash;hem&mdash;never mind, your worship, call me
      whatever you like&mdash;unless a rogue&mdash;ha! ha! ha! well, but to
      business&mdash;what is this you want with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A business that, if well managed, may be a beneficial one to you and me
      both."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Out with it, though&mdash;you know I'm in a hurry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why now," proceeded the little man, relapsing unconsciously into a sense
      of his violated dignity,&mdash;"curse me, if I'd for fifty&mdash;no, not
      for a hundred, that the Castle should come to know that I was addressed as
      Fitzy."
    </p>
    <p>
      The proctor's mirth was again renewed, but after a moment or two, the
      serious part of the conversation was resumed by the magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your son John, the other morning," he proceeded, in a low and
      confidential tone, "hinted to me that you had partly discovered&mdash;hem&mdash;ahem&mdash;a
      very important circumstance&mdash;in short, that you had partly, if not
      altogether, discovered a&mdash;a conspiracy."
    </p>
    <p>
      The proctor stared at him with unaffected surprise, which, by the way, did
      not escape the magistrate's notice. "A conspiracy!" he added, "and did
      John tell you this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, not exactly," replied O'Driscol, fearing that the young man, as we
      have already hinted, had been indiscreet, and consequently wished to keep
      him as much out of blame as possible; "not exactly, my dear Mat&mdash;hem&mdash;my
      dear Mr. Purcel, but you know that I am rather sharp&mdash;a penetratin'
      fellow in my way, or I would not be of the commission to-day&mdash;he
      seemed merely to drop the expression accidentally only."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I pledge my honor to you," replied the proctor, who at once saw through
      the hoax that his son had played off upon him, "that the young rascal had
      no authority from me for mentioning a single syllable about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, but, I trust, my dear Ma&mdash;Mr; Purcel, that you are not angry
      with him, especially for having mentioned it to me at any rate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, my dear friend," said the other, "if the time were come, you are the
      first man to whom I would disclose the circumstance, but the fact simply
      is, that it is not ripe yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even so; you will have no objection, I trust, to let me know something of
      the nature of it&mdash;even now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is impossible!" replied the proctor, "quite out of my power; if I
      breathe a syllable about it, the whole matter must be blown before the
      proper time, and then&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, and what then?&mdash;proceed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, neither you nor I would be one moment safe; and in that case, it is
      much more prudent that you should not know it&mdash;God forbid that I,
      above all men, should be the person to involve you in risk and danger.
      Your own ardor and excessive loyalty expose you&mdash;to dangers enough,
      and too many."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You promise, however, when the proper time comes, to make me acquainted
      with it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, when the proper time comes; and if the thing ripen at all, you
      shall hear of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But listen," asked O'Driscol, licking his lips as a man would when
      thinking of a good dinner; "is the matter you allude to a real, actual,
      bona-fide conspiracy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An actual live conspiracy," replied the proctor; "and as soon as it has
      reached maturity, and is full grown, you shall have all the honors of the
      discovery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will do, Mat&mdash;hem, that will do my dear friend. I shall have
      the Castle dancing with delight&mdash;and whisper&mdash;but this is
      honorable between ourselves&mdash;any advantages that may result from this
      affair, you shall partake of. The Castle and I understand one another, and
      depend upon it, your name shall be mentioned with all the honor and
      importance due to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This, then, was what you wanted with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was, and upon my honor and conscience, you and yours, and I and mine,
      will have cause to rejoice in it. Government, my dear Mat&mdash;ahem&mdash;is
      a generous benefactor, and aided by it we shall work wonders. We shall, I
      trust, all be provided for&mdash;your sons and my own fool&mdash;M'Carthy,
      too, we shall not forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All that will be very pleasant, I acknowledge," replied the proctor,
      dryly, "and in the meantime good-by, and may God spare both you and me
      long life and happiness&mdash;until then, and as long after it as we may
      wish for."
    </p>
    <p>
      Our friend M'Carthy, who was little aware of the liberal provision which
      the benevolence of his friend had in contemplation for him, was in the
      meantime likely to be provided for in a very different manner, and upon
      principles very much at variance with those of that political gentleman
      yclept the Castle, an impersonation which it would be exceedingly
      difficult to define.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.&mdash;Sport in the Mountains.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the course of that day Letty Lenehan, who had been musing over Mogue's
      soliloquy in the barn, felt that kind of impression which every one has
      felt more or less under similar circumstances. The fellow's words left a
      suspicion upon her mind that there was evil designed against young
      M'Carthy by this smooth-going and pious hypocrite. How to act she felt
      somewhat at a loss, but as the day advanced, the singular impression we
      have mentioned deepened, until she could conceal its existence no longer.
      After dinner, however, she seized upon an opportunity of consulting her
      friend and lover, Jerry Joyce, who, by the way, had also been somewhat
      surprised at an expression which escaped Mogue in the morning. On
      comparing notes, both came to the same conclusion, viz.,&mdash;that there
      existed in the bosom of Mogue some latent hard feeling against M'Carthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure there does," said Jerry, "and I think I know why too&mdash;Mogue
      isn't the only person that has a deadly hatred against Mr. M'Carthy; and
      indeed, Letty, I have raisons to fear that the poor young gintleman, for
      so he is by family and blood at all events&mdash;is in great danger.
      However, if it will make your mind aisy, I'll see what can be done to get
      him safe over it this night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This night, Jerry? why what do you mane? what about this night more than
      any other night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hut! you foolish girl," replied Jerry, "sure you ought to know that it's
      only a way of spakin' we have, when we say this night or this day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay," replied Letty, with great shrewdness and in a spirit of keen
      observation, "if you had spoken that way, you'd have said this day, and
      not this night, bekaise it's not night yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerry smiled, and resolving to put an end to the conversation, exclaimed,
      "Troth and I'll have a kiss from your lips, this day, and, if you vex me
      much more, another this night too;" and as he spoke, with a face of
      good-humor and affection, he contrived to suit the action to the word,
      after which Letty sprang beyond his reach, but pausing a moment ere she
      disappeared. "Jerry, listen," she proceeded, "don't let Mr. M'Carthy come
      to harm either by night or day, if you can&mdash;still an' all remember
      that your own life is a dearer one&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;yourself, at
      any rate, than anybody else's is."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerry nodded, and was about once more to lessen the distance between
      himself and her, when she immediately took to flight and disappeared,
      which was precisely what he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God protect the young man!" he exclaimed, after she had gone, "for if
      that sleeveen villain is bent on doin' him harm, or, as I ought to say, of
      bringin' him among them, and especially to him that hates him like hell,
      this is the very night for it, and he has him on the spot too; well, we'll
      see whether they'll be back in time or not, for as Mr. M'Carthy is to dine
      here, Mogue at any rate must and ought to be home a little before dusk.
      I'll make preparation, however, and what can be done for him, I will do."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime we shall follow our two sportsmen into the mountains for a
      time, in order to render justice to poor innocent Mogue, who little dreamt
      that a human being had suspected him.
    </p>
    <p>
      M'Carthy, on entering the mountain, at first expressed a doubt to his
      companion that the circuit or sweep road by Shaun Bernha's stables was
      rather extensive, and would occupy too much time, besides bringing them
      farther out of their way than it was his (M'Carthy's) intention to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know, Mogue," he observed, "I am to dine with Mr. Purcel to-day, and,
      if we go so far, I shall never be home in time for dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0004" id="linkimage-0004">

    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">

      width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      "Never mind, sir," replied his companion, "you don't know all the short
      cuts of Sloebeens as well as I do. My life for yours, I'll take care that
      you won't want your dinner or your supper aither, sir, I'll go bail. Just
      trust yourself to me, and if I don't bring you to where the grouse,
      snipes, and hares is in thousands, never put faith in me again."
    </p>
    <p>
      M'Carthy, who had every confidence in Mogue, and, also, more than usual
      respect for him, in consequence of his apparent love of truth and
      religion, accompanied him without the slightest hesitation; feeling
      satisfied that his intimate acquaintance with the whole wild locality
      around them, was a proof that he would be able to keep his word.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scenery of those mountains, though wild, as we have said, is,
      nevertheless, remarkable for that poetic spirit of beauty which our
      learned and accomplished countryman, Dr. Petrie, infused, with such
      delightful effect, into his landscapes. Even the long stretches of level
      moor, which lie between the hill ranges, present in summer that air of
      warm repose which the mind recognizes as constituting a strong element of
      beauty; but it is at evening, when the crimson sun pours a flood of golden
      light upon their sides and tops, turning the rich flowery heath with which
      they are covered into hues of deep purple, that the eye delights to rest
      upon them. Nor is the wild charm of solitude to be forgotten in alluding
      to the character of these soft and gracefully undulating mountains. Indeed
      we scarcely knew anything more replete with those dream-like impressions
      of picturesque romance which, in a spirit so perfectly solitary, sleep,
      still and solemn, far from the on-goings of busy life, in the distant
      recesses of these barren solitudes. Many a time when young have we made
      our summer journey across the brown hills, which lay between us and the
      mountains we are describing, for the express purpose of dreaming away
      whole hours in their contemplation, and steeping our early imagination in
      the wild and novel beauty which our heart told us the spirit of solitude
      had impressed upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      How far our sportsmen proceeded, or in, what precise direction, we are not
      in a capacity to inform our readers. That they proceeded much further,
      however, than M'Carthy had wished or contemplated, will soon become
      sufficiently evident. What kind of sport they had, or whether successful
      or otherwise, it is not our present purpose to say. Be the game abundant
      or scarce, we leave them to pursue it, and request the reader to accompany
      us in a direction somewhat removed, but not very far different from
      theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be necessary, however, to state here previously, that these
      mountains are remarkably&mdash;indeed proverbially&mdash;subject to deep,
      impervious mists, which wrap them in a darkness far more impenetrable to
      the eye than the darkest nights, and immeasurably more confounding to the
      reason, by at once depriving the individual whom they chance to overtake,
      of all sense of his relative position. At night the moon and stars may be
      seen, or even a fire or other light at a distance; but here, whilst
      enveloped in one of those dark and dismal fogs, no earthly object is seen
      within two yards of you, and every step made is replete with doubt or
      danger, and frequently with death itself, in the shape of deep shoreless
      lakes and abrupt precipices. The night had now set in for about two hours,
      and one of the deep fogs which we have just described began to break into
      broad gray fragments, which were driven by the wind into the deeper
      hollows, dissipated almost at once into the thin and invisible air.
      Sometimes a rush of wind would sweep along like a gigantic arrow, running
      through the mist, and leaving a rapid track behind it like a pathway.
      Sometimes again a whirl-blast would sweep round a hill, or rush up from a
      narrow gorge, carrying round, in wild and fantastic gyrations, large
      masses of the apparently solid mist, giving thus to the scene such an
      appearance as would lead the spectator to suppose that some invisible
      being or beings, of stupendous power, were engaged in these fearful
      solitudes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night, we have said, had set in, and the mist was clearing, or had
      altogether cleared away. Up far in these mountains lived a herd, or
      caretaker and gamekeeper, all in one, named Frank Finnerty. He was a man
      of bad character&mdash;gloomy, sullen, and possessed of very little
      natural feeling. The situation in which he resided was so remote and
      solitary, so far from the comforts and conveniences that are derived from
      human intercourse, that scarcely any other man in the parish could be
      induced to undertake the duties attached to it, or consent to live in it
      at all. Finnerty, however, was a dark, unsocial man, who knew that he was
      not liked in the country, and who, on his part, paid back to society its
      hatred of him with interest. He had been engaged in many outrages against
      the law, and had been once sentenced to transportation for manslaughter&mdash;a
      sentence which would have been carried into effect were it not for a point
      made m his case by the lawyer who defended him&mdash;His wife was a
      kind-hearted, benevolent woman naturally, but she had been for years so
      completely subdued and disjointed, that she was, at the period we write
      of, a poor, passive, imbecile creature, indifferent to everything, and
      with no more will of her own than was necessary to fulfil the duties of
      mere mechanical existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now near ten o'clock; Finnerty and she had been sitting at the fire
      in silence for some time, when at length she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I hope there was no one out on the mountains in that mist."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," said he, "what is it to you or me whether there was or not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's thrue," she replied, "but one wouldn't like any harm to come to a
      fellow-creature."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me," he exclaimed, in harsh tones of hatred and irony, "how fond you
      are of your fellow-cratures to-night! little your fellow-cratures care
      about you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, indeed, I suppose that's thrue enough, Frank; what 'ud make them
      care about me or the likes o' me, and for all that whether they may think
      o' me now, I remimber the time when they did care about me, and when I was
      loved and respected by all that knew me."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a touching humility, and a feeble but heart-broken effort at
      self-respect in the poor woman's words and manner that were pitiful and
      pathetic to the last degree, and which even Finnerty himself was obliged
      to acknowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But where's the use of thinking about these things now," he replied; "it
      isn't what we were then, Vread, but what we are now, that we ought to
      think of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, sure, Frank," said the simple-minded creature, "one cannot prevint
      the memory from, goin' back to the early times, when we wor happy, and
      when the world was no trouble to us."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, and after a little she added, "I dunna is the night
      clearin'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Finnerty rose, and proceeding to the door, looked out a moment, then went
      to the corner of the house to get a better view of the sky, after which he
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The mist is gone," he observed, "from the mountains, and I suppose the
      boys will soon begin to come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Throth, Frank," she replied, "I hate these nightly meetin's that you
      hould here&mdash;all this plottin' and plannin' isn't nor can't be good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You hate them! an' who the ould diaoul cares whether you do or not? I
      allow them this house to meet in, bekaise it's large and far from the
      polis. A house down in the country, where they might pop in on them,
      wouldn't be so safe; here, however, no one would suspect them of meetin',
      and from the way the house is situated, no one could come upon us widout
      bein' known or seen. You hate! that indeed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' what do they meet for, Frank? if it's a fair question!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not a fair question, an' you have no business to ax; still if you
      want to know, and if it can make you anything the wiser, you shall hear.
      It's to break a Millstone they meet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To brake a millstone, <i>inngh!</i> Oh, sorra a word of that I believe.
      Sure there's no millstone here?&mdash;if you want to break millstones you
      must go farther up&mdash;to Carnmore, where they make them. Sorra
      millstone's here, I know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know&mdash;oh, how much you know! I tell you, there's a great
      Millstone that covers and grinds the whole kingdom, or at least the
      greatest parts of it&mdash;that's the Millstone we want to brake, and that
      we will brake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When did you hear from Mark Ratigan, or see him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mark Ratigan is snug and comfortable as a laborin' boy wid Magistrate
      Driscol that's in&mdash;hem&mdash;but listen to me, now if you should meet
      Mark anywhere down the country, you're neither to call him Mark nor
      Ratigan, otherwise you may be the manes of hangin' the poor boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Throth, an' by all accounts, he'll come to the gallows yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, and many a betther man did. I expect him and Hourigan both here
      tonight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' what name does he go by now?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the name of Phil Hart; and remember when there's any stranger present,
      you're never to call him anything else&mdash;but above all things, and
      upon the peril of your life, never call him Mark Ratigan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you think," replied his wife, "that I won't take care not to do
      it? But, Frank, tell me what was Mogue Moylan doin' here the night before
      last?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only to let me know that he and a Misthor M'Carthy&mdash;a great friend
      of his and of two good creatures&mdash;Magistrate Driscol and Procthor
      Purcel&mdash;wor to come out shootin' on the mountains to-day and to ax if
      I would prevent them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' did you give them lave?" she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very peculiar expression passed over the dark grim features of her
      husband. "Did I give them lave?" he replied; "well, indeed, you may take
      your davy, I did. Why would I refuse a dacent gintleman, and a friend of
      Mogue Moylan's lave to shoot? Poor dacent Mogue, too, that loves thruth
      and religion so well&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&mdash;whisht!&mdash;here's some
      one."
    </p>
    <p>
      The words were scarcely uttered, when our friends, M'Carthy and Mogue,
      made their appearance in the caretaker's house, both evidently in a
      fatigued state, especially M'Carthy, who had not been so well accustomed
      to travel over mountain scenery as his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, blessed be God that we have got the roof of a house over us at
      last!" exclaimed Mogue. "Frank Finnerty, how are you? an' Vread, achora,
      not forgettin' you&mdash;my hand to you both, but we're lost&mdash;especially
      this gentleman, Mr. M'Carthy&mdash;a great friend of Mr. O'Driscol's and
      Procthor Parcel's&mdash;but a betther man than either o' them, I hope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am fairly knocked up, I admit," said M'Carthy&mdash;"in fact, I am more
      jaded than I ever was in my life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take a chair, sir," said Finnerty; "you are welcome at all events, and I
      am glad to see you, or any friend of Mogue's; take this chair, sir&mdash;and&mdash;here,
      Mogue, do you take a stool; you must be both in a sad state, sure enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Frank," replied Mogue, "oh, then, bad cess to it for a dirty
      mist&mdash;God pardon me for cursin' the poor mist though, for sure it
      wasn't it's fault, the crathur of a mist we oughn't to curse anything that
      God has made, but indeed I'm a great sinner that way, God forgive me;
      howandever as I was sayin', only for it afther all, Mr. Francis, it's
      atin' your comfortable dinner, or rayther drinkin' your fine wine you'd be
      now at Mr. Purcel's illigant table, instead of bein' here as you are,
      however, sure it's good to have a house over our heads any way."
    </p>
    <p>
      Finnerty and his wife heaped more turf on the fire, and the poor woman,
      with that kind spirit of hospitality and sympathy for which her
      countrywomen are so remarkable, told them that they must necessarily be
      hungry, and said she would lose no time in providing them with
      refreshment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Many thanks," replied M'Carthy, "it is not refreshment, but rest we
      require; we have had more refreshments of every kind with us than he could
      use, and it is well we were so provident, otherwise we never would or
      could have reached even this house alive. Such a day I have never spent&mdash;we
      have done nothing but wade through this d&mdash;d mist for the last six or
      eight hours, without the slightest knowledge of whereabout we were."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, Mr. Francis, sure it's one comfort that we're safe at all
      events," said Mogue; "only I'm frettin' myself about the onaisiness
      they'll all feel at home, I mane in Mr. Purcel's, about you. Do you know
      now, that a thought strikes me, sir; I'm fresher than you are a good.
      deal. Now what if I'd run home and make their minds aisy in the first
      place, and get Jerry Joyce to bring the car up for you as far as the
      mountain road? You can rest yourself here in the manetime, and Frank
      Finnerty will see you safe that far. I'll carry the gun and things with me
      too&mdash;so that you'll have a lighter tramp down the hills."
    </p>
    <p>
      This arrangement was precisely what M'Carthy could have wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Mogue, for thinking of this&mdash;you are a considerate kind
      fellow, and I cordially admit that I owe my life to you this day. Had you
      not been with me I must have lost my way and perished in the mountains."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mogue and Finnerty exchanged glances, which, however, did not escape the
      observation of the wife, who thoroughly understood those changes of
      expression, which reflected her husband's darker and sterner purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, then, Misther Frank, that I may be happy but I am glad I was with
      you, so I am, for indeed only for me I don't think, sure enough, that ever
      you'd see this house to-night. There's some spirits left here still, and
      as I'm for another stretch, I don't think a glass of it will do me, or for
      that matther, Frank Finnerty here, any harm. You can see me down the hills
      a piece, Frank; and you, Mr. Francis, might throw yourself on the bed a
      while, and get an hour's sleep or so."
    </p>
    <p>
      This too was agreed to&mdash;Mogue and Finnerty took each a glass of
      whiskey, as did Mrs. Finnerty, by permission of her husband, and in a few
      minutes she and M'Carthy were left by themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the two worthies had been gone a few minutes, she proceeded to the
      door, and as the night had now become tolerably light, she looked out, but
      with a great deal of caution. At first she saw no person, but in walking
      in the shadow of the house, along! the sidewall to the left, she was able
      to observe five or six persons coming towards her husband and Moylan in a
      body; she saw that they stopped and were in close conversation, pointing
      frequently towards the house as they spoke. She returned to M'Carthy with
      the same caution, and, approaching him, was about to speak, when dread of
      her husband supervened for the moment, and she paused like a person in
      doubt. The peculiar glare and the satanic smile which her husband gave to
      Mogue, who, by the way, seemed perfectly to understand it, oppressed her
      with an indistinct sense of approaching evil which she could neither shake
      off, nor separate from the strange gentleman to whom their glances
      evidently referred. She remembered also to have heard her husband say upon
      one occasion when he was drunk, that Mogue Moylan was the deepest villain
      in the barony&mdash;ay, or in the kingdom; and that only for his cowardice
      he would be a man after his own heart. 'Twas true, she knew that he had
      contradicted all this afterwards when he got sober, and said it was the
      liquor that caused him to speak as he did, that Mogue was a good
      kind-hearted crature, who loved truth, and was one of the most religious
      boys among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, however, did not satisfy her; the impression of some meditated evil
      against their temporary guest was too strong to be disregarded, and on
      recollecting that Mogue had been up with her husband only the evening but
      one before, as if to prepare him for something unusual, the conviction
      arose to an alarming height.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have said that this woman was a poor passive creature, whose life was a
      mere round of almost mechanical action. This, to be sure, so far as
      regarded her own domestic duties, and in general every matter in which her
      husband's opinions and her own could clash, was perfectly true. She was
      naturally devoid, however, of neither heart nor intellect, when any of her
      fellow-creatures happened to come within the range of her husband's enmity
      or vengeance, as well as upon other occasions too, and it was well known
      that she had given strong proofs of this. Her life in general appeared to
      be one long lull, but, notwithstanding its quietude, there was, under
      circumstances of crime or danger, the brooding storm ready to start up
      into action.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," said she, on returning into the house, "I'm a plain and ignorant
      woman, so that you needn't feel surprised or alarmed at anything I am
      goin' to say. I hope you will pardon me, sir, when I ax if you seen my
      husband before, or if you know him either more or less?"
    </p>
    <p>
      M'Carthy did feel surprised, and replied in the negative to both points of
      her question&mdash;"I do not know your husband," he said, "nor have I to
      my knowledge ever seen him until to-night; may I beg to inquire why you
      ask?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not worth your while," she replied, "it was a mere thought that came
      into my head: but you and Mogue Moylan never had a dispute, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what can put such a notion into your head, my good woman? Certainly
      not. Mogue and I have been always on the best of terms."
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused again for some minutes, after which, she said, in a voice not
      audible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's something in the wind for all that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir." she proceeded, "you'll think me odd, but will you let me ax if you
      wor ever threatened or put on your guard, of if you know of any enemy you
      have that would wish to injure you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      M'Carthy now started, and, looking at her with a gaze of equal curiosity
      and astonishment, replied, "Your language, my good woman, is beyond doubt
      very strange&mdash;why do you ask me these questions?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Answer me first, if you plaise," she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have certainly been put on my guard," he returned, "and informed that I
      ought to be cautious, for that I had an enemy and that danger was before
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When, and in what way did this happen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall make no further communication on the subject," he replied, "until
      you speak more plainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," she proceeded, "I'm afeard there's danger over you this night, if
      God hasn't said it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not, I trust, while I am under the protection of your husband and Mogue
      Moylan."
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. "If you haven't something better to depend upon, I
      wouldn't think myself overly safe; but you didn't answer the last question
      I axed you. How wor you warned, and who warned you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He then gave her a brief account of the rencounter he had with the
      Whiteboys, and alluded to the unknown but friendly individual who had put
      him on his guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew it," she exclaimed, "I knew it; I couldn't mistake the look that
      passed between them. Now, in God's name," she said, "if you're able to
      drag a limb afther you at all, start out o' this and save yourself, and,
      let what will happen, I entreat, for the love of God, that you won't
      mention my name."
    </p>
    <p>
      This he faithfully promised; "But," replied he to her warning, "I really
      am not able to escape, and I cannot think that your husband would injure a
      man who never offended him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that's not the way they do sich things; it's not the man you offended
      that will injure you, but some blackguard stranger that he gets to do it
      for him, and that you'll know nothing about. In God's name, I say, be off
      out o' this. Even as a stranger you can hardly be safe, and if you wish to
      know why, whisper," and she spoke so low as only barely to be heard,
      "there's a meeting of Whiteboys to be here to-night; anyhow, you're the
      friend of O'Driscol and Procthor Purcel, and that same would be enough to
      make them give you a knock. Don't face home," said she, "or you'll be
      likely to meet them, but take the mountains wanst more on your head. Get
      out upon the road at Altanaveenan and you may be safe. God of Glory!" she
      exclaimed, "here they are&mdash;but watch my face and be guided by me&mdash;here,
      throw yourself into that bed below and pretend to sleep&mdash;I'll do what
      woman can, but I'm afeared we lost our chance."
    </p>
    <p>
      M'Carthy distinctly heard them laughing as they approached the door, and,
      in accordance with the advice he had got, he went to the lower part of the
      house and lay down on the bed, where he closed his eyes and breathed like
      one asleep. He now began to investigate Mogue's conduct, in persisting to
      bring him by so circuitous a sweep such a distance out of his way, and
      decidedly contrary to his wishes. He hesitated, however, to inculpate
      Mogue, who certainly could not have anticipated or brought on the fog,
      which had occasioned them to wander for such a length of time among the
      mountains. Then, on the other hand, he deprived him of his gun and
      ammunition, but might not that also have been from motives of kindness?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, eight or ten men came into the house each and all with
      their faces blackened, and some of them as before wearing shirts outside
      their dress; and this he could see from the position of the bed where he
      lay. The chat among themselves and with Mrs. Finnerty was not, as is the
      case in romances, either mysterious or awful. On the contrary, it was
      light and pleasant, and by no means calculated to heighten McCarthy's
      fears; who, to say truth, however, although resolute and full of courage,
      would as lief been spending the evening with his friend the proctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Vread," said one of them, "any news in the mountains?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "News in the mountains!" exclaimed Vread, "well, indeed, that's good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any deaths or marriages among the grouse, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Vread, as we have said, had got a glass of spirits, a circumstance which,
      to a low heart but a kind one like hers, may probably have accounted for a
      portion of her energy, as well as of her sympathy with the apprehended
      danger to M'Carthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Troth," she replied, with more vivacity than might have been expected
      from her, "when you spake to a dacent woman it ought to be with a clane
      face at any rate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Vread, how can you say it's dirty," replied the fellow, "when you
      know I washed it before I came out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must be in the divil's basin, then," she replied, "for if one can
      judge by their eyes, you're more like one of his childre than your honest
      father's, whoever he was or is. Troth, I'm afeard it's a dirty business
      you're; all about to-night, if a body is to take you by your looks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, then," observed another, "who 'ud think that poor die-away Vread had
      so much spunk in her? Vread," he proceeded, "you must a been a great
      beauty wanst upon a time; a very purty face you had, they say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever it was," she replied, "I thank God I was never ashamed to show
      it like too many of my neighbors."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be too sure that we're your neighbors, Vread."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Troth, I hope not," she returned; "I don't think my neighbors 'ud be
      consarned in sich disgraceful work, as I'm afraid brings yez out. Faugh
      upon you all! its unmanly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband, accompanied by six or eight more, now made his appearance; a
      circumstance which at once put an end to the part that his wife was
      disposed to bear in their conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other chat of various character then took place, in which, however,
      M'Carthy, who now watched them closely, could observe that they did not
      all join.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whisht," said one of them, "is there anybody asleep in the house? I think
      I hear some one snorin!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is," said Finnerty, "a gentleman that was out shootin' to-day wid a
      servant-man of Mr. Parcel's the procthor&mdash;named Mogue Moylan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a very great scoundrel is Mogue Moylan," said one of them, with a
      wink at the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, no," said Finnerty, "I think not&mdash;poor Mogue's a daecnt, quiet
      crature, and has a great regard for truth and religion."
    </p>
    <p>
      M'Carthy, from his position the bed, had, by means of a fortunate rift in
      the blankets, a complete view of the whole party, and he could mark with
      accuracy, in consequence of their black faces, every grin now made
      distinctly visible by their white teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is the gentleman that snores so beautifully?" asked another of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is a gentleman named O'Connor," replied poor Vread, anxious, if
      possible, even at the risk of much subsequent abuse and ill-treatment, to
      conceal his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay," said Finnerty, corroborating her; much, indeed, to her astonishment,
      "he is a Mr. O'Connor, I believe, a very handsome-lookin', fine young
      fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What the blazes," said another of them, "keeps him? Surely he ought to be
      here before now. Had Mr. O'Connor good sport?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How could he," replied Finnerty, "wid the fog that was on the mountains?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment an individual made his appearance, whom it was impossible
      to look upon without being most forcibly struck by his figure. He was a
      broad-shouldered, muscular, powerful man, with immensely large limbs; his
      hair was black, and a huge pair of whiskers of the same color stretched
      across his cheeks, met at his chin, and ran down in an unbroken line round
      a huge and remarkably well-set neck. The moment he entered, and before he
      had time to speak, two or three of them instantly placed their fingers
      significantly upon their lips, as if to indicate silence, apprehensive, as
      M'Carthy at the time thought, lest his voice might be recognised. Another
      of them then whispered something to him, and whatever the secret was, it
      caused him to glance for a moment, and involuntarily, towards the bed. All
      that he spoke afterwards was uttered in whispers.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.&mdash;The Sport Continued.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Finnerty's house, which had been built for more purposes than were
      necessary for the accommodation of a caretaker or gamekeeper, was simply a
      plain apartment, tolerably large, with room enough in it for a couple of
      beds; to this was added a shooting-lodge for the owner of the mountains,
      which consisted of three or four bed-rooms opening from a well-sized
      dining-room, and a kitchen distinct from the apartment which constituted
      the dwelling of the gamekeeper, being that which Finnerty, as such, then
      occupied. It was in the dining-room of the shooting-lodge that the
      Whiteboy meetings were uniformly held, although of late it had been usual
      for those who attended them to sit in Finnerty's house until the hour had
      arrived for commencing business, when they adjourned to the other. We
      should say that the gamekeeper's house, though under the same roof, as it
      is termed, with the shooting-lodge, was distinct from it in other
      respects; that is to say, there was no internal communication between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who was that fellow that we met with you a while ago?" asked one of them
      a second time, as if having forgotten his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Mogue Moylan," replied Finnerty, "and sadly bate down he was wid
      this day's Work; I advised him to go to bed as soon as he could, and
      refresh himself by a good sleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Advise!" said a voice, that almost made M'Carthy start, "it's aisier to
      give good advice than it is to take it; Mogue's not the only fool in this
      world that won't take good advice when it's given."
    </p>
    <p>
      There could be no mistaking his voice. M'Carthy at once recognized that of
      the unknown friend who had warned him of danger on the night he
      encountered the Whiteboys, as already described.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come," proceeded he, "it is time we should commence business and settle
      the affairs of the nation at wanst; throth," he added, with a laugh, "if I
      was the same nation, and had a pair of good legs undher me&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of what?" said the person with the black whiskers, who was evidently
      their leader, "of what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of ginerals like Bonnypart and Sarsfield, I'd soon have the country clear
      and the millstone pavin' the roads under our feet, as it will be before
      long, plaise God. Come, then, to business."
    </p>
    <p>
      They accordingly proceeded to the adjoining house, with the exception of
      Finnerty himself, who, whether for the sake of safety, or rather for the
      purpose of watching M'Carthy, remained at his own fireside. His wife, on
      seeing this, pretended to be engaged with some domestic matter about the
      dresser, on which she placed a freshly lit rushlight, and availing herself
      of her position behind the back of her husband, who sat with his face
      towards the bed, she slightly raised her hands and eyes, as if to intimate
      that escape, she feared, was impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is incredible, the reaction which a new sensation, especially of joy or
      terror, or, indeed, of any feeling that is strong, superinduces upon the
      spirit, under circumstances of peculiar danger or interest. M'Carthy's
      fatigue, for instance, had now as completely departed from him as if he
      had not been abroad that day, and in consequence of the significant hint
      which he had received through the voice of his mysterious friend, he felt
      that if an opportunity were only offered him he would use the two legs to
      which his friend had alluded, when checked by the stern voice of their
      leader, with as much agility as ever they possessed during his life. It
      was this hint which made him feel certain, for the first time, that he was
      in imminent danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour had now elasped, and it was evident, from the listening
      attitudes and frequent stortings of Finnerty, that the debate in the lodge
      was high and serious. At length, one of the society hurriedly made his
      appearance, exclaiming; in a kind of condensed and agitated whisper, "Come
      in and help us&mdash;they won't stand the thing, there's only three for
      us." Finnerty took the candle; and, after signing to the person to go out,
      brought it close to M'Carthy's eyes, who opened his mouth and assumed with
      singular success all the deep insensible relaxation which characterizes
      heavy sleep. Finnerty even shook him, and said, "Hadn't you better get up,
      sir, and come to meet the car?" He addressed a log, however, and after
      another more careless and evidently satisfied glance, he laid down the
      candle, and then said to his wife, in a whisper, which, however, M'Carthy
      could hear; "The moment he wakens let us know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vread, who would not seem to attach any importance to the circumstance,
      simply nodded, by way of acquiescence, and her husband, went to join those
      in the lodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      In every country whose political, commercial, or social relations, are not
      properly settled, or in which there exists a struggle between the
      principles at variance with civil order and those of enlightened progress,
      there will always be found a considerable portion of the population ripe
      and ready for violence and crime. This is an undisputable fact, and one
      the more dangerous too, inasmuch as crime is usually stripped by these
      misguided wretches of its inherent guilt, and looked upon as a necessary
      instrument, or, in other words, as a means to work out an end. It is true,
      the relative portion of the reckless and guilty is, in this country at
      least, considering its population, exceedingly small, for we all know how
      miserable the number of those who are at any time necessary to involve the
      character of a district at large, or inculpate the moral reputation of a
      whole country. At the same time, we must unquestionably admit, that, if we
      contrast the population of the country at large, and the frequency of
      crime in it, joined to its character of cool and deliberate atrocity, with
      that of the sister countries, we must candidly acknowledge, that the
      conduct of the people, even taking the proportions I have mentioned into
      consideration, is not only without parallel in modern times, but that
      religion is not merely a name, but, in every sense, incapable, whether by
      its internal spirit or maladministration, of discharging to society those
      great functional duties which mankind have a right to expect from it. But
      now to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finnerty had joined the meeting; his wife, approaching M'Carthy, said, in
      a low whisper&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "They have some argument about you, whatever it is. However, with God's
      assistance, I'll venthur to do a thing that may be dangerous enough to
      myself, at any rate; but what do I care about that, if I can save an
      unoffendin' fellow-creature from harm?&mdash;Stay where you are then, till
      I come in again."
    </p>
    <p>
      She went out as she spoke, and after an? interval of about six or eight
      minutes again made her appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't hear them plain enough," she said, on her return, "but whatever
      it is, I can undherstan' that the most of them all is against it. In God's
      name, at any rate, stay where you are&mdash;they're risin' to go home, and
      as the night's light they'd be sure to pounce upon you if you attempted to
      escape. Whatever I can do to save you from harm here I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor woman's escape from detection, while performing the friendly
      office of listening, was indeed very narrow. Short and hurried as her last
      advice to M'Carthy was, the words in which she conveyed it had scarcely
      been uttered, when her husband, accompanied by three persons, their faces
      still blackened, made his appearance. They took seats in silence around
      the fire, and one of them, handing over a bottle of whiskey to Finnerty,
      merely nodded, as much as to say, pass that about. Finnerty accordingly
      did so, and each of them drank a glass or two, after which they were
      silent as before. This silence, to M'Carthy, began to wear a solemn and a
      fearful aspect, especially as he knew enough of the habits of the people
      to be aware, that in drinking whiskey is often resorted to in order to
      deaden their moral, perceptions, or, in other words, as a stimulant to
      crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, after about a quarter of an hour had elapsed, and three of them&mdash;that
      is to say, two of the strangers and Finnerty&mdash;had each drank three
      glasses of spirits, the fourth, who had taken only one glass, beckoned to
      the other two to follow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think," said he, "they are all gone, and the coast is clear."
    </p>
    <p>
      In this man's voice, M'Carthy, to his infinite delight, once more
      recognized that of his unknown well-wisher. Be this as it may, he and the
      other two left the house, and, as the reader is no doubt interested in
      their movements, we shall permit him to follow them to the dining-room of
      the shooting-lodge, where the meeting had just been held.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, then," he proceeded, "it is so best, as none of us can become
      a traitor against the rest. Shew me your pistols; for, as I'm an ould
      soger, I'll regulate them for you better than you'll be able to do
      yourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      He accordingly took their pistols, examined them closely, fixed the powder
      in the pans, adding' a fresh supply of priming from a little goat's horn
      which he carried in his-pocket. He then took out his own, which he simply
      looked at, and again returned to his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," said he, "our best plan is to take him about the small o' the back,
      when he's before us, one only at a time; you," said he, addressing the
      tallest, "will fire first; you,"&mdash;to the other&mdash;"next if he
      misses him; and, as I'm the boy that doesn't miss my mark, I'll take him
      down, never fear, if he should escape either of you. Come now, let us go
      in and get him to his legs, that we may start."
    </p>
    <p>
      On making their appearance again, Finnerty approached M'Carthy, and
      exclaimed as before, but on this occasion with a loud and earnest voice,
      "Come, sir, get up if you plaise; it's time for you to meet the car." To
      this M'Carthy made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, sir," repeated Finnerty, "bounce; hillo, I say, Mr. M'Carthy; up
      wid you, sir, the car will be waitin' for you;" and he gave him a slap on
      the shoulder as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo!" exclaimed the pretended sleeper, "have a care&mdash;easy,' easy&mdash;what's
      that? who are you?&mdash;eh&mdash;aw&mdash;oh, dear me, where am I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a friend's house, sir; get up, you know Mr. Purcel's car is waitin'
      for you at the mountain road below."
    </p>
    <p>
      M'Carthy started to his feet, and on looking about him, exclaimed, "How is
      this, Finnerty? why are the faces of these men blackened?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never you mind that, sir," replied Finnerty, "they are two or three poor
      fellows that's on their keepin' in regard to havin' paid their tithes
      against the will o' the people; an' they don't wish to be known, that's
      all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," replied M'Carthy, "that's their own affair, and neither yours nor
      mine, Finnerty. Come, then, are you ready? for I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "These boys, Mr. M'Carthy, has promised to take the best care of you while
      in their company, an' as they're goin' to the mountain road, where your're
      to meet the car, they'll bring you safe, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most certainly not, Finnerty," replied the other; "I shall be escorted by
      no person or persons ashamed to show their faces. If you refuse to come,
      you break your word with me; but, in any event, I shall not travel with
      these men. I am too well aware of the disturbed state of the country, and
      that, being a friend of Mr. Purcel, I may not be popular. I consider
      myself, however, under your protection and under the protection of your
      roof, and for this reason I shall hold you accountable for my safety; and,
      at all events, unless you insist on expelling me, I shall remain where I
      am until morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, if you insist upon it, I'll go," replied Finnerty, and four friends
      about you will be betther and safer than one; but in troth, to tell you
      the truth, Mr. M'Carthy, I'm a'most fairly knocked up myself, havin' been
      down the counthry and through the hills the greater part of the day. I
      have a great number of cattle to look afther, an' am seldom off my foot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't, sir," said his wife, in tones which were now perfectly
      intelligible to him, "don't ax poor Frank to go wid you tonight; you'll be
      as well widout him, especially as the night's so bright and clear; he's
      tired indeed, and, be the same token, I don't like to be here in the
      clouds of the night, wid nobody wid me but myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you're a gentlemen, sir," said the friendly voice, "you won't take
      this honest man from his wife at such an hour o' the night. If you take my
      advice too, I'd recommend you to come along wid ourselves at wanst."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no mistaking the friendly voice embodied in these words, as well
      as in those of Mrs. Finnerty. M'Carthy accordingly replied:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very, well, Finnerty, I will proceed with these men. I should indeed be
      sorry to cause you any additional fatigue, or to fetch you from your house
      at such an hour. I will therefore put myself under the protection and
      guidance of these worthy fellows, who, I hope, will remember that although
      a friend to Mr. Purcel personally, yet I am none to any harshness he may
      have resorted to for the recovery of his tithes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's nobody here," replied the still friendly voice, "inclined to
      offer you any offense, bekaise you happen to be a friend to Mr. Purcel"&mdash;and
      there was a marked emphasis laid upon the name&mdash;"so now," the voice
      proceeded, "you may make your mind aisy on that head."
    </p>
    <p>
      A singular but significant laugh proceeded, from the other two, which,
      however, was repressed by a glance from "the friend," who said, "Come,
      boys, turn out; now, sir, the sooner we get over this journey the
      betther."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Finnerty," said M'Carthy, "many thanks for the hospitable shelter
      of your house, and to you also, Mrs. Finnerty, for your kindness and the
      trouble I have occasioned you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Finnerty's voice had now nearly abandoned her; and, as our young
      sportsman, after having shaken hands with her husband, now paid that
      compliment to herself, he perceived that the poor creature's hand was
      literally passive and cold as ice, whilst the words she attempted to utter
      literally died away unspoken on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having got about a mile from the house, his unknown friend began to become
      loquacious, and related several anecdotes of successful escape from the
      meshes and minions of the law, a theme in which his two companions seemed
      to take singular delight; for they laughed immoderately at every recorded
      victory in outwitting the legal functionaries aforesaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was wanst upon a time," he proceeded, "taken up for a resky; (* a
      rescue) the case bein' you see, that we wanted the rent and the landlord
      wanted patience; so begad, at any rate, we gev the bloody bailiffs a
      thrifle for themselves, and the consequence was that we brought the cows
      back to a neighbor's place that belonged to another property, and the four
      bailiffs, poor creatures, lay upon the ground lookin' at us, an' never
      said ill we did it, for a raison they had; do you undherstand, boys?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, we do undherstand; the bloddy thieves; divil break his neck that
      invinted rint, anyhow; sure there's no harm in wishin' that, the villain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, an' tides," (* Tithes) replied the other; "however, we'll settle that
      first, and then the rents will soon follow them; an' sure there's no harm
      in that aither."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well an' good:&mdash;no, divil a harm's in it;&mdash;well an' good: to
      make a long story short, they grabbed me in a house up in the mountains&mdash;not
      unlike Finnerty's, I think that's his name&mdash;where I was on my
      keepin'; so what 'ud you have of it, but we were comin' acrass the hills,
      jist as it might be said we are now&mdash;only there's none of us a
      prisoner, thank goodness&mdash;hem! Well, I said to myself, hit or miss,
      I'll thry it; I have a pair o' legs, an' it won't be my fault or I'll put
      them to the best use: an' for that raison it'll be divil take the hindmost
      wid us. Now listen, boys; I started off, an' one fellow that had a pistol
      let bang at me, but long life to the pistol, divil a one of it would go
      off; bang again came the other chap's, but 'twas ditto repaited, and no go
      any more than the other. Well, do you know now, that the third fellow&mdash;for
      there was only three af them, I must tell you&mdash;the third fellow, I'm
      inclined to think, was a friend at bottom; for the devil a one of him
      struv to break his heart in overtakin' me. Well, by that manes, I say, I
      got off from two of as double-distilled villains as ever wor born to die
      by suspin-sion."
    </p>
    <p>
      This narrative, the spirit of which was so acceptable to his two
      companions, and, if truth must be told, equally so to the third, was
      treasured up by M'Carthy, who felt that it ingeniously but cautiously
      pointed out to him the course he should adopt under his own peculiar
      circumstances. The consequence was, that on coming within about a couple
      of furlongs of a dark, narrow, thickly-wooded glen, through which he knew
      they must pass, he bolted off at the top of his speed, which, although
      very considerable for a man whose strength had been so completely
      exhausted by fatigue and the unusual slavery of that day's wandering
      through the mountains, was, notwithstanding, such as would never have
      enabled him to escape from his companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not gone a perch when the click of a pistol was heard, but no
      report; the fact having been, that the pistol missed fire, and did not go
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "D&mdash;n your blood!" exclaimed the "friend" to the other, "fire, and
      don't let him escape;" the ruffian did so when click No. 2 was heard, but
      as before no report.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aisy," said the fellow who had fired first, pulling out a long Spanish
      dagger; "an inch or two of this is as safe as a bullet, any day; and by
      japers he won't escape it." He sprang after M'Carthy as he spoke, followed
      by his companion. The third man stepped a pace or two to the right, and
      levelling a long double-barrelled pistol, deliberately fired, when
      McCarthy's first pursuer fell; the second man, however, with that
      remarkable, quickness of wit which characterizes the Irish, in their
      outrages as well as in their pastimes, suddenly stooped, and taking the
      dreadful dagger out of the hands of the wounded man, continued the pursuit
      bounding after his foe with a spirit of vengeance and ferocity, now raised
      to the highest pitch. The stranger, seeing that M'Carthy was still in
      equal danger if not in still greater, for the now infuriated ruffian was
      gaining upon him, once more levelled his pistol&mdash;fired&mdash;and, as
      before, down came the intended assassin. He himself then sprang forward,
      as if in pursuit of M'Carthy, exclaiming, "Hell and fury, why did yez keep
      between me and him&mdash;I think he's hit; give me that dagger, and I'll
      go bail I'll make his body soon put six inches of it out of sight," and
      having uttered, these words, he rushed forward, as if in pursuit of their
      victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he had left them, the following brief dialogue took place between
      these two worthies:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hourigan, blazes to me but I'm shot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hell's perdition to the unlucky villain&mdash;so am I&mdash;where are you
      shot, Mark?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By japers, the blood's pourin' out from me in the thigh, an' I'm afeard
      I'm done for&mdash;blast his unlucky hand, the villain; I wisht I had my
      dagger in him. Where are you shot, Darby?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, vo&mdash;vo&mdash;on the right hip&mdash;but&mdash;oh, sweet Jasus,
      what will become of us if we're to die here&mdash;may the devil clap his
      cruibs (* Talons; claws) in the sowl of him that done it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amin, I pray the blessed Saviour this night! Do you think, Darby, he was
      a traitor, and done it a purpose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mavrone, oh!&mdash;if I die widout the priest, what 'ud become o' me,
      an' all the sins I have to answer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, was the villain a traitor, do you think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mavrone, oh!&mdash;blessed Lord forgive me&mdash;well&mdash;I can hardly
      think so&mdash;didn't he volunteer along wid yourself an' myself&mdash;oh,
      sweet Jasus! what a life I lead&mdash;oh, Mark Ratigan, Mark Ratigan, what
      will become o' me!&mdash;-I swore away the lives of two innocent men&mdash;I
      proved three alibis for three of as black villains as ever stretched a
      rope or charged a blunderbush! 'Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be
      thy name, thy kingdom come'&mdash;oh, Lord! forbid that yet a while! could
      you join in a <i>Leadhan wurrah?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blast you, you thick-headed vagabone! don't you know it's wrong to call
      me Mark Ratigan&mdash;isn't Phil Hart my name now?&mdash;no, I tell you,
      that I can't join you in a <i>Leadhan wurrah</i>&mdash;nor I didn't think
      you wor such a d&mdash;d cowardly hound as you are&mdash;can't you die&mdash;if
      you're goin' to die&mdash;like a man, an' not like an ould woman? Be my
      sowl, Darby, my boy, afther this night I'll never trust you again. It's
      yourself that 'ud turn traitor on your country and her cause, if you got
      the rope and hangman at your nose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Holy Mary, mother of God! pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our
      death, amin! Oh, sweet Jasus! have parsecution on me this night, an' spare
      me if it's your blessed will, till I get time to repint properly anyhow.
      Mark, darlin', are you gettin' waker, for I am?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To blazes wid you, and don't bother me&mdash;no, I'm not&mdash;I've tied
      my handkerchy about the place I was shot in, an' stopped the blood&mdash;eh&mdash;here&mdash;well
      done, Mark&mdash;hem&mdash;Phil Hart, I mane&mdash;bravo&mdash;see&mdash;that
      now&mdash;instead of bleatin' like a dyin' sheep, I've stopped the blood,
      an' here I am able to stand and walk. Come," said he, approaching his
      companion, "where are you shot?&mdash;let us see?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stooped down, and on examining the Wound by the light of the moon,
      perceived at once that it was not all imagination and evil conscience. He
      consequently forced him to his legs, then bound up the wound with the
      fellow's handkerchief just as he had done his own, and in a few minutes
      they were able to resume their journey, slowly, it is true, and on the
      part of Ratigan, whose wound was the more serious, with a good deal of
      difficulty and pain, notwithstanding his hardihood.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, M'Carthy was soon overtaken by the friendly Whiteboy,
      whose speed; of foot was indeed extraordinary. On seeing, the dagger in
      his pursuer's hand&mdash;for such he deemed him to be&mdash;he had
      prepared himself for resistance, the fact being, than in consequence of
      their blackened faces, and the state of perturbation and excitement in
      which he felt himself, he was in no condition to recognize any of the
      party unless by their voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be alarmed," exclaimed the stranger, approaching him, "I have saved
      your life for this night most likely, by takin' the, life of them that
      intended to murder you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I certainly feel," replied M'Carthy, "that I owe my life to you, and I
      know not what return I can make you for it. But why should I speak so,
      since I am ignorant of your name, as well as of everything whatsoever
      concerning you? As to the other two persons, I cannot understand why they
      should attempt to murder me, as I am not conscious of having given offence
      to, any person."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have never given offence to them," replied the stranger; "but
      unfortunately this, part of the country's in such a state of feelin' at
      the present time, that it's as aisy to find one man to murdher another as
      it would be to get a man to shoot a dog. No, sir; you never offended these
      men, but they were set on to take your life by a man who hates you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, since you have been on more than one occasion so generous to me,
      can you not let me know who that person is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir; that man has a hundred&mdash;ay, ten hundred eyes through the
      counthry&mdash;in the shape of spies&mdash;and five times as many hands
      any time he may wish for them. You may thank a friend of yours for sendin'
      me to save your life this night. Your family have been friends to him and
      to me too, although you don't know it. As for me, I go with him heart an'
      hand in puttin' down the tithes, but I'll always save the life of a
      friend, if I can; and indeed I have been forced to shoot these two men, in
      ordher to save yours to-night. I must go now and see what state they're in&mdash;whether
      alive or dead; but before. I go, listen:&mdash;tell the procthor that he
      has a fearful account to meet, and that soon; let neither him nor his sons
      be fool-hardy; say to him, that the wisest thing he can do is to remove
      himself and his family into the town of Lisnagola; or, if he won't do
      that, to keep his house half-filled with fire-arms; for I tell you now,
      the time is not long till he'll need them all. Tell them not to go out at
      night at all, or even by day, unless well armed; and do you yourself take
      the same advice; and now good-night. But, listen again: there, you see, is
      the spot below there, where the car was to meet you; but there's no car in
      it, and even if there was, I wouldn't recommend you to go on it; and if
      you're goin' to O'Driscol's don't go up the avenue, but by the back way,
      behind the garden, for it's very likely there's another man&mdash;and a
      fearful man, on the look-out for you, in case you should be missed by us.
      Farewell, for the present."
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes brought this kind-hearted Whiteboy back to the spot where
      Hourigan and his companion, who was also his cousin, fell. He was a good
      deal surprised, but still highly gratified, at not finding them where they
      had fallen, as it was a 'proof to him that his aim at either had not been
      fatal, as he certainly had no intention of taking their lives, or of
      rendering them any greater injury than the infliction of such wound as
      might put an end to their pursuit of M'Carthy. On advancing a little
      farther, he saw them proceeding, by a different but shorter path towards
      the inland country; and being now satisfied, from their appearance, that
      they had not been mortally wounded, he left them to reach home as best
      they might, and proceeded himself in another direction.

      CHAPTER XI.&mdash;The Sport Still Continued.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is necessary to say here, that Moylan had not the slightest intention
      of sending Mr. Purcel's car to meet our friend M'Carthy, inasmuch as he
      never for a moment supposed that this devoted youth was likely to leave
      the mountains alive. His own egregious vanity, engrafted on a cowardly,
      jealous, and malignant disposition, prompted him, ever since he had been
      induced by the pedlar, out of a mere banter, to suppose that he had
      engaged the affections of Julia Purcel, to look upon this young man as a
      person that ought to be got out of his way. In this manner there was,
      indeed, a peculiar combination of circumstances against M'Carthy; for it
      so happened that Moylan, whilst anxious to wreak his own jealousy and
      hatred upon him, was, at the same time, executing the will of another
      individual who stood behind the scenes. On every side, then, M'Carthy was
      surrounded by mortal dangers that were completely veiled in obscurity.
      During this very night it was resolved to assassinate him, be the
      consequences what they might; and if he should escape, in the one
      instance, he was to be sought after in whatever house he took refuge, with
      the exception only of Purcel's, which his enemies were, for the present,
      afraid to attack. Every avenue and road leading to it however, was
      watched, with a hope that if he escaped elsewhere, they might shoot him
      down from, behind a hedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The condition of all secret and illegal societies in Ireland is, indeed,
      shocking and most detestable, when contemplated from any point of view
      whatsoever. In every one of them&mdash;that is, in every local body or
      branch of such conspiracy&mdash;there is a darker and more secret class,
      comparatively few in number, who undertake to organize the commission of
      crimes and outrages; and who, when they are controlled by the
      peaceably-disposed and enemies to bloodshed, always fall back upon this
      private and blood-stained clique, who are always willing to execute their
      sanguinary behests, as it were, <i>con amore</i>. In other cases, however,
      as we have stated before, even the virtuous and reluctant are often
      compelled, by the dark and stern decrees of these desperate ruffians, to
      perpetrate crimes from which they revolt. It was, therefore, in pursuance
      of these abominable principles that the arrangements for M'Carthy's murder
      were made on the night in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerry Joyce perceiving, as he had feared, that M'Carthy did not return to
      dinner, at once came to the determination that he would go to Finnerty's,
      where, from his connection with Whiteboyism, he knew that a meeting of
      them was to be held on that night. He accordingly armed himself with a
      ease of pistols, which he had been allowed to keep for the preservation of
      his master's family and premises, in case they should be attacked. He had
      not gone, however, within two miles of the mountains, when he met Mogue on
      His way home, carrying M'Carthy's, or rather John Purcel's double gun, and
      other shooting gear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Mogue," said he, "how does this come? Where's Mr. M'Carthy from
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! that I may never sin&mdash;but sure I know I will&mdash;for I'm a
      great sinner&mdash;God forgive me!&mdash;but anyhow, that I may never sin,
      if I'm worth the washin'! Oh! Jerry, darlin', sick a killin' day as we had
      I never passed, an' I'm well accustomed to the mountains. Sure, now,
      Jerry, if you have one spunk of common charity in your composition, you'll
      take me up on your back and carry me home, otherwise I'll lie down on the
      road, and either die at wanst or sleep it out till mornin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that's not tellin' me where you left Mr. M'Carthy," replied Jerry,
      whose apprehensions were not at all lessened by this indirect and
      circuitous answer. "Where is he, and what has become of him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of all the mists that ever riz out o' the airth, or fell from the blessed
      heavens above as&mdash;glory be to the name of God! we had it on the
      mountains this whole day. Why, now, Jerry, a happy death to me, but you
      might cut it with a knife, at the very least, an' how we got through it,
      I'm sure, barrin' the Providence of God, I dunna. But indeed we're far
      from bein' worthy of the care He takes of us."
    </p>
    <p>
      While speaking, he had, as an illustration of his fatigue, taken his seat
      upon the grassy ditch, which bounded in the road, and altogether enacted
      the part of a man completely broken down by over-exertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Mogue, my pious creature, you're not tellin' us where you left&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, then, salvation to you, for one Jerry, do you think it's ait him I
      did? Sound asleep in Frank Finnerty's I left him, where he'll be well
      taken care of. Oh! thin, if ever a poor inoffensive young gintleman&mdash;for
      sure he's that by birth, as we say, at all events, as well as by larnin'&mdash;was
      brought to death's door with this day's work, he was. I thought to
      flatther him home if he could come, but it was no go. An' thin, agin, I
      thought it was a sin to ax' him; an' so for a afraid they'd be alarmed at
      home, I was on my way to make all your minds aisy. An' whisper hether,
      Jerry&mdash;not that I look upon Frank Finnerty an the man he ought to be,
      for we all know the narrow escape he had for the murder of Tom Whisky's
      son&mdash;still an' all, he's safe wid Finnerty, bekaise he knows that we
      know where he is, and that if anything happened him we'd hould him
      accountable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," replied Jerry, affecting a satisfaction which, however, he did not
      feel, "I'm glad he's safe; for, as you say, Mogue, although Frank Finnerty
      is pretty well known, still what could tempt him to harm Mr. M'Carthy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that," said Mogue; "still an' all, the nerra foot I'd brought him
      to his house, only we stumbled on it out o' the mist, by mere accident,
      an' by coorse it was the next to us. Goodness' sake, Jerry, carry these
      things home for me, will you? I'm not able to mark the ground&mdash;do,
      avick, an' I'll offer up a pathran avy for you before I lay down my head
      this night, tired as I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, begad, it's myself that would, Mogue, but you see, as I'm out for a
      while, an' so near my poor mother's, throth I'll slip over and see how she
      is, the crature; only for that, Mogue, I'd lighten you of the shootin'
      things wid a heart an' a half."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But sure you can see your poor mother, the crature, any other evenin'? Do
      come back, Jerry, an' I'll do twiste as much for you agin. Oh! oh! milia
      murther! I'm not able to get on my legs. Give me your hand, Jerry&mdash;oh!
      oh!&mdash;well, well&mdash;what's this at all? Jerry, achora, don't desart
      me now, 'an me in the state you see. I'll never get home by myself&mdash;that's
      what I won't&mdash;mavrone, oh! what's this?&mdash;I'm fairly kilt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, but the thruth is, Mogue," replied his companion, "that I got a
      message from my mother, sayin' that she's not well, and wishes most
      partiklarly to see me about my sisther Shibby's marriage. Now, Mogue,
      you're a pious and religious boy, an' would be the last to encourage me to
      neglect a parent's wishes: ay, or that would allow me to do so, even if I
      intended it; throth I know it's a scoulden' you'd give me if I did."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mogue's flank was completely turned; he was, in fact, most adroitly taken
      upon his own principle; his egregious vanity was ticked by this compliment
      to his piety; and, as he was at no time a person of firm character, he
      gave way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thought Jerry to himself, as he left this plausible hypocrite, to proceed
      home under his affected fatigue, "I know there's mischief on foot
      to-night, for if there wasn't I an' others 'ud be summoned to this
      meetin'; there will be nobody there, I suppose, but the black squad or the
      bloodmen. It'll go hard wid me, at any rate, but I'll send one there
      that'll bring Mr. M'Carthy from among them without suspicion; an' so here
      goes to lose no time about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He then plunged into the most solitary and remote fields, and pursued his
      way, anxious, if possible, to meet no one, much less any of those who
      belonged, as he said, "to the black squad."
    </p>
    <p>
      Of late, the state of public feeling upon the subject of tithes had become
      so violent and agitated, that Mr. Purcel's immediate friends found it
      almost a matter involving their personal safety to dine with him. At all
      events, such of them as accepted his hospitality took care to leave his
      house very early, and to keep themselves well armed besides. On the
      evening in question, no one had been invited but M'Carthy and Fergus
      O'Driscol. The heroic magistrate, however, ever since the receipt of the
      threatening letter, would not suffer his son (who certainly participated
      in none of his father's cowardice), to dine abroad at all, lest his
      absence and well-known intrepidity might induce the Whiteboys, or other
      enemies of law, to attack the house when its principal defence was from
      home. The evening, therefore, hung heavy on their heads at Longshot Lodge,
      which was the name of Purcel's residence, especially upon that of the fair
      Julia, who felt not merely disappointed, but unusually depressed' by the
      unaccountable absence of her lover, knowing as she did, the turbulence
      which prevailed in the country. She scarcely ate any dinner, and in the
      course of a short time retired to her own room, which commanded a view of
      the way by which he should approach the house, where she watched, casement
      up, until she heard a foot in the avenue, which, however, her acute ear,
      well accustomed to McCarthy's, soon told her was not that of her lover. On
      looking more closely she perceived, however, that it was Mogue Moylan;
      and, unable to restrain her impatience, she raised the window still
      higher, and called down as Mogue passed under it, on his way round to the
      kitchen, but in a low, earnest voice, with, as Mogue thought, a good deal
      of confidential in it, "Is that Mogue?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh!" he exclaimed, struck almost on the instant into a state of ecstacy;
      "Is that Miss Julia?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Mogue," she replied, in the same low voice, "I do not wish to run
      the risk of speaking to you from this; stay there, and I will go to one of
      the windows of the front parlor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," thought Mogue, "it is come to this at last? oh, thin, but I was a
      blackguard haythen an' nothing else ever to think of you, Letty Lenehan,
      or any low-born miscreant like you. The devil blow her aist, waist, north,
      and south, the flipen' blazes, and to think o' the freedoms she used to
      take wid me, as if she was my aquils; but sure, dam her cribs! whatever I
      intended to do, it wasn't to marry her, an' can I forget, moreover, the
      day she gave me the bloody nose, when I only went to take a small taste o'
      liberty wid the thief."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of a minute or two, Julia made her appearance at the window,
      with, in fact, a blushing face, if it could have only been seen with
      sufficient light. Now that she stood within a couple of yards of Moylan,
      she felt all the awkwardness and embarrassment of the task she had
      undertaken, which was to inquire, without seeming to feel any personal
      interest, as to the cause of her lover's absence. In addition to the
      prevailing agitation, and the outrages arising from if, she had heard of
      so many accidents with sportsmen, so many guns had burst, so many
      explosions had taken place, and so many lives had been lost, that her warm
      fancy pictured his death in almost every variety of way in which a gun
      could occasion it. Owing to all this, she experienced a proportionable
      share of confusion and diffidence in managing her inquiries with proper
      address, and without betraying any suspicion of her motives.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mogue," said she, "I&mdash;hem&mdash;hem&mdash;I hope you don't feel
      fatigued after your sport'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, then, there it comes," thought Mogue; "how the crature feels for me!
      an' even if I did, Miss Julia, sure one kind word when I come home is fit
      to cure it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you are sure to get that, Mogue," replied Julia, who took it for
      granted that he referred to Letty Lenehan, "but whisper," she proceeded,
      still speaking in a low voice, from an apprehension of being heard making
      the proposed inquiries by any of her family, "are you alone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am, indeed, Miss Julia," he replied in a tone of such coaxing and
      significant confidence, as would have been irresistibly laughable had she
      understood why he used it, "I am alone, Miss Julia, and you needn't be
      either ashamed or daunted in sayin' whatever you like to me&mdash;maybe I
      could guess what you're goin' to say, but I declare to you, and that my
      bed may be in heaven, but, say what you will, you'll find me&mdash;honor
      bright&mdash;do you understand that, Miss Julia?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I think I do, Mogue, and if I didn't think so, I wouldn't have
      watched your return to-night as I did, or been here to speak to you on the
      subject you say you&mdash;know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' sure, Miss Julia, you might a known, for some time past that I knew
      it; didn't I look like one that was up to it? An' listen hether, Miss
      Julia, my family was all honor bright; we wor great people in our day;
      sure we owned a big sweep of country long ago an' wor great sogers. We
      fought against the Sassenaghs, the dirty English bodaghs, an' because
      there was a lot of us ever an' always hanged from time to time, that's the
      raison why we have sich a hatred to the English law still, one an' all of
      us. Sure my grandfather, glory be to God, was hanged for killin' a
      Sassenagh gauger, and my own father, Miss Julia, did his endeavors to be
      as great as the best of them, knowin' no other way for to vex and revinge
      himself upon the dirty Sassenaghs of the country; for sure, you know
      yourself, it's full o' them'&mdash;ay, about us in all directions. Be
      borried a horse in a private way from one o' them, but then he escaped
      from that; he next had a 'bout at what they call'd perjury, although it
      was well known to us all that it was only his thumb he kissed, and, any
      how, the thing was done upon a Protestant Bible; but, at all events, he
      went an' honest and honorably, as far as gettin' himself transported for
      parjury. I hope you understhand, Miss Julia, that I'm accountin' for any
      disparagin' observations you might a' heard against us, an' showin' you
      why we acted as we did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Mogue," said she, smiling at this most incomprehensible piece of
      family history, "I hope you don't intend to imitate the example or to
      share the fate of so many of your family!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You really hope so; now do you really hope so, Miss Julia?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unquestionably; for granting you marry, as, I dare say you intend, would
      it not be a melancholy prospect for your wife to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, then I do intend it; are you not satisfied, Miss Julia? and what is
      more, although it's my intention to violate the law in a private and
      confidential way, still I have no intention of bein' either hanged or
      transported by it; that I may be happy if I have&mdash;No, for the sake of
      that wife, Miss Julia, do you understand, it's my firm intention to die in
      my bed if I can; I hope you feel that there's comfort in that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To whatever woman you make happy Mogue, there will be. Well, but, Mogue,
      tell me; had you a good day's sport?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorra worse then; God pardon me for swearin'," he replied. "There riz a
      mist in the mountains that a man could build a house wid, if there was any
      implements to be found, hard and sharp enough to cut it. All we got was a
      brace of grouse and a snipe or two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And&mdash;hem&mdash;well but&mdash;hem&mdash;why Mogue, you give but a
      very miserable account of the proceedings of the day. Had you any one with
      you?&mdash;Oh, yes, by the way, did I not see Mr. M'Carthy go out with you
      this morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Miss Julia, you did; he went out wid me, sure enough," replied
      Mogue, drily, and with rather a dissatisfied tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is a&mdash;hem, does he shoot well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He shoots well enough, Miss Julia&mdash;when he pulls the trigger the gun
      goes off; but as for killin' birds, that my bed may be in heaven but they
      fly away laughin' at him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He came with you as far as O'Driscol's," she said, at once putting a
      query in the shape of an assertion, "and I suppose sent some apology to my
      father and brothers, for not having been here to dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hem! come as far as Mr. O'Driscol's?" exclaimed Mogue; "troth he's about
      the poorest piece o' goods ever carried a gun&mdash;God help the unhappy
      woman that'll get him; for sorra thing he is but a mere excuse for a man.
      I left him lyin' like a half-hung dog, up in the mountains above."
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia started, and almost screamed with terror at this account of her
      lover. "Gracious heavens, Moylan, what do you mean?" she exclaimed&mdash;"up
      in the mountains!&mdash;where and how in the mountains? Is he ill, or does
      he want aid or assistance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Miss Julia; but the truth is, he's a poor cur of a creature that's
      not able to undertake a man's task at all; he's lyin' knocked up in Frank
      Finnerty's; moanin' and groanin' an' yowlin', like a sick hound; I had to
      carry or drag him over half the mountains; for, from the blessed hour of
      twelve o'clock this day, he wasn't able to put a foot undher him, an' he
      did nothing but blasphayme' an' curse every one he knew; your fathers and
      brothers, your sisther, and mother, and yourself; he cursed and
      blasphaymed you all, helther skelther; I could bear all, Miss. Julia till
      he came to run you down, an' 'tis well for him that I hadn't the gun in my
      hand when he did it, that's all; or, that I may never do an ill turn but
      I'd a' given him a touch o' the Moylan blood for your sake&mdash;an' now,
      Miss Julia," he proceeded, "I hope we understand one another. As for him
      he's a pitiful whelp!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you in jest or earnest?" she inquired, changing her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That luck may flow on me, but I'm in airnest, Miss Julia&mdash;but no
      matther for that, don't you let you spirits down, think of our great
      family; and remimber that them that was wanst great may be great agin.
      Plaise God we'll have back the forwhitled estates, when we get the
      Millstone broke, an' the Mill that ground us banished from the counthry;
      however, that will come soon; but in the mane time, Miss Julia, I have a
      saycret to tell you about him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "About Mr. M'Carthy?" she asked, sadly puzzled as to the tendency and
      object of his conversation, but at the same time somewhat awakened to an
      indistinct interest, respecting this secret concerning her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, miss; listen hether, Miss Julia; would you believe it that he, Mr.
      M'Carthy, is sworn, or any way as good as sworn, to take your father's
      life away?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Mogue," she replied firmly, but with good humor, "not a syllable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well then," he proceeded, "if he did not swear to do it in plain words,
      he did as good. You won't braithe a syllable of this, Miss Julia; but
      listen still&mdash;You know the ruction that's through, the counthry
      aginst tides?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do, I am sorry to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' that the whole counthry is sworn Whiteboys, and that all the
      Whiteboys in sworn, of coorse, to put an end to them. That's the oath they
      take now, miss, by all accounts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So they say Mogue."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, miss, would you believe it, that that fellow, the ungrateful hound
      that he is, that same Francis M'Carthy, is at the head of them, is one of
      their great leaders, and is often out at night wid the villains, leadin'
      them on to disturbances, and directin' them how to act; ay, an' he doesn't
      like a bone in Mr. O'Driscol's body, any more than in your father's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!&mdash;ha!&mdash;ha! very good, Mogue, but make it short&mdash;ha!&mdash;ha!&mdash;ha!&mdash;and
      who's your authority for all this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Himself, miss, for a great part of it; it was this day, he wanted myself
      to become a White-boy; but I had the grace o' God about me, I hope, an'
      resisted the temptation. 'Mogue,' says he, 'you are a good Catholic, an'
      ought to join us; we're sworn to put down the tides altogether, an' to
      banish Protestantism out o' the counthry.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But is not M'Carthy himself a Protestant?" said Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not he, miss, he only turned to get a lob o' money from the Great College
      in Dublin above; sure they provide for any one that will turn, but he's a
      true Catholic at heart; air when the time comes he'll show it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you say he joins their meetings at night, Mogue?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I may be blest, but he does, miss; and since you must know the
      truth, he's at one o' them this very night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you have told me a falsehood with respect to his fatigue?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He put me up to it, miss; and bid me say it; howandever my mind wasn't
      aisy undher it; and now you know the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And does he blacken his face as well as the other Whiteboys?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That hurt or harm may never come near me but he does that same; I have it
      from them that seen him and knew him, in spite o' black face an' all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha! ha! ha!&mdash;well good-night, Mogue, and many thanks for your most
      important and truthful secret."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before you go, Miss Julia, one other word; listen, there a man worth a
      ship load of him, that's in grate consate wid you&mdash;remember the ould
      families, Miss Julia, an' them that suffered for&mdash;for&mdash;their
      counthry. Now here' the kind o' man I'd recommend you for a husband; don't
      let a pair o' red cheeks or black eyes lead you by the nose&mdash;an' what
      signifies a good figure, when neither the handsomest nor the strongest man
      can keep off a headache or a fit o' the blackguard cholic&mdash;bad luck
      to it&mdash;when they come on one. No, Miss Julia, always in the man
      that's to be your husband, prefer good lastin' color in the complection,
      an' little matther about the color of the eyes if they always smile upon
      yourself&mdash;then agin, never marry a man that swears, Miss Julia, but a
      man that's fond of his prayers, and is given to piety&mdash;sich men never
      use any but harmless oaths, sich as may I be blest, salvation to me, and
      the like&mdash;that's the kind o' men to make a husband of, and I have
      sich a man in my eye for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Mogue," said Julia, who was too quick-witted to misunderstand
      him any longer. "Many thanks for your good advice&mdash;and whisper, Mogue&mdash;who
      knows but I may follow it? Good-night!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-night, darlin'," he whispered in a kind of low triumphant cackle,
      that caused her to shake her very sides with laughter, after she had
      closed the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia Purcel, who could attribute Moylan's extraordinary conversation to
      nothing but a more than usual indulgence in liquor, did not for a single
      moment suffer herself to become influenced by the unaccountable
      information which she had heard respecting M'Carthy. But even if it had
      been true, she was so peculiarly circumstanced, that without disclosing
      the private conversation she had had with Moylan, she could not without
      pain communicate it to her family. As it was, however, she placed no
      confidence whatever in any portion of it, and on further reflection, she
      felt all her apprehensions concerning M'Carthy revived. If she experienced
      anything in the shape of satisfaction from the dialogue, it arose from the
      fact that if M'Carthy had suffered injury, Mogue would not have been so
      much at ease on his return. When his return was made known, however, to
      the family at large, Mogue repeated his first version, and assured them
      that he, M'Carthy had laid down in Finnerty's for an hour or so to recruit
      his strength. He supposed he would soon be home, he said&mdash;or for that
      matter, maybe as he found himself comfortable, he would stop there for the
      night. Mogue himself had come home to make their minds easy, and to let
      them know where he was, and what had kept him away. To a certain extent
      the family were satisfied, but as M'Carthy had communicated to the male
      portion of them the friendly warning he had got from the Whiteboy, they
      said, that although he might have been, safe enough when Mogue left him in
      the mountains, yet considering the state of the country, and that he
      unquestionably had enemies, he might not be free from danger on his way
      home. There was scarcely a night in the week that the country was not
      traversed by multitudes of those excited and unscrupulous mobs, that
      struck terror to the hearts of the peaceful, or such as were obnoxious to
      them. Accordingly, after waiting a couple of hours, Alick Purcel got a
      double case of pistols, and proposed to go as far as O'Driscol's, where
      they took it for granted, as he had not been able to come to dinner, they
      would find him should he have returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alick," said the father, "after all the notices we have got, and
      considering the feeling that is against us, it is ridiculous to be
      fool-hardy&mdash;don't go by the road but cross the fields."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such is my intention, sir," replied Alick; "for although no coward, still
      I am but flesh and blood, and it is death you know, for mere flesh and
      blood to stop a bullet. Give me my enemy face to face and I don't fear
      him, but when he takes me at night from behind a hedge, courage is of
      little use, and won't save my life."
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving at O'Driscol's, he found that M'Carthy had not come, and after
      waiting till one o'clock, he prepared to take his departure. At this
      moment, a female servant tapped at the drawing-room door, and after having
      been desired to come in, she communicated the following startling
      particulars:&mdash;She had forgotten her washing, she said, and gone out a
      little time before to bring it in, and in doing so, she spied several men
      with black faces and white shirts skulking about the house. She was not
      sure, she said, on having the question put to her, whether she had been
      seen by them or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      This communication, which was given with every mark of alarm and terror,
      completely altered the posture of affairs at the magistrate's. Katherine
      O'Driscol's face became deadly pale as she turned a glance upon young
      Purcel, which he well understood. "Alick," said she, "under these
      circumstances, it would, be absolute madness to attempt going home
      to-night. It is very likely they have discovered that you are here, and
      are watching for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if I do not return home," he replied, "it is equally probable that
      John and my father, wondering at my delay, may come to look for me, and in
      that case they might meet these ruffians&mdash;or rather might be waylaid
      by them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Purcel, my dear fellow!" said the magistrate, who was now pretty deep in
      his cups, and consequently somewhat pot-valiant&mdash;or at least disposed
      to show them a touch of his valor&mdash;"Alick, my dear fellow, you are
      courageous enough, I admit, but at the same time, you must put yourself
      under the guidance of a brave and loyal old magistrate, who is not to be
      cowed and intimidated by a crew of midnight cut-throats. You'll gee now,
      Alick, my boy, what a touch of loyal courage can do. Upon my honor, and
      conscience, I will myself escort you home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By no means, sir," replied Purcel, "I could not think of putting you to
      such a risk, and inconvenience at this late hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I say by all manes, Alick&mdash;and as for inconvanience, it is none
      at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Mr. Purcel will expose neither himself nor you, my dear father," said
      Katherine; "he will be guided by good sense, and remain here to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tut! you foolish cowardly girl, go to bed&mdash;you play loo very well,
      and have won seven-and-sixpence from me to-night. That's your province.
      No, upon my sowl and honor, I'll see him home. What! is it for the
      intelligent and determined O'Driscol, as your brother John said&mdash;and
      who is well known to be a very divil incarnate when danger's before him&mdash;is
      it for such a man&mdash;the terror of evil-doers&mdash;to funk from a crew
      of White-boys! What would my friend the Castle say if it knew it?&mdash;divil
      resave the line ever it would correspond with me again. Get me my pistols,
      I say&mdash;a case for each pocket, and the blunderbush under my arm&mdash;then
      come on, M'Donough, as the play says, and blazes to him who runs last."
      Here he gave a lurch a little to the one side, after which he placed
      himself in something intended for a military attitude, and drawing his
      hand down his whiskers, he inflated himself as if about to give the word
      of command, "Soldiers, steady,"&mdash;here he gave another lurch&mdash;"recover
      omes (arms)&mdash;charge bayonets&mdash;present&mdash;halt&mdash;to the
      right about&mdash;double quick&mdash;:bravo&mdash;you see what I could do,
      if placed in a military position."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We do, sir," said Fergus, laughing; "not a doubt of it." The latter then
      whispered something to Purcel, who smiled, and immediately turning to the
      doughty magistrate, said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sir, since you insist upon protecting me home&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good&mdash;that's the word, Alick&mdash;steady boys&mdash;shoulder omes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will feel very happy, sir, in your escort."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Alick&mdash;yes&mdash;exactly so&mdash;but then we are time enough,
      man&mdash;the night's but young yet&mdash;we must have another tumbler
      before we go&mdash;if it is only to put terror into these villains."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am exceedingly sorry that it is out of my power to wait, sir. My father
      and John may possibly come over here, and if they do it is difficult to
      say what these blood-thirsty villains, who care so little about human life&mdash;especially,
      sir, when that life belongs to either a tithe-proctor or a magistrate, may
      do. You will oblige me very much, sir, by coming with me now. I wish to
      heavens I had your courage, Mr. O'Driscol, and that I-was such a wicked
      and desperate dare-devil as you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good, Alick, upon my honor and conscience, you've hit me off there&mdash;hallo&mdash;what
      is this?&mdash;put these pistols and that blunder-bush aside, and be d&mdash;d
      to you, we don't want them yet awhile;" this was addressed to the servant
      who had brought them at Fergus's suggestion. "I am a hospitable man, Alick&mdash;a
      convivial man&mdash;and I tell you that I don't wish a guest to leave my
      house with dry lips&mdash;and what is more, I won't allow it&mdash;sit
      down then, and take your punch, or if you're afraid of these fellows why
      didn't you say so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am then, sir," replied Alick, who thought that by admitting the fact,
      he might the sooner bring matters between himself and the magistrate to a
      crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" exclaimed the latter, "you admit your cowardice, do you?&mdash;Well,
      upon my honor and reputaytion, Alick, I'm extremely surprised at you&mdash;a
      young fellow like you&mdash;and a coward! Now I'll tell you what, Alick, I
      hate a coward&mdash;I despise a coward, and d&mdash;n me if any man who is
      mane enough to acknowledge himself to be one, shall have the benefit of my
      escort this night. Then stay where you are, sir, and take your punch&mdash;but
      you are not entitled to any protection; no, confound me if you are! A nice
      office for a man of my mettle to escort a coward!&mdash;no, no&mdash;take
      your punch, I say&mdash;you are safe under this roof, but as touching my
      protection, no fellow of your kidney shall resave it from me, unless in
      honest open daylight with a body of police or military at my elbow; and,
      besides, you have declined my hospitality, Mr. Purcel, and with the man&mdash;but
      man you are not&mdash;who declines my hospitality, I will keep no terms.
      Here's the 'Castle!' long life to it, and may it never have occasion to
      read me a lecture for protecting a coward! Steady, men&mdash;shoulder
      oines!&mdash;ah, I'm a pearl before swine here:&mdash;upon my honor and
      conscience, I'm nothing else&mdash;hurra!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst this manifestation of courage and loyalty was proceeding, his
      daughter had sent a little girl by a lonely and circuitous way across the
      fields to Longshot Lodge, with a message to the effect that they had
      prevailed upon Alick to stop for the night, and that he would also
      breakfast there the next morning. The little girl's absence was very
      brief, and on her return, Alick had no hesitation in remaining. The heroic
      magistrate, having taken another tumbler, began to get drowsy, and with
      some assistance, was prevailed on to go to bed, where he almost
      immediately fell asleep. The two young men then got together all the arms
      and ammunition in the house, which, having made ready for an attack, they
      went also to bed, taking only their coats off, where for the present we
      leave them&mdash;but not asleep&mdash;and return to M'Carthy, for whose
      absence, no doubt, the reader is anxious that we should account.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.&mdash;Out of the Frying-Pan into the Fire.
    </h2>
    <p>
      M'Carthy on that night had not gone far, after having separated from the
      friendly Whiteboy, when he was met by a powerfully-formed man, who, he
      thought, bore a considerable resemblance in shape and size to the fellow
      who had been invested with authority not long before in Finnerty's. On
      seeing that it was M'Carthy, the stranger, whose face was blackened, and
      who also wore the white shirt outside, approached him coolly but
      determinedly, and laying his hand upon his shoulder, said&mdash;: "Your
      name is Francis M'Carthy'?" and as he spoke, M'Carthy could perceive the
      ends of a case of pistols projecting from his breast within the shirt,
      which was open at the neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I have never knowingly done anything that should occasion me to deny
      my name, I acknowledge it&mdash;you know me, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know you well. I meek it a point to know everyone who is worth knowing.
      In the meantime, M'Carthy, you'll come along with me, if you pleese."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not at all clear that I will," replied M'Carthy; "you are a perfect
      stranger to me&mdash;at least your disguise makes you so. You are out on
      illegal business, as is evident from that disguise, and you are armed with
      a case of pistols. Now, under these circumstances, happen what may, until
      I know more about you, and who you are, I will not walk one inch in your
      society, except as a free agent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear me," replied the other; "you were singled out for murdher this
      night, and you only escaped by a miracle&mdash;by the assistance of a man
      who is a warm friend to you, and who got information of the danger you wor
      in from another friend who suspected that you were in that danger. Two
      pistols wor loaded to settle you, as they say. Well, the person that saved
      your life damped the powder in these pistols&mdash;both wor snapped at
      you, and they didn't go off&mdash;am I right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right for so far, certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, the other two who followed you&mdash;one of them with a long,
      sharp dagger&mdash;were shot down&mdash;d&mdash;n your friend that didn't
      send the bullets through their brains instead of their hams and limbs;
      however, they fell and you escaped&mdash;am I right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly correct," replied M'Carthy; "and you must have had your
      information only from the person who befriended me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, have you-any objection to come with me now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every objection; I wish to go either to Mr. O'Driscol's or Mr. Purcel's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen. I say if you attempt this night to go to either one house or the
      other, you will never carry your life to them. If I was your enemy, and
      wished to put a bullet into you, what is there to prevent me now, I ask
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All, my good friend," replied M'Carthy, "that argument won't pass with
      me. Many. a man there is&mdash;and I dare say you know it well&mdash;who
      feels a strong scruple against committing murder with his own hands, who,
      notwithstanding, will not scruple to employ others to commit it for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you refuse to come with me, then? because if you do to-morrow mornin'
      will rise upon your corpse. Even I couldn't save you if you were known.
      There's a desperate and a dreadful game goin' to be played soon, and as
      you stand in the way of a man that possesses great power, and has a
      perticular end in view&mdash;the consequence is that you are doomed. Even
      if you do come with me, I must blacken your face, in ordher to prevint you
      from being known."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you answer me one question candidly," said M'Carthy&mdash;"if it's a
      fair one? Did I see you to-night before?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ask me no question," replied the man; "for I won't answer any I don't
      like, and that happens to be one o' them. Whether you saw me this night
      before, or whether you didn't, there is no occasion for me to say so, and
      I won't say it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I know him now," said M'Carthy; "and if I judge correctly, he is
      anything but a safe guide."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come," said the huge Whiteboy, "make up your mind; I won't weet another
      minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      M'Carthy paused and deliberately reconsidered as coolly as possible all
      the circumstances of the night. It was obvious that this man must have had
      his information with respect to the recent events from his friendly
      preserver&mdash;a man who would not be likely to betray him into danger
      after having actually saved his life, by running the risk of committing
      two murders. On the other band it was almost clear, from the manner in
      which the person before him pronounced certain words, as well as from his
      figure, that he was the celebrated and mysterious Buck English of whose
      means of living every one was ignorant, and who, as he himself had heard,
      expressed a strong dislike to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before I make up my mind," said M'Carthy, "may I ask another question?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fifty if you like, but I won't promise to answer any one o' them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was I brought to Finnerty's house with an evil purpose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No: the poor, pious fool that brought you&mdash;there&mdash;but I'm wrong
      in sayin' so&mdash;for it was the mist that done it. No, the poor fool
      that came there with you is a crature that nobody would trust. He thinks
      you're lyin' sound asleep in Finnerty's this minute. He's fit for nothing
      but prayin' and thinking the girls in love with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," replied M'Carthy, "at all events you are a brother Irishman, and I
      will put confidence in you; come, I am ready to accompany you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, then, you must suffer me to blacken your face, and for fear
      your shoot-in' jacket might betray you, I'll put this shirt over it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He then pulled out an old piece of crumpled paper that contained a mixture
      of lampblack and grease, with which he besmeared his whole face, from his
      neck to the roots of his hair, after which he stripped the shirt he wore
      outside his clothes, and in about two or three minutes completely
      metamorphosed our friend M'Carthy into a thorough-looking Whiteboy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come along now," said he, "and folly me; but even as it is, and in spite
      of your disguise, we must take the lonesomest way to the only place I
      think you'll be safe in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am altogether in your hands," replied M'Carthy, "and shall act as you
      wish."
    </p>
    <p>
      They then proceeded across the country for about two miles, keeping up
      towards the mountainous district, after which they made a turn and entered
      a deep valley, in whose lowest extremity stood a long, low house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," said the stranger, "before we go in here, remember what I'm goin'
      to say to' you. If any one&mdash;I mean a Whiteboy,"&mdash;here M'Carthy
      started, struck by the peculiarity of the pronunciation&mdash;a
      circumstance which by no means strengthened his sense, of security&mdash;"if
      any of them should come across you and ask you for the pass, here it is.
      <i>What's the hour?</i> Answer&mdash;<i>Very near the right one. Isn't it
      come yet?</i> Answer&mdash;<i>The hour is come, but not the man. When will
      he come?</i> Answer&mdash;<i>He is within sight</i>." He repeated these
      words three or four times, after which he and M'Carthy entered the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God save all here!" said the guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God save you kindly, boys."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Cassidy," he continued, "here's poor fellow on his keepin' for tithe
      business and although you don't know me, I know you well enough to be
      sartin that you'll give this daicent boy a toss in a bed till daybreak&mdash;an'
      a mouthful to ate if he should want it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Troth an' I will, sir; isn't one o' my poor boys in Lisnagola goal for
      the same tithes&mdash;bad luck to them&mdash;that is for batin' one of the
      vagabonds that came to collect them. Troth he'll have the best bed in my
      house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And listen, Mrs. Cassidy; if any of us should happen to come here
      to-night&mdash;although I don't think it's likely they will, still it's
      hard to say, for the country's alive with with them&mdash;if any of them
      should come here, don't let them know that this poor boy is in the house&mdash;do
      you mind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, then, it would be a bad day or night either I wouldn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you have anything to ate or dhrink," asked the guide of M'Carthy..
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing," replied the other; "I only wish to get to bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, then," said the colossal Whiteboy, "I'll show you where you're to
      lie."
    </p>
    <p>
      They accordingly left the kitchen, passed through a tolerably large room,
      with two or three tables and several chairs in it, and entered another,
      which was also of a good size. Here there was a bed, and in this M'Carthy
      was to rest&mdash;if rest he could under a series of circumstances so
      extraordinary and exciting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," said his guide, for such we must call him&mdash;"observe this," and
      he brought him to a low window which opened at the back of the house,
      "press that spot where you see the frame is sunk a little&mdash;you can
      feel it, too, aisily enough in the dark&mdash;very well, press that with
      your thumb and the windy will open by being pushed outwards. If you feel
      or find that there's any danger you can slip out of it; however, don't be
      alarmed bekase you may hear voices. There's only one set that you may be
      afraid of&mdash;they're on the look-out for yourself&mdash;but I don't
      think it's likely they'll come here. If they do, however, and that you
      hear them talkin' about you, there's your way to get off. Come, now, I
      must try you again before I go. What's the hour?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very near the right one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't it come yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The hour is come but not the man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When will he come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is within sight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, good-bye, you may take a good sleep but don't strip; lie just as you
      are&mdash;that's twiste your life has been saved this night. In the mane
      time, you must give me back that overall shirt&mdash;your danger I hope is
      past, but I may want it to-night yet; and stay, I was near spoilin' all&mdash;I
      forgot to give you the right grip&mdash;here it is&mdash;if any of them
      shakes hands wid you, mark this&mdash;he presses the point of his thumb on
      the first joint of your fore-finger, and you press yours upon the middle
      joint of his little finger, this way&mdash;you won't forget that now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not," replied M'Carthy, "I will remember it accurately."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," he proceeded, "take my advice, get to Dublin without delay&mdash;if
      you remain here you're a dead man; you may never see me again, so God
      bless you." and with these words he left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is difficult to describe M'Carthy's state of mind on finding himself
      alone. The events of the night, fearful as they were, joined to his
      singular and to him unaccountable escape&mdash;his present state of
      uncertainty and the contingent danger that awaited him&mdash;the fact that
      parties were in search of him for the purpose of taking away his life,
      whilst he himself remained utterly unconscious of the cause which
      occasioned such, a bitter and unrelenting enmity against him&mdash;all
      these reflections, coming together upon a mind already distracted and
      stupefied by want of rest, and excessive weariness&mdash;succeeded in
      inducing first a wild sense of confusion&mdash;then forgetfulness of his
      position, and ultimately sound and dreamless sleep. How long that sleep
      had continued he could not even guess, but be that as it may, on awaking,
      he heard, medley of several voices in the next room, all engaged in an
      earnest conversation, as was evident, not merely from the disjointed
      manner of their pronunciation but a strong smell of liquor which assailed
      his nose. His first impulse was to arise and escape by the window, but on
      reflection, as he saw by the light of their candle that the door between
      the two apartments was open, he deemed it safer to keep quiet for a
      little, with a hope that they might soon take their departure. He felt
      anxious, besides, to ascertain whether the party in question consisted of
      those whom the strange guide had mentioned as being his enemies. In the
      meantime, the following agreeable dialogue greeted his ears and banished
      for the moment every other thought and consideration.

      "It was altogether a bad business this night. He was as well set as man
      could be, but hell pursue the pistols, they both missed fire; and thim
      that did go off hit the wrong men. The same two&mdash;we can't names boys,
      won't be the betther of it for some time. We met them, you see, in the
      mountains, where we wor goin' on a little business. Here's that we may
      never ait worse mait than mutton!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "More power, Dick&mdash;Dick, (hiccup) you're a trojan, an' so was your
      father and mother afore you; here's your to&mdash;toast, Dick, that we may
      ever an' always ait no worse mait than&mdash;praties an' point, hurra!&mdash;that's
      the chat, ha!&mdash;ha!&mdash;ha!&mdash;ah, begad it's we that's the
      well-fed boys&mdash;ay, but sure our friends the poor parsons has been
      always starvin' in the counthry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Always starvin' the counthry!" exclaimed another, playing upon the word,
      "be my sowl you're right there, Ned. Well sure they're gettin' a touch of
      it now themselves; by japers, some o' them knows what it is to have the
      back and belly brought together, or to go hungry to bed, as the sayin' is;
      but go on, Dick, an' tell us how it was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you see, we went back when we heard that the house was to be
      attacked, and only he escaped the way he did, it wouldn't be attacked;
      howaniver, you know it's wid O'Driscol&mdash;a short cooser to him, too,
      and he'll get it&mdash;it's wid O'Driscol he stops. So off we went, and
      waited in Barney Broghan's still-house, where we had a trifle to dhrink."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Divil resave the bet&mdash;bettherer spirits ever came from&mdash;a still&mdash;il
      eye, nor dar-lent Bar&mdash;ar&mdash;ney Brogh&mdash;aghan makes&mdash;whisht!&mdash;more
      power!&mdash;won't the counthry soon&mdash;be our&mdash;our&mdash;own&mdash;whips!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ned, hould your tongue, an' let him go 'an; well, Dick."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afther waitin' in the still-house till what we thought was the proper
      time, we went to O'Driscol's, and first struv to get in quietly, but you
      see we had no friends in the camp, for the men-servants all sleep in the
      outhouses, barrin' the butler; an' he's not the thing for Ireland. Well
      and good, although among ourselves, it was anything but well and good this
      night; however, we demanded admittance, an' jist as if they had been on
      the watch for us&mdash;a windy was raised, and a voice called out to us to
      know what we wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Neither to hurt or harm any one in the house,' we said, 'or belongin' to
      it; but there is a stranger in it that we must have out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Ay,' said another voice, that several of us knew to be Mr. Alick
      Purcel's; 'here I am&mdash;you scoundrels, but that's your share of me. If
      you don't begone instantly,' says he, swearin' an oath, 'we'll shoot you
      like dogs where you stand.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'We know you, Mr. Purcel,' says we, 'but it isn't you we want to-night&mdash;your
      turn's to come yet; time about is fair play. It's M'Carthy we want.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You must want him, then,' says young O'Driscol, 'for he's not here; and
      even if he was, you should fight for him before you'd get him&mdash;but
      what might your business be wid him?' he asked. 'Why,' says we, 'there's a
      man among us that has an account to settle wid him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Ah, you cowardly scoundrels,' says he, 'that's a disgrace to the
      counthry, and to the very name of Irishman; it's no wondher for strangers
      to talk of you as they do&mdash;no wondher for your friends to have a
      shamed face for your disgraceful crimes. You would now take an inoffensive
      gintleman&mdash;one that never harmed a man of you, nor any one else&mdash;you'd
      take him out, bekaise some blackhearted cowardly villain among you has a
      pick (pique) against him, and some of you for half-a-crown or a bellyful
      of whisky would murdher him in could blood. Begone, or by the livin'
      Farmer, I'll scatter the contents of this blunderbush among you.' He that
      wishes to have M'Carthy done for was wid us himself, and tould us in Irish
      to fire at the windy, which we did, and on the instant slop came a shower
      of bullets among us. A boy from the Esker got one of them through the
      brain, and fell stone dead; two others&mdash;we can't mention names&mdash;was
      wounded, and it was well we got them off safe. So there's our night's work
      for us. Howaniver, the day's comin' when we'll pay them for all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think, boys," said a person, whose voice was evidently that of a man
      advanced in years, "I think you ought to give this procthor Purcel a
      cardin'. He lifts the tithes of four parishes, and so far he's a scourge
      over four parishes; himself and his blasted citations to the bishop's
      court and his blasted decrees&mdash;hell purshue him, as it will. Ah, the
      Carders wor fine fellows, so were the Sextons."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bravo, Billy Bradly, conshumin' to me but I'm&mdash;I'm main proud, and
      that we met you com&mdash;omin' from the wake to-night; I am, upon my sow&mdash;owl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe, Billy," said another voice, "you had your own fun wid
      procthors in your day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before the union&mdash;hell bellows it for a union&mdash;-but it has been
      a black sight to the counthry! Amin this night&mdash;before the union,
      it's we that did handle the procthors in style; it isn't a cowardly
      threatenin' notice we'd send them, and end there. No&mdash;but I'll tell
      you what we done one night, in them days. There was a man, a procthor, an'
      he was a Catholic too, for I needn't tell you, boys, that there never was
      a Protestant procthor half as hard and cruel as one of our own ralligion,
      an' thas well known. Well, there was this procthor I'm tellin' of, his
      name was Callaghan; he was a dark-haired I'll-lookin' fellow, with a
      squint and a stutther; but for all that, he had a daicent, quiet,
      well-behaved family that offended nobody&mdash;not like our proud
      horsewhippin' neighbors; an', indeed, his daughters did not mount their
      side-saddles like some of the same neighbors, but sure we all know the
      ould proverb, set a beggar on horseback, and we needn't tell you where
      he'll ride to. Well, I'm forgettin' my story in the mane time. At that
      time, a party of about sixty of us made up our minds to pay Callaghan a
      nightly visit. The man, you see, made no distinction betune the rich and
      poor, or rather he made every distinction, for he was all bows and scrapes
      to the rich, and all whip and fagot to the poor. Ah, he was a sore
      blisther to that part of the counthry he lived in, and many a widow's an'
      orphan's curse he had. At any rate, to make a long story short, we went a
      set of us, a few nights afore we called upon him&mdash;that is, in a
      friendly way, for we had no intention of takin' his life, but merely to
      tickle him into good humor a bit, and to make him have a little feelin'
      for the poor, that he many a time tickled an' got tickled by the sogar's
      bagnet to some purpose; we went, I say, to a lonely place, and we dug sich
      a grave as we thought might fit him, and havin' buttoned and lined it well
      with thorns, we then left it covered over with scraws for fraid anybody
      might find it out. So far so good. At last the appointed night came, and
      we called upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Is Mr. Callaghan in?' said one of us, knockin' at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What's your business wid him?' said a servant girl, as she opened the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis to pay some tithe I want,' says the man; and no sooner was the word
      out of his mouth than in we boulted betther than a score of us; for the
      rest all stayed about the place to act accordin' to circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'How do you do, Misther Callaghan?' says our captain, 'I hope you're
      well, sir,' says he, 'and in good health.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I can't say I am, sir," said Callaghan, 'I haven't been to say at all
      well for the last few days, wid a pain down my back.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Ah, indeed no wondher, Mr. Callaghan,' says the other; 'that's the curse
      of the widows and orphans, and the poor in general, that you have
      oppressed in ordher to keep up a fat an' greedy establishment,' says he,
      'but in the mane time, keep a good heart&mdash;we're friends of yours, and
      wishes you well; and if the curses have come down hot and heavy on your
      back, we'll take them off it,' says he, 'so aisily and purtily, that if
      you'll only shut your eyes, you'll think yourself in another world&mdash;I
      mane of coorse the world you'll go to,' says he;&mdash;'we have got a few
      nice and aisy machines here, for ticklin' sich procthors, in ordher to
      laugh them into health again, and we'll now set you to rights' at wanst.
      Comes, boys,' says he, turnin' to us, 'tie every sowl in the house,
      barrin' the poor sick procthor that we all feel for, bekaise you see,
      Misther Callaghan, in ordher to do the thing complate, we intind to have
      your own family spectawthers of the cure.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No,' said one of them, a determined man he was, 'that wasn't in our
      agreement, nor it isn't in our hearts, to trate the innocent like the
      guilty.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It must be done,' said the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No,' said the other back to him, 'the first man that mislists a hair of
      one of his family's heads, I'll put the contents of this through him&mdash;if
      this onmanly act had been mentioned before, you'd a' had few here tonight
      along wid you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sure enough, the most of us was wid the last speaker, so, instead
      of cardin' the sick procthor before his own family, we tied and gagged him
      so as that he neither spoke nor budged, and afther clappin' a guard upon
      the family for an hour or two, we put him on horseback and brought him up
      to where the grave was made. We then stripped him, and layin' him across a
      ditch, we got the implements, of the feadhers as we call them, to tickle
      him. Well, now, could you guess, boys, what these feadhers was? I'll go
      bail you couldn't, so I may as well tell you at wanst; divil resave the
      thing else, but half-a-dozen of the biggest tom-cats we could get, and
      this is the way we used them. Two or three of us pitched our hands well
      and the tails of the cats into the bargain, we then, as I said, laid the
      naked procthor across a ditch, and began to draw the tom-cats down the
      flesh of his back. God! how the unfortunate divil quivered and writhed and
      turned&mdash;until the poor wake crature, that at first had hardly the
      strength of a child, got, by the torture he suffered, the strength of
      three men; for indeed, afther he broke the cords that tied him, three, nor
      three more the back o' that, wasn't sufficient to hould him. He got the
      gag out of his mouth, too, and then, I declare to my Saviour his scrames
      was so awful that we got frightened, for we couldn't but think that the
      voice was unnatural, an sich as no man ever heard. We set to, however, and
      gagged and tied him agin, and then we carded him&mdash;first down, then
      up, then across by one side, and after that across by the other. * Well,
      when this was done, we tuk him as aisily an' as purtily as we could.
    </p>
    <p>
      "D&mdash;n your soul, you ould ras&mdash;rascal," said the person they
      called Ned, "you wor&mdash;wor 'all a parcel o' bloody, d&mdash;n, hell&mdash;fi&mdash;fire
      cowardly villains, to&mdash;to&mdash;thrat&mdash;ate any fellow crature&mdash;crature
      in sich a way. Why didn't you shoo&mdash;shoo&mdash;oot him at wanst, an'
      not put&mdash;ut him through hell's tor&mdash;tortures like that, you
      bloody-minded ould dog!"
    </p>
    <p>
      To tell the truth, many of them were shocked at the old carder's
      narrative, but he only, grinned at them, and replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, shoot&mdash;you may talk about shootin,' Ned, avick, but for all that
      life's sweet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get on&mdash;out, you ould sinner o' perdition&mdash;to blazes wid you;
      life's sweet you ould 'shandina&mdash;what a purty&mdash;urty way you tuk
      of sweetenin' it for him. I tell&mdash;ell you, Bil&mdash;lilly Bradly,
      that you'll never die on your bed for that night's wo&mdash;ork."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And even if I don't, Ned, you won't have my account to answer for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' mighty glad I am of it: my own&mdash;own's bad enough, God knows, an'
      for the mat&mdash;matther o' that&mdash;here's God pardon us all, barrin'
      that ould cardin' sinner&mdash;amin, acheerna villish, this night! Boys,
      I'll sing-yes a song."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aisy, Ned," said one or two of them, "bad as it was, let us hear Billy
      Bradly's story out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," proceeded Billy, "when the ticklin' was over, we took the scraws
      off of the grave, lined wid thorns as it was, and laid the procthor, naked
      and bleedin'&mdash;scarified into gris-kins&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me at&mdash;at him, the ould cardin' mur&mdash;urdherer; plain
      murdher's daicency compared to that. Don't hould me, Dick; if I was sworn
      ten times over, I'll bate the divil's taptoo on his ould carkage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be aisy, Ned&mdash;be aisy now, don't disturb the company&mdash;sure you
      wouldn't rise your hand to an ould man like Billy Bradly. Be quiet."
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;"Scarified into griskins as he was," proceeded Bradly looking at
      Ned with a grin of contempt&mdash;"ay, indeed, snug and cosily we laid him
      in his bed of feadhers, and covered him wid thin scraws for fear he'd
      catch could&mdash;he! he! he! That's the way we treated the procthors in
      our day. I think I desarve a drink now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Drinking was now resumed with more vigor, and the proceedings of the night
      were once more discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was a badly-managed business every way," said one of them, "especially
      to let M'Carthy escape; however, we'll see him 'igain, and if we can jist
      lay our eyes upon him in some quiet place, it'll be enough;&mdash;what's
      to be done wid this body till mornin.' It can't be lyin' upon the chairs
      here all might."
    </p>
    <p>
      M'Carthy, we need scarcely assure our readers, did not suffer all this
      time to pass without making an effort to escape. This, however, was a
      matter of dreadful danger, as the circumstances of the case stood. In the
      first place, as we have already said, the door between the room in which
      he lay and that in which the Whiteboys sat, was open, and the light of the
      candles shone so strongly into it, that it was next to an impossibility
      for him to cross over to the window without being seen; in the second
      place, the joints of the beds were so loose and rickety that, on the
      slightest motion of its Occupant, it creaked and shrieked so loud, that
      any attempt to rise off it must necessarily have discovered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must do something with the body of this unlucky boy," continued the
      speaker; "divil resave you, M'Carthy, it was on your account he came to
      this fate; blessed man, if we could only catch him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, Dick, you and Jemmy there, and Art, come and let us bring him into
      the bed' in the next room&mdash;it's a fitter and more properer place for
      him than lyin' upon chairs here. God be merciful to you, poor Lanty, it's
      little you expected this when you came out to-night! Take up the candles
      two more of you, and go before us: here&mdash;steady now; mother of
      heaven, how stiff and heavy he has got in so short a time&mdash;and his
      family! what will they say? Hell resave you, M'Carthy, I say agin! I'm but
      a poor man, and I wouldn't begrudge a five-pound note to get widin shot of
      you, wherever you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be idle to attempt anything like a description of M'Carthy's
      feelings, upon such an occasion as this. It is sufficient to say, that he
      almost gave himself up for lost, and began to believe, for the first time
      in his life, that there is such a thing as fate. Here had his life been
      already saved once to-night, but scarcely had he escaped when he is met by
      a person evidently disguised, but by whose language he is all but made
      certain that he is a man full of mystery, and who besides has expressed
      strong enmity against him. This person, with a case of pistols in his
      breast, compels him, as it were, to put himself under his protection; and
      he conducts him into a remote isolated shebeen-house, where, no doubt,
      there is a meeting of Whiteboys every night in the week. The M'Carthy
      spirit is, proverbially, brave and intrepid, but we are bound to say, that
      notwithstanding its hereditary intrepidity, our young friend would have
      given the wealth of Europe to have found himself at that moment one single
      mile away from the bed on which he lay. His best policy was now to affect
      sleep, and he did so with an apparent reality borrowed from desperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo!" exclaimed those who bore the candle, on looking at the bed, "who
      the devil and Jack Robinson have we got here? Aisy, boys&mdash;here's some
      blessed clip or other fast asleep: lay down poor Lanty on the ground till
      we see who this. Call Molly Cassidy; here, Molly, who the dickens is this
      chap asleep?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly immediately made her appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Troth I dunna who he is," she replied; "he's some poor boy on his
      keepin', about tithes, tha' <i>He</i> brought here to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a cursed lie, Molly; wid' many respects to you, <i>He</i> couldn't
      a' been here to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir, whoever you are; but I tell you it's no lie; and he was
      here, and left that boy wid me, desirin' me to let him come to no injury,
      for that&mdash;" and this was an addition of her own, "there was hundreds
      offered for the takin' of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what did he do, did you hear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He whispered to me," she replied, in a low voice, but loud enough for
      M'Carthy to hear, "that he shot a tithe-proctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll see what he's made of, though," said one of them; "and, at all
      events, we'd act very shabbily if we didn't give him a share af what's
      goin'; but aisy, boys," he added, "take care&mdash;ay! aisy, I say, safe's
      the word; who knows but he's a spy in disguise, and, in that case, we'll
      have a different card to play. Hallo! neighbor," he exclaimed, giving
      M'Carthy a shove, who started up and looked about him with admirable tact.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What&mdash;what&mdash;eh&mdash;what's this? who are you all? what are you
      about?" he asked, and as he spoke, he sprung to his feet. "What's this?"
      he exclaimed again. "Sweet Jasus! is this Fagan the tithe-proctor that I
      shot? eh&mdash;or are you&mdash;stay&mdash;no&mdash;ah, no&mdash;not the
      polis. Oh, Lord, but I'm relieved; I thought you were polis, but I see by
      your faces that I'm safe, at last&mdash;I hope so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, to be sure, you're safe&mdash;safe&mdash;as&mdash;as the bank
      (hiccup). You're a gintlemen, si&mdash;r you're a Con Roe&mdash;the ace o'
      hearts you are. Ay, you shot&mdash;like a ma&mdash;an, and didn't card&mdash;ard
      him wid tomcats, and then put the poo&mdash;oo&mdash;oor (hiccup) devil
      into a grave lined wid thorns; ah, you cowardly ould villain! the devil,
      in the shape of a to&mdash;to&mdash;tom-cat will card you in hell yet; an'
      moreover, you'll ne&mdash;never&mdash;ever die in your bed, you
      hard-hearted ould scut o' blazes; an' that you may not, I pray Ja&mdash;sa&mdash;sus
      this night&mdash;an' God forgive us all&mdash;amin, acheema!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hould your drunken tongue, Ned," said he who seemed to assume authority
      over them; "we want to put this poor boy, who died of liquor to-night,
      into the bed, and I suppose you'll have no objection."
    </p>
    <p>
      "None at all at all," replied M'Carthy, assuming the brogue, at which,
      fortunately for himself, he was an adept; "it's a good man's case, boys;
      blood an' turf, give him a warm birth of it&mdash;he'll find it snug and
      comfortable."
    </p>
    <p>
      They then placed the corpse on the bed but changing their mind, they
      raised him for a moment, putting him under the bedclothes, pinned a
      stocking, about his head to give him a domestic look; after which they
      returned to the tap-room of the shebeen-house, for such in fact it was.
      The latter change in the position of the corpse was made from an
      apprehension lest the police might come in search of the body, and with
      the hope that he might pass for a person asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll drink something wid us," said the principal among them; "but,
      before you do, I suppose you are as you ought to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      M'Carthy, who really was in a frightful state of thirst, determined at
      once to put on the reckless manner of a wild and impetuous Irishman, who
      set all law and established institutions at defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You suppose I am as I ought to be," he exclaimed, with a look of
      contempt; "why, thin, I suppose so too: in the mane time, an' before you
      bother me wid more gosther, I'd thank you to give me a drink o' whisky and
      wather&mdash;for, to tell you the truth, blast me but I think there's a
      confligration on a small scale goin' an inwardly; hurry, boys, or I'll
      split. Ah, boys, if you but knew what I wint through the last three days
      an' three nights."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what did you go through it all for?" asked the principal of them,
      with something of distrust in his manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did I go through it fwhor? fwhy, thin, fwhor the sake o' the trewth&mdash;I'm
      a Gaaulway man, boys, and it isn't in Can-naught you'll fwhind the man
      that's afeard to do fwhat's right: here's aaul your healths, and that
      everything may soon be as it ought to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said the other, "you are a Can-naught man sartainly, that's clear
      from your tongue; but I want to axe you a question.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fwhy nat? it's but fair,&mdash;it's but fair, I say,&mdash;take that wit
      j'ou, an' I'm the boy that will answer it, if I can, bekaise you know, or
      maybe you don't&mdash;but it's a proverb we have in Cannaught wit us&mdash;that
      a fool may ax a question that a wise man couldn't answer: well, what is
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who brought you here to-night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who brought me here to-night? fwhy, thin, I'll tell you as much of it as
      I like&mdash;<i>He</i> did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be japers it's a lie, beggin' your pardon, my worthy Cannaught man. <i>He</i>
      couldn't be here to-night. I know where he was the greater part of the
      night, and the thing's impossible. I don't know you, but we must know you&mdash;ay,
      and we will know you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trath an' I must know you, thin, and that very soon," replied M'Carthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come into the next room, then," said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anywhere you like," he replied, "I'm wit you; but I'm not the boy to be
      humbugged, or to bear your thricks upon thravellers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," said the other, when they had got into the room where the corpse
      lay, "shake hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      They accordingly shook hands, and M'Carthy gave him the genuine grip, as
      he had been taught it by the Whiteboy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right," said the man, "for so far; now, what's the hour?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very near the right one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't it come yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The hour is come, but not the man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When will he come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is within sight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's all right; come in and take another dhrink," said the man; "but
      still, who brought you here? for I know <i>He</i> couldn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      M'Carthy replied, winking towards the kitchen, "Troth she'll tell you that
      story; give me another drink o' fwhiskey and water. Oh, I'm hardly able to
      sit up, I'm getthi' so drowsy. A wink o' sleep, I may say, didn't crass my
      eye these three nights; an' I'd wish to stretch myself beside the poor boy
      widin. I'm an my keepin', boys, and fwhin you know that the law was at my
      heels fwhor the last foive weeks, you'll allow I want rest: throth I must
      throw myself somewhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go in, then, poor fellow, and lie down," said the same individual, who
      acted as spokesman; "we know how you must feel, wid the hell-hounds of the
      law affcher you: here, Jack, hould the candle for him, and help him to
      move over poor Lanty to make room for him; and Mrs. Cassidy," he called m
      a louder voice, "bring us another bottle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith, to tell you the truth," replied Jack, "I'd rather not; I don't
      like to go near a dead body."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here," said the person called Dick, "give me the candle: poor fellow! it
      is rest you want, and God forbid we wouldn't do everything in our power
      for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      They then entered the apartment, and M'Carthy was about to lay himself
      beside the corpse, when his companion tapped him significantly on the
      shoulder, and, his finger on his lips pointed to the window and
      immediately whispered in his ear: "I will leave the windy so that it will
      open at wanst: three of us knows you, Mr. M'Carthy I will sing a song when
      I go in again, which they will chorus; fly then, for it's hard to say what
      might happen: the day is now breakin' and you might be known&mdash;in that
      case I needn't tell you what your fate would be."
    </p>
    <p>
      He then returned to his companion having carefully closed the door after
      him so as to prevent, as much as possible the motions of M'Carthy from
      being seen or heard. On rejoining them he observed "well, if ever a poor
      boy was fairly broken down, and he is&mdash;throth he was no sooner, on
      the bed than he was off; an' among ourselves, the sleep must be heavy on
      him when he could close his eyes an' a dead man in the bed wid him."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.&mdash;Strange Faces&mdash;Dare-Devil O'Driscol Aroused
    </h2>
    <p>
      We have already stated that the proctors daughters had relieved their
      mother from the duty which, that kind-hearted woman had been in the habit
      of imposing on herself we mean that of attending and relieving the sick
      and indigent in her immediate neighborhood. On the morning in question
      Juli Purcel, who, together with her sister, for some time past been
      attending the bed of an interesting young female, to one of her father's
      workmen, had got up at an early hour to visit her&mdash;scarcely with a
      hope, it is true, that she would find the poor invalid alive. Much to her
      satisfaction, however, she found her better, and with some dawning
      prospects of ultimate recovery. She left with her mother the means of
      procuring such comforts as she considered might be suitable to her in the
      alternative of her convalescence, and had got more than home when she felt
      startled for a by the appearance of a person who seemed to have been
      engaged in some of these nightly outrages that were then so numerous in
      the country. The person in question had just leaped from an open breach in
      the hedge which bounded the right-hand side of the road exactly opposite
      where she was passing. The stranger's appearance was certainly calculated
      to excite terror, especially in a female; for although he did not wear the
      shirt over his clothes, his face was so deeply blackened that a single
      shade of his complexion could not be recognized. We need not again assure
      our readers that Julia Purcel possessed the characteristic firmness and
      courage of her family, but notwithstanding this she felt somewhat alarmed
      at the appearance of a lawless Whiteboy, who was at that moment most
      probably on his return from the perpetration of some midnight atrocity.
      This alarm was increased on seeing that the person in question approached
      her, as if with some deliberate intent.

    </div>
    <p>
      "Stand back, sir," she exclaimed. "What can you mean by approaching me?
      Keep your distance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, good God! my dear Julia, what means this? Do you not know me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Know you! No, sir," she replied, "how could I know such a person?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had unconsciously paused a moment when the Whiteboy, as she believed
      him to be, first made his appearance, but now she pursued her way home,
      the latter, however, accompanying her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, my dear Julia, I am thunderstruck! What can I have done thus to
      incur your displeasure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are rude and impertinent, sir, to address me with such unjustifiable
      familiarity. It is evident you know me, but I am yet to learn how I could
      have formed an acquaintance with a person whose blackened face indicates
      the nature of his last night's occupation."
    </p>
    <p>
      The person she addressed suddenly put up his hand, and then looking at his
      fingers, immediately disclosed a set of exceedingly white and well-formed
      teeth, which disclosure was made by a grin that almost immediately
      quavered off into a loud and hearty laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" he exclaimed, on recovering his gravity, "it is no wonder, my dear
      Julia, that you should not know me. Since I went out to shoot with Mogue
      Moylan, yesterday morning, I have gone through many strange adventures."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" she exclaimed, with evident symptoms of alarm and vexation, "Frank
      M'Carthy!" and, as she spoke, the remarkable conversation which she had
      had with Mogue Moylan, and the information he had given her with respect
      to M'Carthy's connection with the Whiteboys, instantly flashed upon her,
      accompanied now by a strong conviction of its truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Explain yourself, Mr. M'Carthy," she exclaimed, in a tone of voice which
      indicated anything but satisfaction. "How am I to account for this
      unbecoming disguise, so much at variance with your habits of life and
      education?&mdash;perhaps I should not say your habits of life&mdash;but
      certainly with your education. Have you, too, been tempted to join this
      ferocious conspiracy which is even now convulsing the country?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No wonder you should ask, my dear Julia," he replied; "but really the
      incidents, which have caused me to appear as you see me, are so strange,
      and yet so much in keeping with the spirit of the times, that I must
      defer, until a more convenient opportunity a full account of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do so, sir," she replied quickly; "allow yourself full time to give the
      best possible explanation of your conduct. I probably have put the
      question too abruptly; but, in the meantime, you will have the goodness,
      either to go on before me, or to fall back, as I presume, you will grant
      that it is neither delicate nor becoming for me, who wear no disguise and
      am known, to be seen at such an hour holding conversation with a
      Whiteboy."
    </p>
    <p>
      The impropriety of the thing struck him at once, and he replied, "You are
      right, Julia; but I perceive that something has given you offence; if it
      be my appearance, I tell you that I can afford you a satisfactory
      explanation. Proceed now&mdash;I shall remain here for a time;&mdash;whether
      with black face or white, I should not wish it to be supposed that we held
      a clandestine meeting at this hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      She then bowed to him with more formality than she had probably ever used,
      and proceeded home at a quicker pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had just turned an angle of the road, and got consequently out of
      sight, when he heard a strong, but sweet and mellow voice singing the fine
      old Irish song of the Cannie Soogah, or Jolly Pedlar; and, on looking
      behind him, he perceived that worthy person approaching him at a tolerably
      rapid pace. The pedlar had no sooner glanced at M'Carthy than he grasped
      his tremendous cudgel with greater firmness, and putting his hand into his
      breast, he pulled out a pistol, and with these preparations approached our
      friend, still continuing his song, with the same careless glee, and an
      utter absence of all fear.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "'I' m the rantin' cannie soogah'&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      "God save you, neighbor! you forgot to wash your face this mornin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's its natural color," replied M'Carthy, willing, now that he was out
      of all danger, to have a banter with his well-known friend the pedlar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you take my advice then," said the pedlar, "you'll paint it white&mdash;it's
      a safer color in daylight at any rate. I'm thinkin' now, that if you met a
      party of peelers on pathrole, they might give you a resate for turnin' the
      same color red and white; however, <i>glunthoma</i>, (* Hear me) if you
      have any design upon the Cannie Soogah, I can only tell you that I never
      carry money about me, and even if I did, I have a couple o' friends here
      that 'ud standby me; ay, in throth, three o' them, for I have brother to
      this fellow (showing the pistol) asleep in my breast here, and he doesn't
      like to be wakened, you persave; so whoever you are, jog on and wash your
      face, as I said, and that's a friend's advice' to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Cannie Soogah, is it possible you don't know me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Throth I've been just thinkin' that I heard the voice before, but when or
      where is more than I can tell."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not know your friend Francis M'Carthy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh, Mr. Francis M'Carthy! and, Lord o' life, Mr. M'Carthy, how do you
      come to have a black face? Surely you wouldn't belong to this business&mdash;black
      business I may call it&mdash;that's goin'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I should hope not, Cannie; but, for all that, you see me with a
      black face&mdash;ha!&mdash;ha!&mdash;ha!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do indeed, Mr. Frank, and, between you and me, I'm sorry to see it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will not be sorry to hear, however, that my black face saved my life
      last night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Arra thin, how was that, sir, if it's a fair question?"
    </p>
    <p>
      M'Carthy then gave him a brief, and by no means a detailed account of the
      danger he had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said the other, "everything's clear enough when it's known; but,
      as it's clear that you have enemies in the neighborhood, I think the
      wisest thing you could do would be to lave it at wanst."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such, in fact, is my determination," replied M'Carthy; "no man, I
      believe, who is marked ought to remain in the country; that is, when he
      has no local duties that demand his presence in it, as I have not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right, sir; start this very day if you're wise, and don't give
      your enemies&mdash;since it appears that you have enemies&mdash;an
      opportunity of doin' you an injury; if they missed you twice, it's not
      likely they will a third time; but tell me, Mr. M'Carthy&mdash;hem&mdash;have
      you no suspicion as to who they are?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not exactly; indeed I cannot say I have; the whole matter is shrouded in
      the deepest mystery. I am not conscious of having offended or injured any
      one, nor can I guess why my life should be sought after; but sought after
      unquestionably it is, and that with an implacable resentment that is
      utterly unaccountable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, Mr. Frank, listen:&mdash;I met about a dozen men&mdash;strangers
      they wor to me, although their faces weren't blackened&mdash;not more than
      twenty minutes ago; and one, o' them said to me, 'Cannie, every one knows'
      you, and you know every one&mdash;do you know me?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No,' says I; 'you have the advantage of me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Do you know any one here?' says he again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well, I can't say I do,' says I; 'you don't belong to this part of the
      country.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'If we did, Cannie,' said the spokesman, 'it isn't face to face, in the
      open day, we'd spake to you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'An' what is it you have to say to me?' I axed; for, to tell you the
      truth, I was beginnin' to get unaisy someway.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Nothing to you; but we've been tould that you're well acquainted wid
      Procthor Purcel, and that you know a young man, by name M'Carthy, that
      stops for the present wid Mr. Magistrate O'Driscol.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I do,' says myself; 'I'll not deny but I know them all well&mdash;I mane
      in the way o' business&mdash;for I call there often to sell my goods.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well,' said the spokesman, 'will you give that letther,' handin' me
      this, 'to Mr. M'Carthy?'" and as the pedlar spoke he placed the note in
      M'Carthy's hands. "'Do so,' says the fellow, 'as soon as you can&mdash;if
      possible, widout an hour's delay. It consarns himself and it consarns me&mdash;can
      I depend on you to do this?' I said I would: and now there's the letther&mdash;-my
      message is delivered."
    </p>
    <p>
      M'Carthy read as follows:&mdash;"Francis M'Carthy, as you regard the life
      of the man that saved yours last night, you won't breathe a syllable about
      seein' a young man's corpse last night in the shebeen-house, nor about
      anything that happened to you in it, till you hear further from me. If
      you're grateful, and a gintleman, you won't; but if you're a traitor, you
      will. Your friend, as you act in this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Mr. Frank," said the, pedlar, "as you know the danger that's about
      you, I say that unless you get out o' the counthry at wanst, you'll only
      have a hand in your own death if anything happens. You're, goin' now, I
      suppose, to Mr. Purcel's; if you are&mdash;if it wouldn't be troublesome&mdash;jist
      say that the Cannie Soogah will call there in the coorse o' the mornin'
      for breakfast."
    </p>
    <p>
      He then turned off by a different road; and M'Carthy proceeded at, a very
      slow pace towards the proctor's, which lay in a right line between the
      house to which the White-boy had brought him and O'Driscol's. As he
      reached the back yard, by which he intended to enter, anxious to get
      himself washed before any of them should see him&mdash;he was met by
      Mogue, who after a glance or two recognized him at once by his
      shooting-dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why thin, good fortune to me, Misther Frank, is this you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is, Mogue; but I have no time to speak to you now. Only get me soap
      and a towel till I wash my face at the pump here. These are strange times,
      Mogue, and that was a very suspicious place of refuge to which you brought
      me; however, it will go hard or we shall make Mr. Frank Finnerty speak
      out, and to some purpose too. Get me soap and towel quick&mdash;-I do not
      wish to be seen with this diabolical-looking face upon me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I may be blest, sir, but the same face surprises me. Wisha, then,
      Mr. Frank, might one ax&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied M'Carthy, "do as I have desired you&mdash;some other time
      you may hear it, but not now."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, Mogue, who was very circumspect in all his looks as well
      as in all his motions, saw by a side glance that Julia, on coming down the
      stairs, saw M'Carthy&mdash;a circumstance which delighted his very heart,
      inasmuch as he resolved to so manage it, that it might be made to confirm
      the hint he had already thrown out against M'Carthy&mdash;if that could be
      called a hint which was a broad and undisguised assertion. He accordingly
      watched until an opportunity presented itself of addressing her apart from
      listeners; and in the course of the morning, as she went to look after
      some favorite flowers in the garden, he met her at the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Julia," said he, "I wish to spake one word to you, i' you plaise,
      miss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Mogue, what is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know what I tould you about poor Misther Frank last night; and what I
      want to say, miss, is, that you aren't to put any trust in it; truth, I
      believe I had a sup in&mdash;don't be guided by it&mdash;it was only
      jokin' about him I was&mdash;that I may never do an ill turn but it was&mdash;now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You need make no apology about it, Mogue," she replied; "I am not at all
      interested in the matter; but I now know that you told me truth; and as a
      friend and well-wisher of Mr. M'Carthy's, in common with all my family, I
      am sorry to find it so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well now, miss, what will I do at all? wisha, but that's the way wid
      me ever and always; when the little sup is in&mdash;and indeed it wasn't
      much I tuck&mdash;the truth always come out&mdash;if it was the killin' of
      a man, my heart always gets the betther of ma then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw him, Mogue, with his face blackened."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wisha, wisha, but I was a haythen to mention it at all. The truth is, I
      like Mr. Frank&mdash;but then again, I don't like anything like desate, or
      that carries two faces&mdash;only as you did see him, Miss Julia, if
      you're loyal to me and won't turn traitor on me&mdash;you've but to wait
      for a little, I'll be able to tell you more about the same foolish&mdash;I'd
      rather say foolish for the sake of settin' a Christian pat-thern, than
      wicked or traicherous&mdash;och, ay&mdash;for sure we all have our failins&mdash;howandiver
      as I was sayin', I'll soon be able, I think, to tell you more about him&mdash;things
      that will surprise you, miss, ay, and make the blood in your veins run
      cowld. Only I say, if you wish to hear this, and to have it as clearly
      proved to you as what I tould you last night, you musn't betray me."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was spoken in such an earnest, and at the same time in so simple and
      candid a manner, that it was actually impossible to suspect for a moment
      that there was falsehood or treachery intended. Nay,&mdash;his pretended
      effort to undeceive her as to M'Carthy's connection with the Whiteboys,
      was such a natural step after the drink which she supposed he had taken on
      the preceding night, and when cool reflection had returned to him, that
      she felt an indescribable curiosity&mdash;one attended with pain and
      terror&mdash;to hear the full extent of her lover's perfidy. Beyond all
      doubt, Moylan's treacherous adroitness, and the simplicity and piety under
      which he contrived to veil his treachery and revenge, were perfect in
      their way. As it was, he succeeded in banishing peace, and trust, and
      cheerfulness, from the heart of generous and affectionate Julia Purcel.
    </p>
    <p>
      M'Carthy found the young men up, and after simply stating that the
      previous night was one of danger and adventure, he said that he wished to
      go to bed for a while, and that he would describe these adventures at more
      length after he had refreshed himself by some sleep. This, indeed, they
      perceived to be absolutely necessary, from his exhausted and pallid look.
      He accordingly went to rest&mdash;and, sooth to say, the sense of
      security, joined to his complete exhaustion, and the comforts of a warm
      good bed, gave him such a perception of luxury as he had never conceived
      before. In a few minutes he fell into a dreamless and unbroken trance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast was postponed an hour on his account; for as he had extorted a
      promise from John Purcel, that he should either call him or have him
      called when the time for that meal arrived, they did not wish to disturb
      him so soon. In the meantime, there was many a conjecture as to the cause
      of his absence, and as the fact of his black face could not be concealed,
      there was consequently many an opinion given as to the circumstances which
      occasioned that unexpected phenomenon. Julia did not at all appear, but
      pleaded indisposition, and Alick had not yet returned-from O'Driscol's, so
      there was only the proctor, his son John, his wife, and Mary, to discuss
      the matter. At length, about half-past ten M'Carthy made his appearance,
      and after the usual civilities of the morning, he gave them a pretty
      clear, but not a very detailed account of the dangers he had undergone.
      After a good deal of consideration, he resolved, in accordance with the
      wish of his unknown friend, to suppress all mention of the attack upon
      O'Driscol's house, and of the young man who had been shot whilst it was
      going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast had not been concluded, when the <i>Cannie Soogah</i>, who had
      already got his hansel, as he called his breakfast, in the kitchen, made
      his appearance at the parlor window, which was immediately thrown up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God save all here," he exclaimed, "long life and good health to every one
      of you! Here I am, the rantin' Cannie Soogah, as large as life; and upon
      my profits maybe a little larger if the truth was known."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cannie," said the proctor, "dix me, but I'm glad to see you&mdash;and how
      are you, man?&mdash;and do you carry your bones safe&mdash;or your head
      upon your shoulders at all, durin' these wild times?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Troth, and you may well say they're wild times, Mr. Purcel, and it'll be
      wisdom in every one to keep themselves as safe as possible till they mend.
      Is it thruth, sir, that you're makin' preparations to collect your tides
      wid the help o' the sogers and polis?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly thrue, Cannie; we'll let the rascals that are misleading the
      people, as well as the people themselves, know whether they or the law are
      the strongest. They cannot blame us for the consequence, for we're forced
      to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There will be bad work, thin, I'm afeard, sir; and bloody work, I dread."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's not our fault, Cannie, but the fault of those who will wilfully
      violate the law. However, let that pass, what's the news in the world?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you hard, sir, that the house of your friend and neighbor, that
      man that hears nothin'&mdash;" here there was the slightest perceptible
      grin upon the pedlar's face&mdash;"was attacked last night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't mean O'Driscol's?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my profits, I do&mdash;an' nobody else's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hillo! do you hear this, girls? O'Driscol's house was attacked last
      night!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heavenly father! I hope Alick is safe," exclaimed Mrs. Purcel, getting
      pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Cannie," inquired the proctor, quite coolly, and as if it was a
      matter of mere business, "what was the consequence? I hope nobody was
      hurt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, that his son Fergus, sir&mdash;that fine young man that everybody
      was fond of&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good God!" exclaimed the proctor, now really shocked at what he supposed
      the pedlar was about to say; "what is it you are goin' to tell us? I hope
      in God&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is this!" exclaimed John; "heavens, Mary, you have spilled all the
      tea!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mary, my child," exclaimed the mother, running to her; "what ails you?&mdash;in
      God's name, what is the matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A sudden faintness," replied the girl, recovering herself as if by an
      effort; "but it is over, and I&mdash;I am better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "His son Fergus, sir&mdash;I hope Miss Mary is betther, sir&mdash;that his
      son Fergus and his father, by all accounts, gave them a warmer reception
      than they expected."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But was none of O'Driscol's family hurt nor anybody else?" asked Purcel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir, it seems not&mdash;and indeed I'm main glad of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "D&mdash;n you, Cannie," exclaimed the other, between jest and earnest,
      "why did you give me such a start? You told the affair as if Fergus had
      been shot&mdash;however, I'm glad that all's safe in O'Driscol's;&mdash;but
      about the night-boys? Were there any lives lost among them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's thought not, sir," replied the pedlar. "They left the marks o' blood
      behind them, but the general opinion is, that there was no life lost; I
      hope there wasn't&mdash;for, indeed, I have such a hatred against the
      shed-din' of blood, that I don't wish even to hear of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was their object, have you learned, in attacking O'Driscol's place?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, I didn't hear; but anyhow, they say that a new workin' boy of
      O'Driscol's, that dogged them up beyant Darby Hourigan's, was wounded by
      them, along with Darby himself, in regard, of his having joined the young
      fellow in dodgin' afther them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are they seriously hurt?" asked John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Throth that's more than I can say, but I hope they're not, poor fellows;
      at any rate, I'm sure Mr. O'Driscol will have them well taken care of till
      they're recovered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," observed the proctor, "if he thinks it his duty he will: my
      friend O'Driscol will do what he conceives to be right."
    </p>
    <p>
      The pedlar nodded significantly, and honored the observation with, a broad
      grin. "Well, sir," said he, changing the conversation, "he may do for that
      as he likes, but I must look to number one. Come, ladies&mdash;and, by the
      way, where's my favorite, Miss Julia&mdash;from you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's not quite well this morning, Cannie," said her mother; "she has a
      slight headache, I believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Miss Mary, then? Any purchases to-day, Miss Mary?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not to-day, Cannie&mdash;the next time, perhaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cannie," said Purcel, "you praised your razors very highly at your last
      visit;&mdash;have you a good case this morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't I, sir? Wait till you see them."
    </p>
    <p>
      He then produced a case, which the proctor purchased, and thus closed his
      sales for that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pedlar, however, notwithstanding that his commercial transactions had
      been concluded, seemed somehow in no hurry. On the contrary, he took up
      his pack and exclaimed, "I must go back to the kitchen, till I see what
      can be done there in the way of business; hearin' that you were finishin'
      breakfast, I hurried up here to sell my goods and have my chat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, Cannie," said the proctor, "try the folks below, and success
      to you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The pedlar once more sought the kitchen, where he lingered in fact more
      like a man who seemed fatigued than otherwise, inasmuch as his eyes
      occasionally closed, and his head nodded, in spite of him. He kept,
      however, constantly watching and peeping into the yard and lawn from time
      to time, as if he expected to see somebody. At length he got tip and was
      about to go, when he said to Letty Lenehan:&mdash;"Ah, thin, Letty, afore
      I go I'd give a trifle that Miss Julia 'ud see a bracelet I got since I
      was here last; divil sich a beauty ever was seen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, Cannie, I'll tell her if you wish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, Letty, may it rain honeycombs an you, an' do. I'll go round to the
      hall-door, 'say, and she can look at them there; an' see, Letty, say the
      sorra foot I'll go from the place till she sees it: that it'll be worth
      her while; and that if she knew how I got it, she'd fly&mdash;if she had
      wings&mdash;to get a glimpse of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not been more than a minute or two at the hall-door when Julia,
      struck by the earnestness of the man's language, which lost nothing in the
      transmission, made her appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well now, Cannie," said she, "what wonderful matter is this you have got
      to show me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here it is, Miss Julia," said he, in his usual jocular and somewhat loud
      voice, "here it is, I'll have it in a minute&mdash;listed, Miss Julia," he
      added, in a solemn and impressive undertone: "what I'm goin' to say is
      more to you than aither life or death. Don't go out by yourself&mdash;don't
      go at all out early in the morning or late in the evenin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so, Cannie?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, miss, it came to me by accident only; but the truth is there's a
      plot laid, it seems, to carry you off to the mountains."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By whom, Cannie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the very thing, miss, that I don't know; but a strange man met me
      on my way here this mornin' and tould me that he was a friend to your
      father&mdash;who was wanst a friend to him&mdash;and that, if I'd see you,
      to put you on your guard against goin' either to the poor or sick at the
      hours I spoke of; and he bid me say, too, that there's bad work and
      thraichery about you&mdash;and by no manner o' means to go any distance
      from your father's house&mdash;ay, thraichery, an from them you'd never
      think o' suspectin' for it. Now, miss, keep this counsel to yourself, and
      don't say it was I that tould you, but as you love a fair name and an
      unblemished character, act upon it. Dang me," he added, "but I had like to
      forget&mdash;if any message&mdash;I was bid to tell you&mdash;should come
      from Widow Lynch's, sayin' that her daughter's dyin' and wishes to see
      you, and that it's afther dusk it'll come&mdash;if it does come&mdash;well,
      if any sich message is sent to you, don't go&mdash;nor don't go for any
      message, no matther what it is&mdash;hem&mdash;ahem&mdash;oh! here I have
      it at last miss," he exclaimed in his natural voice, "isn't that a
      beauty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia got as pale as death for a moment, and then her brow became crimson
      with indignation. In fact, she saw not his bracelet&mdash;nor heard what
      he said in praise of it; but after a little time she said, "Thank you,
      Cannie, most seriously do I thank you&mdash;and you may rest assured I
      shall faithfully follow your advice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do so, miss," he replied, "so God bless you and take care of you! and
      that's the worst the rantin Cannie Soogah wishes you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alick Purcel almost immediately joined the family in the parlor, to whom
      he related a full and somewhat ludicrous account of the seige of O'Driscol
      Castle, as he called it&mdash;or Nassau Lodge. As our readers, however,
      are already aware of the principal particulars of that attack, we shall
      only briefly recapitulate what they already know, and confine ourselves to
      merely one portion of it, in which portion our doughty and heroic friend,
      the magistrate, was most peculiarly concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Having tested the martial magistrate's courage," he proceeded, "by a hint
      from Fergus, who was as much amused by it as I was, and finding that it
      was of the oozing or Bob Acres quality, we resolved, on hearing that the
      house was surrounded, to examine, and prime and load all the fire-arms in
      the house, as the case demanded. Some had been already loaded, but at all
      events we looked to them, and such as were uncharged we loaded on the
      spot, and then threw ourselves on the bed without undressing, in order
      that we might be ready for a surprise. Fergus and I, after having lain
      awake for a considerable time, taking it for granted that they had given
      up all intention of attacking the house, at length fell into a kind of
      wakeful doze from which we were at once aroused by a loud knocking at the
      hall-door. We quietly opened the drawing-room windows, and in a firm tone
      demanded what they wanted, and the answer was, that a friend of M'Carthy's
      wished very much to settle an account with him. We replied he was not in
      the house, and that even if he were, they should fight for him before they
      got him. We also told them our opinion of their conduct, and said, that if
      they did not leave the place, we would scatter the contents of a
      blunderbuss among them. I should state that they knew my voice, and said
      that they didn't want me then, but that my turn would come soon. When we
      had done speaking, a strong mellow voice, which I'll swear was not strange
      to me, said something to them in Irish, and the next moment the windows
      were shivered with bullets. Fortunately, we kept ourselves out of their
      range; but at all events, we had light enough to see them put their
      fire-arms to their shoulders, and time enough to stand aside. We returned
      the fire instantly, but whether with any fatal effect or not we could not
      say. When the smoke cleared away they had disappeared, but early this
      morning traces of blood were found on the spot. A servant of O'Driscol's,
      named Phil Hart, says they received no injury, for that he followed them
      at a distance up as far as Darby Hourigan's, near whose door they fired a
      couple of shots. Darby, it appears, joined Hart, having been aroused by
      the report of fire-arms; and both, on being discovered on their track,
      were fired at and wounded. Hart says it is his blood that is on the lawn,
      and perhaps it may be so, but I rather think the fellows did not escape
      scot-free at any rate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But where," asked John, "was the magistrate all this time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's precisely what I am coming to," replied Alick; "the fact was that
      the martial magistrate, who, I believe in my soul, lay shivering with
      terror on his bed the whole previous part of the night, on hearing our
      dialogue with the Whiteboys, and the report of the fire-arms, altogether
      disappeared, and it was not until two or three searches had been made for
      him, that he was discovered squatted three double in the coalhole. On
      hearing and recognizing our voices, he started up, and commenced searching
      round him in the aforesaid coal-hole. 'Come, sir!' he exclaimed, in a
      voice of most ludicrous swagger, 'come, you scoundrel! I'll unkennel you&mdash;whoever
      may be afraid of you, I'm not&mdash;my name's O'Driscol, sirra&mdash;Fitzgerald
      O'Driscol, commonly called for brevity's sake, Fitzy O'Driscol&mdash;a
      name, sir, that ought to strike terror into you&mdash;and if it didn't, it
      isn't here I'd be hunting you&mdash;out with you now&mdash;surrendher, I
      say, or if you don't upon my honor and conscience you're a dead man.'
      'What's the matter, sir?' I asked&mdash;'in Heaven's name, who have you
      there?' 'Who is in the coalhole, father?' asked Fergus, with a face whose
      gravity showed wonderful strength of muscle. 'Yes, gentlemen,' replied the
      magistrate 'heroes that you are&mdash;riflemen from a window&mdash;upon my
      honor and conscience, I think courage is like the philosopher's stone&mdash;here
      have I, while you were popping like schoolboys out of the window, pursued
      their leader single-handed into the coal-hole, for I'm sure he's in it, or
      if not, he must have escaped some other way&mdash;d&mdash;n the villain, I
      hope he hasn't escaped, at all events&mdash;here, lights, I say, and guard
      all the passes&mdash;d&mdash;n it, let us do our business with proper
      discipline and skill&mdash;fall back, Fergus&mdash;and you, John, advance&mdash;steady
      now&mdash;charge the coal-hole, boys, and I'll lead you on to the danger.'
      Of course he was half drunk, but at the same time he managed to conceal
      his cowardice with considerable adroitness. I need not say that upon
      examining the coal-hole, and every other possible place of concealment
      there was no desperate leader found, nor any proof obtained that an
      entrance had been effected at all. 'Well, come,' exclaimed O'Driscol,
      'although the villain has escaped, we managed the thing well&mdash;all of
      us&mdash;he must have given me the slip from the kitchen and leaped out of
      a window. You acted well, boys; and as I like true courage and resolution&mdash;ay,
      an' if you like, downright desperation&mdash;being a bit of a dare-devil
      myself&mdash;I say I will give you a glass of brandy-and-water each, and
      the intrepid old veteran will take one himself. Ah! wait till my friend
      the Castle hears of this exploit&mdash;upon my sowl and honor, it will be
      a feather in my cap.' Fergus whispered to me, 'It ought to be a white one,
      then.' We accordingly adjourned in the dining-room, where after having
      finished a tumbler of brandy-and-water each, we at length went to bed, and
      thus closed the seige of O'Driscol Castle."
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia on hearing of this attack and its object, felt her mind involved in
      doubt and embarrassment. She could not reconcile the desire of the
      Whiteboys to injure M'Carthy, with the fact of his having, by his own
      admission, spent the night among them. Or what if the attack was a mere
      excuse to prevent any suspicion of his connection with them at all? She
      knew not, and until she had arrived at some definite view of the matter,
      she resolved to keep as much aloof from M'Carthy as she could possiby do
      without exciting observation. In the course of the morning, however, they
      met accidentally, and the short dialogue which took place between her and
      him did not at all help to allay the suspicions with which her mind was
      burdened and oppressed.

    <p>
      "My dear Julia," said he, "I see that you are offended with me, but indeed
      you need not; I can give you a full and satisfactory explanation of my
      black face, if that be the cause of offence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some other time, Mr. M'Carthy, I may hear your explanation; but not just
      now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot bear your displeasure," he added; "and you know it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you had felt as anxious not to deserve it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am unconscious of having deserved it&mdash;but hear me, dearest Julia&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sir, I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you not go to see Widow Lynch's poor sick daughter this evening?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir, and well, sir&mdash;good heavens! what means this all?&mdash;I
      am anxious, I say, to give you a full explanation, and if you would only
      pay a visit this evening to the widow's, I could meet you and explain
      everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cannie Soogah's warning here pressed upon her mind with peculiar
      force.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," she replied, "I shall not go this evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, will you say what evening you intend to go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir," she replied; "I don't intend to go in future, either morning or
      evening. Good-bye, Mr. M'Carthy, some time must elapse before I can listen
      to your explanation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this generous, Julia?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe it is just, Frank. Ask your own conscience, whether you are
      entitled to any confidence from me&mdash;good-bye."
    </p>
    <p>
      And with these words, she tripped up to the drawing-room, where she joined
      her mother and sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      M'Carthy, after having settled down from the tumult occasioned by these
      cowardly and murderous attempts upon his life, could not help indulging in
      the deepest indignation against the vile and unmanly systems of secret
      confederation in crime, by which the country was infested and disgraced;
      its industry marred, its morality debauched, and its love of truth changed
      into the practice of dissimulation, falsehood, and treachery. He
      accordingly determined, as far as in him lay, to penetrate the mystery,
      and ascertain the danger by which he was surrounded, and if possible, to
      punish his unmanly and ferocious enemies. He consequently lodged
      informations against Frank Finnerty, for whose apprehension a warrant was
      issued; but thanks to the kind services of his friend Mogue Moylan,
      Finnerty was duly forewarned, and when our friend, the heroic O'Driscol,
      armed to the teeth, and accompanied by as many police as would have
      captured a whole village, arrived at and surrounded his house, he found
      that the bird had flown, and left nothing but empty walls behind him.

      CHAPTER XIV.&mdash;State of the Country
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &mdash;O'Driscol rivals Falstaff&mdash;Who Buck English was supposed to
      be.
    </h3>
    <p>
      M'Carthy, on finding that he had failed, in consequence of the
      disappearance of Finnerty, in developing the system which nurtured such
      cowardly and inhuman principles, now found it necessary, independent of
      all threats uttered against him, to return to college in order to
      prosecute his studies, and maintain the high position which he had there
      obtained by honors already won, and the general brilliancy of his
      answering. A kind of love-quarrel had taken place between himself and
      Julia Purcel, which, as is frequently the case, prevented him on the one
      side from giving, and her on the other, from receiving an explanation. The
      consequence was that they separated, each laboring under that yearning of
      the heart towards the other, which combines the most delicious sensations
      connected with the passion&mdash;tenderness disguised under an impression
      of offence, hope, uncertainty, and that awful anger that is never to
      forgive or change, but which, in the meantime, is furtively seeking for an
      opportunity to be reconciled, and vent its rage in kisses and in tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, the state of the country was fast becoming such as had
      seldom, or perhaps never been recollected by living man. The
      confederation, conspiracy, opposition, rebellion, or what you will, had
      risen to a gigantic height. In point of fact, it ought rather to have been
      termed an unarmed insurrection. Passive resistance was the order and the
      practice of the day. The people were instructed by the agitators, or
      rather by the great agitator himself, to oppose the laws without violating
      them; a piece of advice which involved an impossibility in the first
      place, but which was as false in itself, as replete with dishonesty and
      imposture, as it was deceitful and treacherous to the poor people who were
      foolish and credulous enough to be influenced by it. We are not now
      assailing the Whigs for the reforms which they effected in the Irish
      establishment, because we most cordially approve of them. Nay, more, we
      are unquestionably of opinion that that reform was not only the boldest,
      the most brilliant, but the most just and necessary act of policy, which
      they ever offered as a boon to this country. But what we do blame them for
      is, that they should have suffered themselves to be kept in such gross
      ignorance of the state of the Irish church, as to allow its shocking and
      monstrous corruptions to remain uncorrected so long; that they should have
      allowed themselves to be baffled and imposed upon, and misled by the
      hypocritical howlings and fictitious alarms of the old Tory party, who,
      whenever they felt the slightest dread that the Irish Establishment would
      slip through their fingers, filled heaven and earth with prophetic
      denunciations against England, not forbearing to threaten the very throne
      itself with a general alienation of Protestant attachment and allegiance,
      if any of its worst and rottenest corruptions should be touched. No; the
      Whigs should have known the state and condition of the Irish church from
      clear and correct sources, and not have subjected the country to the
      pernicious and degrading consequences of a turbulent agitation. What is
      just in itself ought to be conceded to reason and utility, and not
      withheld until violence and outrage seem to extort it; for this only holds
      out a bounty to future agitation. Be this as it may, the whole country, at
      the period of which we write, was in a state of general commotion and
      tumult altogether unparalleled. Law was completely paralyzed, set at
      defiance, and laughed at. Large bodies, consisting of many thousands,
      traversed different parts of the country in open day, swearing every one
      they met to resist the payment of tithes in every way and in every sense.
      Many gentlemen, who had either paid it or been suspected to do so, or who
      had been otherwise obnoxious as landlords, or for strong party feeling,
      were visited by these licentious multitudes with an intention of being put
      to death, whilst the houses of several wealthy farmers, who had
      unfortunately paid the hated impost, were wrecked in the face of day. Nor
      was this all: men were openly and publicly marked for destruction, and
      negotiations for their murder entered into in fairs, and markets, and
      houses of entertainment, without either fear or disguise. In such a state
      of things, it is unnecessary to say that many lives were taken, and that
      great outrages were from time to time committed. Two or three clergymen
      were murdered, several tithe-proctors or collectors of tithe were beaten
      nearly to death; and to such a pitch did the opposition rise, that at
      length it became impossible to find any one hardy and intrepid, or, in
      other words, mad enough, to collect tithe, unless under the protection
      either of the military or police. Our friends, Proctor Purcel and his
      sons, were now obliged, not merely to travel armed, but frequently under
      the escort of police. Their principal dread, however, was from an attack
      upon their premises at night; and, as fearful threats were held out that
      such an attack would be made, Purcel, who, as the reader knows, was a man
      of great wealth, engaged men to build a strong and high wall about his
      house and out-offices, which could now be got at only through a gate of
      immense strength, covered with thick sheet-iron, and bound together by
      bars of the same metal, in such a way that even the influence of fire
      could not destroy it, or enable an enemy to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      With such a condition of society before us, it is scarcely necessary to
      inform our readers that the privations of the Protestant clergy were not
      only great, but dreadful and without precedent. It was not merely that
      their style of living was lowered or changed for the worse, but that they
      suffered distress of the severest description&mdash;want, destitution, and
      hunger, in their worst forms. First came inconvenience from a delay in the
      receipt of their incomes; then the necessity of asking for a longer term
      of credit; after this the melancholy certainty that tithes would not be
      paid; again followed the pressure from creditors for payment, with its
      distracting and harassing importunities; then the civil but firm refusal
      to supply the necessaries of life on further credit; then again the
      application to friends, until either the inclination or ability failed,
      and benevolence itself was exhausted. After this came the disposal of
      books, furniture, and apparel; and, when these failed, the secret grapple
      with destitution, the broken spirit, the want of food&mdash;famine,
      hunger, disease, and, in some cases, death itself. These great sufferings
      of a class who, at all events, were educated gentlemen, did not occur
      without exciting, on their behalf, deep and general sympathy from all
      classes. In their prosperity, the clergy, as a body, raised and spent
      their income in the country. They had been kind and charitable to the
      poor, and their wives and daughters had often been ministering angels to
      those who were neglected by the landlords or gentry of the neighborhood,
      their natural protectors. It is true, an insurrection exhibiting the
      manifestation of a general and hostile principle against the source of
      their support, had spread over the country; but, notwithstanding its force
      and violence, the good that they had done was not forgotten to them in the
      hour of their trials and their sorrows. Many a man, for instance, whose
      voice was loud in the party procession, and from whose lips the shout of
      "down with the blood-stained tithe!" issued with equal fervor and
      sincerity, was often known to steal, at the risk of his very life, in the
      dead hour of night, to the house of, the starving parson and his worn
      family, and with blackened face, that he might not by any possibility be
      known, pay the very tithes for whose abolition he was willing to peril his
      life. Nay, what is more, the priest himself&mdash;the actual living
      idolatrous priest, the benighted minister of the Scarlet Lady, has often
      been known to bring, upon his own broad and sturdy shoulders, that relief
      in substantial food which has saved the lives of more than one of those
      ungodly parsons, who had fattened upon a heretic church, and were the
      corrupted supporters of the mammon of unrighteousness. Here, in fact, was
      the popish, bigoted priest&mdash;the believer in transubstantiation, the
      denouncer of political enemies, the advocate of exclusive salvation, the
      fosterer of pious frauds, the "surpliced ruffian," as he has been called,
      and heaven knows what besides, stealing out at night, loaded like a mule,
      with provisions for the heretical parson and his family&mdash;for the
      Bible-man, the convent-hunter, the seeker after filthy lucre, and the
      black slug who devoured one-tenth of the husbandman's labors. Such, in
      fact, was the case in numberless instances, where the very priest himself
      durst not with safety render open assistance to his ecclesiastical enemy,
      the parson.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this combination against tithe, it is to be observed, that, as in all
      other agitations, whether the object be good or otherwise, those who took
      a principal part among the people in the rural districts were seldom any
      other than the worst and most unprincipled spirits&mdash;reckless ruffians
      and desperate vagabonds, without any sense of either religious or moral
      obligation to restrain them from the commission of outrage. It is those
      men, unfortunately, who, possessed of strong and licentious energies, and
      always the most active and contaminating in every agitation that takes
      place among us, and who, influenced by neither shame nor fear, and
      regardless of consequences, impress their disgraceful character upon the
      country at large, and occasion the great body of society to suffer the
      reproach of that crime and violence which, after all, only comparatively a
      few commit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our friend the proctor, we have already stated, had collected the tithes
      of three or four parishes; and it is unnecessary, therefore, to say, that
      the hostility against him was spread over a wide and populous district.
      This was by no means the case with O'Driscol, who was much more the object
      of amusement to the people than of enmity. The mask of bluster, and the
      cowardly visage it covered, were equally well known in the neighborhood;
      and as the Irish possess a quick and almost instinctive perception of
      character, especially among their superiors, we need scarcely say that
      they played off, on more than one occasion, many ludicrous pranks at his
      expense. He was certainly a man of great importance, at least in his own
      opinion, or if he did understand himself, he wished, at all events, to be
      considered so in the eyes of others. He possessed, however, much more
      cunning than any one would feel inclined to attribute to him, and powers
      of flattery that were rarely ever equalled. He was, in fact, one of the
      few men who could administer that nauseating dose, without permitting the
      person who received it to become sensible that he did so. He had scraped
      together some wealth by the good oldsystem of jobbing&mdash;had got
      himself placed upon the Grand Panel of the county,' and ultimately, by
      some corrupt influence at an election, contrived to have the merit of
      returning the government candidate, a service which procured him a
      magistracy. O'Driscol was very fond of magnifying trifles, and bestowing,
      a character of importance upon matters that were of the utmost
      insignificance. For instance, if a poor decrepit devil, starving in a hut,
      and surrounded by destitution and beggary, were to be arrested for some
      petty misdemeanor, he would mount his horse with vast pomp, and proceed at
      the head of twelve or eighteen armed policemen to make his caption. But,
      on the contrary, whenever any desperate and intrepid character was to be
      apprehended&mdash;some of those fellows like the notorious Ryan (Puck),
      who always carried a case of pistols or a blunderbuss about them, or
      perhaps both&mdash;-our valiant magistrate was either out of the way or
      had a visit from the gout&mdash;a complaint which he was very fond of
      parading, because it is one of aristocratic pretensions, but one, of
      which, we are honestly bound to say, he had never experienced a single
      twitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have already stated that he had received a threatening notice, and
      attempted to describe the state of conflicting emotions into which it
      threw him. We forgot to state, however, that he had before received
      several other anonymous communications of a somewhat more friendly stamp;
      the difference between them being the simple fact, that the one in
      question was read, and the others of his own composition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter were indeed all remarkable for containing one characteristic
      feature, which consisted in a solemn but friendly warning that if he (the
      magistrate) were caught at a particular place, upon a particular day, it
      might be attended with dangerous consequences to himself. Our magistrate,
      however, was not a man to be frightened by such communications; no,&mdash;He
      was well known in the neighborhood, and he would let the cowardly
      scoundrels feel what a determined man could be. He thought his daredevil
      character had been sufficiently known; but since it seemed that it was
      not, he would teach them a lesson of intrepidity&mdash;the scoundrels. His
      practice was, on such occasions, to get a case of pistols, mount his
      horse, and, in defiance to all entreaty to the contrary, proceed to the
      place of danger, which he rode past, and examined with an air of pompous
      heroism that was ludicrous in the extreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, about this time, he sat at breakfast, reading the
      Potwollopers' Gazette, or the No-Popery Advocate, when, as usual, he laid
      it down, and pushing it over to Fergus, he resumed his toast and butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, now," said he, upon my honor and conscience, it is extraordinary
      how these matters creep into the papers. At all events, Fergus, my friend
      the Castle will persaive what kind of stuff it's best supporters consist
      of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very appropriate, sir," replied Fergus&mdash;"stuff is an excellent
      word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why is it an excellent word, Fergy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is so significant, sir, as an illustration?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I dare say it is," returned the father; "don't we say of a game
      man, such a fellow has good stuff in him? but, setting that aside, do look
      at the paragraph about that attack! My friend Swiggerly has done me full
      justice. Upon my word, it is extramely gratifying, and especially in such
      critical times as these, read it for Kate there, will you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, papa?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An account, my dear, of the attack made upon us, and of&mdash;but Fergus
      will read it out for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Fergus accordingly read as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      EXTRAORDINARY COURAGE AND INTREPIDITY&mdash;SEVERAL HUNDRED WHITEBOYS MOST
      SPIRITLY REPULSED&mdash;FITZGERALD O'DRISCOL, ESQ. J. P.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the night of the 24th ultimo, the house of this most active and
      resolute magistrate was attacked by a numerous band of ruffianly
      Whiteboys, amounting to several hundreds&mdash;who, in defiance of his
      well-known resolution, and forgetting the state of admirable preparation
      and defence in which he always maintains his dwelling-house, surrounded it
      with the intention, evidently, of visiting upon him the consequences of
      his extraordinary efforts at preserving the peace of the country, and
      bringing offenders to justice. The exact particulars of this fearful
      conflict have not reached us, but we may, without offence, we trust, to
      the modesty of Mr. O'Driscol, venture to give a general outline of the
      circumstances, as far as we have heard them. About two o'clock, on the
      morning alluded to, and while the whole family were asleep, an attempt was
      made to break open the hall-door. This, however, having been heavily
      chained, barred, and bolted, and the keys removed to Mr. O'Driscol's
      sleeping-room, resisted all attempts of the Whiteboys to enter&mdash;a
      circumstance which filled them with fury and indignation. In a moment the
      family were alarmed, and up. On that night it so happened that Mr. Alick
      Purcel, a friend and neighbor of Mr. O'Driscol's, happened to be staying
      with them, and almost immediately Mr. O'Driscol, placing the two young men
      in something like a steady military position, led them on personally, in
      the most intrepid manner, to a position behind the shutters. From this
      place the fire of the enemy was returned for a considerable time with
      equal bravery, and, it is presumed, effect, as the grounds about the
      hall-door were found the next morning to be stained with blood in several
      places. Tho heroism of the night, however, is yet to be related. Mr.
      O'Driscol, who was certainly supported by his son and Mr. Purcel in a most
      able and effective manner, hearing a low, cautious noise in the back part
      of the house, went to reconnoitre, just in time to grapple with the leader
      of these villains&mdash;a most desperate and ferocious character-cruel,
      fearless, and of immense personal strength. He must have got in by some
      unaccountable means not yet discovered, with the hope, of course, of
      admitting his accomplices from without. A terrific struggle now ensued,
      which terminated by the fellow, on finding, we presume, the mettle of the
      person opposed to him, flying down stairs towards the kitchen, and from
      thence, as Mr. O'Driscol thought, to the coal-hole, whether he fearlessly
      pursued him, but in vain. On examining the coal-hole, which Mr. O'Driscol
      did personally in the dark&mdash;we really shudder at that gentleman's
      absence of all fear&mdash;the ferocious Whiteboy could not be found in it.
      The presumption is that he gave Mr. O'Driscol the slip during pursuit,
      doubled back, and escaped from the lobby window, which, on examination,
      was found open. On this almost unprecedented act of bravery it is useless
      to indulge in comment, especially as we are restrained by regard for Mr.
      O'Driscol's personal feelings and well-known modesty on this peculiar
      subject. His worthy son, we are aware, inherits his father's courage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The devil I do!" exclaimed Fergus; "ha! ha! ha! Faith, I'm braver than I
      had given myself credit for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And we are glad to hear that the present government, sensible of their
      obligations to Fitzgerald O'Driscol, Esq., are about to confer the office
      of Stipendiary Magistrate upon his son. We are, indeed, glad to hear this;
      the office cannot possibly be better bestowed; and thus, so far as relates
      to his father, at least, may valuable public services in critical times be
      ever appropriately rewarded!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Fergy, what do you think of our friend Swiggerly now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In God's name, sir, what does all this rigmarole, in which there is
      scarcely a word of truth, mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mane! why it manes, sir, that I am anxious to get you a Stipendiary
      Magistracy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A Stipendiary Magistracy, father, if you wish and if you can; but not by
      such means as this&mdash;it is shameful, father, indeed it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you, Fergus, that unless a man plays a game in this world, he has
      little business in it. Manes! Why, what objections can you have to the
      manes? A bit of a harmless paragraph that contains very little more than
      the truth. I tell you that I threw it out as a hint to my friend the
      Castle, and I hope it will act on it, that's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well," exclaimed the son, laughing, "take care you don't overdo the
      business; for my own part, I wish to obtain a magistracy only by honorable
      means;&mdash;that is, since you have put the matter into my head, for
      until last week I never once thought of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Neither did I until a couple of weeks ago; and between you and me,
      Fergus, the country's in a devil of a state&mdash;a very trying one for
      Stipendiaries," replied his father; "but it struck me that I am myself
      rather advanced in years for such an appointment, and, in the meantime,
      that something of the kind might be in your way, and it is for this rason
      that I am feeling the pulse of my friend the Castle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I am too young, sir, for such an appointment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all, you blockhead; although you get a magistracy in the
      paragraph, you don't imagine, I expect, you should get one directly. No,
      no; there are gradations in all things. For instance, now,&mdash;first a
      Chief Constableship of Police; next, a County Inspectorship; and thirdly,
      a Stipendiary Magistracy. It is aisy to run you through the two first in
      ordher to plant you in the third&mdash;eh? As for me I'm snug enough,
      unless they should make me a commissioner, of excise or something of that
      sort, that would not call me out upon active duty but, at all events,
      there's nothing like having one's eye to business, and being on the
      lookout for an opportunity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know, father," observed Fergus, "I don't now nor ever did approve of
      the system, or principle you pursue in these matters, and as I will not
      join you in them, I can only say if I do receive a government appointment,
      I shall not owe it to anything personally unbecoming myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you're young and green yet, Fergus, but time and expariance will,
      open your eyes to your own interests, and you'll live to acknowledge the
      folly of having scruples with the world&mdash;ay will you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may be so, sir; but I thank God the time you speak of has not come
      yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," continued his father, "now that we have talked over that matter,
      read this;",and, as he spoke, he handed Fergus a notice, evidently a
      friendly one, to the following; effect&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hunda.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. O'Driscol.&mdash;It's said that ye're to goto Lisnagola on Shoosda
      next. Now I tel ye there's a set upon yer life&mdash;don't go on that day,
      or it'll bee worser for ye&mdash;any way don't pass Philpot's corner
      betuxt 2 and fore o'cluck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A FRIEND THAT YEW WANST SAVED."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you think of that, Fergus?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, sir, it's a proof that you have friends among these turbulent
      people. I hope you don't intend going to Lisnagola on that day; by the way
      it must mean this day, for this is Tuesday, and the note or notice, or
      whatever you call it, is dated on Sunday, I perceive. I trust you don't
      intend to to-day, sir, and expose yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall certainly go, sir," replied his father, rising up quite
      indignantly. "What do you think I am? Do you think, sir, that I&mdash;Fitzgerald
      O'Driscol, am the man to be intimidated by blood-thirsty dogs like these?
      No, sir. I shall, at the proper time, arm myself, mount my good horse and
      ride, calm as a milestone, past the very spot. D&mdash;n the rascals! do
      they think to terrify me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the author of that letter does," replied Fergus, "he is most certainly
      mistaken;" and as he said so he looked significantly at his sister, who
      smiled as one would who thoroughly understood the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at that moment, Alick Purcel was seen approaching the hall-door, and
      in a few minutes he joined them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Alick," said the magistrate, "all well at Longshot Lodge&mdash;all
      safe and sound for so far?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All well, sir, thank you, and safe and sound for so far."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know what I think, Alick?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my honor and conscience I am of opinion, that it's something in your
      favor to live so near to me. I act as a kind of protection for you, Alick.
      I am morally convinced, ay, and have good raison to know it from more than
      one quarther, that your father's house would have been attacked long
      since, if it were not for the near neighborhood of dare-devil O'Driscol.
      And yet these fellows like courage, Alick; for instance, read that
      warning. There you see is a plot laid for my life; but I'll show the
      villains that they have the wrong sow by the ear. I have showed them as
      much before, and will show them as much again."
    </p>
    <p>
      He then handed the note, with an air of triumph, to Alick, who read it
      over and assumed a look of great terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you will be guided by this, Mr. O'Driscol."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I will not, Mr. Purcel; not a bit of it. I will ride&mdash;armed,
      of course&mdash;past Philpot's corner this very day, at half-past three
      o'clock; that is all I say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well all I can say," returned Alick, "is that you are a
      fearfully-determined man, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I grant that, Alick, I know I am; but then it is in my nature. I was born
      with it&mdash;I was born with it. Any news?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not much, sir. That scoundrel, Buck English, has written to my
      father, notwithstanding all that happened, to know if he will consent to
      let Julia marry him. He says in his letter that, although he may be put
      off with a refusal now, he will take good care that he shan't be
      unsuccessful the next time he asks her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does nobody, or can nobody find out how that scoundrel&mdash;" here the
      valorous magistrate's voice sank as if instinctively, and he gave a
      cautious glance about him at the same time, but seeing none but
      themselves, present he resumed his courage&mdash;"how that, rascal finds
      manes to cut the figure he-does?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe not," replied the other; "but for my part, I am often disposed
      to look upon the man as mad; yet still the puzzle is to think how he lives
      in such buck style&mdash;the vagabond. He certainly is involved in
      some-mystery, for every one you meet or talk to is afraid of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not every one, Alick; come, come, my boy, every general rule has an
      exception; whisper&mdash;I could name you one who is not afraid of him"&mdash;and
      this he said in a jocular tone&mdash;"I only wish," he added, raising his
      voice with more confidence, "that I could get my thumb upon him, I would&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was here interrupted by a loud but mellow voice, which rang cheerfully
      with the following words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm the rantin' Cannie Soogah."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha! the Jolly Pedlar! Throw open the window, Fergus, till we have a chat
      with him. Well, my rantin' Cannie Soogah, how are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith, your honor, I'm jist betwixt and between, as they say&mdash;naither
      betther nor worse, but mixed middlin', like the praties in harvest.
      However, it's good to be any way at all in these times; so thank God my
      head's on my body still."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cannie," said Fergus, "we were just-talking of Buck English. Mr. Purcel
      here-says that there's some mystery about him; for nobody knows how he
      lives, and every one almost is afraid of him. My Father, however, denies
      that every one is afraid of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Buck English!" exclaimed the pedlar. "Mr. O'Driscol, darlin', what did
      your honor say about him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I&mdash;I&mdash;a-hem&mdash;I wished to have the pleasure, Cannie,
      of&mdash;of&mdash;shaking hands, with the honest fellow; was not that it,
      Alick?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hands, or thumbs, or something that way," replied Alick; "threatening
      him, as it were."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shaking hands, upon honor, Alick&mdash;thumb to thumb, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Mr. O'Driscol, you're well known! to have more o' the divil than
      the man in you&mdash;beggin' your pardon, sir, for the freedoms, I'm
      takin'&mdash;but it's all for your own good I'm doin' it. Have you e're a
      mouse-hole about your place, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A-hem! Why, Cannie," asked O'Driscol, with an expression of strong alarm
      in his face&mdash;"why do you ask so&mdash;so&mdash;singular a question as
      that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bekaise, sir, sooner than you should breathe&mdash;mind, breathe's the
      word&mdash;one syllable against Buck English, I'd recommend you to go into
      the mouse-hole I spoke of, and never show your face out of it agin. I&mdash;an'
      everybody knows me, an' likes me, too, I hope&mdash;I meek&mdash;hem!
      throth I do make it a point never to name him at all, barrin' when I can't
      help it. Nobody knows anything about him, they say. By all accounts, he
      never sleeps a week, or at any rate more than a week, in the same place;
      an' whatever dress he has on comin' to any particular part of the
      counthry, he never changes; but they say that if you find him in any other
      part of the counthry, he has a different dress on him: he has a dress,
      they say, for every part."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has honored my father," said Alick, "by sending him a written proposal
      for my sister Julia&mdash;ha! ha! ha!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, now, did he, Mr. Alick?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; and he says that he may be refused now, but won't the next time he
      asks her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, Mr. Alick, I'll tell you what I'd advise you to do: go home,
      and tell your father to send for him, if he knows where to find him, and
      let him not lose a day in marryin' her to him; for if everything is thrue
      that's said of him, he was never known to break a promise, whether it was
      for good or ill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha! ha! ha! thank you, Cannie,&mdash;excellent!" replied Alick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who can he be, Cannie?" asked Miss O'Driscol, "this person of such
      wonderful mystery? I have never seen him, but I wish I could."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, have you, often&mdash;I'll engage, Miss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so do I," added her father; "I wish to see him also, and to have
      everything mysterious cleared up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," continued the pedlar, "I know nothing myself about him, only as I
      hear; but if all's thrue that's said, he could give your father, and you,
      Mr. Alick, lave to walk through the whole counthry in the hour of noonday
      or midnight, widout a finger ever bein' raised against one o' you; and as
      for you, Mr. O'Driscol, he could have the house pulled about your ears in
      an hour's time, if he wished&mdash;ay, and he would, too, if he heard that
      you spoke a harsh word of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As for me, Cannie," replied the magistrate, "I trust I'm a Christian man,
      and not in the habit of abusing the absent. Indeed, I don't see what right
      any one has to make impertinent inquiries into the life or way of living
      of any respectable person&mdash;I do not see it, Cannie; and, I assure
      you, I always set my face against such prying inquiries."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know, myself," continued the pedlar, "that there's a great many things
      said about him, an' people wishes to know who he is. Now I was tould a
      thing wanst by a sartain parson&mdash;I won't say who, but I believe it's
      not a thousand miles from the truth I'm spakin' about who he is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who is he?" asked Fergus; "out with it Cannie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then," he proceeded, in a cautious and confidential whisper, "it's
      said by them that ought to know, that he's an illaygal brother to the
      Great Counsellor. There now, you have it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it to Counsellor O'Connell?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, to Counsellor O'Connell&mdash;divil a one else. He's as like him as
      two pays, barrin' the color o' the hair. Sure the Counsellor puts every
      one down that crosses him, and so does Buck English. Miss Katherine,
      darlin,' won't you buy something? Here's the best of everything; don't be
      afeard of high prices. My maxim always is&mdash;to buy dear and sell
      chape, for the sake o' the fair sect. Come, gintlemen, Cannie Soogah's
      pack is a faist for the leedies&mdash;hem&mdash;I mane a feest for the
      ladies&mdash;hillo&mdash;ha! ha! ha! there's a touch of Buck English
      himself for you. Well, of coorse, what's a faist for the ladies must
      surely be a thrate to the gintlemen."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alick here availed himself of M'Carthy's experience, and presented Miss
      O'Driscol with a beautiful bracelet; O'Driscol and Fergus purchased some
      pocket-handkerchiefs and other matters, and our Jolly Pedlar went on his
      way rejoicing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fergus O'Driscol who was a shrewd and keen observer, could perceive,
      during the foregoing interview, that there was on the pedlar's countenance
      an expression of grave, hard, solemn irony, which it was difficult to
      notice, or having noticed it, to penetrate, or in any way analyse or
      understand. To him it was a complete enigma, the solution of which seized
      very strongly on his imagination, and set all his powers of reasoning and
      investigation to work. All admitted there was a mystery about Buck
      English; but Fergus felt a strong impression that there was one equally
      impenetrable about the pedlar himself. Having little else, however, than a
      passing thought, a fancy, on which to ground this surmise, he prudently
      concealed it, from an apprehension of being mistaken, and, consequently,
      of subjecting himself to ridicule.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fergus now brought Alick out to the garden, where they seemed to enjoy a
      very merry dialogue if several fits of hearty laughter may be said to
      constitute mirth; after this Alick went home; not, however, we should say
      until he first contrived to enjoy a short <i>tete-a-tete</i> with Miss
      O'Driscol.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the hour for the departure of the magistrate to test the resolution
      of the "men in buckram," who had resolved upon his assassination, had
      arrived, he most magnanimously got a double case of pistols, and in spite
      of all remonstrance from both son and daughter, he mounted his horse&mdash;Duke
      Schomberg&mdash;and in a most pompous and heroic spirit rode forth to
      quell the latent foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have already stated that O'Driscol's real character was thoroughly
      known by the country-folks around him, as the character of every such
      person usually is. Whilst he proceeds, then, upon his daring and heroic
      enterprise, we beg leave to state very briefly, that Fergus and Alick
      Purcel, having laid their heads together, procured, each, two of their
      father's laborers, whom they furnished material wherewith to blacken their
      faces; not omitting four large cabbage-stalks, with the heads attached,
      and kept under the right arm of each. These had been trimmed and blackened
      also, in order to have more the appearance of fire-arms. Thus armed, and
      with appropriate instructions, they planted themselves inside the hedges
      which inclosed the narrow turn of the road at Philpot's cornet, and
      awaited their "unsuspecting victim," as the phrase unhappily, and with too
      much truth, goes.
    </p>
    <p>
      O'Driscol, on approaching the fatal spot, regretted that there were no
      eyes upon this extraordinary manifestation of courage. He stretched up his
      neck and looked about him in all directions, with a hope that some one
      might observe the firmness and utter absence of all fear with which he
      came up to the place where the assassins were to lie in wait for him. He
      had now come within ten or twelve yards of it when, such was the force of
      his own cowardly imagination, that it had worked him up from a fictitious
      into a real terror; and on approaching the spot, he could not prevent
      himself from coughing pretty loudly, in order to ascertain that there
      really was no such thing as ah assassin behind the hedges. He coughed, we
      say, with a double case of pistols in his hand, when, heaven and earth!
      was the cough responded to&mdash;and in a jarring style&mdash;from behind
      the hedge to the right? He paused, pulled up his horse, and coughed again,
      when it also was responded to from that on the left; and at the same time
      four faces, dreadfully blackened, peeped, two on each side of him, and
      levelling their black and dreadful-looking blunderbusses&mdash;for they
      could be nothing else&mdash;were about to rid the world of a loyal
      magistrate, and deprive the Castle of its best friend and correspondent,
      when the latter gentleman, wheeling Duke Schomberg round, put him to most
      inglorious flight, and scampered off at the top of his speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jest was admirably managed; and nothing could exceed the unction with
      which he related his encounter with the villains. In fact, upon Falstaff's
      principle, he had discharged his pistols on the way home, as a proof of
      the desperate contest he had had with the blood-thirsty scoundrels. Like
      all his other exploits, however, it was added to the catalogue of his
      daring conflicts with the Whiteboys, and, ere the lapse of twenty-four
      hours, was in possession of "his friend the Castle."

    <h2>
      CHARTER XV.&mdash;Scene in a Parsonage&mdash;An Anti-Tithe Ringleader.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hitherto we have described the tithe-agitation as one which was externally
      general as well as deep-rooted; and so far we were perfectly correct. Our
      readers, however, are not to understand by this that there did not exist
      among the people&mdash;ay, and the priesthood too&mdash;a strong
      under-current of sympathy for the sufferings of the protestant clergy. The
      latter had indeed been now reduced to such privation as it is pitiable
      even to look back upon. One-half the glebe-houses presented such symptoms
      of cold nakedness and destitution, such a wrecked and gutted appearance,
      as could scarcely be conceived at present. Hundreds of their occupants had
      been obliged to part by degrees with all that was valuable or could be
      turned into money. The elegant and accomplished young female, hitherto
      accustomed to all the comforts and luxuries of life, was now to be taught
      a lesson of suffering and endurance as severe as it was unexpected. Many&mdash;many
      such lessons were taught, and we may add&mdash;well and nobly, and with
      true Christian fortitude, were they borne. We have already said that
      Purcel had the collection of tithe for four Parishes, and now that the
      distress among the clergy and their families had assumed such a dreadful
      and appalling aspect, he had an opportunity of ascertaining the
      extraordinary respect and affection for them which existed after all in
      the minds of the people. His own house and premises were now so strongly
      secured, and his apprehension of nocturnal attacks so strongly justified
      by the threats he had already received, and the disorganized state of the
      country around him, that he was forced to decline receiving the tithe at
      unseasonable hours; it being impossible for him to know whether the offer
      of payment might not have been a plan of the people to get into his
      dwelling, and wreak their vengeance upon him and his sons. Under these
      circumstances, his advice to them, communicated with due regard to his own
      safety, was to pay the money directly to the clergyman himself, or at
      least to some of his family; and this, indeed, when they lived near the
      clergyman, they always preferred doing. To be sure, the step was a
      hazardous one, but, as they say, where there is a will there is a way; and
      so it was in many instances on this occasion. The dead hour of the night
      was necessarily selected for the performance of this kind office, and in
      this way many an unexpected act of relief was experienced by the starving
      and destitute clergy, at the hands of the very persons who were sworn to
      abolish tithes, and to refuse paying them in any shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, to be sure, when Purcel or his sons happened to be abroad on
      business, attended as they now generally were by policemen for their
      protection, a countryman, for instance, would hastily approach him or
      them, as the case might be, and thrusting a sum of money rolled up in
      paper, into his hand, exclaim, "It's the thrifle o' the last gale o' rint,
      sir, that I was short in&mdash;you'll find a bit o' murnmyrandim in the
      paper, that'll show you it's all right." This, uttered with a dry,
      significant expression of countenance, was a sufficient indication of the
      object intended. On examining the paper, it was generally found to contain
      some such direction as the following&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "MR. PURCEL, SIR&mdash;The enclosed is for the Rev. Misther Harvey. For
      God's sake, give it to him as soon as you can; as I undherstand himself
      and family is starvin' outright&mdash;I daren't give it to him myself, or
      be seen goin' near his house. Sure when we think of the good he done,
      himself an' his family, whin they had the manes, it's enough to make one
      pity them, especially when we know what they're sufferin' so quietly, an'
      without makin' any hubbub about it; but sure, God help us, there's humbug
      enough in the counthry. Don't lose time, i' you plase, Mr. Purcel, as I'm
      tould that they're brought to the dry praitie at last, God help them."

      It was in the early part of the day of O'Driscol's last triumph on Duke
      Schomberg, that John Purcel went to discharge to a clergyman in the next
      parish, a commission of a similar nature to that just recited. He drove
      there on a car, accompanied by three policemen, avoiding, as well as he
      could, all narrow and dangerous passes, and determined to return, if at
      all practicable, by a different road, for such of late was the practice of
      the family, when out on business. An it is, however, we shall leave him on
      his way and take the liberty of requesting our readers to anticipate his
      arrival, for the purpose of getting a glimpse at the condition of those to
      whom he was carrying some slight means of mere temporary relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clergyman, whose desolate habitation he was about to visit, had passed
      about sixty winters, fifteen of which he had spent in that house, and
      thirty in the parish. That is to say, he had been fifteen years curate,
      and fifteen rector, without ever having been absent more than a month or
      six weeks at a time; and even these absences occurred but rarely. We
      remember him well, and with affection, as who of his survivors that ever
      knew him does not? He was tall, that is, somewhat above the middle height,
      and until pressed down by the general affliction which fell upon his class
      and his family, he had been quite erect in his person. He was now bent,
      however, as by a load of years, and on his pale face lay the obvious
      traces of sorrow and suffering. But this was not all; whilst Destitution
      of the severest kind had impressed on that venerable countenance the
      melancholy exponent of her presence, Religion had also blended with it
      that beautiful manifestation of her unshaken trust in God; of patience,
      meekness, and a disposition to receive at his hands the severest
      dispensations of life, with a spirit of cheerful humility and resignation.
      Take a cursory glance at his face, and there, no doubt, you saw at once
      that sorrow and suffering lay. Look, however, a little longer; observe the
      benign serenity of that clear and cloudless eye; mark the patient
      sweetness of that firm and well-formed mouth, and the character of heroic
      tranquility that pervades his whole person, and sanctifies his sorrows,
      until they fill the heart of the spectator with reverence and sympathy,
      and his mind with a sense of the dignity, not to say sublimity, which
      religion can bestow upon human suffering, in which it may almost be said
      that the creature gains a loving triumph over the Creator himself.

      Every one knows that, in general, the clergy of Ireland, as a class, lived
      from hand to mouth, and that the men who suffered most during the period
      of which we write were those whose livings were of moderate income. The
      favored individuals, who enjoyed the rich and larger incumbencies, the
      calamity did not reach, or if it did, only in a slighter degree, and with
      but comparatively little effect. The cessation, therefore, of only one
      year's income to those who had no other source of support on which to
      depend, was dreadful. In many instances, however, their tithes had been
      refused for two, and, in some localities, for nearly three years, although
      the opposition to the payment had not for such a length of time assumed
      the fierce and implacable spirit which had characterized it during the
      last twelve months. These observations will now enable our readers to
      understand more clearly the picture with which we are about to present
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      On entering the house of this truly pious and patient pastor, the first
      thing that struck you was the sense of vacancy and desolation united. In
      other words, you perceived at a glance that everything of any value was
      gone. You saw scarcely any furniture&mdash;no clock, no piano, no
      carpeting, no mahogany chairs or tables, or at least none that were not of
      absolute necessity. Feather beds had gone, curtains had gone; and all
      those several smaller elegancies which it is difficult, and would be
      tedious, to enumerate here. Seated at a breakfast-table, in an uncarpeted
      parlor, was the clergyman himself, surrounded by his interesting but
      afflicted family. His hair, which, until within the last twelve months,
      had been an iron gray, was now nearly white, and his chin was sunk in a
      manner that had not, until recently, been usual with him. Servants, male
      and female, had been dismissed, and those whose soft, fair hands had been
      accustomed only to the piano, the drawing-pencil, or the embroidery-frame,
      were now engaged in the coarsest and commonest occupations of domestic
      life. Nor were they, too, without their honorable sacrifices of personal
      vanity and social pride, to the calamity that was upon them. Silks and
      satins, laces and gauzes, trinkets, unnecessary bonnets and veils, were
      all cheerfully parted with; and it was on such occasions that our friend
      the <i>Cannie Soogah</i> became absolutely a kind of public benefactor. He
      acted not only in the character of a pedlar, but in that of a broker; and
      so generally known were his discretion and integrity throughout the
      country, that such matters were disposed of to him at a far less amount of
      shame and suffering than they could have been in any other way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family in question consisted of the father, his wife, four daughters,
      and three sons; the eldest daughter had been, for some months, discharging
      the duty of governess in a family of rank; the eldest son had just got an
      appointment as usher in a school near the metropolis; two circumstances
      which filled the hearts of this affectionate family with a satisfaction
      that was proportionately heightened by their sufferings.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this period they expected a letter from their daughter; and on the
      morning in question their father had dispatched one of his boys to the
      post-office, with a hope of receiving it. The male portion of the family
      were the younger, with the exception of the eldest son, who was their
      third child. Their position was as follows: the old man sat at the end of
      a plain table, with his bible open before him&mdash;for they had just
      concluded prayer: his wife, a younger-looking woman, and faded more by
      affliction than by age, sat beside him, holding on her breast their third
      daughter&mdash;she who had been once the star of their hearth, and who
      reclined there in mute sorrow, her pale cheek and wasted hands giving
      those fatal indications of consumption in its last stage, which so
      severely tries the heart of parent or relative to witness. The other two
      girls sat opposite, one of them in tears, turning her heart-broken look
      now upon the countenance of her father and again upon that of her gentle,
      but almost dying sister, whilst her companion endeavored to soothe her
      little brother, who was crying for food; for the simple fact was, that
      they had not yet breakfasted, nor were the means of providing a breakfast
      under their roof. Their sole hope for that, as well as for more enlarged
      relief, depended upon the letter which they expected from their eldest
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is scarcely necessary to say that they all looked pale, sickly, and
      emaciated with suffering, and want of' the comfortable necessaries of
      life. Their dress was decent, of course, but such as they never expected
      to have been forced to wear so long. The crying boy was barefooted, and
      the young creature who endeavored to console him had thin and worn
      slippers on her tender feet, and her snowy skin was in more than one place
      visible through the rents of her frock. The old man looked at them, from
      time to time; and there might have been observed, notwithstanding the
      sweetness and placidity of his smile, a secret expression of inward agony&mdash;the
      physical and natural feelings of the parent and the man mingling, or
      rather struggling, with the great principle of dependence on God, without
      which he must at once have sunk down prostrate and hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When," said the boy, "will Edward come from the post-office? Is there
      nothing at all in the house, mamma, that I could eat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush! Frank," said his sister; "where's your generosity and your
      patience? Did we not all promise to think of papa and mamma before
      ourselves&mdash;yes, and of our poor Maria, too, who is so ill?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is true," replied the boy, "but when I promised that, I wasn't so
      hungry as I am now. But, still, if I had anything to eat, I would give the
      best part of it to papa or mamma, or Maria, if she could eat it&mdash;that
      is, after I had taken one mouthful for myself. Oh will Ned never come from
      the post-office?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mamma," said the sick girl, looking up into her mother's eyes, "I am
      sustained by one hope, and that is, that I will soon cease to be a burthen
      upon dear papa&mdash;my heartbroken papa and you. I am anxious to pass
      away to that blessed place where all tears shall be wiped from my eyes;"
      and as she spoke she raised herself a little, and quietly wiped one or two
      from them; and, she proceeded, "where the weary will be at rest. Alas! how
      little did we expect or imagine this great weight of suffering!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My darling child," said her mother, kissing her pale cheek, and pressing
      her more tenderly to her bosom, "you have ever been more solicitous for
      the comfort and well-being of others than you have been for your own; yet,
      well and dearly as we love you, how can we grudge you to God? It was He
      who gave you to us&mdash;it is He who is taking you from us; and what can
      we say, but blessed be His name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My children," said the old man, "what would life be if there were nothing
      to awaken us to a sense of our responsibilities to our Creator? If it
      presented to us nothing but one unshaken path of pleasure and ease&mdash;one
      equal round of careless enjoyment and indolent apathy? Alas! my darlings,
      do not we, who are aged and have experience, know that it is those who are
      not taken by calamity and suffering who gradually fall into that hardness
      of heart, which prevents the spirit from feeling one of the most wholesome
      of truths&mdash;that indifference is danger, and that a neglect of the
      things which belong to a better life, and which serve to prepare us for
      it, is the great omission of those who are not called upon to suffer. You
      know, my children, that whom God loveth He chasteneth, and it is true. To
      those whom He graciously visits with affliction, it may be said that He
      communicates, from time to time, a new revelation of Himself; for it is by
      such severe but wholesome manifestations that He speaks to and arouses the
      forgetful or the alienated heart. Our calamity, however, and sufferings,
      possess more dignity, and are associated with a greater work than that
      involved in the isolated sorrows of a single family. God is chastising a
      cold, corrupt, and negligent church, through the turbulence and outrage of
      the people. What has our church in this country been, within the memory of
      man, but a mere secular establishment, like the law or the army, into
      which men enter not from a lofty and pure sense of the greatness of their
      mission, but as a convenient means of securing an easy and indolent
      profession? I know not what our church might have been if left to herself;
      but this I do know, that for many a long year the unblushing iniquity of
      British policy has served only to corrupt and degrade her, and to make
      what ought to be the speaking oracle of God's truth, the consolation of
      the penitent sinner, the sure guide to the ignorant or the doubtful&mdash;yes,
      to make that Church, which ought to be a source of purity, of blessing,
      and of edification, to all&mdash;a system of corrupt rewards for political
      prostitution, parcelled out to meet the sordid spirit of family alliances
      and ungodly bargains; or, in other words, to turn her into a mass of
      bribes&mdash;a base appendage to the authority of the British minister,
      who used her as the successful medium of at once enslaving and
      demoralizing the country, instead of elevating and civilizing it. It is
      for this great neglect of national duty, and for permitting ourselves to
      be imbued with the carnal and secular spirit, which has led us so far from
      practical truth and piety, that the church is now suffering. We have
      betrayed our trust, and been treacherous both to God and man. For my own
      part, my children, I am glad that I and mine have been counted worthy to
      suffer in this cause. We are now passing through the furnace, but we shall
      come out purified. Our grossness shall be purged away, and the proud
      spirit of mammon burned out of us. But you know that God, my dear ones,
      can accomplish a double purpose by the same means. Our church shalt be
      exalted and purified, and her ministers prepared for a higher and holier
      mission than that in which they have hitherto been engaged. She shall
      awaken to a sense of her great responsibility; a new spirit shall be
      created within her; a living energy shall characterize those who have
      slumbered under the unholy shadows which she has cast around her, and
      those who think that they are smiting her unto death shall find that they
      have been made only the instruments in God's hands for the purification of
      her body and the regeneration of her spirit. Charles," he added, turning
      to the boy, who still wept, although as furtively as he could, "bear up,
      my child: Ned, you may rest assured, will make as little delay as
      possible, and I hope he will bring us relief."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mamma," said the invalid, looking up tenderly into her face, "will you&mdash;oh!
      no, not you, mamma&mdash;Emily will&mdash;a mouthful of drink, Emily dear,
      and let it be pure water, Emily; I think it agrees with me best."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, my darling!" exclaimed her mother, wiping away a few quiet tears,
      "I have nothing else to give you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, mamma, but you know I like it very much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precious child," replied her mother, again tenderly pressing her to her
      bosom; "we all know your goodness, and the reluctance with which you ask
      anything that you fear might occasion us trouble. Dearest life, it will be
      the memory of these glimpses of angelic goodness that will wring our
      hearts when you are&mdash;&mdash;" She paused, for the words had been
      uttered unconsciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said her father, "they will console us, my child, and make your
      memory smell sweet, and blossom from the very dust. You have probably
      heard of the beautiful sentiment so exquisitely delineated by the great
      painter&mdash;'I too have been in Arcadia,'&mdash;and will it not be
      something to us to be able to say,&mdash;'We too have an angel in
      paradise!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sister brought her a cup of cold water, with which, after thanking her
      with a sweet smile, she merely wet her lips. "Alas! I am very troublesome
      to you all, but I shall not long&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Darling sister," said Emily, tenderly kissing her, "do not speak so; you
      are too good, and ever were so. Ah! Maria," she exclaimed, gushing into
      tears, "is it come to this at last!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The sick girl placed her hand affectionately upon her cheek, and said&mdash;"Dear,
      dear sister, how I love you! Oh! how I love you all! and papa, my dear
      papa, how I pity you in your sorrow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, my darling, I know that your heart is pervaded and sustained by
      all tenderness and affection; and indeed it is a consolation that since
      calamity has come upon us, it has fallen upon a family of love&mdash;of
      love to which it only gives greater strength and tenderness. This is a
      great blessing, my children, and we ought to feel deeply thankful for it.
      But, at the same time, it matters not what we suffer, we must allow
      nothing in this world of trial to shake our trust in God. Here, however,
      is our poor little messenger. Well Edward, any letter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, papa; there is one from Matilda. I know her writing."
    </p>
    <p>
      He then handed the letter to his father, and immediately going over to his
      sick sister, he placed a slice of bread and butter in her hand, adding,
      "The head-constable of police gave it to me; I would have refused it
      though&mdash;but for Maria."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you eat none of it yourself, Edward?" asked Maria.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he replied, "I thought mamma might make you up some light nice thing
      out of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I cannot eat it, my dear Ned; divide it as you wish, but thank you,
      darling, from my heart, for thinking of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      He then would have shared it as equally as he could among them, but to
      himself and his brother it was left; the others, from a feeling which may
      easily be understood, declined to partake of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not, of course, give this as a general picture of the distress which
      was felt; but we do give it as a picture which was by no means rare among
      the established clergy at the period of which we write. We know, from the
      best authority, that the privations of the time were frequently so severe
      as to find many families without food to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their daughter's letter was touching and simple, but unfortunately it
      contained, not the remittance they expected; a circumstance which, in
      their condition, was such a disappointment as cannot well be described.
      She stated that, in consequence of the absence from home, for some days,
      of the family with whom she lived, it was out of her power to send them
      the full amount of her first quarter's salary as she had intended, or any
      money at all, as they knew she had none except her salary to send. She
      wrote, however, lest they might think or suppose for a moment that she had
      forgotten them. She sent her warmest love and affection to them all,
      especially to Maria, whom she hoped her letter would find better. Here she
      mentioned them all by name, and concluded by saying, that the moment the
      family returned home, she would remit to her dear papa the amount of her
      whole quarter's salary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youngsters all burst into tears, the fact being that they had not
      tasted food for more than eighteen hours. The mother, worn and pale with
      anxiety and distress, turned sorrowfully to her husband and said:
      "Charles, what is to be done? must our children die? must they perish with
      famine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Send Charles over to M'Mahon's," replied her husband; "he is poor, it is
      true, but he is our next neighbor, and from him, if he will oblige us,
      relief will come soonest. Charles, go, my child, and ask Con M'Mahon if he
      will be good enough to send me a stone or two of potatoes for a few days;
      and I will feel obliged&mdash;your brother, poor child, is fatigued by his
      journey to the post-office, and from other causes&mdash;or being the elder
      I would make him go&mdash;if M'Mahon obliges me, tell him that I will
      thank him to send them, as I have no messenger to fetch them. I have
      always found poor M'Mahon respectful and neighborly, and I am certain he
      will not refuse us."
    </p>
    <p>
      We shall not detail the distressing and melancholy conversation, in which
      they were engaged until the child's return. It is enough to say that,
      although he met with no refusal, the expected relief was not sent. "Well,
      my child," inquired his anxious father, "what reply did he give?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He said, papa," returned the child, "that he would give you a whole sack
      of potatoes with pleasure, but that, to send them in the open day, would
      be more than his life is worth&mdash;he dare not do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man looked up, then clasping his hands together, and glancing at
      his unhappy family, a few bitter tears rolled down his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," added the boy, "he said he would bring over as many as he could
      carry, about twelve o'clock to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," continued his father, "that is civil; and I believe, as to the
      danger, he is right. But, in the meantime, what is to be done? I fear all
      the available sources of relief have been already exhausted, with the
      exception of heaven alone&mdash;in which, my children, we must not permit
      anything to shake our trust. I am feeble, but yet I must go forth and try
      to secure some food for you, my poor famishing family: hold up, then, my
      dear children, even for a little, for certain I am that God will provide
      for us still."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was, accordingly, upon the point of going out, when John Purcel
      entered; and as the object of his visit is already known to the reader, we
      shall leave to his imagination the sense of the relief which it afforded.
    </p>
    <p>
      This now is not an overdrawn picture of particular cases&mdash;and they
      were numerous&mdash;which occurred during the period of what was termed
      the Tithe rebellion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The circumstance of the message to M'Mahon's, however, was the cause of a
      scene which we could not possiby omit, in a work treating of this peculiar
      and most distressing crisis. As the boy Charles was on his way to
      M'Mahon's&mdash;and this he mentioned to the family afterwards&mdash;he
      was met, he said, by a gentleman dressed in rusty black, mounted upon a
      strong, coarse horse; and who, after looking at him with a good deal of
      surprise, said&mdash;"What is your name, my fine fellow?" and on hearing
      it he asked him where he was going. The child, who had been trained to
      nothing but truth; mentioned at once the object of his message; upon which
      the gentleman in question, after having heard it, thrust his hands into
      his smallclothes pocket, and then drew them out with an air of impatience,
      exclaiming&mdash;"Bad luck to it for poverty&mdash;it's the curse o' the
      counthry." Now this worthy priest, for such he was, had not been many
      weeks in the parish at the period of his meeting with the little boy; and
      it so happened, that his residence was within about a quarter of a mile of
      the glebe house. He was, besides, one of the few who had given, upon more
      than one occasion, rather unequivocal manifestations of violent opposition
      to the whole system of tithes. As a matter of course, he was the last
      individual from whom anything like sympathy for those who suffered in such
      a cause might be expected. Much of the same character was M'Mahon, to whom
      the distressed parson had applied for the humble loan of food. He
      assailed, in fact, the whole Establishment, and took both an active and
      conspicuous part in the excitement which then agitated the country. He
      joined the crowds, vociferated and shouted among them at the top of his
      lungs, and took the liberty of laying down the law on the subject, as he
      termed it: that is to say, of swearing that one stick or stone of their
      dirty Establishment should not be left upon another, but that the whole
      bobbery of it must be sent to blazes&mdash;where it would all go yet,
      plaise God. Of course his neighbor, the parson, was by no means cognizant
      of this violence on the part of M'Mahon, or he would never have thought of
      applying to him, even under the severest pressure of absolute destitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having premised thus much concerning these two individuals, we request our
      readers to accompany us to the house of the Rev. Anthony Casey, and to
      suppose that it is a little after the hour of eleven o'clock at night. The
      worthy gentleman and his curate had just seated themselves in his snug,
      but humble little parlor, where a pleasant turf fire was beginning to get
      somewhat dim, when the following dialogue occurred between them:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pettier," said Father Anthony to his curate, who had just returned from a
      sick call, "you found the night bitther, I think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is very cold, indeed, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have had a long ride of it upon that mountain road, without even a
      bush to shelther you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not less than fourteen miles I think," replied the curate, "and a
      cold, desolate road as I ever travelled."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have read your office?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have discharged your duty to that poor, sick widow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope so, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you have ridden under a severe night, along a naked road, a distance
      of fourteen miles?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you feel your mind aisy, and your conscience at rest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can say so with truth, thank God," replied the curate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, in that case," proceeded the kind-hearted priest, "I think
      you had better take a tumbler of punch: it will comfort you, and make you
      sleep like a top."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir," replied the curate, "I am much obliged to you; but I
      don't require it, I have no particular wish for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I tell you, man alive, that it will do you good; and lest you might
      feel solitary, I think I will take one with you, merely to keep you in
      countenance;&mdash;here Katty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Katty, a complacent, kind-looking woman, somewhat past the middle period
      of life, then made her appearance. "Well, your reverence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get hot water and tumblers&mdash;Father Pettier is starved after his long
      ride such a night, and must have a tumbler of punch to warm him, poor
      fellow, and I am going to keep him in countenance; and see, Katty, bring
      the poteen that's in Ould Broadbottom, at the right-hand side o' the
      cubbard. Stir the fire a little, Pettier, and throw on a sod or two&mdash;it's
      getting dull."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was complied with; and Father Peter observed, after he had trimmed
      the grate a little:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "The country, sir, is in a frightful state. This tithe rebellion is quite
      general. On my way out to Drumfurrar and home again, I met large crowds on
      the roads, cold as the night is; and on speaking to, and remonstrating
      with them, upon meeting and being abroad at such hours, they desired me to
      mind my own business, and allow them to mind theirs. The country is
      literally alive with them night and day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," replied Father Anthony, "let them work out their own
      purposes, provided they keep within the limits of the law. You know the
      Established Church is nothing else than an English garrison to support and
      keep alive British interests in this country; but the people are going the
      right way to work; for I tell you, Pettier, that, by strictly observing
      the doctrine of passive resistance, they will starve the same garrison
      clane and clear out o' the country. And won't that be a great day for
      Ireland, Pettier?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir, no doubt of it; but in the meantime the unfortunate parsons are
      suffering dreadfully: many of them are starving literally, and it is those
      who have not hoarded up the mammon of unrighteousness, but have been
      charitable and benevolent to the poor, who are now suffering most."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, faith, that's not a bad thought, Pettier; but I tell you the mammon
      of unrighteousness is by no means a bad thing. We may say as we will, we
      priests and parsons, but I say to you, what is a man worth in this world
      without money? Not a thraneen. A complete nonenity, and sorras thing else.
      And whisper, Pettier; what is the starving of the parsons to us? They had
      the fat an' marrow of the land long, enough, and I think it's full time
      that we should come in for a lick at last. Think of you or I living to see
      ourselves rolling about in a rich carriage, with a lump of a mithre, like
      a pair of ass's ears stuck together, painted on the outride of it, and we
      waiting, and drinkn' of the best. Arra, salvation to me, but the
      prospect's a born beauty, so it is, and will be rayalized yet, plaise
      God."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too much wealth, sir, is an enemy to religion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Pettier, that may be so occasionally; but here's your health, and
      in the meantime, I didn't care that some of us had a little more of it. I
      would have given a pound-note today to have had five shillings about me;
      and sorra testher I had in my company."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must have been pretty closely pressed for cash, when you would have
      given such a premium."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Troth, then, I was; and when the poor boy mentioned whose son he was, and
      when I saw his little delicate feet without shoes, and heard his story&mdash;mammon
      of unrighteousness! devil a thing in life aiquil to it. It enables a man
      to do the practical good, and not satisfy himself or escape with empty
      words."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They say our neighbor here, Mr. Goodison, is very ill off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I dare say he's not on the top of the wheel; however, as I said,
      what's their starvation to us? If it was laid upon them for their sins, do
      you think it would be right in us to intherfare and set ourselves against
      Providence?&mdash;blessed be His name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I must confess," replied his amiable curate, "that I was not
      prepared for such an argument as that from you. You know we ought to love
      our enemies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," replied Father Anthony; "I have no objection to love our
      enemies, provided they feed themselves. But surely to love and feed them
      is rather too much of a good thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      During this brief dialogue they had mixed each his tumbler of punch, and
      after a pause of some minutes, during which the hardhearted parish priest
      sighed deeply as he looked into the fire, he exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know, Pettier, that I am opposed to a Protestant Established Church
      in this country; and you know, besides, that I have gone farther in this
      tithe affair than most of my brethren, and on that account I hope you are
      not surprised at my opinions. Starve them out's my maxim. But still,
      aftcher all, salvation to me, but it's a trying case to be without food,
      and above all, to see your own children&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My own children," exclaimed the curate, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, Pether," proceeded this benevolent hypocrite, forgetting everything
      but the image that was before him&mdash;"Ay, in troth, your own children&mdash;your
      own children, poor things, without a morsel to put into their mouths; and
      your wife, Pether, that you love betther than&mdash;than&mdash;aye, than a
      station dinner, a thousand times&mdash;sittin' with a pale face and a
      breaking, or, maybe, a broken heart, looking on at their privations and
      their miserable destitution, without being able to render them the laist
      assistance. Bad luck to it, for a mammon of unrighteousness, it's never in
      the way when it's wanted."
    </p>
    <p>
      After he had concluded, he took out a red cotton pocket-handkerchief,
      spotted at equal distances with white dice, and wiped away the tears that
      had gushed to his eyes whilst he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pettier," said he, immediately, "finish your tumbler and go to bed; you
      know we must be off to-morrow to station before six o'clock, and after
      your bitther ride to-night you want rest, poor fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      When about a quarter of an hour had elapsed, and he had seen Peter to bed,
      he went to the kitchen, and asked Katty, his housekeeper, who always
      attended upon him and his curate, if she had done what he desired her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's done, your reverence," she replied, "but you'll never be able to
      carry it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's not your affair, Katty&mdash;do you hear now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do, your reverence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, then, I tell you that's none of your affair,&mdash;the sorra
      bit. I hope you did'nt let Barney go to bed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of coorse not, sir, when you bid me keep him up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, then; and if either he or you brittle a syllable of this to
      Father Pether, I'll read you both oat&mdash;do you hear that now? Bring
      Barney here, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      Barney accordingly made his appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now mark me," continued the priest, "if either of you ever brathes a
      syllable of this, salvation to me, but I'll read you both out from the
      althar. Here now help me on with this sack; it's for a distressed person
      in the neighborhood that wants it badly, as you may judge, or I wouldn't
      be trudging off with it at this hour of the night. Katty, you go to bed,
      and let Barney stay up till I come back&mdash;did you mind my words, I
      repate&mdash;read you both out, if ever a syllable comes to Father
      Pother's ears, or anybody's else's but our own."
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant man accordingly assisted him to raise upon his stout and
      honest shoulders a short heavy bag of oatmeal, into which he had thrust a
      large flitch of newly-hung bacon; and thus loaded, the violent anti-tithe
      priest bent his way, nearly at the hour of twelve o'clock, to the
      residence of the Rev. Mr. Goodison, his neighbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is necessary to state here, that the glebe-house of that gentleman was
      situated within about two hundred yards of two crossroads, one of which
      went by the gate of entrance to it. After a severe trudge, during a night
      that began now to brighten as the moon rose, Father Anthony found himself
      approaching the cross-roads in question, and for a moment imagined that he
      saw his own shadow before him, an impression which soon changed on
      observing that the shadow, or whatever it was, although loaded much as he
      himself was, that is to say, with a sack on his shoulders, evidently
      approached him&mdash;a circumstance which he knew to be an impossibility,
      and that it must, consequently, be a distinct individual. Having satisfied
      himself of this, he got under the shade of a hedge, a movement in which he
      was instantly imitated by the stranger. Each stood concealed for some
      time, with a, hope that the other might advance and turn probably out of
      his way; but neither seemed disposed to move. At length, Father Anthony
      gave a kind of inquisitive, dry cough, by way of experiment, which was
      instantly responded to by another cough equally dry and mysterious. These
      were repeated two or three times without success, when at last Father
      Anthony advanced a little under shadow of the hedge, and found as before
      that the strange individual did the same; and thus, in fact, they kept
      gradually, coughing at each other and approaching until they fairly met
      face to face, each with a sack upon his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Con M'Mahon!" exclaimed the priest, "why, what on earth brought you out
      at this hour of the night, and&mdash;aisy, what is this you're' carrying?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faix, your reverence," replied the other, "I might as well ask yourself
      the same two questions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know you might," said Father Anthony; "but in the manetime you had
      better not."
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest spoke like one whose wind had not been improved by the burthen
      he carried; and M'Mahon, anxious if possible to get rid of him, determined
      to enter into some conversation that might tire out his strength. He
      consequently selected the topic of the day as being best calculated for
      that purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't these blessed times that's coming, plaise your reverence," said
      M'Mahon, "when we'll be done wid these tithes, and have the millstone
      taken from our necks altogether?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This was spoken in a most wheedling and insinuating tone replete with the
      the confidence of one who knew that the stronger he spoke the more
      satisfaction he would give his auditor, and the more readily he would
      avert any suspicion as to his object and appearance at such an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," returned the priest, giving his burthen an uneasy twitch, "we have
      had too weighty a load upon our shoulders this many a day, and the devil's
      own predicament it is to be overburthened with anything&mdash;we all know
      that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorra doubt of it," replied the other, easing himself as well as he could
      by a corresponding hitch; "but it's one comfort to myself anyhow, that I
      done my duty against the same tithes&mdash;an' bad luck to them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you did your duty, you weren't without a good example, at all events,"
      replied the priest; "I taught you how to hate the accursed impost&mdash;but
      at the same time, you know I always told you to make a distinction between
      the tithes and the&mdash;hem&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' what, your reverence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hem&mdash;why you know, Con, that we're commanded to love our enemies,
      and it was upon this ground that I always taught you to make a
      distinction, as I say, between the tithes and the parsons themselves. And
      by the way, now, I don't know but it would be our duty," he proceeded, "to
      render the same parsons, now that they're suffering, as much good for evil
      as possible. It would be punishing the thieves by heaping, as the
      Scripture says, coals of fire upon their heads."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you think, your reverence," replied the other, who was too quick
      of apprehension not to suspect what the priest was driving at, "do you
      think that I have been so long listening to your advice, not to know that
      such a coorse was my duty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the way," continued the priest, "to punish them like a Christian."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, to punish them, your reverence, as you say&mdash;an' in troth, I'm
      the man myself that 'ud go any length to do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But where are you bound to now, Con, and what&mdash;ahem&mdash;what is
      that you are carrying?" asked the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why then, it's the butt-end of a sack o' pittities," replied Con, giving
      an answer only to the easiest side of the query.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, but who are you bringing them?" he asked again, "because, thank
      God, there's not much poverty in this neighborhood at present."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, God forgive me!" replied the other, concealing his
      benevolence by a grin, which he could not prevent at his own ingenuity,
      but which he endeavored to conceal as well as he could; "God forgive me!
      but hearin' that Goodison the parson here, and his family were in great
      distress, I thought I might as well have my revenge aginst him, by
      fetchin' him a load o' praties, which is all I can spare the poor ould&mdash;hem&mdash;the
      heretical ould creature&mdash;and so, says I to myself, it's a good
      opportunity of heapin' the coals upon him that you spoke about, sir. And
      upon my conscience, as far as a good weighty butt o' praties goes, I'll
      punish him this very night."
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest gave a short hiccup or two, as if laboring under some momentary
      affection of the throat, which soon extended to the eyes, for with some
      difficulty he put up his naked hand and wiped away a kind of moisture,
      that in ordinary cases would have very much resembled tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I see, Con!" he said, after clearing his throat a little, "you had a
      grudge against him like myself, and you determined to&mdash;ay&mdash;just
      so&mdash;you see, Con, here's the way of it; he didn't visit me yet since
      I came to the parish&mdash;do you understand?&mdash;and I tell you, flesh
      or blood couldn't overlook such a slight; so I'm glad, at all events, that
      you had the spirit to follow my advice&mdash;for the truth is, I'm goin'
      to have my revenge as well as yourself; but when one does take his
      revenge, Con, it's always best to take it like a Christian. So now that we
      understand, one another, let us go up to the glebe&mdash;otherwise I'll
      drop.&mdash;However, salvation to me!" he exclaimed with a smile, "if
      we'll bear their burthens much longer! I have a butt of meal here, I saw
      his son to-day, too, without a stitch to his foot, poor boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so did I," replied M'Mahon; "he sent one o' them over to me for the
      loan of a lock o' praties."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, God help them!" exclaimed the priest. "Come, Con, let us hurry&mdash;but
      why didn't you send them then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, sir&mdash;why, bekaise I daren't send them in open daylight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True enough," said the other; "and it was stupid of me to ask. I myself
      would have sent what I'm carrying to him by Barney Brennan, but that I
      feared it would take wind, in which case the people might withdraw their
      confidence from me, from an apprehension that I wanted to curry favor with
      the parson of the parish, which I assure you, Condy, I do not. But listen
      to me, now; you're never to brathe a syllable of this adventure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ill give you my oath of it, sir, if you wish, takin' it for granted, at
      the same time, that I'm safe with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never fear that; I'm not the man to play the traitor on any poor fellow
      that I might catch at any illegal work of the kind."
    </p>
    <p>
      Both were now within a few perches of the hall-door, when the priest, who
      was scarcely able to speak from fatigue, said with some difficulty:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Con, as we have met, I think you must take the responsibility of this
      night's adventure on yourself. Here, now," said he, depositing his burden
      against the door as he spoke, "I think the best thing to do, in order to
      spare their feelings&mdash;for I need not tell you, that they are, by all
      accounts, a delicately-minded and highly-educated family&mdash;and it will
      be well to tax them as little as possible; I say then,&mdash;let us place,
      these sacks against the hall-door, and as soon as it is opened, they will
      tumble in heels foremost upon them, and then you can cut. So now I leave
      you to manage it, only, on any earthly account, don't name me to a living
      soul in the business. Good night, now, and God bless you&mdash;as He
      will," he added, retreating from the hall-door&mdash;"as He will, you
      kind-hearted, good-natured ringleader you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The matter, however, did not end here, for, as Burns says, "the best-laid
      schemes of mice and men may gang agree." The aid received by the venerable
      Mr. Goodigon and his family had escaped through the children, in the early
      part of the next day, and had spread through the neighborhood; and sooth
      to say, there was scarcely a voice among them louder in condemnation of
      the fact than that of Con M'Mahon, who said it was a bad way to banish
      tithes by assistin' the parsons. So far as he was concerned, however, the
      secret did not at all transpire. His reverence, however, was by no means
      so fortunate. The next morning, he and his curate were under the necessity
      of holding a station in a distant part of the parish. Father Anthony,
      however, feeling himself fatigued by his burthen of the preceding night,
      sent the curate on before him, with an assurance that he would follow him
      in an hour or two. He accordingly did so, but, with his usual inattention
      to dress, was seen the next morning, about ten o'clock, riding along the
      public road&mdash;which was a great thoroughfare&mdash;towards the
      locality of the station with the history of the previous night's
      transaction written as clearly oh his back as if it had been labelled
      there in large and legible print. The truth is, the humane and charitable
      priest had neglected to get his coat brushed&mdash;an operation which it
      never underwent unless on a Sunday morning&mdash;and the consequence was,
      that whilst the front part of his dress was tolerably black, the back part
      of it would have done credit to the coat of a miller. The sagacity of the
      people was not for a moment at fault. Both circumstances were immediately
      connected; his reverence's secret took wind, and before the expiration of
      forty-eight hours was known to the whole parish.

      &mdash;Mogue Moglan's Anxiety for the Safety of the Purcels&mdash;Tithe
      Distraint&mdash;Good News for Mr. Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matters had now arrived at such a crisis, that either the law must be
      vindicated, or tithes should be considered as put down by violence on the
      one hand, and passive resistance on the other; for, as the question stood,
      it had to grapple with both. The clergymen of the establishment, cramped
      by poverty, and harassed by delay, were not now in a condition to recover
      their incomes by the tedious and expensive processes that were hitherto
      resorted to. Some point, however, was made, or some antiquated statute was
      ferreted out, owing to the black-letter craft of certain astute lawyers,
      by which the parson or proctor, we believe, as the case might have been,
      instead of being forced to incur enormous expense for the recovery of any
      individual responsibility, was enabled, through what was termed a "Writ of
      Rebellion," to join the greater part of a parish, if not the whole of it,
      in the same legal process, by inserting their names in the writ. At first,
      however, and in the early stage of the proceedings, the resistance was by
      no means passive. Experience, however, soon taught the people that the law
      and the executive, when opposed, were anything but playthings, and the
      loss of several lives on the part of those who attempted, by force, to
      obstruct the execution of the former, led to the expediency of adopting
      the passive plan. A widow's son had been shot in a tithe-levy; and on the
      other side, a clergyman named Ryder had fallen a victim to the outrage of
      the people&mdash;as, we believe, had other reverend gentlemen also,
      together with a tithe-proctor, who was shot in his own field in open day,
      his son, a boy of fifteen or sixteen, having also a narrow escape.
      Purcel's position was now one of extreme danger and difficulty. The
      combination against tithes had been carried to such a height, that not
      only were the people sworn to pay no tithes, but all the proctor's
      laborers were forced, besides, to quit his employment. No man could work
      for him, unless at the certain risk of his life. By the mere influence of
      money, and the offer of triple wages, he succeeded in procuring a number
      of workmen from a neighboring county; but no sooner were they seen in his
      employment, than an immense crowd collected from all parts of the country,
      and after treating them with great violence, swore, every man of them,
      never to work for Purcel, or any other tithe-proctor whatever. This
      treatment exasperated the Purcels exceedingly; indeed, so much so, that
      they expressed to the people a wish that their house should be attacked,
      in order that they might thereby have an opportunity of shooting the
      assailants like dogs. In this way the feeling ran on between them day by
      day, until the acrimony and thirst for vengeance, on each side, had
      reached its utmost height. In the meantime, a tithe auction was to take
      place at a distance of some three or four miles from the Proctor's. On the
      morning when it was to take place, Mogue Moylan told Alick Purcel that he
      wished to speak to him. This scoundrel's plausibility was such, that he
      had continued to act the spy and traitor in the family, without exciting
      suspicion in the mind of any one, with the exception only of Jerry Joyce,
      who being himself involved in Whiteboyism, was placed in a position of
      great difficulty and danger. To have discovered Mogue's treachery, would
      not only criminate himself, by the necessity of admitting his connection
      with this illegal combination, which was a felony at the time, but it
      would also have probably occasioned the loss of his life, by betraying the
      designs of his confederacy, and thus proving himself, as it would have
      been termed, a traitor to the people, and to the cause of his country.
      Such, in truth, are the multifarious evils that result from illegal
      conspiracies among our impulsive and unreasoning countryman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a word or two I'd wish to spake to you, Mr. Alick."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Mogue, what's the matter? Are you still determined to be
      hard-hearted to poor Letty Lenehan?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I may never sup sorrow, Mr. Alick, if I can help the foolish
      creature! I do all I can to let her see that we are not aiquils; but the
      thoughtless girl won't be convinced. I belong to a family, sir, that
      always suffered for our counthry. Widin the last six hundre' years, I have
      it from sound authority, that there never was a ruction on Irish ground
      that wasn't the manes of havin' some o' them hanged or transported, glory
      be to God! An' you know, Mr. Alick, that's a proud boast, an' what every
      one couldn't say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All I can say then, Mogue, is, that if you look upon that as an honor, I
      have no objection that the fate should follow the family, and, I suppose,
      neither have you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, indeed now, and that I may never die in sin, but I think it an
      honor to oppose these Sassanagh laws; an', for that matther, to die
      opposin' them; however, as to myself, Mr. Alick, I am by nature of a
      peaceable, quiet turn, and not likely&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To grace a gibbet, Mogue: well, I believe not; but what is this you wish
      to say to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One or two things then, sir. First, I hear that Mr. M'Carthy is comin'
      down to stay wid the family here, bekaise they say it's going to be
      attacked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, is it not both a friendly and a manly offer for him to make?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Granted, Mr. Alick; but instead of help-in' you all to keep the danger
      off, he'll only be the manes of bringin' it on; for as soon as it becomes
      known that he's here, there will be ten enemies then for one there is now
      against you. I happened to overhear a discoorse at the chapel on Sunday
      last; and it's from that I'm givin' you my advice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't care a d&mdash;n," said the impetuous young man, "about their
      discourses at chapel. They go there more for the purpose of plotting
      murders, and entering into illegal combinations, than for that of praying
      sincerely or worshipping God! No; we despise and defy them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, Mr.&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Silence, Mogue; not another word on that subject. I am obliged to you, in
      the meantime, for you kindness, and the interest you feel for us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That my bed may be made in heaven, thin, but I do feel all you say; and
      why shouldn't I? But I said I had a thing or two to mention, an' although
      it goes against my heart to say it, still I like your family too well, not
      to throw you out a hint upon it. 'Tis regardin' Jerry Joyce, ay&mdash;an'
      Mr. M'Carthy too, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jerry Joyce and M'Carthy; well, what about them? Jerry's a rollicking
      shallow fool, but honest, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Mr. Alick, this is to be buried between you and me. I say, don't
      trust him; an' as for M'Carthy, it doesn't become the likes o' me to
      disparage him; but if there's not a traitor to this family in his coat,
      I'm not here. It's purty well known that he's a Whiteboy; he was a caravat
      it seems, two years agone, and was wid ould <i>Paudeen Gar</i> when Hanly
      was hanged for&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who was Paudeen Gar?" asked the other, interrupting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was the head o' the Shanavests, and it so happened, that one Hanly,
      who was head of the Moyle Bangers, as they wor called, was hanged only for
      burnin' the house of a man that tuck a farm over another man's head. Now
      the Shanavests and the Moyle Rangers, you see, bein' bitther enemies, the
      Shanavests prosecuted Hanly for the burning, and on the day of his
      execution, Paudeen Gar stayed under the gallows, and said he wouldn't lave
      the place till he'd see the <i>caravat</i> (* Carvat; fact&mdash;such is
      their origin) put about Hanly's neck; an' from that out the Moyle Bangers
      was never called anything but Caravats."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what does Shanavest mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It manes an ould waistcoat; that is, it's the Irish for an ould
      waistcoat, and Paudeen Gar's men were called Shanavests, bekaise when they
      went out to swear the people against tithes and priests' dues, they put
      ould waistcoats about them for fraid o' bein' known."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you tell me that McCarthy's a White-boy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wasn't he a night wid them? and didn't he come home in the mornin' wid
      his face blackened?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, but he accounted very satisfactorily for that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm a friend to your family, Mr. Alick; and what I tell you is thrue; an'
      by the same token, Miss Julia isn't safe in the one house wid him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, Mogue, don't attempt' to make any illusion of that kind. You
      are an honest but over-anxious fool, and like many a one in this world,
      would make mountains out of mole-hills."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sir," replied Mogue, somewhat downcast, "when the time comes I'll
      let you know why I say so. Don't trust either o' them, I say, for the
      present, at any rate; for I hope soon to know more about them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, Mogue," said Alick, laughing, "I'll keep my eye on them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do so, sir; an' as I'm spakin' to you as a friend that you may trust, I
      tell you, Mr. Alick, that although I'm quiet, as I said a while agone,
      still as there's likely to be danger to your family, I'd wish to help you
      to meet it, and to do whatever little I could in your defence&mdash;I
      would, indeed; but you know, Mr. Alick, I can't do that so long as I'm
      kept sleepin' in the out-houses. If I was allowed any kind of a shake-down
      in the house, I could do a good deal in the way of assistance. I could
      help you to load your fire-arms, or I could take charge of the ladies, and
      many other thing that I couldn't do out o' the house, so that was all I
      had to say to you, Mr. Alick."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Mogue; I really feel obliged to you; and I shall think over
      what you have said to me. If we admit any stranger to sleep in the house,
      with the exception of Mr. M'Carthy, you shall be the man; I will promise
      you that much, conditionally."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And not a word of what I hinted about Jerry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You need not be at all uneasy on that score; as I said, I shall keep my
      eye on him. We must now go to prepare for this auction, which, of course,
      so far as we are concerned, will be both an unpleasant and unprofitable
      affair. Go, then, and get the horses. We have also some processes to
      serve, and it will be necessary that we should see the bailiffs, to give
      them proper instructions, and directions to the houses on which they are
      to serve them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Mr. O'Driscol goin' wid you, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Mogue," replied Alick, laughing, "ever since the country has risen,
      as he calls it, Mr. O'Driscol. has lost his health. Indeed, ever since the
      day he was attacked at Philpot's Corner, by the four black faces, a fact
      which he has dignified with the name of insurrection, he has taken no
      active part in public life. He does nothing now but correspond with his
      friend the Castle, as he says."
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning on which this conversation took place was a dull, gloomy one,
      about the middle of December. It did not rain, but the weather had been
      dark and desolate in character for above a week before; in fact, of that
      cheerless description which represses animal spirits, and superinduces
      upon the mind impressions that are dreary and disheartening.
    </p>
    <p>
      A chief constable of police, accompanied by a body of forty men well
      armed, started from near the proctor's house, in order to execute a decree
      of the Court of Chancery, or rather to protect those who were about to do
      so, by first holding an auction, and serving a process from the same court
      afterwards, in another place. For the first mile or so there was not much
      notice taken of them; a few boys only, and some women, kept hooting and
      screaming at their heels as they went along. Within about two miles or so
      of the place of their destination, men began to appear upon the hills in
      increasing groups, and horns were soon sounding in every direction. This,
      however, was not all; on reaching a chapel, the bell began to ring, and,
      in a short time, as they advanced, the bells of the whole country around
      them were pealing rapidly and with violence. The crowds now began to
      coalesce, and to gather about them in such a manner that they, kept them
      completely hemmed in; and in this manner they proceeded, until they
      arrived at the premises on which the auction was to be held. The peasantry
      were formidably armed with every sort of weapon that the moment could
      supply; for, on such occasions as this, the people never used fire-arms.
      These, carried in the open day, might enable the police to know the
      persons of those who illegally possessed them, and, consequently, get such
      individuals into trouble. Their arms, on this occasion, consisted of
      pitchforks, spades, shovels, scythes, bill-hooks, and heavy sticks, whilst
      it was observed that several of those who carried these weapons in one
      hand, carried a round, destructive stone about two or three pounds'
      weight, in the other. A powerful man, who wore a sash across his
      shoulders, and a military cap that was peaked so as to conceal his face,
      appeared as leader, and seemed completely to direct and regulate their
      motions. The state of tumult throughout and over the face of the country
      was indeed frightful, and it is very likely that a chief constable and
      only forty police felt the danger of their position and the utter
      inadequacy of their numbers, either to carry the decrees of the law into
      execution, or to defend themselves, with anything like success, against
      the burning ferocity of the armed multitudes by whom they were surrounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the auction commenced, and the first article put up for
      competition was a fine heifer, but not an individual present would open
      his lips to bid for her; and, on a little further examination, it was
      ascertained that all the cattle had been branded with the word tithe, in
      large and legible characters. The family on whom the execution was about
      being levied, walked, about at their ease, and rather seemed to enjoy the
      matter, as a triumph over law, than as a circumstance that was calculated
      to depress or annoy them. They offered no obstruction; neither did they,
      on the other hand, afford the slightest possible facility to the officers
      of the law. They were strictly and to the letter passive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heifer alluded to having been put aside for want of a bidder, a fine
      cow was put up, and all the usual cajoling and seductive provocations to
      competition and purchase were held out, but in vain. Every nourish of the
      bailiff, who acted as auctioneer, was lost, as it were, on empty space,
      and might as well have been uttered in a desert. Butter-casks, kitchen'
      vessels, and everything on which the impress could be affixed, was marked
      with the hated brand of "tithe." No one, however, would bid; and when the
      bailiffs, on seeing that none present was either willing or courageous
      enough to do so, began to bid themselves, the silence of the people still
      remained unbroken. They then put up some furniture, all of which was
      branded "tithe;" but, on purchasing it for another market, they found that
      it was impossible to remove it, as neither horse nor cart, nor any
      available vehicle for that purpose, could be had at any cost. So far,
      therefore, the law and all its authority, supported besides by a large
      body of constabulary, were completely defeated, and it was obvious that,
      unless those on whom the perilous duty of executing it fell, came provided
      with the means of removing the property, that is to say, with horses,
      carts, and a body of military besides, every such auction must terminate
      in failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shortness of the day, and the distance they had to go, when taken in
      connection with the ferocious state of the people, prevented the bailiffs
      and their protectors from serving the process, to which we have alluded,
      on another party. It was therefore determined on to abandon the property
      for the present, and execute the service on the following day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning opened with the same dull, dark, and desolute appearance,
      as did the preceding. On this occasion, there was no auction to hold and
      but one process to serve, only a single bailiff was necessary. No
      diminution, however, was made in the number-of police who attended; and,
      indeed, the party selected for the service of this day ought rather to
      have been increased, inasmuch as the bailiff in question had rendered
      himself so justly obnoxious to the people, that it was fatuity itself to
      suppose that, smarting as they were under the scoundrel's wanton and
      obscene insults, it was possible they would suffer him to escape. The
      party had, consequently, no sooner set out, than the horns once more began
      to blow, the bells to ring, and the whole country around to stir into
      tumult and action. The same arms as we haye already mentioned were in
      requisition, with some old pike-handles, and an occasional rusty pike or
      two that may have seen service in '98.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the previous day the people had resolved to maintain an armed
      neutrality, and to observe, unless attacked, the spirit of passive
      resistance in its strictest sense. Now, however, the man who, confiding in
      and abusing the protection and authority of the Court of Chancery, had so
      grossly insulted them by language that was both indecent and unchristian;
      who had not only attacked their want of morals, but ridiculed their
      religion;&mdash;this person, we say, was within their grasp, and let what
      might be the result, they were determined, to a man, "<i>to have the
      process-server or blood</i>" for such was the expression. The people now
      shouted, and had evidently made up their minds, not only to secure the
      process-server, but to attack the police themselves, at any risk. Such was
      the apprehension of this, that their officer deemed it necessary to halt
      his party, and order them to prime and load, which they did. Whilst they
      halted, so did the assailants; but, upon resuming their march to the house
      of the tithe-defaulter, the crowds, who were every moment increasing in
      number and in fury, resumed their march also, gradually closing upon and
      coming nearly into contact with them. Indeed, they were now so close, that
      the object of all this preparation, and concert, and motion, could be
      distinctly ascertained from their language and demeanor. Ever and anon
      there arose from them, extending far and wide over the country, one
      general cry and exclamation, accompanied by menacing gestures and blazing
      eyes:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "The process-server or Blood!&mdash;Butler or blood!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This unfortunate individual, having put a copy of the process under the
      door, took his place in the centre of the police, who turned to the left
      of the house for the purpose of retreating; and it is to be deplored that
      the retreat in question was not conducted with more discipline and
      judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this occasion, as well as on that of the preceding day, the same person
      who acted as the popular leader was present, dressed as before, in a sash,
      and peaked cap that concealed the greater portion of his countenance,
      which was, besides, otherwise disguised. On arriving at the defaulter's
      house, this man took off his sash, lest it might make him a more
      conspicuous object for the police, in case of a recounter, and put it into
      his pocket, from which one end of it, however, protruded. Two other
      leaders held subordinate rank under him, a circumstance which gave to the
      whole proceedings a character of premeditated concert, and deliberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the house of the defaulter, the police, encircling the
      process-server, proceeded in a certain direction to a place called
      Tennison's Gate; but so closely were they now pressed upon by the
      multitude that they were obliged to keep them off with their bayonets.
      Their threats, their increasing numbers, and their irrepressible fury, now
      excited such alarm in the minds of the police, that one of them, calling
      to his officer, entreated him to take them into the open field, where
      alone their arms could afford them protection; or if not, he added, that
      they must fall a sacrifice to the vengeance of their enemies. At that
      instant, two or three of the leaders of the people were in commotion with
      that gentleman, one of them resting his hand upon his horse's neck, and
      the other so close to him that his words could be distinctly heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Captain G&mdash;&mdash;s," said the latter, "don't be afraid&mdash;meek
      yourself aisy&mdash;not a hair of your head, nor any of the police, will
      be touched; we only want the process-server; let him be given up, and you
      will be safe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sooner than give him up to you," he replied, "we will, every man of us,
      part with our lives. Sacrifice us you may, but we will never surrender our
      charge."
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead, however, of following the sound advice of one of his own men, the
      chief constable, credulous to infatuation, allowed the infuriated body, by
      which he and his men were surrounded, still to press in upon him, without
      taking those precautions which common sense, coolness, and the insecurity
      of his position, should have dictated.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time they had passed the place called Tennison's Gate, a large body
      had collected in their front, blocking up the road they had to pass, and
      which would have conducted, them in a different direction, but not one so
      peculiarly perilous. From this they made a turn to the left into a lane
      that would have led them back again to a little village, through which
      they had already passed, the bell of which was already sounding their
      death-knell. The constabulary, by turning into the narrow lane at the
      left, unconsciously approached the very ambush into which the people, or
      rather their more disciplined leaders, had intended to decoy them. This
      lane was enclosed by walls, and on one side the ground was considerably
      elevated and covered with stones, thus affording to their assailants every
      possible opportunity of completing their destruction. The unfortunate men
      were pressed by a crowd on their right, composed of those who occupied the
      elevation; another crowd pressed upon their rear; whilst a third body
      obstructed them in front, thus keeping them pent up, and at the mercy of
      the crowds on every side.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is quite obvious that the person in command of the constabulary was not
      only unfit for his duty, but ignorant of anything like military discipline
      or manoeuvring. He must have completely lost his presence of mind,
      otherwise his easiness of belief and simplicity are utterly unaccountable.
      As it was, in two or three minutes after the hollow assurances of
      good-will uttered by those whom he saw bristling at the same time with
      vengeance about him, an effort was made by a man to drag the unfortunate
      process-server out of the lines. He was immediately pulled back by a
      policeman, but was scarcely restored to his place, When he was struck on
      the side of the head with a wattle. The blow caused him to stagger, and
      would have caused him to fall, but that he was seized and kept upon his
      legs by the policeman. He had not time, however, to recover his
      steadiness, when he was felled to the ground by a blow from a stone, which
      sent him to the ground a corpse. A general assault with every description
      of rude and formidable weapons, now commenced upon the unfortunate
      constabulary. Their imbecile and uncautious officer fired his pistol and
      in a moment afterwards was knocked from his horse and instantly put to
      death. The crowd now rushed on them from all sides, and so sharp, short,
      and decisive was the massacre, that in about the space of two minutes,
      twelve men lay butchered on the spot.

      Other scenes of violence and bloodshed there were, but none so frightful
      as the above. Most persons remember Rathcormac and Newtonbarry, but we do
      not imagine that a recapitulation of such atrocities can be at all
      agreeable to the generality of our readers, and for this reason we content
      ourselves with barely alluding to them, as a corroboration of the
      disorganized condition of society which then existed, and which we are now
      attempting to describe.

      But perhaps nothing, after all, can test the inextinguishable hatred of
      tithes which prevailed at that period, more than the startling and almost
      incredible fact that the government, aided by as sound a lawyer, and as
      able an attorney-general as ever lived, and a powerful bar besides, were
      not able, during the following spring and summer assizes, to convict a
      single individual concerned in this massacre, which is now a portion of
      our country's history, and still well remembered as that of Carrickshock,
      in the county of Kilkenny.
    </p>
    <p>
      This double triumph of the people over the tithe and police, created a
      strong sensation throughout the kingdom, and even shook the two houses of
      parliament with dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, there probably never existed in Ireland, any combination or
      confederacy of the people so bitter, or with such a deeply-rooted hold
      upon the popular mind as that against tithes, as it slumbered and revived
      from time to time. And what is rather singular, too, the frequent
      agitations arising from it, which in its periodical returns convulsed the
      country, were almost uniformly, or at least very frequently, productive of
      a collateral one against priests' dues. Up until the year '31, however, or
      '32, the agitators against tithes were more for their reduction than their
      extinction. The reduction of tithes and priests' dues went, as we have
      said, very frequently together, or rather the one generally produced the
      other. The Threshers, in their early existence, were as active in their
      attempts to diminish the income of the priests by intimidation, as they
      were that of the parson. Their plan was, with white shirts over their
      clothes, and white handkerchiefs round their hats so as to conceal the
      features, to pay a nightly visit to some quiet and timid man, whom they
      swore, on pain of death, to visit the neighboring chapel in order to
      inform the priest, in the face of his own congregation, that unless he
      reduced the fees for marriage to half-a-guinea, those of baptism to
      nineteen-pence half-penny, and celebrate Mass for thirteen pence, he might
      prepare his coffin. If he got hay and oats for his horse at a station, he
      was at liberty to take them, but if not, he was to depart quietly, on pain
      of smarting for it. The unfortunate individuals on whom they imposed this
      painful and dangerous duty, were much to be pitied whilst this confederacy
      lasted. To submit to an illegal oath, without reporting the matter to the
      next magistrate, was a capital felony, as it was voluntarily to execute
      any of their criminal behests. If, then, the unfortunate individual
      pitched upon for the performance of this extraordinary office refused to
      discharge it, he was probably shot by the Threshers or Carders, and if he
      carried their wishes into effect, he was liable to be hanged by the
      government, so that his option lay between the relative comforts of being
      hanged or shot&mdash;a rather anomalous state of society, by the way.

      The vengeance of the people against Purcel and his sons had now risen or
      was fast rising, to its height. This intrepid man and these resolute young
      men, aided by the writs of rebellion and the executive authorities, had
      nerved themselves up to the collection of tithe, through a spirit that was
      akin to vengeance. In fact, they felt an inhuman delight&mdash;at least
      the father and his eldest son did&mdash;in levying the execution of the
      writs in the most pitiless and oppressive manner. They themselves provided
      horses and carts, and under protection of the military and police&mdash;for
      both were now necessary&mdash;they swept off cattle, crops, and furniture,
      at a ruinous value to the defaulters. At length they proceeded to the
      house of a struggling widow, whose only son, exasperated at the ruin which
      their proceedings had wrought upon his mother, in an unguarded moment,
      induced a few thoughtless boys like himself to resist the law. It was an
      act of folly for which his life paid the penalty. He was shot dead on the
      spot, and his death proved the signal for raising the gloomy curtain that
      veils the last of the drama in which the tithe-proctor makes his
      appearance.

      Soon after the death of this youth, John Parcel had occasion to go to
      Dublin, to transact some business with the Rev. Dr. Turbot, and on his way
      to the metropolis he was obliged to stop for more than an hour at the
      county town, to await the arrival of the mail-coach. As he lingered about
      the door of the coach-office, he noticed a crowd of persons corning down
      the street, bearing something that resembled a human figure on a beir. It
      was evidently the corpse of some person, but at the same time he felt it
      could not have been a funeral, inasmuch as he saw that it came from the
      churchyard instead of going to it. The body was covered with a mort-cloth,
      so that he could not ascertain whether it was that of a man or a woman.
      Walking at its head as a chief mourner does at a funeral, was an old man
      with gray hair, who appeared to have every feature of his venerable
      countenance impressed with the character of an affliction which no
      language could express. He neither spoke nor looked to either side of him,
      but walked onward in a stupor of grief that was evidently too deep for
      tears&mdash;for he shed none, his face was pale even unto ghastliness,
      whilst at the same time there was a darkness over it, which evidently
      proceeded from the gloom of a broken down and hopeless heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Purcel, after making some inquiry as to the cause of this singular
      procession, was enabled, from several of the by-standers, to ascertain the
      following affecting and melancholy particulars. The reader cannot forget
      the conversation between the proctor and his sons, concerning the murder
      of a certain farmer named Murray, in the early part of this narrative. The
      poor youth who had been appointed, under the diabolical system of
      Whiteboyism, to perpetrate that awful crime, was the very young man who,
      during the journey of the Whiteboys to the mountains, had held a kind of
      <i>sotto voce</i> conversation with the mysterious person who proved
      himself to be so sincere a friend to Frank M'Carthy. A misunderstanding
      for several years, or rather a feeling of ill-will, had subsisted between
      his father and Murray, and as this circumstance was known, the malignant
      and cowardly miscreants availed themselves of it to give a color of
      revenge to the murder, in order to screen themselves. At all events, the
      poor misguided youth, who had been stimulated with liquor, and goaded on
      to the commission of the crime, from fear of a violent death if he refused
      it, was tried, found guilty, and executed, leaving his childless father
      and mother, whose affections were centred in him, in a state of the most
      indescribable despair and misery. By the intercession and influence of
      friends, his body was restored to them, and interred in the churchyard,
      from which the procession just mentioned had issued. The heart, however&mdash;or
      to come nearer the truth&mdash;the reason of the mother&mdash;that loving
      mother&mdash;could not bear the blow that deprived her of her innocent boy&mdash;her
      pride, her only one. In about a week after his interment she proceeded one
      morning to his grave, bearing with her the breakfast which the poor youth
      had been accustomed to take. This, in fact, became her daily habit, and
      here she usually sat for hours, until in most cases her woe-stricken
      husband, on missing her, was obliged, by some pardonable fiction, to lure
      her home under the expectation of seeing him. This continued during
      spring, summer, autumn, and the greater portion of winter&mdash;up in fact
      until the preceding night. She had, some time during the course of that
      night, escaped from her poor, husband while he slept, and having entered
      the grave-yard by stone steps that were in a part of the wall&mdash;for a
      passage went through it&mdash;she reached her boy's grave, where it was
      supposed, after having for some time, probably until lassitude and sorrow,
      and a frame worn down by her peculiar calamity, had induced sleep&mdash;she
      was found dead in the course of the morning&mdash;an afflicting but
      beautiful instance of that undying love of a mother's heart, which
      survives the wreck of all the other faculties that compose her being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her miserable husband and friends were then bearing her body home, in
      order that it might be waked decently and with due respect, ere it should
      mingle with the ashes of him whom she had loved so well. So much for the
      consequences of being concerned in those secret and criminal
      confederacies, that commit such fatal ravages, not only in society, but in
      domestic life, and stand so strongly opposed to the laws of both God and
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Purcel, on reaching the metropolis, was a great deal astonished at the
      change which he observed in Dr. Turbot. That gentleman's double chin had
      followed the carnal fortunes of the church that supported it. The rosy
      dewlap, in fact, was no longer visible, if we except a slight pendulous
      article, which defied the whole nomenclature of colors to classify its
      tint, and was only visible when his head and neck assumed a peculiar
      attitude. In fact, the change appeared to Purcel to have been an
      exceedingly beneficial one. The gross carnal character of his whole
      appearance was gone; his person had become comparatively thin, and had a
      far and distant, but still an approximating, tendency to something of the
      apostolic. He was now leading by compulsion, a reasonable and natural
      life, and one not so much at variance with the simple principles of his
      religion, whatever it might be with those of the then establishment. His
      horses and carriages and powdered servants were all gone too, so was the
      rich air of wealth and costly luxury which formerly breathed throughout
      his fine mansion, in one of the most fashionable streets of the
      metropolis. His eye, no longer loaded by the bloodshot symptoms of an
      over-fed and plethoric constitution, was now clear and intellectual, and
      there appeared to be an unencumbered activity about his jaws that argued a
      vigor and quickness of execution in matters of a sumptuary character,
      which, when gross and unwieldy from luxury, they never could reach. He was
      by no means in his usual spirits, it is true, but then he was in much
      better health, and a vague report of something in the shape of a loan to
      the clergy, to the tune of a million, gave him a considerable degree of
      cheerfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Purcel, having dispatched his business with him as quickly as he
      could, called upon M'Carthy in college. This gentleman having, in fact,
      heard such an account of the threats and determinations of vengeance with
      which the Purcel family were threatened, had felt deep anxiety as to their
      fate. He had written more than once to them on the subject, entreating
      that, as their wealth had rendered them independent, they would remove
      either to Lisnagola or Dublin. This, however, was a determination to which
      they had come recently themselves, and one portion of John's business to
      the metropolis was connected with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day previous to Purcel's visit to M'Carthy, that young man had
      received the following short and somewhat mysterious communication from
      the country:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. M'Carthy.&mdash;Sir&mdash;If you wish to save some of Mr. Purcel's
      family&mdash;save them all you cannot&mdash;and if you have courage, and
      isn't afraid to risk your life, you will come down to Longshot Lodge and
      wait there till you here more from 'One that has proved himself your
      Friend'."
    </p>
    <p>
      This determined M'Carthy; and when John Purcel asked him to spend the
      Christmas with them, he felt gratified at the alacrity with which the
      other embraced his offer. The next morning they started for Longshot
      Lodge, and in due time were cordially greeted by the proctor and his
      family.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day before Christmas&mdash;universally known as Christmas Eve&mdash;at
      length arrived. On that morning, our friend Mr. Temple and his family were
      seated at breakfast with easy and cheerful hearts, when the following
      conversation took place; and we introduce it for the purpose of gratifying
      our readers, who, we are certain, will rejoice in hearing the
      circumstances that form its subject matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charles, my dear, I always knew that my dear grandpapa was a kind and
      forgiving man; and, to tell the truth, I felt a conviction that such
      sincerity of heart, and such unexampled purity of purpose as yours, would
      not be permitted long to suffer. Read the letter again my love."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband, whose mild features were absolutely radiant with an
      expression of delight&mdash;an expression that was elevated, besides, with
      a glow of fervent and devotional feeling&mdash;now read the letter again,
      which was to the following effect:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Maria,&mdash;I do not think that a man of my years&mdash;now near
      seventy-two&mdash;who feels how many duties he has neglected in this life,
      and who, consequently, knows how much he requires to be forgiven, ought
      any longer to class himself with those who are disposed to withhold their
      pardon from human error. I wrote some time ago to your father, requesting,
      nay, commanding him, to suffer himself to be reconciled to you; but his
      reply was, that, although he was not averse to it in due time, yet he said
      that for the present he must decline it&mdash;not so much, he added, for
      want of affection for you, as that he might the more strongly manifest a
      sense of his displeasure at your conduct, in throwing yourself away upon
      an 'educated beggar.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The hectic of a moment, as Sterne beautifully says, came across his fine
      and handsome features as he uttered the words; and he added, "He forgets,
      my love, that my family is not, as your grandpapa says, inferior to his
      own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not dwell on that, dearest Charles," she added, "but let us hear good
      old grandpapa out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear Maria, I differ with your papa; Mr. Temple was not an
      educated beggar, but an educated and accomplished gentleman, whose family,
      in point of blood and birth; is equal even to ours. Still, my love, you
      know that on many accounts, and as persons to whom you were so justly
      dear, and who felt such a strong interest in your settlement and position
      in life, we had reason to feel offended at the step you took in marrying
      him. That, however, is past&mdash;and now let it be forgotten. Your papa
      still loves you tenderly, my Maria; for I could observe that in a passage
      where he said it was necessary that you should suffer a little longer,
      there were the marks of tears&mdash;and of tears too, that fell thickly.
      Now, however, for something that will cheer my own favorite. I have
      succeeded in getting Mr. Temple appointed to the living of Ballynolan, in
      a safe and quiet part of the country, not many miles from Drumgooran
      Castle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you know my dear Charles, is his own family seat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know, my love, it is; however, to proceed&mdash;from Drumgooran Castle;
      so that I will once more enjoy the pleasure of having you near me.. The
      living is worth about five hundred a-year, after paying two curates and
      all other claims; so that, with frugality and moderation, you may live
      comfortably at least. Ah! my dear Maria, you knew the avenue to
      grandpapa's affections, when you called your eldest son after him. Present
      him with the enclosed, in my name, and tell Mr. Temple that he shall have
      a communication from me in a few days&mdash;it will be one of business;
      and I trust soon to have the pleasure of making his acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am, my dear Maria, your ever affectionate grandfather,
    </p>
    <p>
      "TAVNIMORE."
    </p>
    <p>
      The enclosure alluded to was a bank post-bill for two hundred pounds. It
      is unnecessary, however, to dwell upon the happiness which this
      communication conferred upon Mrs. Temple and her affectionate family. She
      saw her accomplished and amiable husband's brilliant talents and many rare
      virtues, about to be rewarded&mdash;she saw poverty, distress, and famine
      driven from their hearth&mdash;she saw her beloved children about to be
      placed in circumstances not unbecoming their birth; and, having
      contemplated all this, she wept once more with a sense of happiness, as
      pure as it was unexpected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast was now over&mdash;a plain and severely frugal one, by the way,
      it was&mdash;and her husband was about to proceed to Lisnisgola, in order
      to get the bank post-bill changed, when, from the parlor where they sat,
      he saw the <i>Cannie Soogah</i> approaching the hall-door, the huge pack,
      as usual, on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, my love, comes that benevolent pedlar," he exclaimed, "whose
      conduct, on the occasion you mentioned, was at once so delicate and
      generous."
    </p>
    <p>
      He then stepped to the window, and raised it as our friend approached,
      who, on seeing him, put his hand to his hat, exclaiming, "Many happy
      returns of the saison, sir, to you and your family! My Christmas-box on
      you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you, my friend," replied Mr. Temple, "and I sincerely wish you
      the same."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Temple now approached also, bent her head kindly and condescendingly,
      in token of salutation, with a blush which she could not prevent. The
      worthy pedlar perfectly understood the blush&mdash;a circumstance by which
      he was a good deal embarrassed himself, and which occasioned him to feel
      in rather a difficult position. He felt flattered, however, by her
      condescension; and instead of merely touching his hat to her he pulled it
      off and stood respectfully uncovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put on your hat, my friend," said Temple; "the morning is too cold to
      stand with a bare head&mdash;pray put it on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know, your honor," replied the pedlar, "the respect that is due to you
      both, and especially, sir," he added, in that tone, and with that peculiar
      deference, so gratifying to a husband who loves and is proud of his wife&mdash;"especially,
      sir, to her, for I know her family well&mdash;as who doesn't!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the way," said Mrs. Temple, "I think you committed a mistake on the
      occasion of your last call here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A mistake, ma'am!" said he, with well-feigned surprise&mdash;"well,
      indeed, ma'am, it's not unlikely; for, to tell you the truth, I've a vile
      mimory&mdash;sorra thing a'most but I disremimber, in a day or two after
      it happens."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you not remember," she proceeded, with a melancholy smile, "a
      negotiation we had when you were here last?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A what, ma'am?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A&mdash;a&mdash;purchase you made from me," she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      "From you!" he exclaimed, with apparent astonishment; "well, then, I can't
      say that I have any recollection of it&mdash;I remember something&mdash;that
      is, some dalins or other I had wid the maid, but I don't remember
      purchasin' anything from you, ma'am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was a shawl," she replied, "which you purchased, if you remember, and
      paid for, but which you forgot to bring with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, then," he exclaimed, after rubbing his head with his fore-finger,
      "bad cess to me if I can remimber it; but the truth is, ma'am, I make so
      many purchases, and so many sales, that like the priest and them that
      confess to him, the last thing fairly drives the one that went afore it
      out o' my head."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You paid six guineas," continued Mrs. Temple, "for the shawl, but left it
      behind you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, bedad, ma'am," said the pedlar, smiling, "it's aisy to see that
      you're no rogue, at any rate. In the present case, thin," he added, "I
      suppose you wish to give me the shawl?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, certainly," she replied, "if you wish for it; but at the same time I
      would much rather keep the shawl and return you the money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm in no hurry, ma'am for either shawl or money, if it isn't&mdash;hem&mdash;if
      it isn't just convanient."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are an honest, sterling fellow," said her husband, "and I assure you
      that we thoroughly appreciate your delicacy and worth. I know Mrs. Temple
      would prefer keeping the shawl, and if you will call in the course of the
      evening, I shall return the money to you. I must first go into Lisnagola
      to get change for a note."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir," replied the Cannie, "but it is time enough&mdash;I am in
      no hurry at all&mdash;not the laist; it will do when I call again.. And
      now that that's settled&mdash;and many thanks to you, ma'am," he added,
      bowing to Mrs. Temple, "for thinkin' of it, I'd be glad to have a word or
      two wid you, sir, if you plaise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," said Mr. Temple, going to the hall-door, and opening it,
      "come in a moment; leave your pack in the hall there, and come this way."
    </p>
    <p>
      He then proceeded to the library, whither the pedlar followed him; and
      after looking about him with something like caution, he said, "You know
      Mr. Purcel, the proctor, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I do," replied Mr. Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not askin' it as a question," he proceeded; "but I wish to say, that
      as you do know him and his sons, it's possible you may save them from
      destruction. I was tould by a stranger that I never seen before, and that
      I didn't know from Adam, that his house is to be attacked either this
      night or to-morrow night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you not say which?" asked Mr. Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied the Cannie Soogah; "I axed the stranger the same question,
      and he couldn't tell me. Now, sir, you know them, and I know how much they
      respect you; and the thing is this,&mdash;I think if you'd see them, and
      thry to get them to go to Lisnagola, or some safe place, takin' their
      lives and money along wid them, you'd save them from murdher; they'd be
      apt to listen to you; but as for me, or the likes o' me, they'd laugh at
      me; indeed, they're rather wishin' for an attack, in hopes they might get
      revenge upon the people, for, to tell you the truth, they've been foolish
      enough to say so; an' as their words has gone abroad, the people's
      determined, it seems, to let them know which o' them is strongest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," replied the curate, "I am sorry to hear this&mdash;it is dreadful.
      That they are unpopular&mdash;nay, detested&mdash;I know; as I do, also,
      that they have latterly gone daring lengths&mdash;oppressive and
      unjustifiable lengths &mdash;in collecting tithes. I shall, however, see
      them, and endeavor to make them take refuge in some place of security."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be a good act," said the pedlar, "and if I can do anything,
      humble as I am, to save them, I'll do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think they ought to get a party of police to protect the house,"
      observed Mr. Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know they ought, sir," replied the pedlar, "but the truth is, they're
      so proud and foolhardy, that the very mention of such a thing throws them
      into a fury."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is unfortunate," said the other. "At all events, I shall leave
      nothing undone within my power to prevail on them to take steps for their
      security. You may rely on it," he added, "that whatever I can do for that
      purpose, I shall do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, now," said the Cannie, "my mind, thank God's, aisier. I'll lose no
      time myself in seein' what I can do to prevent this business; that is, I
      mane, their stayin' in the house," he added, as if checking or correcting
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then bade Mr. Temple good morning, and hurried away, without waiting to
      see his fair friend, Lilly, as was his custom to do.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII.&mdash;Midnight Court of Justice
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &mdash;Sentence of the Proctor and His Sons.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Breakfast in the proctor's, on the morning of Christmas Eve, was eaten as
      if it had been a funeral meal. The proctor himself could not raise his
      spirits, which were generally high and cheerful. John and Alick were much
      more serious than usual; and were it not for the presence of M'Carthy, the
      meal in question would have been a very gloomy one indeed. Even M'Carthy
      himself felt the influence of the spirit that prevailed, and found that
      all his attempts to produce cheerfulness or mirth among them were by no
      means successful. The two sons, as if acting under the influence of some
      unaccountable presentiment, engaged themselves in casting bullets for the
      fire-arms with which the house was furnished, whilst M'Carthy spent his
      time with the ladies, and endeavored to amuse them as well as ha could.
      About twelve o'clock John rode into the town of Lisnagola to bring home a
      blunderbuss which he had sent the day before, by Mogue Moylan, for the
      purpose of having it furnished with a new ramrod. Mogue being engaged in
      some matters of a pressing nature, John determined to go for it himself,
      especially as he wanted to lay in a better supply of powder. Of this Mogue
      knew nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Temple soon made his appearance, but, as the pedlar feared, the object
      of his visit was not attended with success. He urged all the arguments in
      his power upon the proctor and his son Alick, to remove instantly, and at
      once, to Lisnagola, or some other neighboring town, where, for the
      present, they might be safe. Instead of listening to the argument of
      instant removal, they laughed it to scorn. In the course of the following
      week, they said, it was their intention to remove; but to think of
      breaking up their family on a Christmas Eve, with a guest in their house
      too!&mdash;the thing was out of the question. A few days made no great
      difference; and their mind was fixed not to disturb their family or their
      guest, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after Mr. Temple had gone, Julia Purcel met M'Carthy in the hall, and
      asked him for a moment to the dining-room, in a voice which was tremulous
      with agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! Frank," she exclaimed, whilst the tears streamed from her eyes, "I
      feel a weight like that of death upon my heart. I fear there is some
      dreadful calamity hanging over this family."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, my dear Julia," he replied, wiping the tears from her eyes, "will
      you suffer yourself to be overcome by a weakness of mind so unworthy of
      you? The morning is dark and gloomy, and calculated, apart from such silly
      anticipations&mdash;pardon me, Julia&mdash;to fill the mind with low
      spirits. Cheer up, my dear girl; is not this season, in a peculiar manner,
      set apart for cheerfulness and enjoyment? Why, then, will you indulge in
      this weak and foolish melancholy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would not feel as I do," she replied, "but the truth is&mdash;now do
      not scold me, Frank&mdash;in fact I had an omen of calamity last night!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An omen! how is that?" he asked. "On bidding my papa and John goodnight,
      as I was going to bed, about eleven o'clock, I saw them both standing
      below me at the foot of the stairs, in the hall. I started, and turning
      again into the drawing-room, where I had just left them, saw that there
      they certainly stood, without scarcely having had time to change their
      position."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A mere physical illusion, my dear Julia; nothing else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But is it not said," she added, "that to see the likeness of an
      individual late at night is an omen of almost immediate death?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It has been said so, I admit, my dear Julia, as have fifty thousand
      follies equally nonsensical. But to hear you, Julia, talk in this manner!
      upon my word, I'm surprised at it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will not think of leaving us, dear Frank, until we get to a place of
      safety?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unquestionably not; but you are alarming yourself unnecessarily."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, perhaps I am," she said, gaining confidence from his firmness of
      manner; "but I assure you, Frank, I am not timid, nor a coward. I can load
      a gun, pistol, or blunderbuss, and what is better still, can discharge
      them without shrinking; so can my sister; but with respect to anything of
      a supernatural character&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a great coward. I perceive that; but, my dear Julia, to pass to a
      subject of the deepest interest to my happiness:&mdash;why is it that
      there has been an appearance of gloom and distrust about you for such a
      length of time? I think there should be nothing but the most unbounded
      confidence between us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you been perfectly candid with me, Frank?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you remember, dear Julia, you did not afford me an opportunity. You
      looked as if you felt offended, and I could perceive that you had
      withdrawn your confidence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My mind is too much distracted now," she replied, "to speak on this
      subject; but, if you wish it, I shall tell you, on Monday next, why I have
      appeared so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wish it! alas! my dear Julia, I can only say that my affection for you
      knows no bounds. Julia, you know I have loved you; and, happen what may, I
      shall carry that affection for you to my grave. Only say that the
      affection which you have already confessed for me is not cooled or
      diminished; only say it, dearest life, and you will relieve my heart of a
      heavy load."
    </p>
    <p>
      She fixed her beautiful dark eyes upon him, as if she were in the act of
      scrutinizing his very spirit; at length, she seemed to have arrived at a
      fixed conclusion; two or three tears slowly followed each other down her
      cheeks, and she replied, "I fear, Frank, I have been led to do you
      injustice; that is, to doubt your truth or your honor; yes," she added, in
      a low confiding voice, "I feel that I love you as I ever did. But I am
      depressed, and my heart is full of an unaccountable sorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My ever&mdash;ever dear&mdash;dearest Julia!" he exclaimed, as he pressed
      her to his heart; where she sobbed, and tenderly reacknowledged her love.
      "On Monday, however," she observed, after having somewhat composed
      herself, "I shall tell you, at full length, the circumstances that have
      disturbed me with respect to you." Another kiss as they separated, and so
      it was arranged between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mogue Moylan heard that John purcel had gone to the gunsmith's for
      the blunderbluss, he stealthily sought the barn where he slept, and,
      putting on a great frieze coat, he went to the haggard; approached the
      stack, and thrusting his hand up the thatch, secured a case of pistols
      that had been left with him and Jerry Joyce for their defence, and fixing
      them under his coat, deliberately took his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll have betther luck," he said to himself, "to join the boys, and as I
      have my own party among them that'll stand to me, we'll have the best
      chance. I'm to take charge o' the girls for him, after the men's shot; an'
      it'll go hard if I don't do him out o' the one he's set upon. If I sted in
      the house, as I intended at first, maybe it's a bullet from the boys I'd
      get into me. No&mdash;no&mdash;every way&mdash;think of it as I will, it's
      my wisest plan to cut; an' at any rate, he'd find me out now about the
      blunderbuss. Have her, however, I will, or lose a fall for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was Mogue's last appearance but one about the proctor's
      establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Purcel, on inquiring for the blunderbuss at the gunmaker's heard that
      Mogue had waited until the ramrod was put in, after which the man said he
      brought it home; a fact which Purcel never doubted. On the contrary, he
      felt annoyed at his own stupidity for not having asked Mogue the question
      before he went; and he consequently blamed himself more than he did Mogue.
      On his way home, however, he met Mogue; and it is necessary to state that
      none of the Purcel family returned to their house, for a considerable time
      past, by the same way, unless indeed very rarely. Mogue had come out upon
      the road, which he was crossing just as John turned a corner, and came
      plump upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the reason, Mogue," he asked, "That you didn't let me know you
      had brought home the blunderbuss?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I may be happy, Mr. John, but it was bekaise you didn't ax me; an' a
      beautiful new ramrod it has now, at any rate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are you bound for, Mogue?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, up to Harry Sproule's for paper and writin' things for the ladies.
      Any news in Lisnagola, Mr. John?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing that's good, at any rate," replied the other; "except that the
      country, Mogue, must be put under martial law."
    </p>
    <p>
      He set spurs to his horse on uttering these words, and immediately rode
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay," said Mogue, as he looked bitterly after him, "there you go, you
      blasted tyrant!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Martial law! Ah, if I had her from among you, I didn't care the divil's
      blazes had you all, as they will soon; an' that may be, I pray Jasus this
      day! Martial law! ah, bad luck to you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching home, John Purcel made no immediately inquiry about the
      blunderbuss, having taken it for granted that all was right, nor was
      Mogue's disappearance or treachery at all suspected, until late in 'the
      course of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twilight was now setting in, when a strange man called at the proctor's
      and said he wished to speak with Mr. M'Carthy. M'Carthy came to the
      hall-door, and looking at him keenly inquired his business.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," said the man; "I can only tell you what I was desired to
      say to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, let us hear even that," said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was bid to ax you, if you wish to sarve this family."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do, most certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, then, you're to follow me," said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no such intention, I assure you, my good fellow," replied the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, then, I have done my duty," said the man, turning to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said our friend, "will you not let me know who it was that sent
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you," replied the stranger, "that I don't know. I was bid to say
      to you that the hour is come, and the man, and that's all I know; barrin'
      that as I said you wor bid to come wid me, if you wish to sarve thia
      family. Now I must go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop a moment," said M'Carthy, "till I return into the house, and let
      them know I'm going out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied the other; "if you do, you won't find me here when you come
      back. This instant, or never."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To serve this family, you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To sarve this family, I was bid to say. I know nothing, an' can say
      nothing about it myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, then," said M'Carthy, resolutely, and thinking of the note he had
      received in college, "I trust you, or rather I will trust the man that
      sent you;" and having uttered these words, he departed with the stranger.
      The scene now changes to a hill, three or four miles distant from the
      proctor's house, called Crockaniska, at the foot of which was a small but
      beautiful lake or tarn, from which a graceful little stream fell down into
      a green and picturesque valley, that lay to the south below it. The shades
      of evening were beginning to deepen, but for a considerable time before,
      the road that went past it was observed to be more than usually-thronged
      with men, some on foot and others on horseback; all presenting a solemn
      and determined aspect, as if bent upon some dangerous enterprise that must
      be accomplished, and all apparently strangers to the inhabitants of the
      place, and to each other. On the brow of the hill stood a picturesque
      ruin, and the hill itself was literally covered with men and horses; for
      it was evident, by the fatigued and travel-stained appearance of both,
      that they had come from a far distance. After dusk had set in, the crowd
      assumed an appearance of stern repose, but at the same time, and somewhat
      contrasting with this dreadful stillness, pale lights might be seen
      flitting from time to time through the ragged apertures, and vacant
      windows of the ruin. Inside this dreary old building were those who, from
      the greater respectability of their dress, appeared to be their leaders;
      men of trust and authority among them, by whose will and opinions they
      were to be guided. A table and chairs, provided on this occasion, were
      placed for the transaction of business, and on these, after some
      proceedings, conducted with a good deal of form, had been transacted,
      twelve comfortably, if not well-dressed looking farmers sat, whilst on
      another chair, considerably elevated above the rest, a person in the garb
      at least of a gentleman, seemed to preside over, and regulate the business
      of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short silence, the judge asked, in an audible voice, if there was
      any business to be brought before "The Court of Right," on that occasion.
      He was immediately answered, in a solemn and almost melancholy tone of
      voice, that there was a great deal of business before the court, but that
      only one case, that of Captain Right against Purcel Senior and sons, was
      for hearing and adjudication on that occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing the name of Purcel, the judge took from his pocket a broad,
      blood-red ribbon, as did also each of the twelve farmers who constituted
      the jury, and having tied it about his left arm, in which they imitated
      him, he composed himself for the resumption of business. The ribbons were
      a twofold symbol, signifying, in the first place, that the Purcels had
      shed the blood of the people, and were to be tried for murder; and in the
      second, that if found guilty, the sentence of Captain Right would exact
      from them the fearful penalty of blood for blood. A compact, well knit,
      and intelligent young man, about twenty-six years of age, now rose up, and
      unrolling a long scroll of paper, read in a low but distinct voice, a long
      and dark series of charges preferred by the aforesaid Captain Right
      against the said Matthew Purcel and his sons. That person, on this
      occasion, was the representative of Captain Right.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge then observed, that the charges must be proved to the
      satisfaction of the jury, and called upon Captain Right's advocate to
      substantiate them. It would spin out our description to a fatiguing
      length, were we to go through all the cases of oppression, fraud, and
      cruelty, that were brought home to the unfortunate proctor; against whom,
      if we are to take him as the exponent of his heartless class, every one of
      them was strictly true.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was found guilty, for instance, of taking&mdash;often beforehand, or in
      reversion&mdash;several small farms over the heads of poor but solvent
      tenants; turning them adrift on the world, and consolidating their
      holdings into one large stock farm for grazing; there by adding to the
      number of the destitute, and diminishing the supply of food for the
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was found guilty of paying to his laborers the wretched sum of only
      eightpence a day; which he paid by the vile truck system&mdash;that is to
      say by forcing them to take potatoes, milk, meal, &amp;c, at nearly twice
      what the same commodities brought in the open market.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sons were found guilty of insolence and cruelty, against such poor and
      distressed persons as had occasion to go to the proctor's office, for the
      purpose of asking indulgence, or time to meet their engagements. Their
      insolence and cruelty consisted in giving abusive language to, and
      horsewhipping them as if they were not men, or possessed of the same
      rights, privileges, and feelings, as themselves. These were only a few of
      the charges, involving petty tyranny, oppression, and rapacity, against
      Purcel and his sons; but the last, and greatest, and most odious of them
      all, was the ruin he had brought, upon so many, by his tithe exactions,
      and the expenses he had heaped on them by processes of law, in recovering
      that blood-stained impost, as it was not improperly called.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those were all proved by witnesses, and although we must admit, that the
      great body of the evidence was true, in point of fact, yet there was not a
      word said, of the insolence, threatening language, falsehood, evasion, and
      defiance, which Purcel and his sons had in general experienced from the
      people, before they had been forced to have recourse, in matters of tithe,
      to such harsh proceedings against them. When the case for Captain Right
      was about to close, there was a slight stir, and a low indistinct murmur
      ran through those who thronged the ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is another charge still to come," said the young man who conducted
      the prosecution; "we pass by the three massacres, and all the blood that
      was shed in them; and all the sorrow and misery, and affliction that they
      occasioned&mdash;we pass them by, I say, and to show all here present that
      we are not like Purcel and his sons, resolved to avail ourselves of any
      advantage against those we prosecute, I will just confine myself to one
      case of murder, instead of many&mdash;because you all know, that if they
      are found guilty upon one count, it will be sufficient for our purpose.
      Widow Flanagan, come up and prove your sorrowful case."
    </p>
    <p>
      A pale, emaciated woman, whose countenance was the very reflex of
      affliction and despair, now was assisted to make her way from the further
      part of the building. She was dressed in the deepest mourning, with the
      exception of the ribbons, which were, like the rest, a deep blood-red, as
      an indication that one of her family had been murdered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Widow Flanagan," said the counsel for Captain Right, "will you have the
      goodness to state your distressing case?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, no!" she exclaimed; "I'll not state it&mdash;I'm beginnin' to
      fear what your intentions is this night; and as for me, I'll not help you,
      by act or word, to fulfil that fearful intention. Oh, change it!" she
      exclaimed; "there has been too much blood shed in the country; too much
      bad work every way in it. Call upon God to change your hearts, and go home
      to your families while your hands isn't yet stained with blood! You all
      know what the law is when it's let loose upon you, as it ought be,
      whenever you commit murther, and take away your fellow-crature's life. I
      forgive Purcel and his sons; it was neither him nor them that took my
      boy's life, but the sogers&mdash;oh, no!" she exclaimed, "I see what
      you're bint on, and why you are sittin' to try the unfortunate Purcels. I
      read it in your black fearful looks, and dark faces&mdash;may God turn
      your hearts, and forgive you for bringin' me here this night! Surely you
      ought to know that one like me, who suffered so much by the spillin' of
      blood, wouldn't wish to see my fellow-cratures sufferin' as I am? Oh, no!
      I forgive the Purcels, and why shouldn't you? an' the worst prayer I have
      for them is, that God may forgive them and change their hearts!" Alas!
      that we should say so, but the truth is, that no charge against Purcel,
      how bitter and malignant soever it might have been, could have occasioned
      such a deep-seated and uncontrollable vengeance against the unfortunate
      family, as the language of this extraordinary and great-minded peasant
      woman. There was nothing further said at the moment, every attention was
      paid to her wishes; in accordance with which a party of men and horses
      were sent to convey her safely home.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was gone, a neighbor of hers, who was present, came forward, and
      made an accurate and affecting statement of the circumstances connected
      with the death, or, as he termed it, and as we fear it was the murder of
      her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The poor, lovin' boy's mother," he proceeded, "the heart-broken Christian
      woman, that you all seen and heard this night, was not long after a fit of
      sickness. She was barely able to move about, but not to work or do
      anything in the house. When they came out to take away their property, she
      had two cows, but only one of them gave any milk. They wor axed to take
      the dry cow and any other part of the property they might think proper,
      but, 'for God's sake!' said the boy, 'as my poor mother is only risin' out
      of her illness, lave us the cow that can give her the drop of milk; the
      black water will kill her if you don't.' But no, this they wouldn't do;
      but what did they do? Why, they left the dry cow behind them, and tuck
      away the one that gave the kindly drop o' milk to the sick widow and her
      poor family; they then brought off&mdash;ay&mdash;swept away&mdash;six
      times the amount of what she owed; which they bought in for a song. It's
      well known that of late Purcel and his sons swore that they'd execute
      every process in the sevairest and most expensive manner upon the people,
      and as they kept their oath I hope too we'll keep ours. Well, it was when
      the poor boy saw the drop o' milk, as he said, goin' from his poor mother,
      that he opposed them. You all know the rest; he was shot stone-dead
      bekaise he loved that mother. The case is now in your hands, and this is
      all I have to say, barrin' to ask you, gintlemen of the jury, to take a
      look at this, and think of him it belonged to, that's now laid low in an
      airly and untimely grave, through Mat Purcel and his sons."
    </p>
    <p>
      He then placed a lock of fair and beautiful hair, which had been taken
      from the youth's brow, in the hands of the foreman, and resumed his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, human nature! especially Irish human nature, what a mystery art thou!
    </p>
    <p>
      The foreman, on receiving it, held it in his hands for some time, and so
      completely was he touched by the beauty of the tress, and the affection of
      him to whom it had belonged, that the tears gushed from his eyes; and as
      these men, who were then in the very act of trampling upon the laws of God
      and men, looked at it, one by one, there was scarcely a dry eye among
      them. As water, however, is frequently sprinkled over fire, in order to
      enkindle it into a more scorching heat, so did the tears they shed add
      fresh strength and fury to the vengeance which smouldered within them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This closed the case for Captain Right, and the judge asked if there was
      any one present prepared with a defense for Mat Pur-eel and his sons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our old friend, Darby Hourigan, who dressed himself in rags for the
      occasion, then came forward; and, after pulling up the waistband of his
      breeches, and twisting his revolting features into what he designed for,
      but what no earthly being could suppose, a grin, he spoke as follows:&mdash;"My
      lard, an' gintlemen o' the jury, it 'ud be a hard case if we suffered poor
      Misther Purcel and his two daicent, ginerous, kind-hearted sons, to be
      condimed 'idout a word at all in their definse. First, then, is it fair
      that we should be angry bekaise one of our own race and rallagion should
      spring up from among ourselves, and take his station over us like the
      Cromwellian shoneens, that are doin' oppression upon uz and our shildres!
      An', hadn't he as good a right to get the law at his back as they have?
      an' to make it bring him through the same hard-hearted coorses that made
      him rich and keep us poor? What had he done but what others had been doin'
      for ages, an' wor doin' still? ay, by jabers, an' 'ud continue to do
      unless the people put a stop to it. Worn't his sons gintlemen no less?
      Didn't they go out to hunt dressed in top-boots, buck-skin breeches,
      scarlet coats, and velvet jockey-caps; and didn't his daughters ride about
      upon blood-horses an' side-saddles? An' why are they called blood-horses
      do yez know? Ah, by jabers, if yez don't I'll tell you&mdash;it's bekaise
      they wor bought and maintained by the blood of the poor? Ay, they do all
      this, but if they do, who's to blame them? Poor! ershisin! Arra what was I
      sayin'? Sure they do it bekaise we all have plenty to ait and dhrink,
      plenty to wear; good coats to our backs, like this"&mdash;and here he
      shook the rags he dangled about him in hundreds; "good breeches to&mdash;hem&mdash;no
      matther&mdash;good shoes and stockings to our feet; good heads to our hats&mdash;hut!
      I mane good hats to our heads&mdash;and fusht-rate linen to our shkins; ay&mdash;sich
      as this," he added again. "Whisht!" he exclaimed, with a laugh like an
      Eclipse, "bad luck to the fatther of it, but I forgot at home&mdash;along
      wid the other eleven&mdash;or stop&mdash;here it is to the good still,"
      pointing to his naked skin, "an' be my sowl, boys&mdash;my lard an'
      gintlemen o' the jury, I mane&mdash;it's the weavor of this linen that'll
      stand to us yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gintlemin, I do maintain that there's a great dale to be said for Mat
      Purcel. To be sure he skrewed the last fardin' out of uz, but where was
      there ever a tithe-procthor that didn't do the same thing? An' sure if he
      tuck as much as he could from huz, an' gev as little as he could to the
      parson, wasn't it all so much the betther? Wasn't it weakenin' their fat
      church and fattening our weak on'?&mdash;where's the honest Catholic could
      say a word aginst that? To be sure, we all know that, by his knowledge of
      farmin', and all the ins and outs of our little tillage, he contrived, one
      way or other, to take about the fifth of our little produce; but then if
      he did, didn't he say it was all by way of friendship an' indulgence to
      us? Sure didn't himself tell us that only he pitied us an' felt for us,
      he'd a' been ten times harsher than he was, an' so he would, be coorse,
      an' 'tis thankful we have a right to be, an' not grumblin' at all at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hould half a dozen could an' miserable acres, an' about three weeks
      ago, he tuck about one-fourth of the whole produce, owin' to citations to
      the bishop's coorts, an' a long string o' costs jined to the tithe itself&mdash;bad
      luck to it!&mdash;an' didn't he prove to me that he let me off for a song,
      an' was the best-hearted procthor that ever strewed a defaulther? Well,
      an' isn't every small farmer, that doesn't wish to go law, or isn't able
      to right himself, as well off as I am&mdash;glory be to God! I declare,
      thin, I don't see why we should be angry wid so kind an' merciful a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thin, again, it made a man religious, an' was aiquil to goin' to one's
      duty, to go to ax time or indulgence from his sons. It isn't a clear case
      that you'd get the indulgence, but it is a clear case that you wor sure to
      get a horsewhippin'. Now, you know a horse-whippin' 'ud make a man repint
      goin' to him, an' when a man's in a repintin' state, he may as well repint
      for whatever sins he has committed, while his hand's in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Altogether, thin, my lard an' gintlemin o' the jury, I think it's clear
      that Purcel an' his sons is a great benefit to the counthry about us, an'
      that they ought to be acquitted, especially as it's likely that they have
      more processes to sarve, more auctions to hould an' may be, more widow's
      sons to take on the hands of their poor strugglin' motherss the crathurs,
      that's badly able to support them; and anyhow, nobody can blame a man'll
      that opens the gates of heaven for his fellow creature's sowl, and sends
      him there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope, my lard an' gintlemen, that I has now done my duty in defendin'
      the Purcels and that I've proved to your satisfaction that they ought to
      be acquitted."
    </p>
    <p>
      This harangue of Hourigan's was received with singular alternations of
      fierce rage, and mirth that was still fiercer and more frightful. At the
      conclusion of it there was a loud stamping of feet, accompanied by an
      exulting uproar of approbation. Silence, however, being called, the jurors
      put their heads together across the table, and in less than two minutes
      their foreman handed up the issue paper to a person who acted as register
      and secretary to the meeting. On receipt of this, that worthy functionary,
      in a solemn, deep, and barely audible voice, read a verdict of "guilty,"
      which was received in solemn silence by the assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge then rose, and in a voice that was also solemn but distinct,
      pronounced the sentence of the court to be&mdash;"Death and dark
      destruction to Matthew Purcel and his sons," with an order that it should
      be carried into execution on that very night. The judge then addressed
      them at some length, pretty closely to the following effect:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, my friends," said he, "there is no man in this building who has not
      before now been engaged in affairs of danger and of death. Every one of
      you is the leader of a party of determined fellows, who fear nothing. Our
      business is&mdash;to susteen the oppressed, to crush tyrants, and to right
      those who have been wronged. I am not sorry that the person in command
      over me is absent to-night, for I look upon the office I hold, and the
      exploit we are engaged on, as a high honor. If that person, however, is
      not with us he is engeeged for us, and will send us a strong reinforcement
      in the course of the night. I don't expect that the attack on Purcel's
      house will deteen us long, and after that we have other visits to meek,
      and several fields of pasture to dig up. You all know who I mane when I
      mention the man that has authority over us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We do," replied the crowd; "three cheers for <i>him!</i>" This was
      accordingly responded to, and the speaker proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are to understand," said he, "that Purcel and his two sons are this
      night to die, and their house and pleece to be reduced to ashes. There is
      one thing, however, that I must strongly impress upon you&mdash;remember
      that you are not to injure any of the faymales of the family in the
      slightest degree. The second daughter must be taken and brought to a
      mounted guard that will be ready behind the garden-hedge, to bear her off
      to the mountains&mdash;they know themselves where. I will overteek them,
      or perhaps be there by the upper road before them. If any of you has a
      fancy for the other sister, I'm not the man that will stand in your way;
      but in order to encourage you to do your dooty, I now decleer that it is
      the man who will best distinguish himself among you that must get her. You
      all know what you are to do. The old tyrant, root and branches, is to be
      cut off, and his second daughter secured to me. You have been told the
      password for the night, and if you find any men among you that knows it
      not, put him instantly to death as a spy and a traitor. And now, my brave
      fellows, every man to his post, and I, who am for this night at least'
      your commander, will lead you on. Come, then, follow me, and again I say&mdash;'Death
      and dark destruction to Matthew Purcel and his two sons!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes the vast multitude was in motion, all dressed in white
      shirts and disguised by blackened faces. The were certainly a fierce and
      formidable body, amounting, it is calculated, to not less than five
      thousand men, collected, as it was well known, from the seven adjoining
      counties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aspect of the sky, on this awful night, was long remembered by the
      inhabitants of that part of the country. Over towards the west, and away
      as far as the south, it seemed! to be one long mass of deep, angry-looking
      fire, that seemed both frightful and portentous, and made the spectator
      feel as if a general and immediate conflagration of the heavens was about
      to take place: whilst stretched nearer in point of space to the eye, were
      visible large bars of cloud that seemed, from their crimson color, to be
      masses of actual blood. In fact, the whole firmament was full of gloom and
      terror, and pregnant with such an appalling spirit of coming storm as
      apparently to threaten the destruction of the elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite evident, from the disturbed and unsettled appearance of the
      country for miles around, and from the circumstance of such an unusual
      multitude being on foot in the course of the evening, that some deed of
      more than ordinary importance or danger was to be done. The Purcel's, ever
      on the watch, soon learned that they were to be attacked on that very
      night by those who had threatened them so often, and to whom they
      themselves had so frequently sent back a stern and fierce defiance. Little
      had they calculated, however, that the onset would be made by men so well
      armed and in such prodigious multitudes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the state of society at that period, that scarcely any one
      individual could place confidence in another. The Purcels, knowing that
      they were looked upon by the people in a hostile spirit, and aware of the
      disguises which those secret confederacies, that are so peculiar to our
      unfortunate country, often take for treacherous and vindictive purposes,
      came to the resolution of putting every servant in the house, male and
      female, from off the premises. This they did on discovering Mogue Moylan's
      treachery with respect to the fire-arms; for, in point of fact, they knew
      not on whom to depend. M'Carthy's disappearance was also a mystery which
      occasioned them considerable anxiety and doubt. That he should have
      abandoned them in the very moment of danger, was a circumstance quite out
      of their calculation. On the other hand, it was obvious that he had done
      so, and that from whatever motive his conduct proceeded, he distinctly
      separated himself from them, at the very crisis when his presence and
      assistance might have been of service.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime they began to make preparations for their defence.
      Purcel's dwelling-house was a long, two-storied building, deeply thatched.
      He himself and his eldest son carried up a large supply of arms and
      ammunition to the top room, where they took their station so as to command
      the large gate of the recently-built fortress wall, by which the house and
      adjoining premises were surrounded. Alick, his mother and sisters,
      remained below, in such a position that they could command the gate also,
      without exposing themselves to danger. The mother and daughters had been
      well trained to load and even to discharge fire-arms; and now they were
      both competent and willing to take an important part in defense of their
      own lives, as well as those who were so dear to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said John Purcel, when every necessary preparation had been made,
      "I never could, have dreamt that Frank M'Carthy was either a coward or a
      traitor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I very much fear," replied his brother, "that he is either the one or the
      other, if not both. If he has got a hint&mdash;ha!&mdash;do you hear that
      again?&mdash;they are firing still as they come along&mdash;if he has got
      a hint of this attack and abandoned us, I have not words to express my
      contempt for him. What a bravo lover you have got, Julia!" he exclaimed,
      turning to his sister, "thus to desert you in the hour of danger."
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia made no immediate reply, but, after wiping away some bitter tears,
      she at length said, "I will not believe it&mdash;it cannot be possible: I
      know it is very strange and unaccountable, and I certainly cannot
      understand it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you imagine it possible that M'Carthy could belong to this
      confederation of blood?" asked Alick; "I at least have been told so much:
      however, perhaps time will tell us more about it. For my part&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He had nearly pronounced the words, when a heavy trampling of feet, joined
      to a deep murmur of suppressed voices, was heard; a horn was then sounded,
      and, in about half a minute afterwards, Purcel and his sons were called
      upon to surrender and admit the assailants. From the moment the first
      shots were heard, on the part of the approaching enemy, the Purcels
      concealed all their lights, so that, when the former reached the outer
      wall, the house seemed wrapped in obscurity&mdash;as if the family were
      buried in sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      They now assailed the gate, but soon found that there was little
      likelihood of forcing an entrance without heavier implements than those
      they had in their possession. On ascertaining that this was not
      practicable, they began to fire at the roof of the dwelling-house, and at
      those of the out-offices, with the hope that some portion of the wadding,
      when lighted, might ignite them. In this, after repeated attempts and
      failures, they were ultimately successful. A cow-house that stood detached
      from the other buildings, and, in point of proximity, nearest the gate, at
      length caught the flame, and in a few minutes began to burn. This, to be
      sure, might have been of little consequence to the insurgents, Were it not
      that the wind, which was gusty and blew sometimes with a good deal of
      strength, now and then swept the blaze over to the other offices, which
      were, consequently, soon in flames; and it was now obvious that the
      dwelling-house, from its position and the direction of the blast, could
      not possibly escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto, there was no appearance of either light or life in the proctor's
      dwelling, and the insurgents were by no means satisfied with the progress
      they had made. It is true, they felt confident that none of the Purcels
      had escaped since they approached the house&mdash;a circumstance which was
      impossible, in consequence of the cordon of the enemy that had been drawn
      around the outer wall. Another surmise, however, maddened them almost to
      fury. Could it be possible that the objects of their hatred had abandoned
      the house in the earlier part of the night, and thus defrauded them of
      their vengeance? The thought was intolerable; but that was a point which
      they would now be in a capacity soon to ascertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding that the gate, as we said, was impregnable, unless with stronger
      implements, they had sent to a smith's forge in the neighborhood, from
      whence they obtained two or three sledge-hammers. By the aid of these they
      soon shivered the gate to pieces, and, having accomplished this, they&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we proceed further, it is necessary to state, that the light of the
      burning cow-house fell upon them with the strength and clearness of a
      summer noon; whilst, on the other hand, the proctor's family, from the
      position of the house, were in complete obscurity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The advantage was, consequently, all on one side; the Purcels, when the
      gate was demolished, saw the crowd clearly and distinctly, but the crowd
      could not at all see them. Feather-beds and other defenses had been placed
      at the windows, in such a manner that the firing from the house could be
      delivered with almost perfect impunity to the inmates, but with dreadful
      and deadly effect upon the assailants. The latter, having accomplished the
      destruction of the gate, were in the act of entering, when, all at once,
      such a well-directed volley was poured among them as caused every man of
      the front ranks to fall dead. Four blunderbusses had been discharged among
      them&mdash;three by the proctor and his two sons, and one by his eldest
      daughter Mary. The fatal effect with which this fire was delivered caused
      a momentary pause, and the aggressive crowd was forced to rush back in a
      kind of wavy motion, that resembled the undulations of a retreating
      serpent. An immediate return, however, took place; and, in about half a
      minute, those in front, however reluctant, were forced forward by the
      pressure from without. Again did a well-directed fire bring down those who
      were thrust forward, and the consequence was that a back action took
      place, which enabled those in front to retire for the present from what
      they clearly saw was certain death.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far the proctor's family were triumphant, and would have been so, were
      it not for the conflagration of the offices, which every moment threatened
      their own house with destruction. There was not now one among the crowd
      hardy enough to attempt an entrance by the open gate-which entrance they
      knew to be only another name for death. Two circumstances, however, were
      at work against the brave and intrepid proctor and his equally brave and
      intrepid sons. Crowbars had been procured, and three breaches were being
      made in those parts of the wall which the windows of the house did not
      command, and what was still equally, if not more dreadful to the besieged,
      was the fact of the dwelling-house having taken fire, from the flames that
      were wafted to it by the conflagration of the adjoining offices. The
      breaches having been effected, the assailants precipitated themselves into
      the yard; and now commenced the work of destruction in reality. The latter
      were shot down in scores; whilst at the same time, the windows of the
      house from which this destructive fire was kept up so ably, received fifty
      discharges to one that had been made from them. The house was immediately
      surrounded, and guards were placed at the doors and lower windows, with
      strict and fatal orders to allow none of the family to escape, with the
      exception of the females&mdash;one of whom was to be secured, as the
      reader knows, for a particular purpose, and the rest as chance or passion
      might direct.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Purcels, in the meantime, ably served and assisted by Mrs. Purcel and
      her daughters, continued to deal death and destruction on the parties
      outside, without being yet either fatigued or disabled. At length the
      terrible light of the roof that was burning over them, and the stifling
      heat which began to oppress them, startled the proctor into a state of
      feeling so awful, that it obliterated from his awakened conscience all
      external impressions of the dreadful havoc of human life which was taking
      place about him. The feeling was deepened by a discovery that the gate had
      been broken and breaches made in the walls, as well as by the incredible
      multitude of armed persons about the premises, most of whom were now
      distinctly visible by the glare of the conflagration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The life of Matthew Purcel, though unstained by any of those gross crimes
      which separate man from his fellows, or draw down the punishment of the
      law upon those who commit them, was, nevertheless, in a singular degree,
      unfeeling, oppressive, and rapacious. Though plausible and clever in his
      manner, and anxious to stand well with the world, he was, at the same
      time, relentless and implacable, a tyrant within the petty sphere of his
      influence, a despiser of all those principles that were not calculated, no
      matter how, to elevate and enrich. He ground the poor, and wrung, by the
      most oppressive extortion, out of their sweat and labor, all and much more
      than they could afford to give him. With destitution and poverty in their
      most touching and pitiable shapes, he never had one moment's sympathy, nor
      did the widow or orphan ever experience a single act of benevolence or
      mercy at his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was now a short pause in the work of destruction, but it was evident
      to him and his family that some new element of action was at work among
      the multitude, though of its character and object they could form no
      possible conjecture. The Purcels had now a short space for reflection, and
      but a short one, for they all felt, by the increasing heat that proceeded
      from the burning roof, that they could not long abide under it. Alick and
      the females had joined John and his father in the top room, and the latter
      now saw clearly that fate, in its most dreadful and appalling shape, was
      on him and his whole family, for it was clear, as matters stood, that
      neither he nor his sons, at all events, could escape the vengeance of the
      infuriated multitude. In this condition, his veins swollen, and the
      perspiration standing in large beads upon his forehead, he took one
      fearful and agonizing glance upon his past life, and felt, now that he
      stood on the verge of eternity, that the retrospect was like a glimpse of
      hell. The change that came over his features was frightful beyond all
      belief; his face became nearly black, and his eyes, which grew bloodshot
      almost in a few minutes, had, notwithstanding, a sharp delirious
      expression of terror that no language could depict.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great God! father," exclaimed his son John, who first noticed, this
      change in his appearance, "what is the matter with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are lost!" he exclaimed; "oh, my past life! Great Heaven! if I had but
      one act of kindness to look back upon, I could dare death. Children, the
      tortures of hell are upon me! Here is death at my throat, but how will I
      die? Hallo&mdash;look!" he exclaimed, "do you see it?&mdash;it is all
      black&mdash;black and bloody&mdash;black and bloody&mdash;that life of
      mine! Crimes&mdash;crimes&mdash;crimes against the poor&mdash;against the
      widow and the orphan! Why did I do it? Eh, why did I oppress, and grind,
      and murder! Ay, murder!&mdash;where's Widow Flanagan's son?&mdash;where's
      all the blood I was the means of shedding?&mdash;where are the rotten
      corpses that are now festering in the grave, because I was rapacious and
      an oppressor? Hallo! I say, don't curse me&mdash;or rather, do curse me&mdash;damn
      me&mdash;damn my soul&mdash;damn my soul&mdash;ha! what am I saying?&mdash;who
      brought me to this? Who? why who but the black and damnable parsons&mdash;ay,
      the parsons and their d&mdash;d heretical church! However, I'll have my
      revenge, for hell is lined with them&mdash;paved with them&mdash;circled
      with them; and there I'll find them in burning squads to welcome me&mdash;ha!
      ha! ha! Welcome, Proctor! Tithe-Proctor! God's Perdition! what a name!
      what a character? Tithe-Proctor!&mdash;that is rogue, oppressor, scourge,
      murderer!&mdash;and all for what? For a dead, lazy, gross, overgrown
      heresy! Ay, lazy parsons that I brought myself to this for, to perdition
      for! But then I was proud too&mdash;oh, it was a great thing to creep up
      from poverty and cunning to broadcloth and top-boots, to saddle horse,
      then a jaunting-car, to shake hands with the great parsons, who despised
      me all the while and made me their tool and scapegoat! Oh, yes, and to
      have my sons able to hunt in red coats and top-boots, and my daughters to
      ride on side-saddles&mdash;how do you do, gintlemen?&mdash;ladies, your
      most obedient! but, where are we?&mdash;what is this? Is this the light of
      hell, and these the devils with their black faces? And yet, I did intend
      to repent and to be merciful to the poor; and now here comes damnation!
      and why? have I not murdered you all?&mdash;where am I?&mdash;who am I? I
      am not Matthew Purcel, the Tithe-Proctor, I hope&mdash;make that clear,
      and I'll give you&mdash;or could it be a dream?&mdash;no, no, it is real,
      a real fact; and the gulf of damnation yawns for me! Ha!&mdash;well&mdash;come,
      then, let us die like men; give me the blunderbuss; now, down with the
      villains&mdash;down with the villains!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His family had been standing between the shelter of two windows, almost
      transfixed into stone with horror at the blasphemous agonies under which
      his frantic spirit was raging and writhing. The truth is, that the
      frightful certainty of death to himself and his family, in such an
      unprepared state, together with the rapid glance of his ill-spent life,
      joined to his exertion and the suffocating heat of the room, had, all
      combined, induced what may be well termed this insane paroxysm of despair
      and guilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      On seizing the blunderbuss, he rushed, now distinctly visible in the
      light, and forgetful that the multitude were on the watch for him, over
      towards one of the unprotected windows, where he was followed by his son
      John, for the purpose of being dragged out of danger. He had just
      discharged the blunderbuss at their leader, who was on the point of making
      his way to the hall-door, when the ruffian fell stone-dead, and almost
      simultaneously, he and his son John were literally perforated with a
      shower of bullets.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must die, also," exclaimed Alick to his mother and his sisters; "we
      must die,&mdash;but let us die firmly. Any death, however, is better than
      one of fire; here we cannot stay longer. Stoop now, so that we may pass
      that part of the wall that is beneath the windows, until we reach the
      lower floor; if we expose ourselves only for a moment, we must share their
      fate. Great God! what a fate and what a night!"
    </p>
    <p>
      By following his advice, they reached the lower floor in safety, and had
      scarcely done so, when the burning roof crashed in upon the bodies of the
      proctor and his son, of whose remains nothing but a few cinders were found
      the next morning. The falling in of the roof was accompanied by a
      considerable explosion, owing to the powder which they had left behind
      them, and the noise of which caused the crowd that was now hemming in the
      house to pause for a moment, but only for a moment; for they knew now by
      the explosion, that the ammunition of their enemies was gone, and that
      "the old fox and his cubs," as they called them, were probably incapable
      of further resistance; a reflection which, as it stood not in the way of
      their cowardice, seemed to increase their fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Revenge now, boys," shouted a hundred voices; "they have shot our leader
      along with the rest. Come on then, sledge in the doors an' windies, an' if
      we lave a single inch of the villains together, may we be hanged like
      dogs! Come on, then, they are helpless now; their ammunition's gone, an'
      they can do us no harm. Blood for blood as far as they go; it's into
      inches we must hew them&mdash;into inches&mdash;come on, then!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A furious assault instantly commenced at the doors and windows. It was,
      indeed, a frightful thing to see these men, with their white shirts and
      black visages, fiercely at work; panting and inflamed with ungovernable
      rage and vengeance, the red turbid blaze of the burning building lighting
      them into the similitude of incarnate devils, let loose upon some hellish
      mission of destruction and blood. Their own fury, however, impeded their
      progress, for as they passed onwards to the door, urged by the worst
      passions of man, it was found that their violence, thus broken and
      diminished by the struggle, had prevented them from making anything like a
      rapid progress in breaking in the powerfully-fortified door. There was
      consequently another slight pause, during which a circumstance occurred
      that added a terrible sublimity to the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have said, that the sky looked angry and portentous, and such was the
      fact. During the pauses that now occurred, the distant darkness of the
      surrounding country was momentarily dispelled by a stronger and more
      terrific fire than that which now shot up its red and waving pyramids from
      the burning houses before them. All at once the black sky opened, and from
      the chasm of angry clouds a sheet of red lightning flashed, lighting up
      the darkness of the country around them in a fearful manner; but above all
      things, and what gave a super-added horror to the scene, was the influence
      which that light, that seemed to proceed from the vengeance of God, had
      upon that which proceeded from the vengeance of man. The sheeted volume
      swept down, and for an instant poured over the blazing roofs, the
      tottering walls, the bleeding corpses and the black-visaged men who stood
      in multitudes about the place, panting with the mad intoxication of crime;
      it poured upon them, we say, a light so strong, penetrating, and intense,
      that its fearful distinctness was enough to paralyze the heart, and awe
      those who were present from the prosecution of their vengeance. It was, in
      fact, as if the Almighty Himself had sent down His avenging angel from the
      heavens, to pour His light upon them, in order to bear testimony against
      the dreadful work of blood in which they were engaged. Nor was this all.
      Ere the pause was broken, a burst of thunder, so deep, so loud, and so
      terrible, in such an hour, pealed from a point of the sky on their right,
      taking its course in the direction of the proctor's house, where, in one
      terrific explosion, it seemed to burst exactly over their heads. Some were
      awed, but we all know that companionship fortifies the heart in the
      commission of crime, and in a few minutes the Almighty, His fires of
      vengeance,&mdash;and His midnight thunders, were all alike forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assault on the door was now renewed with, if possible, more ferocious
      violence; and it became evident to the unfortunate and now helpless
      inmates, that they must soon fall into the hands of those from whom they
      could expect no mercy. We say they were in a helpless state; and this was
      occasioned by the explosion, which left them without ammunition, even if
      they had had their firearms. Such, however, was their hurry in escaping
      from the falling roof, joined to the shock and stupor caused by the death
      of John and his father, that they thought not for a moment of anything but
      mere self-preservation. Owing to these causes they brought no weapons of
      defence with them; and now, in consequence of the fallen roof and
      explosion, their fire-arms were beyond their reach, and useless. They
      stood now ghastly&mdash;their features rigid like those of the dead&mdash;calm
      and without a tremor&mdash;but with a melancholy fortitude that was as
      noble as it was rare and unprecedented. At length Mrs. Purcel spoke:&mdash;"Alick,"
      said she, "you must save yourself: we may receive some mercy at the hands
      of these men, but you will not; hide yourself somewhere, and, when they
      come in, we will say that you perished with your father and brother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear mother," replied her son, "while I have life I will not
      separate from' you and these dear girls."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is madness," observed Julia; "what can you expect? Have we not
      witnessed bloodshed enough to-night already?&mdash;or are you determined
      that we shall be compelled to witness your murder before our faces? Oh,
      dear Alick, be advised by my mother; by secreting yourself, you may
      escape; but if you are found here, you will be instantly shot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Alick," said Mary, "by the love you bear us, and by the blood of
      those whom these murdering ruffians have sacrificed, we implore and
      entreat you to conceal yourself; and, if that fails&mdash;then, by the
      love of God, do as we desire!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had scarcely uttered the last words, when a single Whiteboy, with
      blackened face, made his appearance at the end of the kitchen stairs, and
      approached them, waving his hands with a mingled expression of distraction
      and entreaty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear John," he exclaimed, "be patient; and Julia, be calm, and hear me. I
      am," he added, in a low and guarded whisper, "Frank M'Carthy: as you hope
      for mercy from God and life from man, listen! The door will be broken in
      in a few minutes; but if you are guided by me, you may yet be safe.
      Blacken your face forthwith, Alick; and here is a shirt marked with blood
      too&mdash;a circumstance that will give you more security&mdash;which I
      have brought you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Frank M'Carthy," exclaimed Julia, "and a Whiteboy! Oh, yes, be advised by
      him, Alick; as for me, I care not how soon death comes&mdash;I have little
      to live for now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If there was time, dear Julia, for explanation, I could soon satisfy you;
      but, alas! I fear to ask for your father and John."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are both murdered, sir," she replied; "they have fallen victims to
      men who are in the habit of wearing white shirts and black faces&mdash;with,
      I fear, blacker hearts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great God!" he exclaimed, "is this so? but time now is life: I must bear
      your suspicions, Julia, until a fitter occasion. You, Alick, as you will
      not and wish not to leave your mother and sisters unprotected, follow me&mdash;follow
      me, or, as I hope for God's mercy, you are lost, and your sisters&mdash;I
      dread to think of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is enough," said Alick, struck now with absolute impatience: "I
      consent, Frank&mdash;what do you wish?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He brought him at once to the kitchen, where he took soot from the
      chimney, which he moistened with water, and, in a couple of minutes,
      blackened his face and put the bloody shirt over his dress. The change was
      so completely and quickly effected, that the females for a moment took it
      for granted that they were strangers who had forced an entrance by some
      other way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," said M'Carthy, placing a loaded pistol in Alick's hand, "the
      pass-word for the night is '<i>the Cannie Soogah</i>'&mdash;you won't
      forget that?&mdash;but, above all things, don't think of using your
      pistol, whatever may happen, until you hear me shout, '<i>the Cannie
      Soogah to the rescue!</i>' and even then, wait until you see and speak to
      him&mdash;the brave, the noble, the glorious fellow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good God! and is he here?" asked Alick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's here&mdash;he's everywhere," replied the other: "he's here, at all
      events, before now, I hope: the manner in which I shall call upon his name
      is this&mdash;first, I shout 'the Cannie Soogah!' the very mention of
      which will be followed by a general cheer; then, when he appears, I shall
      call out, 'the Cannie Soogah to the rescue!' After this you must be guided
      by me, as I must be by the Cannie Soogah and circumstances. Come, now, it
      is safer to open the door and admit these ruffians."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And remember," added Alick, turning with a look of agony to the females,
      "that the men have all been shot, and are lying in the upper room!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The ruse of M'Carthy succeeded. The Whiteboys, on being admitted, took it
      for granted that those who opened the door belonged to themselves and had
      got in by some other entrance. The house was hastily searched; and the
      fact of the Purcels having been killed in the upper room, was corroborated
      by the limbs of John and his father being visible among the burning pile.
      The state of the house now rendered a hasty retreat out of it necessary. A
      sudden trembling of the walls and upper joists was felt, the crowd rushed
      out, and the next moment the whole building was one fallen mass of smoking
      ruins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The females now found themselves prisoners; but still their brother and
      M'Carthy kept near them, and seemed to act as a portion of those to whom
      their guardianship! had been entrusted. Julia found herself committed, as
      if by general consent, to the care of one individual, who kept her a
      little in advance of the accompanying crowd&mdash;to! whom, from time to
      time, he waved his hand without looking behind him to intimate that they
      should not press close upon them, but afford him an opportunity of holding
      what he wished to be considered some confidential conversation with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I may be blest, Miss Julia, but you're a lucky girl this night&mdash;an'
      I think I may say that I'm a lucky boy myself. I'm to take care of you,
      and to bring you to a safe place; which I'll do, never fear. You know what
      I told you afore about my family&mdash;how we wor ever an' always doin'
      our best against the Sassanach Laws&mdash;an ould family it is&mdash;an'
      sure ould blood is betther than riches any day&mdash;an' it isn't
      complexion aither, Miss Julia, that a&mdash;this way, darlin'&mdash;this
      way&mdash;an' how long now is it since you fell in consate with me? Well,
      darlin' that I may die a happy death in a good ould age, if I can blame
      you for not spakin'&mdash;especially afther havin' lost your father and
      two brothers this night. Howandiver, we can have a lob of their wealth,
      anyhow, yourself and myself&mdash;this way, darlin', there's a party of
      friends waitin' for us&mdash;wisha' thin, but I'm lookin' forrid to a
      happy life wid you&mdash;but sure you might say a single word to me,
      darlin'&mdash;jist to let me know you hear me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether Julia heard this one-sided dialogue or not, it is difficult to
      say. She seemed passive and inattentive, and walked on with an abstracted
      and mechanical motion. Her brother and lover could only get near her
      occasionally, having found it necessary to watch her mother and sister
      also. They could perceive, however, not only that the crowd which followed
      Mogue appeared to be a good deal in his confidence, and under his sway,
      but that it increased so rapidly as he went along, that they became
      alarmed, especially as the Cannie Soogah had not yet made his appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment they were met by a body of men, who on looking at Mogue and
      Julia, exclaimed, "You are bringing her the wrong way&mdash;you are
      breakin' your ordhers&mdash;you know that our captain laid it out, that
      you should bring her in the other direction, and to where the guard is
      waitin' for her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay," replied Mogue, "but you know our captain had been shot, and is lyin'
      stiff inside the gate there behind us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But livin' or dead," they replied, "do you observe your duty&mdash;it's a
      bad an' dangerous example you're settin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But sure if the captain was alive," said Mogue, "it 'ud be a different
      thing&mdash;that I may be happy, but I'm bringin' her the right way, and
      to the right place, too&mdash;amn't I, boys?" he exclaimed, turning to his
      followers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All's right!" they replied; "to be sure you are&mdash;go on, and more
      powers!"
    </p>
    <p>
      About a minute or two before this, a mounted Whitefoot had rode up, and
      having heard the words, he replied to Mogue, in a loud voice, "No, sir!
      our captain is not shot, but is safe and sound." And scarcely had the
      words proceeded from his lips when the very individual, as it seemed, who
      had led them during the night, galloped up to the place of altercation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who says I am dead," said he; "I don't look like a dead man, I think.
      Meek way there till I speak to this man," pointing to Mogue. "Why, sir,
      did you dare to disobey ordhers by taking this lady to the wrong place?
      Answer me that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mogue, seeing that his support was now powerful, looked at them, and asked
      aloud&mdash;"Am I bringin' the lady the wrong way, boys?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," they replied; "Go on, and more power!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment M'Carthy shouted out in loud and powerful tones&mdash;"The
      Cannie Soogah!" and the words were no sooner uttered than Mogue started, a
      rapid stir and murmur pervaded, the multitude, and almost instantly a most
      hearty and vociferous cheer awakened the echoes that slept among the
      neighboring hills. The moment this had subsided, the same voice repeated
      the name with an addition&mdash;"The Cannie Soogah to the rescue&mdash;here
      he is!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Our facetious friend, for it was he, threw up his hand in a peculiar
      manner, that made the act understood by all present, with the exception of
      M'Carthy and Alick Purcel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, boys," he exclaimed, "I am here; and I thank you for your kindness.
      You have had a full revenge to-night on Purcel and his family; but, as I
      have been a long time in search of a good wife, I suppose you have no
      objection that I should take charge of the ladies."
    </p>
    <p>
      These words were followed by another astounding cheer, and the Cannie,
      riding over to the spot where Mrs. Purcel and her daughter stood&mdash;for
      she and Mary had now joined Julia&mdash;was about to speak to them, when
      the report of a pistol was heard, and at the same moment a bullet whizzed
      past his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Treachery!" he shouted, "treachery against your commander! Seize upon
      that person, in the name of Captain Right."
    </p>
    <p>
      His words came late; another report followed the first, with an interval
      of less than a quarter of a minute between them, and instantly our pious
      friend, who had flattered himself with the prospect of a long and happy
      life in the possession of Julia Purcel, fell stone-dead to the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" shouted the Cannie, "is this more treachery? But wait, I'll soon
      cure this."
    </p>
    <p>
      He put a horn to his lips as he spoke, and having given it a sharp, quick,
      and hasty blast, he nodded his head, as much as to say, "Wait a moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The last shot wasn't threachery anyhow," exclaimed Jerry Joyce, whose
      voice Alick immediately recognized; "somebody," he added, with a
      significant look, "has ped honest Mogue for his."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he dead?" asked the Cannie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is dead, captain," replied several, "and so may every one die that's a
      traitor to the Cannie Soogah&mdash;our bold Captain Right.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      A body of about a thousand men now made their appearance, every one of
      them personally devoted to the Cannie Soogah; and brought there for the
      humane purpose, if possible, of saving Purcel and his sons that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was a false alarm, my friends," said he, as they came up; "there was
      only one traitor among them, and he has been brought to his account. I
      didn't wish for his death, and he might have got some other punishment,
      but it can't be helped now; I'm only sorry for the false-hearted vagabond
      because he wasn't fit to die."
    </p>
    <p>
      He then, after a few words of advice, dismissed them to their respective
      homes, with the exception of a certain number of faithful followers, whom
      he retained for the purpose of assisting him to escort Mrs. Purcel and her
      daughters to the house of our worthy magistrate. Another body he also
      appointed to the task of carrying the dead and wounded away to some remote

      Our narrative, we may say, is closed. The Cannie now having placed Mrs.
      Purcel and her daughters on horseback, directed his friends to proceed to
      the residence of the redoubtable Fitzy O'Driscol, who was by no means
      prepared for seeing such a number of Whiteboys about his house. Alick
      Purcel and M'Carthy also got horses, and as they went along, M'Carthy
      received from him a solution to the mysterious occurrences in which he had
      been involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Purcel's family," said he, but not in hearing of the females, "is the
      last family that I ought to protect this night. They have shot my twin
      brother, the man that went by the name of Buck English. He is now gone to
      his reckonin' and may God forgive him! He was tried and found guilty of
      murdher in the county of Cork, and the worst of it was that it was in the
      act of robbin' a gentleman's house that the murdher was committed. While
      he was in gaol I contrived to get into him, and we managed so well that he
      escaped, and I was kept in his place. The next day I tould them the truth,
      and he was taken again; but it seems that the gintleman that prosecuted,
      on hearin' that there was another person so like him, felt unaisy in his
      mind and got him off for the murdher, in dread he might have sworn against
      the wrong man. He couldn't keep himself quiet though, for, on the very day
      before his pardon came, he was caught, along wid some others, in the act
      of breakin' out of the gaol, and for that he got a severe wound and seven
      years' transportation. All our lives, I and my other brother&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, have you another brother, Cannie?" asked M'Carthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Troth, and I have; and you may thank God that I have, or it isn't here
      but in heaven, I hope, you'd be this night. Well, as I was sayin', I an'
      my other brother spent our whole life in tryin' to defate him in his plans
      and skames&mdash;may God forgive him! We often did, but not always; for
      sometimes he was too many for both of us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Cannie, about the night I was in Frank Finnerty's, who was it that
      saved my life twice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of them&mdash;he that wounded the fellows&mdash;I don't wish to name&mdash;but,
      indeed I'm crippled here, bekaise you know, gintlemen, that there are laws
      in the land. A friend to your family met Mogue Moylan, and, suspectin'
      what was in the wind, sent that friend to assist you, and it was by
      volunteerin' to take your life that he was able to save you. My brother,
      afther meetin' him, and hearin' from him what happened was the man that
      met you aftherwards, that gave you the passwords, and showed you how to
      open the windey. There were others there that knew you, for I hope you
      don't think that every man goin' out at night wid a white shirt and a
      black face on him is a murdherer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God forbid!" said M'Carthy, "I've been disguised by both myself, as it
      happens. It is difficult, however, for any country to be happy, or any
      people either industrious or moral, when such secret confederacies are
      made the standard of both law and morality."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's thruth, Mr. M'Carthy, and no man knows it betther than I do; I and
      my brother&mdash;not him that's gone to his account to night, but the
      other&mdash;were forced to join them for our own safety, but, as long as
      we wor of them, we endeavored to do as much good&mdash;that is, to prevent
      as much evil&mdash;as we could. It was I that sent you, Mr. M'Carthy, the
      letter to Dublin, and it was I that sent the messenger for you this
      evenin'; I took it for granted that if you had remained in Mr. Purcel's
      you'd been shot, and, besides, I wanted you to watch Mogue Moylan, for I
      had raison to know that he intended to play a trick on me to night in
      regard to Miss Julia. I had my doubts all along whether I could come in
      time to save the whole family and defate my brother, and I could not, for
      I had an immense number of my own men to get together; however, God's will
      be done; I did all that lay in my power."
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching Nassau Lodge, the party anticipated some danger from Fergus
      O'Driscol's fire-arms. Alick, however, knocked, and on hearing the window
      open, exclaimed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be alarmed, Fergus, we are friends. My mother and sisters are here,
      and wish to get in. This has been a dreadful night!&mdash;a night of
      bloodshed and murder!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My God!" exclaimed Fergus, "what is this you tell me? But why, Alick, are
      you surrounded by such a number of Whiteboys. I can see distinctly that
      they are such by the light of the moon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Boys," said the Cannie Soogah, "disperse now&mdash;and thank you; I feel
      your kindness, and I won't forget it&mdash;you see the people of the house
      are alarmed&mdash;but that's not the worst of it&mdash;what," he added,
      with a peculiar smile, "if you bring that terrible dare-divil, O'Driscol,
      upon you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd immediately dispersed, and in a few minutes the melancholy group
      were admitted to the welcome shelter of the magistrate's hospitable roof;
      for such, in fact, it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not intend to dwell upon this melancholy meeting of the neighboring
      families, nor upon the heart-rending details which were given of the
      dreadful circumstances that made that night so hideous. All the O'Driscols
      were present, and deeply participated in the affliction of the late
      proctor's family with the exception of the magistrate himself, who, much
      to their astonishment, was not forthcoming. Every successive moment,
      however, he was looked for; but as he did not, after an unusual period of
      expectation, make his appearance, some alarm began to be felt, which
      gradually increased, especially on the part of his daughter, until she
      proposed that a search should be made for him. This was accordingly done,
      when&mdash;but let it not reach the ears of his friend the Castle, he was
      discovered somewhat in the position of Philosopher Square, behind Molly
      Seagrim's curtain, squatted upon his hunkers, as they say, in the furthest
      and darkest corner of the coal hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      In about half an hour after this discovery, a knock came to the door, and
      it was intimated to Alick Purcel and M'Carthy, that the Cannie Soogah
      wished to see them for a minute or two,&mdash;but that he declined coming
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen," said he, when they came to the hall-door, "I have made up my
      mind since I left you awhile ago, and I'm come to bid you both farewell.
      This at present is not a paceful country to live in, and I'm tired of the
      work that's goin' on in it. I'm now come to bid you both farewell, and my
      brother is goin' along wid me. The other will be laid in his grave this
      night. I wish, Mr. Purcel, I could a' done more for your family; but
      what's done can't be undone. Farewell, then," said he, and, as he spoke,
      his voice was filled with deep but manly emotion&mdash;"Farewell to you
      both! When you think of me, let it be kindly, for from this night out you
      will never see the Cannie Soogah more."
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his two hands upon his face, gave a sob or two, and immediately
      departed at a rapid pace, and never was seen in the country afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is necessary to say now that Alick Purcel and his beloved Miss
      O'Driscol were united;&mdash;that M'Carthy, in due time, after having been
      called to the bar, was made happy in the possession of Julia Purcel; and
      that Jerry Joyce, in imitation of his betters, was blessed by the hand and
      honest heart of Letty Lenehan. and honest heart of Letty Lenehan.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
