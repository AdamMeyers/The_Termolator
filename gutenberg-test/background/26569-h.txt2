monkey on his back

Under the cloud of cast-off identities<br
 />lay the shape of another man&mdash;<br
 />was it himself?

Illustrated by DILLON



HE was walking endlessly
down a long, glass-walled
corridor. Bright sunlight
slanted in through one wall, on the
blue knapsack across his shoulders.
Who he was, and what he was doing
here, was clouded. The truth lurked
in some corner of his consciousness,
but it was not reached by surface
awareness.

The corridor opened at last into
a large high-domed room, much
like a railway station or an air terminal.
He walked straight ahead.

At the sight of him a man leaning
negligently against a stone pillar,
to his right but within vision,
straightened and barked an order
to him, &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; He lengthened his
stride but gave no other sign.

[p<span
 class="pgmark">136]<br
 />Two men hurried through a
doorway of a small anteroom to his
left, calling to him. He turned away
and began to run.

Shouts and the sound of charging
feet came from behind him. He
cut to the right, running toward the
escalator to the second floor. Another
pair of men were hurrying
down, two steps at a stride. With
no break in pace he veered into an
opening beside the escalator.

At the first turn he saw that the
aisle merely circled the stairway,
coming out into the depot again on
the other side. It was a trap. He
glanced quickly around him.

At the rear of the space was a
row of lockers for traveler use. He
slipped a coin into a pay slot,
opened the zipper on his bag and
pulled out a flat briefcase. It took
him only a few seconds to push the
case into the compartment, lock it
and slide the key along the floor
beneath the locker.

There was nothing to do after
that&mdash;except wait.

The men pursuing him came
hurtling around the turn in the
aisle. He kicked his knapsack to
one side, spreading his feet wide
with an instinctive motion.

Until that instant he had intended
to fight. Now he swiftly
reassessed the odds. There were
five of them, he saw. He should be
able to incapacitate two or three
and break out. But the fact that
they had been expecting him meant
that others would very probably
be waiting outside. His best course
now was to sham ignorance. He
relaxed.

He offered no resistance as they
reached him.

They were not gentle men. A tall
ruffian, copper-brown face damp
with perspiration and body oil,
grabbed him by the jacket and
slammed him back against the
lockers. As he shifted his weight
to keep his footing someone drove
a fist into his face. He started to
raise his hands; and a hard flat
object crashed against the side of
his skull.

The starch went out of his legs.


&ldquo;DO you make anything out of
it?&rdquo; the psychoanalyst Milton
Bergstrom, asked.

John Zarwell shook his head.
&ldquo;Did I talk while I was under?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Oh, yes. You were supposed to.
That way I follow pretty well what
you&#8217;re reenacting.&rdquo;

&ldquo;How does it tie in with what I
told you before?&rdquo;

Bergstrom&#8217;s neat-boned, fair-skinned
face betrayed no emotion
other than an introspective stillness
of his normally alert gaze. &ldquo;I see
no connection,&rdquo; he decided, his
words once again precise and meticulous.
&ldquo;We don&#8217;t have enough to
go on. Do you feel able to try another
comanalysis this afternoon
yet?&rdquo;

&ldquo;I don&#8217;t see why not.&rdquo; Zarwell
[p<span
 class="pgmark">137]
 opened the collar of his shirt. The
day was hot, and the room had no
air conditioning, still a rare luxury
on St. Martin&#8217;s. The office window
was open, but it let in no freshness,
only the mildly rank odor that pervaded
all the planet&#8217;s habitable
area.

&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; Bergstrom rose. &ldquo;The
serum is quite harmless, John.&rdquo; He
maintained a professional diversionary
chatter as he administered
the drug. &ldquo;A scopolamine derivative
that&#8217;s been well tested.&rdquo;

The floor beneath Zarwell&#8217;s feet
assumed abruptly the near transfluent
consistency of a damp
sponge. It rose in a foot-high wave
and rolled gently toward the far
wall.

Bergstrom continued talking,
with practiced urbanity. &ldquo;When
psychiatry was a less exact science,&rdquo;
his voice went on, seeming to come
from a great distance, &ldquo;a doctor
had to spend weeks, sometimes
months or years interviewing a
patient. If he was skilled enough,
he could sort the relevancies from
the vast amount of chaff. We are
able now, with the help of the
serum, to confine our discourses to
matters cogent to the patient&#8217;s
trouble.&rdquo;

The floor continued its transmutation,
and Zarwell sank deep into
viscous depths. &ldquo;Lie back and relax.
Don&#8217;t&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;

The words tumbled down from
above. They faded, were gone.

ZARWELL found himself 
standing on a vast plain. There was
no sky above, and no horizon in the
distance. He was in a place without
space or dimension. There was
nothing here except himself&mdash;and
the gun that he held in his hand.

A weapon beautiful in its efficient
simplicity.

He should know all about the
instrument, its purpose and workings,
but he could not bring his
thoughts into rational focus. His
forehead creased with his mental
effort.

Abruptly the unreality about
him shifted perspective. He was
approaching&mdash;not walking, but
merely shortening the space between
them&mdash;the man who held
the gun. The man who was himself.
The other &ldquo;himself&rdquo; drifted
nearer also, as though drawn by a
mutual attraction.

The man with the gun raised his
weapon and pressed the trigger.

With the action the perspective
shifted again. He was watching the
face of the man he shot jerk and
twitch, expand and contract. The
face was unharmed, yet it was no
longer the same. No longer his own
features.

The stranger face smiled approvingly
at him.


&ldquo;ODD,&rdquo; Bergstrom said. 
He brought his hands up and joined
the tips of his fingers against his
chest. &ldquo;But it&#8217;s another piece in the
[p<span
 class="pgmark">138]
 jig-saw. In time it will fit into
place.&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;It means no
more to you than the first, I suppose?&rdquo;

&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Zarwell answered.

He was not a talking man, Bergstrom
reflected. It was more than
reticence, however. The man had
a hard granite core, only partially
concealed by his present perplexity.
He was a man who could handle
himself well in an emergency.

Bergstrom shrugged, dismissing
his strayed thoughts. &ldquo;I expected
as much. A quite normal first phase
of treatment.&rdquo; He straightened a
paper on his desk. &ldquo;I think that will
be enough for today. Twice in one
sitting is about all we ever try.
Otherwise some particular episode
might cause undue mental stress,
and set up a block.&rdquo; He glanced
down at his appointment pad. &ldquo;Tomorrow
at two, then?&rdquo;

Zarwell grunted acknowledgment
and pushed himself to his
feet, apparently unaware that his
shirt clung damply to his body.


THE sun was still high when
Zarwell left the analyst&#8217;s office.
The white marble of the city&#8217;s
buildings shimmered in the afternoon
heat, squat and austere as
giant tree trunks, pock-marked and
gray-mottled with windows. Zarwell
was careful not to rest his hand
on the flesh searing surface of the
stone.

The evening meal hour was approaching
when he reached the
Flats, on the way to his apartment.
The streets of the old section were
near-deserted. The only sounds he
heard as he passed were the occasional
cry of a baby, chronically
uncomfortable in the day&#8217;s heat,
and the lowing of imported cattle
waiting in a nearby shed to be
shipped to the country.

All St. Martin&#8217;s has a distinctive
smell, as of an arid dried-out
swamp, with a faint taint of fish.
But in the Flats the odor changes.
Here is the smell of factories, warehouses,
and trading marts; the smell
of stale cooking drifting from the
homes of the laborers and lower
class techmen who live there.

Zarwell passed a group of
smaller children playing a desultory
game of lic-lic for pieces of
candy and cigarettes. Slowly he
climbed the stairs of a stone flat.
He prepared a supper for himself
and ate it without either enjoyment
or distaste. He lay down, fully
clothed, on his bed. The visit to the
analyst had done nothing to dispel
his ennui.

[p<span
 class="pgmark">139]<br
 /><img src="images/illus-139.png" width="498" height="700"
 alt="sketch of faces with clenched fists" title="" />

The next morning when Zarwell
awoke he lay for a moment, unmoving.
The feeling was there
again, like a scene waiting only to
be gazed at directly to be perceived.
It was as though a great wisdom
lay at the edge of understanding.
If he rested quietly it would
all come to him. Yet always, when
his mind lost its sleep-induced
[p<span
 class="pgmark">140]
 lethargy, the moment of near understanding
slipped away.

This morning, however, the sense
of disorientation did not pass with
full wakefulness. He achieved no
understanding, but the strangeness
did not leave as he sat up.

He gazed about him. The room
did not seem to be his own. The
furnishings, and the clothing he observed
in a closet, might have belonged
to a stranger.

He pulled himself from his blankets,
his body moving with mechanical
reaction. The slippers into
which he put his feet were larger
than he had expected them to be.
He walked about the small apartment.
The place was familiar, but
only as it would have been if he
had studied it from blueprints, not
as though he lived there.

The feeling was still with him
when he returned to the psychoanalyst.


THE scene this time was more
kaleidoscopic, less personal.

A village was being ravaged.
Men struggled and died in the
streets. Zarwell moved among
them, seldom taking part in the
individual clashes, yet a moving
force in the <ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'conflct'">conflict.

The background changed. He
understood that he was on a different
world.

Here a city burned. Its resistance
was nearing its end. Zarwell was
riding a shaggy pony outside a high
wall surrounding the stricken metropolis.
He moved in and joined a
party of short, bearded men, directing
them as they battered at the
wall with a huge log mounted on a
many-wheeled truck.

The log broke a breach in the
concrete and the besiegers charged
through, carrying back the defenders
who sought vainly to plug the
gap. Soon there would be rioting
in the streets again, plundering and
killing.

Zarwell was not the leader of the
invaders, only a lesser figure in the
rebellion. But he had played a leading
part in the planning of the
strategy that led to the city&#8217;s fall.
The job had been well done.

Time passed, without visible
break in the panorama. Now Zarwell
was fleeing, pursued by the
same bearded men who had been
his comrades before. Still he moved
with the same firm purpose, vigilant,
resourceful, and well prepared
for the eventuality that had befallen.
He made his escape without
difficulty.

He alighted from a space ship on
still another world&mdash;another shift
in time&mdash;and the atmosphere of
conflict engulfed him.

Weary but resigned he accepted
it, and did what he had to do&nbsp;&hellip;


BERGSTROM was regarding 
him with speculative scrutiny.
&ldquo;You&#8217;ve had quite a past, apparently,&rdquo;
he observed.

[p<span
 class="pgmark">141]<br
 />Zarwell smiled with mild embarrassment.
&ldquo;At least in my dreams.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Dreams?&rdquo; Bergstrom&#8217;s eyes
widened in surprise. &ldquo;Oh, I beg your
pardon. I must have forgotten to
explain. This work is so routine to
me that sometimes I forget it&#8217;s all
new to a patient. Actually what you
experienced under the drug were
not dreams. They were recollections
of real episodes from your
past.&rdquo;

Zarwell&#8217;s expression became
wary. He watched Bergstrom
closely. After a minute, however,
he seemed satisfied, and he let himself
settle back against the cushion
of his chair. &ldquo;I remember nothing
of what I saw,&rdquo; he observed.

&ldquo;That&#8217;s why you&#8217;re here, you
know,&rdquo; Bergstrom answered. &ldquo;To
help you remember.&rdquo;

&ldquo;But everything under the drug
is so&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;

&ldquo;Haphazard? That&#8217;s true. The
recall episodes are always purely
random, with no chronological sequence.
Our problem will be to reassemble
them in proper order
later. Or some particular scene may
trigger a complete memory return.

&ldquo;It is my considered opinion,&rdquo;
Bergstrom went on, &ldquo;that your lost
memory will turn out to be no ordinary
amnesia. I believe we will find
that your mind has been tampered
with.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Nothing I&#8217;ve seen under the
drug fits into the past I do remember.&rdquo;

&ldquo;That&#8217;s what makes me so certain,&rdquo;
Bergstrom said confidently.
&ldquo;You don&#8217;t remember what we
have shown to be true. Conversely
then, what you think you remember
must be false. It must have been
implanted there. But we can go
into that later. For today I think
we have done enough. This episode
was quite prolonged.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I won&#8217;t have any time off again
until next week end,&rdquo; Zarwell reminded
him.

&ldquo;That&#8217;s right.&rdquo; Bergstrom
thought for a moment. &ldquo;We
shouldn&#8217;t let this hang too long.
Could you come here after work
tomorrow?&rdquo;

&ldquo;I suppose I could.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; Bergstrom said with satisfaction.
&ldquo;I&#8217;ll admit I&#8217;m considerably
more than casually interested
in your case by this time.&rdquo;


A WORK truck picked Zarwell
up the next morning and he
rode with a tech crew to the edge of
the reclam area. Beside the belt
bringing ocean muck from the converter
plant at the seashore his
bulldozer was waiting.

He took his place behind the
drive wheel and began working dirt
down between windbreakers anchored
in the rock. Along a makeshift
road into the badlands trucks
brought crushed lime and phosphorus
to supplement the ocean
sediment. The progress of life from
the sea to the land was a mechanical
[p<span
 class="pgmark">142]
 process of this growing world.

Nearly two hundred years ago,
when Earth established a colony on
St. Martin&#8217;s, the land surface of the
planet had been barren. Only its
seas thrived with animal and vegetable
life. The necessary machinery
and technicians had been supplied
by Earth, and the long struggle began
to fit the world for human
needs. When Zarwell arrived, six
months before, the vitalized area
already extended three hundred
miles along the coast, and sixty
miles inland. And every day the
progress continued. A large percentage
of the energy and resources
of the world were devoted to that
essential expansion.

The reclam crews filled and
sodded the sterile rock, planted
binding grasses, grain and trees, and
diverted rivers to keep it fertile.
When there were no rivers to divert
they blasted out springs and lakes
in the foothills to make their own.
Biologists developed the necessary
germ and insect life from what they
found in the sea. Where that failed,
they imported microorganisms
from Earth.

Three rubber-tracked crawlers
picked their way down from the
mountains until they joined the
road passing the belt. They were
loaded with ore that would be
smelted into metal for depleted
Earth, or for other colonies short
of minerals. It was St. Martin&#8217;s only
export thus far.

Zarwell pulled his sun helmet
lower, to better guard his hot, dry
features. The wind blew continuously
on St. Martin&#8217;s, but it furnished
small relief from the heat.
After its three-thousand-mile journey
across scorched sterile rock, it
sucked the moisture from a man&#8217;s
body, bringing a membrane-shrinking
dryness to the nostrils as it was
breathed in. With it came also the
cloying taste of limestone in a
worker&#8217;s mouth.

Zarwell gazed idly about at the
other laborers. Fully three-quarters
of them were beri-rabza ridden. A
cure for the skin fungus had not
yet been found; the men&#8217;s faces
and hands were scabbed and red.
The colony had grown to near self-sufficiency,
would soon have a moderate
prosperity, yet they still
lacked adequate medical and research
facilities.

Not all the world&#8217;s citizens were
content.

Bergstrom was waiting in his office
when Zarwell arrived that
evening.


HE was lying motionless on a
hard cot, with his eyes closed,
yet with his every sense sharply
quickened. Tentatively he tightened
small muscles in his arms and
legs. Across his wrists and thighs
he felt straps binding him to the
cot.

&ldquo;So that&#8217;s our big, bad man,&rdquo; a
coarse voice above him observed
[p<span
 class="pgmark">143]
 caustically. &ldquo;He doesn&#8217;t look so
tough now, does he?&rdquo;

&ldquo;It might have been better to
kill him right away,&rdquo; a second, less
confident voice said. &ldquo;It&#8217;s supposed
to be impossible to hold him.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Don&#8217;t be stupid. We just do
what we&#8217;re told. We&#8217;ll hold him.&rdquo;

&ldquo;What do you think they&#8217;ll do
with him?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Execute him, I suppose,&rdquo; the
harsh voice said matter-of-factly.
&ldquo;They&#8217;re probably just curious to
see what he looks like first. They&#8217;ll
be disappointed.&rdquo;

Zarwell opened his eyes a slit to
observe his surroundings.

It was a mistake. &ldquo;He&#8217;s out of
it,&rdquo; the first speaker said, and Zarwell
allowed his eyes to open fully.

The voice, he saw, belonged to
the big man who had bruised him
against the locker at the spaceport.
Irrelevantly he wondered how he
knew now that it had been a spaceport.

His captor&#8217;s broad face jeered
down at Zarwell. &ldquo;Have a good
sleep?&rdquo; he asked with mock solicitude.
Zarwell did not deign to acknowledge
that he heard.

The big man turned. &ldquo;You can
tell the Chief he&#8217;s awake,&rdquo; he said.
Zarwell followed his gaze to where
a younger man, with a blond lock of
hair on his forehead, stood behind
him. The youth nodded and went
out, while the other pulled a chair
up to the side of Zarwell&#8217;s cot.

While their attention was away
from him Zarwell had unobtrusively
loosened his bonds as much as
possible with arm leverage. As the
big man drew his chair nearer, he
made the hand farthest from him
tight and compact and worked it
free of the leather loop. He waited.

The big man belched. &ldquo;You&#8217;re
supposed to be great stuff in a situation
like this,&rdquo; he said, his smoke-tan
face splitting in a grin that revealed
large square teeth. &ldquo;How
about giving me a sample?&rdquo;

&ldquo;You&#8217;re a yellow-livered bastard,&rdquo;
Zarwell told him.

The grin faded from the oily face
as the man stood up. He leaned over
the cot&mdash;and Zarwell&#8217;s left hand
shot up and locked about his throat,
joined almost immediately by the
right.

The man&#8217;s mouth opened and he
tried to yell as he threw himself
frantically backward. He clawed at
the hands about his neck. When
that failed to break the grip he suddenly
reversed his weight and
drove his fist at Zarwell&#8217;s head.

Zarwell pulled the struggling
body down against his chest and
held it there until all agitated
movement ceased. He sat up then,
letting the body slide to the floor.

The straps about his thighs came
loose with little effort.


THE analyst dabbed at his upper
lip with a handkerchief. &ldquo;The
episodes are beginning to tie together,&rdquo;
he said, with an attempt at
[p<span
 class="pgmark">144]
 nonchalance. &ldquo;The next couple
should do it.&rdquo;

Zarwell did not answer. His
memory seemed on the point of
complete return, and he sat quietly,
hopefully. However, nothing more
came and he returned his attention
to his more immediate problem.

Opening a button on his shirt, he
pulled back a strip of plastic cloth
just below his rib cage and took
out a small flat pistol. He held it
in the palm of his hand. He knew
now why he always carried it.

Bergstrom had his bad moment.
&ldquo;You&#8217;re not going to&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo; he began
at the sight of the gun. He tried
again. &ldquo;You must be joking.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I have very little sense of humor,&rdquo;
Zarwell corrected him.

&ldquo;You&#8217;d be foolish!&rdquo;

Bergstrom obviously realized
how close he was to death. Yet
surprisingly, after the first start,
he showed little fear. Zarwell had
thought the man a bit soft, too
adjusted to a life of ease and some
prestige to meet danger calmly.
Curiosity restrained his trigger finger.

&ldquo;Why would I be foolish?&rdquo; he
asked. &ldquo;Your Meninger oath of inviolable
confidence?&rdquo;

Bergstrom shook his head. &ldquo;I
know it&#8217;s been broken before. But
you need me. You&#8217;re not through,
you know. If you killed me you&#8217;d
still have to trust some other
analyst.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Is that the best you can do?&rdquo;

&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Bergstrom was angry now.
&ldquo;But use that logical mind you&#8217;re
supposed to have! Scenes before
this have shown what kind of man
you are. Just because this last happened
here on St. Martin&#8217;s makes
little difference. If I was going to
turn you in to the police, I&#8217;d have
done it before this.&rdquo;

Zarwell debated with himself the
truth of what the other had said.
&ldquo;Why didn&#8217;t you turn me in?&rdquo; he
asked.

&ldquo;Because you&#8217;re no mad-dog
killer!&rdquo; Now that the crisis seemed
to be past, Bergstrom spoke more
calmly, even allowed himself to
relax. &ldquo;You&#8217;re still pretty much in
the fog about yourself. I read more
in those comanalyses than you did.
I even know who you are!&rdquo;

Zarwell&#8217;s eyebrows raised.

&ldquo;Who am I?&rdquo; he asked, very interested
now. Without attention he
put his pistol away in a trouser
pocket.

Bergstrom brushed the question
aside with one hand. &ldquo;Your name
makes little difference. You&#8217;ve used
many. But you are an idealist. Your
killings were necessary to bring
justice to the places you visited. By
now you&#8217;re almost a legend among
the human worlds. I&#8217;d like to talk
more with you on that later.&rdquo;

While Zarwell considered, Bergstrom
pressed his advantage. &ldquo;One
more scene might do it,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Should we try again&mdash;if you trust
me, that is?&rdquo;

[p<span
 class="pgmark">145]<br
 />Zarwell made his decision quickly.
&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; he answered.


ALL Zarwell&#8217;s attention seemed
on the cigar he lit as he rode
down the escalator, but he surveyed
the terminal carefully over the rim
of his hand. He spied no suspicious
loungers.

Behind the escalator he groped
along the floor beneath the lockers
until he found his key. The briefcase
was under his arm a minute
later.

In the basement lave he put a
coin in the pay slot of a private
compartment and went in.

As he zipped open the briefcase
he surveyed his features in the mirror.
A small muscle at the corner of
one eye twitched spasmodically.
One cheek wore a frozen quarter
smile. Thirty-six hours under the
paralysis was longer than advisable.
The muscles should be rested at
least every twenty hours.

Fortunately his natural features
would serve as an adequate disguise
now.

He adjusted the ring setting on
the pistol-shaped instrument that
he took from his case, and carefully
rayed several small areas of
his face, loosening muscles that had
been tight too long. He sighed
gratefully when he finished, massaging
his cheeks and forehead with
considerable pleasure. Another
glance in the mirror satisfied him
with the changes that had been
made. He turned to his briefcase
again and exchanged the gun for
a small syringe, which he pushed
into a trouser pocket, and a single-edged
razor blade.

Removing his fiber-cloth jacket
he slashed it into strips with the
razor blade and flushed it down the
disposal bowl. With the sleeves of
his blouse rolled up he had the
appearance of a typical workman
as he strolled from the compartment.

Back at the locker he replaced
the briefcase and, with a wad of
gum, glued the key to the bottom
of the locker frame.

One step more. Taking the syringe
from his pocket, he plunged
the needle into his forearm and
tossed the instrument down a
waste chute. He took three more
steps and paused uncertainly.

When he looked about him it
was with the expression of a man
waking from a vivid dream.


&ldquo;QUITE ingenious,&rdquo; Graves
murmured admiringly. &ldquo;You
had your mind already preconditioned
for the shot. But why would
you deliberately give yourself amnesia?&rdquo;

&ldquo;What better disguise than to
believe the part you&#8217;re playing?&rdquo;

&ldquo;A good man must have done
that job on your mind,&rdquo; Bergstrom
commented. &ldquo;I&#8217;d have hesitated to
try it myself. It must have taken a
lot of trust on your part.&rdquo;

[p<span
 class="pgmark">146]<br
 />&ldquo;Trust and money,&rdquo; Zarwell said
drily.

&ldquo;Your memory&#8217;s back then?&rdquo;

Zarwell nodded.

&ldquo;I&#8217;m glad to hear that,&rdquo; Bergstrom
assured him. &ldquo;Now that
you&#8217;re well again I&#8217;d like to introduce
you to a man named Vernon
Johnson. This world&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;

Zarwell stopped him with an upraised
hand. &ldquo;Good God, man, can&#8217;t
you see the reason for all this? I&#8217;m
tired. I&#8217;m trying to quit.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Quit?&rdquo; Bergstrom did not quite
follow him.

&ldquo;It started on my home colony,&rdquo;
Zarwell explained listlessly. &ldquo;A
gang of hoods had taken over the
government. I helped organize a
movement to get them out. There
was some bloodshed, but it went
quite well. Several months later an
unofficial envoy from another
world asked several of us to give
them a hand on the same kind of
job. The political conditions there
were rotten. We went with him.
Again we were successful. It seems
I have a kind of genius for that
sort of thing.&rdquo;

He stretched out his legs and regarded
them thoughtfully. &ldquo;I
learned then the truth of Russell&#8217;s
saying: &lsquo;When the oppressed win
their freedom they are as oppressive
as their former masters.&rsquo; When
they went bad, I opposed them.
This time I failed. But I escaped
again. I have quite a talent for that
also.

&ldquo;I&#8217;m not a professional do-gooder.&rdquo;
Zarwell&#8217;s tone appealed
to Bergstrom for understanding. &ldquo;I
have only a normal man&#8217;s indignation
at injustice. And now I&#8217;ve done
my share. Yet, wherever I go, the
word eventually gets out, and I&#8217;m
right back in a fight again. It&#8217;s like
the proverbial monkey on my back.
I can&#8217;t get rid of it.&rdquo;

He rose. &ldquo;That disguise and
memory planting were supposed to
get me out of it. I should have
known it wouldn&#8217;t work. But this
time I&#8217;m not going to be drawn
back in! You and your Vernon
Johnson can do your own revolting.
I&#8217;m through!&rdquo;

Bergstrom did not argue as he
left.


RESTLESSNESS drove Zarwell
from his flat the next day&mdash;a
legal holiday on St. Martin&#8217;s. At
a railed-off lot he stopped and loitered
in the shadow of an adjacent
building watching workmen drilling
an excavation for a new structure.

When a man strolled to his side
and stood watching the workmen,
he was not surprised. He waited for
the other to speak.

&ldquo;I&#8217;d like to talk to you, if you
can spare a few minutes,&rdquo; the
stranger said.

Zarwell turned and studied the
man without answering. He was
medium tall, with the body of an
athlete, though perhaps ten years
[p<span
 class="pgmark">147]
 beyond the age of sports. He had
a manner of contained energy.
&ldquo;You&#8217;re Johnson?&rdquo; he asked.

The man nodded.

Zarwell tried to feel the anger he
wanted to feel, but somehow it
would not come. &ldquo;We have nothing
to talk about,&rdquo; was the best he
could manage.

&ldquo;Then will you just listen? After,
I&#8217;ll leave&mdash;if you tell me to.&rdquo;

Against his will he found himself
liking the man, and wanting at least
to be courteous. He inclined his
head toward a curb wastebox with
a flat top. &ldquo;Should we sit?&rdquo;

Johnson smiled agreeably and
they walked over to the box and
sat down.

&ldquo;When this colony was first
founded,&rdquo; Johnson began without
preamble, &ldquo;the administrative body
was a governor, and a council of
twelve. Their successors were to
be elected biennially. At first they
were. Then things changed. We
haven&#8217;t had an election now in the
last twenty-three years. St. Martin&#8217;s
is beginning to prosper. Yet
the only ones receiving the benefits
are the rulers. The citizens work
twelve hours a day. They are poorly
housed, poorly fed, poorly clothed.
They&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;

Zarwell found himself not listening
as Johnson&#8217;s voice went on. The
story was always the same. But why
did they always try to drag him into
their troubles?

Why hadn&#8217;t he chosen some
other world on which to hide?

The last question prompted a
new thought. Just why had he
chosen St. Martin&#8217;s? Was it only a
coincidence? Or had he, <ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'subconciously'">subconsciously
at least, picked this particular
world? He had always
considered himself the unwilling
subject of glib persuaders &hellip; but
mightn&#8217;t some inner compulsion of
his own have put the monkey on his
back?

&ldquo;&hellip;&nbsp;and we need your help.&rdquo;
Johnson had finished his speech.

Zarwell gazed up at the bright
sky. He pulled in a long breath,
and let it out in a sigh.

&ldquo;What are your plans so far?&rdquo;
he asked wearily.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
