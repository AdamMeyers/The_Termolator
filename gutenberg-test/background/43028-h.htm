<h2>THE IMPORTED BRIDEGROOM</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Flora was alone in the back parlor, which
she had appropriated for a sort of boudoir.
She sat in her rocker, in front of the parlor
stove, absorbed in "Little Dorrit." Her
well-groomed girlish form was enveloped in
a kindly warmth whose tender embrace
tinged her interest in the narrative with a
triumphant consciousness of the snowstorm
outside.</p>

<p>Little by little the rigid afternoon light
began to fade into a melancholy gray. Dusk
was creeping into the room in almost visible
waves. Flora let the book rest on her lap
and fixed her gaze on the twinkling scarlet
of the stove-glass. The thickening twilight,
the warmth of the apartment, and the atmosphere
of the novel blended together, and for
some moments Flora felt far away from herself.</p>

<p>She was the only girl of her circle who
would read Dickens, Scott, or Thackeray in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
addition to the "Family Story Paper" and
the "Fireside Companion," which were the
exclusive literary purveyors to her former
classmates at the Chrystie Street Grammar
School. There were a piano and a neat little
library in her room.</p>

<p>She was rather tall and well formed. Her
oblong ivory face, accentuated by a mass of
unruly hair of a lustreless black, was never
deserted by a faint glimmer of a smile, at
once pensive and arch. When she broke
into one of her hearty, good-natured laughs,
her deep, dark, appealing eyes would seem
filled with grief. Her nose, a trifle too
precipitous, gave an unexpected tone to the
extreme picturesqueness of the whole effect,
and, when she walked, partook of the dignity
of her gait.</p>

<p>A month or two before we make Flora's
acquaintance she had celebrated her twentieth
birthday, having been born in this little
private house on Mott Street, which was
her father's property.</p>

<p>A matchmaker had recently called, and he
had launched into a eulogy of a young Jewish
physician; but old Stroon had cut him
short, in his blunt way: his only child was
to marry a God-fearing business man, and no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
fellow deep in Gentile lore and shaving his
beard need apply. As to Flora, she was burning
to be a doctor's wife. A rising young
merchant, a few years in the country, was
the staple matrimonial commodity in her set.
Most of her married girl friends, American-born
themselves, like Flora, had husbands
of this class&mdash;queer fellows, whose broken
English had kept their own sweethearts
chuckling. Flora hated the notion of marrying
as the other Mott or Bayard Street
girls did. She was accustomed to use her
surroundings for a background, throwing her
own personality into high relief. But apart
from this, she craved a more refined atmosphere
than her own, and the vague ideal
she had was an educated American gentleman,
like those who lived up-town.</p>

<p>Accordingly, when the word "doctor" had
left the matchmaker's lips, she seized upon
it as a great discovery. In those days&mdash;the
early eighties&mdash;a match of this kind was
an uncommon occurrence in the New York
Ghetto.</p>

<p>Flora pictured a clean-shaven, high-hatted,
spectacled gentleman jumping out of a
buggy, and the image became a fixture in
her mind. "I won't marry anybody except
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
a doctor," she would declare, with conscious
avoidance of bad grammar, as it behooved a
doctor's wife.</p>

<p>But what was to be done with father's
opposition? Asriel Stroon had never been
the man to yield, and now that he grew more
devout every day, her case seemed hopeless.
But then Flora was her father's daughter,
and when she took a resolve she could not
imagine herself otherwise than carrying it
out, sooner or later.</p>

<p>Flora's thoughts were flowing in this direction
when her father's gruff voice made
itself heard from the dining-room below.
It was the anniversary of his father's death.
In former years he would have contented
himself with obit services, at the synagogue;
this time, however, he had passed the day in
fasting and chanting psalms at home, in addition
to lighting his own candle in front of
the cantor's desk and reciting <i>Kaddish</i> for
the departed soul, at the house of prayer.
It touched Flora's heart to think of him
fasting and praying all day, and, with her
book in her hand, she ran down to meet him.</p>

<p>"Just comin' from the synagogue, papa?"
she greeted him affectionately, in English.
"This settles your fast, don't it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
"It is not so easy to settle with Him, my
daughter," he returned, in Yiddish, pointing
to the ceiling. "You can never be through
serving the Uppermost. Hurry up, Tamara!"
he added, in the direction of the adjoining
kitchen.</p>

<p>"You ain' goin' to say more Thilim<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> to-night,
are you, pa?"</p>

<p>"Why, does it cost you too much?" he
snarled good humoredly.</p>

<p>"Yes it does&mdash;your health. I won't let
you sing again. You are weak and you got
enough."</p>

<p>"Hush! It is not potato-soup; you can
never have enough of it." He fell to tugging
nervously at his white beard, which
grew in a pair of tiny imperials. "Tamara!
It's time to break the fast, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"You can wash your hands. Supper is
ready," came the housekeeper's pleasant
voice.</p>

<p>He took off his brown derby, and covered
his steel-gray hair with a velvet skull-cap;
and as he carried his robust, middle-sized
body into the kitchen, to perform his ablutions,
his ruddy, gnarled face took on an air
of piety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
When supper was over and Asriel and
Tamara were about to say grace, Flora resumed
the reading of her novel.</p>

<p>"Off with that lump of Gentile nastiness
while holy words are being said!" the old
man growled.</p>

<p>Flora obeyed, in amazement. Only a few
months before she had seldom seen him intone
grace at all. She was getting used to
his new habits, but such rigor as he now
displayed was unintelligible to her, and she
thought it unbearable.</p>

<p>"You can read your book a little after.
The wisdom of it will not run away," chimed
in Tamara, with good-natured irony. She
was a poor widow of forty. Asriel had engaged
her for her piety and for the rabbinical
learning of her late husband, as much
as for her culinary fame in the Ghetto.</p>

<p>Asriel intoned grace in indistinct droning
accents. By degrees, however, as he warmed
up to the Hebrew prayer, whose words were
a conglomeration of incomprehensible sounds
to him, he fell to swaying to and fro, and
his voice broke into an exalted, heartrending
sing-song, Tamara accompanying him
in whispers, and dolefully nodding her bewigged
head all the while.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
Flora was moved. The scene was novel to
her, and she looked on with the sympathetic
reverence of a Christian visiting a Jewish
synagogue on the Day of Atonement.</p>

<p>At last the fervent tones died away in a
solemn murmur. Silence fell over the cosy
little room. Asriel sat tugging at his scanty
beard as if in an effort to draw it into a
more venerable growth.</p>

<p>"Flora!" he presently growled. "I am
going to Europe."</p>

<p>When Asriel Stroon thought he spoke,
and when he spoke he acted.</p>

<p>"Goin' to Europe! Are you crazy, papa?
What are you talkin' about?"</p>

<p>"Just what you hear. After Passover I
am going to Europe. I must take a look
at Pravly."</p>

<p>"But you ain't been there over thirty-five
years. You don't remember not'in' at all."</p>

<p>"I don't remember Pravly? Better than
Mott Street; better than my nose. I was
born there, my daughter," he added, as he
drew closer to her and began to stroke her
glossless black hair. This he did so seldom
that the girl felt her heart swelling in her
throat. She was yearning after him in advance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
Tamara stared in beaming amazement at
the grandeur of the enterprise. "Are you
really going?" she queried, with a touch of
envy.</p>

<p>"What will you do there?&mdash;It's so far
away!" Flora resumed, for want of a weightier
argument at hand.</p>

<p>"Never mind, my child; I won't have to
walk all the way."</p>

<p>"But the Russian police will arrest you
for stayin' away so long. Didn't you say
they would?"</p>

<p>"The kernel of a hollow nut!" he replied,
extemporizing an equivalent of "Fiddlesticks!"
Flora was used to his metaphors,
although they were at times rather
vague, and set one wondering how they came
into his head at all. "The kernel of a hollow
nut! Show a <i>treif</i><a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> gendarme a <i>kosher</i><a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
coin, and he will be shivering with
ague. Long live the American dollar!"</p>

<p>She gave him a prolonged, far-away look,
and said, peremptorily:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mister, you ain' goin' nowheres."</p>

<p>"Tamara, hand me my Psalter, will you?"
the old man grumbled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
When the girl was gone, the housekeeper
inquired:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And Flora&mdash;will you take her along?"</p>

<p>"What for? That she might make fun
of our ways there, or that the pious people
should point their fingers at her and call
her Gentile girl, hey? She will stay with
you and collect rent. I did not have her in
Pravly, and I want to be there as I used to.
I feel like taking a peep at the graves of my
folks. It is pulling me by the heart, Tamara,"
he added, in a grave undertone, as he
fell to turning over the leaves of his Psalter.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>When Asriel Stroon had retired from
business, he suddenly grew fearful of death.
Previously he had had no time for that.
What with his flour store, two bakeries, and
some real estate, he had been too busy to
live, much less to think of death. He had
never been seen at the synagogue on week-days;
and on the Sabbath, when, enveloped
in his praying-shawl, he occupied a seat at
the East Wall, he would pass the time
drowsing serenely and nodding unconscious
approval of the cantor's florid improvisations,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
or struggling to keep flour out of his
mind, where it clung as pertinaciously as it
did to his long Sabbath coat.</p>

<p>The first sermon that failed to lull him
to sleep was delivered by a newly landed
preacher, just after Asriel had found it
more profitable to convert his entire property
into real estate. The newcomer dwelt,
among other things, upon the fate of the
wicked after death and upon their forfeited
share in the World to Come. As Asriel
listened to the fiery exhortation it suddenly
burst upon him that he was very old and
very wicked. "I am as full of sins as a
watermelon is of seeds," he said to himself,
on coming out of the synagogue. "You may
receive notice to move at any time, Asriel.
And where is your baggage? Got anything
to take along to the other world, as the
preacher said, hey?"</p>

<p>Alas! he had been so taken up with
earthly title deeds that he had given but
little thought to such deeds as would entitle
him to a "share in the World to Come;"
and while his valuable papers lay secure
between the fireproof walls of his iron safe,
his soul was left utterly exposed to the
flames of Sheol.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
Then it was that he grew a pair of bushy
sidelocks, ceased trimming his twin goatees,
and, with his heart divided between yearning
after the business he had sold and worrying
over his sins, spent a considerable
part of his unlimited leisure reading psalms.</p>

<p>What a delight it was to wind off chapter
after chapter! And how smoothly it now
came off, in his father's (peace upon him!)
sing-song, of which he had not even thought
for more than thirty years, but which suddenly
came pouring out of his throat, together
with the first verse he chanted! Not
that Asriel Stroon could have told you the
meaning of what he was so zestfully intoning,
for in his boyhood he had scarcely gone
through the Pentateuch when he was set to
work by his father's side, at flax heckling.
But then the very sounds of the words and
the hereditary intonation, added to the consciousness
that it was psalms he was reciting,
"made every line melt like sugar in his
mouth," as he once described it to the devout
housekeeper.</p>

<p>He grew more pious and exalted every
day, and by degrees fell prey to a feeling
to which he had been a stranger for more
than three decades.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
Asriel Stroon grew homesick.</p>

<p>It was thirty-five years since he had left
his birthplace; thirty years or more since,
in the whirl of his American successes, he
had lost all interest in it. Yet now, in the
fifty-eighth year of his life, he suddenly
began to yearn and pine for it.</p>

<p>Was it the fervor of his religious awakening
which resoldered the long-broken link?
At all events, numerous as were the examples
of piety within the range of his American
acquaintance, his notion of genuine Judaism
was somehow inseparably associated
with Pravly. During all the years of his
life in New York he had retained a vague
but deep-rooted feeling that American piety
was as tasteless an article as American
cucumbers and American fish&mdash;the only
things in which his ecstasy over the adopted
country admitted its hopeless inferiority to
his native town.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>On a serene afternoon in May, Asriel drove
up to Pravly in a peasant's wagon. He
sat listlessly gazing at the unbroken line of
wattle-fences and running an imaginary stick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
along the endless zigzag of their tops. The
activity of his senses seemed suspended.</p>

<p>Presently a whiff of May aroma awakened
his eye to a many-colored waving expanse,
and his ear to the languorous whisper of
birds. He recognized the plushy clover
knobs in the vast array of placid magnificence,
and the dandelions and the golden
buttercups, although his poor mother-tongue
could not afford a special name for each
flower, and he now addressed them collectively
as <i>tzatzkes</i>&mdash;a word he had not used
for thirty-five years. He looked at the
tzatzkes, as they were swaying thoughtfully
hither and thither, and it somehow seemed
to him that it was not the birds but the
clover blossoms which did the chirping. The
whole scene appealed to his soul as a nodding,
murmuring congregation engrossed in
the solemnity of worship. He felt as though
there were no such flowers in America, and
that he had not seen any since he had left
his native place.</p>

<p>Echoes of many, many years ago called to
Asriel from amid the whispering host. His
soul burst into song. He felt like shutting
his eyes and trusting himself to the caressing
breath of the air, that it might waft him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
whithersoever it chose. His senses were in
confusion: he beheld a sea of fragrance; he
inhaled heavenly music; he listened to a
symphony of hues.</p>

<p>"What a treat to breathe! What a paradise!"
he exclaimed in his heart. "The
cholera take it, how delicious! Do you
deserve it, old sinner you? Ten plagues
you do! But hush! the field is praying"&mdash;</p>

<p>With a wistful babyish look he became
absorbed in a gigantic well-sweep suspended
from the clear sky, and then in the landscape
it overhung. The woody mass darkling
in the distance was at once racing about
and standing still. Fleecy clouds crawled
over a hazy hill-top. And yonder&mdash;behold!
a long, broad streak of silver gleaming on
the horizon! Is it a lake? Asriel's eyes
are riveted and memories stir in his breast.
He recalls not the place itself, but he can
remember his reminiscences of it. During
his first years in America, at times when he
would surrender himself to the sweet pangs
of homesickness and dwell, among other
things, on the view that had seen him off to
the unknown land, his mind would conjure
up something like the effect now before his
eyes. As a dream does it come back to him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
now. The very shadows of thirty-five years
ago are veiled.</p>

<p>Asriel gazes before him in deep reverence.
The sky is letting itself down with benign
solemnity, its measureless trough filled with
melody, the peasant's wagon creaking an
accompaniment to it all&mdash;to every speck of
color, as well as to every sound of the scene.</p>

<p>At one moment he felt as though he had
strayed into the other world; at another, he
was seized with doubt as to his own identity.
"Who are you?" he almost asked himself,
closing and reopening his hand experimentally.
"Who or what is that business which
you call life? Are you alive, Asriel?"
Whereupon he somehow remembered Flora's
photograph, and, taking it out of his bosom
pocket, fell to contemplating it.</p>

<p>The wagon turned into a side-road, and
the Polish peasant, leaning forward, cursed
and whipped the animal into a peevish trot.
Presently something gray hove in sight.
Far away, below, hazy blotches came creeping
from behind the sky. The wagon rolls
downhill. Asriel is in a flurry. He feels
like one on the eve of a great event, he
knows not exactly what.</p>

<p>The wagon dashes on. Asriel's heart is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
all of a flutter. Suddenly&mdash;O Lord of the
Universe! Why, there glistens the brook&mdash;what
do you call it? 'Repka?'" he asks
the driver.</p>

<p>"Repka!" the other replies, without facing
about.</p>

<p>"Repka, a disease into her heart! Repka,
dear, may she live long! Who could beat
Asriel in swimming?" Over there, on the
other side, it was where Asriel's father once
chased him for bathing during Nine Days.
He bumped his head against the angle of a
rock, did the little scamp, and got up with a
deep, streaming gash in his lower lip. The
mark is still there, and Asriel delights to feel
it with his finger now. As he does so the
faces of some of his playmates rise before
him. Pshaw! he could whip every one of
them! Was he not a dare-devil of a loafer!
But how many of those fellow truants of his
will he find alive? he asks himself, and the
question wrings his heart.</p>

<p>Asriel strains his eyes at the far distance
till, behold! smoke is spinning upward
against the blue sky. He can make out the
chimney-pots. His soul overflows. Sobs
choke his breath. "Say!" he begins, addressing
himself to the driver. But "Say"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
is English. "<i lang="pl" xml:lang="pl">Sloukhai!</i>" he shouts, with
delight in the Polish word. He utters the
names of the surrounding places, and the
dull peasant's nods of assent thrill him to
the core. He turns this way and that, and
in his paroxysm of impatience all but leaps
out of the wagon.</p>

<p>The rambling groups of houses define their
outlines. Asriel recognizes the Catholic
church. His heart bounds with joy. "Hush,
wicked thing! It's a church of Gentiles."
But the wicked thing surreptitiously resumes
its greeting. And over there, whitening at
some distance from the other dwellings&mdash;what
is it? "The nobleman's palace, as
sure as I am a Jew!" He had forgotten all
about it, as sure as he was a Jew! But what
is the nobleman's name? Is he alive?&mdash;And
there is the mill&mdash;the same mill!
"I'll swoon away!" he says to himself
audibly.</p>

<p>Asriel regains some composure.</p>

<p>Half an hour later he made his entry into
his native town. Here he had expected his
agitation to pass the bounds of his physical
strength; but it did not. At this moment
he was solemnly serene.</p>

<p>The town had changed little, and he recognized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
it at once. Every spot greeted him,
and his return of the salutation was a
speechless devotional pathos. He found
several things which had faded out of his
enshrined picture of the place, and the sight
of these moved his soul even more powerfully
than those he had looked forward to. Only
in one instance was he taken aback. Sure
enough, this is Synagogue Lane, as full of
puddles as ever; but what has come over
him? He well remembers that little alley in
the rear; and yet it runs quite the other
way. Length has turned into width.</p>

<p>And here is Leizer Poisner's inn. "But
how rickety it has become!" Asriel's heart
exclaims with a pang, as though at sight of
a friend prematurely aged and run to seed.
He can almost smell the stable occupying the
entire length of the little building, and he
remembers every room&mdash;Hello! The same
market place, the same church with the bailiff's
office by its side! The sparse row of
huts on the river-bank, the raft bridge, the
tannery,&mdash;everything was the same as he
had left it; and yet it all had an odd, mysterious,
far-away air&mdash;like things seen in a
cyclorama. It was Pravly and at the same
time it was not; or, rather, it certainly was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
the same dear old Pravly, but added to it
was something else, through which it now
gazed at Asriel. Thirty-five years lay
wrapped about the town.</p>

<p>Still, Stroon feels like Asrielke Thirteen
Hairs, as his nickname had been here. Then
he relapses into the Mott Street landlord,
and for a moment he is an utter stranger
in his birthplace. Why, he could buy it all
up now! He could discount all the rich
men in town put together; and yet there
was a time when he was of the meanest hereabout.
An overpowering sense of triumph
surged into his breast. Hey, there! Where
are your bigbugs&mdash;Zorach Latozky, Reb
Lippe, Reb Nochum? Are they alive?
Thirty-five years ago Asrielke considered it
an honor to shake their palm branch on the
Feast of Tabernacles, while now&mdash;out with
your purses, you proud magnates, measure
fortunes with Asrielke the heckler, if you
dare! His heart swells with exultation.
And yet&mdash;the black year take it!&mdash;it
yearns and aches, does Asriel's heart. He
looks at Pravly, and his soul is pining for
Pravly&mdash;for the one of thirty-five years ago,
of which this is only a reflection,&mdash;for the
one in which he was known as a crackbrained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
rowdy of a mechanic, a poor devil
living on oatmeal and herring.</p>

<p>With the townspeople of his time Asriel's
experience was somewhat different from
what he felt in the case of inanimate Pravly.
As he confronted them some faces lighted
up with their identity at once; and there
were even some younger people in whom he
instantly recognized the transcribed images
of their deceased parents. But many a countenance
was slow to catch the reflection of
the past which shone out of his eyes; and
in a few instances it was not until the name
was revealed to Asriel that the retrospective
likeness would begin to struggle through
the unfamiliar features before him.</p>

<p>"Shmulke!" he shrieked, the moment he
caught sight of an old crony, as though they
had been parted for no move than a month.
Shmulke is not the blooming, sprightly young
fellow of yore. He has a white beard and
looks somewhat decrepit. Asriel, however,
feels as if the beard were only glued to the
smooth face he had known. But how Asriel's
heart does shrink in his bosom! The
fever of activity in which he had passed
the thirty-five years had kept him deaf to
the departing footsteps of Time. Not until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
recently had he realized that the words "old
man" applied to him; but even then the
fact never came home to him with such convincing,
with such terrible force, as it did
now that he stood face to face with Shmulke.
Shmulke was his mirror.</p>

<p>"Shmulke, Angel of Death, an inflammation
into your bones!" he shouted, as he
suddenly remembered his playmate's by-name
and fell on his shoulder.</p>

<p>Shmulke feels awkward. He is ashamed
of the long-forgotten nickname, and is struggling
to free himself from the unwelcome
embrace; but Asriel is much the stronger
of the two, and he continues to squeeze him
and pat him, grunting and puffing for emotion
as he does so.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah-Rachel, whom Asriel had left
an elderly but exceedingly active and clever
tradeswoman, he found a bag of bones and
in her dotage.</p>

<p>"Don't you know me, auntie?" he implored
her. She made no reply, and went
on munching her lips. "Can it be that you
don't know Asrielke, who used to steal raisins
from your grocery?"</p>

<p>"She does not understand anything!"
Asriel whispered, in consternation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Asriel's first Sabbath in the native place
he was revisiting was destined to be a
memorable day in the annals of that peaceful
little town.</p>

<p>At the synagogue, during the morning
service, he was not the only object of interest.
So far as the furtive glances that
came through the peepholes of the women's
compartment were concerned, a much
younger guest, from a hamlet near by, had
even greater magnetism than he. Reb Lippe,
for forty years the "finest householder"
of the community, expected to marry his
youngest daughter to an <i>Illoui</i> (a prodigy
of Talmudic lore), and he now came to
flaunt him, and the five-thousand rouble
dowry he represented, before the congregation.</p>

<p>Only nineteen and a poor orphan, the
fame of the prospective bridegroom, as a
marvel of acumen and memory, reached far
and wide. Few of the subtlest rabbinical
minds in the district were accounted his
match in debate, and he was said to have
some two thousand Talmudical folios literally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
at his finger's ends. This means that
if you had placed the tip of your finger on
some word of a volume, he could have told
you the word which came under your pressure
on any other page you might name. As we
shall have to cultivate the young man's acquaintance,
let it be added that he was quite
boyish of figure, and that had it not been
for an excess of smiling frankness, his pale,
blue-eyed face would have formed the nearest
Semitic approach to the current portraits
of Lord Byron. His admirers deplored
his lack of staidness. While visiting
at Pravly, in a manner, as the guest of the
town, he was detected giving snuff to a pig,
and then participating with much younger
boys in a race over the bridge.</p>

<p>His betrothment to Reb Lippe's daughter
was still the subject of negotiation, and
there were said to be serious obstacles in
the way. The prodigy's relatives were
pleased with Reb Lippe's pedigree and social
rank, but thought that the boy could
marry into a wealthier family and get a
prettier girl into the bargain. Nevertheless
Reb Lippe's manner at the synagogue
was as though the engagement were an accomplished
fact, and he kept the young man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
by his side, his own seat being next the rabbi's,
which was by the Holy Ark.</p>

<p>Asriel, as a newcomer, and out of respect
for his fabulous wealth, was also accorded a
seat of honor on the other side of the Ark.
Before he had expatriated himself his place
used to be near the door&mdash;a circumstance
which was fresh in the mind of Reb Lippe,
who chafed to see him divert attention from
the prodigy and his purchaser. Now Reb
Lippe was a proud old gentleman, too jealous
of the memory of his rabbinical ancestry
and of his own time-honored dignity to give
way to a mere boor of a heckler, no matter
how much American gold he had to atone
for his antecedents. Accordingly, when his
fellow trustee suggested that the American
ought to be summoned to the reading of the
Third Section in the week's portion of the
Pentateuch,&mdash;the highest honor connected
with the reading of the Law, and one for
which the visiting nabob was sure to pay
a liberal donation,&mdash;the venerable countenance
turned crimson.</p>

<p>"Let the sections be auctioned off!" he
jerked out.</p>

<p>The proceeding was seldom practiced on
an ordinary Sabbath; but Reb Lippe's will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
was law, as peremptory and irresistible as
the Law of Moses, with which it was now
concerned. And so the worshipers presently
found themselves converted into so
many eye-witnesses of a battle of purses.</p>

<p>"Five gildens for the Third!" called out
the weazen-faced little sexton from the
reading-platform, in the traditional sing-song
that became his draggling black beard
so well. As a bona-fide business transaction
is not allowed on the holy day, even though
the house of God be the sole gainer by it,
the sexton's figures were fictitious&mdash;in so
far, at least, as they were understood to
represent double the actual amount to be
paid to the synagogue by the purchaser of
the good deed.</p>

<p>"Six gildens for the Third!" he went on
in interpretation of a frowning nod from
Reb Lippe.</p>

<p>A contemptuous toss of Asriel's head
threw another gilden on top of the sum.
Two other members signaled to the auctioneer,
and, warming up to his task, he
sang out with gusto, "Eight gildens for the
Third!"</p>

<p>Then came in rapid succession: "Nine
gildens for the Third! Ten gildens for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
Third! Eleven gildens, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen gildens for the Third!"</p>

<p>The other bidders, one by one, dropped
out of the race, and when the sum reached
sixty gildens the field was left to Reb Lippe
and Asriel.</p>

<p>The congregation was spellbound. Some
with gaping mouths, others with absorbed
simpers on their faces, but all with sportsman-like
fire in their eyes, the worshipers
craned their necks in the direction of the
two contestants alternately.</p>

<p>The prodigy had edged away from his
seat to a coign of vantage. He was repeatedly
called back by winks from his uncle,
but was too deeply interested in the progress
of the auction to heed them.</p>

<p>"Seventy gildens for the Third! Seventy-one,
seventy-two, three, four, five, seventy-six,
seventy-seven, eight, nine, eighty gildens
for the Third!"</p>

<p>The skirmish waxed so hot, shots flew so
thick and so fast, that the perspiring sexton,
and with him some of the spectators, was
swiveling his head from right to left and
from left to right with the swift regularity
of gymnastic exercise.</p>

<p>It must be owned that so far as mute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
partisanship was concerned, Asriel had the
advantage of his adversary, for even some
of Reb Lippe's stanchest friends and admirers
had a lurking relish for seeing it
brought home to their leading citizen that
there were wealthier people than he in the
world.</p>

<p>The women, too, shared in the excitement
of the morning. Their windows were glistening
with eyes, and the reports of their
lucky occupants to the anxious knots in the
rear evoked hubbubs of conflicting interjections
which came near involving the matronly
assemblage in civil war.</p>

<p>The Third Section brought some twenty-eight
rubles, net. Asriel was certain that
the last bid had been made by him, and that
the honor and the good deed were accordingly
his. When it came to the reading,
however, and the Third Section was reached,
the reader called out Reb Lippe's name.</p>

<p>Asriel was stupefied.</p>

<p>"Hold on! That won't do!" he thundered,
suddenly feeling himself an American
citizen. "I have bought it and I mean to
have it." His face was fire; his eyes looked
havoc.</p>

<p>A wave of deprecation swept over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
room. Dozens of reading-desks were slapped
for order. Reb Lippe strode up to the platform,
pompous, devout, resplendent in the
gold lace of his praying-shawl and the flowing
silver of his beard, as though the outburst
of indignation against Asriel were
only an ovation to himself. He had the
cunning of a fox, the vanity of a peacock,
and the sentimentality of a woman during
the Ten Days of Penance. There were
many skeptics as to the fairness of the transaction,
but these were too deeply impressed
by the grandeur of his triumphal march to
whisper an opinion. The prodigy alone
spoke his mind.</p>

<p>"Why, I do think the other man was the
last to nod&mdash;may I be ill if he was not,"
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enfant terrible</i> said quite audibly, and
was hushed by his uncle.</p>

<p>"Is he really going to get it?" Asriel
resumed, drowning all opposition with his
voice. "Milk a billy-goat! You can't play
that trick on me! Mine was the last bid.
Twenty-eight scurvy rubles! Pshaw! I
am willing to pay a hundred, two hundred,
five hundred. I can buy up all Pravly, Reb
Lippe, his gold lace and all, and sell him
at a loss, too!" He made a dash at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
reading-platform, as if to take the Third
Section by force, but the bedlam which his
sally called forth checked him.</p>

<p>"Is this a market-place?" cried the
second trustee, with conscious indignation.</p>

<p>"Shut the mouth of that boor!" screamed
a member, in sincere disgust.</p>

<p>"Put him out!" yelled another, with
relish in the scene.</p>

<p>"If he can't behave in a holy place let
him go back to his America!" exclaimed a
third, merely to be in the running. But his
words had the best effect: they reminded
Asriel that he was a stranger and that the
noise might attract the police.</p>

<p>At the same moment he saw the peaked
face of the aged rabbi by his side. Taking
him by the arm, the old man begged him
not to disturb the Sabbath.</p>

<p>Whether the mistake was on Asriel's side
or on the sexton's, or whether there was any
foul play in the matter, is not known; but
Asriel relented and settled down at his desk
to follow the remainder of the reading in
his Pentateuch, although the storm of revenge
which was raging in his breast soon
carried off his attention, and he lost track.</p>

<p>The easy success of his first exhortation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
brought the rabbi to Asriel's side once
again.</p>

<p>"I knew your father,&mdash;peace upon him!
He was a righteous Jew," he addressed him
in a voice trembling and funereal with old
age. "Obey me, my son, ascend the platform,
and offer the congregation a public
apology. The Holy One&mdash;blessed be He&mdash;will
help you."</p>

<p>The rabbi's appeal moved Asriel to tears,
and tingling with devout humility he was
presently on the platform, speaking in his
blunt, gruff way.</p>

<p>"Do not take it hard, my rabbis! I
meant no offense to any one, though there
was a trick&mdash;as big as a fat bull. Still, I
donate two hundred rubles, and let the
cantor recite 'God full of Mercy' for the
souls of my father and mother,&mdash;peace upon
them."</p>

<p>It was quite a novel way of announcing
one's contribution, and the manner of his
apology, too, had at once an amusing and a
scandalizing effect upon the worshipers,
but the sum took their breath away and
silenced all hostile sentiment.</p>

<p>The reading over, and the scrolls restored,
amid a tumultuous acclaim, to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
Holy Ark, the cantor resumed his place at
the Omud, chanting a hurried <i>Half-Kaddish</i>.
"And say ye Amen!" he concluded
abruptly, as if startled, together with his
listeners, into sudden silence.</p>

<p>Nodding or shaking their heads, or swaying
their forms to and fro, some, perhaps
mechanically, others with composed reverence,
still others in a convulsion of religious
fervor, the two or three hundred men were
joined in whispering chorus, offering the
solemn prayer of <i>Mussaff</i>. Here and there
a sigh made itself heard amid the monotony
of speechless, gesticulating ardor; a pair of
fingers snapped in an outburst of ecstasy, a
sob broke from some corner, or a lugubrious
murmur from the women's room. The prodigy,
his eyes shut, and his countenance
stern with unfeigned rapture, was violently
working his lips as if to make up for the
sounds of the words which they dared not
utter. Asriel was shaking and tossing about.
His face was distorted with the piteous,
reproachful mien of a neglected child about
to burst into tears, his twin imperials dancing
plaintively to his whispered intonations. He
knew not what his lips said, but he did
know that his soul was pouring itself forth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
before Heaven, and that his heart might
break unless he gave way to his restrained
sobs.</p>

<p>At last the silent devotions were at an
end. One after another the worshipers
retreated, each three paces from his post.
Only three men were still absorbed in the
sanctity of the great prayer: the rabbi, for
whom the cantor was respectfully waiting
with the next chant, Reb Lippe, who would
not "retreat" sooner than the rabbi, and
Asriel, who, in his frenzy of zeal, was repeating
the same benediction for the fifth
time.</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>When Asriel issued forth from the synagogue
he found Pravly completely changed.
It was as if, while he was praying and battling,
the little town had undergone a trivializing
process. All the poetry of thirty-five
years' separation had fled from it, leaving a
heap of beggarly squalor. He felt as though
he had never been away from the place, and
were tired to death of it, and at the same
time his heart was contracted with homesickness
for America. The only interest the
town now had for him was that of a medium
to be filled with the rays of his financial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
triumph. "I'll show them who they are
and who Asriel is," he comforted himself.</p>

<p>The afternoon service was preceded by
a sermon. The "town preacher" took his
text, as usual, from the passage in the "Five
Books" which had been read in the morning.
But he contrived to make it the basis
of an allusion to the all-absorbing topic of
gossip. Citing the Talmud and the commentaries
with ostentatious profuseness, he
laid particular stress on the good deed of
procuring a scholar of sacred lore for one's
son-in-law.</p>

<p>"It is a well-known saying in tractate
<i>Psohim</i>," he said, "that 'one should be ready
to sell his all in order to marry his daughter
to a scholar.' On the other hand, 'to give
your daughter in marriage to a boor is like
giving her to a lion.' Again, in tractate
<i>Berochath</i> we learn that 'to give shelter to
a scholar bent upon sacred studies, and to
sustain him from your estates, is like offering
sacrifices to God;' and 'to give wine
to such a student is,' according to a passage
in tractate <i>Sota</i>, 'tantamount to pouring it
out on an altar.'"</p>

<p>Glances converged on Reb Lippe and the
prodigy by his side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Proceeding with his argument, the learned
preacher, by an ingenious chain of quotations
and arithmetical operations upon the
numerical value of letters, arrived at the
inference that compliance with the above
teachings was one of the necessary conditions
of securing a place in the Garden of
Eden.</p>

<p>All of which filled Asriel's heart with a
new dread of the world to come and with a
rankling grudge against Reb Lippe. He
came away from the synagogue utterly
crushed, and when he reached his inn the
prodigy was the prevailing subject of his
chat with the landlord.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>In the evening of the same day, at the
conclusion of the Sabbath, the auction of
another good deed took place, and once more
the purses of Reb Lippe and Asriel clashed
in desperate combat.</p>

<p>This time the good deed assumed the form
of a prodigy of Talmudic learning in the
character of a prospective son-in-law.</p>

<p>The room (at the residence of one of the
young man's uncles) was full of bearded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
Jews, tobacco smoke, and noise. There were
Shaya, the prodigy himself, his two uncles,
Reb Lippe, his eldest son, and two of his
lieutenants, Asriel, his landlord, and a matchmaker.
A live broad-shouldered samovar,
its air-holes like so many glowing eyes, stood
in the centre of the table. Near it lay Flora's
photograph, representing her in all the
splendor of Grand Street millinery.</p>

<p>The youthful hero of the day eyed the
portrait with undisguised, open-mouthed curiosity,
till, looked out of countenance by the
young lady's doleful, penetrating eyes, he
turned from it, but went on viewing it with
furtive interest.</p>

<p>His own formula of a bride was a hatless
image. The notion, therefore, of this princess
becoming his wife both awed him and
staggered his sense of decorum. Then the
smiling melancholy of the Semitic face upset
his image of himself in his mind and set it
afloat in a haze of phantasy. "I say you
need not look at me like that," he seemed to
say to the picture. "Pshaw! you are a Jewish
girl after all, and I am not afraid of you a
bit. But what makes you so sad? Can I
do anything for you? Why don't you answer?
Do take off that hat, will you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
Reb Lippe's daughter did not wear a hat,
but she was not to his liking, and he now
became aware of it. On the other hand, the
word "America" had a fascinating ring,
and the picture it conjured was a blend of
Talmudic and modern glory.</p>

<p>Reb Lippe's venerable beard was rippled
with a nervous smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am only a boor!" roared Asriel,
with a touch of Bounderby ostentation.
"But you know it is not myself I want the
boy to marry. Twenty thousand rubles,
spot cash, then, and when the old boor takes
himself off, Shaya will inherit ten times as
much. She is my only child, and when I
die&mdash;may I be choked if I take any of my
houses into the grave. Worms don't eat
houses, you know."</p>

<p>The quality of his unhackneyed phrase
vexed the sedate old talmudists, and one of
them remarked, as he pointed a sarcastic
finger at the photograph:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your girl looks like the daughter of some
titled Gentile. Shaya is a Jewish boy."</p>

<p>"You don't like my girl, don't you?"
Asriel darted back. "And why, pray? Is
it because she is not a lump of ugliness and
wears a hat? The grand rabbi of Wilna is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
as pious as any of you, isn't he? Well,
when I was there, on my way here, I saw his
daughter, and she also wore a hat and was
also pretty. Twenty thousand rubles!"</p>

<p>By this time the prodigy was so absorbed
in the proceedings that he forgot the American
photograph, as well as the bearing which
the auction in progress had upon himself.
Leaning over the table as far as the samovar
would allow, and propping up his face with
both arms, he watched the scene with thrilling
but absolutely disinterested relish.</p>

<p>After a great deal of whispering and suppressed
excitement in the camp of Asriel's
foe, Reb Lippe's son announced:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ten thousand rubles and five years'
board." This, added to Reb Lippe's advantages
over his opponent by virtue of his
birth, social station, and learning, as well as
of his residing in Russia, was supposed to
exceed the figure named by Asriel. In point
of fact, everybody in the room knew that the
old talmudist's bid was much beyond his
depth; but the assemblage had no time to
be surprised by his sum, for no sooner had
it been uttered than Asriel yelled out, with
impatient sarcasm:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thirty thousand rubles, and life-long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
board, and lodging, and bath money, and
stocking darning, and cigarettes, and matches,
and mustard, and soap&mdash;and what else?"</p>

<p>The prodigy burst into a chuckle, and was
forthwith pulled down to his chair. He took
a liking to the rough-and-ready straightforwardness
of the American.</p>

<p>There was a pause. Shaya and his uncles
were obviously leaning toward the "boor."
Asriel was clearly the master of the situation.</p>

<p>At last Reb Lippe and his suite rose from
their seats.</p>

<p>"You can keep the bargain!" he said to
Asriel, with a sardonic smile.</p>

<p>"And be choked with it!" added his son.</p>

<p>"What is your hurry, Reb Lippe?" said
one of the uncles, rushing to the old man's
side with obsequious solicitude. "Why, the
thing is not settled yet. We don't know
whether"&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> don't, but I do. I won't take that
boy if <em>he</em> brings twenty thousand roubles to
<em>his</em> marriage portion. Good-night!"</p>

<p>"Good-night and good-year!" Asriel returned.
"Why does the cat hate the cream?
Because it is locked up."</p>

<p>An hour afterward the remainder of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
gathering were touching glasses and interchanging
<i>mazol-tovs</i> (congratulations) upon
the engagement of Flora Stroon to Shaya
Golub.</p>

<p>"And now receive my <i>mazol-tov</i>!" said
Asriel, pouncing upon the prodigy and nearly
crushing him in his mighty embrace. "<em>Mazol-tov</em>
to you, Flora's bridegroom! <em>Mazol-tov</em>
to you, Flora's predestinated one! My
child's dear little bridegroom!" he went on,
hiding his face on the young man's shoulder.
"I am only a boor, but you shall be my son-in-law.
I'll dine you and wine you, as the
preacher commanded, pearls will I strew on
your righteous path, a crown will I place on
your head&mdash;I am only a boor!"</p>

<p>Sobs rang in the old man's voice. The
bystanders looked on in smiling, pathetic
silence.</p>

<p>"A boor, but an honest man," some one
whispered to the uncles.</p>

<p>"A heart of gold!" put in the innkeeper.</p>

<p>"And what will Flora say?" something
whispered to Asriel, from a corner of his
overflowing heart. "Do you mean to tell
me that the American young lady will marry
this old-fashioned, pious fellow?" "Hold
your tongue, fool you!" Asriel snarled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
inwardly. "She will have to marry him,
and that settles it, and don't you disturb my
joy. It's for her good as well as for mine."</p>

<p>With a sudden movement he disengaged
his arms, and, taking off his enormous gold
watch and chain, he put it on Shaya, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wear it in good health, my child. This
is your first present from your sweetheart.
But wait till we come to America!"</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>The next morning Asriel visited the cemetery,
and was overawed by its size. While
living Pravly had increased by scarcely a
dozen houses, the number of dwellings in
silent Pravly had nearly doubled.</p>

<p>The headstones, mostly of humble size
and weatherworn, were a solemn minority in
a forest of plain wooden monuments, from
which hung, for identification, all sorts of
unceremonious tokens, such as old tin cans,
bottomless pots, cast-off hats, shoes, and
what not. But all this, far from marring
the impressiveness of the place, accentuated
and heightened the inarticulate tragedy of
its aspect. The discarded utensils or wearing
apparel seemed to be brooding upon the
days of their own prime, when they had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
participated in the activities of the living
town yonder. They had an effect of mysterious
muteness, as of erstwhile animated
beings,&mdash;comrades of the inmates of the
overgrown little mounds underneath, come
to join them in the eternal rest of the city
of death.</p>

<p>"Father! Father!" Asriel began, in a
loud synagogue intonation, as he prostrated
himself upon an old grave, immediately after
the cantor had concluded his prayer and
withdrawn from his side. "It is I, Asriel,
your son&mdash;do you remember? I have come
all the way from America to ask you to
pray for me and my child. She is a good
girl, father, and I am trying to lead her on
the path of righteousness. She is about to
marry the greatest scholar of God's Law
hereabouts. Do pray that the boy may find
favor in her eyes, father! You know, father
dear, that I am only a boor, and woe is me!
I am stuffed full of sins. But now I am
trying to make up and to be a good Jew.
Will you pray the Uppermost to accept my
penance?" he besought, with growing pathos
in his voice. "You are near Him, father,
so do take pity upon your son and see to it
that his sins are forgiven. Will you pray
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
for me? Will you? But, anyhow, I care
more for Flora&mdash;Bloome, her Yiddish name
is. What am I? A rusty lump of nothing.
But Flora&mdash;she is a flower. Do stand
forth before the High Tribunal and pray
that no ill wind blow her away from me,
that no evil eye injure my treasure. She
lost her mother when she was a baby, poor
child, and she is the only consolation I have
in the world. But you are her grandfather&mdash;do
pray for her!"</p>

<p>Asriel's face shone, his heavy voice rang
in a dismal, rapturous, devotional sing-song.
His eyes were dry, but his soul was full of
tears and poetry, and he poured it forth in
passionate, heart-breaking cadences.</p>

<p>"What is the difference between this
grass blade and myself?" he asked, a little
after. "Why should you give yourself airs,
Asriel? Don't kick, be good, be pious, carry
God in your heart, and make no fuss! Be
as quiet as this grass, for hark! the hearse
is coming after you, the contribution boxes
are jingling, the Angel of Death stands
ready with his knife&mdash;Oh, do pray for
your son, father!" he shrieked, in terror.</p>

<p>He paused. A bee, droning near by,
seemed to be praying like himself, and its
company stirred Asriel's heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
"Oh, father! I have not seen you for
thirty-five years. Thirty-five years!" he
repeated in deliberate tones and listening to
his own voice.</p>

<p>"We are the thirty-five!" some distant
tombstones responded, and Asriel could not
help pausing to look about, and then he
again repeated, "Thirty-five years! Can I
never see you again, father? Can't I see
your dear face and talk to you, as of old,
and throw myself into fire or water for you?
Can't I? Can't I? Do you remember how
you used to keep me on your knees or say
prayers with me at the synagogue, and box
my ears so that the black year took me when
you caught me skipping in the prayer-book?
Has it all flown away? Has it really?"</p>

<p>He paused as though for an answer, and
then resumed, with a bitter, malicious laugh
at his own expense: "Your father is silent,
Asriel! Not a word, even if you tear yourself
to pieces. All is gone, Asrielke! All,
all, all is lost forever!"</p>

<p>His harsh voice collapsed. His speech
died away in a convulsion of subdued sobbing.
His soul went on beseeching his
father to admit him to the restful sanctity
of his company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
When Asriel rose to his feet and his eye
fell upon a tombstone precisely like his
father's, he frowned upon it, with a sense of
jealousy. On his way to his mother's grave,
in the older part of the cemetery, he ever
and anon turned to look back. His father's
tombstone was rapidly becoming merged in
a forest of other monuments. His dead
father, his poor father, was losing his individuality,
till he was a mere speck in this
piebald medley of mounds, stones, boards,
and all sorts of waste. Asriel felt deeply
hurt. He retraced his steps till his father's
resting-place once more became the centre
of the world.</p>

<p>Then he went to pay his respects and tears
to the graves of his mother, sisters, brothers,
uncles. At last, completely exhausted, he
took to walking among the other headstones.
As he stopped to make out their Hebrew
inscriptions, he would now hang his head, in
heart-wringing reminiscence, now heave a
sigh, or clap his hands, in grievous surprise.</p>

<p>The tombstones and tomb-boards were
bathed in the reddish gold of the late afternoon
sun. Asriel had not yet broken his
fast, but although shattered in body and
spirit he felt no hunger and was reluctant to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
leave the graveyard. He found here more
of his contemporaries that he well remembered,
more of the Pravly of his time, than in
the town a verst or two away. The place
asserted a stronger claim upon him and held
him by the force of its unearthly fascination.</p>

<p>When he reached town at last, he felt
new-born. Pravly was again dear to his
heart, although Flora and America drew
him to them with more magnetism than
ever. He strove to speak in soft accents,
and went about the houses of his relatives
and the poor of the town, distributing various
sums and begging the recipients of his
gifts "to have pity and not to thank him,"
lest it should detract from the value of his
good deed.</p>

<p>Then he went to make peace with Reb
Lippe.</p>

<p>"You are going to stay here, so you can
get another prodigy," he pleaded humbly.
"But one cannot get such goods in America.
Besides, you can read Talmud yourself,
while I am only a boor, and what have I
done to make sure of my share in the world
to come? Here are three hundred rubles
for charity. Do forgive me, Reb Lippe, will
you? What will you lose by it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
There were others in the room, and the
unique pathos of the plea touched and
amused them at once. Reb Lippe was
moved to the point of tears. Moreover, the
present situation took the venom out of his
defeat.</p>

<p>"I forgive you with all my heart," he
said impulsively, patting "the boor" as he
would a child. "Be seated. May the Uppermost
bring you home in peace and bless
the union. There is another young man
who is worthy of my daughter; and Shaya&mdash;may
the Holy One&mdash;blessed be He&mdash;grant
him the will and the power to spread
His Law in America. The Jews there want
a young man like him, and I am glad he is
going with you. You are taking a precious
stone with you, Reb Asriel. Hold it dear."</p>

<p>"You bet I will," Asriel replied gleefully.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The nearer Asriel, with the prodigy in
tow, came to New York, the deeper did
Pravly sink into the golden mist of romance,
and the more real did the great American
city grow in his mind. Every mile added
detail to the picture, and every new bit of
detail made it dearer to his heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
He was going home. He felt it more
keenly, more thrillingly every day, every
hour, every minute.</p>

<p>Sandy Hook hove in sight.</p>

<p>Can there be anything more beautiful,
more sublime, and more uplifting than the
view, on a clear summer morning, of New
York harbor from an approaching ship?
Shaya saw in the enchanting effect of sea,
verdure, and sky a new version of his visions
of paradise, where, ensconced behind luxuriant
foliage, the righteous&mdash;venerable old
men with silvery beards&mdash;were nodding
and swaying over gold-bound tomes of the
Talmud. Yet, overborne with its looming
grandeur, his heart grew heavy with suspense,
and he clung close to Asriel.</p>

<p>All was bustle and expectation on board.
The little deck engines never ceased rumbling
and the passengers, spruced up as if
for church, were busy about their baggage,
or promenading with a festive, nervous air.</p>

<p>Asriel twitched and bit his lip in rapture.</p>

<p>"Oh, how blue the water is!" said Shaya
wistfully.</p>

<p>"America is a fine country, is it not?"
the old man rejoined. "But it can't hold
a candle to Flora. Wait till you see her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
You just try to be a good boy," he kept murmuring;
"stick to your Talmud, and don't
give a <i>peper</i> for anything else, and all God
has given me shall be yours. I have no son
to say <i>Kaddish</i> for my soul when I am
dead. Will you be my Kaddish, Shaya?
Will you observe the anniversary of my
death?" he queried, in a beseeching tone
which the young man had never heard from
him.</p>

<p>"Of course I will," Shaya returned, like
a dutiful child.</p>

<p>"Will you? May you live long for it.
In palaces will I house you, like the eye in
my head will I cherish you. I am only a
boor, but she is my daughter, my only child,
and my whole life in this world."</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>Asriel kept Flora unadvised as to the
name of the steamer or the date of his arrival.
Upon landing he did not go directly
to his residence, but first took his importation
into a large "clothing and gents' furnishing
store" on Broadway, from which
the <i>illoui</i> emerged completely transformed.
Instead of his uncouth cap and the draggling
coat which had hidden his top-boots
from view, he was now arrayed in the costliest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
"Prince Albert," the finest summer
derby, and the most elegant button-shoes
the store contained. This and a starched
shirt-front, a turned-down collar, and a
gaudy puff-tie set into higher relief the
Byronic effect of his intellectual, winsome
face.</p>

<p>Asriel snapped his fingers for delight.
He thought him easily the handsomest and
best-dressed man on Broadway. "It is the
Divine Presence shining upon him!" he
murmured to himself, dragging the young
man by the hand, as if he were a truant
schoolboy. Barring the prodigy's sidelocks
(badges of divine learning and piety), which
were tightly curled into two little cushions
in front of his ears, he now thought him
thoroughly Americanized.</p>

<p>The prodigy, however, felt tied and fettered
in the garb of Gentile civilization, and
as he trudged along by his convoy's side, he
viewed his transformed self in the store
windows, or stared, rabbit-like, at the lumbering
stage-coaches and the hurrying noblemen.</p>

<p>Asriel let himself and his charge in noiselessly
with the latchkey, which had accompanied
him, together with a bunch of other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
keys, on his tour. They entered the hallway
on tiptoe.</p>

<p>The little house rang with the voluminous
tones of Flora's piano, through which
trickled the doleful tremolo of her subdued
contralto. Since her father had left her
pining for his return, "Home, Sweet Home"
had become her favorite tune.</p>

<p>Flora was alone in the house, and her
unconscious welcome was all the sweeter to
Asriel's soul for the grieving note which
ran through it. His heart throbbed with
violence. Shaya's sank in awe. He had
never heard a piano except through the
window of some nobleman's house.</p>

<p>"Hush! Do you hear?" the old man whispered.
"That's your predestined bride."
With that he led the way downstairs.
There they paused to kiss the divine name
on the <i>Mezuzah</i> of the door-post.</p>

<p>"Tamara!" Asriel called, under his
breath, looking for the pious housekeeper in
the dining-room and in the kitchen. "She
is not in. Must be out marketing or about
her good deeds. A dear soul she! Oh, it's
her fast day; she fasts Mondays and Thursdays."</p>

<p>Then he stepped up in front of a tin box
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
that was nailed to one of the kitchen doors
and took out his pocket-book. It was one
of the contribution-boxes of the "Meyer-the-Wonder-worker
Fund," which is devoted
to the support of pious old European Jews
who go to end their days in the Land of
Israel. Every orthodox Jew in the world
keeps a similar box in his house and drops
a coin into it whenever he escapes some
danger. Asriel had safely crossed the wide
ocean, and his offering was a handful of
silver.</p>

<p>"Well, you stay here, Shaya, and don't
budge till you are called," he said; and
leaving the young man to his perplexity
he betook himself upstairs, to surprise his
daughter.</p>

<p>Flora burst into tears of joy, and hugged
him again and again, while he stroked her
black hair or stood scowling and grinning
for admiration.</p>

<p>"Ah, you dear, cranky papa!" she burst
out, for the fourth time realizing that he
was actually come back to her, and for the
fourth time attacking him.</p>

<p>At last he thought they had had enough.
He was dying to protract the scene, but
there was that troublesome job to get rid of,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
and Asriel was not the man to put such
things off. Whenever he felt somewhat
timid he would grow facetious. This was
the case at the present juncture.</p>

<p>"Well, Flora, guess what sort of present
your papa has brought you," he said, reddening
to his ears. "I'll bet you you won't
hit if you keep on guessing till to-morrow.
No girl has ever got such a present as long
as America is America."</p>

<p>Flora's eyes danced with joyous anticipation.
Her mind was ablaze with diamonds,
rubies, emeralds, sapphires, pearls.</p>

<p>"I have got a bridegroom for you&mdash;a
fifteen-thousand-dollar one. Handsomest and
smartest fellow on earth. He is an <i>illoui</i>."</p>

<p>"A what?" she asked, in amazement.</p>

<p>"Oh, a wonderful chap, you know, deep
in the Talmud and the other holy books.
He could knock all the rabbis of Europe to
smithereens. The biggest bug in Pravly
was after him, but I beat him clean out of
his boots. Shaya! Come right up!"</p>

<p>The girl gazed at her father in bewilderment.
Was he joking or was he in dead,
terrific earnest?</p>

<p>Shaya made his appearance, with his eyes
on the floor, and wringing the index finger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
of his right hand, as he was wont to do
whenever he felt ill at ease, which was seldom,
however.</p>

<p>Flora's brain was in a whirl.</p>

<p>"This is your predestined bridegroom,
my daughter. A fine present, is it not?
Did you ever expect such a raisin of a
sweetheart, hey? Well, children, I must
go around to see about the baggage. Have
a chat and be acquainted." With that
he advanced to the door.</p>

<p>"Papa! Papa!" Flora frantically called
to him. But he never turned his head and
went his way.</p>

<p>In her despair she rushed at the young
stranger, who was still wringing his finger, as
he stood in the middle of the parlor, eyeing
the carpet, and snapped out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mister, you had better go. If you think
you are going to be my bridegroom, you are
sadly mistaken."</p>

<p>She spoke in Yiddish, but her pronunciation,
particularly of the letter "r," was so
decidedly American that to Shaya it sounded
at once like his native tongue and the language
of Gentiles. However, it was Yiddish
enough, and the fact of this imposing young
lady speaking it gave him the feeling of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
being in the presence of a Jewish princess
of biblical times.</p>

<p>"Where shall I go? I don't know anybody
here." He said it with an air of
nave desperation which touched the girl's
heart. "Where is my fault?" he added
pleadingly.</p>

<p>She gave him a close look, and, taking
him by his clean-cut beardless chin, opened
her eyes wide at him, and broke into a hearty
laugh.</p>

<p>"My father has really brought you over
to marry me?" she questioned, for the first
time awakening to the humorous side of the
situation, and again she burst out laughing.</p>

<p>Shaya blushed and took hold of his finger,
but he forthwith released it and also broke
into a giggle. Her merriment set him at his
ease, and her labored Yiddish struck him as
the prattle of a child.</p>

<p>Flora was amused and charmed as with a
baby. Shaya felt as if he were playing with
another boy.</p>

<p>Of all the immigrants who had married
or were engaged to marry some of her girl
friends, none had, just after landing, been so
presentable, so sweet-faced, and so droll as
this scholarly-looking fellow. There would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
have been nothing odd in her marrying him
a year or two later, after he had picked up
some broken English and some of the customs
of the country. But then her mind
was firmly made up, and she had boasted to
her friends that she was bound to marry a
doctor, and here this boy was not even going
to be a business man, but an orthodox rabbi
or something of the sort. The word "rabbi"
was associated in her mind with the image
of an unkempt, long-skirted man who knew
nothing of the world, took snuff, and made
life a nuisance to himself and to others. Is
she going to be a <i>rabbitzen</i> (a rabbi's wife)?
No! No! No! Come what may, none but
a refined American gentleman shall lead her
under the nuptial canopy! And in her rage
she fled from the parlor and went to nurse
her misery on the dining-room lounge.</p>

<p>Presently, as she lay with her hands
clasped under her head, abandoned to her
despair and fury, and yet unable to realize
that it was all in real earnest, a fretting sensation
settled somewhere in her heart. At
first it was only like a grain of sand, but it
kept growing till it lay a heavy, unbearable
lump. She could not stand the idea of that
poor, funny dear being left alone and scared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
out of his wits. Still, she would not stir.
Let papa take him away or she will leave
the house and go to work in a factory.</p>

<p>"Tamara!" she suddenly raised herself to
say, the moment the housekeeper came into
the room. "There is a man upstairs. He
must be hungry."</p>

<p>"Then why don't <em>you</em> give him something
to eat?" Tamara responded tartly. "You
know it is Monday and I am faint. But
who is he and what is he doing upstairs?
Let him come down."</p>

<p>"Go and see him for yourself," snapped
Flora. "You will find him one of your set&mdash;a
Talmudical scholar, a pious soul," she
added, with a venomous laugh.</p>

<p>Tamara bent upon her a look full of resentment
as well as of devout reproach, and
betook herself upstairs.</p>

<p>When Asriel came he explained that
Shaya was not going to be a rabbi, nor
dress otherwise than as an American gentleman,
but that he would lead a life of piety
and spend his time studying the Talmud,
partly at home and partly at some synagogue.
"What, then, have I worked all my life for?"
he pleaded. "I am only a boor, my daughter,
and how long does a fellow live? Don't
darken my days, Flora."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
Tamara kept nodding pious assent. "In
the old country a girl like you would be glad
to marry such a child of the Law," she expostulated
with the girl. "It is only here
that we are sinners and girls marry none but
worldly men. May every daughter of Israel
be blessed with such a match."</p>

<p>"Mind your own business!" Flora exploded.
She understood her father's explanation
but vaguely, and it had the opposite
of the desired effect upon her.</p>

<p>"Leave her alone. The storm will blow
over," Asriel whispered.</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>When Asriel's baggage arrived it proved
to include a huge box full of Hebrew books.
They were of various sizes, but twenty-five
of them were large, uniform, leather-bound
folio volumes, portly and resplendent in a
superabundance of gilding and varnish. Of
these, twenty contained the whole of the
Babylonian Talmud together with the various
commentaries, the remaining five comprising
the Alphos. After a little a walnut
bookcase made its appearance. It was accorded
a place of honor in the front parlor,
and Asriel, Tamara, and Shaya busied themselves
with arranging the sacred books on
its shelves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
Flora sat eyeing them sarcastically, till,
sobs rising to her throat, she retired to the
seclusion of her bedroom, on the top floor,
and burst out crying as if her heart would
break. The contents of all those books,
which her father had imported as accessories
of her would-be bridegroom, were Chinese
to her. She had never seen so many
of them nor given a moment's attention to
the occasional talks which she had chanced
to overhear concerning such books and the
men who spent their lives reading them.
They now frightened her, as if they were
filled with weird incantations and Shaya
were the master of some uncanny art.</p>

<p>The prodigy was busy arranging his
library, now and then opening a book to
examine its print. Presently, as he was
squatting down before a chair upon which
he was turning over the leaves of a bulky
volume, his attention was arrested by a celebrated
passage. Without changing his posture,
he proceeded to glance it over, until,
completely absorbed, he fell to humming
the words, in that peculiar sing-song, accompanied
by indescribable controversial
gesticulations, which seem to be as indispensable
in reading Talmud as a pair of eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
"Look, look!" Tamara nudged Asriel,
whom she was helping to transfer the remaining
books to the marble table. Asriel
turned his head toward the prodigy, and
for a few moments the two stood staring at
the odd, inspiring spectacle with gaping admiration.
Then the housekeeper and her
employer exchanged a glance of intelligence,
she nodding her bewigged head piously, as
much as to say: "What a find Heaven has
placed in your way!"</p>

<p>"The Uppermost has blessed you," she
added in whispers.</p>

<p>"May he enjoy long life with us!" Asriel
returned, with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Flora does not know what a treasure
the Lord of the Universe has sent her."</p>

<p>"She will," he rejoined curtly.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>It was at the head of a dozen venerable
Talmudists, including the rabbi of the congregation,
that Asriel returned from the
synagogue next Saturday morning. The
learned company was entertained with wine,
cold fish, and some of the lemon pie and genuine
Yiddish pastry for which Tamara was
famous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
"Here is life, Mr. Stroon! Here is life,
Shaya!" each of the guests said, raising his
glass.</p>

<p>"Life and peace! Life and peace!" was
the uniform response.</p>

<p>"God bless the union and let them live a
hundred and twenty years," pursued Reb
Mendele, a little man with luxuriant red
sidelocks, as he reached for a piece of Sabbath
cake.</p>

<p>"And grant that they give birth to children
and bring them up to the Law, the
Bridal Canopy, and deeds of righteousness,"
chimed in another, whose ear-locks
were two sorry corkscrew-like appendages,
as he held up a slice of fish on the points of
his fork.</p>

<p>"And Shaya continue a child of the Law
and study it with never-failing zeal," came
from between a dangling pair of tubes.</p>

<p>"That's the point!" emphasized a chorus
of munching mouths.</p>

<p>"But where is the bride?" somebody
demanded. "She must show herself! she
must show herself!"</p>

<p>"That's right," Reb Mendele seconded
heartily. "Out with the bride! 'And the
daughters of Jerusalem come out dancing,'"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
he quoted; "'and what do they say? "Lift
thine eyes, young man, and behold the
maiden thou choosest. Do not set thine eye
on beauty, but"'"&mdash;He broke off abruptly,
reddening. The remainder of the
quoted passage runs as follows: "Set thine
eye (the maidens say to the young man)
on good family connections, as is written
in Proverbs: 'False is grace and vain is
beauty: a woman that feareth the Lord
shall indeed be praised.'" It would have
been anything but appropriate to the occasion,
and while the Chaldaic and the Hebrew
of the citation were Greek to Asriel, there
was the prodigy to resent it.</p>

<p>Another hoary-headed child of the Law
interposed: "'Go forth and look, O ye
daughters of Zion, on King Solomon, with
the crown wherewith his mother hath
crowned him on the day of his espousals,
and on the day of the joy of his heart.'
Saith the Talmud: 'By "the day of his espousals"
is meant the day of the Giving
of the Law.' Accordingly, when Shaya's
wedding takes place, if God be pleased, it
will be an espousal in the literal as well as
in the Talmudic sense, for is he not full of
Law? It will therefore be the Giving of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
the Law in marriage to Reb Asriel's daughter,
will it not?"</p>

<p>"Never mind blushing, Shaya," said the
rabbi, although the prodigy, engrossed with
the "paradise taste" of the lemon pie,&mdash;a
viand he had never dreamed of,&mdash;and keeping
a sharp eye on the dwindling contents
of the tart-dish, was too busy to blush.</p>

<p>Flora was in her bedroom, the place of
her voluntary exile most of the time that
her compulsory sweetheart was in the house.
Her father was kind and attentive to her, as
usual, and never mentioned Shaya's name
to her. But she knew that he was irrevocably
bent upon the marriage, and her mood
often verged on suicide. Could it really be
that after all her cherished dreams of afternoon
drives in Central Park, in a doctor's
buggy and with the doctor himself by her
side, she was doomed to be the wife of that
clumsy rustic, who did not even know how
to shake hands or to bow to a lady, and who
could not say a word without performing
some grotesque gesture or curling his horrid
sidelocks? Oh, what would the girls
say! She had twitted them on the broken
English of their otherwise worldly and comparatively
well-mannered sweethearts, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
now she herself was matched with that
wretch of a holy soul!</p>

<p>And yet Shaya was never in her mind invested
in the image of a "clumsy rustic"
nor of a "holy soul." Whenever she saw
him she would screw up a frown, but on
one occasion, when their eyes met across
the supper-table, they could not help smiling
to each other, like children at church.</p>

<p>"Flora dear, I want to speak to you,"
Asriel said, knocking at the locked door of
her hiding-place.</p>

<p>"Leave me alone, papa, will you? I've
got a headache," she responded.</p>

<p>"That's all right, but unlock the door.
I won't eat you up."</p>

<p>She was burning to have her father broach
the painful subject, so that she might have
it out with him. With that end in view,
she set her teeth and turned the key. But
Asriel came in so unaggressive, so meek, in
a pleading attitude so utterly unlike him,
that he took her by surprise, as it were, and
she stood completely disarmed.</p>

<p>"I beg you, my daughter, do not shorten
my days, and come downstairs," he entreated
with heartfelt ardor. "I have so
little to live, and the Uppermost has sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
me a piece of comfort so that I may die a
righteous Jew,&mdash;will you take it away from
me? Will you put me to shame before God
and man?"</p>

<p>The words and the pathos with which
they were delivered so oddly contrasted with
all she knew of her father that she felt as if
he were really praying for his life. She was
deeply touched and dazed, and before she
knew what she was about, found herself in
the crowded little dining-room below.</p>

<p>"Good Sabbath, Flora, good Sabbath!"
the venerable assemblage greeted her.</p>

<p>"Good Sabbath!" she returned, bowing
gracefully, and blushing.</p>

<p>"May your guest be pleasing to you,"
one of the company went on in time-honored
phrase; "and, if God be pleased, we shall
live to make merry at your wedding."</p>

<p>Flora's face turned a deeper red.</p>

<p>Several of the Talmudists were itching for
some banter at the expense of the young
pair, but the American girl's dignified bearing
and her commanding figure and dress
bore down every tendency in that direction,
so that the scholarly old gentlemen turned
their overflowing spirits in other channels.</p>

<p>"Give us some Law, Shaya!" said Reb
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Mendele, with a Talmudic wave of both
hands.</p>

<p>"That's right," the others concurred.
"Your prospective father-in-law is feasting
us upon fare of the earth, and it is meet
that you should regale us with Words of
Law."</p>

<p>Shaya, his face as red as Flora's, was eyeing
the tablecloth as he murmured,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'No conversing during repast.'"</p>

<p>"Words of Law are no converse," Reb
Mendele retorted.</p>

<p>"The Commentary adds: 'Not so much
as to quote the precept about silence during
repast,'" Shaya rejoined reluctantly, without
raising his eyes. "Now the precept is
Words of the Law, is it not? Which means
that the prohibition does extend to Words
of Law."</p>

<p>Apart from his embarrassment, the prodigy
was somehow loath to engage in a
spiritual discussion in the presence of the
stylish young lady.</p>

<p>"Why did you quote it then?" Reb
Mendele pursued aggressively. He referred
to two other passages, in support of his
position; and Shaya, with his eyes still on
the tablecloth, and refraining from all gesticulation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
could not help showing the irrelevance
of both. It was a "knock-out blow,"
but his red-bearded opponent cleverly extricated
himself from the ignominy of his defeat
by assuming an amused air, as if it had
all been mere bait to decoy the prodigy to a
display of his erudition and mental powers;
and retaining his smile against further
emergency, Reb Mendele hazarded another
assault. Some of the other Talmudists took
a hand. The battle waxed hot, though
Shaya, fighting single-handed against half a
dozen elders, remained calm, and parried
their blows with a shamefaced but contemptuous
look, never raising a finger nor his
eyes from the tablecloth. Once in the fray,
he would not have Flora see him get the
worst of it.</p>

<p>She, on her part, could not help a growing
interest in the debate, and finally accepted
the chair which Tamara had tenderly placed
by her side five minutes before. To be
sure, she understood not a word of the controversy.
To her it was something like a
boxing-match, with every exciting element
of the sport, but without any of its violence
(which alone kept Flora from attending
pugilistic performances), though the arms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
and fingers of our venerable combatants
were even more active than are the arms
and fists of two athletes in a modern ring.
As she watched the progress of the discussion
she became conscious of a decided partisan
feeling in favor of the younger man.
"It ain't fair a bit!" she said to herself.
"Six old-timers against one boy&mdash;I declare!"</p>

<p>Asriel and Tamara, to both of whom the
contest was as unintelligible as it was to
Flora, were so abandoned to their admiration
of the youthful disputant that they
omitted to notice the girl's undisguised
interest in the scene and to congratulate
themselves upon it. The host followed the
controversy with a sheepish look of reverence,
as if the company were an assemblage
of kings. The housekeeper looked on with
a beaming face, and every time one of the
patriarchs made a bold attack, she would
nod her head as if she understood it all,
and conceded the strength of his contention.</p>

<p>Egged on by Flora's presence as well as
by the onslaughts of his adversaries, Shaya
gradually warmed up to the debate, until,
having listened, with sardonic patience, to a
lengthy and heated argument by a fleshy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
child of the Law, he suddenly leaped upon
his man.</p>

<p>"Is this the way you understand the passage?"
he shouted, with a vicious chuckle.
Then, thrusting his curly head in his opponent's
face, and savagely gesticulating, he
poured forth a veritable cataract of the
most intricate syllogisms and quotations.</p>

<p>It was quite a new Shaya. His blue eyes
flashed fire, his whole countenance gleamed,
his sing-song rang with tuneful ferocity.</p>

<p>"But it seems to me that Rabbi Yohanon
does not say that," the portly Talmudist
objected. "I am afraid you have misquoted
him."</p>

<p>It was the drowning man's straw. Even
Flora, who understood the Yiddish of the
retort, could see that; and her heart bounded
with cruel delight.</p>

<p>"Have I? You are sure, are you?" Shaya
demanded, with boyish virulence. "All
right. We shall see!" With which he
darted out of the room and upstairs.</p>

<p>"The boy is a <em>gaon</em>,"<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> the corpulent old
man remarked humbly. "What a head!
What a memory, what a <em>chariff</em>!"<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>"Yes, and what a <em>bokki</em>!"<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> chimed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
the rabbi. "One cannot help wondering
when he had time to study up so much."</p>

<p>"He'll just take a peep at a book and
then he knows it all by heart," put in Asriel.
"He licked all the rabbis around Pravly."</p>

<p>The boorish remark disposed some of the
listeners to laugh, but they did not.</p>

<p>"You have got a treasure, Mr. Stroon,"
said Reb Mendele.</p>

<p>"You bet!" the host answered with a
blissful simper, as he took to stroking his
daughter's hair.</p>

<p>"You know what the Talmud says, Mr.
Stroon?" resumed the rabbi. "That he
who supports a scholar of the Law is like
unto him who offers sacrifices."</p>

<p>"I know," Asriel returned exultingly.
At the Pravly synagogue the preacher had
applied the same quotation to Reb Lippe.</p>

<p>Presently Shaya returned with a pile of
huge volumes in his arms. His citation
proved correct, and meeting with no further
opposition, but too far carried away by the
subject to quit it so soon, he volunteered an
extemporaneous discourse. His face was
now wrapped in genial, infantile ecstasy
and his intonation was a soft, impassioned
melody. The old man followed him with
paternal admiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
When he concluded and leaned back in
his chair, he gave Flora a triumphant smile.
The color mounted to her cheeks and she
dropped her gaze. At the same moment
Asriel flung himself upon the young hero.</p>

<p>"Oh, you dear little sparrow!" he exclaimed,
lifting Shaya in his arms like a
baby, and passionately kissing him.</p>

<p>Tamara wiped her eyes with her apron.
Flora had a mind to flee for safety, but she
forthwith saw herself out of danger, for her
father seemed unmindful of her presence,
and the first thing he did as he let the prodigy
down was to invite his guests upstairs
to show them the newly imported library.</p>

<p>As the patriarchal company was filing out
of the dining-room, Shaya, passing by Flora,
said to her gleefully:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I gave it to them, didn't I?"</p>

<p>"Tell me now," said Tamara, when the
two women found themselves alone in the
room; "ought you not to thank God for
such a treasure of a sweetheart?"</p>

<p>"He is nothing of the kind to me," Flora
burst out, "and he never will be, either. I
don't care how long papa is going to keep
him in the house."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>"Oh, papa!" sobbed Flora; "will you
ever put an end to it? You know I'll never
marry him."</p>

<p>"Do I compel you to?" he replied.
"What do you care if he is in the house? He
does not take away your dinner, does he?
Imagine that he is your brother and don't
bother your head about him. The boy has
become so dear to me that I feel as if he
were my own son. Will <em>you</em> recite Kaddish
for my soul? Will you play for me at the
anniversary of my death? God thought I
was not good enough to have a son, but he
sent me this holy child to take the place of
one. As I hear him read his holy books," he
went on, with mounting pathos, "it melts
like ice-cream in my heart. It pleased the
Uppermost to make a boor of your papa.
Well, I suppose He knows his business, and
I am not going to poke my nose in, and ask
questions; but He seems to have taken pity
on me after all, and in my old age he has
sent me an angel, so that I may get the
credit of supporting him. Did you hear what
the wise men said? That to support a man
who does nothing but study sacred books
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
is as good as offering sacrifices. Yes, my
daughter, God has put this boy in my hands;
He sent me all the way to Pravly for him&mdash;all
to give me a chance to make up for my
sins. Do you want me to kick him out?
Not if New York turned upside down."</p>

<p>"But, father"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hold on! Let me talk the heart out of
myself. It's no use asking me to send him
away. He is God's gift. He is as holy as
a Purity (the scrolls of the Law). You are
my daughter, and he is my son. I don't
chase you under the bridal canopy with a
strap, do I? If God does not wish the
match, it won't come off, that's all."</p>

<p>The conversation took place about a fortnight
after the great debate. Asriel lived
in the hope that when Shaya had learned
some English and the ways of Flora's circle,
she would get to like him. He could not
see how it was possible to withstand the
charms of the young man whom he sincerely
thought the handsomest fellow in the Jewish
colony. He provided him with a teacher,
and trusted the rest to time and God.</p>

<p>"Just fix him up in English and a little
figuring, and that's all," he instructed the
teacher. "But mind you, don't take him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
too far into those Gentile books of yours.
He does not want any of the monkey tricks
they teach the children at college. Do you
understand?"</p>

<p>Flora was getting used to Shaya's presence
in the house, as if he actually were a newly
discovered brother of hers, brought up in a
queer way which she could not understand,
and it was only occasionally and at growing
intervals that the situation would burst upon
her, and she would plead with her father as
she had done.</p>

<p>The two young people frequently found
themselves alone. The door between the
front parlor, which was now Shaya's study,
and Flora's boudoir was most of the time
open. They often talked together, and she
quizzed him about his manners, and once
or twice even went over his English lessons
with him, laughing at his mispronunciations,
and correcting them in the imposing
manner of her former school-teachers.</p>

<p>"Why do you work your fingers like
that?" she once said, with a pained look.
"Can't you try and read without them?"</p>

<p>"I am used to it from the Talmud-he-he-he!"
he tittered, as if acknowledging a
compliment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
Her piano did not disturb him in his
studies, for in the synagogues, where he had
grown up, he had been used to read in a
turmoil of other voices; but he loved the
instrument, and he would often pause to listen
to Flora's energetic strokes through the
door. When the tune was a melancholy one
its first accords would make him start, with
a thrill; and as he proceeded to listen his
heart would contract with a sharp feeling of
homesickness, and at the same time he would
be longing for still more familiarity in the
performer's manner toward him. Sometimes
he would cross over to her room and quietly
stand behind her while she was playing.</p>

<p>"Ah, it is so nice!" he once said, feeling
himself in a paradise on earth.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" she exclaimed,
facing about toward him, in affected
surprise. "Music ain't for a 'holy child'
like yourself." She mocked a favorite expression
of her father's.</p>

<p>"Don't say that," he reproached her.
"You always like to tease me. Why don't
I tease you?"</p>

<p>Upon the whole, Shaya took the situation
quite recklessly. He studied his Talmud
and his English, let Tamara cloy him with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
all sorts of tidbits, and roamed about the
streets and public buildings. In less than
six months he knew the city and its suburbs
much better than Flora, and could tell the
meaning of thousands of printed English
words, although he neither knew how to use
them himself nor recognized them in the
speech of others. Flora was amazed by his
rapid progress, and the facility with which
he mastered his Arithmetic and English
Grammar&mdash;in neither of which she had
been strong at school&mdash;even piqued her
ambition. It was as if she had been beaten
by the "holy soul" on her own ground.</p>

<p>The novelty of studying things so utterly
out of his rut was like a newly discovered
delicacy to his mental palate. He knew by
heart a considerable part of the English
translation in his Hebrew prayer-book and
Old Testament, and his greatest pleasure,
when Asriel was not about, was to do arithmetical
problems. But the problems were
all child's play to him, and he craved some
higher grade of intellectual food in the same
Gentile line. This he knew from his Talmud
to be contained in the "Wisdom of
Measuring," which he had learned of his
teacher to call Geometry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
"Bring me a Geometry, please," he whispered
to his instructor.</p>

<p>"I will, but don't say a word to Mr.
Stroon about it."</p>

<p>The forbidden fruit was furnished, and
the prodigy of sacred lore applied himself
to it with voracity.</p>

<p>"How cunning!" he said to the teacher,
in a transport of enthusiasm. "Of course,
it is not as deep as Talmud, but I never
dreamed there were such subtle things in
the Gentile books at all&mdash;may I be ill if I
did."</p>

<p>"This is only the beginning of it,"
the other returned, in whispered exultation.
"Wait till you get deeper into it. And
then there are other books, far more interesting."</p>

<p>"Say, young fellow!" Asriel said to
Shaya's teacher a week or so later; "you
need not trouble your righteous legs to
bring you here any more. You are getting
too thick with the boy."</p>

<p>Shaya now found no difficulty in plodding
through the theorems and problems unaided.
But he yearned after his teacher and friend,
and for several days could relish neither
his Talmud nor his contraband Geometry.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
He grew restless. His soul was languishing
with thirst.</p>

<p>"Guess where I have been," he confidentially
said to Flora, coming from the street
one afternoon. He spoke in Yiddish, and
she answered in English, interspersed with
the same dialect.</p>

<p>"Not in the synagogue, studying?" she
queried.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;at the Astor Library," he whispered.
"They have such a lot of books
there, Flora! Upstairs and downstairs&mdash;large
rooms like rich synagogues, with
shelves all over the walls, and all full of
books. Have you ever been there, Flora?"</p>

<p>"N-no!" she owned, with reluctance. The
"holy soul" was clearly forging ahead of
her in a world which she considered all her
own; and she hated the idea of it, and liked
it at the same time. "What did you
there?"</p>

<p>"I just looked at the books&mdash;oh, what a
lot!&mdash;and then I found out how to get a
Geometry,&mdash;they have everything in the
world, I tell you,&mdash;and I did some problems.
Don't tell your father I was there."</p>

<p>"Of course I won't," she said intimately.
"Can ladies come in?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
"Certainly; they have a separate place
for them, though; will you go there with
me?"</p>

<p>"Some day," she rejoined evasively.</p>

<p>"Will you? Oh, it's so nice to be sitting
and reading there! Only you must sit still.
I forgot myself, and as I was figuring out
some nice point, I began to reason aloud, so
a fine old gentleman stepped up to my side
and touched me on the shoulder. Oh, I got
so scared, Flora! But he did not do me anything&mdash;may
I be ill if he did. He only
told me to be quiet."</p>

<p>Flora burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"I'll bet you, you was singing in that
funny way you have when you are studying
the Talmud."</p>

<p>"Yes," he admitted joyfully.</p>

<p>"And working your hands and shaking
the life out of yourself," she pursued,
mimicking his gestures.</p>

<p>"No, I was not&mdash;may I not live till to-morrow
if I was," he protested vehemently,
with a touch of resentment. "Oh, it is so
nice to be there! I never knew there were
so many Gentile books in the world at all.
I wonder what they are all about. Only
I am so troubled about my English." He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
interrupted himself, with a distressed air.
"When I asked them for the book, and how
to get it, they could not understand me."</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> can understand everything you say
when you speak English. You're all right,"
she comforted him. His troubled, childlike
smile and his shining clear blue eyes, as he
spoke, went to her heart.</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> can, but other people can't. I so
wish I could speak it like you, Flora. Do
read a page or two with me, will you? I'll
get my Reader&mdash;shall I?"</p>

<p>"What's your hurry? Can't you wait?"</p>

<p>He could not wait. He was in a fever of
impatience to inhale the whole of the Gentile
language&mdash;definitions, spelling, pronunciation,
and all&mdash;with one desperate effort. It
was the one great impediment that seemed
to stand between him and the enchanted new
world that had revealed itself to him.</p>

<p>"Oh, do hear me read&mdash;may you live
long, Flora! It somehow draws mo as with
a kind of impure force. Will you?"</p>

<p>"All right," she yielded, with kindly curiosity
at the fervor of his request, and feeling
flattered.</p>

<p>He had been reading perhaps a quarter of
an hour when he grew absent-minded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
"You must have skipped a line again,"
she said, in an awkward undertone.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!"</p>

<p>They were seated at a respectful distance,
with the corner of the marble table between
them, her full, well-modeled bust erect and
stately against the pier-glass. She wore a
waist of dark-blue silk, trimmed with red,
and there was a red ribbon in her shock
of inky hair. Presently she leaned forward
to see a mispronounced word for herself.
Their heads found themselves close together.
Her ivory cheek almost touched his.</p>

<p>"Where is it?" she questioned, under
her breath.</p>

<p>He made no reply. His glance was riveted
to her raven eyelashes. A dash of scarlet
lurking under her chin dazed his brain.
After a slight pause he said, as he timidly
stroked her burning cheek:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is so smooth!"</p>

<p>She had an impulse to withdraw her face,
but felt benumbed. He went on patting
her, until, meeting with no resistance, his
lips touched her cheek, in a gingerly kiss.
Both lowered their eyes. They were silent,
but their hearts, each conscious of the other's
beatings, throbbed wildly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
"Bad boy!" she then whispered, without
raising her head.</p>

<p>After another silence, as their eyes met,
they burst into a subdued, nervous titter.</p>

<p>"You must not do that again," she said.
"Is this the kind of pious man you are?"</p>

<p>"Don't say that, Flora&mdash;pray don't. You
know it hurts my feelings when you speak
like that," he implored her. And impelled
by the embarrassed, affectionate sadness of
her mien, he seized her hand and fell to
kissing first her fingers and then her eyes,
as though beseeching them to reveal the
meaning of their sombre look. Their lips
met and clung together in a trance of passion.
When they parted Shaya felt ten
years older, and as his eye fell upon the
bookcase, he wondered what those glittering,
massive tomes were doing there.</p>

<p>"Will you tell your father that you want
to be my sweetheart?" he asked after
a while.</p>

<p>His voice and his features appeared to her
in a novel aspect.</p>

<p>"How do you know I do?" she said, with
playful defiance, hiding a burst of admiration
which was lost upon the unworldly
young man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
"Why&mdash;don't you?" he demanded solicitously.</p>

<p>Then, a sudden light of inspiration coming
in her eyes, Flora said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hol' on! How would you like to be a
doctor, Shayie?"</p>

<p>"But your father would turn me out if I
began to study for it."</p>

<p>She grew thoughtful. "But suppose he
had no objection?" she queried, her bashfulness
suddenly returning to her face.</p>

<p>"Oh, then I should be dying to study
doctor books&mdash;any kind of Gentile books
you wanted me to, Flora. But Reb Asriel
won't let me."</p>

<p>"Listen! Can you keep a secret?" she
asked like a conspiring little schoolgirl.</p>

<p>"You mean about your being my sweetheart?"</p>

<p>"No!" she rejoined impatiently. "I
mean the other thing&mdash;your studyin'. Papa
needn't get wind of it till it's too late&mdash;you
understand? If you are smart, we can fix
that."</p>

<p>"That's all right. I am awful clever at
keeping a secret," he boasted.</p>

<p>"Well, I want you to be a doctor, Shayie,"
she resumed, with matronly tenderness. "If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
you are, I'll care for you, and you'll be my
birdie boy, an' all; if not, you won't. Oh,
won't it be lovely when everybody knows
that you go to college and study together
with nice, educated up-town fellows! We
would go to theatres together and read different
books. You'll make a daisy of a
college boy, too&mdash;you bet. Would you like
to wear a high hat, and spec's, and ride in a
buggy, with a little nigger for a driver?&mdash;would
you, would you, bad boy, you? Hello,
Doctor Golub! How are you?"</p>

<p>She presented her lips, and they kissed
again and again.</p>

<p>"You know what, Shayie? When papa
comes I'll go out somewheres, so you can
tell him&mdash;you know what I mean. It'll
make it so much easier to fool him. Will
you tell him?"</p>

<p>"I am ashamed."</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> won't tell him."</p>

<p>"Don't be angry&mdash;I will. I shall always
do everything you tell me, Flora," he said,
looking into her black gleaming eyes,&mdash;"always,
always!" And in the exuberance
of his delight he once again felt himself a
little boy, and broke out into a masterly imitation
of the crow of a cock, jumping up and
flapping his arms for a pair of wings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
When Asriel and Shaya were alone in
the parlor, the young man said, as he fell to
wringing his index finger,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Flora wants me to tell you that she is
satisfied."</p>

<p>"Satisfied with what?" the old man demanded,
leaping to his feet.</p>

<p>"To be my sweetheart."</p>

<p>"Is she? Did she say so? When?&mdash;Tamara!"
he yelled, rushing downstairs and
dragging the prodigy along,&mdash;"Tamara!
May you live long! The Uppermost has
taken pity upon me after all. Floraly<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> has
come around&mdash;blessed be the Uppermost."</p>

<p>"Blessed be the Uppermost!" Tamara
echoed, her pleasant, swarthy face beaming
with heartfelt delight. "When He wills,
walls of iron must give way. It is a divine
match&mdash;any one can see it is. May they
live a hundred and twenty years together.
Mazol-tov!"<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>"Mazol-tov to you and to all of us,"
Asriel responded. "But where is Flora?
Fetch some drink, Tamara."</p>

<p>He stepped up to the "Wonder-worker
box," and deposited a silver coin for the
support of the pilgrims at Palestine, saying
as he did so:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
"I thank and praise thee, O Lord of the
Universe, for thy mercy toward me. Mayest
Thou grant the children long years, and
keep up in Shaya his love for thy sacred
Law. You know the match is all of your
own making, and you must take care of it.
I am only your slave, that's all."</p>

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>"Is Shayaly in?" inquired old Asriel
on entering Flora's room one morning in
midsummer. It was four months after his
daughter's betrothment to the Talmudist
had been celebrated by a solemn ceremony
and a sumptuous feast, the wedding having
been set for a later date. The crowning
glory of his achievement Stroon postponed,
like a rare bottle of wine, for some future
day. He dreaded to indulge himself in
such a rapid succession of This World joys
lest he might draw upon his Share in the
World-to-come. Will the Uppermost let
him live to see his daughter and the "holy
child," standing side by side under the Canopy?
Asriel was now confident that He
would. "Is Shayaly in?"</p>

<p>"Of course he is&mdash;papa," Flora answered,
raising her face from her book. Her "papa"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
was added aloud, and as if upon after-thought.</p>

<p>The parlor door stood ajar. Asriel stationed
himself near by and listened to the
young man's habitual sing-song. The old
man's face gradually became radiant with
bliss.</p>

<p>"My crown, my Messiah, my Kaddish!
My Share in the World-to-come!" he muttered.</p>

<p>"Did you have breakfast, papa?" Flora
demanded, speaking still louder than before.</p>

<p>At this moment Shaya's sing-song broke
out with fresh enthusiasm and his Hebrew
words became distinct. Asriel waved her
away fiercely. After a little he remarked
in a subdued voice, as he pointed to the
front parlor,&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>This</em> is my breakfast. This is for the
soul, my child; the worms of the grave cannot
touch it, and you take it along to the
other world. Everything else is a lot of
rubbish."</p>

<p>He made to leave, but could not help
pausing, in fresh admiration, and then,
softly opening the parlor door he entered
the sanctum, on tiptoe, in order to feast
his eye as well as his ear on the thrilling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
scene. He found Shaya rapturously swaying
and singing over a Talmud volume. Flora
watched her father with roguish delight.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I must not be gloating over
him like this," Asriel rebuked himself in his
heart. "I may give him the evil eye."
When he regained the back parlor he said,
under his breath: "Floraly, I am afraid
your company may disturb him sometimes.
A pretty sweetheart is apt to stir a fellow's
brains, you know, and take him away from
the Law. He had better study more at the
synagogues."</p>

<p>The girl blushed to her charcoal hair and
dropped her glance. But her father had
scarcely gained his room, on the floor above,
when she flew into the front parlor with a
ringing giggle.</p>

<p>"Now you can go right on, dearie," she
said, encircling Shaya's neck with one arm,
and producing with the other an English
textbook on Natural Philosophy, which had
lain open under the huge Hebrew volume.</p>

<p>"You heard me holler, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Of course I did," Shaya answered beamingly.
"He interrupted me in the middle
of such a cunning explanation!"</p>

<p>"Did he? What was it about? All
about sounds&mdash;the same as before?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
"Yes, but it is even more brainy than
what I told you."</p>

<p>He proceeded to expound, in Yiddish,
what he had been reading on Acoustics, she
listening to his enthusiastic popularization
with docile, loving inattention.</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>The young man made a pretense of spending
his afternoons, and sometimes also mornings,
at the various synagogues of the
Jewish quarter. His proud guardian encouraged
this habit, in order that his
"daughter's bridegroom" might disseminate
his sacred knowledge among other congregations
than his own. "Your learning
is the gift of God, Shayaly," he would say,
"and you needn't be ashamed to peddle it
around. Reb Lippe said America wanted
a man like you to spread the holy Law here.
Go and do it, my son, and the Uppermost
will help us all for your sake."</p>

<p>The prodigy and his importer were the
talk of the orthodox colony, and nothing
was more pleasing to Asriel than to hear
the praises of his daughter's fianc sounded
by the Talmudists. There came a time, however,
when, in his own synagogue, at least,
these encomiums ceased. Asriel missed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
them keenly and pestered the learned men
of the congregation with incessant talks
about Shaya, for the purpose of worrying
out some acknowledgment of his phenomenal
talents. But the concession was
mostly made in a half-hearted way, and
poor Asriel would be left hungrier than
ever. Particularly was his heart longing
for the warm eulogies of Reb Tzalel, a poor,
sickly old peddler, who was considered one
of the most pious and learned men in the
neighborhood. Asriel liked the man for
his nervous sincerity and uncompromising
self-respect. He often asked him to his
house, but the tattered, underfed peddler
invariably declined the invitation.</p>

<p>"What will I do there, Reb Asriel?" he
would say, with the pained sort of smile
which would light up his ghastly old face
whenever he spoke. "Look at your costly
carpet and furniture, and bear in mind that
you are a landlord and I a poor peddler!
At the synagogue I like you better, for here
we are equals. Saith the verse in the Book
of Job: 'Whereas He is one that shows no
favor to chieftains, and distinguishes not
the rich before the indigent, for all of them
are the work of his hands.'" Reb Tzalel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
translated the verse into Yiddish for the
benefit of his listener, whereupon Asriel felt
a much wealthier man than he was, and at
the same time he had a sense of humiliation,
as though his money were something to be
ashamed of.</p>

<p>This man's unusual reticence on the point
of Shaya's merits chagrined Asriel sorely,
and his mind even began to be troubled by
some vague misgivings on that score.</p>

<p>One evening Asriel sat by Reb Tzalel's
side in the study rooms of his synagogue.
It was in the latter part of November, and
Shaya's wedding was to take place during
the Feast of Hanuccah, some few weeks
later. The evening services, which on week
days were held in these rooms, were over,
and the "learners" could now give themselves
to their divine studies undisturbed,
save for the possible and unwelcome advent
of some belated Ten Worshipers. The two
spacious, dingy rooms, their connecting doors
wide open, were dimly lighted with candles
placed upon the plain long deal tables ranged
against their discolored walls. The open
bookcases were filled with dilapidated old
volumes, many more being in use or strewn
about, in chaotic heaps, on the tables,
benches, or window-sills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
In one room, around one of the long
tables, were gathered the members of the
daily Mishnah class. There were about a
dozen of them, mostly poor peddlers or
artisans,&mdash;a humble, seedy, pitiable lot,
come after a hard day's work or freezing,
to "take a holy word into their mouths."
Hardly one of these was up to the Gemarah
part of the Talmud, and even the Mishnah
only few could brave single-handed. They
sat at their open books following their voluntary
teacher, a large, heavy, middle-aged
man,&mdash;a mass of unkempt beard, flesh, and
rags, ablaze with the intellectual fury of
his enormous black eyes. He was reading
aloud, with ferocious appetite, swaying and
jerking his disheveled bulk, as he ever and
anon tossed up his head to interpret the
Mishna to his pupils, and every little while
breaking off in the middle of a sentence, or
even a word, to let his class shout the other
half as a guaranty of proficiency. Some of
his listeners plodded along the lines of their
books, in humble silence, with their index
fingers for fescues; the brighter ones boldly
interrupted the ponderous man, joyously
anticipating his explanations or pointing
out some discrepancy; one old dissembler
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
repeated unintelligible half-sentences with
well-acted gusto; another little old fellow
betrayed the fog in his mind by timid nods
of assent, while still another was bravely
kept from dozing off on his holy book by
frequent neighborly nudges from the man
next him. Standing behind the members
of the class were some envying "boors,"
like our poor Asriel, to whom even the
Mishnah was a luxury beyond their intellectual
means.</p>

<p>One of the long tables in the adjoining
room was covered with the open folios of the
daily Gemarah class,&mdash;some fifteen men of
all ages and economical conditions from the
doddering apple-vender, to whom the holy
books are the only source of pleasure in this
life as well as in the other, to the well-fed,
overdressed young furniture-dealer, with
whom the Talmud is a second nature, contracted
in the darker days of his existence
in Russia. There were several "keen
brains" in the group, and a former "prodigy"
or two, like Shaya. The class needed
no guide, but one old man with a boyish
face framed in snow-white hair, and wearing
a sea of unstarched linen collar about his
emaciated neck, was their chosen reader.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
He also left many sentences unuttered, but
he did it merely because he thought them
too well-known to need repetition. Whenever
he had something to add to the text, he
would address himself to the man by his
side, snapping his fingers at him genially,
and at times all but pinching him for ecstasy.
The others participated now by a twirl of a
finger, now by the swift repetition of a whole
syllogism, now by an indescribable system
of gestures, enacting, in dumb show, the
whole logical process involved in a nice
point. All at once the whole class would
burst into a bedlam of voices and gesticulations.
When the whirlwind of enthusiasm
subsided, it might be followed by a bit of
pleasantry,&mdash;from the exuberance of good
spirits at having got the better of a difficult
point,&mdash;and, upon the whole the motley
company looked like a happy family at the
Sabbath table.</p>

<p>The other long tables in both rooms were
occupied by <i>lomdim</i> (learned men), each intent
upon the good deed of studying "for
study's sake" by himself: some humming to
their musty folios melodiously; others smiling
and murmuring to them, like a fond
mother to her babe; still others wailing or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
grumbling or expostulating with their books,
or slapping them and yelling for delight, or
roaring like a lion in a cage. A patriarch
teaching his ten-year-old grandson and both
shouting at the top of their voices, in an entanglement
of pantomime; a swarthy little
grammar-school boy going it on his own
hook over a volume bigger than himself;
a "fine householder" in reduced circumstances
dignifiedly swinging his form and
twirling his sidelock as if he were confiding
a secret to his immense golden beard; one or
two of the hollow-voiced <i>prooshim</i>, who had
come to America in search of fortune, but
who were now supported by the congregation
for giving all their time to "the law
and the service;" a knot of men engaged
in a mixed discussion of "words of law"
and "words of every-day life"&mdash;all these
voices and murmurs mingled in one effervescence
of the sublime and the ridiculous,
with tragedy for a keynote,&mdash;twenty centuries
thrown pell-mell in a chaos of sound
and motion.</p>

<p>Asriel could have lived on the spectacle,
and although unable to participate in it himself,
he now, since the advent of the prodigy,
looked upon it as a world in which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
was not without a voice. He was seated in
a remote corner of the Gemarah room,
now watching the noisy scenes with open-mouthed
reverence, now turning to admire
Reb Tzalel by his side. The cadaverous face
and burning eyes of the peddler were sneering
at the drab-colored page before him;
while his voice sounded melancholy, like a
subdued bugle call.</p>

<p>Presently Reb Tzalel paused, and the two
engaged in converse. As Asriel was boasting
of Shaya's genius and kindliness of
disposition, vainly courting his friend for
a word of assent, the peddler, suddenly reddening
in the face, interrupted him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What's the use of playing cat and rat,
Mr. Stroon?" he burst out with his ghastly
smile. "I may as well tell you what lies
like a heavy stone on my heart. Your
Shaya is going to the bad. He is an <em>appikoros</em>."<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>"An appikoros!" Asriel demanded, as
if the word had suddenly acquired a new
meaning.</p>

<p>"Yes, an appikoros, and a Jeroboam the
son of Nebat&mdash;he sins, and leads others
to sin," the Talmudist declared tartly. "I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
hated to cause you the pain, Mr. Stroon,
but he has gone too far in Gentile books,
and when he is here and you are not about
he talks to everybody he can get hold of
concerning the way the world swings around
the sun, how rain and thunder, day and
night&mdash;everything&mdash;can be explained as a
matter of common sense, and that there is
no God in heaven, and all that sort of vile
stuff that you hear from every appikoros&mdash;may
they all be hurled from one end of the
world to the other! Everything can be explained&mdash;may
the Angel of Death explain
it to them, may they"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hold on, Reb Tzalel!" Asriel shouted:</p>

<p>"You need not curse him: you don't feed
him, do you? And what you say is a lie!&mdash;as
big a lie as Og the King of Bashan!"
he concluded with calm ferocity, raising his
burly figure from the bench.</p>

<p>"A lie, is it? Very well, then&mdash;you
shall know all. Little Mendele saw your
imported decoration smoking a cigarette
last Sabbath."</p>

<p>"Shaya smoke on the Sabbath!" Asriel
echoed. The practical, concrete nature of
this sin came home to him with a more
forceful blow than all the peddler had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
said about Shaya's ungodly theories. "Begone!"
the surrounding chaos seemed to
say to the "boor." "From now on you
have nothing to do here!"</p>

<p>"Shaya smoke a cigarette on the Sabbath!"
he repeated. "Well, and I have
this to say, that Mendele, and yourself,and
the whole lot of you are nothing but a set of
first-class liars and begrudging gossip-mongers.
It must give him a belly-ache to think
that he could not afford such a bridegroom
for his girl and that I could. Well, I have
got a prodigy for my daughter and he has
licked the whole lot of you learned fellows
to ground coffee. I have got him,&mdash;see?&mdash;and
let all my enemies and the boy's
enemies burst for envy." He clicked his
tongue and snapped his fingers, and for a
moment stood glaring witheringly at his interlocutor.</p>

<p>"Well, I am not going to argue with a
boor," said Reb Tzalel, in utter disgust.</p>

<p>His words were drowned in the noise, but
the "boor" reached Asriel's ear and touched
him on the raw. "Shut up, Reb Tzalel!"
he said, paling.</p>

<p>"Why should I? This is not your
house. It is God's dwelling. Here I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
richer than you. I only wanted to say that
it is not you I pity. You have been a boor,
and that's what you are and will be. But
the boy was about to become a great man in
Israel, and you have brought him over here
for bedeviled America to turn him into an
appikoros. Woe! woe! woe!"</p>

<p>"Keep still, Reb Tzalel; take pity," Asriel
implored, in a squeaking voice. "Don't
spill any salt over my wounds. Forgive me,&mdash;you
know I am a boor. Do take pity
and say no more; but all you have said&mdash;they
have said&mdash;is a lie&mdash;the cholera
choke me if it is not." And gasping for
breath, he ran out of the synagogue.</p>

<p>When he found himself in the street he
was conscious of some terrific blow having
just been dealt him, but did not clearly realize
its full meaning; and what had transpired
a minute before, between him and Reb
Tzalel, seemed to have occurred in the remote
past. The clamor of the street peddlers,
and the whole maze of squalor and
noise through which he was now scurrying,
he appeared to hear and to view at a great
distance, as if it all were on the other side
of a broad river, he hurrying on his lonely
way along the deserted bank opposite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
"An appikoros! an appikoros!" he said
to himself, vainly trying to grasp the meaning
of the word which he knew but too well.
"An appikoros, smoking on the Sabbath!"
The spectacle smote him in cold blood.
"Shaya smoke on the holy Sabbath! It's
a lie!"</p>

<p>He started in the direction of Mendele's
residence, bent upon thrashing the red-haired
talebearer to death. Soon, however, he
halted and turned homeward. The courage
failed Asriel Stroon to face the man who
had seen his daughter's fianc smoke a
cigarette on a Saturday. Then Shaya appeared
to his mind as something polluted,
sacrilegious, and although this something
had nothing in common with his beloved
prodigy, save the name, and the young man
whitened in the distance, pure and lovely as
ever, Asriel's rage surged in the direction of
his home, and he mended pace to storm the
house as soon as he could get there.</p>

<p>When he collected his wits he decided to
wait till he found out everything for himself.
For the first time, perhaps, he felt
himself a coward. He quailed before the
thought that what he had heard from the
learned peddler might prove true, and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
cringingly begged his own mind to put off
the culminating agony of believing it.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when he saw Shaya, at the
supper-table, his heart whispered to him, in
dismay: "An appikoros!" and the unuttered
word enveloped the prodigy in a forbidding,
sinister atmosphere.</p>

<p>He now hated Shaya; he felt as though
he feared him.</p>

<p>"Where have you been so late, papa?"
Flora inquired.</p>

<p>"Deep in the earth. You care much
where your papa is, do you?" he snarled.</p>

<p>"Papa!" she said deprecatingly; "are
you mad?"</p>

<p>He made no response.</p>

<p>"Have you been to the Mariv service?"
Shaya intervened. "I studied at the Souvalk
Synagogue to-day."</p>

<p>Asriel remained grimly uncommunicative.</p>

<p>The young people, reinforced by Tamara,
made several other attempts at conversation,
but the dogged taciturnity of the head of
the family cast a spell of misery over them
all, and the meal passed in unsupportable
silence.</p>

<p>"See if papa ain't getting on to what you
are doing, Shayie," Flora said, when the
two were alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
"Pshaw! is it the first time you see him
out of humor? He must have had some
trouble with a tenant or janitor."</p>

<p>"He must have," she assented gloomily.
"But what if he gets wind? I'm worrying
the life out of myself about it."</p>

<p>"So am I. I love your father just the
same as if he were my own papa. I wish
the wedding were over, don't you?" he
asked in his childish way.</p>

<h3>X</h3>

<p>On the following morning Asriel repaired
to the Souvalk Synagogue to attend the service
his usual place of worship he had not
the heart to visit), and, incidentally, to ascertain
how Shaya had spent his time there
the day before.</p>

<p>To his consternation he learned that his
"daughter's bridegroom" had not been seen
there for weeks.</p>

<p>Asriel held his counsel, and took to shadowing
the young man.</p>

<p>He now had no doubt as to the accuracy
of Reb Tzalel's story. But it gave him no
pain. It was Shaya no longer; it was not
his daughter's bridegroom; it was not the
prodigy he had imported,&mdash;it was an appikoros.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
But then Asriel's heart withered at
the notion of being the victim of systematic
deception. Shaya was an appikoros and a
secret, sneaking enemy.</p>

<p>"That youngster trick Asriel Stroon!"
He panted with hatred and thrilled with a
detective-like passion to catch Shaya in the
act of some grave violation of the Mosaic
Law.</p>

<p>He went about the various synagogues
where the young man was supposed to study
the Talmud, with a keen foretaste of his
vicious joy at finding that he had been playing
truant. Yet each time his fervent expectations
were realized he would, instead
of triumph, experience an overpowering
sense of defeat.</p>

<p>"You have been cheated out of your boots
by a stripling, Asrielke&mdash;woe to your foolish
head!" he tortured himself, reveling in an
agony of fury. "Ah, a cholera into him!
I'll show him how to fool Asriel Stroon!"</p>

<p>He discovered that Shaya's frequent companion
was his former teacher of English,
whom he often visited in his attic room on
Clinton Street, and he impatiently awaited
the next Saturday to raid the atheistic resort
and to overtake Shaya smoking or writing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
on the holy day. But the climax came
a day or two sooner.</p>

<p>After tracing Shaya to the Clinton Street
house Asriel stood waiting around a corner,
at a vantage point from which he could see
the windows of the two garret rooms one
of which was the supposed scene of the
young man's ungodly pursuits. He had no
definite purpose in view, for it was not Sabbath,
and he would not spoil his game by
apprehending his man in the mere act of
reading Gentile books. Yet he was rooted
to the place, and remained aimlessly waiting,
with his eyes riveted to the windows which
they could not penetrate. Tired at last, and
overcome with a sense of having been engaged
in a fool's errand, he returned home,
and, reaching his bedroom, sank on the bed
in a prostration of hurt pride and impotent
rage.</p>

<p>On the following morning he returned to
his post. The attic windows drew him like
the evil one, as he put it to himself.</p>

<p>He had been keeping watch for some minutes
when, to his fierce joy, Shaya and his
accomplice sallied forth into the street. He
dogged their steps to Grand Street, and
thence, through the Bowery, to Lafayette
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
Place, where they disappeared behind the
massive doors of an imposing structure, apparently
neither a dwelling-place nor an
office building.</p>

<p>"Dis a choych?" Asriel asked a passer-by.</p>

<p>"A church? No, it's a library&mdash;the
Astor Library," the stranger explained.</p>

<p>"Ah, a lot of Gentile books!" he exclaimed
to himself, disappointed in one way
and triumphant in another. The unaccustomed
neighborhood and the novelty of his
impressions increased the power of the "evil
one" over him. He took up a position
whence he could observe without being observed,
and waited for the two young men to
come out. What he would gain by tracing
them back to the Jewish quarter he never
asked himself. He waited because the "evil
one" would not let him stir from the spot.</p>

<p>An hour passed. He was growing faint
with hunger; yet he never moved. "He
has not had his lunch, either," he thought.
"Still, he can stand it. It's the witchcraft
of the Gentile books&mdash;may he be burned to
death!&mdash;keeping up his strength. They'll
come out in a minute or two."</p>

<p>Many more minutes elapsed, and still Asriel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
waited. At last "Here, they are, the
convert Jews! Look at them&mdash;how jolly!
It's the Black Year shining out of their
faces&mdash;may they shine on their death-beds!
That beggar of a teacher I shall have arrested."</p>

<p>He followed them through Fourth Street
back to the Bowery and down the rumbling
thoroughfare, till&mdash;"a lamentation!"&mdash;they
entered a Christian restaurant!</p>

<p>A terrific pang smote Asriel's heart. It
was as if he saw his temple, the embodiment
of many years of labor, the object of his
fondest cares, just completed and ready to
be dedicated, suddenly enveloped in flames.
The prodigy, <em>his</em> prodigy, his Kaddish, his
glory in this and the other world, plunged
into the very thick of impurity!</p>

<p>He made to rush after them, but checked
himself to wait till the <i>treife</i><a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> food was
served them. A few minutes later he made
his entry, cool and collected as a regular
customer.</p>

<p>Each of the two young men was bent on a
veal cutlet. The collegian was dispatching
his with the nonchalant appetite and ease of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
manner of an habitu, whereas poor Shaya
looked like one affecting to relish his first
plate of raw oysters. The smells proceeding
from the kitchen made him dizzy, and the
cutlet itself, partly because he was accustomed
to meat of a better quality, but mainly
through the consciousness of eating treife,
inclined him to nausea.</p>

<p>Asriel took a vacant chair at the same
table.</p>

<p>"Bless the sitter,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Shaya!" he said.</p>

<p>The two young men were petrified.</p>

<p>"How is the pork&mdash;does it taste well?"
Asriel pursued.</p>

<p>"It is not pork. It is veal cutlet," the
teacher found tongue to retort.</p>

<p>"I am not speaking to you, am I?" Asriel
hissed out. Murder was swelling in his
heart. But at this point the waiter came
up to his side.</p>

<p>"Vot'll ye have?"</p>

<p>"Notink!" Asriel replied, suddenly rising
from his seat and rushing out, as if this were
the most terrible sort of violence he could
conceive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<h3>XI</h3>

<p>Asriel found his daughter playing.</p>

<p>"Stop that or I'll smash your Gentile
piano to pieces!" he commanded her, feeling
as though the instrument had all along
been in the conspiracy and were now bidding
him defiance.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter?" she questioned,
getting up from her stool in stupefaction.</p>

<p>"Matter? Bluff a dead rooster, not me&mdash;my
head is still on my shoulders. Here
it is, you see?" he added, taking himself
by the head. "It's all up, Flora."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she made out to
inquire.</p>

<p>"I mean that if Shayke<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> ever enters this
house I'll murder both of you. You thought
your papa was a fool, didn't you? Well,
you are a poor hand at figuring, Flora. I
knew everything, but I wanted some particulars.
I have got them all now here, in
my pocket, and a minute ago I took the
pleasure of bidding him 'bless the sitter' in
a Gentile restaurant&mdash;may he be choked
with his treife gorge!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
"You've got no business to curse him
like that!" she flamed out, coloring violently.</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> have no business? And who is to
stop me, pray?"</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> am. It ain't my fault. You know I
did not care at first."</p>

<p>The implication that he had only himself
to blame threw him into a new frenzy. But
he restrained himself, and said with ghastly
deliberation:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Flora, you are not going to marry him."</p>

<p>"I <em>am</em>. I can't live without him," she
declared with quiet emphasis.</p>

<p>Asriel left her room.</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>"It's all gone, Tamara! My candle is
blown out," he said, making his way from
the dining-room to the kitchen. "There is
no Shaya any longer."</p>

<p>"A weeping, a darkness to me! Has an
accident&mdash;mercy and peace!&mdash;befallen the
child?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he is 'dead and buried, and gone
from the market-place.' Worse than that:
a convert Jew is worse than a dead one.
It's all gone, Tamara!" he repeated gravely.
"I have just seen him eating treife in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
a Gentile restaurant. America has robbed
me of my glory."</p>

<p>"Woe is me!" the housekeeper gasped,
clutching at her wig. "Treife! Does he not
get enough to eat here?" She then burst
out, "Don't I serve him the best food there
is in the world? Any king would be glad
to get such dinners."</p>

<p>"Well, it seems treife tastes better,"
Asriel rejoined bitterly.</p>

<p>"A calamity upon my sinful head! We
must have evil-eyed the child; we have devoured
him with our admiring looks."</p>

<p>While Asriel was answering her volley of
questions, Flora stealthily left the house.</p>

<p>When Stroon missed her he hurried off
to Clinton Street. There he learned of the
landlady that her lodger had left a short
while before, in the company of his friend
and a young lady whom the two young men
had found waiting in her parlor. In his
despair Asriel betook himself to the Astor
Library, to some of Flora's friends, and even
to the Bowery restaurant.</p>

<p>When he reached home, exhausted with
fatigue and rage, he found his daughter in
her room.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" he demanded,
sternly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
"I'll tell you where, but don't aggravate
yourself, papaly," she replied in beseeching,
tearful accents.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?"</p>

<p>"I am going to tell you, but don't blame
Shaya. He is awful fond of you. It's all
my fault. He didn't want to go, but I
couldn't help it, papaly. We've been to
the city court and got married by a judge.
Shaya didn't want to."</p>

<p>"You married!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but don't be angry, papaly darlin'.
We'll do everything to please you. If you
don't want him to be a doctor, he won't."</p>

<p>"A doctor!" he resumed, still speaking
like one in a daze. "Is that what you have
been up to? I see&mdash;you have got the best
of me, after all. You married, Flora?" he
repeated, unable to apply the meaning of
the word to his daughter. "In court&mdash;without
Canopy and Dedication&mdash;like Gentiles?
What have you done, Flora?" He
sank into a chair, gnashing his teeth and
tearing at his sidelocks.</p>

<p>"Papaly, papaly, don't!" she sobbed,
hugging and kissing him. "You know I
ain't to blame for it all."</p>

<p>It dawned upon him that no serious wrong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
had been committed, after all, and that it
could all be mended by a Jewish marriage
ceremony; and so great was his relief at
the thought that it took away all his anger,
and he even felt as if he were grateful to
his daughter for not being guilty of a graver
transgression than she was.</p>

<p>"I know you are not to blame," he said,
tragic in his calmness. "America has done
it all. But what is the use talking! It's
gone, and I am not going to take another
sin upon my soul. I won't let you be his
wife without Canopy and Dedication. Let
the Jewish wedding come off at once&mdash;this
week&mdash;to-morrow. You have got the best
of me and I don't kick, do I? It seems
God does not want Asrielke the boor to
have some joy in his old age, nor a Kaddish
for his soul, when the worms will be feasting
upon his silly bones"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, don't say that, papa. It'll break
my heart if you do. You know Shaya is as
good as a son to you."</p>

<p>"An appikoros my son? An appikoros
my Kaddish? No," he rejoined, shaking his
head pensively.</p>

<p>As he said it he felt as if Flora, too, were
a stranger to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
He descended to the basement in a state
of mortal indifference.</p>

<p>"I have lost everything, Tamara," he
said. "I have no daughter, either. I am
all alone in the world&mdash;alone as a stone."</p>

<p>He had no sooner closed the kitchen door
behind him, than Flora was out and away
to Clinton Street to surprise her bridegroom
with the glad news of her father's surrender.</p>

<p>The housekeeper was in the kitchen, sewing
upon some silk vestments for the scrolls
of her synagogue. Asriel stood by her side,
leaning against the cupboard door, in front
of the Palestine box. Speaking in a bleak,
resigned undertone, he told her of Flora's
escapade and of his determination to make
the best of it by precipitating the Jewish
ceremony. A gorgeous celebration was now,
of course, out of the question. The proposed
fte which was to have been the talk
of the synagogues and which had been the
centre of his sweetest dreams had suddenly
turned in his imagination to something like a
funeral feast. Tamara bade him be of good
cheer, and cited Rabbi Nochum And-This-Too,
who would hail the severest blows of
fate with the words: "And this, too, is for
the best." But Asriel would not be comforted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
"Yes, Tamara, it is gone, all gone," he
murmured forlornly. "It was all a dream,&mdash;a
last year's lemon pie. It has flown
away and you can't catch it. Gone, and
that's all. You know how I feel? As if
some fellow had played a joke on me."</p>

<p>The pious woman was moved.</p>

<p>"But it is a sin to take things so close to
heart," she said impetuously. "You must
take care of your health. Bear up under
your affliction like a righteous Jew, Reb
Asriel. Trust to the Uppermost, and you
will live to rejoice in your child and in her
children, if God be pleased."</p>

<p>Asriel heaved a sigh and fell silent. He
stood with his eyes upon the pilgrim box,
listening to the whisper of her needle.</p>

<p>"You know what; let us go to the Land
of Israel," he presently said, as though continuing
an interrupted sentence. "They
have got the best of me. I cannot change
the world. Let them live as they please
and be responsible to the Uppermost for
themselves. I don't care the kernel of a
hollow nut. I shall give Flora half my
property and the rest I'll sell. You are a
righteous woman, Tamara. Why not marry
and end our days serving God in the Holy
Land together?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
Tamara plied her needle with redoubled
zeal. He could see only her glossy black
wig and the flaming dusk of her cheek.</p>

<p>"We'll have a comfortable living and
plenty of money for deeds of charity," he
pursued. "I know I am only a boor. Do
I say I am not? But is a boor no human
being at all? Can't I die a righteous Jew?"
he pleaded piteously.</p>

<p>The glossy wig bent lower and the silk
rustled busily.</p>

<p>"You know that I have on my tongue
what I have on my lung, Tamara. I mean
what I say, and we want no matchmakers.
America is now treife to me. I can't show
my head. The world is dark and empty to
me. All is gone, gone, gone. I am a little
baby, Tamara. Come, take pity. I shall
see Flora married according to the laws of
Moses and Israel, and then let us put up a
canopy and set out on our journey. I want
to be born again. Well?"</p>

<p>There was no response.</p>

<p>"Well, Tamara?"</p>

<p>"Since it is the will of God," she returned
resignedly, without raising her head from
the vestments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span></p>

<h3>XII</h3>

<p>Flora was all of a flutter with impatience
to share her joy with Shaya, and yearning
for his presence. She had not seen him
since he had become her legal husband, and
the two or three hours seemed a week.</p>

<p>When the German landlady of the little
Clinton Street house told her that neither
her lodger nor his friend were in the attic
room the young woman's heart sank within
her. Her message seemed to be bubbling
over and her over-wrought mind too weak
to bear it another minute. She mentally
berated her absent bridegroom, and not
knowing whither to bend her steps in quest
of him she repaired to some girl friends to
while away the time and to deliver herself
of part of her burden to them.</p>

<p>"When he comes tell him he da's not
leave for one second till I come back. Tell
him I've got some grand news for him,"
she instructed the landlady, struggling hard
against a wild temptation to unbosom herself
to the stranger.</p>

<p>It was about eight o'clock when she returned.
Shaya met her in the hallway.</p>

<p>"Well?" he inquired anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
"Well?" she mocked him. "You are a
daisy! Why didn't you wait? Couldn't
you guess I'd come?"</p>

<p>"How should I? But tell me what your
father says. Why should you torment me?"</p>

<p>"He says he don't want you," she replied.
But her look told even a more encouraging
tale than the one she had to deliver, and
they flew into mutual embrace in an outburst
of happiness which seemed to both of
them unlike any they had ever experienced
before.</p>

<p>"A life into your little eyes! A health
into your little hands and feet!" he muttered,
stroking her arm sheepishly. "You
shall see how fine it will all come out. You
don't know me yet. I tell you you don't
begin to know me," he kept repeating with
some braggadocio and without distinctly
knowing what he meant.</p>

<p>They were to return home at once and to
try to pacify Asriel as best they could.
When Flora pressed him to take his hat
and overcoat, however, he looked reluctant
and then said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Floraly, you know what; come upstairs
for just one minute. We are reading the
nicest book you ever saw, and there is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
lot of such nice gentlemen there!&mdash;several
genuine Americans&mdash;Christians. Do come,
Floraly." He drew her up the two flights
of stairs almost by force. "Don't be afraid:
the landlady knows all about it," he whispered.
"You'll see what nice people. I
tell you they are so educated, and they love
Jews so much! A Jew is the same as a
Gentile to them&mdash;even better."</p>

<p>Flora felt a lump growing in her heart.
The notion of Shaya being at this minute
interested in anything outside of herself and
their mutual happiness literally dazed her,
and before she had time to recover from her
shock she was in the over-crowded attic.</p>

<p>There were some ten or twelve men in the
room, some seated&mdash;two on chairs, two on
the host's trunk, and three on his bed&mdash;the
others standing by the window or propping
the sloping wall with their heads. They
were clustered about a round table, littered
with books, papers, and cigarette stumps.
A tin can was hissing on the flat top of a
little parlor stove, and some of the company
were sipping Russian tea from tumblers,
each with a slice of lemon floating in it.
The group was made up of a middle-aged
man with a handsome and intensely intellectual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
Scotch face, who was a laborer by
day and a philosopher by night; a Swedish
tailor with the face of a Catholic priest; a
Zurich Ph. D. in blue eyeglasses; a young
Hindoo who eked out a wretched existence
by selling first-rate articles to second-rate
weeklies, and several Russian Jews, all of
them insatiable debaters and most of them
with university or gymnasium diplomas.
The group met every Thursday to read
and discuss Harriet Martineau's "Auguste
Comte," under the guidance of the Scotchman,
who was a leading spirit in positivist
circles.</p>

<p>The philosopher surrendered his chair to
the lady, in a flurry of chivalry, but a seat
was made for him on the trunk, and he
forthwith resumed his reading with well-bred
impetuosity, the kerosene lamp in the
centre of the table casting a halo upon his
frank, pleasant face.</p>

<p>His auditors were now listening with conscious
attention, some of the younger men
affecting an absorbed mien or interrupting
the reader with unnecessary questions.
Shaya's eyes were traveling between Flora
and the Scotchman's audience. "Did you
ever see such a beautiful and stylish young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
lady?" he seemed to be saying. "She is
my bride&mdash;mine and nobody else's in the
world," and, "Look at these great men,
Flora&mdash;I am their chum." Presently,
however, he became engrossed in the reading;
and only half-conscious of Flora's presence,
he sat leaning forward, his mouth
wide open, his face rapt, and his fingers
quietly reproducing the mental gymnastics
of Comte's system in the air.</p>

<p>The young woman gazed about her in
perplexity. The Scotchman and his reading
inspired her with respect, but the rest of
the company and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout ensemble</i> of the
scene impressed her as the haunt of queer
individuals, meeting for some sinister purpose.
It was anything but the world of intellectual
and physical elegance into which
she had dreamed to be introduced by marriage
to a doctor. Any society of "custom
peddlers" was better dressed than these
men, who appeared to her more like some
of the grotesque and uncouth characters in
Dickens's novels than an assemblage of educated
people. For a moment even Shaya
seemed a stranger and an enemy. Overcome
by the stuffy, overheated atmosphere
of the misshapen apartment, she had a sense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
of having been kidnaped into the den of
some terrible creatures, and felt like crying
for help. Next she was wondering what her
Shaya could have in common with these
shabby beings and what it all had to do
with becoming a doctor and riding in a
buggy.</p>

<p>"Shaya!" she whispered, tugging him
by the coat-sleeve.</p>

<p>"Just one moment, Floraly," he begged
her. "Ah, it's so deep!"</p>

<p>A discussion engaged itself. The Russians
fell to greedily. One of them, in
particular, a young man with a dignified
bass, was hateful to Flora. She could not
have told you why, but his voice, coupled
with the red embroidery of his Little-Russian
shirt-front, cut her to the quick.</p>

<p>The room was full of smoke and broken
English.</p>

<p>Shaya was brimful of arguments and
questions which he had not the courage to
advance; and so he sat, now making a vehement
gesture of despair at somebody
else's absurdities, now nodding violent approval,
and altogether fidgeting about in a
St. Vitus's dance of impotent pugnacity.</p>

<p>"Shaya, it is getting late, and papa"&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
"One second, do please, Floraly, may
you live long," he implored her, with some
irritation; and taking the book from the
Scotchman's hand, he fell to turning over
its leaves in a feverish search of what struck
him as a misinterpreted passage.</p>

<p>Flora was going to protest and to threaten
to leave without him, but she could neither
speak nor stir from her seat. A nightmare
of desolation and jealousy choked her&mdash;jealousy
of the Scotchman's book, of the
Little-Russian shirt, of the empty tea-glasses
with the slices of lemon on their
bottoms, of the whole excited crowd, and
of Shaya's entire future, from which she
seemed excluded.</p>

<h2>A PROVIDENTIAL MATCH</h2>

<p>He is still known among his townspeople
as Rouvke Arbel. Rouvke they call him,
because this name, in its more respectful
form of Rouven, was bestowed upon him on
the eighth day of his life, at the ceremony
which initiated him into Israel. As to the
nickname of Arbel, which is Yiddish for
"sleeve," he is indebted for it to the apparently
never-to-be-forgotten fact that before
he came to America, and when he still
drove horses and did all sorts of work for
Peretz the distiller, he was in the habit of
assigning to the sleeves of his sheepskin
coat such duties as generally devolve upon a
pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>That was only about four years ago; and
yet Rouvke is now quite a different young
man in quite a different coat and with a
handkerchief in its side-pocket. The face is
precisely the same: the same everlasting
frown, the same pockmarks, hollow yet ruddy
cheeks, snub nose, and little gray eyes, at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
once timid and sly. But for all that, such
is the dissimilarity between the Rouvke of
four years ago and the Rouvke of to-day that
recently, when his mother, who still peddles
boiled potatoes in Kropovetz, Government
of Kovno, had been surprised by a photograph
of her son, her first impulse was to
spit at the portrait and to repudiate it as the
ungodly likeness of some unknown gentile.
But then this photograph, which, by the way,
Rouvke had taken by mere chance and for
the sole reason that it was no use trying to
get any cash from the Bowery photographer,
to whom he had sold, on the installment plan,
"a pair of pants made to order"&mdash;this photograph
fully establishes its original's claim
of not being a "greener" in the New World.
For this is what the portrait reveals.
Rouvke's hair is now entirely free from the
pair of sidelocks, or <i>peieths</i>, which dangled
over his ears when he first set foot on American
soil; it is parted in the middle and
combed on either side in the shape of a curled
ostrich-feather. He wears a collar; and this
collar is so high and so much below the size
of his neck that it gives you the uncomfortable
idea of its owner having swallowed the
handle of the whip with which he used to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
rule over Peretz the distiller's mare. The
flannel muffler, which seemed never to part
company with him while he lived in Kropovetz,
has been supplanted by a gay necktie,
and the sheepskin by a diagonal "cut-away."</p>

<p>Now, if you were conversant with the business
of "custom-peddling," you might perhaps
conjecture, upon inspecting Rouvke's
photograph, that his cut-away, which seems
to be at least one size too large for him, had
formerly encased the portly figure of a bartender.
And so it had, although for no
length of time; for finding the bartender
as backward in his payments as the photographer
had been, Rouvke soon contrived
to prevail upon his delinquent customer to
exchange the cut-away for a "mishfeet corkshcrew
Printz Albert," which would "feet
him like a glove," and carrying off the diagonal
in advance he let the bartender wait
for the glove-like garment until doomsday.</p>

<p>But "bishness is bishness," as Rouvke
would put it. Otherwise he is quite a fine
fellow. His bills he pays promptly. On
the Eve of the Day of Atonement he subscribes
a dollar or two to the funds of the
synagogue "Sons of Kropovetz," and has
been known to start a newly arrived townsman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
in business by standing his security in
a perforated chair-seat store to the amount
of two dollars and a half. Nevertheless,
since he visits the Bowery Savings Bank on
Saturdays with the same punctuality with
which he puts on his phylacteries and prays
in his room every morning on week-days, and
since his townsfolk, who, unlike him, are
blessed with families, cannot afford such
excursions to the Bowery institution, these
latter Kropovetz Americans begrudge him
his bank account, as well as his credit in the
peddler-supply stores, and out of sheer envy
like to refer to him, not as Robert Friedman,
as his business-card reads, but as "Rouvke
Arbel&mdash;what do you think of that slouch!"</p>

<p>Let us hope, however, that these invidious
references never reach Rouvke's ears; for
his susceptibilities in this direction are, it
must be owned, rather keen. Indeed, if there
be a weakness of which he is guilty, it is a
rather intense love of approbation and a
slight proneness to parade himself. I do not
know what he would not give to have people
say: "Robert is a smart fellow! Robert is
no greenhorn! Robert is the best soul in
the world!" It was this foible which, in
translating his first name into English, caused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
him to prefer Robert to Reuben, on the
ground that the former appellation seemed
to have less of Kropovetz and more of a
"tzibilized" sound to it.</p>

<p>The feminine element was until recently
absent from Rouvke's life. True, while at
home, in the domestic employ of Peretz, the
distiller, he would bestow an occasional pinch
on Leike the servant maid's cheek. But
that was by no means a pinch of gallantry;
it was never one of those pinches which a
Kropovetz lad will accompany with a look
of ostensible mock admiration in his half-shut
eyes, and with the exclamation: "Capital
stuff, that! as sure as I am a Jew!"
No! Leike the lame devil, Leike the scold,
Rouvke hated from the deepest recesses of
his driver's soul; and when he pinched her,
as he often did in the kitchen, he did it, not
from love, but simply that she might smart
and "jump to heaven, the scarecrow." And
Leike would so amply repay him with the
ladle, that there would ensue a series of the
most complex and the most ingenious oaths,
attended by hair-tearing and by squeaking,
till the mistress would come rushing in and
terminate the war by boxing the ears of both
belligerent parties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
To Hanele, his master's only daughter,
Rouvke used to serve tea with more alacrity
than to the rest of the family; and when
Feive, the matchmaker, made his first appearance
and the first suitor was introduced,
Rouvke's appetite for sour cream and rye
bread somehow disappeared for a few days,
while Rouvke himself moved about as if out
of gear, and on one occasion caught a slap
in the face, because, upon being ordered to
fetch a pail of water, he stood staring as if
he did not understand Yiddish. But this
seemed of no consequence, and Rouvke himself
could not, for the life of him, explain
this sudden disappearance both of his appetite
and presence of mind. Indeed, how
could he have dared to connect Hanele with
it? What could there have been in common
between the relish for sour cream of a mere
driver, and the pet daughter of Reb<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Peretz,
the distiller, the son of Rabbi Berele,
and the first citizen of Kropovetz?</p>

<p>The negotiations of which Hanele was the
object were soon broken off, and Rouvke's
truant appetite again fell into the line of
drivers' appetites; with this difference, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
that, when Hanele asked for a glass of
tea, he would now run to serve her with still
more eagerness than before.</p>

<p>Suitor after suitor called and was dismissed,
until a year rolled by, when Rouvke's
name appeared in the military service-roll,
and he packed off for America.</p>

<p>In America he passed his first four years
in the school of peddling, among the most
diligent and most successful of its students,
and so had no mind for anything else in the
world. Only during the first few months
his heart would almost unremittingly be
pining and yearning after Kropovetz&mdash;after
his mother, his master's family, his master's
apple-tree, under which he had loved to
steal a nap on summer days; the raised
lawn in front of the house, where he would
sit down of a Friday evening and show off
his enormous top-boots, just after he had
given them a fresh coat of tar, "in honor of
the Sabbath;" the well by the synagogue,
where on Saturdays, during the intermission
in the morning prayer, he used to indulge
in a lark with his chums, while the elder
members of the congregation were attending
the reading of the scrolls. But of all the
memories which at this early period of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
life in New York troubled his busy mind
and gnawed at his enterprising heart that of
Hanele was the most excruciating and the
most persistent. In due course, however,
the waves of time drowned in his mind and
in his heart Hanele as well as the apple-tree,
the lawn in front of the house, and the
well by the synagogue. Only at rare intervals,
when plying a new arrival from Kropovetz
with questions as to the place where
his cradle had been rocked, Rouvke would,
after a cursory inquiry concerning the health
of his mother and of the Peretz family in
general, exact the most minute information
about Hanele; and then he would for some
time feel as if his heart was "stretching,"
as he himself would mentally define the
effect of his stirred-up recollections.</p>

<p>For the rest, Rouvke followed the regular
peddler course with undisturbed assiduity.
From a handkerchief peddler he was promoted
to "basket-peddling"&mdash;that is to
say, his stock became plentiful enough and
heterogeneous enough to call for a portable
store in the shape of a basket. After a
while he joined the class where the peddling
is done on the "stairses" of tenement-houses.
The curriculum of this class includes the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
occasional experience of being sent head
foremost down all the "stairses," of then
picking one's self up and imperturbably
knocking at some door on the ground-floor,
only to come face to face with the janitor
and thus get into fresh trouble, and so on.
Finally, Rouvke reached the senior grade of
the institution, and graduated with the degree
of custom peddler, and with the following
business card for his diploma: "Robert
Friedman, Dealer in Furniture, Carpets,
Jewelry, Clothing, Ladies' Dress Goods, etc.
Weekly Payments Taken."</p>

<p>As has been said, Rouvke was a stranger
to the feminine world. He met a good
many members of the gentle sex, but that
was exclusively in a business way. The
other peddlers he would often encounter on
the street in company with nicely dressed
"yoong laddas," with whom they loudly
spoke in English. He also knew that these
fellows attended dancing academies, balls,
and picnics; but to him himself these entertainments
were a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra incognita</i>. And
sometimes when Rouvke entered the house
of a fellow countryman on business (Rouvke
never visited his fellow countrymen except
on business), and there happening to be an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
English-speaking young woman, the host
said: "Miss Goldberg&mdash;Mr. Friedman;
Mr. Friedman&mdash;Miss Goldberg," Mr.
Friedman would blush crimson at the transaction,
while the sentence, "I'm pleashed
to meech you," which he well knew was then
in order, stuck in his throat and would not
budge. This, however, was no common
occurrence, for Rouvke took care to avoid
such predicaments. At all events, he never
allowed these things to bother his head.</p>

<p>After a while, however, by the time the
peddlers and his townsfolk estimated his
capital in cash at five thousand dollars, and
when he actually had over three thousand
dollars in bank deposits and twenty-five
summers behind his back, his heart somehow
resumed its old stretching process. He was
at a loss to account for it; but he became
aware that each time he passed by a pretty
young woman this stretching sensation forced
him to outrun her, and, making a show of
stopping to look at a window display, to
allow his eyes to stray off under the brim of
the fair one's hat.</p>

<p>He gradually became a new sort of Rouvke.
Formerly, when he was subjected to the tortures
of an introduction to a "yoong ladda,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
the ordeal would result in a mere blush,
accompanied by one or two minutes' violent
throbbing. Whereas now, every time a
similar accident befell him, he would, after
the calamity was over, hasten to find himself
in front of a looking-glass, and fall to inspecting
his glaring necktie and more particularly
the pockmarks on his nose. In times
past he was hardly ever conscious of these
traces of smallpox on his face; now they
dwelt in his mind with such pertinacity that
one night he dreamed of seeing a watermelon,
which was somehow at the same time
a dog with a huge nose all covered with
pocks. And when he awoke in the morning
he felt so sick at heart that he could not
relish his breakfast, and was so dazed all
that day that he had a carpet sent to an
Irishwoman who had ordered some satin for
a dress.</p>

<p>Rouvke enrolled in a public evening
school for immigrants, and when he had
achieved the wisdom of piecing together the
letters in "cat," "rat," "mat," of the First
Reader, he one afternoon bought a newspaper,
and applied himself to looking for an
advertisement of some physician who would
undertake to remove the footprints of smallpox.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
He had an idea that the papers contained
kindred advertisements. The undertaking
proved a failure, however, for Rouvke
could detect in the paper neither "cat" nor
"rat," while the other words only swam before
his eyes. And his heart was "stretching"
and "stretching."</p>

<p>It would be unfair to Rouvke, however,
to ascribe his attending evening school to
the sole purpose of being able to make out
a medical advertisement. His chief motive
therefor was twofold: In the first place, he
would often say to himself: "Robert, bear
in mind that you are Rouvke no longer; the
chances are that in a year or two you may
open a peddler's supply-store of your own:
now, you know that the owner of a store
who cannot read and write is in danger of
being robbed by his bookkeeper." In the
second place, his "stretching" heart seemed
to whisper: "Robert, remember those ladies
have nothing but sneers for a gentleman who
does not know how to read a newspaper."</p>

<p>Moreover, those of his fellow peddlers
who had studied the Talmud in Russia, and
having, therefore, some mental training,
found no trouble in picking up some crumbs
of broken English in its written form, would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
often rally him on the "iron head" he must
possess to retain the ponderous load of the
addresses and accounts of his numerous customers
without committing them to writing.
These pleasantries pierced Rouvke to the
heart; but the pain they gave him was not
half so cruel as his moral pangs at the jokes
which were showered at him on the subject
of his shyness in the presence of ladies.
Often he would be entrapped into the company
of a "nearly American-born" daughter
of Israel; but a still more frequent prank
at his expense was for a facetious fellow to
drag him out to the middle of the floor in a
peddler-supply store, and to force him into
a waltz, or to jestingly measure his legs, by
way of ascertaining their potential adroitness
in a dancing-hall. "Eh, Robert!" they
would torment him, "buy a teecket for a
ball, veel you? A ball fi'sht clesh, I tell
you. Come, ven the laddas veel shee you,
dey veel get shtuck&mdash;in de co'ners." Robert
would struggle, scream, swear, and, after
all, steal up to the front of the looking-glass.
And his heart would be "stretching" and
"stretching."</p>

<p>Whenever he heard of a new marriage,
he would apply for details as to the bride
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
and the bridegroom&mdash;how much he earned
a week, how they came to be engaged, what
space of time interposed between the engagement
and the wedding. One Saturday morning,
while mounting the stairs which led to
his miniature hall bedroom, he saw through
an open door a young woman buttoning the
shirt-collar for her husband; whereupon his
heart swelled with a feeling of mixed envy
and extreme friendliness for the young
couple. "Who is he?" he remarked to
himself, on reaching his room, which now
seemed to him desolate and lonely. "Only
a tailor, a penniless workman. When I am
married I shall not live in a tenement
house." And at this his fancy unfolded a
picture: A parlor with bronze clock on the
mantelpiece; a mirror between two lace window-curtains;
a dark-eyed little woman in
a chocolate-colored wrapper sweeping a carpet
of flaming red and yellow; and, behold!
he, Robert, comes in from business, and the
young woman addresses him in a piping little
voice: "Hello, Rob! Will you have
dinner?" just as he had the day before seen
in the house of a newly married custom-peddler.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, in those days of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
"heart-stretching," that one Saturday morning
Robert met at the "Sons of Kropovetz"
Synagogue a new arrival from his native
place in the person of Feive the <i>melamed</i>.
As the Hebrew term implies, this tall and
bony old gentleman, with the face of a
martyr, had at home conducted one of the
schools in which a Jewish boy passes the
day, learning the Word of God. As is not
unusual with melameds, Feive's profession
yielded him an income which made it necessary
for him to devote his spare hours to
the business of <i>shadchen</i>, or <i>shidech</i> agent&mdash;that
is, of matchmaker in the matrimonial
sense of the word. In course of time
the shadchen spirit had become so deeply
imbedded in Reb Feive's soul that even on
finding himself in New York, and before
his draggling satin coat had had time to exhale
its lingering traces of steerage odors,
his long and snuff-stocked nose fell to smelling
for shidechs.</p>

<p>"Ah, Reb Feive!" Rouvke accosted his
townsman, "how do you do? Quite an unexpected
guest, as sure as I am a Jew!
When did you arrive?"</p>

<p>And after a perfunctory catechism upon
the health of his mother and Kropovetz
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
matters in general, he inquired about his
old master.</p>

<p>"Peretz?" the old man echoed Rouvke's
interrogation. "May the Uppermost have
mercy on him! You have heard that he is
now in reduced circumstances, have you
not? The distillery is closed."</p>

<p>"You don't say so!"</p>

<p>"Yes, he is in a very bad way," Reb
Feive resumed, curling one of his long yellowish-gray
sidelocks. "You know what
hard times the Jews are now having in Russia.
Things are getting from bad to worse&mdash;may
He whom I dare not mention without
washing my hands deliver us and preserve!&mdash;a
Jew can nowadays hardly engage
in any business, much less in the liquor line.
Poor Peretz, he looks so careworn!"</p>

<p>"Can it be true that the distillery has
been closed? I am <em>very</em> sorry."</p>

<p>Rouvke was moved with profound pity
for his old employer, who had been kind to
him, and to whom he had been devoted.
But this feeling of commiseration was instantly
succeeded by a vague sense of triumph.
"What have I lived to see!"
Rouvke seemed to exclaim. "I am now
richer than Reb Peretz, as sure as I am a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
Jew!" And at this he became aware of
the bank-book in his breast-pocket.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am <em>very, very</em> sorry for him!" he
added, with renewed sincerity, after a slight
pause. "Why, such an honest Jew! And
how is Hanele?"</p>

<p>"As usual," the shadchen rejoined&mdash;"still
unmarried. But it serves Peretz
right (may God not punish me for my hard
words!). When I offered her the best
matches in the world, he was hard to please.
Nothing short of a king would have suited
his ambition."</p>

<p>As the old shadchen spoke his right arm,
hand, and fingers were busily engaged punctuating
his words with a system of the most
intricate and most diversified evolutions in
the air.</p>

<p>"And how does she look?" Rouvke again
broke in. "Is she still as pretty as she used
to be?"</p>

<p>"That she is," the matchmaker returned
grimly. "But all the worse for her. Would
she were plainer looking, for then her father
would not have been so fastidious about a
young man for her, and she might be a
mother of three children by this time."</p>

<p>"Oh, she will have no trouble in making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
a match; such a beauty!" Rouvke observed.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the same day, Rouvke
lay across his bed with his legs stretched on
a chair, after his wont, and his head lost in
recollections of Hanele. She had recently
all but faded away from his memory, and
when he did have occasion to recall her, her
portrait before his mind's eye would be a
mere faint-drawn outline. But now, singularly
enough, he could somehow again vividly
see her good-natured, deep, dark eyes,
and her rosy lips perpetually exposing the
dazzling whiteness of her teeth and illuminating
her pallid face with inextinguishable
good humor; he could hear the rustle of
her fresh calico dress as she friskily ran up
to answer her father's solemnly affectionate
"Good Sabbath," on Reb Peretz's return
from synagogue, the last Saturday before
Rouvke's departure.</p>

<p>The image did not send a yearning thrill
through Rouvke, as it would have done during
his first few months in America; still,
on the other hand, it now had for his
wearied soul a quieting, benign charm, which
it had never exercised before, and the more
deeply to indulge in its soothing effect, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
shut his eyes. "Suppose I marry her."
The thought flashed through his mind, but
was instantly dismissed as an absurdity too
gross to be indulged even for a pastime.
But the thought carried him back to his old
days in Kropovetz, and he wished he could
go there in flesh for a visit. What a glorious
time it would be to let them see his
stylish American dress, his business-like
manners and general air of prosperity and
"echucation"! Ah, how they would be
stupefied to see the once Rouvke Arbel thus
elegantly attired, "like a regula' dood"!
For who in all Kropovetz wears a cut-away,
a brown derby, a necktie, and a collar like
his? And would it not be lovely to donate
a round sum to the synagogue? Oh, how
he would be sought after and paraded!</p>

<p>"Poor Reb Peretz!" he said to himself,
transferring his thoughts to the news of his
old employer's adversity. "Poor Hanele!"
Whereat the Kropovetz girl loomed up, her
head lowered and tears trickling down her
cheeks, as he had once seen her when she
sat quietly lamenting her defeated expectation
of a new dress. Rouvke conceived the
vague idea of sending Reb Peretz fifty dollars,
which would make the respectable sum
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
of one hundred rubles. But the generous
plan was presently lost in a labyrinth of figures,
accounts of his customers, and reflections
upon his prospective store, which the
notion of fifty dollars called forth in his
dollar-ridden brain.</p>

<p>He thus lay plunged in meditation until
his reverie was broken by the door flying
open.</p>

<p>"Good Sabbath! Good Sabbath!" Reb
Feive greeted his young townsman with his
martyr-like features relaxed into a significant
smile, as he squeezed himself through
the narrow space between the half-opened
door and the foot of the bedstead. "Do
not take ill my not knocking at the door
first. I am not yet used to your customs
here, greenhorn that I am."</p>

<p>"Ah, Reb Feive! Good Sabbath!"
Rouvke returned, starting up with an anxious
air and foreboding an appeal for pecuniary
assistance.</p>

<p>"Guess what brings me, Rouven."</p>

<p>"How can I tell?" the host rejoined, with
a forced simper. "And why should you
not call just for a visit in honor of the Sabbath?
You are a welcome guest. Be
seated," he added, indicating his solitary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
chair and himself keeping his seat on the
bed, which rendered the additional service
of lounge.</p>

<p>"How dare these beggarly greenhorns
beset me in this manner?" he left unsaid.
"Indeed, what business have they to come
to America at all?"</p>

<p>"Well, how are things going on in Kropovetz?"
he asked, audibly. "Business is
very dull <i>here</i>&mdash;<em>very</em> dull, indeed&mdash;may I
not be punished for talking business on
Sabbath"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, <em>do</em> leave business alone! You
had better hear my errand, Rouven," the
matchmaker said, working his fingers.
"Suppose I had a shidech for you, eh?"</p>

<p>"A shidech?" Rouvke ejaculated, much
relieved from his misgivings, only to become
all of a flutter with delicious surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, a shidech; and what sort of a one!
You never dreamed of such a shidech, I can
assure you. Never mind blushing like that.
Why, is it not high time for a young man
like you to get married?"</p>

<p>"I am not blushing at all," Rouvke protested,
coloring still more deeply, and missing
the sentence by which he had been
about to inform himself of the fair one's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
name without betraying his feverish impatience.</p>

<p>"Well," Reb Feive resumed, with a smile,
and twisting his sidelock into a corkscrew,
"it would be too cruel to try your patience.
Let us come straight to the point, then. I
mean&mdash;guess whom&mdash;well, I mean Hanele,
Peretz the distiller's Hanele! What do you
think of that?" the shadchen added in a
whisper, as he let go of his corkscrew, and
started back in well-acted ecstasy to watch
the produced effect.</p>

<p>Rouvke flushed up to the roots of his
hair, while his mouth opened in one of those
embarrassed grins which seem to be especially
adapted to the mouths of Kropovetz
horse-drivers,&mdash;one which makes the general
expression of the face such that you are
at a loss whether to take it for a smile or
for the preliminary to a cry.</p>

<p>"You must be joking, Reb Feive. Why
I a-a-a-I am not thinking of getting married
as yet; a-a-you had better tell me some
news," he faltered.</p>

<p>The fact is that the shadchen's attack had
taken him so unawares that it gave him no
time to analyze his own mind, and although
the subject thrilled his soul with delightful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
curiosity, he dreaded the risk of committing
himself. But Feive was not the man to let
himself be put off so easily in matters of a
professional nature; and so, warming up to
the beloved topic, he launched out in a flood
of garrulity, emphasizing his speech now by
striking some figure in space, now by an energetic
twirl of his yellowish gray appendages.
He enlarged with real shadchenlike
gusto on the prospective bride's virtues and
accomplishments; on the love which, according
to him, she had always professed for
Rouvke; on the frivolity of American girls;
on the honor it would confer upon his listener
to marry into the family of Reb Peretz
the distiller.</p>

<p>Rouvke followed Reb Feive with breathless
attention, but never uttered a word or
a gesture which might be interpreted into
an encouragement. This, however, mattered
but little to the old matrimonial commission
agent, for, carried away with his own eloquence,
he talked himself into the impression
that Rouvke "was willing," if I may
be permitted to borrow a phrase from a
more famous horse-driver. At any rate,
when Reb Feive suddenly bethought himself
that he came near missing the afternoon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
service at the synagogue, and abruptly got
up from his seat, Rouvke seemed anxious to
detain him; and as he returned "What is
your hurry, Reb Feive?" to his departing
visitor's "Good-pie!&mdash;is that the way you
say here on leaving?" he felt for the old
man a kind of filial tenderness.</p>

<p><i>Choson</i> is a term applied to a Jewish
young man, embracing the period from the
time he is placed on the matrimonial market
down to the termination of the nuptial
festivities. There is all the difference
in the world between a choson and a common
unmarried mortal of the male sex, who
is left to the bare designation of <i>bocher</i>, the
very sound of the hymeneal title possessing
an indefinable charm, an element of solemnity,
which seems to invest its bearer with a
glittering halo.</p>

<p>Reb Feive thus suddenly, as if by a magic
wand, converted Rouvke from a simple bocher
into a choson. And so keenly alive was
Rouvke to his unexpected transformation,
that for some time after the wizard's departure
his face was wreathed in bashful smiles,
as if his new self, by its dazzling presence,
embarrassed him. He felt the change in
himself in a general way, however, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
quite apart from the idea of Hanele. As to
Peretz's daughter, the notion of her assenting
to marry him again seemed preposterous.
Besides, admitting for argument's sake, as
the phrase goes, that she would accept him,
Rouvke reflected that he would then not be
fool enough to enter into wedlock with a
portionless girl; that if he waited a year or
two longer (although it seemed much too
long to wait), that is, until he was a prospering
storekeeper, he could get for a wife
the daughter of some Division Street merchant
with two or three thousand dollars
into the bargain.</p>

<p>So he relinquished the thought of Hanele
as a thing out of the question and proceeded
to picture himself the choson of some American
girl. But as he was making that effort,
the image of the Kropovetz maiden kept
intruding upon his imagination, interfering
with the mental process, and his heart seemed
all the while to be longing after the dismissed
subject and filled with the desire that
he might have both matches to choose from.
Finally, he yielded and resumed the discussion
of Reb Feive's project. The idea of a
Division Street business man for a father-in-law,
beside the assumption of becoming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
the son-in-law of Reb Peretz, appeared
prosaic and vulgar. Those New York merchants
had risen from the mire, like himself,
while his old master looked at the world
from the lofty height of distinguished birth,
added to Talmudical learning and exceeding
social importance. And here the ties of
traditional reverence and adoration which
bound Rouvke to his former employer made
themselves keenly felt in his heart. Ah, for
the privilege of calling Reb Peretz father-in-law!
To think of the stir the news would
make among his townsfolk, both in Kropovetz
and here in New York! Besides, the
American-born or "nearly American-born"
girls inspire him with fear. These young
ladies are brought up at picnics and balls,
while to him the very thought of inviting a
lady for a dance is embarrassing. What
are they good for, anyway? They look
more Christian than Jewish, and are only
great hands at squandering their husbands'
money on candy, dresses, and theatres. A
woman like that would domineer over him,
treat him haughtily, and generally make
life a burden to him. Hanele, dear Hanele,
on the other hand, is a true daughter of
Israel. She would make a good housekeeper;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
would occasionally also mind the
store; would accompany him to synagogue
every Saturday; and that is just what a
man like him wants in a wife. An English-speaking
Mrs. Friedman he would have to
call "darling," a word barren of any charm
or meaning for his heart, whereas Hanele
he would address in the melodious terms of
"<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kreinele meine! Gold meine!</i>"<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Ah,
the very music of these sounds would make
him cry with happiness!</p>

<p>The thought of a walk to synagogue with
Hanele, dressed in a plush cloak and an
enormous hat, by his side, and of whispering
these words of endearment in her ear was
enchanting enough; but then, enchantment-like,
the spectacle soon faded away before
the hard, retrospective fact of Rouvke, the
horse-driver, in top-boots, serving tea to
Hanele, the only daughter of Reb Peretz
the distiller. "Oh, it cannot be! Feive <em>is
a greener</em> to take such a match into his
head!" he mentally exclaimed in black despair.
And forthwith he once more sought
consolation in the prospect of a marriage
portion which a New York wife would bring
him, and fell to adding the probable amount
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
to his own future capital. Hanele will reject
him? Why, so much the better! That
makes it impossible for him to commit the
folly of sacrificing at least two thousand
dollars. And his spirits rose at the narrow
escape he was having from a ruinous temptation.
Still, lurking in a deeper corner of
his heart, there lingered something which
wounded his pride and made him feel as if
he would much rather have <em>that</em> means of
escape cut off from him and the temptation
left for himself to grapple with.</p>

<p>Feive, the melamed, had another talk with
Rouvke; but although he did not hesitate
to speak authoritatively of Reb Peretz's and
Hanele's assent, he utterly failed to elicit
from his interlocutor any positive hint. Nothing
daunted, however, the shadchen despatched
a lengthy epistle to Reb Peretz.
He went off in raptures over Rouvke's
wealth, social rank in America, and religious
habits, and gave him credit for newly acquired
education. "It is not the Rouvke
of yore," read at least one line on each of
the ten pages of the letter. The installment
peddling business was elevated to the dignity
of a combination of large concerns in furniture,
jewelry, and clothing. The owner of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
this thriving establishment was depicted as
panting with love for Hanele, and this again
was pointed out as proof that the match had
been foreordained by Providence.</p>

<p>Reb Peretz's answer had not reached its
destination when in New York there occurred
two events which came to the daring matchmaker's
assistance.</p>

<p>The daughter of a Seventh Ward landlord
had been betrothed to a successful custom
peddler, her father promising one thousand
dollars in cash, in addition to a complete
household outfit, as her marriage portion.
As the fixed wedding-day drew near, the
choson was one day shocked to receive from
his would-be father-in-law the intimation
that his girl and the household outfit were
good enough on their own merits, and that
the thousand dollars would have to be dispensed
with. The young man immediately
cut short his visits to the landlord's daughter;
but a fortnight had hardly elapsed before
he found himself behind prison bars on
an action brought in the name of his brokenhearted
sweetheart. How the matter was
compromised does not concern our story;
but the news, which for several days was
the main topic of gossip in the peddler
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
stores, reached Rouvke; and the effect it
had on him the reader may well imagine: it
riddled to pieces the only unfavorable argument
in his discussion of Feive's offer.</p>

<p>A still more powerful element in reaching
a conclusion was with Rouvke the following
incident:&mdash;</p>

<p>One day he went to see the shadchen,
who had his lodging in the house of a fellow
townsman. While he stood behind the door
adjusting his necktie, as he now invariably
did before entering a house, he overheard a
loud dialogue between the housewife and
her boarder. Catching his own name,
Rouvke paused with bated breath to listen.</p>

<p>"Pray, don't be talking nonsense, Reb
Feive," came to the ears of our eavesdropper.
"Peretz the distiller give his Hanele
in marriage to Rouvke Arbel!&mdash;That pock-pitted
bugbear and Hanele! Such a beauty,
such a pampered child! Why, anybody
would be glad to marry her, penniless as she
may be. She marry that horrid thing, slop-tub,
cholera that he is!"</p>

<p>Rouvke was cut to the quick; and shivering
before the prospect of hearing some
further uncomplimentary allusions to himself,
he was on the point of beating retreat;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
but the very thought of those epithets continuing
to be uttered at his expense, even
though beyond his hearing, was too painful
to bear; and so he put a stop to them by a
knock at the door.</p>

<p>"But are you really sure, Reb Feive, that
Reb Peretz will have me?" he queried, after
a little, all of a flutter, in a private conversation
with the shadchen, in the bedroom.</p>

<p>"Leave it to me," the marriage-broker
replied. "I have managed greater things
in my lifetime. It is as good as settled."</p>

<p>"See if I do not marry Hanele after all,
if only to spite you, grudging witch that
you are!" Rouvke, in his heart, addressed
to his townswoman, on emerging from the
pitchy darkness of the little bedroom.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Mrs. Kohen!" his tongue then
said, as his eyes looked daggers at her.</p>

<p>Reb Peretz concluded the reading of Reb
Feive's letter by good naturedly calling him
"foolish melamed." Little by little, however,
the very fact that the shadchen could
now dare conceive such a match at all began
to mortify him. It took him back to
the time when Rouvke used to sit behind
his mare, and when he, Reb Peretz, was
the most prosperous Jew for miles around,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
and it wrung his heart with pity both for
himself and for Hanele. He became aware
that it was over a year since a young man
had come to offer himself, and instead of
becoming irritated with his daughter, as
had latterly been frequently the case with
him, he was overpowered by an acute twinge
of hurt pride, as well as by compunction
for the splendid matrimonial opportunities
which he had brushed aside from her. It
occurred to Reb Peretz that Hanele was
now in her twenty-fifth year, whereupon his
fancy reproachfully pointed at his cherished
child in the form of a gray-haired old maid.
A shudder ran through his veins at the
vision, and he began to seek refuge in commercial
air castles, but the arial structures
were presently blown away, only to leave
him face to face with the wretched ramshackle
edifice of his actual affairs. His
attention reverted to the American letter,
but the collocation of Rouvke Arbel with
Hanele sickened Reb Peretz. His self-respect
suddenly rushed back upon him, and
he felt like "tearing out the beard and sidelocks"
of the impudent shadchen.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he took up the letter once
more. This time the matchmaker's eulogies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
of Rouvke's flourishing business made
a deeper impression on him, and brought
the indistinct reflection that in course of
time he might have to emigrate to America
himself with his whole family.</p>

<p>"Pooh, nonsense!" he ultimately concluded,
after a third or fourth reading of
Reb Feive's missive. "America makes a
new man of every young fellow. There had
not been a more miserable wretch than
Tevke, the watchman; and yet when he
recently came back from America for a
visit, he looked like a prince. Let her go
and be a mother of children, as behooves a
daughter of Israel. We must trust to God.
The match does look like a Providential
affair."</p>

<p>Reb Peretz was a whole day in mustering
courage for an explanation with Hanele.
But when he had at last broached the subject
to her, by means of rendering Feive's
Hebrew letter into Yiddish, his undertaking
proved easier of achievement than he had
anticipated.</p>

<p>Hanele was really a "true daughter of
Israel," and this implies that her education
was limited to the reading of a Yiddish
version of the Five Books of Moses, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
that her knowledge of the world did not
extend beyond "Kropovetz and its goats,"
as the phrase runs in her native town. She
was a taciturn, good-natured, and tractable
girl, and her greatest pleasure was to be
knitting fancy tablecloths and brooding
over day-dreams. Moreover, the repeated
appearance and disappearance of chosons, by
recurrently unsettling her hitherto calm and
easy heart, had left it in a state of perpetual
unrest. She had not fallen in love with
any of the young men who had sought her
hand and her marriage portion, for, according
to a rigid old rule of propriety to which
her father clung, she never had been allowed
the chance of interchanging a word with any
of them, even while the suit was pending.
Still, when a month passed without a shadchen
putting in an appearance, she would
often, when the latch gave a click, raise her
eyes to the door in the eager hope that it
would admit a member of that profession.
In her reveries she now frequently dwelt on
her girl friends who had married out of
Kropovetz, and then her soul would be yearning
and longing, she knew not after what.
With all the tender affection which tied her
to her family, with all her attachment to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
her native surroundings, her father's house
became dreary and lonely to her; she grew
tired of her home and homesick after the
rest of the world.</p>

<p>To be sure, the first intimation as to her
marrying Rouvke Arbel shocked her, and
on realizing the full meaning of the offer
she dropped her head on her father's shoulder
and burst into tears. But as Reb Peretz
stroked her hair, while he presented the
matter in an aspect which was even an improvement
on Feive's plea, he gradually
hypnotized her into a lighter mood, and
she recalled Rouvke's photograph, which his
mother had on several occasions flaunted before
her. The match now assumed a somewhat
romantic phase. She let her jaded
imagination waft her away to an unknown
far-off land, where she saw herself glittering
with gold and pearls and nestling up to a
masculine figure in sumptuous attire. It was
a bewitching, thrilling scene only slightly
marred by the dim outline of Rouvke in
top-boots and sheepskin rising in the background.
Ah, it was such a pity to have that
taint on the otherwise fascinating picture!
And, in order to remove the sickly blotch,
Hanele essayed to rig Rouvke out in a "cut-away,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
stand-up collar, and necktie after
the model of the photograph. But then her
effort produced a total stranger with features
she could not make out, while Rouvke
Arbel, top-boots, sheepskin and all, seemed to
have dodged the elegant attire and to remain
aloof both from the stranger and the photograph.
Well, it is not Rouvke, then, who
is proposed to her, she settled, with the
three images crowding each other in her
mind. It is an entirely new man. Besides,
who can tell what may transpire? Let her
first get to America and then&mdash;who knows,
but she may in truth marry another man, a
nice young fellow who had never been her
father's servant? And Hanele felt that such
would be the case. At all events, did not
Baske David, the flour merchant's daughter,
marry a former blacksmith in America, and
is she not happy? Ah, the letters she
writes to her!</p>

<p>"Say yes or no. Speak out, my little
dove," Reb Peretz insisted, in conclusion of
a second conversation on the same subject.
"It is not my destiny which is to be decided.
It is for you to say," he added, feeling
that Hanele had no business to render
any but an affirmative decision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
"Yes," she at last whispered, drooping
her head and bursting into a cry.</p>

<p>The shadchen gave himself no rest, and
letters sailed over the Atlantic by the dozen.
In his first reply Reb Peretz took care to
appear oscillating. His second contained a
hint as to the attachment which Hanele had
always felt for Rouvke, whom they had
treated like one of the family. There were
also letters with remote allusions to money
which Hanele would want for some dresses
and to pay her way. And thus, with every
message he penned, the conviction gained
on Reb Peretz that his daughter would be
happy in America, and that the match was
really of Providential origin.</p>

<p>These letters operated on Rouvke's heart
as an ointment does on a wound, to cite
his own illustration; and in spite of the
money hints, which constituted the fly in
this ointment, he felt happy. He thought
of Hanele; he dreamed of her; and, above
all, he thought and dreamed of the sensation
which her departure from home would
create at Kropovetz, and of his glory on her
arrival in New York. "Good luck to you,
Robert!" the peddlers repeatedly congratulated
him. "Have you ever dreamed of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
becoming the son-in-law of Peretz the distiller?
There should be no end to the
treats which you ought to stand now." And
Robert stood treat and was wreathed in
chosonlike smiles.</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>It was a busy day at Castle Garden.
Several transatlantic steamers had arrived,
and the railed inclosure within the vast shed
was alive with a motley crowd of freshly
landed steerage passengers. Outside, there
was a cluster of empty merchandise trucks
waiting for their human loads, while at a
haughty distance from these stood a pair
of highly polished carriages&mdash;quite a rare
sight in front of the immigrant landing station.
It was Rouvke who had engaged
these superior vehicles. He had come in
them with Reb Feive, and with two or three
others of his fellow countrymen and brothers
in business, to meet Hanele. He was dressed
in his Saturday clothes and in a brand-new
brown derby hat, and even wore a huge red
rose which one of the party, a gallant custom
peddler, had stuck into the lapel of his
"cut-away" before starting.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of the barn-like garden
was laden with nauseating odors of steerage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
and of carbolic acid, and reeking with human
wretchedness. Leaning against the
railing or sitting on their baggage, there
were bevies of unkempt men and women in
shabby dress of every cut and color, holding
on to ragged, bulging parcels, baskets, or
sacks, and staring at space with a look of
forlorn, stupefied, and cowed resignation.
The cry of children in their mothers' arms,
blending in jarring discord with the gruff
yells of the uniformed officers, jostling their
way through the crowd, and with the general
hum and buzz inside and outside the
inclosure, made the scene as painful to the
ear as it was to the eye and nostrils, and
completed the impression of misery and desolation.</p>

<p>Rouvke and his companions, among a
swarm of other residents of the East Side,
who, like themselves, had come to meet
newly landed friends, stood gazing through
the railing. Rouvke was nervously biting
his finger-nails, and now and then brushing
his new derby with his coat-sleeve or adjusting
his necktie. Reb Feive was winding
his sidelock about his finger, while the
young peddlers were vying with each other
in pleasantries appropriate to the situation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
Our choson was lost in a tumult of emotions.
He made repeated attempts at collecting his
wits and devising a befitting form of welcome;
he tried to figure to himself Hanele's
present appearance and to forecast her conduct
on first catching sight of him; he also
essayed to analyze the whole situation and to
think out a plan for the immediate future.
But all his efforts fell flat. His thoughts
were fragmentary, and no sooner had he
laid hold of an idea or an image than it
would flee from his mind again and his attention
would, for spite, as it were, occupy
itself with the merest trifle, such as the size
of the whiskers of one of the officers or the
sea-biscuit at which an immigrant urchin
was nibbling.</p>

<p>At last Rouvke's heart gave a leap. His
eyes had fallen on Hanele. She was still
more beautiful and charming than before.
Instead of the spare and childish-looking
girl whom he had left at Kropovetz, there
stood before him a stately, well-formed
young woman of twenty-five.</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;Ha&mdash;Hanele!" he gasped out,
all but melting away with emotion, and suddenly
feeling, not like Robert Friedman,
but like Rouvke Arbel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
Hanele turned her head toward him, but
she did not see him. So at least it seemed,
for instead of pushing her way to the part
of the railing where he stood, she started
back and obliterated herself in the crowd.</p>

<p>Presently her name was called, together
with other names, and she emerged from a
stream of fellow immigrants. More dead
than alive, Rouvke ran forward to meet
her; but he had advanced two steps when
his legs refused to proceed, and his face became
blank with amazement. For, behold,
snugly supporting Hanele's arm, there was
a young man in spectacles and in a seedy
gray uniform overcoat of a Russian collegian,
with its brass buttons superseded by
new ones of black celluloid.</p>

<p>The pair marched up to Rouvke, she with
her eyes fixed at the floor, as she clung to
her companion, and the collegian with his
head raised in timid defiance.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Rouven?" she began.
"This is <i>Gospodin</i><a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Levinsky&mdash;my choson.
Do not take it ill, Rouven. I am not
to blame, as true as I am a child of Israel.
You see, it is my Providential match, and I
could not help it," she rattled off in a trembling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
voice and like an embarrassed schoolboy
reciting a lesson which he has gotten
well by heart.</p>

<p>"I'll pay you every copeck, you can rest
assured," the collegian interposed, turning
as white as a sheet. "I have a rich brother
in Buffalo."</p>

<p>Hanele had met the young man in the
steerage of the Dutch vessel which brought
them across the ocean; and they passed
a fortnight there, walking or sitting together
on deck, and sharing the weird overawing
whispers of the waves, the stern
thumping of the engine, and the soothing
smiles of the moon&mdash;that skillfulest of
shadchens in general, and on ship's deck in
particular. The long and short of it is that
the matchmaking luminary had cut Reb
Feive out of his job.</p>

<p>Hanele's explanation at first stunned
Rouvke, and he stood for some time eyeing
her with a grin of stupid distraction. But
presently, upon recovering his senses, he
turned as red as fire, and making a face
like that of a child when suddenly robbed of
its toy, he wailed out in a husky voice:</p>

<p>"I want my hundred and fifty dollars
back!" And then in English:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
"I call a politzman. I vant my hoondered
an' fifty dollar!"</p>

<p>"<em>Ai, ai</em>&mdash;murderess! murderess!" Reb
Feive burst out at Hanele. "I am going
to get your father to come over here, <em>ai, ai</em>!"
he lamented, all but bursting into tears
with rage. And presently, in caressing
tones:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Hanele! I know you are
a good and God-fearing Jewish girl. Fie!
drop that abominable beggar. Leave that
gentile-like shaven mug, I tell you. Rouven
is your Providential match. Look at him,
the prince that he is! You will live like a
queen with him, you will roll in gold and
jewels, Hanele!"</p>

<p>But Hanele only clung to the collegian's
arm the faster, and the two were about to
leave the Garden, when Rouvke grasped his
successful rival by the lapels of his overcoat,
crying as he did so: "Politzman! Politzman!"</p>

<p>The young couple looked a picture of
helplessness. But at this juncture a burly
shaven-faced "runner" of an immigrant
hotel, who had been watching the scene,
sprang to their rescue. Brushing Rouvke
aside with a thrust of his mighty arm, accompanied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
by a rasping "Git out, or I'll
punch your pockmarked nose, ye monkey!"
he marched Hanele and her choson away,
leaving Rouvke staring as if he were at a
loss to realize the situation, while Reb Feive,
violently wringing his hands, gasped, "Ai!
ai! ai!" and the young peddlers bandied
whispered jokes.</p>

<h2>A SWEAT-SHOP ROMANCE</h2>

<p>Leizer Lipman was one of those contract
tailors who are classed by their hands under
the head of "cockroaches," which&mdash;translating
the term into lay English&mdash;means
that he ran a very small shop, giving employment
to a single team of one sewing-machine
operator, one baster, one finisher,
and one presser.</p>

<p>The shop was one of a suite of three
rooms on the third floor of a rickety old
tenement house on Essex Street, and did the
additional duty of the family's kitchen and
dining-room. It faced a dingy little courtyard,
and was connected by a windowless
bedroom with the parlor, which commanded
the very heart of the Jewish markets. Bundles
of cloth, cut to be made into coats, littered
the floor, lay in chaotic piles by one of
the walls, cumbered Mrs. Lipman's kitchen
table and one or two chairs, and formed, in
a corner, an improvised bed upon which a
dirty two-year-old boy, Leizer's heir apparent,
was enjoying his siesta.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
Dangling against the door or scattered
among the bundles, there were cooking
utensils, dirty linen, Lipman's velvet skull-cap,
hats, shoes, shears, cotton-spools, and
whatnot. A red-hot kitchen stove and a
blazing grate full of glowing flat-irons combined
to keep up the overpowering temperature
of the room, and helped to justify its
nickname of sweat-shop in the literal sense
of the epithet.</p>

<p>Work was rather scarce, but the designer
of the Broadway clothing firm, of whose
army of contractors Lipman was a member,
was a second cousin to the latter's wife, and
he saw to it that his relative's husband was
kept busy. And so operations in Leizer's
shop were in full swing. Heyman, the operator,
with his bared brawny arms, pushed
away at an unfinished coat, over which his
head, presenting to view a wealth of curly
brown hair, hung like an eagle bent on his
prey. He swayed in unison to the rhythmic
whirr of his machine, whose music, supported
by the energetic thumps of Meyer's press-iron,
formed an orchestral accompaniment
to the sonorous and plaintive strains of a
vocal duet performed by Beile, the finisher
girl, and David, the baster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
Leizer was gone to the Broadway firm's
offices, while Zlate, his wife, was out on a
prolonged haggling expedition among the
tradeswomen of Hester Street. This circumstance
gave the hands a respite from the
restrictions usually placed on their liberties
by the presence of the "boss" and the
"Missis," and they freely beguiled the tedium
and fatigue of their work, now by
singing, now by a bantering match at the
expense of their employer and his wife, or
of each other.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose you might as well quit,"
said Meyer, a chubby, red-haired, freckled
fellow of forty, emphasizing his remark by
an angry stroke of his iron. "You have
been over that song now fifty times without
taking breath. You make me tired."</p>

<p>"Don't you like it? Stuff up your ears,
then," Beile retorted, without lifting her
head from the coat in her lap.</p>

<p>"Why, I do like it, first-rate and a half,"
Meyer returned, "but when you keep your
mouth shut I like it better still, see?"</p>

<p>The silvery tinkle of Beile's voice, as she
was singing, thrilled Heyman with delicious
melancholy, gave him fresh relish for his
work, and infused additional activity into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
his limbs: and as her singing was interrupted
by the presser's gibe, he involuntarily
stopped his machine with that annoying feeling
which is experienced by dancers when
brought to an unexpected standstill by an
abrupt pause of the music.</p>

<p>"And you?"&mdash;he addressed himself to
Meyer, facing about on his chair with an
irritated countenance. "It's all right enough
when you speak, but it is much better when
you hold your tongue. Don't mind him,
Beile. Sing away!" he then said to the
girl, his dazzlingly fair face relaxing and his
little eyes shutting into a sweet smile of self-confident
gallantry.</p>

<p>"You had better stick to your work, Heyman.
Why, you might have made half a
cent the while," Meyer fired back, with an
ironical look, which had reference to the
operator's reputation of being a niggardly
fellow, who overworked himself, denied himself
every pleasure, and grew fat by feasting
his eyes on his savings-bank book.</p>

<p>A sharp altercation ensued, which drifted
to the subject of Heyman's servile conduct
toward his employer.</p>

<p>"It was you, wasn't it," Meyer said, "who
started that collection for a birthday present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
for the boss? Of course, we couldn't help
chipping in. Why is David independent?"</p>

<p>"Did I compel you?" Heyman rejoined.
"And am I to blame that it was to me that
the boss threw out the hint about that present?
It is so slack everywhere, and you
ought to thank God for the steady job you
have here," he concluded, pouncing down
upon the coat on his machine.</p>

<p>David, who had also cut short his singing,
kept silently plying his needle upon pieces
of stuff which lay stretched on his master's
dining-table. Presently he paused to adjust
his disheveled jet-black hair, with his fingers
for a comb, and to wipe the perspiration
from his swarthy, beardless and typically
Israelitic face with his shirt-sleeve.</p>

<p>While this was in progress, his languid
hazel eyes were fixed on the finisher girl.
She instinctively became conscious of his
gaze, and raised her head from the needle.
Her fresh buxom face, flushed with the heat
of the room and with exertion, shone full
upon the young baster. Their eyes met.
David colored, and, to conceal his embarrassment,
he asked: "Well, is he going to
raise your wages?"</p>

<p>Beile nodded affirmatively, and again
plunged her head into her work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
"He is? So you will now get five dollars
a week. I am afraid you will be putting on
airs now, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Do you begrudge me? Then I am willing
to swap wages with you. I'll let you
have my five dollars, and I'll take your
twelve dollars every week."</p>

<p>Lipman's was a task shop, and, according
to the signification which the term has in the
political economy of the sweating world, his
operator, baster, and finisher, while nominally
engaged at so much a week, were in reality
paid by the piece, the economical week being
determined by a stipulated quantity of made-up
coats rather than by a fixed number of
the earth's revolutions around its axis; for
the sweat-shop day will not coincide with the
solar day unless a given amount of work be
accomplished in its course. As to the
presser, he is invariably a piece-worker, pure
and simple.</p>

<p>For a more lucid account of the task system
in the tailoring branch, I beg to refer
the reader to David, although his exposition
happens to be presented rather in the form
of a satire on the subject. Indeed, David,
while rather inclined to taciturnity, was an
inveterate jester, and what few remarks he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
indulged in during his work would often
cause boisterous merriment among his shop-mates,
although he delivered them with a
nonchalant manner and with the same look
of good-humored irony, mingled in strange
harmony with a general expression of gruffness,
which his face usually wore.</p>

<p>"My twelve dollars every week?" David
echoed. "Oh, I see; you mean a week of
twelve days!" And his needle resumed its
duck-like sport in the cloth.</p>

<p>"How do you make it out?" Meyer demanded,
in order to elicit a joke from the
witty young man by his side.</p>

<p>"Of course, <em>you</em> don't know how to make
that out. But ask Heyman or Beile. The
three of us do."</p>

<p>"Tell him, then, and he will know too,"
Beile urged, laughing in advance at the
expected fun.</p>

<p>A request coming from the finisher was&mdash;yet
unknown to herself&mdash;resistless with
David, and in the present instance it loosened
his tongue.</p>

<p>"Well, I get twelve dollars a week, and
Heyman fourteen. Now a working week
has six days, but&mdash;hem&mdash;that 'but' gets
stuck in my throat&mdash;but a day is neither a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
Sunday nor a Monday nor anything unless
we make twelve coats. The calendars are a
lot of liars."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"They say a day has twenty-four hours.
That's a bluff. A day has twelve coats."</p>

<p>Beile's rapturous chuckle whetted his
appetite for persiflage, and he went on:&mdash;</p>

<p>"They read the Tuesday Psalm in the
synagogue this morning, but I should have
read the Monday one."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"You see, Meyer's wife will soon come
up with his dinner, and here I have still two
coats to make of the twelve that I got yesterday.
So it's still Monday with me. My
Tuesday won't begin before about two
o'clock this afternoon."</p>

<p>"How much will you make this week?"
Meyer questioned.</p>

<p>"I don't expect to finish more than four
days' work by the end of the week, and will
only get eight dollars on Friday&mdash;that is,
provided the Missis has not spent our wages
by that time. So when it's Friday I'll call
it Wednesday, see?"</p>

<p>"When I am married," he added, after a
pause, "and the old woman asks me for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
Sabbath expenses, I'll tell her it is only
Wednesday&mdash;it isn't yet Friday&mdash;and I
have no money to give her."</p>

<p>David relapsed into silence, but mutely
continued his burlesque, hopping from subject
to subject.</p>

<p>David thought himself a very queer fellow.
He often wondered at the pranks
which his own imagination was in the habit
of playing, and at the grotesque combinations
it frequently evolved. As he now
stood, leaning forward over his work, he
was striving to make out how it was that
Meyer reminded him of the figure "7."</p>

<p>"What nonsense!" he inwardly exclaimed,
branding himself for a crank. "And what
does Heyman look like?" his mind queried,
as though for spite. He contemplated the
operator askance, and ran over all the digits
of the Arabic system, and even the whole
Hebrew alphabet, in quest of a counterpart
to the young man, but failed to find anything
suitable. "His face would much better become
a girl," he at last decided, and mentally
proceeded to envelop Heyman's head in
Beile's shawl. But the proceeding somehow
stung him, and he went on to meditate upon
the operator's chunky nose. "No, that nose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
is too ugly for a girl. It wants a little
planing. It's an unfinished job, as it were.
But for that nose Heyman would really be
the nice fellow they say he is. His snow-white
skin&mdash;his elegant heavy mustache&mdash;yes,
if he did not have that nose he would
be all right," he maliciously joked in his
heart. "And I, too, would be all right if
Heyman were noseless," he added, transferring
his thoughts to Beile, and wondering
why she looked so sweet. "Why, <em>her</em> nose
is not much of a beauty, either. Entirely
too straight, and too&mdash;too foolish. Her
eyes look old and as if constantly on the
point of bursting into tears. Ah, but then
her lips&mdash;that kindly smile of theirs, coming
out of one corner of her mouth!" And
a strong impulse seized him to throw himself
on those lips and to kiss them, which
he did mentally, and which shot an electric
current through his whole frame. And at
this Beile's old-looking eyes both charmed
and pierced him to the heart, and her nose,
far from looking foolish, seemed to contemplate
him contemptuously, triumphantly, and
knowingly, as if it had read his thoughts.</p>

<p>While this was going on in David's brain
and heart, Beile was taken up with Heyman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
and with their mutual relations. His attentions
to her were an open secret. He did
not go out of his way to conceal them. On
the contrary, he regularly escorted her home
after work, and took her out to balls and
picnics&mdash;a thing involving great sacrifices
to a fellow who trembled over every cent
he spent, and who was sure to make up for
these losses to his pocket-book by foregoing
his meals. While alone with her in the
hallway of her mother's residence, his voice
would become so tender, so tremulous, and
on several occasions he even addressed her
by the endearing form of Beilinke. And
yet all this had been going on now for over
three months, and he had not as much as
alluded to marriage, nor even bought her
the most trifling present.</p>

<p>Her mother made life a burden to her, and
urged the point-blank declaration of the alternative
between a formal engagement and
an arrest for breach of promise. Beile would
have died rather than make herself the heroine
of such a sensation; and, besides, the
idea of Heyman handcuffed to a police detective
was too terrible to entertain even for
a moment.</p>

<p>She loved him. She liked his blooming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
face, his gentleman-like mustache, the quaint
jerk of his head, as he walked; she was
fond of his company; she was sure she
was in love with him: her confidant, her fellow
country girl and playmate, who had recently
married Meyer, the presser, had told
her so.</p>

<p>But somehow she felt disappointed. She
had imagined love to be a much sweeter
thing. She had thought that a girl in love
admired <em>everything</em> in the object of her
affections, and was blind to all his faults.
She had heard that love was something
like a perpetual blissful fluttering of the
heart.</p>

<p>"I feel as if something was melting here,"
a girl friend who was about to be married
once confided to her, pointing to her heart.
"You see, it aches and yet it is so sweet at
the same time." And here she never feels
anything melting, nor can she help disliking
some things about Heyman. His smile
sometimes appears to her fulsome. Ah,
if he did not shut his eyes as he does when
smiling! That he is so slow to spend
money is rather one of the things she likes
in him. If he ever marries her she will be
sure to get every cent of his wages. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
then when they are together at a ball he
never goes up to the bar to treat her to a
glass of soda, as the other fellows do to their
girls, and all he offers her is an apple or a
pear, which he generally stops to buy on the
street on their way to the dancing-hall. Is
she in love at all? Maybe she is mistaken?
But no! he is after all so dear to her. She
must have herself to blame. It is not in
vain that her mother calls her a whimpering,
nagging thing, who gives no peace to
herself nor to anybody around her. But
why does he not come out with his declaration?
Is it because he is too stingy to wish
to support a wife? Has he been making a
fool of her? What does he take her for,
then?</p>

<p>In fairness to Heyman, it must be stated
that on the point of his intentions, at least,
her judgment of him was without foundation,
and her misgivings gratuitous. Pecuniary
considerations had nothing to do with his
slowness in proposing to her. And if she
could have watched him and penetrated his
mind at the moments when he examined his
bank-book,&mdash;which he did quite often,&mdash;she
would have ascertained that little images of
herself kept hovering before his eyes between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
the figures of its credit columns, and that the
sum total conjured up to him a picture of
prospective felicity with her for a central
figure.</p>

<p>Poor thing; she did not know that when
he lingeringly fondled her hand, on taking
his leave in the hallway, the proposal lay on
the tip of his tongue, and that lacking the
strength to relieve himself of its burden he
every time left her, consoling himself that
the moment was inopportune, and that "to-morrow
he would surely settle it." She did
not know that only two days ago the idea
had occurred to him to have recourse to the
aid of a messenger in the form of a lady's
watch, and that while she now sat worrying
lest she was being made a fool of, the golden
emissary lay in Heyman's vest-pocket, throbbing
in company with his heart with impatient
expectation of the evening hour,
which had been fixed for the delivery of its
message.</p>

<p>"I shall let mother speak to him," Beile
resolved, in her musings over her needle.
She went on to picture the scene, but at this
point her meditations were suddenly broken
by something clutching and pulling at her
hair. It was her employer's boy. He had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
just got up from his after-dinner nap, and,
for want of any other occupation, he passed
his dirty little hand into her raven locks.</p>

<p>"He is practicing to be a boss," observed
David, whose attention was attracted to the
spectacle by the finisher's shriek.</p>

<p>Beile's voice brought Heyman to his feet,
and disentangling the little fellow's fingers
from the girl's hair, he fell to "plastering
his nasty cheeks for him," as he put it. At
this juncture the door opened to admit the
little culprit's father. Heyman skulked
away to his seat, and, burying his head in
his work, he proceeded to drown, in the
whir-r, whir-r of his machine, the screams
of the boy, who would have struck a much
higher key had his mamma happened on the
spot.</p>

<p>Lipman took off his coat, substituted his
greasy velvet skull-cap for his derby, and
lighting a cigar with an air of good-natured
business-like importance, he advanced to
Meyer's corner and fell to examining a
coat.</p>

<p>"And what does <em>he</em> look like?" David
asked himself, scrutinizing his task-master.
"Like a broom with its stick downward,"
he concluded to his own satisfaction. "And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
his snuff-box?"&mdash;meaning Lipman's huge
nose&mdash;"A perfect fiddle!&mdash;And his mouth?
Deaf-mutes usually have such mouths. And
his beard? He has entirely too much of it,
and it's too pretty for his face. It must
have got there by mistake."</p>

<p>Presently the door again flew open, and
Mrs. Lipman, heavily loaded with parcels
and panting for breath, came waddling in
with an elderly couple in tow.</p>

<p>"Greenhorns," Meyer remarked. "Must
be fellow townspeople of hers&mdash;lately arrived."</p>

<p>"She looks like a tea-kettle, and she is
puffing like one, too," David thought, after
an indifferent gaze at the newcomers, looking
askance at his stout, dowdyish little
"Missis." "No," he then corrected himself,
"she rather resembles a broom with its stick
out. That's it! And wouldn't it be a
treat to tie a stick to her head and to sweep
the floor with the horrid thing! And her
mouth? Why, it makes me think she does
nothing but sneeze."</p>

<p>"Here is Leizer! Leizer, look at the
guests I have brought you!" Zlate exclaimed,
as she threw down her bundles.
"Be seated, Reb Avrom; be seated, Basse.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
This is our factory," she went on, with a
smile of mixed welcome and triumph, after
the demonstrative greetings were over. "It
is rather too small, isn't it? but we are going
to move into larger and better quarters."</p>

<p>Meyer was not mistaken. Zlate's visitors
had recently arrived from her birthplace, a
poor town in Western Russia, where they
had occupied a much higher social position
than their present hostess, and Mrs. Lipman,
coming upon them on Hester Street,
lost no time in inviting them to her house,
in order to overwhelm them with her American
achievements.</p>

<p>"Come, I want to show you my parlor,"
Mrs. Lipman said, beckoning to her country
people, and before they were given an opportunity
to avail themselves of the chairs
which she had offered them, they were towed
into the front room.</p>

<p>When the procession returned, Leizer, in
obedience to an order from his wife, took
Reb Avrom in charge and proceeded to initiate
him into the secrets of the "American
style of tailoring."</p>

<p>"Oh, my!" Zlate suddenly ejaculated,
with a smile. "I came near forgetting to
treat. Beilke!" she then addressed herself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
to the finisher girl in a tone of imperious
nonchalance, "here is a nickel. Fetch two
bottles of soda from the grocery."</p>

<p>"Don't go, Beile!" David whispered
across his table, perceiving the girl's reluctance.</p>

<p>It was not unusual for Beile to go on an
errand for the wife of her employer, though
she always did it unwillingly, and merely
for fear of losing her place; but then Zlate
generally exacted these services as a favor.
In the present instance, however, Beile felt
mortally offended by her commanding tone,
and the idea of being paraded before the
strangers as a domestic cut her to the quick,
as a stream of color rushing into her face
indicated. Nevertheless the prospect of
having to look for a job again persuaded
her to avoid trouble with Zlate, and she was
about to reach out her hand for the coin,
when David's exhortation piqued her sense
of self-esteem, and she went on with her
sewing. Heyman, who, being interrupted in
his work by the visitor's inspection, was a
witness of the scene, at this point turned his
face from it, and cringing by his machine,
he made a pretense of busying himself with
the shuttle. His heart shrank with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
awkwardness of his situation, and he nervously
grated his teeth and shut his eyes,
awaiting still more painful developments.
His veins tingled with pity for his sweetheart
and with deadly hatred for David.
What could he do? he apologized to himself.
Isn't it foolish to risk losing a steady
job at this slack season on account of such
a trifle as fetching up a bottle of soda?
What business has David to interfere?</p>

<p>"You are not deaf, are you? I say go
and bring some soda, quick!" Mrs. Lipman
screamed, fearing lest she was going
too far.</p>

<p>"Don't budge, Beile!" the baster
prompted, with fire in his eyes.</p>

<p>Beile did not.</p>

<p>"I say go!" Zlate thundered, reddening
like a beet, to use a phrase in vogue with
herself.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Zlate," Basse interposed,
to relieve the embarrassing situation. "We
just had tea."</p>

<p>"Never mind. It is not worth the
trouble," Avrom chimed in.</p>

<p>But this only served to lash Zlate into a
greater fury, and unmindful of consequences,
she strode up to the cause of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
predicament, and tearing the coat out of her
hands, she squeaked out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Either fetch the soda, or leave my shop
at once!"</p>

<p>Heyman was about to say, to do something,
he knew not exactly what, but his
tongue seemed seized with palsy, the blood
turned chill in his veins, and he could neither
speak nor stir.</p>

<p>Leizer, who was of a quiet, peaceful disposition,
and very much under the thumb of
his wife, stood nervously smiling and toying
with his beard.</p>

<p>David grew ashen pale, and trembling
with rage he said aloud and in deliberate
accents:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't mind her, Beile, and never worry.
Come along. I'll find you a better job.
This racket won't work, Missis. Your
friends see through it, anyhow, don't you?"
he addressed himself to the newcomers.
"She wanted to brag to you. That's what
she troubled you for. She showed off her
parlor carpet to you, didn't she? But did
she tell you that it had been bought on the
installment plan, and that the custom-peddler
threatened to take it away unless she
paid more regularly?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
"Leizer! are you&mdash;are you drunk?"
Mrs. Lipman gasped, her face distorted with
rage and desperation.</p>

<p>"Get out of here!" Leizer said, in a
tone which would have been better suited to
a cordial invitation.</p>

<p>The command was unnecessary, however,
for by this time David was buttoning up his
overcoat, and had his hat on. Involuntarily
following his example, Beile also dressed to
go. And as she stood in her new beaver
cloak and freshly trimmed large old hat by
the side of her discomfited commander,
Basse reflected that it was the finisher girl
who looked like a lady, with Zlate for her
servant, rather than the reverse.</p>

<p>"See that you have our wages ready for
Friday, and all the arrears, too!" was David's
parting shot as the two left the room
with a defiant slam of the door.</p>

<p>"That's like America!" Zlate remarked,
with an attempt at a scornful smile. "The
meanest beggar girl will put on airs."</p>

<p>"Why <em>should</em> one be ordered about like
that? She is no servant, is she?" Heyman
murmured, addressing the corner of the
room, and fell to at his machine to smother
his misery.</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
When his day's work was over, Heyman's
heart failed him to face Beile, and although
he was panting to see her, he did not call at
her house. On the following morning he
awoke with a headache, and this he used as
a pretext to himself for going to bed right
after supper.</p>

<p>On the next evening he did betake himself
to the Division Street tenement house,
where his sweetheart lived with her mother
on the top floor, but on coming in front of
the building his courage melted away.
Added to his cowardly part in the memorable
scene of two days before, there now
was his apparent indifference to the finisher,
as manifested by his two evenings' absence
at such a critical time. He armed himself
with a fib to explain his conduct. But all
in vain; he could not nerve himself up to
the terrible meeting. And so day after day
passed, each day increasing the barrier to
the coveted visit.</p>

<p>At last, one evening, about a fortnight
after the date of Mrs. Lipman's fiasco, Heyman,
forgetting to lose courage, as it were,
briskly mounted the four flights of stairs of
the Division Street tenement. As he was
about to rap for admission he was greeted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
by a sharp noise within of something, like a
china plate or a bowl, being dashed to pieces
against the very door which he was going to
open. The noise was followed by merry
voices: "Good luck! Good luck!" and
there was no mistaking its meaning. There
was evidently an engagement party inside.
The Rabbi had just read the writ of betrothment,
and it was the mutual pledges of the
contracting parties which were emphasized
by the "breaking of the plate."</p>

<p>Presently Heyman heard exclamations
which dissipated his every doubt as to the
identity of the chief actors in the ceremony
which had just been completed within.</p>

<p>"Good luck to you, David! Good luck
to you, Beile! May you live to a happy old
age together!" "Feige, why don't you take
some cake? Don't be so bashful!" "Here
is luck!" came through the door, piercing
a muffled hum inside.</p>

<p>Heyman was dumbfounded, and with
his head swimming, he made a hasty retreat.</p>

<p>Ever since the tragi-comical incident at
Lipman's shop, Heyman was not present to
Beile's thoughts except in the pitiful, cowering
attitude in which he had sat through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
that awful scene by his machine. She was
sure she hated him now. And yet her heart
was, during the first few days, constantly
throbbing with the expectation of his visit;
and as she settled in her mind that even if
he came she would have nothing to do with
him, her deeper consciousness seemed to
say, with a smile of conviction: "Oh no,
you know you would not refuse him. You
wouldn't risk to remain an old maid, would
you?" The idea of his jilting her harrowed
her day and night. Did he avail
himself of her leaving Lipman's shop to
back out of the proposal which was naturally
expected of him, but which he never
perhaps contemplated? Did he make game
of her?</p>

<p>When a week had elapsed without Heyman's
putting in an appearance, she determined
to let her mother see a lawyer about
breach-of-promise proceedings. But an image,
whose outlines had kept defining themselves
in her heart for several days past,
overruled this decision. It was the image
of a pluckier fellow than Heyman&mdash;of one
with whom there was more protection in
store for a wife, who inspired her with more
respect and confidence, and, what is more,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
who seemed on the point of proposing to
her.</p>

<p>It was the image of David. The young
baster pursued his courtship with a quiet
persistency and a suppressed fervor which
was not long in winning the girl's heart.
He found work for her and for himself in
the same shop; saw her home every evening;
regularly came after supper to take her out
for a walk, in the course of which he would
treat her to candy and invite her to a coffee
saloon,&mdash;a thing which Heyman had never
done;&mdash;kept her chuckling over his jokes;
and at the end of ten days, while sitting by
her side in Central Park, one night, he said,
in reply to her remark that it was so dark
that she knew not where she was:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'll tell you where you are&mdash;guess."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Here, in my heart, and keeping me
awake nights, too. Say, Beile, what have I
ever done to you to have my rest disturbed
by you in that manner?"</p>

<p>Her heart was beating like a sledge-hammer.
She tried to laugh, as she returned:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;You can never stop
making fun, can you?"</p>

<p>"Fun? Do you want me to cry? I will,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
gladly, if I only know that you will agree to
have an engagement party," he rejoined,
deeply blushing under cover of the darkness.</p>

<p>"When?" she questioned, the word
crossing her lips before she knew it.</p>

<p>"On my part, to-morrow."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span></p>

<h2>CIRCUMSTANCES</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Tatyana Markovna Lurie had just
received the July number of "Russian
Thought," and was in a flurry. She felt
like devouring all the odd dozen of articles
in the voluminous book at once; and the
patience failing her to cut the leaves, she
fell to prying between them on the rocking-chair
which she had drawn up close to one
of the two windows of the best room.</p>

<p>Altogether, the residence of the Luries
consisted of three small uncarpeted and
scantily furnished apartments, and occupied
a fourth of the top floor of a veteran tenement
house on Madison Street.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Tatyana Markovna settled on
an extensive review of a new translation of
Guy de Maupassant's stories. But here
again she was burning to glance over the
beginning, the middle, and the end of the
article simultaneously. And so she sat,
feverishly skipping and hopping over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
lines, until a thought expressed by the critic,
and which struck her as identical with one
she had set forth in a recent discussion with
her husband, finally fixed her attention and
overspread her youthful little face with radiance.
She was forerelishing her triumph
when, upon Boris's return from work, she
would show him the passage; for in their
debate he had made light of her contention,
and met her irresolute demurrer with the
patronizing and slightly ironical tone which
he usually took while discussing book questions
with her.</p>

<p>But at the thought of Boris she suddenly
remembered her soup, and growing pale
she put the magazine aside, and darted into
the semi-obscurity of the kitchen.</p>

<p>Tatyana, or Tanya, as her husband would
fondly call her, was the daughter of a merchant
and Hebrew writer in Kieff, who
usually lost upon his literary ventures what
he would save from his business. It was
not long after she had graduated from one
of the female gymnasiums of her native
city that she met Boris Lurie, then a law
student at the University of St. Vladimir.</p>

<p>He was far from being what Russian college
girls would call "a dear little soul;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
for he was tall and lank, awkwardly near-sighted,
and rather plain of feature, and the
scar over his left eyebrow, too, added anything
but beauty to his looks. But for all
that, the married young women of his circle
voted him decidedly interesting.</p>

<p>Tanya was attracted by his authoritative
tone and rough sort of impetuosity upon
discussing social or literary topics; by his
reputation of being one of the best-read
men at the university, as well as a leading
spirit in student "circles," and by the perfect
Russian way in which his coal-black
hair fell over his commanding forehead.
As to him, he was charmed by that in her
which had charmed many a student before
him: the delicate freshness of her pink
complexion, which, by the time we first find
her in the Madison Street tenement, had
only partially faded; the enthusiastic smile
beaming from her every feature as she
spoke; and the way her little nose, the least
bit retrouss, would look upward, and her
beautiful hazel eyes would assume a look of
childlike curiosity, while she was listening
to her interlocutor.</p>

<p>They were married immediately after his
graduation, with the intention of settling in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
Kremenchug, where he had every prospect
of a large practice. But when he presented
himself for admission to the bar, as a "private
attorney," he encountered obstacle after
obstacle. He tried another district, but with
no better success. By that time it had become
clear that the government was bent
upon keeping the Jews out of the forensic
profession, although it had not officially
placed it upon the list of vocations proscribed
to their race.</p>

<p>After a year of peregrination and petitioning
he came, a bundle of nerves, to Jitomir
to make a last attempt in the province
of Volyn.</p>

<p>A high judiciary officer who received him
rather politely, made, in the course of their
interview, the semi-jocular remark that the
way to the bar lay through the baptismal
font.</p>

<p>"Villain!" Lurie thundered, his fists
clenched and his eyes flashing.</p>

<p>Luckily the functionary was a cool-headed
old man who knew how to avoid unsavory
publicity. And so, when Lurie defiantly
started to stalk out of the room, he was not
stopped.</p>

<p>A month or two later, Boris and Tanya
arrived in New York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>It was near seven o'clock when Boris
came from the pearl-button factory where he
earned, at piece-work, from six to seven
dollars a week. As Tanya heard his footsteps
through the door she sprang to her
feet and, with a joyous gleam in her eye, she
ran out to meet him at the head of the stairs.
In her delight she at once forgot the Maupassant
article.</p>

<p>After an affectionate greeting she said,
with burlesque supplication:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't get angry, Borya, but I am afraid
I have flunked on my soup again."</p>

<p>His fatigued smile expanded.</p>

<p>"The worst of it," she pursued, "is the
fact that this time my negligence resulted
from something which is against you. Yes,
I have got something that will show you
that Mr. Boris has not monopolized all the
wisdom in the world; that other people know
something, too. Yes, sir!" she beamingly
concluded, in English.</p>

<p>"You must have received the July number,
have you?" he burst out, flushing with
anticipated delight.</p>

<p>"Not your booseeness" (business), she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
replied in English, playfully pronouncing
the words as in Russian. "You know you
can't get it before supper is over; so what is
the use asking?" she added, in the tongue of
her native country. With which she briskly
busied herself about the table and the stove,
glowing with happiness, every inch of her a
woman in the long-awaited presence of the
man she loves.</p>

<p>Boris's shabby working clothes, his few
days' growth of beard and general appearance
of physical exhaustion vainly combined,
as it were, to extinguish the light of culture
and intellectuality from his looks; they
only succeeded in adding the tinge of martyrdom
to them. As to Tatyana, she had got
so far habituated to the change that she was
only occasionally aware of it. And when
she was, it would move her to pity and
quicken her love for him. At such moments
his poor workaday clothes would appear to
her as something akin to the prison garb of
the exiled student in Siberia.</p>

<p>"Let me just take a glance at the table
of contents," he begged, brokenly, washing
himself at the sink.</p>

<p>"After supper."</p>

<p>"Then do you tell me what there is to
read. Anything interesting?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
"After supper."</p>

<p>"Or is it that you begrudge me the few
minutes' talk we have together?" she resumed
more earnestly, after a slight pause.
"The whole day I am all alone, and when
he comes he plunges into some book or other
or falls asleep like a murdered man. All
there remains is the half hour at supper; so
that, too, he would willingly deprive me of."</p>

<p>It was Tanya's standing grievance, and
she would deliver herself of it on the slightest
provocation, often quite irrelevantly.</p>

<p>After supper she read to him the passage
which she regarded as an indorsement of her
view upon Maupassant. When she had finished
and turned to him a face full of triumphant
inquiry, she was rather disappointed
by the lukewarm readiness of his surrender.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. It is rather an interesting
point," he remarked lazily.</p>

<p>He was reclining on the stiff carpet-covered
lounge in the front room, while she was
seated in the rocker, in front of him. It
flashed across her mind that such unusual
tractability in him might augur some concession
to be exacted from her. She flew
into a mild little passion in advance, but
made no inquiries, and only said, with good-natured
sarcasm:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
"Of course, once it is printed in 'Russian
Thought,' it is 'rather an interesting point,'
but when it was only Tanya who made it,
why then it was mere rubbish."</p>

<p>"You know I never said it was rubbish,
Tanya," he returned deprecatingly.</p>

<p>After a slight pause, he resumed listlessly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Besides, I am sick of these 'interesting
points.' They have been the ruin of us,
Tanychka; they eat us up alive, these 'interesting
points'&mdash;the deuce grab them. If
I cared less about 'interesting points'"&mdash;he
articulated the two words with venomous
relish&mdash;"and a little more about your future
and mine, I might not now have to stick in
a button factory."</p>

<p>She listened to him with an amused air,
and when he paused, she said flippantly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We have heard it before."</p>

<p>"So much the worse for both of us. If
you at least took a more sober view of
things! Seriously, Tanya, you ought to
make life a burden to me until I begin to do
something to get out of this devilish&mdash;of
this villainous, unpardonable position."</p>

<p>"You should have married Cecilia Trotzky,
then," she said, laughing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
Cecilia Trotzky was the virago among
the educated Russo-Jewish immigrants, who
form a numerous colony within a colony in
the Ghetto of New York. She was described
as a woman who had placed her husband in
a medical college, then made a point of sending
him supperless to bed every time he
failed to study his lessons, and later, when
he was practicing, fixed the fees with his
patients.</p>

<p>"Well, what is the use of joking?" he
said gloomily, suppressing a smile. "Every
illiterate nonentity," he went on, letting the
words filter through his teeth with languid
bitterness, "every shop clerk, who at home
hardly knew there was such a thing as a
university in the world, goes to college here;
and I am serving the community by supplying
it with pearl buttons for six dollars a
week. Would this were regular, at least!
But it is not. I forgot to tell you, but we
may again have a slack season, Tanya. Oh!
I will not let things go on like this. If I
don't begin to do something at once, I shall
send a bullet through my forehead. You
may laugh, but this time it is not idle talk.
From this day on I shall be a different man.
I have a plan; I have considered everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
carefully. If we wish to get rid of our beggarly
position, of this terrible feeling of insecurity
and need," he proceeded, as he raised
himself to a sitting posture, his voice gathering
energy and his features becoming contorted
with an expression of disgust; "if we
really mean to free ourselves from this constant
trembling lest I lose my job, from
these excursions to the pawn shops&mdash;laugh
away! laugh away!&mdash;but, as I say, if we
seriously wish to make it possible for me to
enter some college here, we must send all
literature and magazines and all gush about
Russia to the deuce, and do as others do. I
have a splendid plan. Everything depends
upon you, Tanya."</p>

<p>At this the childlike look of curiosity
came into her face. But he seemed in no
hurry to come to the point.</p>

<p>"People who hang about pawn shops
have no right to 'interesting points' and
Guy de Maupassant and that sort of luxury.
Poverty is a crime! Well, but from now
on, everything will be different. Listen,
Tanychka; the greatest trouble is the rent,
is it not? It eats up the larger part of my
wages&mdash;that is, provided I work full time;
and you know how we tremble and are on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
the verge of insanity each time the first of
the month is drawing near. If we wish to
achieve something, we must be satisfied to
pinch ourselves and to put up with some inconvenience.
Above all, we must not forget
that I am a common workingman. Well,
every workingman's family around here
keeps a boarder or two; let us also take one.
There is no way out of it, Tanya."</p>

<p>He uttered the concluding words with
studied nonchalance, but without daring to
look her in the face.</p>

<p>"Borya!" she exclaimed, with a bewildered
air.</p>

<p>Her manner angered him.</p>

<p>"There, now! I expected as much!" he
said irascibly. And continuing in softer accents,
he forced her to listen to the details
of his project. The boarder's pay would
nearly come up to their rent. If they lived
more economically than now they could save
up enough for his first year's tuition at a
New York college, or, as a stepping-stone,
for a newspaper stand. Free from worry
about their rent, he would be in a fitter
mood to study English after work. In
course of time he would know the language
enough to teach it to the uneducated workingmen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
of the Jewish quarter; and so he
would be liberated from his factory yoke, as
many an immigrant of his class had been.
Dalsky, a friend of theirs, and a former
classmate of Boris's, who was studying medicine,
earned his living by giving such lessons
in English, and, by the way, he was
now looking for a lodging. Why should
they not offer him their parlor? They
could do with the kitchen and the bedroom.
Besides, Dalsky would be one of the family,
and would have only partial use of the parlor.</p>

<p>As the plan assumed a personified form
in her mind&mdash;the face of a definite boarder&mdash;her
realization of its horrors was so keen
that she shut her ears and begged Boris to
take pity on her and desist. Whereupon
he flew into a rage and charged her with
nursing aristocratic instincts which in their
present position they could not afford. She
retorted, tearfully, that she was ready to put
up with any amount of additional work and
discomfort, but that she did not care to have
a "constant cataract on the eye."</p>

<p>"God knows you give me little enough of
your company, as it is. I must have tired
you capitally, if you seek somebody to talk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
to and to save you from being alone with
me."</p>

<p>"You know it is the rankest nonsense you
are saying!" he flamed out. "And what is
the use crying like that? As if I took a
delight in the whole affair! Cry to our
circumstances, not to me. Circumstances,
circumstances, Tanya!" he repeated, with
pleading vehemence.</p>

<p>Little by little he relented, however, and
eventually he promised never to mention
the matter again, although inwardly both of
them felt that he would. He sat by her
side on the lounge, fondling her little hands
and murmuring love, when suddenly bending
upon him an imploring face, she said,
in a tremulous, tearful voice: "Borinka,
dear! I shall also go to some factory. We
will get along without boarders," with which
she fell upon his shoulder in a fit of heartrending
sobbing.</p>

<p>He clasped her to him, whispering: "You
know, my angel, that I would commit suicide
before letting you go to work. Don't
worry, my joy, we <em>will</em> get along without
boarders."</p>

<p>"I want no strangers to hang around the
house all the time; I want to be with you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
alone, I want nobody, nobody, nobody else
in the world!" she said, pressing him tightly
to her heart.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>On the following evening, as Boris was
musingly trudging on his way home, after
work, it suddenly came over him that his
manner with the foreman of the shop was
assuming a rather obsequious nature. Work
was scarce, and the distribution of it was, to
a considerable extent, a matter of favoritism.
He recalled how the Czech foreman, half
tipsy with beer, had been making some stupid
efforts at being witty, and how he, Boris
Lurie, standing by, in greedy expectation of
work, had smiled a broad, ingratiating smile
of approbation. At the moment he had been
so far merged in the surroundings and in
his anxiety about work that he had not been
aware of doing anything unnatural. But now,
as it all came back to him, with inexorable
vividness, and he beheld his own wretched,
artificial smile, he was overcome with disgust.
"Villain!" he broke out at himself,
gnashing his teeth; and at the next moment
he was at the point of bursting into tears
for self-pity. To think of him, who had not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
hesitated to call the president of a Russian
court "rogue" to his face, simpering like a
miserable time-server at every stupidity and
nastiness of a drunken brute! Is that what
circumstances had made of him?</p>

<p>He reached home out of temper, and before
supper was well over he reopened the
discussion of his scheme. It again led to a
slight quarrel, which was again made up by
his surrender, as in the previous instance.</p>

<p>A few days later he was "laid off" for a
fortnight.</p>

<p>To eke out their rent they had to forego
meat. For several consecutive days they
lived on bread and butter and coffee. Boris
grew extremely nervous and irritable.</p>

<p>One morning, coming back from the
pawn shops, Boris, pale and solemn, quietly
laid on the kitchen table the package which
he had under his arm.</p>

<p>"They wouldn't take it," he said almost
in a whisper. "It is not worth anything,
they say."</p>

<p>Tanya only raised at him a meek glance,
and went on with her work. Boris fell to
pacing the front room. They could not
speak.</p>

<p>Presently she stepped up to his side and
said, with rueful tenderness:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
"Well, what is the good of grieving,
Borya?"</p>

<p>Their hands clasped tightly, and their
eyes fixed themselves forlornly on the floor.</p>

<p>"I have promised Dalsky an answer,"
he said, after a little.</p>

<p>"Let him move in," she returned lugubriously,
with a slight shrug of her shoulder,
as if submitting to fate.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>It was about nine in the morning, and
Dalsky, slowly pacing the front room, "Quiz-Compend"
in hand, was reviewing his lesson.
He had a certain dignity and nobleness
of feature which consorted well with
the mysterious pallor of his oval face, and
to which, by the way, his moral complexion
gave him perfect right. Then, too, his middle-sized
form was exceedingly well proportioned.
But for the rest, his looks, like
everything else about him, presented nothing
to produce an impression.</p>

<p>Presently he deliberately closed the book,
carefully placed it on his whatnot, and, his
eye falling upon the little flower-pot on
the window, he noiselessly stepped into the
kitchen, where Tanya was ironing some
trifles on the dining-table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
"What are you looking for, Monsieur
Dalsky?" she inquired amiably, turning her
flushed face to the boarder, who was then
gazing about the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;do not trouble yourself, Tatyana
Markovna&mdash;I have got it," he answered
politely, resting the soft look of his
good gray eyes at her, and showing the enameled
cup which he was carrying to the
water-tap.</p>

<p>"It is high time to give my flower-pot its
breakfast; it must have grown hungry," he
remarked unobtrusively, retracing his steps
to the front room, with the cup half filled
with water.</p>

<p>"It gets good board with you, your little
flower-pot," Tanya returned, in her plaintive
soprano, speaking through the open window,
which sometimes served to separate and
sometimes to connect the kitchen and the
front room. "By the way, it is time for its
master to have its breakfast too. Shall I
set the table, Monsieur Dalsky?"</p>

<p>"All rightissimo!" answered the student
jestingly, with the remotest suggestion of a
chivalrous smile and a bow of his head.</p>

<p>As he ate, she made a playful attempt at
reading the portly textbook, which he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
brought with him. Whenever she happened
to mispronounce an English word, he would
set her right, in a matter-of-fact way; whereupon
she accepted his correction with a
slight blush and a smile, somewhat bashful
and somewhat humorous.</p>

<p>Hardly a fortnight had elapsed since Dalsky
had installed himself and his scanty
effects at the Luries', yet he seemed to have
grown into the family, and the three felt as
if they had dwelt together all their lives.
His presence in the house produced a change
that was at once striking and imperceptible.
When free from college and from teaching,
an hour or two in the morning and a few
hours during the afternoon, he would stay
at home studying or reading, humming, between
whiles, some opera tune, or rolling up
a cigarette and smoking it as he paced up
and down the floor&mdash;all of which he did
softly, unobtrusively, with a sort of pleasing
fluency. Often he would bring from
the street some useful or decorative trifle&mdash;a
match-box, a towel-ring, a bit of bric-a-brac
for the mantelpiece, a flower-pot. At
supper he, Boris and Tanya would have
a friendly chat over the contents of the
newspapers, or the gossip of the colony,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
or some Russian book, although Boris was
apt to monopolize the time for his animadversions
upon the occurrences in the pearl-button
shop, which both Tanya and Dalsky
were beginning to think rather too minute
and uninteresting. "Poor fellow; the pearl-button
environment <em>has</em> eaten him up," the
medical student would say to himself, with
heartfelt commiseration. As to his own
college, he would scarcely ever refer to it.
After supper he usually left for his private
lessons, after which he would perhaps drop
in at the Russian Students' Club; and altogether
his presence did not in the least encroach
upon the privacy of the Luries' life,
while, on the other hand, it seemed to have
breathed an easier and pleasanter atmosphere
into their home.</p>

<p>"Well, was there any ground for making
so much ado?" Boris once said triumphantly.
"We are as much alone as ever, and you
are not lonely all day, into the bargain."</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>Dalsky had come to America with the
definite purpose of studying and then practicing
medicine. He had landed penniless,
yet in a little over two years, and before his
friends in the colony had noticed it, he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
in a position to pay his first year's tuition
and to meet all the other bills of his humble,
but well ordered and, to him, gratifying
living.</p>

<p>He was a normally constituted and well-regulated
young man of twenty-five, a year
or two Lurie's junior. There was nothing
bright nor deep about him, but he was seldom
guilty of a gross want of tact. He
would be the last man to neglect his task
on account of a ball or an interesting book,
yet he was never classed among the "grinds."
He was endowed with a light touch for
things as well as for men, and with that
faculty for ranking high in his class, which,
as we all know, does not always precede distinction
in the school of life. This sort of
people give the world very little, ask of it
still less, but get more than they give.</p>

<p>As he neither intruded too far into other
people's souls, nor allowed others too deep
into his own confidence, he was at peace
with himself and everybody else in the
colony.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Three months more had passed. The
button factory was busy. Boris's hard, uncongenial
toil was deepening its impress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
upon him. When he came from work he
would be so completely fagged out that an
English grammar was out of the question.</p>

<p>He grew more morose every day.</p>

<p>Tanya was becoming irritable with him.</p>

<p>One afternoon after six she was pensively
rocking and humming a Russian folk-song,
one of her little white hands resting on an
open Russian book in her lap. Dalsky was
out, for it was one of those days when he
would stay at college until six and come
home at about the same time as Boris.</p>

<p>Presently she was awakened from her
reverie by the sound of footsteps. The
door opened before she had time to make
out whose they were, and as her eye fell
upon Boris, a shadow of disappointment
flitted across her brow.</p>

<p>Still, at the sight of his overworked face,
her heart was wrung with pity, and she
greeted him with a commiserating, nervous,
exaggerated sort of cordiality.</p>

<p>After a little he took to expounding a
plan, bearing upon their affairs, which he
had conceived while at work. She started
to listen with real interest, but her attention
soon wandered away, and as he went on
she gazed at him blankly and nodded irrelevant
assent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
"What is the use of talking, since you
are not listening anyway?" he said, mildly.</p>

<p>She was about to say softly, "Excuse me,
Borya, say it again, I'll listen," but she
said resentfully, "Suit yourself!"</p>

<p>His countenance fell.</p>

<p>"Any letters from home?" he demanded,
after a while, to break an awkward stillness.</p>

<p>"No," she replied, with an impatient jerk
of her shoulder.</p>

<p>He gave a perplexed shrug, and took up
his grammar.</p>

<p>When Dalsky came he found them plainly
out of sorts with each other. Tanya returned
his "Good health to you," only partly relaxing
the frown on her face. Boris raised
his black head from his book; his brusque
"Good health, Dalsky!" had scarcely left
his lips when his short-sighted eyes again
nearly touched the open grammar.</p>

<p>"You must excuse me; I am really sorry
to have kept you waiting," the boarder apologized,
methodically taking off his overcoat
and gently brushing its velvet collar before
hanging it up, "but I was unavoidably detained
at the lecture, and then I met Stern,
and you know how hard it is to shake oneself
free from him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
"It is not late at all," Tanya observed,
unnecessarily retaining a vestige of the
cloud upon her countenance. "What does
he want, Stern? Some new scheme again?"</p>

<p>"You hit it there, Tatyana Markovna;
and, by the way, you two are to play first
violin in it."</p>

<p>"I?" asked Tanya, her countenance suddenly
blazing up with confused animation.
"What is it?" Boris laid down his book
and pricked up his ears.</p>

<p>"He has unearthed some remarkable dialogue
in Little Russian,&mdash;you know everything
Stern comes across is remarkable.
Well, and he wants the two of you to recite
it or act it&mdash;that's your business&mdash;at the
New Year's gathering."</p>

<p>"What an idiotic plan!" was Boris's
verdict, which his countenance belied unceremoniously.</p>

<p>"Who else is going to participate?" inquired
Tanya.</p>

<p>Fixing his mild gray eyes on his youthful
landlady, Dalsky proceeded to describe the
prospective entertainment in detail. Presently
he grew absent-minded and lost the
thread of a sentence. He noticed that, as
his listener's eyes met his, her gaze became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
unsteady, wandering, as though she were
looked out of countenance.</p>

<p>She confusedly transferred her glance to
his fresh, clean-shaven face and then to
his neatly tied scarf and immaculate shirt
front.</p>

<p>Boris wore a blue flannel shirt, and, as
usual in the middle of the week, his face
was overgrown with what he jocosely called
underbrush. As he had warmed up to Dalsky's
subject and rose to his feet to ply him
with questions, the contrast which the broad,
leaf-shaped gas flame illuminated was striking.
It was one between a worn, wretched
workingman and a trim, fresh-looking college
student.</p>

<p>Supper passed in animated conversation,
as usual. When it was over and the
boarder was gone to his pupils, Boris, reclining
on the lounge, took up his "Dombey and
Son" and Alexandroff's Dictionary. In a
quarter of an hour he was fast asleep and
snoring. It attracted the attention of
Tanya, who sat near by, reading her Russian
novel. She let the book rest on her
lap and fell to contemplating her husband.
His sprawling posture and his snores at once
revolted her and filled her with pity. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
looked at the scar over his eyebrow, and it
pained her; and yet, somehow, she could not
divert her eyes from it. At the same time
she felt a vague reminiscence stirring in her
mind. What was it? She seemed to have
seen or heard or read something somewhere
which had a certain bearing upon the painful
feeling which she was now nursing, in
spite of herself, as she was eyeing the scar
over Boris's eyebrow. What could it be?</p>

<p>A strenuous mental effort brought to her
mind the passage in Tolstoi's novel where
Anna Karenina, after having fallen under
Vronsky's charm, is met by her husband
upon her return to St. Petersburg, whereupon
the first thing that strikes her about
him is the uncouth hugeness of his ears.</p>

<p>It was not the first time her thoughts had
run in this direction. She had repeatedly
caught herself dwelling upon such apparently
silly subjects as the graceful trick
which Dalsky had in knocking off the ashes
of his cigarette, or the way he would look
about the cupboard for the cup with which
he watered his plant, or, again, the soft ring
of his voice as he said, "Tatyana Markovna!"&mdash;the
thoroughly Russian form of
address, not much in vogue in the colony.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
Once, upon touching his flower on the window
sill, she became conscious of a thrill,
deliciously disquieting and as if whispering
something to her. And yet, as the case of
Anna Karenina now came to her mind, as
an illustration of her own position, it smote
her consciousness as a startling discovery.</p>

<p>"And so I am a married woman in love
with another man!" was her first thought;
and with her soul divided between a benumbing
terror and the sweet titillation produced
by a sense of tasting forbidden fruit,
she involuntarily repeated the mental exclamation:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, I am a married woman in love with
another man!"</p>

<p>And with a painful, savage sort of relish
she went on staring at her husband's scar
and listening to his fatigued breathing.
There was a moment when a wave of sympathy
suddenly surged to her heart and
nearly moved her to tears; but at the next
moment it came back to her that it was at
Boris's insistence, and in spite of her sobs,
that the boarder had been taken into the
house; whereupon her heart swelled with a
furious sense of revenge. The image of
Dalsky floated past her mental vision and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
agitated her soul with a novel feeling.
When a moment or two after she threw a
glance at the looking-glass she seemed a
stranger to herself.</p>

<p>"Is this Tanya? Is this the respectable,
decorous young woman that she has been?"
she seemed to soliloquize. "What nonsense;
why not? What have I done? Dalsky
himself does not even suspect anything."
It seemed as if she were listening to the
depth of her own soul for a favorable answer
to her question, and as if the favorable
answer did not come.</p>

<p>She became fearful of herself, and, with
another sudden flow of affection for her husband,
she stepped up to his side to wake
him; but as she came into close contact
with him, the wave of tenderness ebbed
away and she left the room.</p>

<p>"It <em>is</em> nonsense," she decided; "still, I
must invent some pretext for insisting upon
his removal. Then I'll forget him, anyway."</p>

<p>Whether she would have had the courage
to carry out her resolve or not, is not known,
for the task soon became superfluous.</p>

<p>A few days later, as Dalsky was drawing
on his overcoat to leave for his lessons, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
said, rather awkwardly, addressing himself
to both, while looking at Boris:&mdash;</p>

<p>"By the way, I have to tell you something.
I am afraid that devilish college
will make it impossible for me to live downtown."</p>

<p>Both Boris and Tanya grew pale.</p>

<p>"You see," Dalsky pursued, "the lectures
and the work in the dissecting-room
are so scattered throughout the day that I
don't see my way out unless I get a room in
the neighborhood of the college." And to
talk himself out of the embarrassing position,
he went on to explain college affairs
with unnecessary detail.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, however, his whole
explanation, although not based on an untruth,
was not the real cause of his determination
to leave the Luries. He had
known Boris in his better days, and now
sympathized with him and Tanya keenly.
The frequent outbreaks of temper between
husband and wife, and the cloud which
now almost constantly hung over the house,
heavily bore down upon him as a friend,
and made his life there extremely uncomfortable.
At last he had perceived the roving,
nonplussed look in her eyes as their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
glances met. Once become observant in
this direction, he noticed a thousand and
one other little things which seemed to confirm
his suspicion. "Can it be that she is
interested in me?" he said to himself. For
a moment the thought caressed his vanity
and conjured up the image of Tanya in a
novel aspect, which lured him and spoke of
the possibility of reciprocating her feeling&mdash;of
an adventure.</p>

<p>It was on the very next day that he
announced his intention to move.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The house became so dreary to Tanya
that her loneliness during the day frightened
her, though the presence of Boris
irritated her more than ever. She felt as
if some member of the household had died.
Wherever she turned she beheld some trace
of the student; worse than anything else
was the window-plant, which Dalsky had
left behind him. She avoided looking at it,
lest it should thrill her with a crushing sense
of her desolation, of her bereavement, as it
were. Yet, when she was about to remove
it, she had not the heart to do it. She
strayed about like a shadow, and often felt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
as though it were enough to touch her to
make her melt away in tears.</p>

<p>One evening, after an unbearable silence,
succeeding a sharp altercation, Boris asked,
pleadingly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What has become of you, Tanya? I
simply fail to recognize you."</p>

<p>"If you understand, then it is foolish to
ask," she retorted, with a smile of mild sarcasm,
eyeing the floor.</p>

<p>"I understand nothing." But as the
words left his lips, something suddenly
dawned upon him which made his blood
run cold. An array of situations which
had produced an impression upon him, but
which had been lost upon his consciousness,
now uprose in his mind. He grew ashen
pale.</p>

<p>"Well, so much the worse," said she.</p>

<p>"Tell me, and I will know," he rejoined,
with studied irony, while in his heart he
was praying Heaven that his misgivings
might prove baseless.</p>

<p>"Oh! I think you do understand; you
are not so blind." Her voice now sounded
alien in his ears, and she herself seemed to
him suddenly changed&mdash;as if she had in
one moment become transmuted into an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
older, wiser, sterner, and more beautiful,
fiercely beautiful, woman.</p>

<p>"I swear to you that I do not know anything."</p>

<p>"Very well, then; I shall write it," she
said, with a sudden determination, rising to
produce paper, pen, and ink.</p>

<p>"All right," he said, in abject cowardice,
with a meaningless smile.</p>

<p>She wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am your best friend in the world. I
have been thinking, and thinking, and have
arrived at the conclusion that the best thing
for us to do is to part for a time. I do not
blame anybody but myself, but I cannot
help it. I have no moral right to live
with you as long as my mind is constantly
occupied with somebody else. I have struggled
hard to keep out the thoughts of him,
but it is of no avail."</p>

<p>The phlegmatic ticking of the cheap
alarm clock was singing a solemn accompaniment
to the impressive stillness of the
surroundings. Boris, gazing at the corner
of the room with a faint, stolid smile, was
almost trembling. Tanya's face was burning
with excitement. She went on:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I repeat, I have only myself to blame,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
and I am doing my best to struggle out of
this state of mind. But while it lasts, my
false, my dishonest position in this house
aggravates things. I wish to be alone, for
a while, at least. Then, under new conditions,
I hope I shall soon get over it. For
the sake of everything that is good, do not
attempt to persuade me to stay. It is all
thought out and decided. Nor do you need
offer to support me. I have no right to it,
and will not accept it under any circumstances.
I can work and earn my own
living. I am prepared to bear the cross.
Besides, shall I be the only Russian college
woman to work in an American factory?
Above all, do not let anybody know anything&mdash;the
person to whom I have referred
not excluded, <em>of course</em>. I am sure he does
not suspect anything. Do not let him surmise
the cause of it all, if you do not wish
to see my corpse. We can invent some
explanation."</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>It was the early part of a bleak wintry
evening. The interior of Silberman's shop,
crowded with men and women and their
sewing-machines, every bit of space truckled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
up with disorderly piles of finished shirts
or bundles of stuff, was dappled with cheerless
gaslight. The spacious, barn-like loft
rang and trembled with a chaos of mournful
and merry song, vying with the insolent
rattle of the machines. There were synagogue
airs in the chorus and airs of the
Jewish stage; popular American airs, airs
from the dancing schools, and time-honored
airs imported from Russia, Poland, Galicia,
Roumania, Hungary.</p>

<p>Only Tanya was not singing. Bent upon
her machine, in a remote corner, she was
practicing a straight stitch upon some cuttings.
She was making marked progress,
and, flushed with her success, had almost
grown oblivious of the heavy lump at her
heart, and the pricking pain which seemed to
fill her every limb. Presently the girl next
her, who had been rapturously singing "I
have a girl in Baltimore" in a sort of cross-tune
between the song's own melody and the
highly melancholy strains of a Hebrew
prayer, suddenly switched off into one of
the most Russian of Russian folk-songs,&mdash;</p>

This she sang with such an un-Russian
flavor, and pronounced the words with such
a strong Yiddish accent, and so illiterately,
that Tanya gnashed her teeth as if touched
to the quick, and closed her eyes and ears.
The surroundings again grew terrible to
her. Commencement Day at the Kieff
Gymnasium loomed before her imagination,
and she beheld herself one of a group of
blooming young maidens, all in fresh brown
dresses with black aprons, singing that very
song, but in sturdy, ringing, charming Russian.
A cruel anguish choked her. Everybody
and everything about her was so
strange, so hideously hostile, so exile-like!
She once more saw the little home where
she had recently reigned. "How do I happen
here?" she asked herself. She thought
of Boris, and was tempted to run back to
him, to fly into his arms and beg him to establish
a home again. But presently came
the image of Dalsky, neat, polite, dignified,
and noiseless; and she once more fell to
her machine, and with a furious cruelty for
herself, she went on working the treadle.
Whereupon her mind gradually occupied
itself with the New Year's entertainment,
with the way the crowd would be commenting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
upon her separation, and above all, with
her failure to appear on the platform to recite
in Little Russian and to evoke a storm
of applause in the presence of Dalsky.</p>

<p>At that time Boris was on his way from
work, in the direction of Madison Street.
It was the second day after he had cleared
the rooms by selling the furniture and cooking
utensils to the neighbors, who rushed at
them like flies at a drop of molasses. But
he still had his books and some other effects
to remove. When he entered the rooms,
there was light enough from the street to
show the unwonted darkness in them. A
silvery streak fell upon the black aperture
which had the day before been filled with
the pipe of a little parlor stove. This and
the weird gloom of the rest of the apartment
overwhelmed him with distress and terror.
He hastened to light the gas. The dead
emptiness of the three rooms which so recently
had been full of life, the floors littered
with traces of Tanya and their life
together&mdash;every corner and recess had a
look of doleful, mysterious reproach.</p>

<p>For the first time he seemed to realize
what had befallen him; and for the first
time in many years he burst into tears.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
Hot tears they were, and they fell in vehement
drops, as, leaning his wearied form
against the door-post and burying his face
in his arm, he whispered brokenly, "Tanychka!
Tanychka!"</p>

<h2>A GHETTO WEDDING</h2>

<p>Had you chanced to be in Grand Street
on that starry February night, it would
scarcely have occurred to you that the Ghetto
was groaning under the culmination of a
long season of enforced idleness and distress.
The air was exhilaratingly crisp, and the
glare of the cafs and millinery shops flooded
it with contentment and kindly good will.
The sidewalks were alive with shoppers and
promenaders, and lined with peddlers.</p>

<p>Yet the dazzling, deafening chaos had
many a tale of woe to tell. The greater
part of the surging crowd was out on an
errand of self-torture. Straying forlornly
by inexorable window displays, men and
women would pause here and there to indulge
in a hypothetical selection, to feast a
hungry eye upon the object of an imaginary
purchase, only forthwith to pay for the momentary
joy with all the pangs of awakening
to an empty purse.</p>

<p>Many of the peddlers, too, bore piteous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
testimony to the calamity which was then
preying upon the quarter. Some of them
performed their task of yelling and gesticulating
with the desperation of imminent
ruin; others implored the passers-by for
custom with the abject effect of begging
alms; while in still others this feverish urgency
was disguised by an air of martyrdom
or of shamefaced unwontedness, as if peddling
were beneath the dignity of their habitual
occupations, and they had been driven
to it by sheer famine,&mdash;by the hopeless
dearth of employment at their own trades.</p>

<p>One of these was a thick-set fellow of
twenty-five or twenty-six, with honest, clever
blue eyes. It might be due to the genial,
inviting quality of his face that the Passover
dishes whose praises he was sounding had
greater attraction for some of the women
with an "effectual demand" than those of
his competitors. Still, his comparative success
had not as yet reconciled him to his
new calling. He was constantly gazing
about for a possible passer-by of his acquaintance,
and when one came in sight he
would seek refuge from identification in
closer communion with the crockery on his
push-cart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
"Buy nice dishes for the holidays!
Cheap and strong! Buy dishes for Passover!"
When business was brisk, he sang
with a bashful relish; when the interval
between a customer and her successor was
growing too long, his sing-song would acquire
a mournful ring that was suggestive
of the psalm-chanting at an orthodox Jewish
funeral.</p>

<p>He was a cap-blocker, and in the busy
season his earnings ranged from ten to fifteen
dollars a week. But he had not worked
full time for over two years, and during the
last three months he had not been able to
procure a single day's employment.</p>

<p>Goldy, his sweetheart, too, who was employed
in making knee-breeches, had hardly
work enough to pay her humble board and
rent. Nathan, after much hesitation, was
ultimately compelled to take to peddling;
and the longed-for day of their wedding was
put off from month to month.</p>

<p>They had become engaged nearly two
years before; the wedding ceremony having
been originally fixed for a date some three
months later. Their joint savings then
amounted to one hundred and twenty dollars,&mdash;a
sum quite adequate, in Nathan's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
judgment, for a modest, quiet celebration
and the humble beginnings of a household
establishment. Goldy, however, summarily
and indignantly overruled him.</p>

<p>"One does not marry every day," she
argued, "and when I have at last lived to
stand under the bridal canopy with my predestined
one, I will not do so like a beggar-maid.
Give me a respectable wedding, or
none at all, Nathan, do you hear?"</p>

<p>It is to be noted that a "respectable wedding"
was not merely a casual expression
with Goldy. Like its antithesis, a "slipshod
wedding," it played in her vocabulary
the part of something like a well-established
scientific term, with a meaning as clearly
defined as that of "centrifugal force" or
"geometrical progression." Now, a slipshod
wedding was anything short of a gown
of white satin and slippers to match; two
carriages to bring the bride and the bridegroom
to the ceremony, and one to take
them to their bridal apartments; a wedding
bard and a band of at least five musicians;
a spacious ballroom crowded with dancers,
and a feast of a hundred and fifty covers.
As to furniture, she refused to consider any
which did not include a pier-glass and a
Brussels carpet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
Nathan contended that the items upon
which she insisted would cost a sum far beyond
their joint accumulations. This she
met by the declaration that he had all along
been bent upon making her the target of
universal ridicule, and that she would rather
descend into an untimely grave than be
married in a slipshod manner. Here she
burst out crying; and whether her tears
referred to the untimely grave or to the slipshod
wedding, they certainly seemed to
strengthen the cogency of her argument;
for Nathan at once proceeded to signify his
surrender by a kiss, and when ignominiously
repulsed he protested his determination to
earn the necessary money to bring things to
the standard which she held up so uncompromisingly.</p>

<p>Hard times set in. Nathan and Goldy
pinched and scrimped; but all their heroic
economies were powerless to keep their capital
from dribbling down to less than one
hundred dollars. The wedding was postponed
again and again. Finally the curse
of utter idleness fell upon Nathan's careworn
head. Their savings dwindled apace.
In dismay they beheld the foundation of
their happiness melt gradually away. Both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
were tired of boarding. Both longed for
the bliss and economy of married life.
They grew more impatient and restless
every day, and Goldy made concession after
concession. First the wedding supper was
sacrificed; then the pier-mirror and the bard
were stricken from the programme; and
these were eventually succeeded by the hired
hall and the Brussels carpet.</p>

<p>After Nathan went into peddling, a few
days before we first find him hawking chinaware
on Grand Street, matters began to
look brighter, and the spirits of our betrothed
couple rose. Their capital, which
had sunk to forty dollars, was increasing
again, and Goldy advised waiting long
enough for it to reach the sum necessary for
a slipshod wedding and establishment.</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>It was nearly ten o'clock. Nathan was
absently drawling his "Buy nice dishes for
the holidays!" His mind was engrossed
with the question of making peddling his
permanent occupation.</p>

<p>Presently he was startled by a merry soprano
mocking him: "Buy nice di-i-shes!
Mind that you don't fall asleep murmuring
like this. A big lot you can make!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
Nathan turned a smile of affectionate
surprise upon a compact little figure, small
to drollness, but sweet in the amusing grace
of its diminutive outlines,&mdash;an epitome of
exquisite femininity. Her tiny face was as
comically lovely as her form: her apple-like
cheeks were firm as marble, and her inadequate
nose protruded between them like the
result of a hasty tweak; a pair of large,
round black eyes and a thick-lipped little
mouth inundating it all with passion and
restless, good-natured shrewdness.</p>

<p>"Goldy! What brings <em>you</em> here?" Nathan
demanded, with a fond look which instantly
gave way to an air of discomfort.
"You know I hate you to see me peddling."</p>

<p>"Are you really angry? Bite the feather
bed, then. Where is the disgrace? As if
you were the only peddler in America! I
wish you were. Wouldn't you make heaps
of money then! But you had better hear
what <em>does</em> bring me here. Nathan, darling-dearest
little heart, dearest little crown that
you are, guess what a plan I have hit upon!"
she exploded all at once. "Well, if you
hear me out, and you don't say that Goldy
has the head of a cabinet minister, then&mdash;well,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
then you will be a big hog, and nothing
else."</p>

<p>And without giving him time to put in as
much as an interjection, she rattled on, puffing
for breath and smacking her lips for
ecstasy. Was it not stupid of them to be
racking their brains about the wedding while
there was such a plain way of having both
a "respectable" celebration and fine furniture&mdash;Brussels
carpet, pier-glass, and all&mdash;with
the money they now had on hand?</p>

<p>"Come, out with it, then," he said morosely.</p>

<p>But his disguised curiosity only whetted
her appetite for tormenting him, and she
declared her determination not to disclose
her great scheme before they had reached
her lodgings.</p>

<p>"You have been yelling long enough to-day,
anyhow," she said, with abrupt sympathy.
"Do you suppose it does not go to
my very heart to think of the way you stand
out in the cold screaming yourself hoarse?"</p>

<p>Half an hour later, when they were alone
in Mrs. Volpiansky's parlor, which was also
Goldy's bedroom, she set about emptying his
pockets of the gross results of the day's
business, and counting the money. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
she did with a preoccupied, matter-of-fact
air, Nathan submitting to the operation with
fond and amused willingness; and the sum
being satisfactory, she went on to unfold her
plan.</p>

<p>"You see," she began, almost in a whisper,
and with the mien of a careworn, experience-laden
old matron, "in a week or two we
shall have about seventy-five dollars, shan't
we? Well, what is seventy-five dollars?
Nothing! We could just have the plainest
furniture, and no wedding worth speaking of.
Now, if we have no wedding, we shall get
no presents, shall we?"</p>

<p>Nathan shook his head thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Well, why shouldn't we be up to snuff
and do this way? Let us spend all our
money on a grand, respectable wedding, and
send out a big lot of invitations, and then&mdash;well,
won't uncle Leiser send us a carpet or
a parlor set? And aunt Beile, and cousin
Shapiro, and Charley, and Meyerke, and
Wolfke, and Bennie, and Sore-Gitke,&mdash;won't
each present something or other, as is
the custom among respectable people? May
God give us a lump of good luck as big as
the wedding present each of them is sure to
send us! Why, did not Beilke get a fine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
carpet from uncle when she got married?
And am I not a nearer relative than she?"</p>

<p>She paused to search his face for a sign of
approval, and, fondly smoothing a tuft of
his dark hair into place, she went on to
enumerate the friends to be invited and the
gifts to be expected from them.</p>

<p>"So you see," she pursued, "we will have
both a respectable wedding that we shan't
have to be ashamed of in after years and the
nicest things we could get if we spent two
hundred dollars. What do you say?"</p>

<p>"What <em>shall</em> I say?" he returned dubiously.</p>

<p>The project appeared reasonable enough,
but the investment struck him as rather hazardous.
He pleaded for caution, for delay;
but as he had no tangible argument to produce,
while she stood her ground with the
firmness of conviction, her victory was an
easy one.</p>

<p>"It will all come right, depend upon it,"
she said coaxingly. "You just leave everything
to me. Don't be uneasy, Nathan,"
she added. "You and I are orphans, and
you know the Uppermost does not forsake a
bride and bridegroom who have nobody to
take care of them. If my father were alive,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
it would be different," she concluded, with a
disconsolate gesture.</p>

<p>There was a pathetic pause. Tears glistened
in Goldy's eyes.</p>

<p>"May your father rest in a bright paradise,"
Nathan said feelingly. "But what is
the use of crying? Can you bring him back
to life? I will be a father to you."</p>

<p>"If God be pleased," she assented.
"Would that mamma, at least,&mdash;may she
be healthy a hundred and twenty years,&mdash;would
that she, at least, were here to attend
our wedding! Poor mother! it will break
her heart to think that she has not been
foreordained by the Uppermost to lead me
under the canopy."</p>

<p>There was another desolate pause, but it
was presently broken by Goldy, who exclaimed
with unexpected buoyancy, "By the
way, Nathan, guess what I did! I am afraid
you will call me braggart and make fun of
me, but I don't care," she pursued, with a
playful pout, as she produced a strip of carpet
from her pocket-book. "I went into a
furniture store, and they gave me a sample
three times as big as this. I explained in
my letter to mother that this is the kind
of stuff that will cover my floor when I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
married. Then I enclosed the sample in the
letter, and sent it all to Russia."</p>

<p>Nathan clapped his hands and burst out
laughing. "But how do you know that is
just the kind of carpet you will get for your
wedding present?" he demanded, amazed as
much as amused.</p>

<p>"How do I know? As if it mattered
what sort of carpet! I can just see mamma
going the rounds of the neighbors, and showing
off the 'costly tablecloth' her daughter
will trample upon. Won't she be happy!"</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>Over a hundred invitations, printed in as
luxurious a black-and-gold as ever came out
of an Essex Street band-press, were sent
out for an early date in April. Goldy and
Nathan paid a month's rent in advance for
three rooms on the second floor of a Cherry
Street tenement-house. Goldy regarded the
rent as unusually low, and the apartments
as the finest on the East Side.</p>

<p>"Oh, haven't I got lovely rooms!" she
would ejaculate, beaming with the consciousness
of the pronoun. Or, "You ought to
see <em>my</em> rooms! How much do you pay for
yours?" Or again, "I have made up my
mind to have my parlor in the rear room. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
is as light as the front one, anyhow, and I
want that for a kitchen, you know. What
do you say?" For hours together she would
go on talking nothing but rooms, rent, and
furniture; every married couple who had
recently moved into new quarters, or were
about to do so, seemed bound to her by the
ties of a common cause; in her imagination,
humanity was divided into those who were
interested in the question of rooms, rent and
furniture and those who were not,&mdash;the
former, of whom she was one, constituting
the superior category; and whenever her
eye fell upon a bill announcing rooms to let,
she would experience something akin to the
feeling with which an artist, in passing,
views some accessory of his art.</p>

<p>It is customary to send the bulkier wedding
presents to a young couple's apartments
a few days before they become man and wife,
the closer relatives and friends of the betrothed
usually settling among themselves
what piece of furniture each is to contribute.
Accordingly, Goldy gave up her work a week
in advance of the day set for the great event,
in order that she might be on hand to receive
the things when they arrived.</p>

<p>She went to the empty little rooms, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
her lunch, early in the morning, and kept
anxious watch till after nightfall, when Nathan
came to take her home.</p>

<p>A day passed, another, and a third, but
no expressman called out her name. She
sat waiting and listening for the rough
voice, but in vain.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is too early, anyhow. I am a
fool to be expecting anything so soon at
all," she tried to console herself. And she
waited another hour, and still another; but
no wedding gift made its appearance.</p>

<p>"Well, there is plenty of time, after all;
wedding presents do come a day or two before
the ceremony," she argued; and again
she waited, and again strained her ears, and
again her heart rose in her throat.</p>

<p>The vacuity of the rooms, freshly cleaned,
scrubbed, and smelling of whitewash, began
to frighten her. Her over-wrought mind
was filled with sounds which her overstrained
ears did not hear. Yet there she
sat on the window-sill, listening and listening
for an expressman's voice.</p>

<p>"Hush, hush-sh, hush-sh-sh!" whispered
the walls; the corners muttered awful
threats; her heart was ever and anon contracted
with fear; she often thought herself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
on the brink of insanity; yet she stayed on,
waiting, waiting, waiting.</p>

<p>At the slightest noise in the hall she
would spring to her feet, her heart beating
wildly, only presently to sink in her bosom
at finding it to be some neighbor or a peddler;
and so frequent were these violent
throbbings that Goldy grew to imagine herself
a prey to heart disease. Nevertheless
the fifth day came, and she was again at
her post, waiting, waiting, waiting for her
wedding gifts. And what is more, when
Nathan came from business, and his countenance
fell as he surveyed the undisturbed
emptiness of the rooms, she set a merry face
against his rueful inquiries, and took to
bantering him as a woman quick to lose
heart, and to painting their prospects in
roseate hues, until she argued herself, if not
him, into a more cheerful view of the situation.</p>

<p>On the sixth day an expressman did pull
up in front of the Cherry Street tenement-house,
but he had only a cheap huge rocking-chair
for Goldy and Nathan; and as it
proved to be the gift of a family who had
been set down for nothing less than a carpet
or a parlor set, the joy and hope which its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
advent had called forth turned to dire disappointment
and despair. For nearly an hour
Goldy sat mournfully rocking and striving
to picture how delightful it would have been
if all her anticipations had come true.</p>

<p>Presently there arrived a flimsy plush-covered
little corner table. It could not have
cost more than a dollar. Yet it was the gift
of a near friend, who had been relied upon
for a pier-glass or a bedroom set. A little
later a cheap alarm-clock and an ice-box
were brought in. That was all.</p>

<p>Occasionally Goldy went to the door to
take in the entire effect; but the more she
tried to view the parlor as half furnished,
the more cruelly did the few lonely and
mismated things emphasize the remaining
emptiness of the apartments: whereupon
she would sink into her rocker and sit
motionless, with a drooping head, and then
desperately fall to swaying to and fro, as
though bent upon swinging herself out of
her woebegone, wretched self.</p>

<p>Still, when Nathan came, there was a
triumphant twinkle in her eye, as she said,
pointing to the gifts, "Well, mister, who
was right? It is not very bad for a start,
is it? You know most people do send their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
wedding presents after the ceremony,&mdash;why,
of course!" she added, in a sort of confidential
way. "Well, we have invited a
big crowd, and all people of no mean sort,
thank God; and who ever heard of a lady
or a gentleman attending a respectable wedding
and having a grand wedding supper,
and then cheating the bride and the bridegroom
out of their present?"</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>The evening was well advanced; yet there
were only a score of people in a hall that
was used to hundreds.</p>

<p>Everybody felt ill at ease, and ever and
anon looked about for the possible arrival
of more guests. At ten o'clock the dancing
preliminary to the ceremony had not yet
ceased, although the few waltzers looked as
if they were scared by the ringing echoes of
their own footsteps amid the austere solemnity
of the surrounding void and the depressing
sheen of the dim expanse of floor.</p>

<p>The two fiddles, the cornet, and the clarinet
were shrieking as though for pain, and
the malicious superabundance of gaslight
was fiendishly sneering at their tortures.
Weddings and entertainments being scarce
in the Ghetto, its musicians caught the contagion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
of misery: hence the greedy, desperate
gusto with which the band plied their
instruments.</p>

<p>At last it became evident that the assemblage
was not destined to be larger than it
was, and that it was no use delaying the
ceremony. It was, in fact, an open secret
among those present that by far the greater
number of the invited friends were kept
away by lack of employment: some having
their presentable clothes in the pawn shop;
others avoiding the expense of a wedding
present, or simply being too cruelly borne
down by their cares to have a mind for the
excitement of a wedding; indeed, some even
thought it wrong of Nathan to have the
celebration during such a period of hard
times, when everybody was out of work.</p>

<p>It was a little after ten when the bard&mdash;a
tall, gaunt man, with a grizzly beard and
a melancholy face&mdash;donned his skull-cap,
and, advancing toward the dancers, called
out in a synagogue intonation, "Come, ladies,
let us veil the bride!"</p>

<p>An odd dozen of daughters of Israel
followed him and the musicians into a little
side-room where Goldy was seated between
her two brideswomen (the wives of two men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
who were to attend upon the groom). According
to the orthodox custom she had
fasted the whole day, and as a result of this
and of her gnawing grief, added to the awe-inspiring
scene she had been awaiting, she
was pale as death; the effect being heightened
by the wreath and white gown she
wore. As the procession came filing in, she
sat blinking her round dark eyes in dismay,
as if the bard were an executioner come to
lead her to the scaffold.</p>

<p>The song or address to the bride usually
partakes of the qualities of prayer and harangue,
and includes a melancholy meditation
upon life and death; lamenting the
deceased members of the young woman's
family, bemoaning her own woes, and exhorting
her to discharge her sacred duties
as a wife, mother, and servant of God.
Composed in verse and declaimed in a
solemn, plaintive recitative, often broken by
the band's mournful refrain, it is sure to
fulfill its mission of eliciting tears even
when hearts are brimful of glee. Imagine,
then, the funereal effect which it produced
at Goldy's wedding ceremony.</p>

<p>The bard, half starved himself, sang the
anguish of his own heart; the violins wept,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
the clarinet moaned, the cornet and the
double-bass groaned, each reciting the sad
tale of its poverty-stricken master. He
began:&mdash;</p>

<div class="line">Pray to him to bless thy union,</div>
<div class="line">To let thee and thy mate live a hundred and twenty peaceful years,</div>
<div class="line">To give you your daily bread,</div>
<div class="line">To keep hunger from your door."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Several women, including Goldy, burst
into tears, the others sadly lowering their
gaze. The band sounded a wailing chord,
and the whole audience broke into loud,
heartrending weeping.</p>

<p>The bard went on sternly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"Wail, bride, wail!</div>
<div class="line">This is a time of tears.</div>
<div class="line">Think of thy past days:</div>
<div class="line">Alas! they are gone to return nevermore."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Heedless of the convulsive sobbing with
which the room resounded, he continued to
declaim, and at last, his eye flashing fire
and his voice tremulous with emotion, he
sang out in a dismal, uncanny high key:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"And thy good mother beyond the seas,</div>
<div class="line">And thy father in his grave</div>
<div class="line">Near where thy cradle was rocked,&mdash;</div>
<div class="line">Weep, bride, weep!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
Though his soul is better off</div>
<div class="line">Than we are here underneath</div>
<div class="line">In dearth and cares and ceaseless pangs,&mdash;</div>
<div class="line">Weep, sweet bride, weep!"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then, in the general outburst that followed
the extemporaneous verse, there was
a cry,&mdash;"The bride is fainting! Water!
quick!"</p>

<p>"Murderer that you are!" flamed out an
elderly matron, with an air of admiration
for the bard's talent as much as of wrath
for the far-fetched results it achieved.</p>

<p>Goldy was brought to, and the rest of the
ceremony passed without accident. She submitted
to everything as in a dream. When
the bridegroom, escorted by two attendants,
each carrying a candelabrum holding lighted
candles, came to place the veil over her face,
she stared about as though she failed to
realize the situation or to recognize Nathan.
When, keeping time to the plaintive strains
of a time-honored tune, she was led, blindfolded,
into the large hall and stationed beside
the bridegroom under the red canopy,
and then marched around him seven times,
she obeyed instructions and moved about
with the passivity of a hypnotic. After the
Seven Blessings had been recited, when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
cantor, gently lifting the end of her veil,
presented the wineglass to her lips, she
tasted its contents with the air of an invalid
taking medicine. Then she felt the ring
slip down her finger, and heard Nathan say,
"Be thou dedicated to me by this ring, according
to the laws of Moses and Israel."</p>

<p>Whereupon she said to herself, "Now I
am a married woman!" But somehow, at
this moment the words were meaningless
sounds to her. She knew she was married,
but could not realize what it implied. As
Nathan crushed the wineglass underfoot,
and the band struck up a cheerful melody,
and the gathering shouted, "Good luck!
Good luck!" and clapped their hands, while
the older women broke into a wild hop,
Goldy felt the relief of having gone through
a great ordeal. But still she was not distinctly
aware of any change in her position.</p>

<p>Not until fifteen minutes later, when she
found herself in the basement, at the head
of one of three long tables, did the realization
of her new self strike her consciousness
full in the face, as it were.</p>

<p>The dining-room was nearly as large as
the dancing-hall on the floor above. It was
as brightly illuminated, and the three tables,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
which ran almost its entire length, were set
for a hundred and fifty guests. Yet there
were barely twenty to occupy them. The
effect was still more depressing than in the
dancing-room. The vacant benches and the
untouched covers still more agonizingly exaggerated
the emptiness of the room, in
which the sorry handful of a company lost
themselves.</p>

<p>Goldy looked at the rows of plates, spoons,
forks, knives, and they weighed her down
with the cold dazzle of their solemn, pompous
array.</p>

<p>"I am not the Goldy I used to be," she
said to herself. "I am a married woman,
like mamma, or auntie, or Mrs. Volpiansky.
And we have spent every cent we had on
this grand wedding, and now we are left
without money for furniture, and there are
no guests to send us any, and the supper
will be thrown out, and everything is lost,
and I am to blame for it all!"</p>

<p>The glittering plates seemed to hold whispered
converse and to exchange winks and
grins at her expense. She transferred her
glance to the company, and it appeared as if
they were vainly forcing themselves to partake
of the food,&mdash;as though they, too, were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
looked out of countenance by that ruthless
sparkle of the unused plates.</p>

<p>Nervous silence hung over the room, and
the reluctant jingle of the score of knives
and forks made it more awkward, more
enervating, every second. Even the bard
had not the heart to break the stillness by
the merry rhymes he had composed for the
occasion.</p>

<p>Goldy was overpowered. She thought
she was on the verge of another fainting
spell, and, shutting her eyes and setting her
teeth, she tried to imagine herself dead.
Nathan, who was by her side, noticed it.
He took her hand under the table, and,
pressing it gently, whispered, "Don't take
it to heart. There is a God in heaven."</p>

<p>She could not make out his words, but
she felt their meaning. As she was about
to utter some phrase of endearment, her
heart swelled in her throat, and a piteous,
dovelike, tearful look was all the response
she could make.</p>

<p>By and by, however, when the foaming
lager was served, tongues were loosened,
and the bard, although distressed by the
meagre collection in store for him, but
stirred by an ardent desire to relieve the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
insupportable wretchedness of the evening,
outdid himself in offhand acrostics and witticisms.
Needless to say that his efforts
were thankfully rewarded with unstinted
laughter; and as the room rang with merriment,
the gleaming rows of undisturbed
plates also seemed to join in the general
hubbub of mirth, and to be laughing a
hearty, kindly laugh.</p>

<p>Presently, amid a fresh outbreak of deafening
hilarity, Goldy bent close to Nathan's
ear and exclaimed with sobbing vehemence,
"My husband! My husband! My husband!"</p>

<p>"My wife!" he returned in her ear.</p>

<p>"Do you know what you are to me now?"
she resumed. "A husband! And I am
your wife! Do you know what it means,&mdash;<em>do</em>
you, <em>do</em> you, Nathan?" she insisted, with
frantic emphasis.</p>

<p>"I do, my little sparrow; only don't
worry over the wedding presents."</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>It was after midnight, and even the
Ghetto was immersed in repose. Goldy and
Nathan were silently wending their way to
the three empty little rooms where they
were destined to have their first joint home.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
They wore the wedding attire which they
had rented for the evening: he a swallowtail
coat and high hat, and she a white satin
gown and slippers, her head uncovered,&mdash;the
wreath and veil done up in a newspaper,
in Nathan's hand.</p>

<p>They had gone to the wedding in carriages,
which had attracted large crowds
both at the point of departure, and in front
of the hall; and of course they had expected
to make their way to their new home in a
similar "respectable" manner. Toward the
close of the last dance, after supper, they
found, however, that some small change was
all they possessed in the world.</p>

<p>The last strains of music were dying
away. The guests, in their hats and bonnets,
were taking leave. Everybody seemed
in a hurry to get away to his own world,
and to abandon the young couple to their
fate.</p>

<p>Nathan would have borrowed a dollar or
two of some friend. "Let us go home as
behooves a bride and bridegroom," he said.
"There is a God in heaven: he will not forsake
us."</p>

<p>But Goldy would not hear of betraying
the full measure of their poverty to their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
friends. "No! no!" she retorted testily.
"I am not going to let you pay a dollar
and a half for a few blocks' drive, like a
Fifth Avenue nobleman. We can walk,"
she pursued, with the grim determination of
one bent upon self-chastisement. "A poor
woman who dares spend every cent on a
wedding must be ready to walk after the
wedding."</p>

<p>When they found themselves alone in the
deserted street, they were so overcome by a
sense of loneliness, of a kind of portentous,
haunting emptiness, that they could not
speak. So on they trudged in dismal silence;
she leaning upon his arm, and he tenderly
pressing her to his side.</p>

<p>Their way lay through the gloomiest and
roughest part of the Seventh Ward. The
neighborhood frightened her, and she clung
closer to her escort. At one corner they
passed some men in front of a liquor saloon.</p>

<p>"Look at dem! Look at dem! A sheeny
fellar an' his bride, I'll betch ye!" shouted
a husky voice. "Jes' comin' from de weddin'."</p>

<p>"She ain't no bigger 'n a peanut, is she?"
The simile was greeted with a horse-laugh.</p>

<p>"Look a here, young fellar, what's de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
madder wid carryin' dat lady of yourn in
your vest-pocket?"</p>

<p>"When Nathan and Goldy were a block
away, something like a potato or a carrot
struck her in the back. At the same time
the gang of loafers on the corner broke into
boisterous merriment. Nathan tried to face
about, but she restrained him.</p>

<p>"Don't! They might kill you!" she
whispered, and relapsed into silence.</p>

<p>He made another attempt to disengage
himself, as if for a desperate attack upon
her assailants, but she nestled close to his
side and held him fast, her every fibre tingling
with the consciousness of the shelter
she had in him.</p>

<p>"Don't mind them, Nathan," she said.</p>

<p>And as they proceeded on their dreary
way through a sombre, impoverished street,
with here and there a rustling tree,&mdash;a
melancholy witness of its better days,&mdash;they
felt a stream of happiness uniting them,
as it coursed through the veins of both, and
they were filled with a blissful sense of oneness
the like of which they had never tasted
before. So happy were they that the gang
behind them, and the bare rooms toward
which they were directing their steps, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
the miserable failure of the wedding, all
suddenly appeared too insignificant to engage
their attention,&mdash;paltry matters alien
to their new life, remote from the enchanted
world in which they now dwelt.</p>

<p>The very notion of a relentless void abruptly
turned to a beatific sense of their
own seclusion, of there being only themselves
in the universe, to live and to delight
in each other.</p>

<p>"Don't mind them, Nathan darling," she
repeated mechanically, conscious of nothing
but the tremor of happiness in her voice.</p>

<p>"I should give it to them!" he responded,
gathering her still closer to him. "I should
show them how to touch my Goldy, my
pearl, my birdie!"</p>

<p>They dived into the denser gloom of a
side-street.</p>

<p>A gentle breeze ran past and ahead of
them, proclaiming the bride and the bridegroom.
An old tree whispered overhead its
tender felicitations.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
